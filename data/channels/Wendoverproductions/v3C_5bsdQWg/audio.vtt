00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Backblaze and in collaboration

00:05.840 --> 00:09.000
with Alternate History Hub and Real Life Lore.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.400
Russia is immense.

00:10.400 --> 00:16.960
It spans 5,000 miles across, 2,000 miles vertically, crosses 11 time zones, borders everywhere

00:16.960 --> 00:21.080
from Norway to North Korea, and is as close to Anchorage as it is to Amsterdam.

00:21.080 --> 00:26.880
It's huge, but it has a problem—a problem that can explain part of why the average Russian,

00:26.880 --> 00:33.760
living at the same latitude as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Canada, makes only $7,500

00:33.760 --> 00:38.120
American dollars per year—a problem that can explain at least a portion of almost every

00:38.120 --> 00:41.000
political decision the country has ever made.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.320
Russia's geography is flawed.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.920
What you have to remember about Russia is that the majority of Russians live in Europe.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.800
Three quarters of Russia's population lives in the western quarter of the country.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.360
Therefore, as a country with a fairly centralized power system, many of its decisions go to

00:56.360 --> 00:59.080
protect the country core in and around Moscow.

00:59.080 --> 01:04.660
You see, a lot of the success of certain countries over others depends on how well its geography

01:04.660 --> 01:05.720
protects it.

01:05.720 --> 01:11.320
The US, for example, benefited hugely from being an ocean away from every large military

01:11.320 --> 01:12.320
power.

01:12.320 --> 01:16.480
The only real armed forces that could threaten the US in its infancy were in Europe or Asia

01:16.480 --> 01:22.060
and therefore any invasion would require trans-oceanic supply lines which are hugely expensive and

01:22.060 --> 01:26.040
logistically difficult therefore weakening an invading army.

01:26.040 --> 01:29.320
On the European continent, France has a similar situation.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.780
Their northwestern border is protected by the English Channel, their western border

01:32.780 --> 01:36.680
by the Atlantic Ocean, their southern border by the Pyrenees Mountains and the Mediterranean

01:36.680 --> 01:41.440
Ocean, their southeastern by the Alps Mountains, and their northeastern by the Rhine River.

01:41.440 --> 01:46.840
The eastern half of their northern border is, however, largely unprotected geographically—a

01:46.840 --> 01:51.760
flawed Germany exploited in both World War I and World War II by invading through Belgium

01:51.760 --> 01:52.760
and Luxembourg.

01:53.000 --> 01:57.800
But the protection still did concentrate attacks into a choke point and kept it significantly

01:57.800 --> 02:00.760
more protected than other European countries.

02:00.760 --> 02:05.440
Here's Cody from Alternate History Hub to explain Russia's territorial expansion.

02:05.440 --> 02:10.800
Russia's first territorial expansion was entirely a quest for power, starting when

02:10.800 --> 02:17.160
it unified into a single East Slavic state in 882, but over time this expanse for glory

02:17.160 --> 02:21.120
transformed into an effort to protect the core of the country.

02:21.120 --> 02:24.640
This early Russia was very unprotected and vulnerable.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.720
There was no geographic protection to keep foreigners from migrating into Russian lands.

02:29.720 --> 02:34.760
The only natural resource the fledgling nation had at their disposal was pure manpower.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.480
In the coming centuries, what was then known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow quickly expanded.

02:40.480 --> 02:44.960
By the time Ivan the Terrible was crowned ruler of the Tsardom of Russia, the country

02:44.960 --> 02:50.920
had spread its borders east to the Urals, south to the Caucasus, and west to the Carpathian

02:50.920 --> 02:51.920
Mountains.

02:51.920 --> 02:57.700
Eventually even Siberia was conquered which, before then, was an independent Khanate—a

02:57.700 --> 02:59.380
territory ruled by a Khan.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.320
That was Cody from Alternate History Hub.

03:01.320 --> 03:05.040
I collaborated with him to make a great video on his channel about what the world would

03:05.040 --> 03:08.880
be like if Russia had never become its own country which I'll link in the description

03:08.880 --> 03:10.760
and at the end of the video.

03:10.760 --> 03:16.440
Now with all this territory, Russia, or at least Moscow, had some serious protection.

03:16.440 --> 03:21.100
Siberia is large enough that no army could invade through it and make it to Moscow.

03:21.100 --> 03:26.280
The supply lines would have to be thousands of miles long through inhospitable conditions.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.700
Not only that, but the army with a one or two thousand mile long supply line would then

03:30.700 --> 03:34.240
have to make it over the Ural Mountains to get to Moscow.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.840
Attacking from the south or west would also take an army either across water or through

03:38.840 --> 03:39.840
mountains.

03:39.840 --> 03:45.360
By the time the 19th century rolled in, Russia had truly become an unconquerable power.

03:45.360 --> 03:49.960
Countries could and can take over portions of Russia, but there is no conceivable way

03:49.960 --> 03:53.920
that a single country could fully occupy and conquer Russia.

03:53.920 --> 03:59.800
To occupy a territory of that size, a country would need an estimated 13 million trained

03:59.800 --> 04:04.200
ground troops—more than the 17 largest militaries combined.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.560
However, despite its defenses, Russia has never developed economically to the same level

04:09.560 --> 04:11.360
as some of its neighbors.

04:11.360 --> 04:17.360
Its GDP per capita is right around that of Mauritius, Grenada, and Turkey and this, once

04:17.360 --> 04:21.480
again, can be at least partially attributed to geography.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.520
Historically, naval power equaled power.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.100
The two were synonymous.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.380
There was no better way for countries to project their power and grow their economy than to

04:30.380 --> 04:33.200
have a powerful navy and merchant fleet.

04:33.200 --> 04:38.640
Many of the most powerful countries today—the United Kingdom, Japan, and China, for example—were

04:38.640 --> 04:41.480
ones that once had the most powerful navies in the world.

04:41.480 --> 04:46.940
There's a reason that none of the 18 largest economies in the world are landlocked countries.

04:46.940 --> 04:51.880
Up until the last century, maritime shipping was the fastest way to get goods and people

04:51.880 --> 04:56.600
across the world and it's still the cheapest way to ship goods long distance.

04:56.600 --> 05:01.680
Having good water access allows countries to trade with the world, but Russia, despite

05:01.680 --> 05:08.400
its 23,000 miles of coastline, has no significant warm water ice-free ports with direct access

05:08.400 --> 05:09.520
to an ocean.

05:09.520 --> 05:16.620
Alaska does, Canada does, Iceland does, Norway does, and Sweden too, but Russia is fundamentally

05:16.620 --> 05:21.740
limited in its maritime power because it has no easy way to access the world's oceans

05:21.740 --> 05:22.840
year-round.

05:22.840 --> 05:27.360
The port of Novorossiysk is ice-free, but its throughput is limited by the depth and

05:27.360 --> 05:28.600
size of the port.

05:28.600 --> 05:33.240
St. Petersburg also has an important port, but it freezes for many months of the year.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.980
On the Pacific side, ports like Vladivlastok also occasionally freeze during the winter,

05:38.020 --> 05:40.780
but the ice is not the biggest problem with these ports.

05:40.780 --> 05:44.540
The biggest problem is that their access to the world's oceans is all through choke

05:44.540 --> 05:48.220
points controlled by either NATO countries or NATO allies.

05:48.220 --> 05:52.060
To get to the ocean from Novorossiysk, you need to pass through the Bosphorus strait

05:52.060 --> 05:54.700
which is controlled by Turkey—a NATO country.

05:54.700 --> 05:58.260
To get to the ocean from St. Petersburg, you need to pass through the Danish straits controlled

05:58.260 --> 06:00.420
by Denmark—also a NATO country.

06:00.420 --> 06:04.240
And to get to the ocean from Vladivostok and many of the other Pacific ports, you need

06:04.240 --> 06:09.120
to pass through the Sea of Japan which is controlled by Japan—a close ally of NATO.

06:09.120 --> 06:14.060
If Russia ever decided to attack a NATO country or ally, their access to the world's oceans

06:14.060 --> 06:18.400
would be restricted by these NATO countries because the NATO treaty includes a mutual

06:18.400 --> 06:22.580
defense pact—if one country is attacked, all respond.

06:22.580 --> 06:26.520
This would cripple both Russia's navy and economy.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.000
Now back to defenses.

06:28.000 --> 06:34.020
There's one major flaw to Russia's geographical defense system—the Northern European plane.

06:34.020 --> 06:38.920
Whereas every other border has a geographical defense preventing easy invasion from a foreign

06:38.920 --> 06:44.060
army, this completely flat plane just acts as a funnel easily bringing an army from western

06:44.060 --> 06:45.700
Europe right up to Moscow.

06:45.700 --> 06:50.060
While a large part of the Soviet Union's motive to expand into eastern Europe was to

06:50.060 --> 06:54.860
spread the socialist revolution, Stalin still believed that he needed to create a zone of

06:54.860 --> 06:59.740
buffer states in order to defend against the threat of the USA and its allies in western

06:59.740 --> 07:00.740
Europe.

07:00.740 --> 07:05.920
With its influence over all of eastern Europe, the USSR had both manpower and political power

07:05.920 --> 07:08.980
to keep the west far from Moscow.

07:08.980 --> 07:13.380
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to strive to keep political

07:13.380 --> 07:14.900
power in the region.

07:14.900 --> 07:18.940
Out of the 15 states that emerged, 12 joined the Commonwealth of Independent States with

07:18.940 --> 07:23.860
Russia essentially aligning them politically with Russia while 3 joined both NATO and the

07:23.860 --> 07:28.040
European Union—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.

07:28.040 --> 07:33.640
That means that, on paper, Russia still has a strong political buffer between it and western

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
Europe.

07:34.640 --> 07:39.360
The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and the countries of Belarus and Ukraine covered almost

07:39.360 --> 07:41.680
all of the Northern European plane.

07:41.680 --> 07:46.400
Not only that, but Russia used its influence in Ukraine to sign a long-term lease on the

07:46.400 --> 07:51.840
warm water port of Sevastopol which greatly expanded the naval capabilities of Russia's

07:51.840 --> 07:53.160
Black Sea fleet.

07:53.160 --> 07:58.120
Except, Ukraine as a whole progressed to be more and more pro-European in the decades

07:58.120 --> 08:03.200
following the fall of the Soviet Union which was a major reason for Russia's invasion

08:03.200 --> 08:04.200
of Crimea.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.260
While on the surface Putin might have claimed Russia's invasion was to save the Russians

08:08.260 --> 08:13.680
of the area from the increasingly westernizing country, the annexation of Crimea was in reality

08:13.680 --> 08:17.720
a strategic imperative to keep the warm water port of Sevastopol.

08:17.720 --> 08:21.840
A Ukraine that was friendlier to the west likely would have ended Russia's lease on

08:21.840 --> 08:26.980
the port so in Putin's mind he needed to invade Crimea in order to prevent a crippling

08:26.980 --> 08:29.520
blow to Russia's ocean access.

08:29.520 --> 08:34.800
Now, Russia has managed to overcome many of its geographic challenges partially because

08:34.800 --> 08:38.000
of two things—oil and natural gas.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.640
It has enormous energy reserves partially because of its enormous size.

08:42.640 --> 08:48.080
Russian natural gas pipelines provide for 40% of Europe's natural gas demand.

08:48.080 --> 08:53.420
Some countries, such as Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland, are almost fully

08:53.420 --> 08:56.280
dependent on Russia for their natural gas.

08:56.280 --> 09:01.040
This gas dependency is a major reason why Germany, for example, a country with high

09:01.040 --> 09:05.500
Russian oil dependency, is much less likely to criticize Russia than a country like the

09:05.500 --> 09:09.140
UK which has virtually zero Russian gas dependency.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.800
If Russia shut off the gas to Germany, it would devastate them, but stopping gas exports

09:13.800 --> 09:16.280
to the UK would have little effect.

09:16.280 --> 09:21.320
The US has attempted to reduce Russian influence in Europe by exporting liquefied natural gas

09:21.320 --> 09:22.640
across the Atlantic.

09:22.640 --> 09:27.760
It costs more, but it allows western European countries to buy their energy from their American

09:27.760 --> 09:28.760
ally.

09:28.760 --> 09:32.280
Now, none of this discussion of ports and power is to say that if there was no Norway

09:32.280 --> 09:36.000
or Sweden blocking the way to the ocean and the water was a bit warmer, Russia would be

09:36.000 --> 09:37.520
the Sweden of the east.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.880
Saying that would be foolish.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.600
Geography does have an enormous influence on human development, but it doesn't determine

09:43.600 --> 09:44.600
it.

09:44.600 --> 09:50.800
Geography is defined by chance, not circumstance, because, in the end, reality is just the confluence

09:50.800 --> 09:53.460
of chance and circumstance.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.960
This video was made possible by Backblaze.

09:55.960 --> 09:59.380
So I was going to do this big, complicated pitch where I figured out the value of computer

09:59.380 --> 10:03.680
data in order to calculate the return on investment for signing up to Backblaze, but then it was

10:03.680 --> 10:07.440
pointed out to me that you already know that you should back up your data.

10:07.440 --> 10:11.440
It's like brushing your teeth, doing the dishes, taking out the trash, it's something

10:11.440 --> 10:16.260
that you know you should do but don't want to because it's easy to ignore it.

10:16.260 --> 10:21.100
The only thing is backing up your data doesn't have to be difficult or expensive.

10:21.100 --> 10:25.880
With Backblaze, you just download their application to your computer, pay $5 per month, and it

10:25.880 --> 10:29.000
works in the background continuously backing up your data.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.040
You can just completely forget about it.

10:31.040 --> 10:36.120
If you ever do lose your data, all you have to do is sign into your account at backblaze.com

10:36.120 --> 10:37.520
and download your data.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.200
If your internet isn't fast enough, they even have an option to ship you a physical

10:41.200 --> 10:42.600
drive with your data instead.

10:42.600 --> 10:48.480
What's best is that you can try this out for free for 15 days by using the link backblaze.com

10:48.480 --> 10:50.000

10:50.000 --> 10:54.640
If you lose your data during those 15 days you'll still get it back at no cost.

10:54.640 --> 11:00.200
After that, it's only $5 per month for the peace of mind of knowing that, no matter what,

11:00.200 --> 11:01.880

I want to remind you to check out the video that Alternate History Hub made about what

11:20.480 --> 11:22.640
the world would be like if Russia didn't exist.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.760
It's a great video and then he collaborated with Real Life Lore to make another great

11:26.760 --> 11:30.880
video about what would happen if the Soviet Union reunited.

11:30.880 --> 11:35.600
