0	5840	This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Backblaze and in collaboration
5840	9000	with Alternate History Hub and Real Life Lore.
9000	10400	Russia is immense.
10400	16960	It spans 5,000 miles across, 2,000 miles vertically, crosses 11 time zones, borders everywhere
16960	21080	from Norway to North Korea, and is as close to Anchorage as it is to Amsterdam.
21080	26880	It's huge, but it has a problem—a problem that can explain part of why the average Russian,
26880	33760	living at the same latitude as Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, and Canada, makes only $7,500
33760	38120	American dollars per year—a problem that can explain at least a portion of almost every
38120	41000	political decision the country has ever made.
41000	43320	Russia's geography is flawed.
43320	47920	What you have to remember about Russia is that the majority of Russians live in Europe.
47920	51800	Three quarters of Russia's population lives in the western quarter of the country.
51800	56360	Therefore, as a country with a fairly centralized power system, many of its decisions go to
56360	59080	protect the country core in and around Moscow.
59080	64660	You see, a lot of the success of certain countries over others depends on how well its geography
64660	65720	protects it.
65720	71320	The US, for example, benefited hugely from being an ocean away from every large military
71320	72320	power.
72320	76480	The only real armed forces that could threaten the US in its infancy were in Europe or Asia
76480	82060	and therefore any invasion would require trans-oceanic supply lines which are hugely expensive and
82060	86040	logistically difficult therefore weakening an invading army.
86040	89320	On the European continent, France has a similar situation.
89320	92780	Their northwestern border is protected by the English Channel, their western border
92780	96680	by the Atlantic Ocean, their southern border by the Pyrenees Mountains and the Mediterranean
96680	101440	Ocean, their southeastern by the Alps Mountains, and their northeastern by the Rhine River.
101440	106840	The eastern half of their northern border is, however, largely unprotected geographically—a
106840	111760	flawed Germany exploited in both World War I and World War II by invading through Belgium
111760	112760	and Luxembourg.
113000	117800	But the protection still did concentrate attacks into a choke point and kept it significantly
117800	120760	more protected than other European countries.
120760	125440	Here's Cody from Alternate History Hub to explain Russia's territorial expansion.
125440	130800	Russia's first territorial expansion was entirely a quest for power, starting when
130800	137160	it unified into a single East Slavic state in 882, but over time this expanse for glory
137160	141120	transformed into an effort to protect the core of the country.
141120	144640	This early Russia was very unprotected and vulnerable.
144640	149720	There was no geographic protection to keep foreigners from migrating into Russian lands.
149720	154760	The only natural resource the fledgling nation had at their disposal was pure manpower.
154760	160480	In the coming centuries, what was then known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow quickly expanded.
160480	164960	By the time Ivan the Terrible was crowned ruler of the Tsardom of Russia, the country
164960	170920	had spread its borders east to the Urals, south to the Caucasus, and west to the Carpathian
170920	171920	Mountains.
171920	177700	Eventually even Siberia was conquered which, before then, was an independent Khanate—a
177700	179380	territory ruled by a Khan.
179380	181320	That was Cody from Alternate History Hub.
181320	185040	I collaborated with him to make a great video on his channel about what the world would
185040	188880	be like if Russia had never become its own country which I'll link in the description
188880	190760	and at the end of the video.
190760	196440	Now with all this territory, Russia, or at least Moscow, had some serious protection.
196440	201100	Siberia is large enough that no army could invade through it and make it to Moscow.
201100	206280	The supply lines would have to be thousands of miles long through inhospitable conditions.
206280	210700	Not only that, but the army with a one or two thousand mile long supply line would then
210700	214240	have to make it over the Ural Mountains to get to Moscow.
214240	218840	Attacking from the south or west would also take an army either across water or through
218840	219840	mountains.
219840	225360	By the time the 19th century rolled in, Russia had truly become an unconquerable power.
225360	229960	Countries could and can take over portions of Russia, but there is no conceivable way
229960	233920	that a single country could fully occupy and conquer Russia.
233920	239800	To occupy a territory of that size, a country would need an estimated 13 million trained
239800	244200	ground troops—more than the 17 largest militaries combined.
244200	249560	However, despite its defenses, Russia has never developed economically to the same level
249560	251360	as some of its neighbors.
251360	257360	Its GDP per capita is right around that of Mauritius, Grenada, and Turkey and this, once
257360	261480	again, can be at least partially attributed to geography.
261480	264520	Historically, naval power equaled power.
264520	266100	The two were synonymous.
266100	270380	There was no better way for countries to project their power and grow their economy than to
270380	273200	have a powerful navy and merchant fleet.
273200	278640	Many of the most powerful countries today—the United Kingdom, Japan, and China, for example—were
278640	281480	ones that once had the most powerful navies in the world.
281480	286940	There's a reason that none of the 18 largest economies in the world are landlocked countries.
286940	291880	Up until the last century, maritime shipping was the fastest way to get goods and people
291880	296600	across the world and it's still the cheapest way to ship goods long distance.
296600	301680	Having good water access allows countries to trade with the world, but Russia, despite
301680	308400	its 23,000 miles of coastline, has no significant warm water ice-free ports with direct access
308400	309520	to an ocean.
309520	316620	Alaska does, Canada does, Iceland does, Norway does, and Sweden too, but Russia is fundamentally
316620	321740	limited in its maritime power because it has no easy way to access the world's oceans
321740	322840	year-round.
322840	327360	The port of Novorossiysk is ice-free, but its throughput is limited by the depth and
327360	328600	size of the port.
328600	333240	St. Petersburg also has an important port, but it freezes for many months of the year.
333240	337980	On the Pacific side, ports like Vladivlastok also occasionally freeze during the winter,
338020	340780	but the ice is not the biggest problem with these ports.
340780	344540	The biggest problem is that their access to the world's oceans is all through choke
344540	348220	points controlled by either NATO countries or NATO allies.
348220	352060	To get to the ocean from Novorossiysk, you need to pass through the Bosphorus strait
352060	354700	which is controlled by Turkey—a NATO country.
354700	358260	To get to the ocean from St. Petersburg, you need to pass through the Danish straits controlled
358260	360420	by Denmark—also a NATO country.
360420	364240	And to get to the ocean from Vladivostok and many of the other Pacific ports, you need
364240	369120	to pass through the Sea of Japan which is controlled by Japan—a close ally of NATO.
369120	374060	If Russia ever decided to attack a NATO country or ally, their access to the world's oceans
374060	378400	would be restricted by these NATO countries because the NATO treaty includes a mutual
378400	382580	defense pact—if one country is attacked, all respond.
382580	386520	This would cripple both Russia's navy and economy.
386520	388000	Now back to defenses.
388000	394020	There's one major flaw to Russia's geographical defense system—the Northern European plane.
394020	398920	Whereas every other border has a geographical defense preventing easy invasion from a foreign
398920	404060	army, this completely flat plane just acts as a funnel easily bringing an army from western
404060	405700	Europe right up to Moscow.
405700	410060	While a large part of the Soviet Union's motive to expand into eastern Europe was to
410060	414860	spread the socialist revolution, Stalin still believed that he needed to create a zone of
414860	419740	buffer states in order to defend against the threat of the USA and its allies in western
419740	420740	Europe.
420740	425920	With its influence over all of eastern Europe, the USSR had both manpower and political power
425920	428980	to keep the west far from Moscow.
428980	433380	Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia has continued to strive to keep political
433380	434900	power in the region.
434900	438940	Out of the 15 states that emerged, 12 joined the Commonwealth of Independent States with
438940	443860	Russia essentially aligning them politically with Russia while 3 joined both NATO and the
443860	448040	European Union—Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.
448040	453640	That means that, on paper, Russia still has a strong political buffer between it and western
453640	454640	Europe.
454640	459360	The Russian exclave of Kaliningrad and the countries of Belarus and Ukraine covered almost
459360	461680	all of the Northern European plane.
461680	466400	Not only that, but Russia used its influence in Ukraine to sign a long-term lease on the
466400	471840	warm water port of Sevastopol which greatly expanded the naval capabilities of Russia's
471840	473160	Black Sea fleet.
473160	478120	Except, Ukraine as a whole progressed to be more and more pro-European in the decades
478120	483200	following the fall of the Soviet Union which was a major reason for Russia's invasion
483200	484200	of Crimea.
484200	488260	While on the surface Putin might have claimed Russia's invasion was to save the Russians
488260	493680	of the area from the increasingly westernizing country, the annexation of Crimea was in reality
493680	497720	a strategic imperative to keep the warm water port of Sevastopol.
497720	501840	A Ukraine that was friendlier to the west likely would have ended Russia's lease on
501840	506980	the port so in Putin's mind he needed to invade Crimea in order to prevent a crippling
506980	509520	blow to Russia's ocean access.
509520	514800	Now, Russia has managed to overcome many of its geographic challenges partially because
514800	518000	of two things—oil and natural gas.
518000	522640	It has enormous energy reserves partially because of its enormous size.
522640	528080	Russian natural gas pipelines provide for 40% of Europe's natural gas demand.
528080	533420	Some countries, such as Bulgaria, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland, are almost fully
533420	536280	dependent on Russia for their natural gas.
536280	541040	This gas dependency is a major reason why Germany, for example, a country with high
541040	545500	Russian oil dependency, is much less likely to criticize Russia than a country like the
545500	549140	UK which has virtually zero Russian gas dependency.
549140	553800	If Russia shut off the gas to Germany, it would devastate them, but stopping gas exports
553800	556280	to the UK would have little effect.
556280	561320	The US has attempted to reduce Russian influence in Europe by exporting liquefied natural gas
561320	562640	across the Atlantic.
562640	567760	It costs more, but it allows western European countries to buy their energy from their American
567760	568760	ally.
568760	572280	Now, none of this discussion of ports and power is to say that if there was no Norway
572280	576000	or Sweden blocking the way to the ocean and the water was a bit warmer, Russia would be
576000	577520	the Sweden of the east.
577520	578880	Saying that would be foolish.
578880	583600	Geography does have an enormous influence on human development, but it doesn't determine
583600	584600	it.
584600	590800	Geography is defined by chance, not circumstance, because, in the end, reality is just the confluence
590800	593460	of chance and circumstance.
