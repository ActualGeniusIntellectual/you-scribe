00:00.000 --> 00:06.220
Behind any commercial flight is more than a century of political negotiation and accords

00:06.220 --> 00:10.580
that dictate who, how, and where airlines can fly.

00:10.580 --> 00:15.680
Aviation is one of the most unifying industries worldwide because it is what brings the world

00:15.680 --> 00:16.680
together.

00:16.680 --> 00:21.480
The beginning of aviation agreements came with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International

00:21.480 --> 00:23.080
Civil Aviation.

00:23.080 --> 00:28.800
This convention established the UN oversight agency responsible for civil aviation—the

00:28.800 --> 00:31.140
International Civil Aviation Organization.

00:31.140 --> 00:38.500
The ICAO is recognized by every country worldwide except for Liechtenstein, Dominica, and Tuvalu.

00:38.500 --> 00:43.400
Of those, Tuvalu is the sole country to have an international airport so that means that

00:43.400 --> 00:48.320
all but one sky-faring nation worldwide is part of the ICAO.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.940
Soon after its inception, the ICAO laid out five fundamental rights of aviation—known

00:53.940 --> 00:58.660
as the five freedoms of the air which serve as a framework for international aviation

00:58.660 --> 00:59.780
agreements.

00:59.780 --> 01:05.340
Each freedom has varying levels of acceptance, but every developed country worldwide grants

01:05.340 --> 01:08.580
these rights to certain foreign airlines.

01:08.580 --> 01:13.460
The first freedom of the air is the right to fly over a foreign country without landing.

01:13.460 --> 01:17.540
Pretty much every commercial flight and commercial airline is allowed to do this.

01:17.540 --> 01:22.140
There are exceptions—the EU has a list of hundreds supposedly unsafe airlines that are

01:22.140 --> 01:28.100
not allowed in EU airspace—but there are no large airlines today restricted from certain

01:28.100 --> 01:29.100
airspace.

01:29.100 --> 01:33.540
It may seem like a given that foreign airlines can overfly countries, but the airspace above

01:33.540 --> 01:38.340
a country is sovereign territory of that country—more or less.

01:38.340 --> 01:42.920
There isn't actually an internationally recognized line of separation between sovereign

01:42.920 --> 01:45.100
airspace and space.

01:45.100 --> 01:49.740
Some say it's 19 miles above sea level—the highest altitude balloons and airplanes can

01:49.740 --> 01:55.220
fly—while others say it's as high as 99 miles—the altitude of the lowest stable

01:55.220 --> 01:57.060
orbits around earth.

01:57.060 --> 02:02.860
The US classifies anyone who's flown 50 miles or higher above earth as an astronaut.

02:02.860 --> 02:08.500
So that therefore means that the US recognizes 50 miles above earth as the beginning of space.

02:08.500 --> 02:14.020
However, there are instances in which the US hasn't respected sovereignty below 50

02:14.020 --> 02:15.020
miles.

02:15.020 --> 02:19.500
When space shuttle missions returned to earth, they did so much like an airplane with a slow,

02:19.500 --> 02:22.100
horizontal descent down to a runway.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.780
Their descent paths were so long that they had to descend over foreign nations, such

02:26.780 --> 02:29.860
as Canada, below 50 miles altitude.

02:29.860 --> 02:34.900
And yet the US never requested permission from Canada to fly in their airspace.

02:34.900 --> 02:38.940
Just because airlines are allowed to fly over foreign countries doesn't mean that they

02:38.940 --> 02:41.520
can do so without restriction.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.560
Of course they need to be in contact with air traffic control, but they also need to

02:45.560 --> 02:48.740
pay what's known as overflight fees.

02:48.740 --> 02:52.620
Overflight fees are how airlines pay foreign countries they fly over but don't land or

02:52.620 --> 02:57.120
take off in for the use of their air traffic control services.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.020
Airlines still have to pay to use air traffic control in countries they land or take off

03:01.020 --> 03:06.820
in, but these fees are paid and calculated in different ways depending on the country.

03:06.820 --> 03:09.300
Overflight fees are nearly universal.

03:09.300 --> 03:15.480
The US, for example, charges $56.86 per 100 nautical miles.

03:15.480 --> 03:20.180
You may think that these fees are fairly inconsequential since the only international flights that

03:20.180 --> 03:25.960
really fly over the US without landing are flights to, from, or between Mexico, Canada,

03:25.960 --> 03:27.560
and some Caribbean nations.

03:27.560 --> 03:33.640
However, the US is actually responsible for a huge amount of airspace—way larger than

03:33.640 --> 03:35.340
the US itself.

03:35.340 --> 03:41.080
It was allocated this airspace by the International Civil Aviation Organization and since it provides

03:41.080 --> 03:45.660
air traffic control for this area, it also charges overflight fees.

03:45.660 --> 03:50.480
This does mean, weirdly, that flights from Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,

03:50.480 --> 03:55.820
and other Melanesian countries pay overflight fees to the US when flying to northeast Asian

03:55.820 --> 03:59.720
destinations such as Japan, Korea, and China.

03:59.720 --> 04:07.120
In US oceanic airspace, however, airlines only pay $21.63 per 100 nautical miles.

04:07.120 --> 04:11.960
It may seem like these small charges would have little effect, but on long-haul flights,

04:11.960 --> 04:14.280
overflight fees can really add up.

04:14.280 --> 04:18.200
Especially with the razor thin airline margins that you learned about in my why flying is

04:18.200 --> 04:23.180
so expensive video, airlines do have to put consideration into where they fly based on

04:23.180 --> 04:24.740
overflight fees.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.820
Canadian overflight fees are notoriously expensive.

04:27.820 --> 04:32.400
They work on a variable cost structure based on takeoff weight and distance flown so I

04:32.400 --> 04:34.360
won't go into actual numbers.

04:34.600 --> 04:39.240
Almost any flight originating in the US has to fly through expensive Canadian airspace

04:39.240 --> 04:43.540
en route to Europe, as you learned about in my video about the north Atlantic tracks,

04:43.540 --> 04:46.720
but airlines do have strategies to lower these costs.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.360
The most efficient route between San Francisco and Frankfurt goes north through Montana,

04:51.360 --> 04:56.120
up over northeast Canada, then across Greenland, Iceland, and down into Europe.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.340
However, airlines don't always use this route.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.420
On certain days with certain wind and weather conditions, they'll fly east through the

05:03.500 --> 05:08.740
United States, then enter Canadian airspace somewhere over Minneapolis or Chicago so that

05:08.740 --> 05:11.660
they'll pay less in Canadian overflight fees.

05:11.660 --> 05:16.100
Complicated route planning software takes all the variables—weight, weather, overflight

05:16.100 --> 05:21.420
fees, etc.—and figures out which route is most financially efficient, even if it wastes

05:21.420 --> 05:23.540
time or fuel.

05:23.540 --> 05:27.540
Moving on, the second freedom of the air is the right for airlines to land in foreign

05:27.540 --> 05:29.460
countries for technical stops.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.740
Essentially, that means refueling.

05:31.740 --> 05:37.060
Modern airplanes have ranges of up to 9,000 miles so there's little need anymore for

05:37.060 --> 05:42.020
refueling stops, but in the past, they were crucial for long-haul flights.

05:42.020 --> 05:47.420
Shannon Airport, in western Ireland, once received hundreds of flights per day despite

05:47.420 --> 05:51.420
being located in an exceptionally rural area.

05:51.420 --> 05:57.740
The nearest large city to Shannon, Limerick, has a population of less than 100,000, but

05:57.740 --> 06:03.180
geographically, Shannon Airport is the nearest airport to the US so back when airplanes had

06:03.180 --> 06:08.580
shorter ranges, they'd make a stop to refuel in Shannon before continuing on to their continental

06:08.580 --> 06:11.020
European destinations.

06:11.020 --> 06:16.820
During the era of the Soviet Union, almost no airline had permission to overfly the USSR

06:16.820 --> 06:21.020
so airlines had to literally go the other way around the earth.

06:21.020 --> 06:26.020
Nearly every flight between Europe and Asia was routed with a technical stop in Anchorage,

06:26.020 --> 06:27.700
Alaska to refuel.

06:27.700 --> 06:30.100
Obviously this was incredibly inefficient.

06:30.100 --> 06:35.020
Today's direct Europe-Asia flights take between 10 and 12 hours but back when they

06:35.020 --> 06:39.640
stopped in Anchorage, they took as many as 22 hours.

06:39.640 --> 06:44.180
Despite the huge range of airplanes today, there are still some flights that require

06:44.180 --> 06:45.600
refueling stops.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.880
Australia and New Zealand are almost exactly on the opposite side of the world from London

06:50.880 --> 06:55.160
so any flight between the two places has to make a stop somewhere.

06:55.160 --> 07:00.080
On its London-Sydney flights, Qantas Airlines makes a stop in Dubai and on flights between

07:00.080 --> 07:04.320
London and Auckland, Air New Zealand stops in Los Angeles.

07:04.320 --> 07:09.680
It is expected, however, that within weeks or days of this video going up, Qantas Airlines

07:09.680 --> 07:15.040
will announce a new direct route between Perth in Western Australia and London with their

07:15.040 --> 07:20.600
787-900 Dreamliners which would be the first direct commercial service in history between

07:20.600 --> 07:22.720
Europe and Australia.

07:22.720 --> 07:29.280
This 9,000 mile trek would take an immense 18 hours to connect the two continents.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.480
The third freedom of the air is pretty simple.

07:31.480 --> 07:36.120
It's the right to fly commercially from one's own country to another country.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.960
This is just like Air France flying Paris to New York or Singapore Airlines flying Singapore

07:40.960 --> 07:42.640
to Dubai.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.720
Almost every international airline is granted this third freedom.

07:46.720 --> 07:50.620
The fourth freedom is just the inverse of this—the right to fly commercially from

07:50.620 --> 07:53.100
another country to one's own.

07:53.100 --> 07:57.900
There are really no instances where the third and fourth freedoms are granted separately.

07:57.900 --> 08:03.040
If an airline is allowed to fly somewhere, they're also allowed to fly back with passengers.

08:03.040 --> 08:07.340
The fifth and final official freedom is the right for an airline to fly passengers between

08:07.340 --> 08:12.300
two foreign countries on a flight originating or terminating in their own country.

08:12.300 --> 08:16.400
Now this is very similar to the second freedom and the second freedom and fifth freedoms

08:16.400 --> 08:19.540
are often but not always granted together.

08:19.540 --> 08:24.020
With the second freedom, Qantas is allowed to stop in Dubai to refuel, but if they're

08:24.020 --> 08:28.340
granted the fifth freedom, Qantas is also allowed to pick up new paying passengers in

08:28.340 --> 08:30.880
Dubai and fly them to London.

08:30.880 --> 08:35.340
Some examples of this freedom include Air India's New York, London, Hyderabad route

08:35.340 --> 08:40.020
which is allowed to fly passengers between New York and London, Cathay Pacific's Hong

08:40.020 --> 08:44.460
Kong, Vancouver, New York route which is allowed to fly passengers between Vancouver and New

08:44.460 --> 08:49.920
York, and Ethiopian airlines Addis Abada, Dublin, Los Angeles flight which is allowed

08:49.920 --> 08:54.860
to fly passengers between Los Angeles and Dublin, but let's move on to the sixth freedom.

08:54.860 --> 08:59.740
It may seem a little strange that there's a sixth freedom in the five freedoms of aviation.

08:59.740 --> 09:04.800
There are actually nine total freedoms, but only the first five are recognized officially

09:04.800 --> 09:08.160
in the ICAO's five freedoms treaty.

09:08.160 --> 09:12.760
While freedoms six through nine are widely accepted, they are not as universal except

09:12.760 --> 09:14.080
for number six.

09:14.080 --> 09:18.520
The sixth freedom is actually unbelievably common—it's the right for an airline to

09:18.520 --> 09:23.620
transport passengers from one foreign country to another via their own country.

09:23.620 --> 09:28.520
This is just like Air France taking passengers from New York to Dubai via Paris or Korean

09:28.520 --> 09:32.660
airlines taking passengers from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Seoul.

09:32.660 --> 09:37.320
As you can tell, having six freedom rights is basically a fancy way to say airlines are

09:37.320 --> 09:39.420
allowed to connect passengers.

09:39.420 --> 09:44.380
There are whole airlines that operate almost exclusively using six freedom rights.

09:44.380 --> 09:49.620
Wow Airlines and Icelandair take passengers from North America to Europe via Reykjavik

09:49.620 --> 09:54.860
and Turkish, Qatar, Ethiad, and Emirates airlines take passengers mostly between Europe,

09:54.860 --> 09:58.540
Africa, and Asia via their middle eastern hubs.

09:58.540 --> 10:02.260
While each of these airlines do have some passengers only taking a direct flight to

10:02.260 --> 10:07.480
their hub, the vast majority of their traffic is connecting due to their geographic positions

10:07.480 --> 10:09.360
between population centers.

10:09.360 --> 10:14.300
I'll finish off by grouping the seventh, eighth, and ninth freedoms together as you'll

10:14.300 --> 10:17.120
see they're quite similar and often come together.

10:17.120 --> 10:21.620
The seventh freedom allows an airline to fly between two foreign nations without connecting

10:21.620 --> 10:23.240
onto its home.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.040
The eighth freedom is the right for an airline to fly between two cities in one foreign country

10:28.040 --> 10:30.360
while continuing onto its own country.

10:30.360 --> 10:35.260
And the ninth and final freedom is the right for a foreign airline to fly between two points

10:35.260 --> 10:38.780
in a foreign country without continuing onto its own country.

10:38.780 --> 10:44.520
It's extremely rare for these freedoms to be granted except for in the European Union.

10:44.520 --> 10:50.060
You see, the European Union has a single aviation market meaning that any airline registered

10:50.060 --> 10:56.420
in an EU country is allowed to fly flights between, to, and from any airport in the EU.

10:56.420 --> 11:00.540
Budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet thrive on this regulation.

11:00.540 --> 11:06.440
Despite being an Irish airline, Ryanair is allowed to fly routes like Edinburgh to London,

11:06.440 --> 11:12.060
Paris to Lyon, and other domestic routes in foreign EU countries due to this single aviation

11:12.060 --> 11:13.060
market.

11:13.060 --> 11:18.140
There are almost no other instances where foreign airlines are allowed to fly domestic

11:18.140 --> 11:19.140
routes.

11:19.140 --> 11:24.180
Ryanair is also allowed to fly routes between two other EU countries, like Paris to Berlin,

11:24.180 --> 11:29.420
and from other EU countries to outside the EU, such as Barcelona to Fez, Morocco.

11:29.420 --> 11:34.220
This is also how Norwegian Airlines is allowed to fly long haul from Sweden, Denmark, and

11:34.220 --> 11:38.340
the UK to the US… well, more or less.

11:38.340 --> 11:42.740
You may recall that Norway is actually not part of the European Union, so they're not

11:42.740 --> 11:47.800
part of the EU's single aviation market, but interestingly, Norwegian Airlines is actually

11:47.800 --> 11:53.580
registered in Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the UK in order to gain access to the

11:53.580 --> 11:58.380
EU's single aviation market as well as the Open Skies Treaty that allows unlimited and

11:58.380 --> 12:01.540
unrestricted flights between the EU and the US.

12:01.540 --> 12:06.340
There's one really interesting use of these treaties and regulations in the form of short

12:06.340 --> 12:09.780
haul flights between the Caribbean and the United States.

12:09.780 --> 12:14.840
Norwegian Airlines offers flights during the winter months from Boston, New York, and Baltimore

12:14.840 --> 12:19.400
to Martinique and Guadeloupe, and these aren't extensions to their long haul flights using

12:19.400 --> 12:21.160
fifth freedom rights.

12:21.160 --> 12:24.420
These are standalone flights in small airplanes.

12:24.420 --> 12:28.500
Boston and Baltimore don't even have Norwegian transatlantic flights.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.520
Normally a flight like this would never be allowed but since Martinique is an overseas

12:31.520 --> 12:36.540
region and Guadeloupe is an overseas territory of France, they're also part of the EU's

12:36.540 --> 12:39.900
single aviation market and the Open Skies Treaty.

12:39.900 --> 12:44.780
So those are the five, or rather nine freedoms of aviation.

12:44.780 --> 12:48.900
Aviation is a very politically charged and complicated subject but these freedoms do

12:48.900 --> 12:54.500
a great job of simplifying and standardizing airline regulations worldwide.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.660
