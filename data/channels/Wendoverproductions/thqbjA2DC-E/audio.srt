1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
Behind any commercial flight is more than a century of political negotiation and accords

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,580
that dictate who, how, and where airlines can fly.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:15,680
Aviation is one of the most unifying industries worldwide because it is what brings the world

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
together.

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,480
The beginning of aviation agreements came with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,080
Civil Aviation.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,800
This convention established the UN oversight agency responsible for civil aviation—the

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,140
International Civil Aviation Organization.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,500
The ICAO is recognized by every country worldwide except for Liechtenstein, Dominica, and Tuvalu.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,400
Of those, Tuvalu is the sole country to have an international airport so that means that

11
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,320
all but one sky-faring nation worldwide is part of the ICAO.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,940
Soon after its inception, the ICAO laid out five fundamental rights of aviation—known

13
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,660
as the five freedoms of the air which serve as a framework for international aviation

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,780
agreements.

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:05,340
Each freedom has varying levels of acceptance, but every developed country worldwide grants

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,580
these rights to certain foreign airlines.

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,460
The first freedom of the air is the right to fly over a foreign country without landing.

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,540
Pretty much every commercial flight and commercial airline is allowed to do this.

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,140
There are exceptions—the EU has a list of hundreds supposedly unsafe airlines that are

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,100
not allowed in EU airspace—but there are no large airlines today restricted from certain

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,100
airspace.

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,540
It may seem like a given that foreign airlines can overfly countries, but the airspace above

23
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,340
a country is sovereign territory of that country—more or less.

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,920
There isn't actually an internationally recognized line of separation between sovereign

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,100
airspace and space.

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,740
Some say it's 19 miles above sea level—the highest altitude balloons and airplanes can

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,220
fly—while others say it's as high as 99 miles—the altitude of the lowest stable

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,060
orbits around earth.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,860
The US classifies anyone who's flown 50 miles or higher above earth as an astronaut.

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,500
So that therefore means that the US recognizes 50 miles above earth as the beginning of space.

31
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,020
However, there are instances in which the US hasn't respected sovereignty below 50

32
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,020
miles.

33
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,500
When space shuttle missions returned to earth, they did so much like an airplane with a slow,

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,100
horizontal descent down to a runway.

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,780
Their descent paths were so long that they had to descend over foreign nations, such

36
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,860
as Canada, below 50 miles altitude.

37
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,900
And yet the US never requested permission from Canada to fly in their airspace.

38
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,940
Just because airlines are allowed to fly over foreign countries doesn't mean that they

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,520
can do so without restriction.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,560
Of course they need to be in contact with air traffic control, but they also need to

41
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,740
pay what's known as overflight fees.

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,620
Overflight fees are how airlines pay foreign countries they fly over but don't land or

43
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,120
take off in for the use of their air traffic control services.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,020
Airlines still have to pay to use air traffic control in countries they land or take off

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,820
in, but these fees are paid and calculated in different ways depending on the country.

46
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,300
Overflight fees are nearly universal.

47
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,480
The US, for example, charges $56.86 per 100 nautical miles.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,180
You may think that these fees are fairly inconsequential since the only international flights that

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,960
really fly over the US without landing are flights to, from, or between Mexico, Canada,

50
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,560
and some Caribbean nations.

51
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,640
However, the US is actually responsible for a huge amount of airspace—way larger than

52
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,340
the US itself.

53
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,080
It was allocated this airspace by the International Civil Aviation Organization and since it provides

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,660
air traffic control for this area, it also charges overflight fees.

55
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:50,480
This does mean, weirdly, that flights from Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,

56
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,820
and other Melanesian countries pay overflight fees to the US when flying to northeast Asian

57
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:59,720
destinations such as Japan, Korea, and China.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:07,120
In US oceanic airspace, however, airlines only pay $21.63 per 100 nautical miles.

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,960
It may seem like these small charges would have little effect, but on long-haul flights,

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,280
overflight fees can really add up.

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,200
Especially with the razor thin airline margins that you learned about in my why flying is

62
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,180
so expensive video, airlines do have to put consideration into where they fly based on

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,740
overflight fees.

64
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,820
Canadian overflight fees are notoriously expensive.

65
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,400
They work on a variable cost structure based on takeoff weight and distance flown so I

66
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,360
won't go into actual numbers.

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,240
Almost any flight originating in the US has to fly through expensive Canadian airspace

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,540
en route to Europe, as you learned about in my video about the north Atlantic tracks,

69
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,720
but airlines do have strategies to lower these costs.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,360
The most efficient route between San Francisco and Frankfurt goes north through Montana,

71
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,120
up over northeast Canada, then across Greenland, Iceland, and down into Europe.

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,340
However, airlines don't always use this route.

73
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,420
On certain days with certain wind and weather conditions, they'll fly east through the

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,740
United States, then enter Canadian airspace somewhere over Minneapolis or Chicago so that

75
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,660
they'll pay less in Canadian overflight fees.

76
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,100
Complicated route planning software takes all the variables—weight, weather, overflight

77
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,420
fees, etc.—and figures out which route is most financially efficient, even if it wastes

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,540
time or fuel.

79
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,540
Moving on, the second freedom of the air is the right for airlines to land in foreign

80
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,460
countries for technical stops.

81
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,740
Essentially, that means refueling.

82
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,060
Modern airplanes have ranges of up to 9,000 miles so there's little need anymore for

83
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,020
refueling stops, but in the past, they were crucial for long-haul flights.

84
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:47,420
Shannon Airport, in western Ireland, once received hundreds of flights per day despite

85
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,420
being located in an exceptionally rural area.

86
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,740
The nearest large city to Shannon, Limerick, has a population of less than 100,000, but

87
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,180
geographically, Shannon Airport is the nearest airport to the US so back when airplanes had

88
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:08,580
shorter ranges, they'd make a stop to refuel in Shannon before continuing on to their continental

89
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,020
European destinations.

90
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,820
During the era of the Soviet Union, almost no airline had permission to overfly the USSR

91
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,020
so airlines had to literally go the other way around the earth.

92
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,020
Nearly every flight between Europe and Asia was routed with a technical stop in Anchorage,

93
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,700
Alaska to refuel.

94
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,100
Obviously this was incredibly inefficient.

95
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,020
Today's direct Europe-Asia flights take between 10 and 12 hours but back when they

96
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,640
stopped in Anchorage, they took as many as 22 hours.

97
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,180
Despite the huge range of airplanes today, there are still some flights that require

98
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,600
refueling stops.

99
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,880
Australia and New Zealand are almost exactly on the opposite side of the world from London

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,160
so any flight between the two places has to make a stop somewhere.

101
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,080
On its London-Sydney flights, Qantas Airlines makes a stop in Dubai and on flights between

102
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,320
London and Auckland, Air New Zealand stops in Los Angeles.

103
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,680
It is expected, however, that within weeks or days of this video going up, Qantas Airlines

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,040
will announce a new direct route between Perth in Western Australia and London with their

105
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,600
787-900 Dreamliners which would be the first direct commercial service in history between

106
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,720
Europe and Australia.

107
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,280
This 9,000 mile trek would take an immense 18 hours to connect the two continents.

108
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,480
The third freedom of the air is pretty simple.

109
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,120
It's the right to fly commercially from one's own country to another country.

110
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,960
This is just like Air France flying Paris to New York or Singapore Airlines flying Singapore

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,640
to Dubai.

112
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,720
Almost every international airline is granted this third freedom.

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,620
The fourth freedom is just the inverse of this—the right to fly commercially from

114
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,100
another country to one's own.

115
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,900
There are really no instances where the third and fourth freedoms are granted separately.

116
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,040
If an airline is allowed to fly somewhere, they're also allowed to fly back with passengers.

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,340
The fifth and final official freedom is the right for an airline to fly passengers between

118
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,300
two foreign countries on a flight originating or terminating in their own country.

119
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,400
Now this is very similar to the second freedom and the second freedom and fifth freedoms

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,540
are often but not always granted together.

121
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,020
With the second freedom, Qantas is allowed to stop in Dubai to refuel, but if they're

122
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,340
granted the fifth freedom, Qantas is also allowed to pick up new paying passengers in

123
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,880
Dubai and fly them to London.

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,340
Some examples of this freedom include Air India's New York, London, Hyderabad route

125
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,020
which is allowed to fly passengers between New York and London, Cathay Pacific's Hong

126
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,460
Kong, Vancouver, New York route which is allowed to fly passengers between Vancouver and New

127
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,920
York, and Ethiopian airlines Addis Abada, Dublin, Los Angeles flight which is allowed

128
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,860
to fly passengers between Los Angeles and Dublin, but let's move on to the sixth freedom.

129
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:59,740
It may seem a little strange that there's a sixth freedom in the five freedoms of aviation.

130
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,800
There are actually nine total freedoms, but only the first five are recognized officially

131
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,160
in the ICAO's five freedoms treaty.

132
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,760
While freedoms six through nine are widely accepted, they are not as universal except

133
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
for number six.

134
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,520
The sixth freedom is actually unbelievably common—it's the right for an airline to

135
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,620
transport passengers from one foreign country to another via their own country.

136
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,520
This is just like Air France taking passengers from New York to Dubai via Paris or Korean

137
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,660
airlines taking passengers from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Seoul.

138
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,320
As you can tell, having six freedom rights is basically a fancy way to say airlines are

139
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,420
allowed to connect passengers.

140
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,380
There are whole airlines that operate almost exclusively using six freedom rights.

141
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:49,620
Wow Airlines and Icelandair take passengers from North America to Europe via Reykjavik

142
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,860
and Turkish, Qatar, Ethiad, and Emirates airlines take passengers mostly between Europe,

143
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,540
Africa, and Asia via their middle eastern hubs.

144
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:02,260
While each of these airlines do have some passengers only taking a direct flight to

145
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:07,480
their hub, the vast majority of their traffic is connecting due to their geographic positions

146
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,360
between population centers.

147
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,300
I'll finish off by grouping the seventh, eighth, and ninth freedoms together as you'll

148
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,120
see they're quite similar and often come together.

149
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,620
The seventh freedom allows an airline to fly between two foreign nations without connecting

150
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,240
onto its home.

151
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,040
The eighth freedom is the right for an airline to fly between two cities in one foreign country

152
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,360
while continuing onto its own country.

153
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,260
And the ninth and final freedom is the right for a foreign airline to fly between two points

154
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,780
in a foreign country without continuing onto its own country.

155
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:44,520
It's extremely rare for these freedoms to be granted except for in the European Union.

156
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,060
You see, the European Union has a single aviation market meaning that any airline registered

157
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:56,420
in an EU country is allowed to fly flights between, to, and from any airport in the EU.

158
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,540
Budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet thrive on this regulation.

159
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,440
Despite being an Irish airline, Ryanair is allowed to fly routes like Edinburgh to London,

160
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,060
Paris to Lyon, and other domestic routes in foreign EU countries due to this single aviation

161
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
market.

162
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,140
There are almost no other instances where foreign airlines are allowed to fly domestic

163
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,140
routes.

164
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,180
Ryanair is also allowed to fly routes between two other EU countries, like Paris to Berlin,

165
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,420
and from other EU countries to outside the EU, such as Barcelona to Fez, Morocco.

166
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,220
This is also how Norwegian Airlines is allowed to fly long haul from Sweden, Denmark, and

167
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,340
the UK to the US… well, more or less.

168
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,740
You may recall that Norway is actually not part of the European Union, so they're not

169
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,800
part of the EU's single aviation market, but interestingly, Norwegian Airlines is actually

170
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,580
registered in Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the UK in order to gain access to the

171
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:58,380
EU's single aviation market as well as the Open Skies Treaty that allows unlimited and

172
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,540
unrestricted flights between the EU and the US.

173
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,340
There's one really interesting use of these treaties and regulations in the form of short

174
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,780
haul flights between the Caribbean and the United States.

175
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,840
Norwegian Airlines offers flights during the winter months from Boston, New York, and Baltimore

176
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:19,400
to Martinique and Guadeloupe, and these aren't extensions to their long haul flights using

177
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,160
fifth freedom rights.

178
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,420
These are standalone flights in small airplanes.

179
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,500
Boston and Baltimore don't even have Norwegian transatlantic flights.

180
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,520
Normally a flight like this would never be allowed but since Martinique is an overseas

181
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:36,540
region and Guadeloupe is an overseas territory of France, they're also part of the EU's

182
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,900
single aviation market and the Open Skies Treaty.

183
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,780
So those are the five, or rather nine freedoms of aviation.

184
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,900
Aviation is a very politically charged and complicated subject but these freedoms do

185
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,500
a great job of simplifying and standardizing airline regulations worldwide.

186
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,660
I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.
