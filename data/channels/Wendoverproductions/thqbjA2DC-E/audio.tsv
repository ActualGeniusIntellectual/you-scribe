0	6220	Behind any commercial flight is more than a century of political negotiation and accords
6220	10580	that dictate who, how, and where airlines can fly.
10580	15680	Aviation is one of the most unifying industries worldwide because it is what brings the world
15680	16680	together.
16680	21480	The beginning of aviation agreements came with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International
21480	23080	Civil Aviation.
23080	28800	This convention established the UN oversight agency responsible for civil aviation—the
28800	31140	International Civil Aviation Organization.
31140	38500	The ICAO is recognized by every country worldwide except for Liechtenstein, Dominica, and Tuvalu.
38500	43400	Of those, Tuvalu is the sole country to have an international airport so that means that
43400	48320	all but one sky-faring nation worldwide is part of the ICAO.
48320	53940	Soon after its inception, the ICAO laid out five fundamental rights of aviation—known
53940	58660	as the five freedoms of the air which serve as a framework for international aviation
58660	59780	agreements.
59780	65340	Each freedom has varying levels of acceptance, but every developed country worldwide grants
65340	68580	these rights to certain foreign airlines.
68580	73460	The first freedom of the air is the right to fly over a foreign country without landing.
73460	77540	Pretty much every commercial flight and commercial airline is allowed to do this.
77540	82140	There are exceptions—the EU has a list of hundreds supposedly unsafe airlines that are
82140	88100	not allowed in EU airspace—but there are no large airlines today restricted from certain
88100	89100	airspace.
89100	93540	It may seem like a given that foreign airlines can overfly countries, but the airspace above
93540	98340	a country is sovereign territory of that country—more or less.
98340	102920	There isn't actually an internationally recognized line of separation between sovereign
102920	105100	airspace and space.
105100	109740	Some say it's 19 miles above sea level—the highest altitude balloons and airplanes can
109740	115220	fly—while others say it's as high as 99 miles—the altitude of the lowest stable
115220	117060	orbits around earth.
117060	122860	The US classifies anyone who's flown 50 miles or higher above earth as an astronaut.
122860	128500	So that therefore means that the US recognizes 50 miles above earth as the beginning of space.
128500	134020	However, there are instances in which the US hasn't respected sovereignty below 50
134020	135020	miles.
135020	139500	When space shuttle missions returned to earth, they did so much like an airplane with a slow,
139500	142100	horizontal descent down to a runway.
142100	146780	Their descent paths were so long that they had to descend over foreign nations, such
146780	149860	as Canada, below 50 miles altitude.
149860	154900	And yet the US never requested permission from Canada to fly in their airspace.
154900	158940	Just because airlines are allowed to fly over foreign countries doesn't mean that they
158940	161520	can do so without restriction.
161520	165560	Of course they need to be in contact with air traffic control, but they also need to
165560	168740	pay what's known as overflight fees.
168740	172620	Overflight fees are how airlines pay foreign countries they fly over but don't land or
172620	177120	take off in for the use of their air traffic control services.
177120	181020	Airlines still have to pay to use air traffic control in countries they land or take off
181020	186820	in, but these fees are paid and calculated in different ways depending on the country.
186820	189300	Overflight fees are nearly universal.
189300	195480	The US, for example, charges $56.86 per 100 nautical miles.
195480	200180	You may think that these fees are fairly inconsequential since the only international flights that
200180	205960	really fly over the US without landing are flights to, from, or between Mexico, Canada,
205960	207560	and some Caribbean nations.
207560	213640	However, the US is actually responsible for a huge amount of airspace—way larger than
213640	215340	the US itself.
215340	221080	It was allocated this airspace by the International Civil Aviation Organization and since it provides
221080	225660	air traffic control for this area, it also charges overflight fees.
225660	230480	This does mean, weirdly, that flights from Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea,
230480	235820	and other Melanesian countries pay overflight fees to the US when flying to northeast Asian
235820	239720	destinations such as Japan, Korea, and China.
239720	247120	In US oceanic airspace, however, airlines only pay $21.63 per 100 nautical miles.
247120	251960	It may seem like these small charges would have little effect, but on long-haul flights,
251960	254280	overflight fees can really add up.
254280	258200	Especially with the razor thin airline margins that you learned about in my why flying is
258200	263180	so expensive video, airlines do have to put consideration into where they fly based on
263180	264740	overflight fees.
264740	267820	Canadian overflight fees are notoriously expensive.
267820	272400	They work on a variable cost structure based on takeoff weight and distance flown so I
272400	274360	won't go into actual numbers.
274600	279240	Almost any flight originating in the US has to fly through expensive Canadian airspace
279240	283540	en route to Europe, as you learned about in my video about the north Atlantic tracks,
283540	286720	but airlines do have strategies to lower these costs.
286720	291360	The most efficient route between San Francisco and Frankfurt goes north through Montana,
291360	296120	up over northeast Canada, then across Greenland, Iceland, and down into Europe.
296120	299340	However, airlines don't always use this route.
299340	303420	On certain days with certain wind and weather conditions, they'll fly east through the
303500	308740	United States, then enter Canadian airspace somewhere over Minneapolis or Chicago so that
308740	311660	they'll pay less in Canadian overflight fees.
311660	316100	Complicated route planning software takes all the variables—weight, weather, overflight
316100	321420	fees, etc.—and figures out which route is most financially efficient, even if it wastes
321420	323540	time or fuel.
323540	327540	Moving on, the second freedom of the air is the right for airlines to land in foreign
327540	329460	countries for technical stops.
329460	331740	Essentially, that means refueling.
331740	337060	Modern airplanes have ranges of up to 9,000 miles so there's little need anymore for
337060	342020	refueling stops, but in the past, they were crucial for long-haul flights.
342020	347420	Shannon Airport, in western Ireland, once received hundreds of flights per day despite
347420	351420	being located in an exceptionally rural area.
351420	357740	The nearest large city to Shannon, Limerick, has a population of less than 100,000, but
357740	363180	geographically, Shannon Airport is the nearest airport to the US so back when airplanes had
363180	368580	shorter ranges, they'd make a stop to refuel in Shannon before continuing on to their continental
368580	371020	European destinations.
371020	376820	During the era of the Soviet Union, almost no airline had permission to overfly the USSR
376820	381020	so airlines had to literally go the other way around the earth.
381020	386020	Nearly every flight between Europe and Asia was routed with a technical stop in Anchorage,
386020	387700	Alaska to refuel.
387700	390100	Obviously this was incredibly inefficient.
390100	395020	Today's direct Europe-Asia flights take between 10 and 12 hours but back when they
395020	399640	stopped in Anchorage, they took as many as 22 hours.
399640	404180	Despite the huge range of airplanes today, there are still some flights that require
404180	405600	refueling stops.
405600	410880	Australia and New Zealand are almost exactly on the opposite side of the world from London
410880	415160	so any flight between the two places has to make a stop somewhere.
415160	420080	On its London-Sydney flights, Qantas Airlines makes a stop in Dubai and on flights between
420080	424320	London and Auckland, Air New Zealand stops in Los Angeles.
424320	429680	It is expected, however, that within weeks or days of this video going up, Qantas Airlines
429680	435040	will announce a new direct route between Perth in Western Australia and London with their
435040	440600	787-900 Dreamliners which would be the first direct commercial service in history between
440600	442720	Europe and Australia.
442720	449280	This 9,000 mile trek would take an immense 18 hours to connect the two continents.
449280	451480	The third freedom of the air is pretty simple.
451480	456120	It's the right to fly commercially from one's own country to another country.
456120	460960	This is just like Air France flying Paris to New York or Singapore Airlines flying Singapore
460960	462640	to Dubai.
462640	466720	Almost every international airline is granted this third freedom.
466720	470620	The fourth freedom is just the inverse of this—the right to fly commercially from
470620	473100	another country to one's own.
473100	477900	There are really no instances where the third and fourth freedoms are granted separately.
477900	483040	If an airline is allowed to fly somewhere, they're also allowed to fly back with passengers.
483040	487340	The fifth and final official freedom is the right for an airline to fly passengers between
487340	492300	two foreign countries on a flight originating or terminating in their own country.
492300	496400	Now this is very similar to the second freedom and the second freedom and fifth freedoms
496400	499540	are often but not always granted together.
499540	504020	With the second freedom, Qantas is allowed to stop in Dubai to refuel, but if they're
504020	508340	granted the fifth freedom, Qantas is also allowed to pick up new paying passengers in
508340	510880	Dubai and fly them to London.
510880	515340	Some examples of this freedom include Air India's New York, London, Hyderabad route
515340	520020	which is allowed to fly passengers between New York and London, Cathay Pacific's Hong
520020	524460	Kong, Vancouver, New York route which is allowed to fly passengers between Vancouver and New
524460	529920	York, and Ethiopian airlines Addis Abada, Dublin, Los Angeles flight which is allowed
529920	534860	to fly passengers between Los Angeles and Dublin, but let's move on to the sixth freedom.
534860	539740	It may seem a little strange that there's a sixth freedom in the five freedoms of aviation.
539740	544800	There are actually nine total freedoms, but only the first five are recognized officially
544800	548160	in the ICAO's five freedoms treaty.
548160	552760	While freedoms six through nine are widely accepted, they are not as universal except
552760	554080	for number six.
554080	558520	The sixth freedom is actually unbelievably common—it's the right for an airline to
558520	563620	transport passengers from one foreign country to another via their own country.
563620	568520	This is just like Air France taking passengers from New York to Dubai via Paris or Korean
568520	572660	airlines taking passengers from Frankfurt to Tokyo via Seoul.
572660	577320	As you can tell, having six freedom rights is basically a fancy way to say airlines are
577320	579420	allowed to connect passengers.
579420	584380	There are whole airlines that operate almost exclusively using six freedom rights.
584380	589620	Wow Airlines and Icelandair take passengers from North America to Europe via Reykjavik
589620	594860	and Turkish, Qatar, Ethiad, and Emirates airlines take passengers mostly between Europe,
594860	598540	Africa, and Asia via their middle eastern hubs.
598540	602260	While each of these airlines do have some passengers only taking a direct flight to
602260	607480	their hub, the vast majority of their traffic is connecting due to their geographic positions
607480	609360	between population centers.
609360	614300	I'll finish off by grouping the seventh, eighth, and ninth freedoms together as you'll
614300	617120	see they're quite similar and often come together.
617120	621620	The seventh freedom allows an airline to fly between two foreign nations without connecting
621620	623240	onto its home.
623240	628040	The eighth freedom is the right for an airline to fly between two cities in one foreign country
628040	630360	while continuing onto its own country.
630360	635260	And the ninth and final freedom is the right for a foreign airline to fly between two points
635260	638780	in a foreign country without continuing onto its own country.
638780	644520	It's extremely rare for these freedoms to be granted except for in the European Union.
644520	650060	You see, the European Union has a single aviation market meaning that any airline registered
650060	656420	in an EU country is allowed to fly flights between, to, and from any airport in the EU.
656420	660540	Budget airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet thrive on this regulation.
660540	666440	Despite being an Irish airline, Ryanair is allowed to fly routes like Edinburgh to London,
666440	672060	Paris to Lyon, and other domestic routes in foreign EU countries due to this single aviation
672060	673060	market.
673060	678140	There are almost no other instances where foreign airlines are allowed to fly domestic
678140	679140	routes.
679140	684180	Ryanair is also allowed to fly routes between two other EU countries, like Paris to Berlin,
684180	689420	and from other EU countries to outside the EU, such as Barcelona to Fez, Morocco.
689420	694220	This is also how Norwegian Airlines is allowed to fly long haul from Sweden, Denmark, and
694220	698340	the UK to the US… well, more or less.
698340	702740	You may recall that Norway is actually not part of the European Union, so they're not
702740	707800	part of the EU's single aviation market, but interestingly, Norwegian Airlines is actually
707800	713580	registered in Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and the UK in order to gain access to the
713580	718380	EU's single aviation market as well as the Open Skies Treaty that allows unlimited and
718380	721540	unrestricted flights between the EU and the US.
721540	726340	There's one really interesting use of these treaties and regulations in the form of short
726340	729780	haul flights between the Caribbean and the United States.
729780	734840	Norwegian Airlines offers flights during the winter months from Boston, New York, and Baltimore
734840	739400	to Martinique and Guadeloupe, and these aren't extensions to their long haul flights using
739400	741160	fifth freedom rights.
741160	744420	These are standalone flights in small airplanes.
744420	748500	Boston and Baltimore don't even have Norwegian transatlantic flights.
748500	751520	Normally a flight like this would never be allowed but since Martinique is an overseas
751520	756540	region and Guadeloupe is an overseas territory of France, they're also part of the EU's
756540	759900	single aviation market and the Open Skies Treaty.
759900	764780	So those are the five, or rather nine freedoms of aviation.
764780	768900	Aviation is a very politically charged and complicated subject but these freedoms do
768900	774500	a great job of simplifying and standardizing airline regulations worldwide.
