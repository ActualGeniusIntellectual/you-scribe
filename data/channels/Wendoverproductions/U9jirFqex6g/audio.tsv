0	3800	When the world thinks of Europe, they think of the trains.
3800	8120	No continent's countries have so collectively chosen to develop such dense and efficient
8120	10200	networks of passenger railways.
10200	14520	One can step on a train above the Arctic Circle in Narvik, Norway, travel exclusively on the
14520	18120	rails, and end up all the way at the continent's border with Asia and Istanbul.
18120	19920	But it's not going to be efficient.
19920	24280	That's because, while possible, this routing touches on the network's fatal flaw.
24280	28040	France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and others have each developed some of the world's
28040	33720	most efficient and effective rail networks, but they're just not well connected.
33720	36880	Take Milan, for example, Europe's eighth largest metro area.
36880	40960	While a world-leading network exists south to the rest of Italy and north into nearby
40960	46160	Switzerland, just three trains go farther—a fairly frequent service to Paris, a once-daily
46160	49800	trip to Frankfurt, and an overnight train to Munich and Vienna.
49800	52400	This isn't an isolated edge case.
52400	56460	Paris and Madrid are the European Union's two largest metro areas, and yet they have
56460	58900	zero direct trains running between them.
58900	62660	In fact, the farthest one can travel from France's borders on a direct high-speed
62660	67020	train from Paris is London, Amsterdam, Munich, or Milan.
67020	72660	And not only is there a dearth of direct trains, but connections are hardly straightforward.
72660	77340	A Herculean effort went into digging a tunnel from France to the UK to connect the two countries'
77340	82820	rail networks, and yet in practice, they connect London to the continent—not England, and
82820	85020	certainly not the UK.
85020	88720	Several constraints currently prevent practical cross-border passenger service beyond London,
88720	92680	or by anyone but Eurostar, but the Eurostar service does little to integrate with the
92680	94900	UK's existing domestic network.
94900	98940	To travel from Paris to Manchester, for example, one must individually book the Eurostar from
98940	103140	Paris to London, then upon arrival, walk 20 minutes from St. Pancras to Euston Station
103140	107340	to take another train, which also must be booked individually, up to Manchester.
107340	111040	The fact that this itinerary cannot be booked as a single ticket both means people are less
111040	114720	likely to identify it as a possibility, and that if the first train is delayed enough
114720	118800	that the second is missed, there's no obligation for the operator to rebook the traveler onto
118800	119800	the next one.
119800	124120	So, while only four hours of train travel stand between France's largest and the UK's
124120	128620	second largest city, a competitive number versus air travel, these inefficiencies functionally
128620	131800	increase it to an untenable level.
131800	136480	The competitor, planes, also significantly undercut trains on fares.
136480	141040	Unlike airlines, who price connecting itineraries lower than direct to compensate for the inconvenience,
141040	144200	the fact that the two segments of this trip must be booked separately, and are therefore
144200	148560	priced separately, makes this functionally impossible, even if it would be a winning
148560	149800	strategy.
149800	153800	One would be lucky to find a combination of train fares totaling $150 between Paris and
153800	158640	Manchester, while airfares on this route typically sit below $100.
158640	161780	This phenomena is consistent continent-wide.
161780	166720	Average train fares between Paris and Barcelona typically sit three times higher than airfares.
166720	169880	From Amsterdam to London, it's four times higher.
169880	174180	Cases like Milan to Frankfurt do exist, where trains only cost marginally more, but that's
174180	175280	not the average.
175280	180640	In Europe, crossing borders by rail is more expensive and less convenient.
180640	183220	This is no coincidence.
183220	186860	The better part of a century ago, as Europe rebuilt and reconnected in the wake of World
186860	192100	War II, countries across the continent searched for opportunities to revitalize their war-torn
192100	193100	economies.
193100	196940	A number of them, especially warm, southern nations like Spain and Italy, identified the
196940	199140	potential of tourism.
199140	203360	This conveniently coincided with the opening of the Jet Age, in which new aircraft development
203360	207120	and economies of scale made air travel faster and more affordable.
207120	210500	Packaged holiday providers took advantage of this to offer increasingly inexpensive
210500	215140	trips to increasingly far-flung destinations, and some even went further to set up airlines
215140	219680	entirely dedicated to flying vacationers like Condor and Britannia Airways.
219680	223840	As travel abroad became affordable, cooler coastal towns closer to home, like England's
223840	228180	Margate, Torquay, and Blackpool, started a slow slide into ruin.
228180	233340	But simultaneously, to the south, tourist numbers exploded, as sunny seaside towns quickly
233340	236000	developed into destinations.
236000	240940	The oil crisis in the 70s stunted this growth, but it soon accelerated again in the 90s as
240940	245580	the business model pioneered by Condor, Britannia, and others was refined and innovated upon.
245580	248180	The budget airline was formed.
248180	252660	Ryanair, EasyJet, and others not only offered lower fares by themselves, they also added
252660	256300	market pressure that pushed down airfares industry-wide.
256300	260140	Traveling was now an approachable luxury, and destinations previously too far for a
260140	264620	practical vacation became the most intuitive options.
264620	268660	Decades on, budget airlines have thoroughly taken over travel across Europe.
268660	273580	They grew out of connecting the north of Europe to its south, but today go east, west, and
273580	275100	everywhere in between.
275100	278100	Meanwhile, however, trains.
278100	282780	The same oil crisis that stunted the growth of international vacationing in the 70s accelerated
282780	285220	the development of high-speed rail.
285220	289240	Facing a similar resource scarcity decades before, Japan captured the world's attention
289240	293900	by opening the first electric, high-speed rail service between Tokyo and Osaka, the
293900	295340	Shinkansen.
295340	299360	Embarrassed by being beaten to the punch, major economies globally started developing
299360	301820	their own plans for electric high-speed rail.
301820	306740	While the US, UK, Italy, and others made marginal progress in speeding up their trains, the
306740	311020	first to properly match the Shinkansen's speeds was France.
311020	316580	On September 22nd, 1981, France's Line à Grand Vitesse-Soudest opened for passenger
316580	317580	service.
317580	321580	What was a three-hour and forty-minute trip between Paris and Lyon the day before now
321580	324700	took just two hours and forty minutes.
324700	329300	The engineering effort behind these smooth, gentle tracks was colossal—the construction
329300	335260	cost some $18.7 million per mile, or $11.6 million per kilometer.
335260	339260	But as the country's first and third largest cities, a first line between Paris and Lyon
339260	344460	made sense, especially since it also reduced travel time to Marseille, the second largest.
344460	348320	France continued developing this network in this intuitive manner, opening LJV at Lantique
348320	352820	in 1989 to speed up travel to Rennes, Nantes, and Bordeaux, then extending the line past
352820	354980	Lyon to speed up trips to Marseille.
354980	359340	The nation's most ambitious connection occurred next, with the opening of LJV-Nord, which
359340	363760	linked Paris to Calais—the start of the brand new Channel Tunnel to Britain.
363760	368860	Come 1994, just thirteen years after the continent's first high-speed train rolled out of the station,
368860	372700	it was now possible to take a two-hour trip under the ocean between two of the world's
372700	376420	most economically important cities, Paris and London.
376420	381400	This was momentous, but unfortunately still is momentous.
381400	385520	This is still the most notable example of two European countries collaborating to connect
385520	389220	to each other by high-speed rail—it's an exception to the norm.
389220	394080	You see, France's high-speed network developed from the inside out.
394080	398380	In order to justify the enormous upfront cost of these rail projects, the politicians behind
398380	402560	them focused on connecting the greatest number of French people to the greatest number of
402560	406680	other French people—not Germans, Italians, or Spaniards.
406680	410960	Germany did the same, as did Italy, Spain, and essentially every nation with high-speed
410960	412680	rail in Europe.
412680	415820	This phenomena is paralleled with the trains themselves.
415820	420200	With slower travel speeds and fewer constituents to appease, international destinations have
420200	424300	always been an afterthought to the state-owned operators that dominate the European railway
424300	425760	industry.
425760	430980	Things primarily serve as domestic transport in Europe—planes dominate the international
430980	432260	industry.
432260	436820	Perhaps beyond the maps and metrics, the case studies and figures, the best evidence of
436820	442000	the limitations of cross-border European rail travel is the fact that for decades, the EU
442000	444740	itself has been working to fix it.
444740	449300	Cutting against the grain of history since the 1990s, the EU has authored reports, drafted
449300	453720	directives, and passed regulations seeking to address the two fundamental shortcomings
453720	458440	of European rails—a lack of competition and a lack of cohesion.
458440	463340	Identifying the fact that only a measly 6% of travelers went by rail in 2001, the EU
463340	467860	bemoaned how a lack of modernization in management and infrastructure had resulted in more road
467860	471520	congestion, more bottlenecks, and more car crashes.
471520	474820	A series of partially effective laws followed.
474820	480620	Citing the fact that intra-EU rail travel remained at 6% in 2013, the EU again recognized
480620	484960	that rail had effectively stagnated on account of a lack of competition and standardization,
484960	487940	and decided something more needed to be done.
487940	492820	In 2016, the EU passed a series of directives and regulations collectively called the Fourth
492820	498280	European Rail Package—it was the most comprehensive rail legislation to date.
498280	502000	The fourth package is broken into two pillars—the technical and the market.
502000	506560	On the technical side, the process of disbanding nation-run monopolies took a major step forward
506560	510340	with the addition of more stringent monitoring and the announcement that public service contracts
510340	514220	would become subject to competitive tendering beginning in 2023.
514220	518120	The technical side, on the other hand, sought to simplify by expanding the European Union
518120	522880	Agency for Railways into a one-stop-shop for all vehicle registrations, litigation issues,
522880	524400	and safety certification.
524400	528200	Together, the bundle of legislation aimed to increase competition and cut away some
528200	530840	of the red tape holding back international rail routes.
530840	535340	While it was the fourth attempt, the package, along with the three prior, has effectively
535340	537600	cracked the market wide open.
537600	542440	Theoretically, any operator, public or private, can now operate passenger trains anywhere
542440	547720	within the European Union—for the first time in a long time, European rail strategy
547720	551220	is undergoing fundamental change.
551220	555960	To date, as the EU hoped, the most profound impact of the fourth package and its predecessors
555960	560860	is in the increased competition between the all-powerful incumbents, Deutsche Bahn, SNCAF,
560860	566420	Trinitalia, Renfe, and a new wave of scrappy startups and international subsidiaries.
566420	571700	In 2012, a fleet of stylish, brand new, high-speed trains appeared on recently liberalized Italian
571700	574140	rails connecting Naples to Milan.
574140	579380	The open-access private rail company, Italo, backed by a $1 billion investment, had purchased
579380	584700	25 French Alston AGV trainsets and started direct competition along the country's busiest,
584700	587620	most densely populated, long-distance route.
587620	592580	Offering slightly lower ticket prices, onboard WiFi, and streamlined, largely automated booking,
592580	598140	the private operator took the incumbent Trinitalia head-on, and the company took off.
598140	602740	Leasing access to the corridor and outsourcing maintenance and food service to minimize overhead,
602740	607820	the service proved viable, and in the years that followed, Italo expanded nationwide,
607820	609980	turning its first profit in 2015.
609980	614700	Yet, rather than siphoning away customers from Trinitalia, Italo's new service across
614700	618860	a critical domestic route unearthed a previously hidden demand.
618860	623400	From 2011 to 2018, while Trinitalia went from commanding all Italian high-speed traffic
623400	627780	to only three-fourths, the revenue pool had grown to such an extent that the company actually
627780	629660	gained business.
629660	633700	With competition upping offerings and lowering prices, more Italians were taking the high-speed
633700	635900	trains than ever before.
635900	640060	The loser wasn't Trinitalia, but rather the airlines, as the Rome to Milan air passenger
640060	643220	numbers halved and Ryanair gave up the route entirely.
643220	648460	Now, the Italo situation was unique in that it took on the incumbent provider directly,
648460	654380	offering a nearly identical route with nearly identical service on nearly identical trains.
654380	659180	In a 2016 study of competitive open-access rail providers previously and currently operating,
659180	664420	of the 34 such companies in Europe, only Italo was high-speed, while 12 offered low-cost,
664420	669140	low-quality services, and another 11 offered niche services like night trains and weekend
669140	670140	routings.
670140	675420	In other words, 23 of 34 companies sought to minimize direct competition while offering
675420	677940	something different than the incumbent.
677940	682500	Flixtrain, for example, entered the German rail scene in 2018 when it took over the Hamburg-Cologne
682500	685940	Express line without ever actually buying a single train.
685940	689460	Rather than put up major money to challenge Deutsche Bahn's high-speed trains directly,
689460	694020	Flixtrain instead opted to run older, renovated trains leased from Railpool and operated by
694020	698980	the Germany company IGE to offer an alternative and far cheaper service.
698980	700780	So far, it has worked.
700780	704740	The success of Flixtrain's daily service from Hamburg to Cologne, a route far cheaper
704740	708780	and only slightly slower than Deutsche Bahn's high-speed option, has emboldened the company
708780	713700	to expand across Germany, open a line in Sweden, and even offer its first international connection
713700	715220	to Switzerland.
715220	719140	Flixtrain might be unique in the fact that it owns no rolling stock, but its budget business
719140	725460	model is far from uncommon for the early days of what may well be an open-access revolution.
725460	729280	The closest precedent to what's happening now in the European railways industry is the
729280	734620	deregulation of the American and European aviation markets from the 1970s onward.
734620	738940	It was exactly that that opened the door for Ryanair, EasyJet, Southwest, and others to
738940	742980	grow into some of the world's largest and most influential airlines.
742980	747060	No longer did airlines have to charge the fares, fly the routes, and offer the service
747060	749300	that the government dictated.
749300	753900	Capitalizing on this precedent, S.N.S.A.F., France's national rail operator, knew exactly
753900	758980	what to do back in 2013 in anticipation of the continent's coming liberalization.
758980	763180	WeGo was founded with the intention to adapt the low-cost airline business model to the
763180	764180	rails.
764220	767960	It could only be bought online, rather at labor-intensive ticket counters.
767960	772700	Upcharges were abundant, with luggage and even the use of electric outlets costing extra.
772700	778220	Legroom was tighter, staffing was more limited, and daily train utilization was higher.
778220	783540	All around, the experience was worse, but like its airborne equivalent, this was a compromise
783540	787620	people were willing to make in exchange for its rock bottom prices.
787620	791200	While its full-service equivalent offers the 90-minute trip between Rennes and Paris for
791200	797760	no less than $36, WeGo sells the same route for as little as $16.
797760	802220	While S.N.S.A.F. always had the ability to undercut itself within France, WeGo was founded
802220	804960	with an eye towards the future we're now living through.
804960	809880	It was a test, and seemingly a successful one, but the ultimate ambitions of WeGo laid
809880	812320	well beyond its home country.
812320	817280	In 2020, when Spain opened up its lines for closely monitored competition, WeGo España
817280	822460	was ready, and in 2021, France's national rail operator started its first route entirely
822460	825820	within Spain—Barcelona to Madrid.
825820	830040	In quick succession, and in direct response to the success of WeGo in France, Spain's
830040	834840	national operator RENFE founded AVLO to also offer low-cost service between the two cities,
834840	839080	and a third competitor, ERIO, is also expected to commence operations on the route later
839080	840820	in 2022.
840820	844580	Including the incumbent full-service high-speed train operated by RENFE, that means this route
844580	849220	will see four different services competing head-to-head between the same cities—Barcelona
849220	852940	to Madrid is becoming the world's most competitive rail route.
852940	858180	A certain extent of this cost-differentiated head-to-head competition seemingly can work,
858180	863160	based on the experience of Italo in Italy, and based on the experience of budget airlines.
863160	867100	For example, on the London to Barcelona air route, British Airways and Iberia passenger
867100	871740	numbers stayed relatively consistent throughout the early 2000s, while nearly all of the growth
871740	875260	can be attributed to EasyJet and Ryanair entering the market.
875260	880220	The budget operators didn't only capture demand, they created it.
880220	885620	WeGo has observed something similar—of passengers surveyed shortly after launch, 50% indicated
885620	890380	they would have otherwise taken the full-service alternative, but crucially, 25% say they would
890380	896440	have taken the car, bus, or plane, and another 25% say they would have not traveled at all.
896440	900240	Given the parallels in this phenomenon, that means low-cost rail operators don't need
900240	904680	to work within the context of current demand—they don't need to compete head-to-head on the
904680	910000	continent's busiest routes like Barcelona to Madrid, Paris to Lyon, or Milan to Rome.
910000	913620	Because they're creating rail demand, they can create routes that previously could not
913620	917340	have profitably operated given lower passenger numbers.
917340	921480	This was how budget airlines took over the world—not through direct competition, but
921480	924080	through induced demand.
924080	928540	So continuing the parallels with budget airlines, what we'll likely see going forward is route
928540	932840	innovation, especially focused on appealing to leisure travelers.
932840	937240	The French Riviera is an extremely popular vacation spot, but the stretch from Caen to
937240	942600	the Italian border currently only sees long-distance service on major routes to major French cities.
942600	946920	However, a private low-cost rail operator could take a page out of Allegiant Airlines'
946920	947920	playbook, for example.
947920	952380	They're a US airline focused on connecting small towns to popular vacation spots like
952380	956500	Las Vegas and Florida through low-cost flights a few times a week.
956500	960080	This is centered on the principle that vacationers will schedule their trips around convenient
960080	963960	transport, unlike business travelers, to keep to their strict schedule—and the fact that
963960	967520	Allegiant has one of the world's highest airline profit margins proves this principle
967520	968520	true.
968520	972740	Similarly, one could imagine a private low-cost operator running a twice-weekly train starting
972740	977120	in the early morning from Campere and Brittany, stopping at small towns like Lorient, Vingt,
977120	980920	and Redon on its way to Rennes, and speeding down on the high-speed lines to Marseille
980920	985720	before dropping passengers off at all the small coastal towns up until the Italian border.
985740	989600	Customers would plan around this convenient transport, and the business model could prove
989600	991460	similarly profitable.
991460	995800	But given the weakness of cross-border rail travel in Europe currently, the biggest opportunity
995800	1000540	for new innovative private rail operators in Europe likely centers on long-distance
1000540	1002720	international connections.
1002720	1007220	One could imagine, for example, a vast network of direct trains from France, Belgium, the
1007220	1011820	Netherlands, and Germany to popular vacation spots to the south like Barcelona, Florence,
1011820	1012820	and Rome.
1012920	1019700	Of course, the barrier to this is travel time, especially relative to rail's airborne competitor.
1019700	1023200	Passengers do tolerate longer travel times in exchange for the convenience and comfort
1023200	1028200	of trains, but only to an extent—there's still the infrastructure problem.
1028200	1031880	With track development always having been intertwined with rail service development,
1031880	1035980	which itself has been focused on domestic service, those cross-border gaps in high-speed
1035980	1038060	rail still exist.
1038060	1041860	Getting to Barcelona, Florence, and Rome requires dealing with the inefficiency of the tracks
1041900	1044060	between them and the north.
1044060	1049060	This is where the liberalization of the rails deviates from the liberalization of the skies.
1049060	1052800	Planes only need airports, which exist effectively everywhere.
1052800	1056700	Trains need tracks, which require a level of upfront investment far above what most
1056700	1058840	private companies tolerate.
1058840	1062780	Operators can only induce demand where governments have decided to build tracks.
1062780	1067640	So, in order to fulfill their goal of usurping the aviation industry and unlocking the full
1067640	1072800	potential of the next era of rail development, Europe has to find a way to view infrastructure
1072800	1078800	from the continental scale, rather than a national one—it has to invest in connectivity.
1078800	1082380	But that next era has already started.
1082380	1087040	Relative to the aviation industry, Europe's rail industry is roughly here—somewhere
1087040	1091160	between 1980 and 2000, as deregulation took full force.
1091160	1096960	And of course, what happened next was this—the fastest 20 years of growth and innovation
1096960	1099380	the industry has ever seen.
1099380	1102520	This revolution is already starting on the rails.
1102520	1107800	What's left to decide now, by governments and innovators, is just how precedent-setting
1107800	1111840	the next 20 years of European train travel are going to be.
1111840	1118740	I've been waiting to announce this for a long time—Extremities is back.
1118740	1122440	The show about how and why the world's most remote settlements exist that so many of you
1122440	1127040	love so much is starting again next week with a fantastic first episode about one of
1127040	1131960	the most remote and fascinating pieces of American territory—Wake Island, a dash of
1131960	1135740	land in the middle of the Pacific that's briefly become a crucial refueling point for
1135740	1137800	aircraft crossing the ocean.
1137800	1141660	The world's wealthiest individuals once landed on Wake on Pan Am Clippers to spend
1141660	1146080	a night in a luxury hotel before continuing their journeys, but today just a skeleton
1146080	1150880	crew from the US Air Force maintains the airfield in case its proximity to Asia becomes militarily
1150880	1151880	strategic again.
1151880	1156040	To be honest, we had a tough time making the economics of this rather high-budget show
1156040	1161480	work on YouTube, but luckily, Nebula and CuriosityStream have joined forces to bring it back as an
1161480	1165500	exclusive monthly series on both streaming sites.
1165500	1170120	Next Thursday, August 4th, episode 1 releases on both platforms, and then monthly after
1170120	1174040	that we'll release episodes about the world's most remote settlement, Tristan da Cunha,
1174040	1179000	the world's northernmost inhabited place, Ellesmere Island, and plenty more of the world's
1179000	1180000	extremities.
1180120	1183800	What makes this possible is the tens of thousands of you that have signed up for the Nebula
1183800	1188560	CuriosityStream bundle deal—the deal that I'm confident in saying is the best in streaming.
