00:00.000 --> 00:03.800
When the world thinks of Europe, they think of the trains.

00:03.800 --> 00:08.120
No continent's countries have so collectively chosen to develop such dense and efficient

00:08.120 --> 00:10.200
networks of passenger railways.

00:10.200 --> 00:14.520
One can step on a train above the Arctic Circle in Narvik, Norway, travel exclusively on the

00:14.520 --> 00:18.120
rails, and end up all the way at the continent's border with Asia and Istanbul.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.920
But it's not going to be efficient.

00:19.920 --> 00:24.280
That's because, while possible, this routing touches on the network's fatal flaw.

00:24.280 --> 00:28.040
France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and others have each developed some of the world's

00:28.040 --> 00:33.720
most efficient and effective rail networks, but they're just not well connected.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.880
Take Milan, for example, Europe's eighth largest metro area.

00:36.880 --> 00:40.960
While a world-leading network exists south to the rest of Italy and north into nearby

00:40.960 --> 00:46.160
Switzerland, just three trains go farther—a fairly frequent service to Paris, a once-daily

00:46.160 --> 00:49.800
trip to Frankfurt, and an overnight train to Munich and Vienna.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.400
This isn't an isolated edge case.

00:52.400 --> 00:56.460
Paris and Madrid are the European Union's two largest metro areas, and yet they have

00:56.460 --> 00:58.900
zero direct trains running between them.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.660
In fact, the farthest one can travel from France's borders on a direct high-speed

01:02.660 --> 01:07.020
train from Paris is London, Amsterdam, Munich, or Milan.

01:07.020 --> 01:12.660
And not only is there a dearth of direct trains, but connections are hardly straightforward.

01:12.660 --> 01:17.340
A Herculean effort went into digging a tunnel from France to the UK to connect the two countries'

01:17.340 --> 01:22.820
rail networks, and yet in practice, they connect London to the continent—not England, and

01:22.820 --> 01:25.020
certainly not the UK.

01:25.020 --> 01:28.720
Several constraints currently prevent practical cross-border passenger service beyond London,

01:28.720 --> 01:32.680
or by anyone but Eurostar, but the Eurostar service does little to integrate with the

01:32.680 --> 01:34.900
UK's existing domestic network.

01:34.900 --> 01:38.940
To travel from Paris to Manchester, for example, one must individually book the Eurostar from

01:38.940 --> 01:43.140
Paris to London, then upon arrival, walk 20 minutes from St. Pancras to Euston Station

01:43.140 --> 01:47.340
to take another train, which also must be booked individually, up to Manchester.

01:47.340 --> 01:51.040
The fact that this itinerary cannot be booked as a single ticket both means people are less

01:51.040 --> 01:54.720
likely to identify it as a possibility, and that if the first train is delayed enough

01:54.720 --> 01:58.800
that the second is missed, there's no obligation for the operator to rebook the traveler onto

01:58.800 --> 01:59.800
the next one.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.120
So, while only four hours of train travel stand between France's largest and the UK's

02:04.120 --> 02:08.620
second largest city, a competitive number versus air travel, these inefficiencies functionally

02:08.620 --> 02:11.800
increase it to an untenable level.

02:11.800 --> 02:16.480
The competitor, planes, also significantly undercut trains on fares.

02:16.480 --> 02:21.040
Unlike airlines, who price connecting itineraries lower than direct to compensate for the inconvenience,

02:21.040 --> 02:24.200
the fact that the two segments of this trip must be booked separately, and are therefore

02:24.200 --> 02:28.560
priced separately, makes this functionally impossible, even if it would be a winning

02:28.560 --> 02:29.800
strategy.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.800
One would be lucky to find a combination of train fares totaling $150 between Paris and

02:33.800 --> 02:38.640
Manchester, while airfares on this route typically sit below $100.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.780
This phenomena is consistent continent-wide.

02:41.780 --> 02:46.720
Average train fares between Paris and Barcelona typically sit three times higher than airfares.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.880
From Amsterdam to London, it's four times higher.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.180
Cases like Milan to Frankfurt do exist, where trains only cost marginally more, but that's

02:54.180 --> 02:55.280
not the average.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.640
In Europe, crossing borders by rail is more expensive and less convenient.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.220
This is no coincidence.

03:03.220 --> 03:06.860
The better part of a century ago, as Europe rebuilt and reconnected in the wake of World

03:06.860 --> 03:12.100
War II, countries across the continent searched for opportunities to revitalize their war-torn

03:12.100 --> 03:13.100
economies.

03:13.100 --> 03:16.940
A number of them, especially warm, southern nations like Spain and Italy, identified the

03:16.940 --> 03:19.140
potential of tourism.

03:19.140 --> 03:23.360
This conveniently coincided with the opening of the Jet Age, in which new aircraft development

03:23.360 --> 03:27.120
and economies of scale made air travel faster and more affordable.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.500
Packaged holiday providers took advantage of this to offer increasingly inexpensive

03:30.500 --> 03:35.140
trips to increasingly far-flung destinations, and some even went further to set up airlines

03:35.140 --> 03:39.680
entirely dedicated to flying vacationers like Condor and Britannia Airways.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.840
As travel abroad became affordable, cooler coastal towns closer to home, like England's

03:43.840 --> 03:48.180
Margate, Torquay, and Blackpool, started a slow slide into ruin.

03:48.180 --> 03:53.340
But simultaneously, to the south, tourist numbers exploded, as sunny seaside towns quickly

03:53.340 --> 03:56.000
developed into destinations.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.940
The oil crisis in the 70s stunted this growth, but it soon accelerated again in the 90s as

04:00.940 --> 04:05.580
the business model pioneered by Condor, Britannia, and others was refined and innovated upon.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.180
The budget airline was formed.

04:08.180 --> 04:12.660
Ryanair, EasyJet, and others not only offered lower fares by themselves, they also added

04:12.660 --> 04:16.300
market pressure that pushed down airfares industry-wide.

04:16.300 --> 04:20.140
Traveling was now an approachable luxury, and destinations previously too far for a

04:20.140 --> 04:24.620
practical vacation became the most intuitive options.

04:24.620 --> 04:28.660
Decades on, budget airlines have thoroughly taken over travel across Europe.

04:28.660 --> 04:33.580
They grew out of connecting the north of Europe to its south, but today go east, west, and

04:33.580 --> 04:35.100
everywhere in between.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.100
Meanwhile, however, trains.

04:38.100 --> 04:42.780
The same oil crisis that stunted the growth of international vacationing in the 70s accelerated

04:42.780 --> 04:45.220
the development of high-speed rail.

04:45.220 --> 04:49.240
Facing a similar resource scarcity decades before, Japan captured the world's attention

04:49.240 --> 04:53.900
by opening the first electric, high-speed rail service between Tokyo and Osaka, the

04:53.900 --> 04:55.340
Shinkansen.

04:55.340 --> 04:59.360
Embarrassed by being beaten to the punch, major economies globally started developing

04:59.360 --> 05:01.820
their own plans for electric high-speed rail.

05:01.820 --> 05:06.740
While the US, UK, Italy, and others made marginal progress in speeding up their trains, the

05:06.740 --> 05:11.020
first to properly match the Shinkansen's speeds was France.

05:11.020 --> 05:16.580
On September 22nd, 1981, France's Line à Grand Vitesse-Soudest opened for passenger

05:16.580 --> 05:17.580
service.

05:17.580 --> 05:21.580
What was a three-hour and forty-minute trip between Paris and Lyon the day before now

05:21.580 --> 05:24.700
took just two hours and forty minutes.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.300
The engineering effort behind these smooth, gentle tracks was colossal—the construction

05:29.300 --> 05:35.260
cost some $18.7 million per mile, or $11.6 million per kilometer.

05:35.260 --> 05:39.260
But as the country's first and third largest cities, a first line between Paris and Lyon

05:39.260 --> 05:44.460
made sense, especially since it also reduced travel time to Marseille, the second largest.

05:44.460 --> 05:48.320
France continued developing this network in this intuitive manner, opening LJV at Lantique

05:48.320 --> 05:52.820
in 1989 to speed up travel to Rennes, Nantes, and Bordeaux, then extending the line past

05:52.820 --> 05:54.980
Lyon to speed up trips to Marseille.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.340
The nation's most ambitious connection occurred next, with the opening of LJV-Nord, which

05:59.340 --> 06:03.760
linked Paris to Calais—the start of the brand new Channel Tunnel to Britain.

06:03.760 --> 06:08.860
Come 1994, just thirteen years after the continent's first high-speed train rolled out of the station,

06:08.860 --> 06:12.700
it was now possible to take a two-hour trip under the ocean between two of the world's

06:12.700 --> 06:16.420
most economically important cities, Paris and London.

06:16.420 --> 06:21.400
This was momentous, but unfortunately still is momentous.

06:21.400 --> 06:25.520
This is still the most notable example of two European countries collaborating to connect

06:25.520 --> 06:29.220
to each other by high-speed rail—it's an exception to the norm.

06:29.220 --> 06:34.080
You see, France's high-speed network developed from the inside out.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.380
In order to justify the enormous upfront cost of these rail projects, the politicians behind

06:38.380 --> 06:42.560
them focused on connecting the greatest number of French people to the greatest number of

06:42.560 --> 06:46.680
other French people—not Germans, Italians, or Spaniards.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.960
Germany did the same, as did Italy, Spain, and essentially every nation with high-speed

06:50.960 --> 06:52.680
rail in Europe.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.820
This phenomena is paralleled with the trains themselves.

06:55.820 --> 07:00.200
With slower travel speeds and fewer constituents to appease, international destinations have

07:00.200 --> 07:04.300
always been an afterthought to the state-owned operators that dominate the European railway

07:04.300 --> 07:05.760
industry.

07:05.760 --> 07:10.980
Things primarily serve as domestic transport in Europe—planes dominate the international

07:10.980 --> 07:12.260
industry.

07:12.260 --> 07:16.820
Perhaps beyond the maps and metrics, the case studies and figures, the best evidence of

07:16.820 --> 07:22.000
the limitations of cross-border European rail travel is the fact that for decades, the EU

07:22.000 --> 07:24.740
itself has been working to fix it.

07:24.740 --> 07:29.300
Cutting against the grain of history since the 1990s, the EU has authored reports, drafted

07:29.300 --> 07:33.720
directives, and passed regulations seeking to address the two fundamental shortcomings

07:33.720 --> 07:38.440
of European rails—a lack of competition and a lack of cohesion.

07:38.440 --> 07:43.340
Identifying the fact that only a measly 6% of travelers went by rail in 2001, the EU

07:43.340 --> 07:47.860
bemoaned how a lack of modernization in management and infrastructure had resulted in more road

07:47.860 --> 07:51.520
congestion, more bottlenecks, and more car crashes.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.820
A series of partially effective laws followed.

07:54.820 --> 08:00.620
Citing the fact that intra-EU rail travel remained at 6% in 2013, the EU again recognized

08:00.620 --> 08:04.960
that rail had effectively stagnated on account of a lack of competition and standardization,

08:04.960 --> 08:07.940
and decided something more needed to be done.

08:07.940 --> 08:12.820
In 2016, the EU passed a series of directives and regulations collectively called the Fourth

08:12.820 --> 08:18.280
European Rail Package—it was the most comprehensive rail legislation to date.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.000
The fourth package is broken into two pillars—the technical and the market.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.560
On the technical side, the process of disbanding nation-run monopolies took a major step forward

08:26.560 --> 08:30.340
with the addition of more stringent monitoring and the announcement that public service contracts

08:30.340 --> 08:34.220
would become subject to competitive tendering beginning in 2023.

08:34.220 --> 08:38.120
The technical side, on the other hand, sought to simplify by expanding the European Union

08:38.120 --> 08:42.880
Agency for Railways into a one-stop-shop for all vehicle registrations, litigation issues,

08:42.880 --> 08:44.400
and safety certification.

08:44.400 --> 08:48.200
Together, the bundle of legislation aimed to increase competition and cut away some

08:48.200 --> 08:50.840
of the red tape holding back international rail routes.

08:50.840 --> 08:55.340
While it was the fourth attempt, the package, along with the three prior, has effectively

08:55.340 --> 08:57.600
cracked the market wide open.

08:57.600 --> 09:02.440
Theoretically, any operator, public or private, can now operate passenger trains anywhere

09:02.440 --> 09:07.720
within the European Union—for the first time in a long time, European rail strategy

09:07.720 --> 09:11.220
is undergoing fundamental change.

09:11.220 --> 09:15.960
To date, as the EU hoped, the most profound impact of the fourth package and its predecessors

09:15.960 --> 09:20.860
is in the increased competition between the all-powerful incumbents, Deutsche Bahn, SNCAF,

09:20.860 --> 09:26.420
Trinitalia, Renfe, and a new wave of scrappy startups and international subsidiaries.

09:26.420 --> 09:31.700
In 2012, a fleet of stylish, brand new, high-speed trains appeared on recently liberalized Italian

09:31.700 --> 09:34.140
rails connecting Naples to Milan.

09:34.140 --> 09:39.380
The open-access private rail company, Italo, backed by a $1 billion investment, had purchased

09:39.380 --> 09:44.700
25 French Alston AGV trainsets and started direct competition along the country's busiest,

09:44.700 --> 09:47.620
most densely populated, long-distance route.

09:47.620 --> 09:52.580
Offering slightly lower ticket prices, onboard WiFi, and streamlined, largely automated booking,

09:52.580 --> 09:58.140
the private operator took the incumbent Trinitalia head-on, and the company took off.

09:58.140 --> 10:02.740
Leasing access to the corridor and outsourcing maintenance and food service to minimize overhead,

10:02.740 --> 10:07.820
the service proved viable, and in the years that followed, Italo expanded nationwide,

10:07.820 --> 10:09.980
turning its first profit in 2015.

10:09.980 --> 10:14.700
Yet, rather than siphoning away customers from Trinitalia, Italo's new service across

10:14.700 --> 10:18.860
a critical domestic route unearthed a previously hidden demand.

10:18.860 --> 10:23.400
From 2011 to 2018, while Trinitalia went from commanding all Italian high-speed traffic

10:23.400 --> 10:27.780
to only three-fourths, the revenue pool had grown to such an extent that the company actually

10:27.780 --> 10:29.660
gained business.

10:29.660 --> 10:33.700
With competition upping offerings and lowering prices, more Italians were taking the high-speed

10:33.700 --> 10:35.900
trains than ever before.

10:35.900 --> 10:40.060
The loser wasn't Trinitalia, but rather the airlines, as the Rome to Milan air passenger

10:40.060 --> 10:43.220
numbers halved and Ryanair gave up the route entirely.

10:43.220 --> 10:48.460
Now, the Italo situation was unique in that it took on the incumbent provider directly,

10:48.460 --> 10:54.380
offering a nearly identical route with nearly identical service on nearly identical trains.

10:54.380 --> 10:59.180
In a 2016 study of competitive open-access rail providers previously and currently operating,

10:59.180 --> 11:04.420
of the 34 such companies in Europe, only Italo was high-speed, while 12 offered low-cost,

11:04.420 --> 11:09.140
low-quality services, and another 11 offered niche services like night trains and weekend

11:09.140 --> 11:10.140
routings.

11:10.140 --> 11:15.420
In other words, 23 of 34 companies sought to minimize direct competition while offering

11:15.420 --> 11:17.940
something different than the incumbent.

11:17.940 --> 11:22.500
Flixtrain, for example, entered the German rail scene in 2018 when it took over the Hamburg-Cologne

11:22.500 --> 11:25.940
Express line without ever actually buying a single train.

11:25.940 --> 11:29.460
Rather than put up major money to challenge Deutsche Bahn's high-speed trains directly,

11:29.460 --> 11:34.020
Flixtrain instead opted to run older, renovated trains leased from Railpool and operated by

11:34.020 --> 11:38.980
the Germany company IGE to offer an alternative and far cheaper service.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.780
So far, it has worked.

11:40.780 --> 11:44.740
The success of Flixtrain's daily service from Hamburg to Cologne, a route far cheaper

11:44.740 --> 11:48.780
and only slightly slower than Deutsche Bahn's high-speed option, has emboldened the company

11:48.780 --> 11:53.700
to expand across Germany, open a line in Sweden, and even offer its first international connection

11:53.700 --> 11:55.220
to Switzerland.

11:55.220 --> 11:59.140
Flixtrain might be unique in the fact that it owns no rolling stock, but its budget business

11:59.140 --> 12:05.460
model is far from uncommon for the early days of what may well be an open-access revolution.

12:05.460 --> 12:09.280
The closest precedent to what's happening now in the European railways industry is the

12:09.280 --> 12:14.620
deregulation of the American and European aviation markets from the 1970s onward.

12:14.620 --> 12:18.940
It was exactly that that opened the door for Ryanair, EasyJet, Southwest, and others to

12:18.940 --> 12:22.980
grow into some of the world's largest and most influential airlines.

12:22.980 --> 12:27.060
No longer did airlines have to charge the fares, fly the routes, and offer the service

12:27.060 --> 12:29.300
that the government dictated.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.900
Capitalizing on this precedent, S.N.S.A.F., France's national rail operator, knew exactly

12:33.900 --> 12:38.980
what to do back in 2013 in anticipation of the continent's coming liberalization.

12:38.980 --> 12:43.180
WeGo was founded with the intention to adapt the low-cost airline business model to the

12:43.180 --> 12:44.180
rails.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.960
It could only be bought online, rather at labor-intensive ticket counters.

12:47.960 --> 12:52.700
Upcharges were abundant, with luggage and even the use of electric outlets costing extra.

12:52.700 --> 12:58.220
Legroom was tighter, staffing was more limited, and daily train utilization was higher.

12:58.220 --> 13:03.540
All around, the experience was worse, but like its airborne equivalent, this was a compromise

13:03.540 --> 13:07.620
people were willing to make in exchange for its rock bottom prices.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.200
While its full-service equivalent offers the 90-minute trip between Rennes and Paris for

13:11.200 --> 13:17.760
no less than $36, WeGo sells the same route for as little as $16.

13:17.760 --> 13:22.220
While S.N.S.A.F. always had the ability to undercut itself within France, WeGo was founded

13:22.220 --> 13:24.960
with an eye towards the future we're now living through.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.880
It was a test, and seemingly a successful one, but the ultimate ambitions of WeGo laid

13:29.880 --> 13:32.320
well beyond its home country.

13:32.320 --> 13:37.280
In 2020, when Spain opened up its lines for closely monitored competition, WeGo España

13:37.280 --> 13:42.460
was ready, and in 2021, France's national rail operator started its first route entirely

13:42.460 --> 13:45.820
within Spain—Barcelona to Madrid.

13:45.820 --> 13:50.040
In quick succession, and in direct response to the success of WeGo in France, Spain's

13:50.040 --> 13:54.840
national operator RENFE founded AVLO to also offer low-cost service between the two cities,

13:54.840 --> 13:59.080
and a third competitor, ERIO, is also expected to commence operations on the route later

13:59.080 --> 14:00.820
in 2022.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.580
Including the incumbent full-service high-speed train operated by RENFE, that means this route

14:04.580 --> 14:09.220
will see four different services competing head-to-head between the same cities—Barcelona

14:09.220 --> 14:12.940
to Madrid is becoming the world's most competitive rail route.

14:12.940 --> 14:18.180
A certain extent of this cost-differentiated head-to-head competition seemingly can work,

14:18.180 --> 14:23.160
based on the experience of Italo in Italy, and based on the experience of budget airlines.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.100
For example, on the London to Barcelona air route, British Airways and Iberia passenger

14:27.100 --> 14:31.740
numbers stayed relatively consistent throughout the early 2000s, while nearly all of the growth

14:31.740 --> 14:35.260
can be attributed to EasyJet and Ryanair entering the market.

14:35.260 --> 14:40.220
The budget operators didn't only capture demand, they created it.

14:40.220 --> 14:45.620
WeGo has observed something similar—of passengers surveyed shortly after launch, 50% indicated

14:45.620 --> 14:50.380
they would have otherwise taken the full-service alternative, but crucially, 25% say they would

14:50.380 --> 14:56.440
have taken the car, bus, or plane, and another 25% say they would have not traveled at all.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.240
Given the parallels in this phenomenon, that means low-cost rail operators don't need

15:00.240 --> 15:04.680
to work within the context of current demand—they don't need to compete head-to-head on the

15:04.680 --> 15:10.000
continent's busiest routes like Barcelona to Madrid, Paris to Lyon, or Milan to Rome.

15:10.000 --> 15:13.620
Because they're creating rail demand, they can create routes that previously could not

15:13.620 --> 15:17.340
have profitably operated given lower passenger numbers.

15:17.340 --> 15:21.480
This was how budget airlines took over the world—not through direct competition, but

15:21.480 --> 15:24.080
through induced demand.

15:24.080 --> 15:28.540
So continuing the parallels with budget airlines, what we'll likely see going forward is route

15:28.540 --> 15:32.840
innovation, especially focused on appealing to leisure travelers.

15:32.840 --> 15:37.240
The French Riviera is an extremely popular vacation spot, but the stretch from Caen to

15:37.240 --> 15:42.600
the Italian border currently only sees long-distance service on major routes to major French cities.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.920
However, a private low-cost rail operator could take a page out of Allegiant Airlines'

15:46.920 --> 15:47.920
playbook, for example.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.380
They're a US airline focused on connecting small towns to popular vacation spots like

15:52.380 --> 15:56.500
Las Vegas and Florida through low-cost flights a few times a week.

15:56.500 --> 16:00.080
This is centered on the principle that vacationers will schedule their trips around convenient

16:00.080 --> 16:03.960
transport, unlike business travelers, to keep to their strict schedule—and the fact that

16:03.960 --> 16:07.520
Allegiant has one of the world's highest airline profit margins proves this principle

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
true.

16:08.520 --> 16:12.740
Similarly, one could imagine a private low-cost operator running a twice-weekly train starting

16:12.740 --> 16:17.120
in the early morning from Campere and Brittany, stopping at small towns like Lorient, Vingt,

16:17.120 --> 16:20.920
and Redon on its way to Rennes, and speeding down on the high-speed lines to Marseille

16:20.920 --> 16:25.720
before dropping passengers off at all the small coastal towns up until the Italian border.

16:25.740 --> 16:29.600
Customers would plan around this convenient transport, and the business model could prove

16:29.600 --> 16:31.460
similarly profitable.

16:31.460 --> 16:35.800
But given the weakness of cross-border rail travel in Europe currently, the biggest opportunity

16:35.800 --> 16:40.540
for new innovative private rail operators in Europe likely centers on long-distance

16:40.540 --> 16:42.720
international connections.

16:42.720 --> 16:47.220
One could imagine, for example, a vast network of direct trains from France, Belgium, the

16:47.220 --> 16:51.820
Netherlands, and Germany to popular vacation spots to the south like Barcelona, Florence,

16:51.820 --> 16:52.820
and Rome.

16:52.920 --> 16:59.700
Of course, the barrier to this is travel time, especially relative to rail's airborne competitor.

16:59.700 --> 17:03.200
Passengers do tolerate longer travel times in exchange for the convenience and comfort

17:03.200 --> 17:08.200
of trains, but only to an extent—there's still the infrastructure problem.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.880
With track development always having been intertwined with rail service development,

17:11.880 --> 17:15.980
which itself has been focused on domestic service, those cross-border gaps in high-speed

17:15.980 --> 17:18.060
rail still exist.

17:18.060 --> 17:21.860
Getting to Barcelona, Florence, and Rome requires dealing with the inefficiency of the tracks

17:21.900 --> 17:24.060
between them and the north.

17:24.060 --> 17:29.060
This is where the liberalization of the rails deviates from the liberalization of the skies.

17:29.060 --> 17:32.800
Planes only need airports, which exist effectively everywhere.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.700
Trains need tracks, which require a level of upfront investment far above what most

17:36.700 --> 17:38.840
private companies tolerate.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.780
Operators can only induce demand where governments have decided to build tracks.

17:42.780 --> 17:47.640
So, in order to fulfill their goal of usurping the aviation industry and unlocking the full

17:47.640 --> 17:52.800
potential of the next era of rail development, Europe has to find a way to view infrastructure

17:52.800 --> 17:58.800
from the continental scale, rather than a national one—it has to invest in connectivity.

17:58.800 --> 18:02.380
But that next era has already started.

18:02.380 --> 18:07.040
Relative to the aviation industry, Europe's rail industry is roughly here—somewhere

18:07.040 --> 18:11.160
between 1980 and 2000, as deregulation took full force.

18:11.160 --> 18:16.960
And of course, what happened next was this—the fastest 20 years of growth and innovation

18:16.960 --> 18:19.380
the industry has ever seen.

18:19.380 --> 18:22.520
This revolution is already starting on the rails.

18:22.520 --> 18:27.800
What's left to decide now, by governments and innovators, is just how precedent-setting

18:27.800 --> 18:31.840
the next 20 years of European train travel are going to be.

18:31.840 --> 18:38.740
I've been waiting to announce this for a long time—Extremities is back.

18:38.740 --> 18:42.440
The show about how and why the world's most remote settlements exist that so many of you

18:42.440 --> 18:47.040
love so much is starting again next week with a fantastic first episode about one of

18:47.040 --> 18:51.960
the most remote and fascinating pieces of American territory—Wake Island, a dash of

18:51.960 --> 18:55.740
land in the middle of the Pacific that's briefly become a crucial refueling point for

18:55.740 --> 18:57.800
aircraft crossing the ocean.

18:57.800 --> 19:01.660
The world's wealthiest individuals once landed on Wake on Pan Am Clippers to spend

19:01.660 --> 19:06.080
a night in a luxury hotel before continuing their journeys, but today just a skeleton

19:06.080 --> 19:10.880
crew from the US Air Force maintains the airfield in case its proximity to Asia becomes militarily

19:10.880 --> 19:11.880
strategic again.

19:11.880 --> 19:16.040
To be honest, we had a tough time making the economics of this rather high-budget show

19:16.040 --> 19:21.480
work on YouTube, but luckily, Nebula and CuriosityStream have joined forces to bring it back as an

19:21.480 --> 19:25.500
exclusive monthly series on both streaming sites.

19:25.500 --> 19:30.120
