1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
When the world thinks of Europe, they think of the trains.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,120
No continent's countries have so collectively chosen to develop such dense and efficient

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:10,200
networks of passenger railways.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,520
One can step on a train above the Arctic Circle in Narvik, Norway, travel exclusively on the

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,120
rails, and end up all the way at the continent's border with Asia and Istanbul.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,920
But it's not going to be efficient.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,280
That's because, while possible, this routing touches on the network's fatal flaw.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,040
France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and others have each developed some of the world's

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,720
most efficient and effective rail networks, but they're just not well connected.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,880
Take Milan, for example, Europe's eighth largest metro area.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,960
While a world-leading network exists south to the rest of Italy and north into nearby

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,160
Switzerland, just three trains go farther—a fairly frequent service to Paris, a once-daily

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,800
trip to Frankfurt, and an overnight train to Munich and Vienna.

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,400
This isn't an isolated edge case.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,460
Paris and Madrid are the European Union's two largest metro areas, and yet they have

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,900
zero direct trains running between them.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,660
In fact, the farthest one can travel from France's borders on a direct high-speed

18
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,020
train from Paris is London, Amsterdam, Munich, or Milan.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,660
And not only is there a dearth of direct trains, but connections are hardly straightforward.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,340
A Herculean effort went into digging a tunnel from France to the UK to connect the two countries'

21
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,820
rail networks, and yet in practice, they connect London to the continent—not England, and

22
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,020
certainly not the UK.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,720
Several constraints currently prevent practical cross-border passenger service beyond London,

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,680
or by anyone but Eurostar, but the Eurostar service does little to integrate with the

25
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,900
UK's existing domestic network.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,940
To travel from Paris to Manchester, for example, one must individually book the Eurostar from

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,140
Paris to London, then upon arrival, walk 20 minutes from St. Pancras to Euston Station

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,340
to take another train, which also must be booked individually, up to Manchester.

29
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,040
The fact that this itinerary cannot be booked as a single ticket both means people are less

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,720
likely to identify it as a possibility, and that if the first train is delayed enough

31
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,800
that the second is missed, there's no obligation for the operator to rebook the traveler onto

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
the next one.

33
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,120
So, while only four hours of train travel stand between France's largest and the UK's

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,620
second largest city, a competitive number versus air travel, these inefficiencies functionally

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,800
increase it to an untenable level.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,480
The competitor, planes, also significantly undercut trains on fares.

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,040
Unlike airlines, who price connecting itineraries lower than direct to compensate for the inconvenience,

38
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,200
the fact that the two segments of this trip must be booked separately, and are therefore

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,560
priced separately, makes this functionally impossible, even if it would be a winning

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,800
strategy.

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,800
One would be lucky to find a combination of train fares totaling $150 between Paris and

42
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,640
Manchester, while airfares on this route typically sit below $100.

43
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,780
This phenomena is consistent continent-wide.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,720
Average train fares between Paris and Barcelona typically sit three times higher than airfares.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,880
From Amsterdam to London, it's four times higher.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,180
Cases like Milan to Frankfurt do exist, where trains only cost marginally more, but that's

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,280
not the average.

48
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,640
In Europe, crossing borders by rail is more expensive and less convenient.

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,220
This is no coincidence.

50
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,860
The better part of a century ago, as Europe rebuilt and reconnected in the wake of World

51
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,100
War II, countries across the continent searched for opportunities to revitalize their war-torn

52
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,100
economies.

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,940
A number of them, especially warm, southern nations like Spain and Italy, identified the

54
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,140
potential of tourism.

55
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,360
This conveniently coincided with the opening of the Jet Age, in which new aircraft development

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
and economies of scale made air travel faster and more affordable.

57
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,500
Packaged holiday providers took advantage of this to offer increasingly inexpensive

58
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,140
trips to increasingly far-flung destinations, and some even went further to set up airlines

59
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,680
entirely dedicated to flying vacationers like Condor and Britannia Airways.

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
As travel abroad became affordable, cooler coastal towns closer to home, like England's

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,180
Margate, Torquay, and Blackpool, started a slow slide into ruin.

62
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,340
But simultaneously, to the south, tourist numbers exploded, as sunny seaside towns quickly

63
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,000
developed into destinations.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,940
The oil crisis in the 70s stunted this growth, but it soon accelerated again in the 90s as

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,580
the business model pioneered by Condor, Britannia, and others was refined and innovated upon.

66
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,180
The budget airline was formed.

67
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,660
Ryanair, EasyJet, and others not only offered lower fares by themselves, they also added

68
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,300
market pressure that pushed down airfares industry-wide.

69
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,140
Traveling was now an approachable luxury, and destinations previously too far for a

70
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,620
practical vacation became the most intuitive options.

71
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,660
Decades on, budget airlines have thoroughly taken over travel across Europe.

72
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,580
They grew out of connecting the north of Europe to its south, but today go east, west, and

73
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,100
everywhere in between.

74
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,100
Meanwhile, however, trains.

75
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,780
The same oil crisis that stunted the growth of international vacationing in the 70s accelerated

76
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,220
the development of high-speed rail.

77
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,240
Facing a similar resource scarcity decades before, Japan captured the world's attention

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,900
by opening the first electric, high-speed rail service between Tokyo and Osaka, the

79
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,340
Shinkansen.

80
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,360
Embarrassed by being beaten to the punch, major economies globally started developing

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,820
their own plans for electric high-speed rail.

82
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,740
While the US, UK, Italy, and others made marginal progress in speeding up their trains, the

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,020
first to properly match the Shinkansen's speeds was France.

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,580
On September 22nd, 1981, France's Line à Grand Vitesse-Soudest opened for passenger

85
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
service.

86
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,580
What was a three-hour and forty-minute trip between Paris and Lyon the day before now

87
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,700
took just two hours and forty minutes.

88
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,300
The engineering effort behind these smooth, gentle tracks was colossal—the construction

89
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:35,260
cost some $18.7 million per mile, or $11.6 million per kilometer.

90
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,260
But as the country's first and third largest cities, a first line between Paris and Lyon

91
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,460
made sense, especially since it also reduced travel time to Marseille, the second largest.

92
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,320
France continued developing this network in this intuitive manner, opening LJV at Lantique

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,820
in 1989 to speed up travel to Rennes, Nantes, and Bordeaux, then extending the line past

94
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,980
Lyon to speed up trips to Marseille.

95
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,340
The nation's most ambitious connection occurred next, with the opening of LJV-Nord, which

96
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,760
linked Paris to Calais—the start of the brand new Channel Tunnel to Britain.

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,860
Come 1994, just thirteen years after the continent's first high-speed train rolled out of the station,

98
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,700
it was now possible to take a two-hour trip under the ocean between two of the world's

99
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,420
most economically important cities, Paris and London.

100
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:21,400
This was momentous, but unfortunately still is momentous.

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,520
This is still the most notable example of two European countries collaborating to connect

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,220
to each other by high-speed rail—it's an exception to the norm.

103
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,080
You see, France's high-speed network developed from the inside out.

104
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,380
In order to justify the enormous upfront cost of these rail projects, the politicians behind

105
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,560
them focused on connecting the greatest number of French people to the greatest number of

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,680
other French people—not Germans, Italians, or Spaniards.

107
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,960
Germany did the same, as did Italy, Spain, and essentially every nation with high-speed

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,680
rail in Europe.

109
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,820
This phenomena is paralleled with the trains themselves.

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,200
With slower travel speeds and fewer constituents to appease, international destinations have

111
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,300
always been an afterthought to the state-owned operators that dominate the European railway

112
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,760
industry.

113
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,980
Things primarily serve as domestic transport in Europe—planes dominate the international

114
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,260
industry.

115
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,820
Perhaps beyond the maps and metrics, the case studies and figures, the best evidence of

116
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,000
the limitations of cross-border European rail travel is the fact that for decades, the EU

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,740
itself has been working to fix it.

118
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,300
Cutting against the grain of history since the 1990s, the EU has authored reports, drafted

119
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,720
directives, and passed regulations seeking to address the two fundamental shortcomings

120
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,440
of European rails—a lack of competition and a lack of cohesion.

121
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,340
Identifying the fact that only a measly 6% of travelers went by rail in 2001, the EU

122
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,860
bemoaned how a lack of modernization in management and infrastructure had resulted in more road

123
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,520
congestion, more bottlenecks, and more car crashes.

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,820
A series of partially effective laws followed.

125
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,620
Citing the fact that intra-EU rail travel remained at 6% in 2013, the EU again recognized

126
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,960
that rail had effectively stagnated on account of a lack of competition and standardization,

127
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,940
and decided something more needed to be done.

128
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,820
In 2016, the EU passed a series of directives and regulations collectively called the Fourth

129
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,280
European Rail Package—it was the most comprehensive rail legislation to date.

130
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,000
The fourth package is broken into two pillars—the technical and the market.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,560
On the technical side, the process of disbanding nation-run monopolies took a major step forward

132
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,340
with the addition of more stringent monitoring and the announcement that public service contracts

133
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,220
would become subject to competitive tendering beginning in 2023.

134
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,120
The technical side, on the other hand, sought to simplify by expanding the European Union

135
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,880
Agency for Railways into a one-stop-shop for all vehicle registrations, litigation issues,

136
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,400
and safety certification.

137
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Together, the bundle of legislation aimed to increase competition and cut away some

138
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,840
of the red tape holding back international rail routes.

139
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:55,340
While it was the fourth attempt, the package, along with the three prior, has effectively

140
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,600
cracked the market wide open.

141
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,440
Theoretically, any operator, public or private, can now operate passenger trains anywhere

142
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,720
within the European Union—for the first time in a long time, European rail strategy

143
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,220
is undergoing fundamental change.

144
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,960
To date, as the EU hoped, the most profound impact of the fourth package and its predecessors

145
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,860
is in the increased competition between the all-powerful incumbents, Deutsche Bahn, SNCAF,

146
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,420
Trinitalia, Renfe, and a new wave of scrappy startups and international subsidiaries.

147
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,700
In 2012, a fleet of stylish, brand new, high-speed trains appeared on recently liberalized Italian

148
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,140
rails connecting Naples to Milan.

149
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,380
The open-access private rail company, Italo, backed by a $1 billion investment, had purchased

150
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,700
25 French Alston AGV trainsets and started direct competition along the country's busiest,

151
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,620
most densely populated, long-distance route.

152
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,580
Offering slightly lower ticket prices, onboard WiFi, and streamlined, largely automated booking,

153
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,140
the private operator took the incumbent Trinitalia head-on, and the company took off.

154
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,740
Leasing access to the corridor and outsourcing maintenance and food service to minimize overhead,

155
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,820
the service proved viable, and in the years that followed, Italo expanded nationwide,

156
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,980
turning its first profit in 2015.

157
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:14,700
Yet, rather than siphoning away customers from Trinitalia, Italo's new service across

158
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,860
a critical domestic route unearthed a previously hidden demand.

159
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,400
From 2011 to 2018, while Trinitalia went from commanding all Italian high-speed traffic

160
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,780
to only three-fourths, the revenue pool had grown to such an extent that the company actually

161
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,660
gained business.

162
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,700
With competition upping offerings and lowering prices, more Italians were taking the high-speed

163
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,900
trains than ever before.

164
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,060
The loser wasn't Trinitalia, but rather the airlines, as the Rome to Milan air passenger

165
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,220
numbers halved and Ryanair gave up the route entirely.

166
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,460
Now, the Italo situation was unique in that it took on the incumbent provider directly,

167
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,380
offering a nearly identical route with nearly identical service on nearly identical trains.

168
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,180
In a 2016 study of competitive open-access rail providers previously and currently operating,

169
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:04,420
of the 34 such companies in Europe, only Italo was high-speed, while 12 offered low-cost,

170
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,140
low-quality services, and another 11 offered niche services like night trains and weekend

171
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,140
routings.

172
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,420
In other words, 23 of 34 companies sought to minimize direct competition while offering

173
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,940
something different than the incumbent.

174
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,500
Flixtrain, for example, entered the German rail scene in 2018 when it took over the Hamburg-Cologne

175
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,940
Express line without ever actually buying a single train.

176
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,460
Rather than put up major money to challenge Deutsche Bahn's high-speed trains directly,

177
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,020
Flixtrain instead opted to run older, renovated trains leased from Railpool and operated by

178
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,980
the Germany company IGE to offer an alternative and far cheaper service.

179
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,780
So far, it has worked.

180
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,740
The success of Flixtrain's daily service from Hamburg to Cologne, a route far cheaper

181
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,780
and only slightly slower than Deutsche Bahn's high-speed option, has emboldened the company

182
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:53,700
to expand across Germany, open a line in Sweden, and even offer its first international connection

183
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,220
to Switzerland.

184
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,140
Flixtrain might be unique in the fact that it owns no rolling stock, but its budget business

185
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,460
model is far from uncommon for the early days of what may well be an open-access revolution.

186
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,280
The closest precedent to what's happening now in the European railways industry is the

187
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,620
deregulation of the American and European aviation markets from the 1970s onward.

188
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,940
It was exactly that that opened the door for Ryanair, EasyJet, Southwest, and others to

189
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,980
grow into some of the world's largest and most influential airlines.

190
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,060
No longer did airlines have to charge the fares, fly the routes, and offer the service

191
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,300
that the government dictated.

192
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,900
Capitalizing on this precedent, S.N.S.A.F., France's national rail operator, knew exactly

193
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,980
what to do back in 2013 in anticipation of the continent's coming liberalization.

194
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,180
WeGo was founded with the intention to adapt the low-cost airline business model to the

195
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
rails.

196
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,960
It could only be bought online, rather at labor-intensive ticket counters.

197
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,700
Upcharges were abundant, with luggage and even the use of electric outlets costing extra.

198
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,220
Legroom was tighter, staffing was more limited, and daily train utilization was higher.

199
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,540
All around, the experience was worse, but like its airborne equivalent, this was a compromise

200
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:07,620
people were willing to make in exchange for its rock bottom prices.

201
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,200
While its full-service equivalent offers the 90-minute trip between Rennes and Paris for

202
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,760
no less than $36, WeGo sells the same route for as little as $16.

203
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,220
While S.N.S.A.F. always had the ability to undercut itself within France, WeGo was founded

204
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,960
with an eye towards the future we're now living through.

205
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,880
It was a test, and seemingly a successful one, but the ultimate ambitions of WeGo laid

206
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,320
well beyond its home country.

207
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,280
In 2020, when Spain opened up its lines for closely monitored competition, WeGo España

208
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,460
was ready, and in 2021, France's national rail operator started its first route entirely

209
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,820
within Spain—Barcelona to Madrid.

210
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,040
In quick succession, and in direct response to the success of WeGo in France, Spain's

211
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,840
national operator RENFE founded AVLO to also offer low-cost service between the two cities,

212
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,080
and a third competitor, ERIO, is also expected to commence operations on the route later

213
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,820
in 2022.

214
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,580
Including the incumbent full-service high-speed train operated by RENFE, that means this route

215
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,220
will see four different services competing head-to-head between the same cities—Barcelona

216
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,940
to Madrid is becoming the world's most competitive rail route.

217
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,180
A certain extent of this cost-differentiated head-to-head competition seemingly can work,

218
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:23,160
based on the experience of Italo in Italy, and based on the experience of budget airlines.

219
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,100
For example, on the London to Barcelona air route, British Airways and Iberia passenger

220
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,740
numbers stayed relatively consistent throughout the early 2000s, while nearly all of the growth

221
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,260
can be attributed to EasyJet and Ryanair entering the market.

222
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,220
The budget operators didn't only capture demand, they created it.

223
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,620
WeGo has observed something similar—of passengers surveyed shortly after launch, 50% indicated

224
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,380
they would have otherwise taken the full-service alternative, but crucially, 25% say they would

225
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,440
have taken the car, bus, or plane, and another 25% say they would have not traveled at all.

226
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,240
Given the parallels in this phenomenon, that means low-cost rail operators don't need

227
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,680
to work within the context of current demand—they don't need to compete head-to-head on the

228
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:10,000
continent's busiest routes like Barcelona to Madrid, Paris to Lyon, or Milan to Rome.

229
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,620
Because they're creating rail demand, they can create routes that previously could not

230
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,340
have profitably operated given lower passenger numbers.

231
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,480
This was how budget airlines took over the world—not through direct competition, but

232
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,080
through induced demand.

233
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,540
So continuing the parallels with budget airlines, what we'll likely see going forward is route

234
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,840
innovation, especially focused on appealing to leisure travelers.

235
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,240
The French Riviera is an extremely popular vacation spot, but the stretch from Caen to

236
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,600
the Italian border currently only sees long-distance service on major routes to major French cities.

237
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,920
However, a private low-cost rail operator could take a page out of Allegiant Airlines'

238
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,920
playbook, for example.

239
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,380
They're a US airline focused on connecting small towns to popular vacation spots like

240
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,500
Las Vegas and Florida through low-cost flights a few times a week.

241
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,080
This is centered on the principle that vacationers will schedule their trips around convenient

242
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,960
transport, unlike business travelers, to keep to their strict schedule—and the fact that

243
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,520
Allegiant has one of the world's highest airline profit margins proves this principle

244
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
true.

245
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,740
Similarly, one could imagine a private low-cost operator running a twice-weekly train starting

246
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,120
in the early morning from Campere and Brittany, stopping at small towns like Lorient, Vingt,

247
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,920
and Redon on its way to Rennes, and speeding down on the high-speed lines to Marseille

248
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,720
before dropping passengers off at all the small coastal towns up until the Italian border.

249
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,600
Customers would plan around this convenient transport, and the business model could prove

250
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,460
similarly profitable.

251
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,800
But given the weakness of cross-border rail travel in Europe currently, the biggest opportunity

252
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,540
for new innovative private rail operators in Europe likely centers on long-distance

253
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,720
international connections.

254
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,220
One could imagine, for example, a vast network of direct trains from France, Belgium, the

255
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,820
Netherlands, and Germany to popular vacation spots to the south like Barcelona, Florence,

256
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,820
and Rome.

257
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,700
Of course, the barrier to this is travel time, especially relative to rail's airborne competitor.

258
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,200
Passengers do tolerate longer travel times in exchange for the convenience and comfort

259
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,200
of trains, but only to an extent—there's still the infrastructure problem.

260
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,880
With track development always having been intertwined with rail service development,

261
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,980
which itself has been focused on domestic service, those cross-border gaps in high-speed

262
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,060
rail still exist.

263
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,860
Getting to Barcelona, Florence, and Rome requires dealing with the inefficiency of the tracks

264
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,060
between them and the north.

265
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,060
This is where the liberalization of the rails deviates from the liberalization of the skies.

266
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,800
Planes only need airports, which exist effectively everywhere.

267
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,700
Trains need tracks, which require a level of upfront investment far above what most

268
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,840
private companies tolerate.

269
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,780
Operators can only induce demand where governments have decided to build tracks.

270
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,640
So, in order to fulfill their goal of usurping the aviation industry and unlocking the full

271
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,800
potential of the next era of rail development, Europe has to find a way to view infrastructure

272
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:58,800
from the continental scale, rather than a national one—it has to invest in connectivity.

273
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,380
But that next era has already started.

274
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,040
Relative to the aviation industry, Europe's rail industry is roughly here—somewhere

275
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,160
between 1980 and 2000, as deregulation took full force.

276
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,960
And of course, what happened next was this—the fastest 20 years of growth and innovation

277
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,380
the industry has ever seen.

278
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,520
This revolution is already starting on the rails.

279
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,800
What's left to decide now, by governments and innovators, is just how precedent-setting

280
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,840
the next 20 years of European train travel are going to be.

281
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,740
I've been waiting to announce this for a long time—Extremities is back.

282
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,440
The show about how and why the world's most remote settlements exist that so many of you

283
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:47,040
love so much is starting again next week with a fantastic first episode about one of

284
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,960
the most remote and fascinating pieces of American territory—Wake Island, a dash of

285
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,740
land in the middle of the Pacific that's briefly become a crucial refueling point for

286
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,800
aircraft crossing the ocean.

287
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,660
The world's wealthiest individuals once landed on Wake on Pan Am Clippers to spend

288
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,080
a night in a luxury hotel before continuing their journeys, but today just a skeleton

289
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,880
crew from the US Air Force maintains the airfield in case its proximity to Asia becomes militarily

290
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
strategic again.

291
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,040
To be honest, we had a tough time making the economics of this rather high-budget show

292
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,480
work on YouTube, but luckily, Nebula and CuriosityStream have joined forces to bring it back as an

293
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,500
exclusive monthly series on both streaming sites.

294
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,120
Next Thursday, August 4th, episode 1 releases on both platforms, and then monthly after

295
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,040
that we'll release episodes about the world's most remote settlement, Tristan da Cunha,

296
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,000
the world's northernmost inhabited place, Ellesmere Island, and plenty more of the world's

297
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
extremities.
