1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Australia is a nation defined by starkness.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,420
Evoking images of the New World, and mirroring the process of Western expansion, European

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,240
settlers arrived on an untamed continent, pushed across vast wilderness, through hostile

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,620
indigenous populations, and established, then doggedly defended, a few narrow bands of civilization.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,500
As the years rolled forward, cascading sequences of gold rushes and increasing need for agricultural

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,520
output pulled Australian society further from the convenient natural harbors where

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,820
it began.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,220
With Man and Beast continuously working to reclaim the land they usurped, the increasingly

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,680
small and informal groups of settlers on the frontier relied on their more advanced weaponry

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,020
to maintain their foothold.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,460
Guns matured into a standard-issue piece of kit for those straying beyond the established

12
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,460
towns.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,620
A century on, that reality remained.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,300
20th century Australians continued to leave the comfortable confines of coastal cities

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,240
in hope of transforming rural land into a living.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,540
Those that found themselves in this less urban life, in turn, inherited a unique culture

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,300
and identity framed around individualism and rugged self-reliance.

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,720
These individuals were proud of their lifestyle, providing for their families and nation through

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,020
what they helped pull from the earth.

20
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,100
Yet, even as technology advanced, nature proved unruly, and so rural Australians continued

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,980
to rely on their weaponry to defend their crops or livestock or minerals from the other.

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,340
Among this population, guns had become conflated with culture—they were important tools,

23
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,300
they were pest control, they were family heirlooms, they were security.

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,620
But as urban Australia continued to develop alongside rural Australia, guns in cities

25
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,720
and suburbs began to seem superfluous.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,160
Guns no longer worth the inherent risk of operating, and in untrained or uncertain hands,

27
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,280
potential disasters.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,480
All the while, as this rift widened, the weapons grew more effective.

29
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,040
The destructive potential of a minute shrunk down to a second.

30
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,920
What was once but a cultural difference morphed into an issue—should personal gun ownership

31
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,260
be allowed?

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,380
Was the necessity of some stronger than the risk to most, as the potential for misuse

33
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,540
grew in step with technological development?

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,100
As the century progressed, as the cosmopolitan and countryside continued to drift apart,

35
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,780
the issue escalated, and the questions informing the issue begged for an answer.

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,300
Australia's gun debate—informed by history, landscape, and legacy, intensified by growing

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,440
urban-rural divide and the technology's ruthless efficiency—was at an impasse.

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,000
As one exasperated New South Wales politician voiced after a futile national gun summit

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,720
in 1987, quote,

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,060
It will take a massacre in Tasmania before we get gun reform in Australia.

41
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,440
Nearly a decade later, his words proved prophetic.

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,720
It was just after one in the afternoon, on the 28th of April, 1996, when a 28-year-old

43
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,960
man in a yellow Volvo entered the Port Arthur Historic Site.

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,100
Carrying what security described as a sports-type bag through the tourist-laden formal penal

45
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:17,460
colony, the man entered a busy café, ate a meal, then opened fire on unsuspecting tourists.

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,140
Within just 90 seconds, the gunman had killed 20 people with 29 bullets.

47
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,900
Leaving the café, the shooting then continued onto the streets.

48
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,100
By the time of his capture the following day, the gunman had killed 35 and injured another

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,340
23.

50
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,940
In the hands of the murderer throughout his rampage was a semi-automatic Colt AR-15—a

51
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,620
weapon that, under Tasmania's uniquely hands-off gun laws, was available for purchase

52
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,980
without a license.

53
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,320
All told, it was the worst mass shooting in the nation's history, and while perpetrated

54
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:57,260
in a far corner of the country, the sheer depravity rocked Australia to its core.

55
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,700
For a moment, the shocked nation stammered.

56
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Then it began to move.

57
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:07,460
When the Port Arthur shooting was Australia's largest, it was far from the country's first.

58
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,060
The Hoddle Street killings and the Queen Street massacre, just months apart in Melbourne

59
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:16,760
in 1987, had set the backdrop for that year's ultimately fruitless national gun summit.

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,380
The gun violence continued into the new decade too, with one or more shootings in 1990, 1991,

61
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,020
1992, and 1993.

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,100
In ten years, Australia experienced 12 mass shootings, abruptly ending the lives of 98

63
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,100
people.

64
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
While gun ownership was common across the nation's history, the increase in mass shootings

65
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,720
and the high firearm death rate of 2.84 per 100,000 people, well above England's rate

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,560
of 0.42 per 100,000, were becoming too much for most Australians to bear.

67
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,900
By 1996, punctuated by the most horrific shooting of them all, Australians had had enough.

68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:02,460
In a poll run days after the Port Arthur massacre, 90% of the 2,058 respondents supported a national

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,340
ban on automatic and semi-automatic firearms, and 88% supported registration requirements

70
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,260
for all firearms.

71
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,840
Simply put, average, everyday Australians were ready for change.

72
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,040
But popular public attitudes won't move policy alone—a fundamental restructuring

73
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,500
of Australian gun laws was anything but a foregone conclusion in the wake of Port Arthur.

74
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,840
Any attempt at sweeping change would have to navigate around the country's powerful

75
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,800
gun lobby, a vocal and impassioned minority of rural Australians wary of government overreach,

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,700
and the fact that gun policy was governed not by the federal government, but by states.

77
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,120
And yet, the day after the shooting, John Howard, Australia's Prime Minister for all

78
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,520
of 48 days, announced his effort to push through major gun law reform.

79
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,180
Howard and his coalition government had ample room to cop out—to throw their hands up

80
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,160
and say it was a state-level issue.

81
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,580
Instead, they pushed on.

82
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,620
As he later reflected, quote, you never let a good crisis go to waste.

83
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:06,700
Tragic though the event was, it gave us an opportunity to do something in the wake of

84
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,900
it, so that those lives were not lost in vain.

85
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,020
In the days that followed, cabinet meetings poured over studies pulled together by non-governmental

86
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,200
groups like the Coalition for Gun Control, and previously, internally produced policy

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,380
recommendations that followed the Melbourne shootings.

88
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,320
Outside of cabinet meetings, Howard urged representatives from his coalition of Liberal

89
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,180
and National Party members to stand with him.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,700
But as Howard applied pressure on conservatives representing rural Australia, so too did the

91
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,740
nation's gun lobby, which organized marches, street demonstrations, and speeches.

92
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,340
Ultimately, the lobby's mobilization proved detrimental to its own cause, as arguments

93
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,960
made in media that 99.9% of gun owners abide by the law, for example, gave way to high-profile

94
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,420
figures like the Vice President of the Firearm Owners Association threatening bloodshed if

95
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,820
stricter regulations went through.

96
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,900
In less than a week after the Port Arthur massacre, the political determination emanating

97
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,340
from Parliament had resulted in a cabinet agreement on a prohibition on automatic rifles,

98
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,040
semi-automatic rifles, and pump-action shotguns, the creation of a national firearm registration

99
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,580
system, and a compensation fund for a gun buyback program.

100
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,860
Four days later, on May 10th, the Prime Minister hosted the police ministers from all states

101
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,140
and territories to present the 10-point plan that soon informed the nation's first set

102
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,960
of universal gun laws—what would be known as the National Firearms Agreement.

103
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,780
Even with broad public support, the NFA was hard won.

104
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,140
Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia refused to agree to the NFA for

105
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,820
months and pushed for semi-automatics to remain legal as long as they were crimped, or modified

106
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,640
to carry limited rounds.

107
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,260
Only after Howard threatened to expand federal power did they join the nationwide program.

108
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,460
In some places, the NFA was bitterly resented.

109
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,300
During speaking tours intended to explain and promote the program, Deputy Prime Minister

110
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,540
Tim Fisher was burned in effigy in the Queensland state of Gympie, while Prime Minister Howard

111
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,280
donned a bulletproof vest when speaking in Sale, Victoria.

112
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,580
With all states and territories signed on by the middle of 1996, the agreement flipped

113
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,700
Australia's loose, decentralized gun laws—on their head.

114
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,300
What was once a system so scant that a law student reading through gun statues thought

115
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,320
there were pages missing, had suddenly become one of the world's most thorough.

116
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,640
Only a gun and gun sale now had to be recorded in a national registry.

117
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,920
Anyone who owned or sought to own a gun needed to prove they had a genuine reason—crucially,

118
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,540
in the eyes of Australian policymakers, self-defense was not one.

119
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,820
Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were now banned except for when a farmer or professional

120
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,220
shooter could prove genuine reason.

121
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,680
Gun owners now needed to be 18 or older, needed to pass a safety course, and had to abide

122
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,680
by strict gun storage rules.

123
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,420
And if in possession of a newly-prohibited gun, Australians now had 12 months to surrender

124
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,240
it and receive fair compensation, funded by a one-time Medicare levy.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,000
A year later, Australia had confiscated and destroyed 650,000 guns, and it did so under

126
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
budget as the project cost Australian taxpayers around $360 million.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,460
So… did it work?

128
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,640
Did the sweeping, disruptive reforms of the National Firearms Agreement actually save

129
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
lives?

130
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,080
Well, in the decade leading up to the Port Arthur Massacre, the country experienced 12

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:20,000
shootings with at least four fatal victims, totaling 98 individuals killed.

132
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,120
In the decade after the Port Arthur Massacre, Australia experienced none.

133
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,360
In fact, in the 26 years since, there have been only three mass shootings with a total

134
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,560
of 12 victims.

135
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Proponents point to this as the conclusive piece of evidence that Australia's gun restrictions

136
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:44,000
were a masterstroke of public policy—a single maneuver that solved a massive, deadly

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,880
problem.

138
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,320
But others are quick to point out that mass shootings are a relatively rare event.

139
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,420
Even during Australia's most notorious and deadly decade of shootings, they occurred

140
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,960
just over once a year.

141
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,740
While undoubtedly tragic on a human level, from a statistical standpoint, this frequency

142
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:06,960
instills relatively low confidence in any observed trend.

143
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,800
The confidence is lowered yet further when glancing back another decade—from 1976

144
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,320
to 1986, there were just two shootings with ten total victims.

145
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,000
So, was the ten years starting in 96th a deviation from the trend, or was it the ten years starting

146
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,960
in 86?

147
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,320
Especially in the context of mass shootings, where shooters get inspired by shooters who

148
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,920
get inspired by shooters, was there simply a spate of violence followed by a regression

149
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,240
to the mean?

150
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,120
To determine this, one can substitute this low-frequency statistic for a higher-frequency

151
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,040
equivalent—the more data points, the more one can be confident in causation over mere

152
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
correlation.

153
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,120
While the National Firearms Agreement was implemented in response to a mass shooting,

154
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,320
it was concurrently designed to address all types of gun violence.

155
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,760
So, Australia's overall firearm mortality rate can be used as a proxy metric in examining

156
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,840
the policy's effectiveness.

157
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,820
In 1996, the year of the Port Arthur Massacre, this rate sat at 2.84 gun deaths per year

158
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,440
per 100,000 people—today, it's just 0.9.

159
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,640
A threefold drop in less than three decades surely proves that gun control curbed gun

160
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,080
violence, but some are quick to respond that trends don't mean anything in isolation.

161
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,280
Glancing backwards, firearm fatality in Australia was already on the decline, and the drop from

162
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,040
2.84 was just a continuation of the drop from 4.7.

163
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,980
Prior to 1996, according to research led by gun policy expert Philipp Alpers, the rate

164
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,480
of decline was an average of 3% a year.

165
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Post-1996, however, it accelerated to 4.9—a meaningful, measurable, near-doubling in rate,

166
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,840
right after the most significant gun policy reform in decades.

167
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:57,260
Now, while certainly stronger, there are still potentially holes in this proof.

168
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,720
One could, and some have argued that this too could be random chance—that the rate

169
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,460
of decline had the option of staying the same, or decelerating, or accelerating post-1996,

170
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,560
and it just so happened that the third option occurred.

171
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,240
But there is yet another method of establishing causality—a method that has real-world,

172
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,560
practical evidence behind its effectiveness.

173
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,720
It's called rare-event predictive modeling.

174
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,220
You see, predictive modeling for common events is fairly straightforward—a streaming service

175
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,240
like Netflix, for example, will use troves of data to build out a model for how long

176
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,920
it expects a given customer to stick around based on factors like their age, home address,

177
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,360
gender, and more.

178
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,240
This model is useful, since, if the company learns that a given sign-up in Illinois, for

179
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,120
example, stays subscribed on average four months longer than a given customer from Massachusetts,

180
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,020
the company can afford to spend more marketing to those Illinois-based customers, since their

181
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,280
lifetime value is higher.

182
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,320
Netflix and others rely on the sheer quantity of data points to build out highly specific,

183
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,680
highly accurate models like this.

184
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,000
The rarer an event becomes, though, the tougher it is to build out an accurate, predictive

185
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
model.

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,920
But it's not impossible, and the reason why it's not impossible is because time

187
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,880
and money have been poured into developing and validating predictive models for rare

188
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,960
events thanks to the massive industry it makes possible—insurance.

189
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,360
How the insurance industry works is simple.

190
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:24,460
Individuals are way more afraid of having a 1 in 10,000 chance of having their home

191
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,840
robbed and having to spend $100,000 to replace things than having a 1 in 10 chance of breaking

192
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,320
their microwave and having to spend $100.

193
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,440
That's despite the fact that in either scenario, the average person is going to be out $10

194
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,600
either way.

195
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,560
$100,000 divided by $10,000 is $10, and so is $100 divided by $10.

196
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,200
While in isolation illogical, this bias is in reality pragmatic, since far more people

197
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,400
can weather a $100 expense than a $100,000 one without going into debt and financial

198
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
hardship.

199
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,880
Therefore, what insurance does is aggregate 10,000 people with that 1 in 10,000 chance

200
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,320
together and charge them each $10 so that the one of them that does get robbed doesn't

201
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
go into financial ruin.

202
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,080
Except, they don't really charge them $10—they charge them, say, $11 so that they can turn

203
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:15,360
a profit—but in order to do this, they need to determine what the likelihood of a given

204
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,240
individual getting robbed is.

205
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,560
And again, the events that insurance companies insure against are by their very nature rare

206
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,960
because those are the ones people are worried about.

207
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Therefore, insurers need to take in a miniscule number of data points and build a predictive

208
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,620
model based on them.

209
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,180
If they do it wrong and consider home robberies more common than reality, they'll overcharge

210
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,060
and a competitor will come in, undercut their prices, and capture all their customers.

211
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,680
If they consider it less likely than reality, they'll run out of money from paying out

212
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,720
more to robbed customers than they take in.

213
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,180
Without diving into the mind-numbing mathematics behind rare event predictive modeling, the

214
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,540
proof that it works is that the insurance industry exists.

215
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,500
The proof is that these companies can only make a profit if they've accurately predicted

216
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:07,140
the commonality of events as rare and unlikely as sinkholes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,

217
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,540
missile attacks, plane crashes, bear attacks, and more, damaging and destroying homes.

218
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,860
The same rare event predictive modeling techniques were applied in research led by Simon Chapman

219
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,720
of the University of Sydney's School of Public Health.

220
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,740
He and his co-researchers looked at the data on Australian shootings in the same way an

221
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,660
insurer would, and built a rare events predictive model that indicated between 1996 and 2018,

222
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,380
when the study was conducted, there should have been 16.3 mass shootings in the country,

223
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,280
with a minimum of 65 fatal victims.

224
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,940
In reality, there were just two.

225
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,220
Building on that baseline, the researchers were able to calculate the likelihood that

226
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,320
this trend could be explained simply by random chance—that the rarity of mass shootings

227
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,320
meant that their 22-year absence was merely a data anomaly.

228
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,580
The answer was one in two hundred thousand.

229
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,660
That's to say, there's a chance that the absence in mass shootings in Australia post-1996

230
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,260
was caused by the natural ebb and flow in their occurrence, but that chance is one in

231
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,540
two hundred thousand.

232
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:14,460
Meanwhile, there's a 199,999 in two hundred thousand chance that something other than

233
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,980
random chance is behind the trend—something like the implementation of the most significant

234
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,100
gun control measures in the country's history.

235
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,380
One can't ever outright, 100% prove a link between two separate occurrences in the real

236
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,380
world.

237
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:32,180
This is why people say that correlation does not imply causation.

238
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,460
If you asked a data scientist to prove that flipping your light switch light to your light

239
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,140
turning off, they'd tell you that there's a chance that the light was on a timer scheduled

240
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,220
to switch off at that moment regardless, or that there's a chance that the research

241
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,740
assistant tasked with collecting data about switch flips and light illumination was being

242
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,020
bribed to make them look more correlated than reality, or that there's a chance that the

243
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,300
light wasn't real in the first place and was just a hologram made to make you think

244
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,640
it was turning off in time with the switch.

245
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,980
These are all unlikely, but technically not impossible.

246
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,300
In a world of infinite possibility, one can always find another genuinely possible cause

247
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,060
for a given outcome.

248
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:11,740
The data scientists will always tell you there's a one-in-a-lot chance that something other

249
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,500
than flipping the switch led to the light turning off.

250
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,940
But probably not.

251
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,400
It probably wasn't any of that.

252
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,680
Flipping the light switch probably led to the light turning off.

253
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,520
In every way, it's tough to make videos about subjects with the weight and tragic

254
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,360
significance of this one.

255
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,480
From word choice and motion graphics to visuals, and a close reading of YouTube's content

256
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,040
guidelines, we have to put a lot of thought into how to cover and visualize this story.

257
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,920
Thankfully, we have our sponsor Storyblocks, who has allowed us to take this subject on

258
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,160
in the first place by sponsoring this tough-to-monetize video.

259
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,360
Long before they sponsored this channel, Storyblocks was quite literally the first place I turned

260
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,040
for stock footage—its footage is what the very first video on this channel is almost

261
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,760
entirely made up of—and because they're still built for small-scale, independent creators,

262
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,780
I still use Storyblocks for stock footage today.

263
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,320
With their unlimited subscription, you can use and download all the material you want

264
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,560
for less than what a single clip might run you at another stock footage provider.

265
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,260
Storyblocks offers way more than just stock footage, too—they also carry After Effects

266
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,700
and Premiere Pro templates, images, music, and sound effects.

267
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,260
No matter what you end up using from their demand-driven library, though, you won't

268
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,220
have to worry about royalties—Storyblocks is entirely royalty-free, meaning you can

269
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,660
use their stuff for any commercial or personal project without having to think about it down

270
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,660
the line.

271
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,860
I've used Storyblocks from the beginning, and I can tell you from personal experience

272
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,660
that it's been a crucial resource for this channel and channels like it.

273
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,460
If you're making videos already or want to become a creator, give Storyblocks a try.

274
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:45,500
Click the button on screen or head to Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be

275
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,940
