00:00.000 --> 00:04.740
Australia is a nation defined by starkness.

00:04.740 --> 00:09.420
Evoking images of the New World, and mirroring the process of Western expansion, European

00:09.420 --> 00:14.240
settlers arrived on an untamed continent, pushed across vast wilderness, through hostile

00:14.240 --> 00:21.620
indigenous populations, and established, then doggedly defended, a few narrow bands of civilization.

00:21.620 --> 00:26.500
As the years rolled forward, cascading sequences of gold rushes and increasing need for agricultural

00:26.500 --> 00:31.520
output pulled Australian society further from the convenient natural harbors where

00:31.520 --> 00:32.820
it began.

00:32.820 --> 00:37.220
With Man and Beast continuously working to reclaim the land they usurped, the increasingly

00:37.220 --> 00:41.680
small and informal groups of settlers on the frontier relied on their more advanced weaponry

00:41.680 --> 00:44.020
to maintain their foothold.

00:44.020 --> 00:48.460
Guns matured into a standard-issue piece of kit for those straying beyond the established

00:48.460 --> 00:49.460
towns.

00:49.460 --> 00:52.620
A century on, that reality remained.

00:53.060 --> 00:57.300
20th century Australians continued to leave the comfortable confines of coastal cities

00:57.300 --> 01:01.240
in hope of transforming rural land into a living.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.540
Those that found themselves in this less urban life, in turn, inherited a unique culture

01:05.540 --> 01:10.300
and identity framed around individualism and rugged self-reliance.

01:10.300 --> 01:14.720
These individuals were proud of their lifestyle, providing for their families and nation through

01:14.720 --> 01:17.020
what they helped pull from the earth.

01:17.060 --> 01:23.100
Yet, even as technology advanced, nature proved unruly, and so rural Australians continued

01:23.100 --> 01:28.980
to rely on their weaponry to defend their crops or livestock or minerals from the other.

01:28.980 --> 01:34.340
Among this population, guns had become conflated with culture—they were important tools,

01:34.340 --> 01:38.300
they were pest control, they were family heirlooms, they were security.

01:38.300 --> 01:42.620
But as urban Australia continued to develop alongside rural Australia, guns in cities

01:42.620 --> 01:45.720
and suburbs began to seem superfluous.

01:45.720 --> 01:51.160
Guns no longer worth the inherent risk of operating, and in untrained or uncertain hands,

01:51.160 --> 01:53.280
potential disasters.

01:53.280 --> 01:58.480
All the while, as this rift widened, the weapons grew more effective.

01:58.480 --> 02:03.040
The destructive potential of a minute shrunk down to a second.

02:03.040 --> 02:08.920
What was once but a cultural difference morphed into an issue—should personal gun ownership

02:08.920 --> 02:10.260
be allowed?

02:10.260 --> 02:14.380
Was the necessity of some stronger than the risk to most, as the potential for misuse

02:14.380 --> 02:17.540
grew in step with technological development?

02:17.540 --> 02:22.100
As the century progressed, as the cosmopolitan and countryside continued to drift apart,

02:22.100 --> 02:27.780
the issue escalated, and the questions informing the issue begged for an answer.

02:27.780 --> 02:33.300
Australia's gun debate—informed by history, landscape, and legacy, intensified by growing

02:33.300 --> 02:38.440
urban-rural divide and the technology's ruthless efficiency—was at an impasse.

02:38.440 --> 02:43.000
As one exasperated New South Wales politician voiced after a futile national gun summit

02:43.000 --> 02:44.720
in 1987, quote,

02:44.720 --> 02:50.060
It will take a massacre in Tasmania before we get gun reform in Australia.

02:50.060 --> 02:54.440
Nearly a decade later, his words proved prophetic.

02:54.440 --> 03:00.720
It was just after one in the afternoon, on the 28th of April, 1996, when a 28-year-old

03:00.720 --> 03:05.960
man in a yellow Volvo entered the Port Arthur Historic Site.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.100
Carrying what security described as a sports-type bag through the tourist-laden formal penal

03:10.100 --> 03:17.460
colony, the man entered a busy café, ate a meal, then opened fire on unsuspecting tourists.

03:17.460 --> 03:23.140
Within just 90 seconds, the gunman had killed 20 people with 29 bullets.

03:23.140 --> 03:26.900
Leaving the café, the shooting then continued onto the streets.

03:26.900 --> 03:32.100
By the time of his capture the following day, the gunman had killed 35 and injured another

03:32.100 --> 03:33.340
23.

03:33.340 --> 03:38.940
In the hands of the murderer throughout his rampage was a semi-automatic Colt AR-15—a

03:38.940 --> 03:43.620
weapon that, under Tasmania's uniquely hands-off gun laws, was available for purchase

03:43.620 --> 03:45.980
without a license.

03:45.980 --> 03:50.320
All told, it was the worst mass shooting in the nation's history, and while perpetrated

03:50.320 --> 03:57.260
in a far corner of the country, the sheer depravity rocked Australia to its core.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.700
For a moment, the shocked nation stammered.

04:00.700 --> 04:01.700
Then it began to move.

04:01.700 --> 04:07.460
When the Port Arthur shooting was Australia's largest, it was far from the country's first.

04:07.460 --> 04:11.060
The Hoddle Street killings and the Queen Street massacre, just months apart in Melbourne

04:11.060 --> 04:16.760
in 1987, had set the backdrop for that year's ultimately fruitless national gun summit.

04:16.760 --> 04:22.380
The gun violence continued into the new decade too, with one or more shootings in 1990, 1991,

04:22.380 --> 04:25.020
1992, and 1993.

04:25.020 --> 04:32.100
In ten years, Australia experienced 12 mass shootings, abruptly ending the lives of 98

04:32.100 --> 04:33.100
people.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.520
While gun ownership was common across the nation's history, the increase in mass shootings

04:37.520 --> 04:42.720
and the high firearm death rate of 2.84 per 100,000 people, well above England's rate

04:42.720 --> 04:48.560
of 0.42 per 100,000, were becoming too much for most Australians to bear.

04:48.560 --> 04:55.900
By 1996, punctuated by the most horrific shooting of them all, Australians had had enough.

04:55.900 --> 05:02.460
In a poll run days after the Port Arthur massacre, 90% of the 2,058 respondents supported a national

05:02.460 --> 05:08.340
ban on automatic and semi-automatic firearms, and 88% supported registration requirements

05:08.340 --> 05:10.260
for all firearms.

05:10.260 --> 05:15.840
Simply put, average, everyday Australians were ready for change.

05:15.840 --> 05:21.040
But popular public attitudes won't move policy alone—a fundamental restructuring

05:21.040 --> 05:26.500
of Australian gun laws was anything but a foregone conclusion in the wake of Port Arthur.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.840
Any attempt at sweeping change would have to navigate around the country's powerful

05:29.840 --> 05:34.800
gun lobby, a vocal and impassioned minority of rural Australians wary of government overreach,

05:34.800 --> 05:39.700
and the fact that gun policy was governed not by the federal government, but by states.

05:39.700 --> 05:44.120
And yet, the day after the shooting, John Howard, Australia's Prime Minister for all

05:44.120 --> 05:49.520
of 48 days, announced his effort to push through major gun law reform.

05:49.520 --> 05:54.180
Howard and his coalition government had ample room to cop out—to throw their hands up

05:54.180 --> 05:56.160
and say it was a state-level issue.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.580
Instead, they pushed on.

05:58.580 --> 06:02.620
As he later reflected, quote, you never let a good crisis go to waste.

06:02.620 --> 06:06.700
Tragic though the event was, it gave us an opportunity to do something in the wake of

06:06.700 --> 06:09.900
it, so that those lives were not lost in vain.

06:09.900 --> 06:14.020
In the days that followed, cabinet meetings poured over studies pulled together by non-governmental

06:14.020 --> 06:18.200
groups like the Coalition for Gun Control, and previously, internally produced policy

06:18.200 --> 06:21.380
recommendations that followed the Melbourne shootings.

06:21.380 --> 06:25.320
Outside of cabinet meetings, Howard urged representatives from his coalition of Liberal

06:25.320 --> 06:28.180
and National Party members to stand with him.

06:28.180 --> 06:32.700
But as Howard applied pressure on conservatives representing rural Australia, so too did the

06:32.700 --> 06:37.740
nation's gun lobby, which organized marches, street demonstrations, and speeches.

06:37.740 --> 06:42.340
Ultimately, the lobby's mobilization proved detrimental to its own cause, as arguments

06:42.340 --> 06:47.960
made in media that 99.9% of gun owners abide by the law, for example, gave way to high-profile

06:47.960 --> 06:52.420
figures like the Vice President of the Firearm Owners Association threatening bloodshed if

06:52.420 --> 06:54.820
stricter regulations went through.

06:54.820 --> 06:58.900
In less than a week after the Port Arthur massacre, the political determination emanating

06:58.900 --> 07:03.340
from Parliament had resulted in a cabinet agreement on a prohibition on automatic rifles,

07:03.340 --> 07:08.040
semi-automatic rifles, and pump-action shotguns, the creation of a national firearm registration

07:08.040 --> 07:11.580
system, and a compensation fund for a gun buyback program.

07:11.580 --> 07:15.860
Four days later, on May 10th, the Prime Minister hosted the police ministers from all states

07:15.860 --> 07:20.140
and territories to present the 10-point plan that soon informed the nation's first set

07:20.140 --> 07:24.960
of universal gun laws—what would be known as the National Firearms Agreement.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.780
Even with broad public support, the NFA was hard won.

07:28.780 --> 07:33.140
Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia refused to agree to the NFA for

07:33.140 --> 07:37.820
months and pushed for semi-automatics to remain legal as long as they were crimped, or modified

07:37.820 --> 07:39.640
to carry limited rounds.

07:39.640 --> 07:44.260
Only after Howard threatened to expand federal power did they join the nationwide program.

07:44.260 --> 07:47.460
In some places, the NFA was bitterly resented.

07:47.460 --> 07:51.300
During speaking tours intended to explain and promote the program, Deputy Prime Minister

07:51.300 --> 07:55.540
Tim Fisher was burned in effigy in the Queensland state of Gympie, while Prime Minister Howard

07:55.540 --> 07:59.280
donned a bulletproof vest when speaking in Sale, Victoria.

07:59.280 --> 08:03.580
With all states and territories signed on by the middle of 1996, the agreement flipped

08:03.580 --> 08:07.700
Australia's loose, decentralized gun laws—on their head.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.300
What was once a system so scant that a law student reading through gun statues thought

08:11.300 --> 08:16.320
there were pages missing, had suddenly become one of the world's most thorough.

08:16.320 --> 08:20.640
Only a gun and gun sale now had to be recorded in a national registry.

08:20.640 --> 08:24.920
Anyone who owned or sought to own a gun needed to prove they had a genuine reason—crucially,

08:24.920 --> 08:29.540
in the eyes of Australian policymakers, self-defense was not one.

08:29.540 --> 08:32.820
Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were now banned except for when a farmer or professional

08:32.820 --> 08:35.220
shooter could prove genuine reason.

08:35.220 --> 08:39.680
Gun owners now needed to be 18 or older, needed to pass a safety course, and had to abide

08:39.680 --> 08:41.680
by strict gun storage rules.

08:42.160 --> 08:46.420
And if in possession of a newly-prohibited gun, Australians now had 12 months to surrender

08:46.420 --> 08:50.240
it and receive fair compensation, funded by a one-time Medicare levy.

08:50.240 --> 08:56.000
A year later, Australia had confiscated and destroyed 650,000 guns, and it did so under

08:56.000 --> 09:02.000
budget as the project cost Australian taxpayers around $360 million.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.460
So… did it work?

09:05.460 --> 09:09.640
Did the sweeping, disruptive reforms of the National Firearms Agreement actually save

09:09.640 --> 09:10.640
lives?

09:10.640 --> 09:15.080
Well, in the decade leading up to the Port Arthur Massacre, the country experienced 12

09:15.080 --> 09:20.000
shootings with at least four fatal victims, totaling 98 individuals killed.

09:20.000 --> 09:25.120
In the decade after the Port Arthur Massacre, Australia experienced none.

09:25.120 --> 09:30.360
In fact, in the 26 years since, there have been only three mass shootings with a total

09:30.360 --> 09:32.560
of 12 victims.

09:32.560 --> 09:37.560
Proponents point to this as the conclusive piece of evidence that Australia's gun restrictions

09:37.560 --> 09:44.000
were a masterstroke of public policy—a single maneuver that solved a massive, deadly

09:44.000 --> 09:45.880
problem.

09:45.880 --> 09:51.320
But others are quick to point out that mass shootings are a relatively rare event.

09:51.320 --> 09:55.420
Even during Australia's most notorious and deadly decade of shootings, they occurred

09:55.420 --> 09:57.960
just over once a year.

09:57.960 --> 10:02.740
While undoubtedly tragic on a human level, from a statistical standpoint, this frequency

10:02.740 --> 10:06.960
instills relatively low confidence in any observed trend.

10:06.960 --> 10:11.800
The confidence is lowered yet further when glancing back another decade—from 1976

10:11.800 --> 10:16.320
to 1986, there were just two shootings with ten total victims.

10:16.320 --> 10:22.000
So, was the ten years starting in 96th a deviation from the trend, or was it the ten years starting

10:22.000 --> 10:23.960
in 86?

10:23.960 --> 10:27.320
Especially in the context of mass shootings, where shooters get inspired by shooters who

10:27.320 --> 10:31.920
get inspired by shooters, was there simply a spate of violence followed by a regression

10:31.920 --> 10:33.240
to the mean?

10:33.240 --> 10:38.120
To determine this, one can substitute this low-frequency statistic for a higher-frequency

10:38.120 --> 10:43.040
equivalent—the more data points, the more one can be confident in causation over mere

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
correlation.

10:44.040 --> 10:48.120
While the National Firearms Agreement was implemented in response to a mass shooting,

10:48.120 --> 10:51.320
it was concurrently designed to address all types of gun violence.

10:51.320 --> 10:56.760
So, Australia's overall firearm mortality rate can be used as a proxy metric in examining

10:56.760 --> 10:58.840
the policy's effectiveness.

10:58.840 --> 11:04.820
In 1996, the year of the Port Arthur Massacre, this rate sat at 2.84 gun deaths per year

11:04.820 --> 11:09.440
per 100,000 people—today, it's just 0.9.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.640
A threefold drop in less than three decades surely proves that gun control curbed gun

11:14.640 --> 11:21.080
violence, but some are quick to respond that trends don't mean anything in isolation.

11:21.080 --> 11:26.280
Glancing backwards, firearm fatality in Australia was already on the decline, and the drop from

11:26.280 --> 11:31.040
2.84 was just a continuation of the drop from 4.7.

11:31.040 --> 11:35.980
Prior to 1996, according to research led by gun policy expert Philipp Alpers, the rate

11:35.980 --> 11:39.480
of decline was an average of 3% a year.

11:39.480 --> 11:46.960
Post-1996, however, it accelerated to 4.9—a meaningful, measurable, near-doubling in rate,

11:46.960 --> 11:50.840
right after the most significant gun policy reform in decades.

11:51.400 --> 11:57.260
Now, while certainly stronger, there are still potentially holes in this proof.

11:57.260 --> 12:01.720
One could, and some have argued that this too could be random chance—that the rate

12:01.720 --> 12:07.460
of decline had the option of staying the same, or decelerating, or accelerating post-1996,

12:07.460 --> 12:10.560
and it just so happened that the third option occurred.

12:10.560 --> 12:16.240
But there is yet another method of establishing causality—a method that has real-world,

12:16.240 --> 12:18.560
practical evidence behind its effectiveness.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.720
It's called rare-event predictive modeling.

12:21.720 --> 12:26.220
You see, predictive modeling for common events is fairly straightforward—a streaming service

12:26.220 --> 12:30.240
like Netflix, for example, will use troves of data to build out a model for how long

12:30.240 --> 12:34.920
it expects a given customer to stick around based on factors like their age, home address,

12:34.920 --> 12:36.360
gender, and more.

12:36.360 --> 12:40.240
This model is useful, since, if the company learns that a given sign-up in Illinois, for

12:40.240 --> 12:45.120
example, stays subscribed on average four months longer than a given customer from Massachusetts,

12:45.120 --> 12:49.020
the company can afford to spend more marketing to those Illinois-based customers, since their

12:49.020 --> 12:51.280
lifetime value is higher.

12:51.280 --> 12:56.320
Netflix and others rely on the sheer quantity of data points to build out highly specific,

12:56.320 --> 12:58.680
highly accurate models like this.

12:58.680 --> 13:03.000
The rarer an event becomes, though, the tougher it is to build out an accurate, predictive

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
model.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.920
But it's not impossible, and the reason why it's not impossible is because time

13:07.920 --> 13:11.880
and money have been poured into developing and validating predictive models for rare

13:11.880 --> 13:16.960
events thanks to the massive industry it makes possible—insurance.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.360
How the insurance industry works is simple.

13:20.360 --> 13:24.460
Individuals are way more afraid of having a 1 in 10,000 chance of having their home

13:24.460 --> 13:29.840
robbed and having to spend $100,000 to replace things than having a 1 in 10 chance of breaking

13:29.840 --> 13:32.320
their microwave and having to spend $100.

13:32.320 --> 13:37.440
That's despite the fact that in either scenario, the average person is going to be out $10

13:37.440 --> 13:38.600
either way.

13:38.600 --> 13:44.560
$100,000 divided by $10,000 is $10, and so is $100 divided by $10.

13:44.560 --> 13:49.200
While in isolation illogical, this bias is in reality pragmatic, since far more people

13:49.200 --> 13:54.400
can weather a $100 expense than a $100,000 one without going into debt and financial

13:54.400 --> 13:55.400
hardship.

13:55.400 --> 13:59.880
Therefore, what insurance does is aggregate 10,000 people with that 1 in 10,000 chance

13:59.880 --> 14:04.320
together and charge them each $10 so that the one of them that does get robbed doesn't

14:04.320 --> 14:05.680
go into financial ruin.

14:05.760 --> 14:11.080
Except, they don't really charge them $10—they charge them, say, $11 so that they can turn

14:11.080 --> 14:15.360
a profit—but in order to do this, they need to determine what the likelihood of a given

14:15.360 --> 14:17.240
individual getting robbed is.

14:17.240 --> 14:22.560
And again, the events that insurance companies insure against are by their very nature rare

14:22.560 --> 14:25.960
because those are the ones people are worried about.

14:25.960 --> 14:30.960
Therefore, insurers need to take in a miniscule number of data points and build a predictive

14:30.960 --> 14:32.620
model based on them.

14:32.620 --> 14:37.180
If they do it wrong and consider home robberies more common than reality, they'll overcharge

14:37.180 --> 14:42.060
and a competitor will come in, undercut their prices, and capture all their customers.

14:42.060 --> 14:45.680
If they consider it less likely than reality, they'll run out of money from paying out

14:45.680 --> 14:48.720
more to robbed customers than they take in.

14:48.720 --> 14:53.180
Without diving into the mind-numbing mathematics behind rare event predictive modeling, the

14:53.180 --> 14:57.540
proof that it works is that the insurance industry exists.

14:57.540 --> 15:01.500
The proof is that these companies can only make a profit if they've accurately predicted

15:01.500 --> 15:07.140
the commonality of events as rare and unlikely as sinkholes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,

15:07.140 --> 15:12.540
missile attacks, plane crashes, bear attacks, and more, damaging and destroying homes.

15:12.540 --> 15:16.860
The same rare event predictive modeling techniques were applied in research led by Simon Chapman

15:16.860 --> 15:19.720
of the University of Sydney's School of Public Health.

15:19.720 --> 15:23.740
He and his co-researchers looked at the data on Australian shootings in the same way an

15:23.740 --> 15:29.660
insurer would, and built a rare events predictive model that indicated between 1996 and 2018,

15:29.660 --> 15:34.380
when the study was conducted, there should have been 16.3 mass shootings in the country,

15:34.380 --> 15:37.280
with a minimum of 65 fatal victims.

15:37.280 --> 15:39.940
In reality, there were just two.

15:39.940 --> 15:43.220
Building on that baseline, the researchers were able to calculate the likelihood that

15:43.220 --> 15:47.320
this trend could be explained simply by random chance—that the rarity of mass shootings

15:47.320 --> 15:51.320
meant that their 22-year absence was merely a data anomaly.

15:51.320 --> 15:55.580
The answer was one in two hundred thousand.

15:56.580 --> 16:01.660
That's to say, there's a chance that the absence in mass shootings in Australia post-1996

16:01.660 --> 16:06.260
was caused by the natural ebb and flow in their occurrence, but that chance is one in

16:06.260 --> 16:07.540
two hundred thousand.

16:07.540 --> 16:14.460
Meanwhile, there's a 199,999 in two hundred thousand chance that something other than

16:14.460 --> 16:18.980
random chance is behind the trend—something like the implementation of the most significant

16:18.980 --> 16:22.100
gun control measures in the country's history.

16:22.100 --> 16:27.380
One can't ever outright, 100% prove a link between two separate occurrences in the real

16:27.380 --> 16:28.380
world.

16:28.380 --> 16:32.180
This is why people say that correlation does not imply causation.

16:32.180 --> 16:35.460
If you asked a data scientist to prove that flipping your light switch light to your light

16:35.460 --> 16:39.140
turning off, they'd tell you that there's a chance that the light was on a timer scheduled

16:39.140 --> 16:43.220
to switch off at that moment regardless, or that there's a chance that the research

16:43.220 --> 16:46.740
assistant tasked with collecting data about switch flips and light illumination was being

16:46.740 --> 16:51.020
bribed to make them look more correlated than reality, or that there's a chance that the

16:51.020 --> 16:54.300
light wasn't real in the first place and was just a hologram made to make you think

16:54.300 --> 16:56.640
it was turning off in time with the switch.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.980
These are all unlikely, but technically not impossible.

16:59.980 --> 17:05.300
In a world of infinite possibility, one can always find another genuinely possible cause

17:05.300 --> 17:07.060
for a given outcome.

17:07.060 --> 17:11.740
The data scientists will always tell you there's a one-in-a-lot chance that something other

17:11.740 --> 17:15.500
than flipping the switch led to the light turning off.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.940
But probably not.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.400
It probably wasn't any of that.

17:19.400 --> 17:24.680
Flipping the light switch probably led to the light turning off.

17:24.680 --> 17:28.520
In every way, it's tough to make videos about subjects with the weight and tragic

17:28.520 --> 17:30.360
significance of this one.

17:30.360 --> 17:34.480
From word choice and motion graphics to visuals, and a close reading of YouTube's content

17:34.480 --> 17:39.040
guidelines, we have to put a lot of thought into how to cover and visualize this story.

17:39.040 --> 17:42.920
Thankfully, we have our sponsor Storyblocks, who has allowed us to take this subject on

17:42.920 --> 17:47.160
in the first place by sponsoring this tough-to-monetize video.

17:47.160 --> 17:51.360
Long before they sponsored this channel, Storyblocks was quite literally the first place I turned

17:51.360 --> 17:55.040
for stock footage—its footage is what the very first video on this channel is almost

17:55.040 --> 17:59.760
entirely made up of—and because they're still built for small-scale, independent creators,

17:59.760 --> 18:02.780
I still use Storyblocks for stock footage today.

18:02.780 --> 18:06.320
With their unlimited subscription, you can use and download all the material you want

18:06.320 --> 18:10.560
for less than what a single clip might run you at another stock footage provider.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.260
Storyblocks offers way more than just stock footage, too—they also carry After Effects

18:14.260 --> 18:17.700
and Premiere Pro templates, images, music, and sound effects.

18:17.700 --> 18:21.260
No matter what you end up using from their demand-driven library, though, you won't

18:21.260 --> 18:25.220
have to worry about royalties—Storyblocks is entirely royalty-free, meaning you can

18:25.220 --> 18:29.660
use their stuff for any commercial or personal project without having to think about it down

18:29.660 --> 18:30.660
the line.

18:30.660 --> 18:33.860
I've used Storyblocks from the beginning, and I can tell you from personal experience

18:33.860 --> 18:37.660
that it's been a crucial resource for this channel and channels like it.

18:37.660 --> 18:41.460
If you're making videos already or want to become a creator, give Storyblocks a try.

18:41.460 --> 18:45.500
Click the button on screen or head to Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be

18:45.500 --> 18:47.940
