0	4740	Australia is a nation defined by starkness.
4740	9420	Evoking images of the New World, and mirroring the process of Western expansion, European
9420	14240	settlers arrived on an untamed continent, pushed across vast wilderness, through hostile
14240	21620	indigenous populations, and established, then doggedly defended, a few narrow bands of civilization.
21620	26500	As the years rolled forward, cascading sequences of gold rushes and increasing need for agricultural
26500	31520	output pulled Australian society further from the convenient natural harbors where
31520	32820	it began.
32820	37220	With Man and Beast continuously working to reclaim the land they usurped, the increasingly
37220	41680	small and informal groups of settlers on the frontier relied on their more advanced weaponry
41680	44020	to maintain their foothold.
44020	48460	Guns matured into a standard-issue piece of kit for those straying beyond the established
48460	49460	towns.
49460	52620	A century on, that reality remained.
53060	57300	20th century Australians continued to leave the comfortable confines of coastal cities
57300	61240	in hope of transforming rural land into a living.
61240	65540	Those that found themselves in this less urban life, in turn, inherited a unique culture
65540	70300	and identity framed around individualism and rugged self-reliance.
70300	74720	These individuals were proud of their lifestyle, providing for their families and nation through
74720	77020	what they helped pull from the earth.
77060	83100	Yet, even as technology advanced, nature proved unruly, and so rural Australians continued
83100	88980	to rely on their weaponry to defend their crops or livestock or minerals from the other.
88980	94340	Among this population, guns had become conflated with culture—they were important tools,
94340	98300	they were pest control, they were family heirlooms, they were security.
98300	102620	But as urban Australia continued to develop alongside rural Australia, guns in cities
102620	105720	and suburbs began to seem superfluous.
105720	111160	Guns no longer worth the inherent risk of operating, and in untrained or uncertain hands,
111160	113280	potential disasters.
113280	118480	All the while, as this rift widened, the weapons grew more effective.
118480	123040	The destructive potential of a minute shrunk down to a second.
123040	128920	What was once but a cultural difference morphed into an issue—should personal gun ownership
128920	130260	be allowed?
130260	134380	Was the necessity of some stronger than the risk to most, as the potential for misuse
134380	137540	grew in step with technological development?
137540	142100	As the century progressed, as the cosmopolitan and countryside continued to drift apart,
142100	147780	the issue escalated, and the questions informing the issue begged for an answer.
147780	153300	Australia's gun debate—informed by history, landscape, and legacy, intensified by growing
153300	158440	urban-rural divide and the technology's ruthless efficiency—was at an impasse.
158440	163000	As one exasperated New South Wales politician voiced after a futile national gun summit
163000	164720	in 1987, quote,
164720	170060	It will take a massacre in Tasmania before we get gun reform in Australia.
170060	174440	Nearly a decade later, his words proved prophetic.
174440	180720	It was just after one in the afternoon, on the 28th of April, 1996, when a 28-year-old
180720	185960	man in a yellow Volvo entered the Port Arthur Historic Site.
185960	190100	Carrying what security described as a sports-type bag through the tourist-laden formal penal
190100	197460	colony, the man entered a busy café, ate a meal, then opened fire on unsuspecting tourists.
197460	203140	Within just 90 seconds, the gunman had killed 20 people with 29 bullets.
203140	206900	Leaving the café, the shooting then continued onto the streets.
206900	212100	By the time of his capture the following day, the gunman had killed 35 and injured another
212100	213340	23.
213340	218940	In the hands of the murderer throughout his rampage was a semi-automatic Colt AR-15—a
218940	223620	weapon that, under Tasmania's uniquely hands-off gun laws, was available for purchase
223620	225980	without a license.
225980	230320	All told, it was the worst mass shooting in the nation's history, and while perpetrated
230320	237260	in a far corner of the country, the sheer depravity rocked Australia to its core.
237260	240700	For a moment, the shocked nation stammered.
240700	241700	Then it began to move.
241700	247460	When the Port Arthur shooting was Australia's largest, it was far from the country's first.
247460	251060	The Hoddle Street killings and the Queen Street massacre, just months apart in Melbourne
251060	256760	in 1987, had set the backdrop for that year's ultimately fruitless national gun summit.
256760	262380	The gun violence continued into the new decade too, with one or more shootings in 1990, 1991,
262380	265020	1992, and 1993.
265020	272100	In ten years, Australia experienced 12 mass shootings, abruptly ending the lives of 98
272100	273100	people.
273520	277520	While gun ownership was common across the nation's history, the increase in mass shootings
277520	282720	and the high firearm death rate of 2.84 per 100,000 people, well above England's rate
282720	288560	of 0.42 per 100,000, were becoming too much for most Australians to bear.
288560	295900	By 1996, punctuated by the most horrific shooting of them all, Australians had had enough.
295900	302460	In a poll run days after the Port Arthur massacre, 90% of the 2,058 respondents supported a national
302460	308340	ban on automatic and semi-automatic firearms, and 88% supported registration requirements
308340	310260	for all firearms.
310260	315840	Simply put, average, everyday Australians were ready for change.
315840	321040	But popular public attitudes won't move policy alone—a fundamental restructuring
321040	326500	of Australian gun laws was anything but a foregone conclusion in the wake of Port Arthur.
326500	329840	Any attempt at sweeping change would have to navigate around the country's powerful
329840	334800	gun lobby, a vocal and impassioned minority of rural Australians wary of government overreach,
334800	339700	and the fact that gun policy was governed not by the federal government, but by states.
339700	344120	And yet, the day after the shooting, John Howard, Australia's Prime Minister for all
344120	349520	of 48 days, announced his effort to push through major gun law reform.
349520	354180	Howard and his coalition government had ample room to cop out—to throw their hands up
354180	356160	and say it was a state-level issue.
356160	358580	Instead, they pushed on.
358580	362620	As he later reflected, quote, you never let a good crisis go to waste.
362620	366700	Tragic though the event was, it gave us an opportunity to do something in the wake of
366700	369900	it, so that those lives were not lost in vain.
369900	374020	In the days that followed, cabinet meetings poured over studies pulled together by non-governmental
374020	378200	groups like the Coalition for Gun Control, and previously, internally produced policy
378200	381380	recommendations that followed the Melbourne shootings.
381380	385320	Outside of cabinet meetings, Howard urged representatives from his coalition of Liberal
385320	388180	and National Party members to stand with him.
388180	392700	But as Howard applied pressure on conservatives representing rural Australia, so too did the
392700	397740	nation's gun lobby, which organized marches, street demonstrations, and speeches.
397740	402340	Ultimately, the lobby's mobilization proved detrimental to its own cause, as arguments
402340	407960	made in media that 99.9% of gun owners abide by the law, for example, gave way to high-profile
407960	412420	figures like the Vice President of the Firearm Owners Association threatening bloodshed if
412420	414820	stricter regulations went through.
414820	418900	In less than a week after the Port Arthur massacre, the political determination emanating
418900	423340	from Parliament had resulted in a cabinet agreement on a prohibition on automatic rifles,
423340	428040	semi-automatic rifles, and pump-action shotguns, the creation of a national firearm registration
428040	431580	system, and a compensation fund for a gun buyback program.
431580	435860	Four days later, on May 10th, the Prime Minister hosted the police ministers from all states
435860	440140	and territories to present the 10-point plan that soon informed the nation's first set
440140	444960	of universal gun laws—what would be known as the National Firearms Agreement.
444960	448780	Even with broad public support, the NFA was hard won.
448780	453140	Queensland, the Northern Territory, and Western Australia refused to agree to the NFA for
453140	457820	months and pushed for semi-automatics to remain legal as long as they were crimped, or modified
457820	459640	to carry limited rounds.
459640	464260	Only after Howard threatened to expand federal power did they join the nationwide program.
464260	467460	In some places, the NFA was bitterly resented.
467460	471300	During speaking tours intended to explain and promote the program, Deputy Prime Minister
471300	475540	Tim Fisher was burned in effigy in the Queensland state of Gympie, while Prime Minister Howard
475540	479280	donned a bulletproof vest when speaking in Sale, Victoria.
479280	483580	With all states and territories signed on by the middle of 1996, the agreement flipped
483580	487700	Australia's loose, decentralized gun laws—on their head.
487700	491300	What was once a system so scant that a law student reading through gun statues thought
491300	496320	there were pages missing, had suddenly become one of the world's most thorough.
496320	500640	Only a gun and gun sale now had to be recorded in a national registry.
500640	504920	Anyone who owned or sought to own a gun needed to prove they had a genuine reason—crucially,
504920	509540	in the eyes of Australian policymakers, self-defense was not one.
509540	512820	Semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were now banned except for when a farmer or professional
512820	515220	shooter could prove genuine reason.
515220	519680	Gun owners now needed to be 18 or older, needed to pass a safety course, and had to abide
519680	521680	by strict gun storage rules.
522160	526420	And if in possession of a newly-prohibited gun, Australians now had 12 months to surrender
526420	530240	it and receive fair compensation, funded by a one-time Medicare levy.
530240	536000	A year later, Australia had confiscated and destroyed 650,000 guns, and it did so under
536000	542000	budget as the project cost Australian taxpayers around $360 million.
542000	545460	So… did it work?
545460	549640	Did the sweeping, disruptive reforms of the National Firearms Agreement actually save
549640	550640	lives?
550640	555080	Well, in the decade leading up to the Port Arthur Massacre, the country experienced 12
555080	560000	shootings with at least four fatal victims, totaling 98 individuals killed.
560000	565120	In the decade after the Port Arthur Massacre, Australia experienced none.
565120	570360	In fact, in the 26 years since, there have been only three mass shootings with a total
570360	572560	of 12 victims.
572560	577560	Proponents point to this as the conclusive piece of evidence that Australia's gun restrictions
577560	584000	were a masterstroke of public policy—a single maneuver that solved a massive, deadly
584000	585880	problem.
585880	591320	But others are quick to point out that mass shootings are a relatively rare event.
591320	595420	Even during Australia's most notorious and deadly decade of shootings, they occurred
595420	597960	just over once a year.
597960	602740	While undoubtedly tragic on a human level, from a statistical standpoint, this frequency
602740	606960	instills relatively low confidence in any observed trend.
606960	611800	The confidence is lowered yet further when glancing back another decade—from 1976
611800	616320	to 1986, there were just two shootings with ten total victims.
616320	622000	So, was the ten years starting in 96th a deviation from the trend, or was it the ten years starting
622000	623960	in 86?
623960	627320	Especially in the context of mass shootings, where shooters get inspired by shooters who
627320	631920	get inspired by shooters, was there simply a spate of violence followed by a regression
631920	633240	to the mean?
633240	638120	To determine this, one can substitute this low-frequency statistic for a higher-frequency
638120	643040	equivalent—the more data points, the more one can be confident in causation over mere
643040	644040	correlation.
644040	648120	While the National Firearms Agreement was implemented in response to a mass shooting,
648120	651320	it was concurrently designed to address all types of gun violence.
651320	656760	So, Australia's overall firearm mortality rate can be used as a proxy metric in examining
656760	658840	the policy's effectiveness.
658840	664820	In 1996, the year of the Port Arthur Massacre, this rate sat at 2.84 gun deaths per year
664820	669440	per 100,000 people—today, it's just 0.9.
669440	674640	A threefold drop in less than three decades surely proves that gun control curbed gun
674640	681080	violence, but some are quick to respond that trends don't mean anything in isolation.
681080	686280	Glancing backwards, firearm fatality in Australia was already on the decline, and the drop from
686280	691040	2.84 was just a continuation of the drop from 4.7.
691040	695980	Prior to 1996, according to research led by gun policy expert Philipp Alpers, the rate
695980	699480	of decline was an average of 3% a year.
699480	706960	Post-1996, however, it accelerated to 4.9—a meaningful, measurable, near-doubling in rate,
706960	710840	right after the most significant gun policy reform in decades.
711400	717260	Now, while certainly stronger, there are still potentially holes in this proof.
717260	721720	One could, and some have argued that this too could be random chance—that the rate
721720	727460	of decline had the option of staying the same, or decelerating, or accelerating post-1996,
727460	730560	and it just so happened that the third option occurred.
730560	736240	But there is yet another method of establishing causality—a method that has real-world,
736240	738560	practical evidence behind its effectiveness.
738560	741720	It's called rare-event predictive modeling.
741720	746220	You see, predictive modeling for common events is fairly straightforward—a streaming service
746220	750240	like Netflix, for example, will use troves of data to build out a model for how long
750240	754920	it expects a given customer to stick around based on factors like their age, home address,
754920	756360	gender, and more.
756360	760240	This model is useful, since, if the company learns that a given sign-up in Illinois, for
760240	765120	example, stays subscribed on average four months longer than a given customer from Massachusetts,
765120	769020	the company can afford to spend more marketing to those Illinois-based customers, since their
769020	771280	lifetime value is higher.
771280	776320	Netflix and others rely on the sheer quantity of data points to build out highly specific,
776320	778680	highly accurate models like this.
778680	783000	The rarer an event becomes, though, the tougher it is to build out an accurate, predictive
783000	784000	model.
784000	787920	But it's not impossible, and the reason why it's not impossible is because time
787920	791880	and money have been poured into developing and validating predictive models for rare
791880	796960	events thanks to the massive industry it makes possible—insurance.
796960	800360	How the insurance industry works is simple.
800360	804460	Individuals are way more afraid of having a 1 in 10,000 chance of having their home
804460	809840	robbed and having to spend $100,000 to replace things than having a 1 in 10 chance of breaking
809840	812320	their microwave and having to spend $100.
812320	817440	That's despite the fact that in either scenario, the average person is going to be out $10
817440	818600	either way.
818600	824560	$100,000 divided by $10,000 is $10, and so is $100 divided by $10.
824560	829200	While in isolation illogical, this bias is in reality pragmatic, since far more people
829200	834400	can weather a $100 expense than a $100,000 one without going into debt and financial
834400	835400	hardship.
835400	839880	Therefore, what insurance does is aggregate 10,000 people with that 1 in 10,000 chance
839880	844320	together and charge them each $10 so that the one of them that does get robbed doesn't
844320	845680	go into financial ruin.
845760	851080	Except, they don't really charge them $10—they charge them, say, $11 so that they can turn
851080	855360	a profit—but in order to do this, they need to determine what the likelihood of a given
855360	857240	individual getting robbed is.
857240	862560	And again, the events that insurance companies insure against are by their very nature rare
862560	865960	because those are the ones people are worried about.
865960	870960	Therefore, insurers need to take in a miniscule number of data points and build a predictive
870960	872620	model based on them.
872620	877180	If they do it wrong and consider home robberies more common than reality, they'll overcharge
877180	882060	and a competitor will come in, undercut their prices, and capture all their customers.
882060	885680	If they consider it less likely than reality, they'll run out of money from paying out
885680	888720	more to robbed customers than they take in.
888720	893180	Without diving into the mind-numbing mathematics behind rare event predictive modeling, the
893180	897540	proof that it works is that the insurance industry exists.
897540	901500	The proof is that these companies can only make a profit if they've accurately predicted
901500	907140	the commonality of events as rare and unlikely as sinkholes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
907140	912540	missile attacks, plane crashes, bear attacks, and more, damaging and destroying homes.
912540	916860	The same rare event predictive modeling techniques were applied in research led by Simon Chapman
916860	919720	of the University of Sydney's School of Public Health.
919720	923740	He and his co-researchers looked at the data on Australian shootings in the same way an
923740	929660	insurer would, and built a rare events predictive model that indicated between 1996 and 2018,
929660	934380	when the study was conducted, there should have been 16.3 mass shootings in the country,
934380	937280	with a minimum of 65 fatal victims.
937280	939940	In reality, there were just two.
939940	943220	Building on that baseline, the researchers were able to calculate the likelihood that
943220	947320	this trend could be explained simply by random chance—that the rarity of mass shootings
947320	951320	meant that their 22-year absence was merely a data anomaly.
951320	955580	The answer was one in two hundred thousand.
956580	961660	That's to say, there's a chance that the absence in mass shootings in Australia post-1996
961660	966260	was caused by the natural ebb and flow in their occurrence, but that chance is one in
966260	967540	two hundred thousand.
967540	974460	Meanwhile, there's a 199,999 in two hundred thousand chance that something other than
974460	978980	random chance is behind the trend—something like the implementation of the most significant
978980	982100	gun control measures in the country's history.
982100	987380	One can't ever outright, 100% prove a link between two separate occurrences in the real
987380	988380	world.
988380	992180	This is why people say that correlation does not imply causation.
992180	995460	If you asked a data scientist to prove that flipping your light switch light to your light
995460	999140	turning off, they'd tell you that there's a chance that the light was on a timer scheduled
999140	1003220	to switch off at that moment regardless, or that there's a chance that the research
1003220	1006740	assistant tasked with collecting data about switch flips and light illumination was being
1006740	1011020	bribed to make them look more correlated than reality, or that there's a chance that the
1011020	1014300	light wasn't real in the first place and was just a hologram made to make you think
1014300	1016640	it was turning off in time with the switch.
1016640	1019980	These are all unlikely, but technically not impossible.
1019980	1025300	In a world of infinite possibility, one can always find another genuinely possible cause
1025300	1027060	for a given outcome.
1027060	1031740	The data scientists will always tell you there's a one-in-a-lot chance that something other
1031740	1035500	than flipping the switch led to the light turning off.
1035500	1036940	But probably not.
1036940	1039400	It probably wasn't any of that.
1039400	1044680	Flipping the light switch probably led to the light turning off.
1044680	1048520	In every way, it's tough to make videos about subjects with the weight and tragic
1048520	1050360	significance of this one.
1050360	1054480	From word choice and motion graphics to visuals, and a close reading of YouTube's content
1054480	1059040	guidelines, we have to put a lot of thought into how to cover and visualize this story.
1059040	1062920	Thankfully, we have our sponsor Storyblocks, who has allowed us to take this subject on
1062920	1067160	in the first place by sponsoring this tough-to-monetize video.
1067160	1071360	Long before they sponsored this channel, Storyblocks was quite literally the first place I turned
1071360	1075040	for stock footage—its footage is what the very first video on this channel is almost
1075040	1079760	entirely made up of—and because they're still built for small-scale, independent creators,
1079760	1082780	I still use Storyblocks for stock footage today.
1082780	1086320	With their unlimited subscription, you can use and download all the material you want
1086320	1090560	for less than what a single clip might run you at another stock footage provider.
1090560	1094260	Storyblocks offers way more than just stock footage, too—they also carry After Effects
1094260	1097700	and Premiere Pro templates, images, music, and sound effects.
1097700	1101260	No matter what you end up using from their demand-driven library, though, you won't
1101260	1105220	have to worry about royalties—Storyblocks is entirely royalty-free, meaning you can
1105220	1109660	use their stuff for any commercial or personal project without having to think about it down
1109660	1110660	the line.
1110660	1113860	I've used Storyblocks from the beginning, and I can tell you from personal experience
1113860	1117660	that it's been a crucial resource for this channel and channels like it.
1117660	1121460	If you're making videos already or want to become a creator, give Storyblocks a try.
1121460	1125500	Click the button on screen or head to Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be
1125500	1127940	supporting Wendover while you're at it.
