00:07.860 --> 00:11.740
The richest country in the world is Qatar, which looks like this.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.580
The second richest country is Luxembourg, which looks like this.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.580
The third richest is Singapore, which looks like this.

00:18.580 --> 00:24.260
The commonality between these three is that each of them has more than 90% of their population

00:24.260 --> 00:25.820
living in cities.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.640
The three poorest countries—the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic

00:29.640 --> 00:35.080
of the Congo, and Burundi—each have urbanization levels below 50%.

00:35.080 --> 00:39.560
Comparing the wealth of African countries and the urbanization levels of African countries,

00:39.560 --> 00:42.080
the maps are nearly identical.

00:42.080 --> 00:46.960
That is not to say that cities automatically create wealth or wealth automatically creates

00:46.960 --> 00:50.920
cities, but there is a direct correlation between the two.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.840
Although, it seems strange that humans would choose to live in cities.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.400
Living costs are higher, air quality is worse, surroundings are more crowded, crime is more

00:59.400 --> 01:02.200
prevalent, and disease is more easily spread.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.560
If the population of the world spread itself out evenly, every single person would have

01:06.560 --> 01:09.640
five acres to live on, but we don't.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.800
We live in a world where half the population lives on just 1% of the land.

01:14.800 --> 01:20.120
54% of the world population now lives in cities and that's significant.

01:20.120 --> 01:23.600
Fifty-five years ago, only half that lived a city life.

01:23.600 --> 01:29.860
The urbanization of the world is changing the world, but why do cities even exist?

01:29.860 --> 01:32.000
Humans were originally hunter-gatherers.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.200
They scavenged for food and often didn't live in a set place, similar to how animals

01:36.200 --> 01:40.460
live, but then in 10,000 BC we learned to farm.

01:40.460 --> 01:45.440
The domestication of plants allowed humans to finally settle down in one singular place

01:45.440 --> 01:50.260
and establish a long-term home, but farming was nothing like it is today.

01:50.260 --> 01:53.760
The humans of the era lacked technology and expertise.

01:53.760 --> 01:58.140
The first archaeological evidence of plowed fields—a process that greatly improves crop

01:58.140 --> 02:02.000
yields—doesn't appear until about 3,000 BC.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.260
It took thousands more years for farmers to successfully domesticate animals like the

02:06.260 --> 02:07.720
ox to pull a plow.

02:07.720 --> 02:12.560
When humans first began farming, nearly every individual had to farm in order to make enough

02:12.560 --> 02:13.780
food to live.

02:13.780 --> 02:18.920
One person's work essentially produced one person's food, but through time as technological

02:18.920 --> 02:23.820
advancements occurred, progressively each individual was able to make more and more

02:23.820 --> 02:24.820
food.

02:24.820 --> 02:30.020
Thanks to that, farmers today each feed 155 people.

02:30.020 --> 02:35.260
The process has also become so efficient that only one acre of land is now needed to feed

02:35.260 --> 02:39.760
one person, but back in the early days of farming, once technology had advanced to the

02:39.760 --> 02:44.260
point where one person made more than one person's food, for the first time ever,

02:44.260 --> 02:46.780
there were some people who didn't need to farm.

02:46.780 --> 02:49.100
And that fact changed humanity.

02:49.100 --> 02:53.680
If that had never happened, we would all still be living in ancient history.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.920
The surplus of food and the development of cities really went hand in hand.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.680
It had never before been possible for humans to live in dense urban conglomerations because

03:02.680 --> 03:07.360
they needed land to farm, but these extra people, freed from farming, were able to work

03:07.360 --> 03:13.220
jobs other than farming which led to languages, literature, science, and really all the technological

03:13.220 --> 03:16.000
advancements that made our modern world.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.980
The spatial patterns of humans really happen quite naturally.

03:19.980 --> 03:24.520
Enough people are each making their decision on where to live that, in aggregate, humans

03:24.520 --> 03:27.060
are going to live in the best places to live.

03:27.060 --> 03:32.300
There's a sort of process of natural selection that happens as billions of humans each pick

03:32.300 --> 03:34.580
their optimal place to live.

03:34.580 --> 03:39.320
Nothing is manufactured about where people live and numbers back this up.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.640
You see, cities tend to stay at the same rank throughout history.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.580
In 1800, the largest city in Europe was London.

03:46.580 --> 03:49.980
Today, the largest city in Europe is still London.

03:49.980 --> 03:55.560
In 1800, the second largest city in Europe was Paris and it too remains second today.

03:55.560 --> 04:00.500
Cities grow, but those that were large in the past tend to stay large—at least without

04:00.500 --> 04:02.340
external influence.

04:02.340 --> 04:07.340
Cities don't just change ranking on their own, they change rank if something else changes.

04:07.340 --> 04:11.820
Hong Kong, for example, changed rank when a change in sovereignty to British drew people

04:11.820 --> 04:17.120
in while with San Francisco the discovery of natural resources, particularly gold, increased

04:17.120 --> 04:22.040
growth rates while with Washington DC, the coming of a new industry, the US government

04:22.040 --> 04:23.280
changed the rank.

04:23.280 --> 04:28.060
If you were to put a pause on all activity but humans moving, rankings would hypothetically

04:28.060 --> 04:33.400
stay exactly the same, but that's not even the best evidence for how natural the existence

04:33.400 --> 04:34.760
of cities is.

04:34.760 --> 04:39.700
According to the US Census Bureau, the largest city in the US is New York with 8.5 million

04:39.700 --> 04:44.240
urban residents, then the second is Los Angeles with 4 million, roughly half as many as New

04:44.240 --> 04:50.580
York, then third is Chicago with 2.7 million, roughly a third, then Houston at 2.3, roughly

04:50.580 --> 04:54.600
a fourth, then Phoenix at 1.6 million, roughly a fifth.

04:54.600 --> 04:59.880
Each city's size is almost exactly determined by the largest city's size divided by its

04:59.880 --> 05:00.880
rank.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.400
It is uncanny how closely city sizes in countries follow this distribution.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.380
It's not just with the US.

05:07.380 --> 05:13.400
Germany's largest city, Berlin, has 3.5 million residents, then Hamburg has 1.8 million,

05:13.400 --> 05:18.580
almost exactly half, then Munich has slightly more than a third at 1.4 million, then Cologne

05:18.580 --> 05:23.760
has just a bit more than a fourth at 1 million, then Frankfurt has almost exactly a fifth

05:23.760 --> 05:25.480
at 700,000.

05:25.480 --> 05:30.080
Now there are anomalies, mostly countries with recent rapid population growth, but in

05:30.080 --> 05:35.100
a large number of countries the ranking of cities can be determined by this law, but

05:35.100 --> 05:38.320
significant is what else can be determined with this law.

05:38.320 --> 05:42.800
If you take a book and rank the frequency of words, it follows this distribution.

05:42.800 --> 05:47.840
If you take a stadium of people and rank them by income, it follows this distribution.

05:47.840 --> 05:53.020
If you take the sounds a dolphin makes and rank them by frequency, it too follows this

05:53.020 --> 05:54.240
distribution.

05:54.240 --> 06:00.720
The link between a distribution found in nature and the size of cities helps prove something—cities

06:00.720 --> 06:01.720
are natural.

06:01.720 --> 06:07.320
Humans will, given time and technological advancement, always form into cities.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.440
The existence of cities can really only happen when the pluses outweigh the minuses.

06:12.440 --> 06:17.000
Back before the food surplus there were few advantages to urbanized living and a huge

06:17.000 --> 06:22.260
disadvantage—a commute to farming land during a time when walking was for most the only

06:22.260 --> 06:23.700
transportation method.

06:23.700 --> 06:28.720
Today, the pluses have increased and keep increasing to the point where day by day more

06:28.720 --> 06:30.740
and more people live in cities.

06:30.740 --> 06:35.160
A major advantage for the existence of cities is the ability for different businesses to

06:35.160 --> 06:36.940
locate near each other.

06:36.940 --> 06:41.060
Part of the reason this is advantageous is that people come to cities to find jobs because

06:41.060 --> 06:45.820
all these businesses are there and so, if businesses want to hire the best people to

06:45.820 --> 06:48.540
be the best, they have to be in cities.

06:48.540 --> 06:52.860
It's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem, but nowadays, different cities tend to play

06:52.860 --> 06:55.900
host to different clusters of businesses.

06:55.900 --> 07:00.900
For example, LA is a hub for the entertainment industry, Boston is a hub for medical research,

07:00.900 --> 07:05.420
Dusseldorf is a hub for the telecommunications industry, and Singapore is a hub for the finance

07:05.420 --> 07:06.420
industry.

07:06.420 --> 07:10.740
In addition to the ability to tap into a common labor pool, businesses cluster because they

07:10.740 --> 07:14.460
want easy access to other businesses.

07:14.460 --> 07:19.020
Telecommunications companies like Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, and AT&T all exist as direct

07:19.020 --> 07:23.340
competitors in Dusseldorf but the reason they are there is because other companies exist

07:23.340 --> 07:25.680
there as well that they can work with.

07:25.680 --> 07:30.080
You and Dusseldorf are companies like Nokia, Google, and LG which each make the phones

07:30.080 --> 07:33.080
that the mobile service providers might stock in their stores.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.880
By all being in the same place, they can more easily collaborate and therefore they can

07:36.880 --> 07:38.840
run their businesses more efficiently.

07:38.840 --> 07:43.120
There's a sort of economies of scale effect when all sorts of companies are all packed

07:43.120 --> 07:44.960
together in one place.

07:44.960 --> 07:50.260
Now, not every business is in a city because there are plenty of cases where the minuses

07:50.260 --> 07:52.080
outweigh the pluses.

07:52.080 --> 07:56.840
You just won't see a car manufacturing plant in downtown Manhattan because it doesn't

07:56.840 --> 07:57.840
make sense.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.800
While there would be advantages such as access to a higher skilled labor pool, proximity

08:01.800 --> 08:06.260
to other businesses, and reduced transport costs by being closer to the final market,

08:06.260 --> 08:09.320
there are significant disadvantages.

08:09.320 --> 08:14.980
Land costs about $38 per square foot in New York so if Tesla, for example, wanted to move

08:14.980 --> 08:20.040
their factory to the city it would cost over $200 million in land alone.

08:20.040 --> 08:24.860
The benefits would never outweigh the costs and, in fact, it was this very problem that

08:24.860 --> 08:26.900
led to the decline of Detroit.

08:26.900 --> 08:31.220
The city was a major center of automobile manufacturing but eventually manufacturers

08:31.220 --> 08:35.840
figured out that they could greatly reduce costs by moving the plants out of the city.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.720
Without a major industry to employ individuals, many moved away and the population has steadily

08:40.720 --> 08:43.460
declined for the last few decades.

08:43.460 --> 08:45.740
Cities exist because they are efficient.

08:46.320 --> 08:50.180
Nobody's forcing individuals to move to cities, but billions have.

08:50.180 --> 08:54.040
Just imagine there were only ten people in existence and one product that each of them

08:54.040 --> 08:55.280
wanted to buy.

08:55.280 --> 08:59.920
If they were all equally spread out across this plain, the logical location for a distribution

08:59.920 --> 09:02.000
hub would be right in the center.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.260
Some individuals would happen to be close to the hub by chance, but overall the product

09:06.260 --> 09:10.360
would have to be shipped a large distance to get to every consumer.

09:10.360 --> 09:15.060
Now let's say that eight of those ten individuals lived together in a mini-city.

09:15.060 --> 09:19.620
The logical location for the distribution hub would then be right by the city.

09:19.620 --> 09:23.960
Shipping for the rural individuals would be slow and expensive, but overall the total

09:23.960 --> 09:27.280
shipping distance and cost to individuals would be lower.

09:27.280 --> 09:31.420
You can see this concept with where Amazon puts their warehouses in the UK.

09:31.420 --> 09:36.060
They could have one enormous warehouse at the geographic center of the country and save

09:36.060 --> 09:38.840
money through economies of scale, but they don't.

09:38.840 --> 09:43.800
They position each of their warehouses near major population centers to reduce the total

09:43.800 --> 09:45.200
shipping distance.

09:45.200 --> 09:49.340
In our modern context this concept is most easily demonstrated through shipping, but

09:49.340 --> 09:54.740
historically individuals had to purchase nearly all their goods at physical marketplaces.

09:54.740 --> 09:58.500
Even just 200 years ago walking was the primary means of transportation.

09:58.500 --> 10:04.320
In an hour nowadays we can drive 70 miles while in an hour 200 years ago individuals

10:04.320 --> 10:09.660
could walk only three miles so the push to live closer to marketplaces was even higher.

10:09.660 --> 10:14.560
This is why suburbanization is a new concept, but still more individuals than ever choose

10:14.560 --> 10:16.600
to live in cities.

10:16.600 --> 10:21.520
Division and specialization of labor was crucial to the development of our world.

10:21.520 --> 10:25.640
Imagine you made everything you used—you grew your food, you gathered and filtered

10:25.640 --> 10:30.160
your water, you built your own car—just imagine how long it would take you to build

10:30.160 --> 10:35.520
a car from scratch, at least a decade, and yet the average individual in the US can buy

10:35.520 --> 10:39.460
a brand new car from the money that they earn in about six months.

10:39.460 --> 10:43.380
That's because there are people better at making cars than you.

10:43.380 --> 10:47.140
There are some people who focus solely on mining iron then some individuals who focus

10:47.140 --> 10:51.740
solely on making glass and so there are thousands of people producing all the different inputs

10:51.740 --> 10:55.420
that go into making your car in the most efficient way possible.

10:55.420 --> 11:00.180
Let's say that you, for example, individually can make a pencil in 60 minutes and paper

11:00.180 --> 11:05.460
in 30 while another individual can make a pencil in 30 minutes and paper in 60.

11:05.460 --> 11:10.000
In a closed-off world it would take each of you 90 minutes to make a pencil and paper,

11:10.000 --> 11:13.840
but let's say you make two pieces of paper, which would take you an hour, and the other

11:13.840 --> 11:18.320
individual would make two pencils, which would take them an hour, and then you each trade.

11:18.320 --> 11:22.060
Neither of you have given up anything—you get exactly what you would have gotten by

11:22.060 --> 11:25.780
working independently—but you have each gained time.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.680
This is exactly why trade is beneficial.

11:28.680 --> 11:33.200
Certain people are better at making certain things so by everyone specializing in what

11:33.200 --> 11:37.620
they are good at, the entire world gets more without giving more.

11:37.620 --> 11:41.840
Cities make this trade easier which leads to more of it happening and therefore cities

11:41.840 --> 11:43.320
are efficient.

11:43.320 --> 11:48.140
Humans naturally want to find the path of least resistance and, with our spatial patterns,

11:48.140 --> 11:51.700
the path of least resistance is to all live together.

11:51.700 --> 11:55.600
Of course rural life will always exist and needs to exist, but if you were to have a

11:55.600 --> 12:01.280
hand to pick up and organize every human into the most efficient pattern possible, this

12:01.280 --> 12:03.120
is what it would look like.

12:03.120 --> 12:07.860
Cities don't create wealth and wealth doesn't create cities, but rather cities make wealth

12:07.860 --> 12:09.240
possible.

12:09.240 --> 12:14.500
Cities are efficient and efficiency creates wealth and so people create cities.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.880
