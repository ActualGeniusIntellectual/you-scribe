00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,740
The richest country in the world is Qatar, which looks like this.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,580
The second richest country is Luxembourg, which looks like this.

5
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,580
The third richest is Singapore, which looks like this.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,260
The commonality between these three is that each of them has more than 90% of their population

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,820
living in cities.

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,640
The three poorest countries—the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,080
of the Congo, and Burundi—each have urbanization levels below 50%.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:39,560
Comparing the wealth of African countries and the urbanization levels of African countries,

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,080
the maps are nearly identical.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,960
That is not to say that cities automatically create wealth or wealth automatically creates

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,920
cities, but there is a direct correlation between the two.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,840
Although, it seems strange that humans would choose to live in cities.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,400
Living costs are higher, air quality is worse, surroundings are more crowded, crime is more

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,200
prevalent, and disease is more easily spread.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,560
If the population of the world spread itself out evenly, every single person would have

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,640
five acres to live on, but we don't.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,800
We live in a world where half the population lives on just 1% of the land.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,120
54% of the world population now lives in cities and that's significant.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,600
Fifty-five years ago, only half that lived a city life.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,860
The urbanization of the world is changing the world, but why do cities even exist?

23
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,000
Humans were originally hunter-gatherers.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,200
They scavenged for food and often didn't live in a set place, similar to how animals

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,460
live, but then in 10,000 BC we learned to farm.

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,440
The domestication of plants allowed humans to finally settle down in one singular place

27
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,260
and establish a long-term home, but farming was nothing like it is today.

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,760
The humans of the era lacked technology and expertise.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,140
The first archaeological evidence of plowed fields—a process that greatly improves crop

30
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,000
yields—doesn't appear until about 3,000 BC.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,260
It took thousands more years for farmers to successfully domesticate animals like the

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,720
ox to pull a plow.

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,560
When humans first began farming, nearly every individual had to farm in order to make enough

34
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,780
food to live.

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,920
One person's work essentially produced one person's food, but through time as technological

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,820
advancements occurred, progressively each individual was able to make more and more

37
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,820
food.

38
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,020
Thanks to that, farmers today each feed 155 people.

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:35,260
The process has also become so efficient that only one acre of land is now needed to feed

40
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,760
one person, but back in the early days of farming, once technology had advanced to the

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,260
point where one person made more than one person's food, for the first time ever,

42
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,780
there were some people who didn't need to farm.

43
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,100
And that fact changed humanity.

44
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,680
If that had never happened, we would all still be living in ancient history.

45
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,920
The surplus of food and the development of cities really went hand in hand.

46
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,680
It had never before been possible for humans to live in dense urban conglomerations because

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,360
they needed land to farm, but these extra people, freed from farming, were able to work

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,220
jobs other than farming which led to languages, literature, science, and really all the technological

49
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,000
advancements that made our modern world.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,980
The spatial patterns of humans really happen quite naturally.

51
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,520
Enough people are each making their decision on where to live that, in aggregate, humans

52
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,060
are going to live in the best places to live.

53
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,300
There's a sort of process of natural selection that happens as billions of humans each pick

54
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,580
their optimal place to live.

55
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,320
Nothing is manufactured about where people live and numbers back this up.

56
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,640
You see, cities tend to stay at the same rank throughout history.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,580
In 1800, the largest city in Europe was London.

58
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,980
Today, the largest city in Europe is still London.

59
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,560
In 1800, the second largest city in Europe was Paris and it too remains second today.

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,500
Cities grow, but those that were large in the past tend to stay large—at least without

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,340
external influence.

62
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,340
Cities don't just change ranking on their own, they change rank if something else changes.

63
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,820
Hong Kong, for example, changed rank when a change in sovereignty to British drew people

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,120
in while with San Francisco the discovery of natural resources, particularly gold, increased

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,040
growth rates while with Washington DC, the coming of a new industry, the US government

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,280
changed the rank.

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,060
If you were to put a pause on all activity but humans moving, rankings would hypothetically

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,400
stay exactly the same, but that's not even the best evidence for how natural the existence

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,760
of cities is.

70
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,700
According to the US Census Bureau, the largest city in the US is New York with 8.5 million

71
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,240
urban residents, then the second is Los Angeles with 4 million, roughly half as many as New

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,580
York, then third is Chicago with 2.7 million, roughly a third, then Houston at 2.3, roughly

73
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,600
a fourth, then Phoenix at 1.6 million, roughly a fifth.

74
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,880
Each city's size is almost exactly determined by the largest city's size divided by its

75
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880
rank.

76
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,400
It is uncanny how closely city sizes in countries follow this distribution.

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,380
It's not just with the US.

78
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,400
Germany's largest city, Berlin, has 3.5 million residents, then Hamburg has 1.8 million,

79
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,580
almost exactly half, then Munich has slightly more than a third at 1.4 million, then Cologne

80
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,760
has just a bit more than a fourth at 1 million, then Frankfurt has almost exactly a fifth

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,480
at 700,000.

82
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,080
Now there are anomalies, mostly countries with recent rapid population growth, but in

83
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,100
a large number of countries the ranking of cities can be determined by this law, but

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,320
significant is what else can be determined with this law.

85
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,800
If you take a book and rank the frequency of words, it follows this distribution.

86
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,840
If you take a stadium of people and rank them by income, it follows this distribution.

87
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,020
If you take the sounds a dolphin makes and rank them by frequency, it too follows this

88
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,240
distribution.

89
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,720
The link between a distribution found in nature and the size of cities helps prove something—cities

90
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
are natural.

91
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,320
Humans will, given time and technological advancement, always form into cities.

92
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,440
The existence of cities can really only happen when the pluses outweigh the minuses.

93
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Back before the food surplus there were few advantages to urbanized living and a huge

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,260
disadvantage—a commute to farming land during a time when walking was for most the only

95
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,700
transportation method.

96
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,720
Today, the pluses have increased and keep increasing to the point where day by day more

97
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,740
and more people live in cities.

98
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,160
A major advantage for the existence of cities is the ability for different businesses to

99
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,940
locate near each other.

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,060
Part of the reason this is advantageous is that people come to cities to find jobs because

101
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,820
all these businesses are there and so, if businesses want to hire the best people to

102
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,540
be the best, they have to be in cities.

103
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,860
It's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem, but nowadays, different cities tend to play

104
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,900
host to different clusters of businesses.

105
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,900
For example, LA is a hub for the entertainment industry, Boston is a hub for medical research,

106
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,420
Dusseldorf is a hub for the telecommunications industry, and Singapore is a hub for the finance

107
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,420
industry.

108
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:10,740
In addition to the ability to tap into a common labor pool, businesses cluster because they

109
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:14,460
want easy access to other businesses.

110
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,020
Telecommunications companies like Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, and AT&T all exist as direct

111
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,340
competitors in Dusseldorf but the reason they are there is because other companies exist

112
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,680
there as well that they can work with.

113
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,080
You and Dusseldorf are companies like Nokia, Google, and LG which each make the phones

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,080
that the mobile service providers might stock in their stores.

115
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,880
By all being in the same place, they can more easily collaborate and therefore they can

116
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,840
run their businesses more efficiently.

117
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,120
There's a sort of economies of scale effect when all sorts of companies are all packed

118
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,960
together in one place.

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,260
Now, not every business is in a city because there are plenty of cases where the minuses

120
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,080
outweigh the pluses.

121
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,840
You just won't see a car manufacturing plant in downtown Manhattan because it doesn't

122
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,840
make sense.

123
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,800
While there would be advantages such as access to a higher skilled labor pool, proximity

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,260
to other businesses, and reduced transport costs by being closer to the final market,

125
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,320
there are significant disadvantages.

126
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,980
Land costs about $38 per square foot in New York so if Tesla, for example, wanted to move

127
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:20,040
their factory to the city it would cost over $200 million in land alone.

128
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,860
The benefits would never outweigh the costs and, in fact, it was this very problem that

129
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,900
led to the decline of Detroit.

130
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,220
The city was a major center of automobile manufacturing but eventually manufacturers

131
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,840
figured out that they could greatly reduce costs by moving the plants out of the city.

132
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Without a major industry to employ individuals, many moved away and the population has steadily

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,460
declined for the last few decades.

134
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,740
Cities exist because they are efficient.

135
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,180
Nobody's forcing individuals to move to cities, but billions have.

136
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,040
Just imagine there were only ten people in existence and one product that each of them

137
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,280
wanted to buy.

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,920
If they were all equally spread out across this plain, the logical location for a distribution

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,000
hub would be right in the center.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,260
Some individuals would happen to be close to the hub by chance, but overall the product

141
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,360
would have to be shipped a large distance to get to every consumer.

142
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,060
Now let's say that eight of those ten individuals lived together in a mini-city.

143
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,620
The logical location for the distribution hub would then be right by the city.

144
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,960
Shipping for the rural individuals would be slow and expensive, but overall the total

145
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,280
shipping distance and cost to individuals would be lower.

146
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,420
You can see this concept with where Amazon puts their warehouses in the UK.

147
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,060
They could have one enormous warehouse at the geographic center of the country and save

148
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,840
money through economies of scale, but they don't.

149
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,800
They position each of their warehouses near major population centers to reduce the total

150
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,200
shipping distance.

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,340
In our modern context this concept is most easily demonstrated through shipping, but

152
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,740
historically individuals had to purchase nearly all their goods at physical marketplaces.

153
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,500
Even just 200 years ago walking was the primary means of transportation.

154
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,320
In an hour nowadays we can drive 70 miles while in an hour 200 years ago individuals

155
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,660
could walk only three miles so the push to live closer to marketplaces was even higher.

156
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,560
This is why suburbanization is a new concept, but still more individuals than ever choose

157
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,600
to live in cities.

158
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,520
Division and specialization of labor was crucial to the development of our world.

159
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,640
Imagine you made everything you used—you grew your food, you gathered and filtered

160
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,160
your water, you built your own car—just imagine how long it would take you to build

161
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,520
a car from scratch, at least a decade, and yet the average individual in the US can buy

162
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,460
a brand new car from the money that they earn in about six months.

163
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:43,380
That's because there are people better at making cars than you.

164
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,140
There are some people who focus solely on mining iron then some individuals who focus

165
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,740
solely on making glass and so there are thousands of people producing all the different inputs

166
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,420
that go into making your car in the most efficient way possible.

167
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:00,180
Let's say that you, for example, individually can make a pencil in 60 minutes and paper

168
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,460
in 30 while another individual can make a pencil in 30 minutes and paper in 60.

169
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:10,000
In a closed-off world it would take each of you 90 minutes to make a pencil and paper,

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,840
but let's say you make two pieces of paper, which would take you an hour, and the other

171
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,320
individual would make two pencils, which would take them an hour, and then you each trade.

172
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,060
Neither of you have given up anything—you get exactly what you would have gotten by

173
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,780
working independently—but you have each gained time.

174
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,680
This is exactly why trade is beneficial.

175
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,200
Certain people are better at making certain things so by everyone specializing in what

176
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,620
they are good at, the entire world gets more without giving more.

177
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,840
Cities make this trade easier which leads to more of it happening and therefore cities

178
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,320
are efficient.

179
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,140
Humans naturally want to find the path of least resistance and, with our spatial patterns,

180
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,700
the path of least resistance is to all live together.

181
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,600
Of course rural life will always exist and needs to exist, but if you were to have a

182
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,280
hand to pick up and organize every human into the most efficient pattern possible, this

183
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,120
is what it would look like.

184
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,860
Cities don't create wealth and wealth doesn't create cities, but rather cities make wealth

185
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,240
possible.

186
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,500
Cities are efficient and efficiency creates wealth and so people create cities.

187
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,880
If you want to create a website, however, there's no better place than Squarespace.

188
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,520

192
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,740
