7860	11740	The richest country in the world is Qatar, which looks like this.
11740	15580	The second richest country is Luxembourg, which looks like this.
15580	18580	The third richest is Singapore, which looks like this.
18580	24260	The commonality between these three is that each of them has more than 90% of their population
24260	25820	living in cities.
25820	29640	The three poorest countries—the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic
29640	35080	of the Congo, and Burundi—each have urbanization levels below 50%.
35080	39560	Comparing the wealth of African countries and the urbanization levels of African countries,
39560	42080	the maps are nearly identical.
42080	46960	That is not to say that cities automatically create wealth or wealth automatically creates
46960	50920	cities, but there is a direct correlation between the two.
50920	54840	Although, it seems strange that humans would choose to live in cities.
54840	59400	Living costs are higher, air quality is worse, surroundings are more crowded, crime is more
59400	62200	prevalent, and disease is more easily spread.
62200	66560	If the population of the world spread itself out evenly, every single person would have
66560	69640	five acres to live on, but we don't.
69640	74800	We live in a world where half the population lives on just 1% of the land.
74800	80120	54% of the world population now lives in cities and that's significant.
80120	83600	Fifty-five years ago, only half that lived a city life.
83600	89860	The urbanization of the world is changing the world, but why do cities even exist?
89860	92000	Humans were originally hunter-gatherers.
92000	96200	They scavenged for food and often didn't live in a set place, similar to how animals
96200	100460	live, but then in 10,000 BC we learned to farm.
100460	105440	The domestication of plants allowed humans to finally settle down in one singular place
105440	110260	and establish a long-term home, but farming was nothing like it is today.
110260	113760	The humans of the era lacked technology and expertise.
113760	118140	The first archaeological evidence of plowed fields—a process that greatly improves crop
118140	122000	yields—doesn't appear until about 3,000 BC.
122000	126260	It took thousands more years for farmers to successfully domesticate animals like the
126260	127720	ox to pull a plow.
127720	132560	When humans first began farming, nearly every individual had to farm in order to make enough
132560	133780	food to live.
133780	138920	One person's work essentially produced one person's food, but through time as technological
138920	143820	advancements occurred, progressively each individual was able to make more and more
143820	144820	food.
144820	150020	Thanks to that, farmers today each feed 155 people.
150020	155260	The process has also become so efficient that only one acre of land is now needed to feed
155260	159760	one person, but back in the early days of farming, once technology had advanced to the
159760	164260	point where one person made more than one person's food, for the first time ever,
164260	166780	there were some people who didn't need to farm.
166780	169100	And that fact changed humanity.
169100	173680	If that had never happened, we would all still be living in ancient history.
173680	177920	The surplus of food and the development of cities really went hand in hand.
177920	182680	It had never before been possible for humans to live in dense urban conglomerations because
182680	187360	they needed land to farm, but these extra people, freed from farming, were able to work
187360	193220	jobs other than farming which led to languages, literature, science, and really all the technological
193220	196000	advancements that made our modern world.
196000	199980	The spatial patterns of humans really happen quite naturally.
199980	204520	Enough people are each making their decision on where to live that, in aggregate, humans
204520	207060	are going to live in the best places to live.
207060	212300	There's a sort of process of natural selection that happens as billions of humans each pick
212300	214580	their optimal place to live.
214580	219320	Nothing is manufactured about where people live and numbers back this up.
219320	223640	You see, cities tend to stay at the same rank throughout history.
223640	226580	In 1800, the largest city in Europe was London.
226580	229980	Today, the largest city in Europe is still London.
229980	235560	In 1800, the second largest city in Europe was Paris and it too remains second today.
235560	240500	Cities grow, but those that were large in the past tend to stay large—at least without
240500	242340	external influence.
242340	247340	Cities don't just change ranking on their own, they change rank if something else changes.
247340	251820	Hong Kong, for example, changed rank when a change in sovereignty to British drew people
251820	257120	in while with San Francisco the discovery of natural resources, particularly gold, increased
257120	262040	growth rates while with Washington DC, the coming of a new industry, the US government
262040	263280	changed the rank.
263280	268060	If you were to put a pause on all activity but humans moving, rankings would hypothetically
268060	273400	stay exactly the same, but that's not even the best evidence for how natural the existence
273400	274760	of cities is.
274760	279700	According to the US Census Bureau, the largest city in the US is New York with 8.5 million
279700	284240	urban residents, then the second is Los Angeles with 4 million, roughly half as many as New
284240	290580	York, then third is Chicago with 2.7 million, roughly a third, then Houston at 2.3, roughly
290580	294600	a fourth, then Phoenix at 1.6 million, roughly a fifth.
294600	299880	Each city's size is almost exactly determined by the largest city's size divided by its
299880	300880	rank.
300880	305400	It is uncanny how closely city sizes in countries follow this distribution.
305400	307380	It's not just with the US.
307380	313400	Germany's largest city, Berlin, has 3.5 million residents, then Hamburg has 1.8 million,
313400	318580	almost exactly half, then Munich has slightly more than a third at 1.4 million, then Cologne
318580	323760	has just a bit more than a fourth at 1 million, then Frankfurt has almost exactly a fifth
323760	325480	at 700,000.
325480	330080	Now there are anomalies, mostly countries with recent rapid population growth, but in
330080	335100	a large number of countries the ranking of cities can be determined by this law, but
335100	338320	significant is what else can be determined with this law.
338320	342800	If you take a book and rank the frequency of words, it follows this distribution.
342800	347840	If you take a stadium of people and rank them by income, it follows this distribution.
347840	353020	If you take the sounds a dolphin makes and rank them by frequency, it too follows this
353020	354240	distribution.
354240	360720	The link between a distribution found in nature and the size of cities helps prove something—cities
360720	361720	are natural.
361720	367320	Humans will, given time and technological advancement, always form into cities.
367320	372440	The existence of cities can really only happen when the pluses outweigh the minuses.
372440	377000	Back before the food surplus there were few advantages to urbanized living and a huge
377000	382260	disadvantage—a commute to farming land during a time when walking was for most the only
382260	383700	transportation method.
383700	388720	Today, the pluses have increased and keep increasing to the point where day by day more
388720	390740	and more people live in cities.
390740	395160	A major advantage for the existence of cities is the ability for different businesses to
395160	396940	locate near each other.
396940	401060	Part of the reason this is advantageous is that people come to cities to find jobs because
401060	405820	all these businesses are there and so, if businesses want to hire the best people to
405820	408540	be the best, they have to be in cities.
408540	412860	It's a bit of a chicken and the egg problem, but nowadays, different cities tend to play
412860	415900	host to different clusters of businesses.
415900	420900	For example, LA is a hub for the entertainment industry, Boston is a hub for medical research,
420900	425420	Dusseldorf is a hub for the telecommunications industry, and Singapore is a hub for the finance
425420	426420	industry.
426420	430740	In addition to the ability to tap into a common labor pool, businesses cluster because they
430740	434460	want easy access to other businesses.
434460	439020	Telecommunications companies like Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, and AT&T all exist as direct
439020	443340	competitors in Dusseldorf but the reason they are there is because other companies exist
443340	445680	there as well that they can work with.
445680	450080	You and Dusseldorf are companies like Nokia, Google, and LG which each make the phones
450080	453080	that the mobile service providers might stock in their stores.
453080	456880	By all being in the same place, they can more easily collaborate and therefore they can
456880	458840	run their businesses more efficiently.
458840	463120	There's a sort of economies of scale effect when all sorts of companies are all packed
463120	464960	together in one place.
464960	470260	Now, not every business is in a city because there are plenty of cases where the minuses
470260	472080	outweigh the pluses.
472080	476840	You just won't see a car manufacturing plant in downtown Manhattan because it doesn't
476840	477840	make sense.
477840	481800	While there would be advantages such as access to a higher skilled labor pool, proximity
481800	486260	to other businesses, and reduced transport costs by being closer to the final market,
486260	489320	there are significant disadvantages.
489320	494980	Land costs about $38 per square foot in New York so if Tesla, for example, wanted to move
494980	500040	their factory to the city it would cost over $200 million in land alone.
500040	504860	The benefits would never outweigh the costs and, in fact, it was this very problem that
504860	506900	led to the decline of Detroit.
506900	511220	The city was a major center of automobile manufacturing but eventually manufacturers
511220	515840	figured out that they could greatly reduce costs by moving the plants out of the city.
515840	520720	Without a major industry to employ individuals, many moved away and the population has steadily
520720	523460	declined for the last few decades.
523460	525740	Cities exist because they are efficient.
526320	530180	Nobody's forcing individuals to move to cities, but billions have.
530180	534040	Just imagine there were only ten people in existence and one product that each of them
534040	535280	wanted to buy.
535280	539920	If they were all equally spread out across this plain, the logical location for a distribution
539920	542000	hub would be right in the center.
542000	546260	Some individuals would happen to be close to the hub by chance, but overall the product
546260	550360	would have to be shipped a large distance to get to every consumer.
550360	555060	Now let's say that eight of those ten individuals lived together in a mini-city.
555060	559620	The logical location for the distribution hub would then be right by the city.
559620	563960	Shipping for the rural individuals would be slow and expensive, but overall the total
563960	567280	shipping distance and cost to individuals would be lower.
567280	571420	You can see this concept with where Amazon puts their warehouses in the UK.
571420	576060	They could have one enormous warehouse at the geographic center of the country and save
576060	578840	money through economies of scale, but they don't.
578840	583800	They position each of their warehouses near major population centers to reduce the total
583800	585200	shipping distance.
585200	589340	In our modern context this concept is most easily demonstrated through shipping, but
589340	594740	historically individuals had to purchase nearly all their goods at physical marketplaces.
594740	598500	Even just 200 years ago walking was the primary means of transportation.
598500	604320	In an hour nowadays we can drive 70 miles while in an hour 200 years ago individuals
604320	609660	could walk only three miles so the push to live closer to marketplaces was even higher.
609660	614560	This is why suburbanization is a new concept, but still more individuals than ever choose
614560	616600	to live in cities.
616600	621520	Division and specialization of labor was crucial to the development of our world.
621520	625640	Imagine you made everything you used—you grew your food, you gathered and filtered
625640	630160	your water, you built your own car—just imagine how long it would take you to build
630160	635520	a car from scratch, at least a decade, and yet the average individual in the US can buy
635520	639460	a brand new car from the money that they earn in about six months.
639460	643380	That's because there are people better at making cars than you.
643380	647140	There are some people who focus solely on mining iron then some individuals who focus
647140	651740	solely on making glass and so there are thousands of people producing all the different inputs
651740	655420	that go into making your car in the most efficient way possible.
655420	660180	Let's say that you, for example, individually can make a pencil in 60 minutes and paper
660180	665460	in 30 while another individual can make a pencil in 30 minutes and paper in 60.
665460	670000	In a closed-off world it would take each of you 90 minutes to make a pencil and paper,
670000	673840	but let's say you make two pieces of paper, which would take you an hour, and the other
673840	678320	individual would make two pencils, which would take them an hour, and then you each trade.
678320	682060	Neither of you have given up anything—you get exactly what you would have gotten by
682060	685780	working independently—but you have each gained time.
685780	688680	This is exactly why trade is beneficial.
688680	693200	Certain people are better at making certain things so by everyone specializing in what
693200	697620	they are good at, the entire world gets more without giving more.
697620	701840	Cities make this trade easier which leads to more of it happening and therefore cities
701840	703320	are efficient.
703320	708140	Humans naturally want to find the path of least resistance and, with our spatial patterns,
708140	711700	the path of least resistance is to all live together.
711700	715600	Of course rural life will always exist and needs to exist, but if you were to have a
715600	721280	hand to pick up and organize every human into the most efficient pattern possible, this
721280	723120	is what it would look like.
723120	727860	Cities don't create wealth and wealth doesn't create cities, but rather cities make wealth
727860	729240	possible.
729240	734500	Cities are efficient and efficiency creates wealth and so people create cities.
734500	738880	If you want to create a website, however, there's no better place than Squarespace.
