4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,600
In March, 2020, the cruise industry shut down.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,000
There are no qualifiers to that sentence.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,280
It's not that certain ships from certain companies in certain countries shut down—it's

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,840
that every ship, from every company, in every country stopped accepting passengers in March

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,840
2020.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,240
That's… unprecedented.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,060
Never before in modern times has there been such a complete global shutdown of an industry

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,560
of this size.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,040
This isn't like airlines or restaurants or movie theatres—they couldn't keep operating

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:56,780
at a certain level, or with certain precautions, or in certain geographies.

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,140
Every single cruise ship shut down.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,220
The second that happened, though, time started ticking.

16
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,680
Cruise lines were on the clock with the biggest challenge they might ever face—they had

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,380
to survive as organizations with no revenue, no passengers, and little to no government

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,020
support until it was safe and legal to sail again.

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,700
As it turns out, doing nothing, as a company, is actually quite a lot of work.

20
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,020
After ships dropped off their last loads of passengers, thousands of people remained

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,380
on board—the crew.

22
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,960
Naturally, management started to wonder what they should do with them.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,660
At first, the answer was nothing.

24
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,940
You see, as the shutdown started, much of the global cruise fleet was in the Caribbean,

25
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,540
finishing up the peak season before crossing the Atlantic for the summer Mediterranean

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,720
cruise season.

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,540
As most Caribbean cruises leave from the US, that meant that the American CDC's March

28
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,620
14th no-sail order was what officially prevented them from sailing, even if in practice most

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,460
shut down voluntarily.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,440
That no-sail order, however, was initially slated to expire after just 30 days, so most

31
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,380
cruise lines decided to leave their ships staffed and wait it out under the hope that

32
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,960
they could salvage their summer seasons.

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:18,480
On April 9th, though, the CDC extended the order for 100 days until July 24th, making

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,440
it very clear that this would not be a short-term stoppage.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,600
In most cases, cruise lines are subject to the laws of the countries in which they're

36
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,560
registered, which means that most cruise lines register their vessels in countries with loose

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,280
labor laws like Panama, the Bahamas, or Malta.

38
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,920
That typically lets them hire from anywhere, which in practice gives them access to low-wage

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,480
labor pools from places like Eastern Europe or the Philippines.

40
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,000
Now, cruise ships are, of course, massive, and correspondently need a massive number

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,860
of staff to run.

42
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,860
The Carnival Panorama, for example, has a crew size of 1,450 people, and Carnival, its

43
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,240
owner, has some 23 ships.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,100
That meant that, once they decided to officially pull the plug in April 2020, they had some

45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:11,460
26,000 staff members from all around the world who each needed to get home.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,140
In the era of paired-back flight schedules, border closures, and complex testing and quarantine

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,900
protocols, it soon became very clear that finding 26,000 flight itineraries for 26,000

48
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,780
stranded crew members would not be a quick and simple exercise.

49
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,940
So, rather than 26,000 itineraries, they cut it back to just about seven.

50
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,980
In late April, 18 of Carnival's 23 ships started sailing to a spot off the coast of

51
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,620
Grand Bahama Island.

52
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,720
Then, once together, over a few days in early May, some 10,000 crew members shuffled between

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,020
the various ships using tenders.

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,580
The task entailed more or less grouping the crew into geographic regions—South East

55
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,260
Asian crew boarded the Carnival Conquest, South Asian crew boarded the Ecstasy, Eastern

56
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,020
European crew boarded the Magic, and so on and so forth.

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:09,820
Once the crew transfer was completed, on May 4th, seven ships—the Liberty, Dream, Magic,

58
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,220
Breeze, Ecstasy, Conquest, and Glory—left.

59
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,620
The Carnival Glory had the shortest journey of them all—tasked with repatriating many

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,540
of the Caribbean crew members to their homes.

61
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,780
Just five days after departing, it docked in St. Lucia, then the next day in St. Vincent

62
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,220
and the Grenadines, then St. George's, Barbados, and so on and so forth, completing a multi-week

63
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,800
milk run of the West Indies.

64
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,100
Next to complete its mission was the Carnival Breeze, dropping British crew off in Southampton,

65
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,700
while the Carnival Magic made a quick stop in Gibraltar before arriving in Dubrovnik,

66
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,300
Croatia to repatriate much of Carnival's Eastern European crew.

67
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,760
Meanwhile, the journeys of the Liberty, Dream, Conquest, and Ecstasy were just getting started,

68
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,720
as they each stopped at various South African ports to restock, refuel, and drop off African

69
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,960
crew members.

70
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,140
After two weeks of sailing the Indian Ocean, the Dream and Conquest arrived in the waters

71
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,640
off the coast of Denpasar to bring many of the Indonesian crew home, while the Liberty

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,840
arrived in Mumbai, India.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,840
The Dream then made a quick journey west to Jakarta to drop off more of its Indonesian

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,680
crew, just as the Ecstasy made it to Mumbai as well, carrying even more Indian crew members.

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,400
Then, as soon as the Conquest met the Dream in Jakarta, the two sailed together to Manila

76
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,360
to drop off a huge number of Philippine staff members, while the Liberty and Ecstasy sailed

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,600
south to anchor off the coast of Colombo and drop off Sri Lankan crew.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,760
With that, as June turned into July, this repatriation mission was complete, with some

79
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,880
crew having spent two months sailing from the Bahamas to get back home.

80
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,400
While getting these 26,000 crew members off their boats and off their payroll was a major

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,040
concern of management at Carnival once the long-term nature of the shutdown became clear,

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,200
attention, among all cruise line management teams, quickly refocused onto how to actually

83
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,340
survive as a business when there's no business to be made.

84
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,660
In the third quarter of 2019, each of the three largest cruise companies earned billions

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,660
in revenue.

86
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,620
In the same quarter one year later, Carnival earned $31 million in revenue, Norwegian $6.5

87
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,420
million, and Royal Caribbean managed to earn negative $33 million in revenue—something

88
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,020
almost unheard of among large companies.

89
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:29,340
So, how do you survive as a company when you quite literally have no way to make money?

90
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,220
Well, cruise lines did have one thing going for them.

91
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:42,040
Prior to COVID, they were highly, highly profitable—in fact, many often pocketed hundreds of dollars

92
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,680
in profit per passenger.

93
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,820
In addition, cruising is a highly cyclical industry.

94
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,060
What that means is that when the overall economy is good, the cruise business is quite good,

95
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,140
while when the overall economy is bad, the cruise business is quite bad.

96
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:03,940
That's because, when money gets tight for a person, one of the first things to go is

97
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
vacation.

98
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,620
Therefore, cruise lines are used to weathering out leaner times, so they traditionally keep

99
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,780
quite a lot of money in their war chests.

100
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,380
At the end of the third financial quarter of 2020, by which time the companies had unlocked

101
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,580
more liquid assets and passed the initial shock phase of the shutdown, Norwegian Cruise

102
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:27,700
Line Holdings, the third largest cruise conglomerate in the world, had some $2.4 billion in the

103
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
bank.

104
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:34,260
Meanwhile, the Royal Caribbean Group had about $3 billion in cash, while the Carnival Corporation,

105
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,660
by far the largest cruise company in the world, held about $8.2 billion in cash.

106
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,740
That's what's referred to as their runway, and the task was to get their burn rate—how

107
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,200
much they spend per day to stay in existence—to its lowest possible level.

108
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,880
In the case of Carnival, if they spent $50 million per day, for example, they would only

109
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,320
survive some 164 days without revenue.

110
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,140
If they were able to get that down to only $25 million a day, though, they'd have 328

111
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,440
days—almost a year—of runway.

112
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,160
Once the long-term nature of the shutdown became clear, furloughing or firing almost

113
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,880
all on-ship staff and a sizable chunk of onshore staff was an easy decision for cruise ship

114
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,120
management.

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,840
One of the tougher decisions was what to do with their key assets—the ships.

116
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,740
Unlike people, they couldn't just let them go.

117
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,760
In the case of Carnival, their oldest, smallest, and cheapest ship, the Ecstasy, cost some

118
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,840
$275 million to build back in 1991.

119
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,320
Nowadays, they're building $780 million ships like the Carnival Panorama.

120
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,520
And altogether, this means a cruise line's fleet is incredibly valuable, and since the

121
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,720
ships weren't carrying passengers around the world, they had to put them somewhere.

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,080
However, as it turns out, both the world's cruise ports and the world's cruise ships

123
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,740
weren't built with a total industry shutdown in mind.

124
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,840
First of all, you can't just turn off a cruise ship, tie it up, and lock the door

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,960
behind you.

126
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,000
With very little exception, from the moment a ship enters service to the moment it's

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,680
decommissioned, there are people on board as these massive machines require constant

128
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,240
monitoring and maintenance to stay in working order.

129
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,600
In addition, cruise ports were built to suit the need, and since the early days of the

130
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,960
industry, the need has been for ships to stop every week or so to unload passengers, restock,

131
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,960
and load back up.

132
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,400
They're designed for the majority of ships to be at sea, which historically was fine,

133
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,080
because the majority of ships were always at sea.

134
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,760
Now, however, that means there just isn't enough space in the world's cruise ports

135
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,280
for every cruise ship to tie up and wait things out.

136
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,420
In fact, there's not even close to enough space, and most ports charge ships tens of

137
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,400
thousands of dollars per day to tie up, so the vast majority of the world's cruise

138
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,320
fleet is out at sea, floating around.

139
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,600
They each now carry an average of about 100 crew members—a fraction of their normal

140
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,320
staffing levels—performing the most essential functions—navigation, maintenance, engineering,

141
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,840
food preparation, medical care, and more.

142
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,560
In the case of Carnival, 15 of their 23 ships are currently anchored off the coast of the

143
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,520
Bahamas, and about once a week, one of them will sail to Miami to pick up food, mail,

144
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,800
and other supplies, which they then transfer between the ships upon return.

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,400
Most lines are operating with some version of this floating-cluster approach, as it's

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,000
clearly one of the lowest-cost methods for storage that keeps ships in an adequate state

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,720
of readiness for when cruising finally returns.

148
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,720
And that's the key question right now—when will it be possible for cruising to return?

149
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,960
In summer 2020, some thought the answer was then.

150
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,180
Particularly in Europe, which had a robust summer travel season, quite a few smaller

151
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,040
cruise ships and even some larger ones brought passengers back on board with precautions.

152
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,440
In general, this meant the ships were capacity-capped and passengers had to be tested before boarding,

153
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,520
were subject to temperature checks, were required to wear a mask in communal areas, and could

154
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,360
only go ashore on managed excursions.

155
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,060
With these and other rules, cruise companies thought they might have cracked the code of

156
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,640
sailing safely and profitably during a pandemic, but then reality hit.

157
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,380
On the MS Roald Amundsen, an expedition cruise ship that typically carries 500 or so passengers

158
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,260
through the Arctic or Antarctic, 62 people tested positive for COVID after a trip around

159
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,100
Svalbard, putting stress on the contact tracing system of northern Norway.

160
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,820
Elsewhere in Norway, the Seadream 1 had to cancel a cruise after a positive COVID test,

161
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,160
and then a few months later, the very same ship left Barbados on the very first cruise

162
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,700
in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic, which soon had to be cancelled due to nine

163
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,660
passengers and crew testing positive.

164
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,300
On the other side of the continent, UnCruise Adventures left Juneau in early August on

165
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,980
the very first cruise with passengers from an American port since March, 2020, until

166
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:14,280
a passenger's test came back positive, forcing them to return to port, put all passengers

167
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,340
under quarantine, and cancel the rest of the season.

168
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,220
This is the reality of cruising during a pandemic.

169
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,460
As long as passengers are originating from a place with rampant community spread, no

170
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,140
matter how many precautions are taken, it doesn't work from a public health perspective,

171
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:35,900
it doesn't work from a business perspective, it just simply doesn't work.

172
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,980
Therefore, for the most part, even in the cases where governments weren't stopping

173
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,180
them, cruise lines stopped trying.

174
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:50,140
Nowadays, however, in spring 2021, tens of millions of COVID vaccines are entering people's

175
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:55,440
arms every day around the world, and a solution has arisen.

176
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,560
Instead of trying to prevent COVID from spreading on their ships, the cruise lines are simply

177
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:04,060
going to prevent people who could have COVID from getting on their ships.

178
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,640
Many of the major players, including Royal Caribbean, are requiring all adult passengers

179
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,280
to be fully vaccinated before boarding.

180
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,760
Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, having a fully vaccinated ship means that

181
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,240
even if someone does board with COVID, this will not set off a chain reaction of community

182
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,240
spread throughout the entire vessel.

183
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,200
Given these new policies, cruise lines are reworking their schedules to center their

184
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,280
business on the places where vaccines are rolling out the fastest.

185
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,640
For example, with less than two months notice, Royal Caribbean announced that it would be

186
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,940
sailing from Israel, home of the world's fastest vaccination campaign, for the first

187
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,820
time ever with one of the largest cruise ships in the world—the Odyssey of the Seas.

188
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,320
In addition, while the summer cruise season is traditionally centered on the Mediterranean,

189
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,480
in 2021, many of the first cruises to restart will be based out of the Caribbean, in close

190
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,200
proximity to the US, which has also had one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns.

191
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,840
Cruise lines have, for the most part, succeeded with their grand challenge.

192
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:14,360
At the end of 2020, Royal Caribbean, for example, still had $3.6 billion in the bank, as runway,

193
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,100
and had pushed their burn rate down to $270 million a month.

194
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,660
That means they can survive without revenue until at least February 9th, 2022.

195
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,380
Norwegian Cruise Line, meanwhile, had enough to make it until April 25th, 2022, while Carnival

196
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,060
had enough to last till June 9th, 2022.

197
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,880
The cruise lines will be fine.

198
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,140
But there is another side to the equation.

199
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:46,060
While cruise lines are typically massive global enterprises, they rely on the places they

200
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
visit.

201
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,380
They rely on all the small businesses that operate tours and excursions for passengers

202
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,860
at each port of call—specifically, they rely on places like Ketchikan, Alaska.

203
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,380
Last summer, under strict COVID protocols, I traveled there with a film crew to document

204
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:08,060
a summer like no other—a summer where the 1.2 million annual cruise tourists that keep

205
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,300
the economy of this small town of 8,000 alive just didn't show up.

206
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,180
Two summers ago, Ketchikan was one of the most sought-after cruise destinations in the

207
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,920
world—they would quite literally run out of space on the docks.

208
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,420
Last summer, they were experiencing the most acute form of economic ruin.

209
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:33,500
The documentary I made, profiling this, is out now, exclusively on Nebula.

210
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,380
It's the first on-location project we've released in almost a year, and I think you'll

211
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,740

narrow-gauge steam railway in China, connecting an area without cars, buses, or even roads

218
