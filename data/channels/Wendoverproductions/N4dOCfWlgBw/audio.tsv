15500	20600	In March, 2020, the cruise industry shut down.
20600	23000	There are no qualifiers to that sentence.
23000	28280	It's not that certain ships from certain companies in certain countries shut down—it's
28280	34840	that every ship, from every company, in every country stopped accepting passengers in March
34840	36840	2020.
36840	40240	That's… unprecedented.
40240	46060	Never before in modern times has there been such a complete global shutdown of an industry
46060	47560	of this size.
47560	52040	This isn't like airlines or restaurants or movie theatres—they couldn't keep operating
52040	56780	at a certain level, or with certain precautions, or in certain geographies.
56780	60140	Every single cruise ship shut down.
60140	64220	The second that happened, though, time started ticking.
64220	68680	Cruise lines were on the clock with the biggest challenge they might ever face—they had
68680	74380	to survive as organizations with no revenue, no passengers, and little to no government
74380	79020	support until it was safe and legal to sail again.
79020	85700	As it turns out, doing nothing, as a company, is actually quite a lot of work.
85700	90020	After ships dropped off their last loads of passengers, thousands of people remained
90020	92380	on board—the crew.
92380	95960	Naturally, management started to wonder what they should do with them.
95960	98660	At first, the answer was nothing.
98660	103940	You see, as the shutdown started, much of the global cruise fleet was in the Caribbean,
103940	107540	finishing up the peak season before crossing the Atlantic for the summer Mediterranean
107540	108720	cruise season.
108720	113540	As most Caribbean cruises leave from the US, that meant that the American CDC's March
113540	118620	14th no-sail order was what officially prevented them from sailing, even if in practice most
118620	120460	shut down voluntarily.
120460	125440	That no-sail order, however, was initially slated to expire after just 30 days, so most
125440	129380	cruise lines decided to leave their ships staffed and wait it out under the hope that
129380	131960	they could salvage their summer seasons.
131960	138480	On April 9th, though, the CDC extended the order for 100 days until July 24th, making
138480	143440	it very clear that this would not be a short-term stoppage.
143440	147600	In most cases, cruise lines are subject to the laws of the countries in which they're
147600	151560	registered, which means that most cruise lines register their vessels in countries with loose
151560	155280	labor laws like Panama, the Bahamas, or Malta.
155280	159920	That typically lets them hire from anywhere, which in practice gives them access to low-wage
159920	163480	labor pools from places like Eastern Europe or the Philippines.
163480	169000	Now, cruise ships are, of course, massive, and correspondently need a massive number
169000	170860	of staff to run.
170860	176860	The Carnival Panorama, for example, has a crew size of 1,450 people, and Carnival, its
176860	180240	owner, has some 23 ships.
180240	185100	That meant that, once they decided to officially pull the plug in April 2020, they had some
185100	191460	26,000 staff members from all around the world who each needed to get home.
191460	196140	In the era of paired-back flight schedules, border closures, and complex testing and quarantine
196140	202900	protocols, it soon became very clear that finding 26,000 flight itineraries for 26,000
202900	207780	stranded crew members would not be a quick and simple exercise.
207780	215940	So, rather than 26,000 itineraries, they cut it back to just about seven.
215940	220980	In late April, 18 of Carnival's 23 ships started sailing to a spot off the coast of
220980	222620	Grand Bahama Island.
222620	228720	Then, once together, over a few days in early May, some 10,000 crew members shuffled between
228720	231020	the various ships using tenders.
231020	235580	The task entailed more or less grouping the crew into geographic regions—South East
235580	240260	Asian crew boarded the Carnival Conquest, South Asian crew boarded the Ecstasy, Eastern
240260	244020	European crew boarded the Magic, and so on and so forth.
244020	249820	Once the crew transfer was completed, on May 4th, seven ships—the Liberty, Dream, Magic,
249820	253220	Breeze, Ecstasy, Conquest, and Glory—left.
253220	257620	The Carnival Glory had the shortest journey of them all—tasked with repatriating many
257620	260540	of the Caribbean crew members to their homes.
260540	264780	Just five days after departing, it docked in St. Lucia, then the next day in St. Vincent
264780	270220	and the Grenadines, then St. George's, Barbados, and so on and so forth, completing a multi-week
270220	272800	milk run of the West Indies.
272800	277100	Next to complete its mission was the Carnival Breeze, dropping British crew off in Southampton,
277100	281700	while the Carnival Magic made a quick stop in Gibraltar before arriving in Dubrovnik,
281700	285300	Croatia to repatriate much of Carnival's Eastern European crew.
285300	290760	Meanwhile, the journeys of the Liberty, Dream, Conquest, and Ecstasy were just getting started,
290760	295720	as they each stopped at various South African ports to restock, refuel, and drop off African
295720	296960	crew members.
296960	301140	After two weeks of sailing the Indian Ocean, the Dream and Conquest arrived in the waters
301140	305640	off the coast of Denpasar to bring many of the Indonesian crew home, while the Liberty
305640	307840	arrived in Mumbai, India.
307840	311840	The Dream then made a quick journey west to Jakarta to drop off more of its Indonesian
311840	317680	crew, just as the Ecstasy made it to Mumbai as well, carrying even more Indian crew members.
317680	322400	Then, as soon as the Conquest met the Dream in Jakarta, the two sailed together to Manila
322400	327360	to drop off a huge number of Philippine staff members, while the Liberty and Ecstasy sailed
327360	331600	south to anchor off the coast of Colombo and drop off Sri Lankan crew.
331600	336760	With that, as June turned into July, this repatriation mission was complete, with some
336760	342880	crew having spent two months sailing from the Bahamas to get back home.
342880	347400	While getting these 26,000 crew members off their boats and off their payroll was a major
347400	352040	concern of management at Carnival once the long-term nature of the shutdown became clear,
352040	357200	attention, among all cruise line management teams, quickly refocused onto how to actually
357200	361340	survive as a business when there's no business to be made.
361340	366660	In the third quarter of 2019, each of the three largest cruise companies earned billions
366660	367660	in revenue.
367660	373620	In the same quarter one year later, Carnival earned $31 million in revenue, Norwegian $6.5
373620	379420	million, and Royal Caribbean managed to earn negative $33 million in revenue—something
379420	382020	almost unheard of among large companies.
382020	389340	So, how do you survive as a company when you quite literally have no way to make money?
389340	394220	Well, cruise lines did have one thing going for them.
394220	402040	Prior to COVID, they were highly, highly profitable—in fact, many often pocketed hundreds of dollars
402040	404680	in profit per passenger.
404680	408820	In addition, cruising is a highly cyclical industry.
408820	414060	What that means is that when the overall economy is good, the cruise business is quite good,
414060	418140	while when the overall economy is bad, the cruise business is quite bad.
418140	423940	That's because, when money gets tight for a person, one of the first things to go is
423940	424940	vacation.
424940	429620	Therefore, cruise lines are used to weathering out leaner times, so they traditionally keep
429620	432780	quite a lot of money in their war chests.
432780	437380	At the end of the third financial quarter of 2020, by which time the companies had unlocked
437380	441580	more liquid assets and passed the initial shock phase of the shutdown, Norwegian Cruise
441580	447700	Line Holdings, the third largest cruise conglomerate in the world, had some $2.4 billion in the
447700	448700	bank.
448700	454260	Meanwhile, the Royal Caribbean Group had about $3 billion in cash, while the Carnival Corporation,
454260	459660	by far the largest cruise company in the world, held about $8.2 billion in cash.
459660	464740	That's what's referred to as their runway, and the task was to get their burn rate—how
464740	470200	much they spend per day to stay in existence—to its lowest possible level.
470200	474880	In the case of Carnival, if they spent $50 million per day, for example, they would only
474880	478320	survive some 164 days without revenue.
478320	484140	If they were able to get that down to only $25 million a day, though, they'd have 328
484140	487440	days—almost a year—of runway.
487440	492160	Once the long-term nature of the shutdown became clear, furloughing or firing almost
492160	497880	all on-ship staff and a sizable chunk of onshore staff was an easy decision for cruise ship
497880	499120	management.
499120	504840	One of the tougher decisions was what to do with their key assets—the ships.
504840	507740	Unlike people, they couldn't just let them go.
507740	513760	In the case of Carnival, their oldest, smallest, and cheapest ship, the Ecstasy, cost some
513760	518840	$275 million to build back in 1991.
518840	525320	Nowadays, they're building $780 million ships like the Carnival Panorama.
525320	530520	And altogether, this means a cruise line's fleet is incredibly valuable, and since the
530520	535720	ships weren't carrying passengers around the world, they had to put them somewhere.
535720	541080	However, as it turns out, both the world's cruise ports and the world's cruise ships
541080	545740	weren't built with a total industry shutdown in mind.
545740	549840	First of all, you can't just turn off a cruise ship, tie it up, and lock the door
549840	550960	behind you.
550960	556000	With very little exception, from the moment a ship enters service to the moment it's
556000	560680	decommissioned, there are people on board as these massive machines require constant
560680	564240	monitoring and maintenance to stay in working order.
564240	568600	In addition, cruise ports were built to suit the need, and since the early days of the
568600	573960	industry, the need has been for ships to stop every week or so to unload passengers, restock,
573960	574960	and load back up.
574960	579400	They're designed for the majority of ships to be at sea, which historically was fine,
579400	582080	because the majority of ships were always at sea.
582080	586760	Now, however, that means there just isn't enough space in the world's cruise ports
586760	590280	for every cruise ship to tie up and wait things out.
590280	595420	In fact, there's not even close to enough space, and most ports charge ships tens of
595420	600400	thousands of dollars per day to tie up, so the vast majority of the world's cruise
600400	603320	fleet is out at sea, floating around.
603320	608600	They each now carry an average of about 100 crew members—a fraction of their normal
608600	614320	staffing levels—performing the most essential functions—navigation, maintenance, engineering,
614320	616840	food preparation, medical care, and more.
616840	621560	In the case of Carnival, 15 of their 23 ships are currently anchored off the coast of the
621560	626520	Bahamas, and about once a week, one of them will sail to Miami to pick up food, mail,
626520	630800	and other supplies, which they then transfer between the ships upon return.
630800	635400	Most lines are operating with some version of this floating-cluster approach, as it's
635400	640000	clearly one of the lowest-cost methods for storage that keeps ships in an adequate state
640000	643720	of readiness for when cruising finally returns.
643720	650720	And that's the key question right now—when will it be possible for cruising to return?
650720	654960	In summer 2020, some thought the answer was then.
654960	659180	Particularly in Europe, which had a robust summer travel season, quite a few smaller
659180	665040	cruise ships and even some larger ones brought passengers back on board with precautions.
665040	670440	In general, this meant the ships were capacity-capped and passengers had to be tested before boarding,
670440	674520	were subject to temperature checks, were required to wear a mask in communal areas, and could
674520	677360	only go ashore on managed excursions.
677360	681060	With these and other rules, cruise companies thought they might have cracked the code of
681060	687640	sailing safely and profitably during a pandemic, but then reality hit.
687640	692380	On the MS Roald Amundsen, an expedition cruise ship that typically carries 500 or so passengers
692380	698260	through the Arctic or Antarctic, 62 people tested positive for COVID after a trip around
698260	703100	Svalbard, putting stress on the contact tracing system of northern Norway.
703100	707820	Elsewhere in Norway, the Seadream 1 had to cancel a cruise after a positive COVID test,
707820	713160	and then a few months later, the very same ship left Barbados on the very first cruise
713160	717700	in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic, which soon had to be cancelled due to nine
717700	720660	passengers and crew testing positive.
720660	725300	On the other side of the continent, UnCruise Adventures left Juneau in early August on
725300	729980	the very first cruise with passengers from an American port since March, 2020, until
729980	734280	a passenger's test came back positive, forcing them to return to port, put all passengers
734280	738340	under quarantine, and cancel the rest of the season.
738340	742220	This is the reality of cruising during a pandemic.
742220	746460	As long as passengers are originating from a place with rampant community spread, no
746460	751140	matter how many precautions are taken, it doesn't work from a public health perspective,
751140	755900	it doesn't work from a business perspective, it just simply doesn't work.
755900	759980	Therefore, for the most part, even in the cases where governments weren't stopping
759980	763180	them, cruise lines stopped trying.
763180	770140	Nowadays, however, in spring 2021, tens of millions of COVID vaccines are entering people's
770140	775440	arms every day around the world, and a solution has arisen.
775440	779560	Instead of trying to prevent COVID from spreading on their ships, the cruise lines are simply
779560	784060	going to prevent people who could have COVID from getting on their ships.
784060	788640	Many of the major players, including Royal Caribbean, are requiring all adult passengers
788640	791280	to be fully vaccinated before boarding.
791280	796760	Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, having a fully vaccinated ship means that
796760	802240	even if someone does board with COVID, this will not set off a chain reaction of community
802240	805240	spread throughout the entire vessel.
805240	809200	Given these new policies, cruise lines are reworking their schedules to center their
809200	813280	business on the places where vaccines are rolling out the fastest.
813280	817640	For example, with less than two months notice, Royal Caribbean announced that it would be
817640	821940	sailing from Israel, home of the world's fastest vaccination campaign, for the first
821940	826820	time ever with one of the largest cruise ships in the world—the Odyssey of the Seas.
826820	831320	In addition, while the summer cruise season is traditionally centered on the Mediterranean,
831320	836480	in 2021, many of the first cruises to restart will be based out of the Caribbean, in close
836480	842200	proximity to the US, which has also had one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns.
842200	846840	Cruise lines have, for the most part, succeeded with their grand challenge.
846840	854360	At the end of 2020, Royal Caribbean, for example, still had $3.6 billion in the bank, as runway,
854360	859100	and had pushed their burn rate down to $270 million a month.
859100	864660	That means they can survive without revenue until at least February 9th, 2022.
864660	870380	Norwegian Cruise Line, meanwhile, had enough to make it until April 25th, 2022, while Carnival
870380	874060	had enough to last till June 9th, 2022.
874060	876880	The cruise lines will be fine.
876880	880140	But there is another side to the equation.
880140	886060	While cruise lines are typically massive global enterprises, they rely on the places they
886060	887060	visit.
887060	891380	They rely on all the small businesses that operate tours and excursions for passengers
891380	897860	at each port of call—specifically, they rely on places like Ketchikan, Alaska.
897860	902380	Last summer, under strict COVID protocols, I traveled there with a film crew to document
902380	908060	a summer like no other—a summer where the 1.2 million annual cruise tourists that keep
908060	913300	the economy of this small town of 8,000 alive just didn't show up.
913300	918180	Two summers ago, Ketchikan was one of the most sought-after cruise destinations in the
918180	922920	world—they would quite literally run out of space on the docks.
922920	928420	Last summer, they were experiencing the most acute form of economic ruin.
928420	933500	The documentary I made, profiling this, is out now, exclusively on Nebula.
933500	938380	It's the first on-location project we've released in almost a year, and I think you'll
