00:15.500 --> 00:20.600
In March, 2020, the cruise industry shut down.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.000
There are no qualifiers to that sentence.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.280
It's not that certain ships from certain companies in certain countries shut down—it's

00:28.280 --> 00:34.840
that every ship, from every company, in every country stopped accepting passengers in March

00:34.840 --> 00:36.840
2020.

00:36.840 --> 00:40.240
That's… unprecedented.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.060
Never before in modern times has there been such a complete global shutdown of an industry

00:46.060 --> 00:47.560
of this size.

00:47.560 --> 00:52.040
This isn't like airlines or restaurants or movie theatres—they couldn't keep operating

00:52.040 --> 00:56.780
at a certain level, or with certain precautions, or in certain geographies.

00:56.780 --> 01:00.140
Every single cruise ship shut down.

01:00.140 --> 01:04.220
The second that happened, though, time started ticking.

01:04.220 --> 01:08.680
Cruise lines were on the clock with the biggest challenge they might ever face—they had

01:08.680 --> 01:14.380
to survive as organizations with no revenue, no passengers, and little to no government

01:14.380 --> 01:19.020
support until it was safe and legal to sail again.

01:19.020 --> 01:25.700
As it turns out, doing nothing, as a company, is actually quite a lot of work.

01:25.700 --> 01:30.020
After ships dropped off their last loads of passengers, thousands of people remained

01:30.020 --> 01:32.380
on board—the crew.

01:32.380 --> 01:35.960
Naturally, management started to wonder what they should do with them.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.660
At first, the answer was nothing.

01:38.660 --> 01:43.940
You see, as the shutdown started, much of the global cruise fleet was in the Caribbean,

01:43.940 --> 01:47.540
finishing up the peak season before crossing the Atlantic for the summer Mediterranean

01:47.540 --> 01:48.720
cruise season.

01:48.720 --> 01:53.540
As most Caribbean cruises leave from the US, that meant that the American CDC's March

01:53.540 --> 01:58.620
14th no-sail order was what officially prevented them from sailing, even if in practice most

01:58.620 --> 02:00.460
shut down voluntarily.

02:00.460 --> 02:05.440
That no-sail order, however, was initially slated to expire after just 30 days, so most

02:05.440 --> 02:09.380
cruise lines decided to leave their ships staffed and wait it out under the hope that

02:09.380 --> 02:11.960
they could salvage their summer seasons.

02:11.960 --> 02:18.480
On April 9th, though, the CDC extended the order for 100 days until July 24th, making

02:18.480 --> 02:23.440
it very clear that this would not be a short-term stoppage.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.600
In most cases, cruise lines are subject to the laws of the countries in which they're

02:27.600 --> 02:31.560
registered, which means that most cruise lines register their vessels in countries with loose

02:31.560 --> 02:35.280
labor laws like Panama, the Bahamas, or Malta.

02:35.280 --> 02:39.920
That typically lets them hire from anywhere, which in practice gives them access to low-wage

02:39.920 --> 02:43.480
labor pools from places like Eastern Europe or the Philippines.

02:43.480 --> 02:49.000
Now, cruise ships are, of course, massive, and correspondently need a massive number

02:49.000 --> 02:50.860
of staff to run.

02:50.860 --> 02:56.860
The Carnival Panorama, for example, has a crew size of 1,450 people, and Carnival, its

02:56.860 --> 03:00.240
owner, has some 23 ships.

03:00.240 --> 03:05.100
That meant that, once they decided to officially pull the plug in April 2020, they had some

03:05.100 --> 03:11.460
26,000 staff members from all around the world who each needed to get home.

03:11.460 --> 03:16.140
In the era of paired-back flight schedules, border closures, and complex testing and quarantine

03:16.140 --> 03:22.900
protocols, it soon became very clear that finding 26,000 flight itineraries for 26,000

03:22.900 --> 03:27.780
stranded crew members would not be a quick and simple exercise.

03:27.780 --> 03:35.940
So, rather than 26,000 itineraries, they cut it back to just about seven.

03:35.940 --> 03:40.980
In late April, 18 of Carnival's 23 ships started sailing to a spot off the coast of

03:40.980 --> 03:42.620
Grand Bahama Island.

03:42.620 --> 03:48.720
Then, once together, over a few days in early May, some 10,000 crew members shuffled between

03:48.720 --> 03:51.020
the various ships using tenders.

03:51.020 --> 03:55.580
The task entailed more or less grouping the crew into geographic regions—South East

03:55.580 --> 04:00.260
Asian crew boarded the Carnival Conquest, South Asian crew boarded the Ecstasy, Eastern

04:00.260 --> 04:04.020
European crew boarded the Magic, and so on and so forth.

04:04.020 --> 04:09.820
Once the crew transfer was completed, on May 4th, seven ships—the Liberty, Dream, Magic,

04:09.820 --> 04:13.220
Breeze, Ecstasy, Conquest, and Glory—left.

04:13.220 --> 04:17.620
The Carnival Glory had the shortest journey of them all—tasked with repatriating many

04:17.620 --> 04:20.540
of the Caribbean crew members to their homes.

04:20.540 --> 04:24.780
Just five days after departing, it docked in St. Lucia, then the next day in St. Vincent

04:24.780 --> 04:30.220
and the Grenadines, then St. George's, Barbados, and so on and so forth, completing a multi-week

04:30.220 --> 04:32.800
milk run of the West Indies.

04:32.800 --> 04:37.100
Next to complete its mission was the Carnival Breeze, dropping British crew off in Southampton,

04:37.100 --> 04:41.700
while the Carnival Magic made a quick stop in Gibraltar before arriving in Dubrovnik,

04:41.700 --> 04:45.300
Croatia to repatriate much of Carnival's Eastern European crew.

04:45.300 --> 04:50.760
Meanwhile, the journeys of the Liberty, Dream, Conquest, and Ecstasy were just getting started,

04:50.760 --> 04:55.720
as they each stopped at various South African ports to restock, refuel, and drop off African

04:55.720 --> 04:56.960
crew members.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.140
After two weeks of sailing the Indian Ocean, the Dream and Conquest arrived in the waters

05:01.140 --> 05:05.640
off the coast of Denpasar to bring many of the Indonesian crew home, while the Liberty

05:05.640 --> 05:07.840
arrived in Mumbai, India.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.840
The Dream then made a quick journey west to Jakarta to drop off more of its Indonesian

05:11.840 --> 05:17.680
crew, just as the Ecstasy made it to Mumbai as well, carrying even more Indian crew members.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.400
Then, as soon as the Conquest met the Dream in Jakarta, the two sailed together to Manila

05:22.400 --> 05:27.360
to drop off a huge number of Philippine staff members, while the Liberty and Ecstasy sailed

05:27.360 --> 05:31.600
south to anchor off the coast of Colombo and drop off Sri Lankan crew.

05:31.600 --> 05:36.760
With that, as June turned into July, this repatriation mission was complete, with some

05:36.760 --> 05:42.880
crew having spent two months sailing from the Bahamas to get back home.

05:42.880 --> 05:47.400
While getting these 26,000 crew members off their boats and off their payroll was a major

05:47.400 --> 05:52.040
concern of management at Carnival once the long-term nature of the shutdown became clear,

05:52.040 --> 05:57.200
attention, among all cruise line management teams, quickly refocused onto how to actually

05:57.200 --> 06:01.340
survive as a business when there's no business to be made.

06:01.340 --> 06:06.660
In the third quarter of 2019, each of the three largest cruise companies earned billions

06:06.660 --> 06:07.660
in revenue.

06:07.660 --> 06:13.620
In the same quarter one year later, Carnival earned $31 million in revenue, Norwegian $6.5

06:13.620 --> 06:19.420
million, and Royal Caribbean managed to earn negative $33 million in revenue—something

06:19.420 --> 06:22.020
almost unheard of among large companies.

06:22.020 --> 06:29.340
So, how do you survive as a company when you quite literally have no way to make money?

06:29.340 --> 06:34.220
Well, cruise lines did have one thing going for them.

06:34.220 --> 06:42.040
Prior to COVID, they were highly, highly profitable—in fact, many often pocketed hundreds of dollars

06:42.040 --> 06:44.680
in profit per passenger.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.820
In addition, cruising is a highly cyclical industry.

06:48.820 --> 06:54.060
What that means is that when the overall economy is good, the cruise business is quite good,

06:54.060 --> 06:58.140
while when the overall economy is bad, the cruise business is quite bad.

06:58.140 --> 07:03.940
That's because, when money gets tight for a person, one of the first things to go is

07:03.940 --> 07:04.940
vacation.

07:04.940 --> 07:09.620
Therefore, cruise lines are used to weathering out leaner times, so they traditionally keep

07:09.620 --> 07:12.780
quite a lot of money in their war chests.

07:12.780 --> 07:17.380
At the end of the third financial quarter of 2020, by which time the companies had unlocked

07:17.380 --> 07:21.580
more liquid assets and passed the initial shock phase of the shutdown, Norwegian Cruise

07:21.580 --> 07:27.700
Line Holdings, the third largest cruise conglomerate in the world, had some $2.4 billion in the

07:27.700 --> 07:28.700
bank.

07:28.700 --> 07:34.260
Meanwhile, the Royal Caribbean Group had about $3 billion in cash, while the Carnival Corporation,

07:34.260 --> 07:39.660
by far the largest cruise company in the world, held about $8.2 billion in cash.

07:39.660 --> 07:44.740
That's what's referred to as their runway, and the task was to get their burn rate—how

07:44.740 --> 07:50.200
much they spend per day to stay in existence—to its lowest possible level.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.880
In the case of Carnival, if they spent $50 million per day, for example, they would only

07:54.880 --> 07:58.320
survive some 164 days without revenue.

07:58.320 --> 08:04.140
If they were able to get that down to only $25 million a day, though, they'd have 328

08:04.140 --> 08:07.440
days—almost a year—of runway.

08:07.440 --> 08:12.160
Once the long-term nature of the shutdown became clear, furloughing or firing almost

08:12.160 --> 08:17.880
all on-ship staff and a sizable chunk of onshore staff was an easy decision for cruise ship

08:17.880 --> 08:19.120
management.

08:19.120 --> 08:24.840
One of the tougher decisions was what to do with their key assets—the ships.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.740
Unlike people, they couldn't just let them go.

08:27.740 --> 08:33.760
In the case of Carnival, their oldest, smallest, and cheapest ship, the Ecstasy, cost some

08:33.760 --> 08:38.840
$275 million to build back in 1991.

08:38.840 --> 08:45.320
Nowadays, they're building $780 million ships like the Carnival Panorama.

08:45.320 --> 08:50.520
And altogether, this means a cruise line's fleet is incredibly valuable, and since the

08:50.520 --> 08:55.720
ships weren't carrying passengers around the world, they had to put them somewhere.

08:55.720 --> 09:01.080
However, as it turns out, both the world's cruise ports and the world's cruise ships

09:01.080 --> 09:05.740
weren't built with a total industry shutdown in mind.

09:05.740 --> 09:09.840
First of all, you can't just turn off a cruise ship, tie it up, and lock the door

09:09.840 --> 09:10.960
behind you.

09:10.960 --> 09:16.000
With very little exception, from the moment a ship enters service to the moment it's

09:16.000 --> 09:20.680
decommissioned, there are people on board as these massive machines require constant

09:20.680 --> 09:24.240
monitoring and maintenance to stay in working order.

09:24.240 --> 09:28.600
In addition, cruise ports were built to suit the need, and since the early days of the

09:28.600 --> 09:33.960
industry, the need has been for ships to stop every week or so to unload passengers, restock,

09:33.960 --> 09:34.960
and load back up.

09:34.960 --> 09:39.400
They're designed for the majority of ships to be at sea, which historically was fine,

09:39.400 --> 09:42.080
because the majority of ships were always at sea.

09:42.080 --> 09:46.760
Now, however, that means there just isn't enough space in the world's cruise ports

09:46.760 --> 09:50.280
for every cruise ship to tie up and wait things out.

09:50.280 --> 09:55.420
In fact, there's not even close to enough space, and most ports charge ships tens of

09:55.420 --> 10:00.400
thousands of dollars per day to tie up, so the vast majority of the world's cruise

10:00.400 --> 10:03.320
fleet is out at sea, floating around.

10:03.320 --> 10:08.600
They each now carry an average of about 100 crew members—a fraction of their normal

10:08.600 --> 10:14.320
staffing levels—performing the most essential functions—navigation, maintenance, engineering,

10:14.320 --> 10:16.840
food preparation, medical care, and more.

10:16.840 --> 10:21.560
In the case of Carnival, 15 of their 23 ships are currently anchored off the coast of the

10:21.560 --> 10:26.520
Bahamas, and about once a week, one of them will sail to Miami to pick up food, mail,

10:26.520 --> 10:30.800
and other supplies, which they then transfer between the ships upon return.

10:30.800 --> 10:35.400
Most lines are operating with some version of this floating-cluster approach, as it's

10:35.400 --> 10:40.000
clearly one of the lowest-cost methods for storage that keeps ships in an adequate state

10:40.000 --> 10:43.720
of readiness for when cruising finally returns.

10:43.720 --> 10:50.720
And that's the key question right now—when will it be possible for cruising to return?

10:50.720 --> 10:54.960
In summer 2020, some thought the answer was then.

10:54.960 --> 10:59.180
Particularly in Europe, which had a robust summer travel season, quite a few smaller

10:59.180 --> 11:05.040
cruise ships and even some larger ones brought passengers back on board with precautions.

11:05.040 --> 11:10.440
In general, this meant the ships were capacity-capped and passengers had to be tested before boarding,

11:10.440 --> 11:14.520
were subject to temperature checks, were required to wear a mask in communal areas, and could

11:14.520 --> 11:17.360
only go ashore on managed excursions.

11:17.360 --> 11:21.060
With these and other rules, cruise companies thought they might have cracked the code of

11:21.060 --> 11:27.640
sailing safely and profitably during a pandemic, but then reality hit.

11:27.640 --> 11:32.380
On the MS Roald Amundsen, an expedition cruise ship that typically carries 500 or so passengers

11:32.380 --> 11:38.260
through the Arctic or Antarctic, 62 people tested positive for COVID after a trip around

11:38.260 --> 11:43.100
Svalbard, putting stress on the contact tracing system of northern Norway.

11:43.100 --> 11:47.820
Elsewhere in Norway, the Seadream 1 had to cancel a cruise after a positive COVID test,

11:47.820 --> 11:53.160
and then a few months later, the very same ship left Barbados on the very first cruise

11:53.160 --> 11:57.700
in the Caribbean since the start of the pandemic, which soon had to be cancelled due to nine

11:57.700 --> 12:00.660
passengers and crew testing positive.

12:00.660 --> 12:05.300
On the other side of the continent, UnCruise Adventures left Juneau in early August on

12:05.300 --> 12:09.980
the very first cruise with passengers from an American port since March, 2020, until

12:09.980 --> 12:14.280
a passenger's test came back positive, forcing them to return to port, put all passengers

12:14.280 --> 12:18.340
under quarantine, and cancel the rest of the season.

12:18.340 --> 12:22.220
This is the reality of cruising during a pandemic.

12:22.220 --> 12:26.460
As long as passengers are originating from a place with rampant community spread, no

12:26.460 --> 12:31.140
matter how many precautions are taken, it doesn't work from a public health perspective,

12:31.140 --> 12:35.900
it doesn't work from a business perspective, it just simply doesn't work.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.980
Therefore, for the most part, even in the cases where governments weren't stopping

12:39.980 --> 12:43.180
them, cruise lines stopped trying.

12:43.180 --> 12:50.140
Nowadays, however, in spring 2021, tens of millions of COVID vaccines are entering people's

12:50.140 --> 12:55.440
arms every day around the world, and a solution has arisen.

12:55.440 --> 12:59.560
Instead of trying to prevent COVID from spreading on their ships, the cruise lines are simply

12:59.560 --> 13:04.060
going to prevent people who could have COVID from getting on their ships.

13:04.060 --> 13:08.640
Many of the major players, including Royal Caribbean, are requiring all adult passengers

13:08.640 --> 13:11.280
to be fully vaccinated before boarding.

13:11.280 --> 13:16.760
Even though no vaccine is 100% effective, having a fully vaccinated ship means that

13:16.760 --> 13:22.240
even if someone does board with COVID, this will not set off a chain reaction of community

13:22.240 --> 13:25.240
spread throughout the entire vessel.

13:25.240 --> 13:29.200
Given these new policies, cruise lines are reworking their schedules to center their

13:29.200 --> 13:33.280
business on the places where vaccines are rolling out the fastest.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.640
For example, with less than two months notice, Royal Caribbean announced that it would be

13:37.640 --> 13:41.940
sailing from Israel, home of the world's fastest vaccination campaign, for the first

13:41.940 --> 13:46.820
time ever with one of the largest cruise ships in the world—the Odyssey of the Seas.

13:46.820 --> 13:51.320
In addition, while the summer cruise season is traditionally centered on the Mediterranean,

13:51.320 --> 13:56.480
in 2021, many of the first cruises to restart will be based out of the Caribbean, in close

13:56.480 --> 14:02.200
proximity to the US, which has also had one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns.

14:02.200 --> 14:06.840
Cruise lines have, for the most part, succeeded with their grand challenge.

14:06.840 --> 14:14.360
At the end of 2020, Royal Caribbean, for example, still had $3.6 billion in the bank, as runway,

14:14.360 --> 14:19.100
and had pushed their burn rate down to $270 million a month.

14:19.100 --> 14:24.660
That means they can survive without revenue until at least February 9th, 2022.

14:24.660 --> 14:30.380
Norwegian Cruise Line, meanwhile, had enough to make it until April 25th, 2022, while Carnival

14:30.380 --> 14:34.060
had enough to last till June 9th, 2022.

14:34.060 --> 14:36.880
The cruise lines will be fine.

14:36.880 --> 14:40.140
But there is another side to the equation.

14:40.140 --> 14:46.060
While cruise lines are typically massive global enterprises, they rely on the places they

14:46.060 --> 14:47.060
visit.

14:47.060 --> 14:51.380
They rely on all the small businesses that operate tours and excursions for passengers

14:51.380 --> 14:57.860
at each port of call—specifically, they rely on places like Ketchikan, Alaska.

14:57.860 --> 15:02.380
Last summer, under strict COVID protocols, I traveled there with a film crew to document

15:02.380 --> 15:08.060
a summer like no other—a summer where the 1.2 million annual cruise tourists that keep

15:08.060 --> 15:13.300
the economy of this small town of 8,000 alive just didn't show up.

15:13.300 --> 15:18.180
Two summers ago, Ketchikan was one of the most sought-after cruise destinations in the

15:18.180 --> 15:22.920
world—they would quite literally run out of space on the docks.

15:22.920 --> 15:28.420
Last summer, they were experiencing the most acute form of economic ruin.

15:28.420 --> 15:33.500
The documentary I made, profiling this, is out now, exclusively on Nebula.

15:33.500 --> 15:38.380
It's the first on-location project we've released in almost a year, and I think you'll

15:38.380 --> 15:40.740
find it quite interesting.

15:40.740 --> 15:46.340
Of course, as any long-time Wendover viewer knows, the best and cheapest way to get access

15:46.340 --> 15:52.580
to Nebula is with the CuriosityStream-Nebula bundle deal—available on sale for $15 a

15:52.580 --> 15:56.860
year right now at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

15:56.860 --> 16:02.680
This gets you access to both Nebula and CuriosityStream, where you can watch thousands of great non-fiction

16:02.680 --> 16:08.060
shows and documentaries like China's Last Little Train, which profiles the last working

16:08.060 --> 16:13.580
narrow-gauge steam railway in China, connecting an area without cars, buses, or even roads

16:13.580 --> 16:15.220
to the outside world.

16:15.220 --> 16:20.020
Of course, these subscriptions are what goes to fund the great Nebula originals that many

16:20.020 --> 16:25.220
of you have come to enjoy, and they help independent creators like us stay independent.

16:25.220 --> 16:30.740
So, get a year's worth of education and entertainment, with access to both CuriosityStream

16:30.740 --> 16:36.020

16:36.020 --> 16:39.740
the current sale, at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
