3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,000
Africa is often viewed quite poorly on the world stage.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,960
The continent holds plenty of violent, corrupt, and unstable nations in the majority of the

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,300
world's least developed countries, but Africa is big.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,200
There are 54 countries there and not all fall into the generalizations of the continent

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,360
as a whole—perhaps most notably, Rwanda.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,240
One of the easiest ways to compare countries is through their indicators and Rwanda's

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,600
are impressive.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,860
For every 100,000 residents, Rwanda has, on average, only 2.5 murders per year.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:41,480
As a point of comparison, that's lower than India's 3.2 or the United States' 5.4.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,360
It's even more impressive when looking at the kind of neighborhood Rwanda is in.

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,800
Uganda has 11.5, Tanzania has 7, Burundi has 6, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo

14
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
has 13.6 murders per 100,000.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,720
In addition, Rwanda is ranked as the 48th least corrupt country in the world.

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,240
That's not perfect, but on the continent, only Botswana, a far richer country, ranks

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
higher.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,920
The country also has a 67-year life expectancy, tied for 4th best in Africa and only slightly

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,640
below the world average.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,640
That 67-year number is believable but what's truly unbelievable is that 25 years ago, the

21
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,360
average Rwandan had a life expectancy of 28 years.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,540
25 years ago, Rwanda was in the midst of one of the most horrific genocides in history.

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,780
In only 100 days, 800,000 Rwandans were murdered in the midst of this ethnic conflict.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,140
The group primarily targeted, the Tutsi, saw the loss of about 75% of its population.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,000
With time, though, the country emerged from the other end, peace prevailed, and its indicators

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,740
began their steady climb upwards to where they are today.

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,020
It is now the 15th fastest growing economy in the world as its government has set out

28
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,680
a clearly defined mission—they want to become the Singapore of Africa.

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,560
To understand what this means, though, you have to understand what Singapore is.

30
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,000
It's easy to forget that East Asia was not the highly developed, economically powerful

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,560
place it is today 100 years ago.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,200
Many refer to the 1800s as Britain's century, the 1900s as America's century, and the

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,040
2000s as Asia's century.

34
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,560
It's thought that we are currently in the century where Asia will prevail and one of

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,800
the countries driving that is Singapore.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
Singapore sits at the top of all the indicators—not just for Asia, but the world.

37
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,680
It's the 8th safest, 3rd richest, 3rd least corrupt, 3rd longest living country in the

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
world.

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,600
60 years ago, in the 1960s, Singapore's economy had a size of about $700 million.

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,960
Today, that number is $320 billion.

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,240
In the last ten years alone, its GDP has doubled.

42
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,600
It went from a definitively third-world country to a definitively first-world country in less

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,800
than a lifetime.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,880
The country is intensely focused on being the business hub for Asia.

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,200
Of the world's 20 largest companies, 15 have operations in Singapore.

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,680
It's tough to look at the results of Singapore's economic development without being impressed.

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,980
They have done the nearly impossible.

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,680
Some of the ways Singapore has achieved this growth, though, has met some criticism.

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,800
The way Singapore is run politically has been described as paternalistic—it's not quite

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,200
authoritarian, but some freedoms are lacking.

51
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,900
One of the few indicators that Singapore does not rank at the top of is the Democracy Index.

52
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,900
It scores a 6.4 out of 10 which ranks it at 66th in the world and categorizes it as

53
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,540
a flawed democracy.

54
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,300
The elements of this paternalism range from small things like the country's ban on chewing

55
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,340
gum for cleanliness purposes to big things like the limitations on freedom of speech,

56
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,820
assembly, and the press.

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,780
To this, proponents would say, look at the results.

58
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,420
The country has succeeded economically based off the trade that seemingly more and more

59
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,980
countries are embracing—liberty for prosperity.

60
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,460
Rwanda has been paying attention.

61
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,340
Paul Kagame, its president, declared that mission to turn the country into the Singapore

62
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,820
of Africa and in many ways, it's already well on its way.

63
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,580
Arguing that Rwanda is authoritarian is easy.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,020
On the same democracy indicator where Singapore is categorized as a flawed democracy, Rwanda

65
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,300
earns a score of 3.4 out of 10 and the categorization of authoritarian.

66
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:06,100
Paul Kagame was first elected in 2003, then again in 2010, and again in 2017 with 98.8%

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
of the vote.

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,460
The US Department of State, though, described that third election as having some, quote,

69
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,460
irregularities.

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,020
That also came after a constitutional amendment lifting term limits to let Kagame take power

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,020
again.

72
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,240
He is clearly well-liked and impressive.

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,700
He began his career in the military, played a part in toppling the oppressive governments

74
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,020
of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC, and has been described as, quote, perhaps the most successful

75
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,020
general alive.

76
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,800
He is by all accounts a military genius and since his fighting days he has risen Rwanda

77
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,040
from chaos into peace and prosperity but as a political leader, he himself is still

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,500
oppressive.

79
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Just like Singapore, there are severe limitations on the freedom of speech, assembly, and the

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
press.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,520
There are even accusations of Kagame supporting or arranging the assassination of his political

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,520
opponents.

83
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,080
Looking at the ends, though, there are clearly more parallels with Singapore.

84
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,400
Singapore's success as a business hub can be attributed to three factors—geographic

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,800
centrality, political stability, and ease of doing business.

86
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,120
As part of Kagame's mission, Rwanda is working to improve these same three factors.

87
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,000
For the first factor, Singapore sits as a central point in the world.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,320
Within an eight hour flight one can get to the major business hubs of the Middle East

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,720
and the UAE and Qatar, all of India, all of East Asia's major business hubs, and all

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,000
of Australia.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,280
Meanwhile, Rwanda sits only 600 miles or 950 kilometers from the geographic center of Africa.

92
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,040
It is about as central as you can get on the enormous continent.

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,200
For both countries, though, geographic centrality means nothing unless you can actually get

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
to them.

95
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,860
One of Singapore's largest companies is Singapore Airlines—often considered one

96
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,960
of the best, if not the best, airline in the world.

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,320
Thanks to this airline, one can get from Singapore to five different continents in a matter of

98
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
hours.

99
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,660
It's easy to underestimate the importance of having a globally competitive airline to

100
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,680
establish a city as a business hub.

101
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,400
It's safe to say that other business hubs, such as Dubai and Doha, would not be as influential

102
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,880
as they are today without their airlines.

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,060
Rwanda has clearly noticed this.

104
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,160
Their national airline, Rwandair, which is government owned, has grown from a tiny operation

105
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,600
with a few regional jets to a significant intercontinental airline operating brand new

106
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
planes.

107
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,540
They now fly all around Africa, to Dubai, Brussels, and London, and have even announced

108
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,880
plans to start one stop service to both Guangzhou, China, and New York.

109
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,680
While the airline is not yet nearly at the level of some larger players on the continent

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,360
like Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, it's serving its job effectively

111
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,640
of connecting Rwanda to the world.

112
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,420
The second factor to Singapore's economic success is political stability.

113
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,840
The World Bank rates countries in terms of political stability and absence of violence

114
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,280
and terrorism and for this, Singapore, unsurprisingly, comes up in the 99th percentile—better than

115
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,340
almost any country in the world.

116
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,420
This is a big reason why a CEO might choose to set up their Asian hub in Singapore over

117
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,640
Hong Kong, for example, which only scores in the 75th percentile for political stability

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,560
and is trending downwards.

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,700
They want to operate in a place that they know won't change quickly on a political

120
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,240
level since there are inherent costs involved with a changing external environment.

121
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,700
Rwanda sits at the 48th percentile for this political stability indicator well in the

122
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,020
middle of the pack.

123
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,540
This isn't phenomenal, but compared to the sub-Saharan average of 31, it's doing alright.

124
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,060
It's a contentious issue whether elements of authoritarianism promote or impede political

125
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,060
stability.

126
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,020
In Rwanda's case, with so few years under the current form of government, it's tough

127
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,200
to know if the country really is stable or not.

128
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,320
Rwanda is now, by many accounts, a police state.

129
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,900
There are random checkpoints all around the country and strict security at most buildings

130
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,720
in Kigali, the capital.

131
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,840
Kigali is now one of the cleanest cities in Africa, let alone the world, partially due

132
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,280
to a ban on single-use plastics and plastic bags but also because all able-bodied members

133
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,520
of the population are required to participate in a community cleaning day on the last Saturday

134
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
of each month.

135
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,080
According to one report, there's even widespread unlawful detention of what are described as

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,120
undesirables on the streets.

137
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
The test of whether this country is truly stable or rather in a state of temporary fear-based

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,440
obedience might not have yet come.

139
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,920
Rwanda has not experienced a transition of power since 2000 and nobody really knows whether

140
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,360
the country can continue on the right path after Kagame leaves.

141
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,160
He himself even said that if he had not groomed a successor by 2017, quote, it means that

142
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,200
I have not created capacity for a post-Me Rwanda.

143
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,360
I see this as a personal failure.

144
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,600
It's now well past 2017 and Kagame is still in power with no signs of leaving.

145
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,560
Regardless of the reasons, though, for Rwanda's current political stability, it's sure that

146
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,640
businesses like it.

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,000
It's one of the top factors to look at when deciding which countries to operate in.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,520
The third factor that led to Singapore's business success, ease of doing business,

149
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,560
is perhaps the most important one and it's also the one at which Rwanda most excels.

150
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,040
This is a broad factor, but it's one that the World Bank tracks with a well-known indicator,

151
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,020
the ease of doing business index.

152
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,900
This looks at ten factors—ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits,

153
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,540
getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors,

154
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,740
paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency.

155
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,940
Singapore ranks at number two in the world behind New Zealand and is followed up by Denmark,

156
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,500
Hong Kong, and South Korea.

157
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,660
Rwanda, meanwhile, scores as the 29th.

158
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,580
This is an impressive score by itself but it is incredibly impressive when considering

159
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,740
how the rest of the continent ranks up.

160
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,160
Rwanda is by far the highest ranked among mainland African nations.

161
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,560
The nearest trailing African nation is Morocco at number 60 and plenty of highly developed

162
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,920
countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan rank lower than Rwanda.

163
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,020
To achieve this, Rwanda has made plenty of economic and legislative reforms to foster

164
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,460
the business-friendly environment.

165
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,500
They've also been focusing on building both soft and hard infrastructure.

166
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:42,140
The government, in collaboration with private investors, built an enormous $300 million

167
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,900
convention center along with a five-star Radisson Blu hotel to attract the convention

168
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,380
market in addition to less flashy infrastructure projects building roads and airports.

169
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,700
Overall, Rwanda is on the hunt for international investment in the country and so far, that's

170
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,700
paid off.

171
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,980
In 2005, $10.5 million were invested from abroad in Rwanda.

172
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,740
In 2017, that number was $293 million.

173
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,260
Clearly a lot is working in Rwanda.

174
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,360
It's safe, clean, and growing economically.

175
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,840
What more could a country want?

176
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,080
Well, there are serious questions from abroad on whether Rwanda's growth is ethical, replicatable,

177
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,020
sustainable, and even real.

178
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:25,240
The way Rwanda has achieved its current stability and growth has some external observers condemning

179
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
it.

180
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,040
Appearances of Rwanda can also be deceiving.

181
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,040
It is still one of the poorest countries in the world with the average resident earning

182
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,880
only $750 a year.

183
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,000
Some question whether the country should be spending so much on its airline, its infrastructure,

184
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,560
and its capital when so many in the country are so poor.

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,880
Some question whether the country is growing for its middle and upper class while leaving

186
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,480
its rural poor behind.

187
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,400
It's no surprise, though, that many of the country's neighbors, curbed by violence

188
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,680
and poverty, have pondered whether they should be replicating the ways of Kagame.

189
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,540
External observers have given mixed answers to that question.

190
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,440
Some believe that the current authoritarian policies will let dissent bottle up and eventually

191
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
explode.

192
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,160
They worry that the country will erupt into violence again.

193
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,800
Some say that the current regime is solely focused on making things seem like they're

194
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,260
improving through climbing up in the indicators without making real, rational change.

195
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,640
There are even some accusations that Rwandan GDP growth figures might be inflated or otherwise

196
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
manipulated.

197
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,500
It's sure that Rwanda has been growing enormously, but is it really this much?

198
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,800
There is no one recipe for economic growth.

199
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,420
The fact that the United States became the superpower of the 20th century and China is

200
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,560
becoming the superpower of the 21st century proves that more than anything.

201
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,640
Economic states grow and autocratic states grow.

202
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,520
They might grow in different ways, but there are success stories on both ends of the spectrum.

203
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,220
What external observers have so much trouble answering is the means to the end question.

204
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,080
Should Rwanda's growth be lauded given how it has achieved?

205
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Can you tolerate some bad in exchange for much good?

206
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,880
In the end, Rwanda is the country of Rwandans and they are the only ones that matter with

207
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
these questions.

208
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,740
If Rwanda is truly working for all Rwandans, then Rwanda is working.

209
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,340
There are a lot of ifs, but if Rwandan growth is sustainable, and if Rwandan politics are

210
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,900
stable, and if Rwanda's investments pay off, and if businesses pay attention to Rwanda,

211
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,780
there's a very good chance that the country is well on its way to becoming the Singapore

212
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,920
of Africa.

213
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,460
