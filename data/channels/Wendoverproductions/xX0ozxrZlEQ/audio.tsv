8920	12000	Africa is often viewed quite poorly on the world stage.
12000	15960	The continent holds plenty of violent, corrupt, and unstable nations in the majority of the
15960	19300	world's least developed countries, but Africa is big.
19300	23200	There are 54 countries there and not all fall into the generalizations of the continent
23200	26360	as a whole—perhaps most notably, Rwanda.
26360	30240	One of the easiest ways to compare countries is through their indicators and Rwanda's
30240	31600	are impressive.
31600	36860	For every 100,000 residents, Rwanda has, on average, only 2.5 murders per year.
36860	41480	As a point of comparison, that's lower than India's 3.2 or the United States' 5.4.
41480	45360	It's even more impressive when looking at the kind of neighborhood Rwanda is in.
45360	50800	Uganda has 11.5, Tanzania has 7, Burundi has 6, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
50800	53920	has 13.6 murders per 100,000.
53920	57720	In addition, Rwanda is ranked as the 48th least corrupt country in the world.
57720	62240	That's not perfect, but on the continent, only Botswana, a far richer country, ranks
62240	63240	higher.
63240	67920	The country also has a 67-year life expectancy, tied for 4th best in Africa and only slightly
67920	69640	below the world average.
69640	74640	That 67-year number is believable but what's truly unbelievable is that 25 years ago, the
74640	78360	average Rwandan had a life expectancy of 28 years.
78360	83540	25 years ago, Rwanda was in the midst of one of the most horrific genocides in history.
83540	88780	In only 100 days, 800,000 Rwandans were murdered in the midst of this ethnic conflict.
88780	94140	The group primarily targeted, the Tutsi, saw the loss of about 75% of its population.
94140	98000	With time, though, the country emerged from the other end, peace prevailed, and its indicators
98000	100740	began their steady climb upwards to where they are today.
100740	105020	It is now the 15th fastest growing economy in the world as its government has set out
105020	109680	a clearly defined mission—they want to become the Singapore of Africa.
109680	113560	To understand what this means, though, you have to understand what Singapore is.
113560	118000	It's easy to forget that East Asia was not the highly developed, economically powerful
118000	120560	place it is today 100 years ago.
120560	125200	Many refer to the 1800s as Britain's century, the 1900s as America's century, and the
125200	127040	2000s as Asia's century.
127040	130560	It's thought that we are currently in the century where Asia will prevail and one of
130560	132800	the countries driving that is Singapore.
132800	137040	Singapore sits at the top of all the indicators—not just for Asia, but the world.
137280	141680	It's the 8th safest, 3rd richest, 3rd least corrupt, 3rd longest living country in the
141680	142680	world.
142680	147600	60 years ago, in the 1960s, Singapore's economy had a size of about $700 million.
147600	151960	Today, that number is $320 billion.
151960	155240	In the last ten years alone, its GDP has doubled.
155240	159600	It went from a definitively third-world country to a definitively first-world country in less
159600	160800	than a lifetime.
160800	164880	The country is intensely focused on being the business hub for Asia.
164880	169200	Of the world's 20 largest companies, 15 have operations in Singapore.
169200	173680	It's tough to look at the results of Singapore's economic development without being impressed.
173680	175980	They have done the nearly impossible.
175980	179680	Some of the ways Singapore has achieved this growth, though, has met some criticism.
179680	183800	The way Singapore is run politically has been described as paternalistic—it's not quite
183800	187200	authoritarian, but some freedoms are lacking.
187200	191900	One of the few indicators that Singapore does not rank at the top of is the Democracy Index.
191900	196900	It scores a 6.4 out of 10 which ranks it at 66th in the world and categorizes it as
196900	198540	a flawed democracy.
198540	202300	The elements of this paternalism range from small things like the country's ban on chewing
202300	206340	gum for cleanliness purposes to big things like the limitations on freedom of speech,
206340	207820	assembly, and the press.
207820	210780	To this, proponents would say, look at the results.
210780	214420	The country has succeeded economically based off the trade that seemingly more and more
214420	217980	countries are embracing—liberty for prosperity.
217980	219460	Rwanda has been paying attention.
219820	224340	Paul Kagame, its president, declared that mission to turn the country into the Singapore
224340	227820	of Africa and in many ways, it's already well on its way.
227820	230580	Arguing that Rwanda is authoritarian is easy.
230580	235020	On the same democracy indicator where Singapore is categorized as a flawed democracy, Rwanda
235020	239300	earns a score of 3.4 out of 10 and the categorization of authoritarian.
239300	246100	Paul Kagame was first elected in 2003, then again in 2010, and again in 2017 with 98.8%
246100	247100	of the vote.
247100	251460	The US Department of State, though, described that third election as having some, quote,
251460	252460	irregularities.
252460	257020	That also came after a constitutional amendment lifting term limits to let Kagame take power
257020	258020	again.
258020	260240	He is clearly well-liked and impressive.
260240	263700	He began his career in the military, played a part in toppling the oppressive governments
263700	269020	of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC, and has been described as, quote, perhaps the most successful
269020	270020	general alive.
270020	274800	He is by all accounts a military genius and since his fighting days he has risen Rwanda
274800	280040	from chaos into peace and prosperity but as a political leader, he himself is still
280040	281500	oppressive.
281500	286000	Just like Singapore, there are severe limitations on the freedom of speech, assembly, and the
286000	287000	press.
287000	291520	There are even accusations of Kagame supporting or arranging the assassination of his political
291520	292520	opponents.
292520	296080	Looking at the ends, though, there are clearly more parallels with Singapore.
296080	300400	Singapore's success as a business hub can be attributed to three factors—geographic
300400	303800	centrality, political stability, and ease of doing business.
303800	308120	As part of Kagame's mission, Rwanda is working to improve these same three factors.
308120	312000	For the first factor, Singapore sits as a central point in the world.
312000	315320	Within an eight hour flight one can get to the major business hubs of the Middle East
315320	319720	and the UAE and Qatar, all of India, all of East Asia's major business hubs, and all
319720	321000	of Australia.
321000	326280	Meanwhile, Rwanda sits only 600 miles or 950 kilometers from the geographic center of Africa.
326280	330040	It is about as central as you can get on the enormous continent.
330040	334200	For both countries, though, geographic centrality means nothing unless you can actually get
334200	335200	to them.
335200	338860	One of Singapore's largest companies is Singapore Airlines—often considered one
338860	341960	of the best, if not the best, airline in the world.
341960	346320	Thanks to this airline, one can get from Singapore to five different continents in a matter of
346320	347320	hours.
347320	350660	It's easy to underestimate the importance of having a globally competitive airline to
350660	352680	establish a city as a business hub.
352680	357400	It's safe to say that other business hubs, such as Dubai and Doha, would not be as influential
357400	359880	as they are today without their airlines.
359880	362060	Rwanda has clearly noticed this.
362060	366160	Their national airline, Rwandair, which is government owned, has grown from a tiny operation
366160	370600	with a few regional jets to a significant intercontinental airline operating brand new
370600	371600	planes.
371600	375540	They now fly all around Africa, to Dubai, Brussels, and London, and have even announced
375540	378880	plans to start one stop service to both Guangzhou, China, and New York.
378880	382680	While the airline is not yet nearly at the level of some larger players on the continent
382680	386360	like Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, it's serving its job effectively
386360	388640	of connecting Rwanda to the world.
388640	392420	The second factor to Singapore's economic success is political stability.
392420	395840	The World Bank rates countries in terms of political stability and absence of violence
395840	401280	and terrorism and for this, Singapore, unsurprisingly, comes up in the 99th percentile—better than
401280	403340	almost any country in the world.
403340	407420	This is a big reason why a CEO might choose to set up their Asian hub in Singapore over
407420	411640	Hong Kong, for example, which only scores in the 75th percentile for political stability
411640	413560	and is trending downwards.
413560	416700	They want to operate in a place that they know won't change quickly on a political
416700	421240	level since there are inherent costs involved with a changing external environment.
421240	425700	Rwanda sits at the 48th percentile for this political stability indicator well in the
425700	427020	middle of the pack.
427020	431540	This isn't phenomenal, but compared to the sub-Saharan average of 31, it's doing alright.
431540	436060	It's a contentious issue whether elements of authoritarianism promote or impede political
436060	437060	stability.
437060	441020	In Rwanda's case, with so few years under the current form of government, it's tough
441020	444200	to know if the country really is stable or not.
444200	447320	Rwanda is now, by many accounts, a police state.
447320	450900	There are random checkpoints all around the country and strict security at most buildings
450900	452720	in Kigali, the capital.
452720	456840	Kigali is now one of the cleanest cities in Africa, let alone the world, partially due
456840	461280	to a ban on single-use plastics and plastic bags but also because all able-bodied members
461280	465520	of the population are required to participate in a community cleaning day on the last Saturday
465520	466960	of each month.
466960	471080	According to one report, there's even widespread unlawful detention of what are described as
471080	473120	undesirables on the streets.
473120	477680	The test of whether this country is truly stable or rather in a state of temporary fear-based
477680	480440	obedience might not have yet come.
480440	484920	Rwanda has not experienced a transition of power since 2000 and nobody really knows whether
484920	488360	the country can continue on the right path after Kagame leaves.
488360	493160	He himself even said that if he had not groomed a successor by 2017, quote, it means that
493160	496200	I have not created capacity for a post-Me Rwanda.
496200	498360	I see this as a personal failure.
498360	503600	It's now well past 2017 and Kagame is still in power with no signs of leaving.
503600	507560	Regardless of the reasons, though, for Rwanda's current political stability, it's sure that
507560	508640	businesses like it.
508640	513000	It's one of the top factors to look at when deciding which countries to operate in.
513000	516520	The third factor that led to Singapore's business success, ease of doing business,
516520	521560	is perhaps the most important one and it's also the one at which Rwanda most excels.
521560	526040	This is a broad factor, but it's one that the World Bank tracks with a well-known indicator,
526040	528020	the ease of doing business index.
528020	531900	This looks at ten factors—ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits,
531900	535540	getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors,
535540	539740	paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency.
539740	543940	Singapore ranks at number two in the world behind New Zealand and is followed up by Denmark,
543940	545500	Hong Kong, and South Korea.
545500	548660	Rwanda, meanwhile, scores as the 29th.
548660	552580	This is an impressive score by itself but it is incredibly impressive when considering
552580	554740	how the rest of the continent ranks up.
554780	559160	Rwanda is by far the highest ranked among mainland African nations.
559160	563560	The nearest trailing African nation is Morocco at number 60 and plenty of highly developed
563560	567920	countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan rank lower than Rwanda.
567920	572020	To achieve this, Rwanda has made plenty of economic and legislative reforms to foster
572020	573460	the business-friendly environment.
573460	577500	They've also been focusing on building both soft and hard infrastructure.
577500	582140	The government, in collaboration with private investors, built an enormous $300 million
582140	585900	convention center along with a five-star Radisson Blu hotel to attract the convention
585900	590380	market in addition to less flashy infrastructure projects building roads and airports.
590380	595700	Overall, Rwanda is on the hunt for international investment in the country and so far, that's
595700	596700	paid off.
596700	600980	In 2005, $10.5 million were invested from abroad in Rwanda.
600980	605740	In 2017, that number was $293 million.
605740	608260	Clearly a lot is working in Rwanda.
608260	611360	It's safe, clean, and growing economically.
611360	612840	What more could a country want?
612840	618080	Well, there are serious questions from abroad on whether Rwanda's growth is ethical, replicatable,
618080	620020	sustainable, and even real.
620020	625240	The way Rwanda has achieved its current stability and growth has some external observers condemning
625240	626240	it.
626240	628040	Appearances of Rwanda can also be deceiving.
628040	632040	It is still one of the poorest countries in the world with the average resident earning
632040	634880	only $750 a year.
634880	639000	Some question whether the country should be spending so much on its airline, its infrastructure,
639000	642560	and its capital when so many in the country are so poor.
642560	645880	Some question whether the country is growing for its middle and upper class while leaving
645880	647480	its rural poor behind.
647480	651400	It's no surprise, though, that many of the country's neighbors, curbed by violence
651400	655680	and poverty, have pondered whether they should be replicating the ways of Kagame.
655680	658540	External observers have given mixed answers to that question.
658540	662440	Some believe that the current authoritarian policies will let dissent bottle up and eventually
662440	663440	explode.
663440	666160	They worry that the country will erupt into violence again.
666160	669800	Some say that the current regime is solely focused on making things seem like they're
669800	674260	improving through climbing up in the indicators without making real, rational change.
674260	678640	There are even some accusations that Rwandan GDP growth figures might be inflated or otherwise
678640	679640	manipulated.
679640	684500	It's sure that Rwanda has been growing enormously, but is it really this much?
684500	687800	There is no one recipe for economic growth.
687800	691420	The fact that the United States became the superpower of the 20th century and China is
691420	695560	becoming the superpower of the 21st century proves that more than anything.
695560	697640	Economic states grow and autocratic states grow.
697640	702520	They might grow in different ways, but there are success stories on both ends of the spectrum.
702520	707220	What external observers have so much trouble answering is the means to the end question.
707220	710080	Should Rwanda's growth be lauded given how it has achieved?
710080	713400	Can you tolerate some bad in exchange for much good?
713400	717880	In the end, Rwanda is the country of Rwandans and they are the only ones that matter with
717880	718880	these questions.
718880	723740	If Rwanda is truly working for all Rwandans, then Rwanda is working.
723740	728340	There are a lot of ifs, but if Rwandan growth is sustainable, and if Rwandan politics are
728340	732900	stable, and if Rwanda's investments pay off, and if businesses pay attention to Rwanda,
732900	737780	there's a very good chance that the country is well on its way to becoming the Singapore
737780	739920	of Africa.
739920	743460	If you're interested in learning more about Singapore, there's a fascinating documentary
743460	747860	on CuriosityStream about how the country is dealing with the problem of having a huge,
