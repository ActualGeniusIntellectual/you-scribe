00:08.920 --> 00:12.000
Africa is often viewed quite poorly on the world stage.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.960
The continent holds plenty of violent, corrupt, and unstable nations in the majority of the

00:15.960 --> 00:19.300
world's least developed countries, but Africa is big.

00:19.300 --> 00:23.200
There are 54 countries there and not all fall into the generalizations of the continent

00:23.200 --> 00:26.360
as a whole—perhaps most notably, Rwanda.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.240
One of the easiest ways to compare countries is through their indicators and Rwanda's

00:30.240 --> 00:31.600
are impressive.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.860
For every 100,000 residents, Rwanda has, on average, only 2.5 murders per year.

00:36.860 --> 00:41.480
As a point of comparison, that's lower than India's 3.2 or the United States' 5.4.

00:41.480 --> 00:45.360
It's even more impressive when looking at the kind of neighborhood Rwanda is in.

00:45.360 --> 00:50.800
Uganda has 11.5, Tanzania has 7, Burundi has 6, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo

00:50.800 --> 00:53.920
has 13.6 murders per 100,000.

00:53.920 --> 00:57.720
In addition, Rwanda is ranked as the 48th least corrupt country in the world.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.240
That's not perfect, but on the continent, only Botswana, a far richer country, ranks

01:02.240 --> 01:03.240
higher.

01:03.240 --> 01:07.920
The country also has a 67-year life expectancy, tied for 4th best in Africa and only slightly

01:07.920 --> 01:09.640
below the world average.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.640
That 67-year number is believable but what's truly unbelievable is that 25 years ago, the

01:14.640 --> 01:18.360
average Rwandan had a life expectancy of 28 years.

01:18.360 --> 01:23.540
25 years ago, Rwanda was in the midst of one of the most horrific genocides in history.

01:23.540 --> 01:28.780
In only 100 days, 800,000 Rwandans were murdered in the midst of this ethnic conflict.

01:28.780 --> 01:34.140
The group primarily targeted, the Tutsi, saw the loss of about 75% of its population.

01:34.140 --> 01:38.000
With time, though, the country emerged from the other end, peace prevailed, and its indicators

01:38.000 --> 01:40.740
began their steady climb upwards to where they are today.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.020
It is now the 15th fastest growing economy in the world as its government has set out

01:45.020 --> 01:49.680
a clearly defined mission—they want to become the Singapore of Africa.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.560
To understand what this means, though, you have to understand what Singapore is.

01:53.560 --> 01:58.000
It's easy to forget that East Asia was not the highly developed, economically powerful

01:58.000 --> 02:00.560
place it is today 100 years ago.

02:00.560 --> 02:05.200
Many refer to the 1800s as Britain's century, the 1900s as America's century, and the

02:05.200 --> 02:07.040
2000s as Asia's century.

02:07.040 --> 02:10.560
It's thought that we are currently in the century where Asia will prevail and one of

02:10.560 --> 02:12.800
the countries driving that is Singapore.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.040
Singapore sits at the top of all the indicators—not just for Asia, but the world.

02:17.280 --> 02:21.680
It's the 8th safest, 3rd richest, 3rd least corrupt, 3rd longest living country in the

02:21.680 --> 02:22.680
world.

02:22.680 --> 02:27.600
60 years ago, in the 1960s, Singapore's economy had a size of about $700 million.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.960
Today, that number is $320 billion.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.240
In the last ten years alone, its GDP has doubled.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.600
It went from a definitively third-world country to a definitively first-world country in less

02:39.600 --> 02:40.800
than a lifetime.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.880
The country is intensely focused on being the business hub for Asia.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.200
Of the world's 20 largest companies, 15 have operations in Singapore.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.680
It's tough to look at the results of Singapore's economic development without being impressed.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.980
They have done the nearly impossible.

02:55.980 --> 02:59.680
Some of the ways Singapore has achieved this growth, though, has met some criticism.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.800
The way Singapore is run politically has been described as paternalistic—it's not quite

03:03.800 --> 03:07.200
authoritarian, but some freedoms are lacking.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.900
One of the few indicators that Singapore does not rank at the top of is the Democracy Index.

03:11.900 --> 03:16.900
It scores a 6.4 out of 10 which ranks it at 66th in the world and categorizes it as

03:16.900 --> 03:18.540
a flawed democracy.

03:18.540 --> 03:22.300
The elements of this paternalism range from small things like the country's ban on chewing

03:22.300 --> 03:26.340
gum for cleanliness purposes to big things like the limitations on freedom of speech,

03:26.340 --> 03:27.820
assembly, and the press.

03:27.820 --> 03:30.780
To this, proponents would say, look at the results.

03:30.780 --> 03:34.420
The country has succeeded economically based off the trade that seemingly more and more

03:34.420 --> 03:37.980
countries are embracing—liberty for prosperity.

03:37.980 --> 03:39.460
Rwanda has been paying attention.

03:39.820 --> 03:44.340
Paul Kagame, its president, declared that mission to turn the country into the Singapore

03:44.340 --> 03:47.820
of Africa and in many ways, it's already well on its way.

03:47.820 --> 03:50.580
Arguing that Rwanda is authoritarian is easy.

03:50.580 --> 03:55.020
On the same democracy indicator where Singapore is categorized as a flawed democracy, Rwanda

03:55.020 --> 03:59.300
earns a score of 3.4 out of 10 and the categorization of authoritarian.

03:59.300 --> 04:06.100
Paul Kagame was first elected in 2003, then again in 2010, and again in 2017 with 98.8%

04:06.100 --> 04:07.100
of the vote.

04:07.100 --> 04:11.460
The US Department of State, though, described that third election as having some, quote,

04:11.460 --> 04:12.460
irregularities.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.020
That also came after a constitutional amendment lifting term limits to let Kagame take power

04:17.020 --> 04:18.020
again.

04:18.020 --> 04:20.240
He is clearly well-liked and impressive.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.700
He began his career in the military, played a part in toppling the oppressive governments

04:23.700 --> 04:29.020
of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC, and has been described as, quote, perhaps the most successful

04:29.020 --> 04:30.020
general alive.

04:30.020 --> 04:34.800
He is by all accounts a military genius and since his fighting days he has risen Rwanda

04:34.800 --> 04:40.040
from chaos into peace and prosperity but as a political leader, he himself is still

04:40.040 --> 04:41.500
oppressive.

04:41.500 --> 04:46.000
Just like Singapore, there are severe limitations on the freedom of speech, assembly, and the

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
press.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.520
There are even accusations of Kagame supporting or arranging the assassination of his political

04:51.520 --> 04:52.520
opponents.

04:52.520 --> 04:56.080
Looking at the ends, though, there are clearly more parallels with Singapore.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.400
Singapore's success as a business hub can be attributed to three factors—geographic

05:00.400 --> 05:03.800
centrality, political stability, and ease of doing business.

05:03.800 --> 05:08.120
As part of Kagame's mission, Rwanda is working to improve these same three factors.

05:08.120 --> 05:12.000
For the first factor, Singapore sits as a central point in the world.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.320
Within an eight hour flight one can get to the major business hubs of the Middle East

05:15.320 --> 05:19.720
and the UAE and Qatar, all of India, all of East Asia's major business hubs, and all

05:19.720 --> 05:21.000
of Australia.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.280
Meanwhile, Rwanda sits only 600 miles or 950 kilometers from the geographic center of Africa.

05:26.280 --> 05:30.040
It is about as central as you can get on the enormous continent.

05:30.040 --> 05:34.200
For both countries, though, geographic centrality means nothing unless you can actually get

05:34.200 --> 05:35.200
to them.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.860
One of Singapore's largest companies is Singapore Airlines—often considered one

05:38.860 --> 05:41.960
of the best, if not the best, airline in the world.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.320
Thanks to this airline, one can get from Singapore to five different continents in a matter of

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
hours.

05:47.320 --> 05:50.660
It's easy to underestimate the importance of having a globally competitive airline to

05:50.660 --> 05:52.680
establish a city as a business hub.

05:52.680 --> 05:57.400
It's safe to say that other business hubs, such as Dubai and Doha, would not be as influential

05:57.400 --> 05:59.880
as they are today without their airlines.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.060
Rwanda has clearly noticed this.

06:02.060 --> 06:06.160
Their national airline, Rwandair, which is government owned, has grown from a tiny operation

06:06.160 --> 06:10.600
with a few regional jets to a significant intercontinental airline operating brand new

06:10.600 --> 06:11.600
planes.

06:11.600 --> 06:15.540
They now fly all around Africa, to Dubai, Brussels, and London, and have even announced

06:15.540 --> 06:18.880
plans to start one stop service to both Guangzhou, China, and New York.

06:18.880 --> 06:22.680
While the airline is not yet nearly at the level of some larger players on the continent

06:22.680 --> 06:26.360
like Ethiopian Airlines and South African Airways, it's serving its job effectively

06:26.360 --> 06:28.640
of connecting Rwanda to the world.

06:28.640 --> 06:32.420
The second factor to Singapore's economic success is political stability.

06:32.420 --> 06:35.840
The World Bank rates countries in terms of political stability and absence of violence

06:35.840 --> 06:41.280
and terrorism and for this, Singapore, unsurprisingly, comes up in the 99th percentile—better than

06:41.280 --> 06:43.340
almost any country in the world.

06:43.340 --> 06:47.420
This is a big reason why a CEO might choose to set up their Asian hub in Singapore over

06:47.420 --> 06:51.640
Hong Kong, for example, which only scores in the 75th percentile for political stability

06:51.640 --> 06:53.560
and is trending downwards.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.700
They want to operate in a place that they know won't change quickly on a political

06:56.700 --> 07:01.240
level since there are inherent costs involved with a changing external environment.

07:01.240 --> 07:05.700
Rwanda sits at the 48th percentile for this political stability indicator well in the

07:05.700 --> 07:07.020
middle of the pack.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.540
This isn't phenomenal, but compared to the sub-Saharan average of 31, it's doing alright.

07:11.540 --> 07:16.060
It's a contentious issue whether elements of authoritarianism promote or impede political

07:16.060 --> 07:17.060
stability.

07:17.060 --> 07:21.020
In Rwanda's case, with so few years under the current form of government, it's tough

07:21.020 --> 07:24.200
to know if the country really is stable or not.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.320
Rwanda is now, by many accounts, a police state.

07:27.320 --> 07:30.900
There are random checkpoints all around the country and strict security at most buildings

07:30.900 --> 07:32.720
in Kigali, the capital.

07:32.720 --> 07:36.840
Kigali is now one of the cleanest cities in Africa, let alone the world, partially due

07:36.840 --> 07:41.280
to a ban on single-use plastics and plastic bags but also because all able-bodied members

07:41.280 --> 07:45.520
of the population are required to participate in a community cleaning day on the last Saturday

07:45.520 --> 07:46.960
of each month.

07:46.960 --> 07:51.080
According to one report, there's even widespread unlawful detention of what are described as

07:51.080 --> 07:53.120
undesirables on the streets.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.680
The test of whether this country is truly stable or rather in a state of temporary fear-based

07:57.680 --> 08:00.440
obedience might not have yet come.

08:00.440 --> 08:04.920
Rwanda has not experienced a transition of power since 2000 and nobody really knows whether

08:04.920 --> 08:08.360
the country can continue on the right path after Kagame leaves.

08:08.360 --> 08:13.160
He himself even said that if he had not groomed a successor by 2017, quote, it means that

08:13.160 --> 08:16.200
I have not created capacity for a post-Me Rwanda.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.360
I see this as a personal failure.

08:18.360 --> 08:23.600
It's now well past 2017 and Kagame is still in power with no signs of leaving.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.560
Regardless of the reasons, though, for Rwanda's current political stability, it's sure that

08:27.560 --> 08:28.640
businesses like it.

08:28.640 --> 08:33.000
It's one of the top factors to look at when deciding which countries to operate in.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.520
The third factor that led to Singapore's business success, ease of doing business,

08:36.520 --> 08:41.560
is perhaps the most important one and it's also the one at which Rwanda most excels.

08:41.560 --> 08:46.040
This is a broad factor, but it's one that the World Bank tracks with a well-known indicator,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.020
the ease of doing business index.

08:48.020 --> 08:51.900
This looks at ten factors—ease of starting a business, dealing with construction permits,

08:51.900 --> 08:55.540
getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting minority investors,

08:55.540 --> 08:59.740
paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.940
Singapore ranks at number two in the world behind New Zealand and is followed up by Denmark,

09:03.940 --> 09:05.500
Hong Kong, and South Korea.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.660
Rwanda, meanwhile, scores as the 29th.

09:08.660 --> 09:12.580
This is an impressive score by itself but it is incredibly impressive when considering

09:12.580 --> 09:14.740
how the rest of the continent ranks up.

09:14.780 --> 09:19.160
Rwanda is by far the highest ranked among mainland African nations.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.560
The nearest trailing African nation is Morocco at number 60 and plenty of highly developed

09:23.560 --> 09:27.920
countries like the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan rank lower than Rwanda.

09:27.920 --> 09:32.020
To achieve this, Rwanda has made plenty of economic and legislative reforms to foster

09:32.020 --> 09:33.460
the business-friendly environment.

09:33.460 --> 09:37.500
They've also been focusing on building both soft and hard infrastructure.

09:37.500 --> 09:42.140
The government, in collaboration with private investors, built an enormous $300 million

09:42.140 --> 09:45.900
convention center along with a five-star Radisson Blu hotel to attract the convention

09:45.900 --> 09:50.380
market in addition to less flashy infrastructure projects building roads and airports.

09:50.380 --> 09:55.700
Overall, Rwanda is on the hunt for international investment in the country and so far, that's

09:55.700 --> 09:56.700
paid off.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.980
In 2005, $10.5 million were invested from abroad in Rwanda.

10:00.980 --> 10:05.740
In 2017, that number was $293 million.

10:05.740 --> 10:08.260
Clearly a lot is working in Rwanda.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.360
It's safe, clean, and growing economically.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.840
What more could a country want?

10:12.840 --> 10:18.080
Well, there are serious questions from abroad on whether Rwanda's growth is ethical, replicatable,

10:18.080 --> 10:20.020
sustainable, and even real.

10:20.020 --> 10:25.240
The way Rwanda has achieved its current stability and growth has some external observers condemning

10:25.240 --> 10:26.240
it.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.040
Appearances of Rwanda can also be deceiving.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.040
It is still one of the poorest countries in the world with the average resident earning

10:32.040 --> 10:34.880
only $750 a year.

10:34.880 --> 10:39.000
Some question whether the country should be spending so much on its airline, its infrastructure,

10:39.000 --> 10:42.560
and its capital when so many in the country are so poor.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.880
Some question whether the country is growing for its middle and upper class while leaving

10:45.880 --> 10:47.480
its rural poor behind.

10:47.480 --> 10:51.400
It's no surprise, though, that many of the country's neighbors, curbed by violence

10:51.400 --> 10:55.680
and poverty, have pondered whether they should be replicating the ways of Kagame.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.540
External observers have given mixed answers to that question.

10:58.540 --> 11:02.440
Some believe that the current authoritarian policies will let dissent bottle up and eventually

11:02.440 --> 11:03.440
explode.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.160
They worry that the country will erupt into violence again.

11:06.160 --> 11:09.800
Some say that the current regime is solely focused on making things seem like they're

11:09.800 --> 11:14.260
improving through climbing up in the indicators without making real, rational change.

11:14.260 --> 11:18.640
There are even some accusations that Rwandan GDP growth figures might be inflated or otherwise

11:18.640 --> 11:19.640
manipulated.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.500
It's sure that Rwanda has been growing enormously, but is it really this much?

11:24.500 --> 11:27.800
There is no one recipe for economic growth.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.420
The fact that the United States became the superpower of the 20th century and China is

11:31.420 --> 11:35.560
becoming the superpower of the 21st century proves that more than anything.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.640
Economic states grow and autocratic states grow.

11:37.640 --> 11:42.520
They might grow in different ways, but there are success stories on both ends of the spectrum.

11:42.520 --> 11:47.220
What external observers have so much trouble answering is the means to the end question.

11:47.220 --> 11:50.080
Should Rwanda's growth be lauded given how it has achieved?

11:50.080 --> 11:53.400
Can you tolerate some bad in exchange for much good?

11:53.400 --> 11:57.880
In the end, Rwanda is the country of Rwandans and they are the only ones that matter with

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
these questions.

11:58.880 --> 12:03.740
If Rwanda is truly working for all Rwandans, then Rwanda is working.

12:03.740 --> 12:08.340
There are a lot of ifs, but if Rwandan growth is sustainable, and if Rwandan politics are

12:08.340 --> 12:12.900
