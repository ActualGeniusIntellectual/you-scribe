00:00.000 --> 00:04.980
This is Every State in the US by Wendover Productions and made possible by the Great

00:04.980 --> 00:06.140
Courses Plus.

00:06.140 --> 00:09.780
We'll start with Alabama—the first state alphabetically.

00:09.780 --> 00:13.940
Magnolia Springs, Alabama is the only town in America to have their mail delivered by

00:13.940 --> 00:18.820
boat, although the longest mail delivery route in America is in rural Oklahoma where delivery

00:18.820 --> 00:25.620
drivers have to drive 187.6 miles each day to deliver the mail to around 200 houses.

00:25.620 --> 00:29.740
Oklahoma's state vegetable is the watermelon, which happens to be a fruit, and Oklahoma

00:29.800 --> 00:32.240
is also home to Kansas—the town.

00:32.240 --> 00:37.180
The real Kansas, or more specifically this point, is the geographic center of the contiguous

00:37.180 --> 00:38.620
United States.

00:38.620 --> 00:43.260
What Kansas is not home to is Kansas City which counterintuitively is in Missouri where

00:43.260 --> 00:47.940
the population center of the US is—the average location of every American.

00:47.940 --> 00:52.280
Missouri borders eight states and is therefore tied with Tennessee as the state that borders

00:52.280 --> 00:54.100
the most other states.

00:54.100 --> 00:58.340
Tennessee was a southern state that seceded from the United States and joined the confederacy

00:58.340 --> 01:03.060
except for Scott County which seceded from Tennessee and formed the unrecognized independent

01:03.060 --> 01:04.060
state.

01:04.060 --> 01:08.700
Scott County didn't actually officially rejoin Tennessee until 1986.

01:08.700 --> 01:12.620
Tennessee's western border was originally defined by the course of the Mississippi River

01:12.620 --> 01:16.580
which has since changed course which has led to all these enclaves and exclaves of the

01:16.580 --> 01:18.560
two states on the two sides of the river.

01:18.560 --> 01:24.000
The Arkansas River, a major tributary of the Mississippi, begins all the way in Colorado

01:24.000 --> 01:28.600
where nobody is entirely sure which mountain is the tallest—Mount Elbert or Mount Massive

01:28.600 --> 01:32.000
since their heights are within 10 feet of each other and people keep building piles

01:32.000 --> 01:35.240
of rocks on the summits to make one mountain taller than the other.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.280
Colorado is also home to America's longest continuous street, Colfax Avenue in Denver

01:40.280 --> 01:45.680
at 26 miles long, but the shortest individually named street in America is reportedly McKinley

01:45.680 --> 01:49.840
Street in Bellefontaine, Ohio at a mere 28 feet long.

01:50.080 --> 01:55.080
Ohio's northernmost point is actually north of Canada's southernmost point—Pelee Island.

01:55.080 --> 02:01.120
Pelee Island, Canada, in fact, is farther south than parts of 27 states, including California,

02:01.120 --> 02:05.560
which as a state has a higher population than the entire country of Canada.

02:05.560 --> 02:11.560
Los Angeles, California, despite being on the Pacific Ocean, is east of six state capitals,

02:11.560 --> 02:12.840
including Nevada's.

02:12.840 --> 02:17.760
Nevada has the point in the entire United States where you're farthest from a McDonald's—only

02:17.760 --> 02:22.600
116 miles, although Nevada is not the state with the fewest McDonald's.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.080
That title goes to the state with 29 McDonald's, North Dakota, which according to some legal

02:27.080 --> 02:32.300
experts wasn't technically a state until 2012 since their constitution was missing

02:32.300 --> 02:36.800
this sentence which meant it didn't fulfill the federal requirement for statehood.

02:36.800 --> 02:41.400
Despite having the fewest McDonald's, North Dakota is not America's least populated

02:41.400 --> 02:42.400
state.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.080
That's Wyoming, which has two sets of escalators in the entire state.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.160
Wyoming is well known for hosting Yellowstone National Park, although a bit of it spills

02:50.160 --> 02:54.240
over into Idaho, though in this section you can get away with murder.

02:54.240 --> 02:58.080
You see, with the sixth amendment, if you're placed on trial it's required that you are

02:58.080 --> 03:02.320
judged by a jury of your peers which means individuals from the same state and federal

03:02.320 --> 03:05.200
district as where the crime was committed.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.840
Yellowstone is its own federal district meaning you'd need residents from Yellowstone to

03:08.840 --> 03:12.760
be on the jury, although if you were in the Idaho part, you'd need Yellowstone residents

03:12.760 --> 03:14.520
from Idaho to be on the jury.

03:14.520 --> 03:19.000
Except this 50 square mile section is entirely uninhabited so they wouldn't be able to

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
form a jury which means you'd walk free.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.400
There's also one single road connecting the entire southern section of Idaho to the

03:25.400 --> 03:26.680
northern section.

03:26.680 --> 03:31.560
Idaho, with its fairly low population, has one single telephone area code for the whole

03:31.560 --> 03:33.880
state, just like neighboring Montana.

03:33.880 --> 03:39.240
Montana is home to the least busy commercial airport in the US, Dawson Community Airport,

03:39.240 --> 03:43.040
at 4,000 passengers per year or about 11 per day.

03:43.040 --> 03:48.320
Missoula, Montana is also home to the warehouse of DFTBA where you can buy one of these—a

03:48.320 --> 03:51.400
Wendover Productions t-shirts—for only $20.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.280
The link is in the description.

03:53.280 --> 03:59.800
The busiest airport in America is Atlanta's at 49 million passengers per year or 135,000

03:59.800 --> 04:00.800
per day.

04:00.800 --> 04:06.080
Peachtree, a suburb of Atlanta, is a community that has 90 miles of golf cart specific roads

04:06.080 --> 04:12.560
adjacent to its normal roads since 9,000 families here have golf carts as their second cars.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.920
Teachers are even encouraged to drive to school from the age of 12 in their golf carts.

04:16.920 --> 04:22.840
Georgia, or more specifically Springer Mountain, Georgia, is the start to the 2,200 mile long

04:22.840 --> 04:27.640
Appalachian Trail which is a hiking trail that terminates all the way up at Mount Katahdin,

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
Maine.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.580
Maine is the only state in America to only border one other state and it's also the

04:32.580 --> 04:34.360
closest state to Africa.

04:34.360 --> 04:36.780
Seriously, it's closer than Florida.

04:36.780 --> 04:41.960
The second closest state to Africa is Massachusetts, or more specifically Cape Cod, Massachusetts,

04:41.960 --> 04:46.960
which is technically an island since a man-made canal separates it from the mainland.

04:46.960 --> 04:50.800
Massachusetts is actually farther from Miami than Panama City is.

04:50.800 --> 04:55.680
And Miami is closer to the country capitals of Nassau, Bahama and Havana, Cuba than its

04:55.680 --> 04:58.000
own state capital, Tallahassee.

04:58.000 --> 05:04.240
Florida has the lowest highest point of any state—312 feet—23 times lower than South

05:04.240 --> 05:05.600
Dakota's highest point.

05:05.600 --> 05:10.280
South Dakota is home to the geographic center of the entire United States, if you include

05:10.280 --> 05:14.880
Alaska and Hawaii, and it was made a state a mere nine days before Washington which was

05:14.880 --> 05:17.320
called Columbia before it became a state.

05:17.320 --> 05:21.320
Its name was changed as to not confuse it with the District of Columbia, but obviously

05:21.320 --> 05:25.620
that didn't work out since DC City ended up being called Washington.

05:25.620 --> 05:30.120
Washington Place is the official residence of Hawaii's governor and Hawaii was given

05:30.120 --> 05:35.280
its own unique currency during World War II that was its only legal tender so that, in

05:35.280 --> 05:39.520
case the Japanese successfully invaded Hawaii, the federal government could declare all of

05:39.520 --> 05:43.120
Hawaii's currency worthless to prevent the Japanese from using it.

05:43.120 --> 05:48.680
The closest state to Hawaii is Alaska whose capital, Juneau, has no roads connecting it

05:48.680 --> 05:53.520
with the rest of Alaska or North America meaning you can't drive in or out.

05:53.520 --> 05:58.080
Alaska is also one of the four states that completely bans outdoor billboards along with

05:58.080 --> 06:03.780
Hawaii, Maine, and Vermont whose tallest building is only 11 stories tall—that's the shortest

06:03.780 --> 06:05.520
tallest building of any state.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.540
The tallest building in the states is Freedom Tower in New York.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.360
New York is home to Ellis Island, or at least part of it.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.780
Their territory is completely surrounded by New Jersey—similar to Liberty Island, home

06:15.780 --> 06:20.180
to the Statue of Liberty—which is completely surrounded by New Jersey waters which means

06:20.180 --> 06:24.180
you need to travel through New Jersey to get from New York to New York.

06:24.180 --> 06:28.900
Clinton Road in West Milford, New Jersey has America's longest red light—a full five

06:28.900 --> 06:30.100
minute wait.

06:30.100 --> 06:35.340
New Jersey actually goes surprisingly far south—farther south than Kentucky's northernmost

06:35.340 --> 06:36.340
point.

06:36.340 --> 06:40.220
In the northwest corner, Kentucky has a rather large piece of territory that's not actually

06:40.220 --> 06:42.420
connected to the rest of Kentucky.

06:42.420 --> 06:46.040
Kentucky was the birthplace of Lincoln who was later elected to the Illinois House of

06:46.040 --> 06:50.780
Representatives and in Illinois is the original Burger King, but it's not the Burger King

06:50.780 --> 06:52.100
you're thinking of.

06:52.100 --> 06:56.360
This Burger King existed before this Burger King and therefore sued Burger King when they

06:56.360 --> 07:00.940
came to Illinois for trademark infringement and won so now no Burger King is allowed to

07:00.940 --> 07:05.100
operate within a 20 mile radius of this original Burger King.

07:05.100 --> 07:10.260
Chicago, Illinois—America's third largest city—is just a tad bit larger than the fourth

07:10.260 --> 07:12.660
largest city—Houston, Texas.

07:12.660 --> 07:18.260
And Texas is so enormous that El Paso, Texas is closer to Los Angeles than it is to Houston,

07:18.260 --> 07:19.260
Texas.

07:19.260 --> 07:22.780
Texas' northernmost point is also closer to Michigan than it is to its southernmost

07:22.780 --> 07:23.780
point.

07:23.780 --> 07:28.420
From Detroit, Michigan, you actually end up in Canada if you travel due south and Michigan

07:28.420 --> 07:32.820
is the only state to be made of two entirely separated sections.

07:32.820 --> 07:38.220
Michigan's highway 185 is actually a bike path making it the only official highway in

07:38.220 --> 07:40.420
America where cars are banned.

07:40.420 --> 07:45.260
Michigan's upper peninsula is also only connected by land to Wisconsin which is home

07:45.260 --> 07:49.800
to the Green Bay Packers—a team so popular that the waiting list for season tickets is

07:49.800 --> 07:51.260
30 years long.

07:51.260 --> 07:55.420
It's so long that it's common for parents to put their kid's name on the list as soon

07:55.420 --> 07:56.580
as they're born.

07:56.580 --> 08:01.860
In Watertown, Wisconsin is Utah Street, but the real Utah has the longest section of interstate

08:01.900 --> 08:06.940
in the US with no gas stations—106 miles on I-70.

08:06.940 --> 08:12.980
I-70 ends over 2,000 miles away in Baltimore, Maryland and the entire state of Maryland

08:12.980 --> 08:15.300
has zero natural lakes.

08:15.300 --> 08:20.020
It also has this panhandle that reaches a minimum width of 1.8 miles before expanding

08:20.020 --> 08:25.180
back out to 30 miles width out near West Virginia which is definitively a southern state but

08:25.180 --> 08:30.540
also has this panhandle that reaches as far north as New York City and Nebraska.

08:30.540 --> 08:35.380
Minoie, Nebraska is the only incorporated municipality in the United States that has

08:35.380 --> 08:37.260
a population of one.

08:37.260 --> 08:42.380
The one resident, Elsie Eyler, is mayor and runs the library and tavern which is granted

08:42.380 --> 08:45.500
a liquor license every year by Elsie herself.

08:45.500 --> 08:50.460
Tortilla Flat, Arizona is six times larger than Minoie since it has six residents and

08:50.460 --> 08:55.620
Arizona also has one quarter of the Four Corners monument—the only point where four states

08:55.620 --> 09:01.600
meet in the US—Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico which as a state, by law, still

09:01.600 --> 09:03.600
recognizes Pluto as a planet.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.220
New Mexico is typically the last state to vote in presidential primaries whereas Iowa

09:08.220 --> 09:09.620
is usually the first.

09:09.620 --> 09:15.420
Iowa is the only state in the US whose eastern and western borders are both water—in this

09:15.420 --> 09:16.640
case rivers.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.660
The eastern border is the Mississippi River which happens to be the namesake for Mississippi.

09:21.660 --> 09:27.900
The Mississippi River also flowed backwards for a full 24 hours in 2012 during Hurricane

09:27.900 --> 09:32.020
Isaac but the Mississippi doesn't actually reach the ocean in Mississippi.

09:32.020 --> 09:37.380
It does so in Louisiana, home to the longest bridge over water in the world at 24 miles.

09:37.380 --> 09:43.020
That's so long that for 8 of those miles you can't even see land on either side.

09:43.020 --> 09:47.460
One of the other longest bridges in the US is in North Carolina—the Virginia Dare Memorial

09:47.460 --> 09:51.760
Bridge which carries cars out to Kitty Hawk where the Wright brothers successfully flew

09:51.760 --> 09:55.500
a heavier than air aircraft for the first time in history.

09:55.500 --> 10:01.940
It was a 12 second, 120 foot flight—that's shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747.

10:01.940 --> 10:06.060
North Carolina's southern neighbor is South Carolina although South Carolina isn't all

10:06.060 --> 10:10.680
that south since more than half of it is north of North Carolina's southernmost point and

10:10.680 --> 10:15.180
South Carolina also has a town called North making it North South Carolina.

10:15.180 --> 10:19.460
South Carolina was the site of the first civil war battle and the civil war ended up having

10:19.460 --> 10:25.260
a total of one battle over in Indiana where the Indy 500 Speedway is which is so enormous

10:25.260 --> 10:29.220
that you could comfortably fit the entire country of the Vatican inside it.

10:29.220 --> 10:35.620
It can also fit 400,000 people which is the highest capacity of any sports arena in the

10:35.620 --> 10:36.620
world.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.900
Indiana's state beverage is water while Oregon's is milk.

10:39.900 --> 10:44.280
Portland, Oregon is also home to the world's smallest park according to the Guinness World

10:44.280 --> 10:46.520
Records book—mill and park.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.880
Oregon is also one of the few states to not have a sales tax along with New Hampshire—the

10:50.880 --> 10:54.400
only state to have no law requiring adults to wear seatbelts.

10:54.400 --> 10:58.180
Connecticut Lake, in New Hampshire, is the source of the Connecticut River which is what

10:58.180 --> 11:00.760
Connecticut the state is named after.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.520
Hartford Connecticut's airport, at less than 3 million passengers per year, is the

11:04.520 --> 11:08.280
smallest airport in the US to have a direct flight to Europe.

11:08.280 --> 11:12.320
Delaware, on the other hand, certainly doesn't have a direct flight to Europe since it's

11:12.320 --> 11:17.180
the only state that you can't fly to—there's not one commercial flight in or out of this

11:17.180 --> 11:18.180
tiny state.

11:18.180 --> 11:23.080
It's the second smallest state behind Rhode Island which is so small that the entire state

11:23.080 --> 11:25.440
grows by 3% during low tide.

11:25.440 --> 11:30.000
Rhode Island's second largest city, Warwick, shares its name with Warwick, Pennsylvania

11:30.000 --> 11:35.720
and in Pennsylvania is Centralia where the ground has been on fire since 1962 due to

11:35.720 --> 11:41.120
a coal mine fire and it's expected to burn for over 200 years.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.720
Pennsylvania borders Minnesota, well not really, but Pennsylvania Avenue does intersect

11:45.720 --> 11:50.560
Minnesota Avenue in DC and Minnesota is home to the northernmost point in the lower 48.

11:50.560 --> 11:56.120
You see, most of the US-Canada border is defined by the 49th parallel, but a surveying error

11:56.120 --> 11:57.240
led to this.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.260
The couple hundred residents of this area, called the Northwest Angle, are completely

12:01.260 --> 12:05.880
cut off from the US and need to pass into Canada then back into the United States to

12:05.880 --> 12:07.160
go to school.

12:07.160 --> 12:12.200
Also in northern Minnesota is Virginia—the town—but Virginia, the state, is massive.

12:12.200 --> 12:16.840
So massive that Ewing, Virginia is closer to eight other state capitals than to its

12:16.840 --> 12:18.840
own state capital—Richmond.

12:18.840 --> 12:24.240
Alexandria, Virginia is actually closer to Toronto, Canada than it is to Ewing, Virginia.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.620
Virginia also happens to go farther west than West Virginia.

12:27.620 --> 12:31.720
Virginia is also home to this place—the headquarters of the teaching company who run

12:31.720 --> 12:36.320
the Great Courses Plus and with that super smooth transition I do have to thank the Great

12:36.320 --> 12:38.660
Courses Plus for sponsoring this video.

12:38.660 --> 12:42.600
The Great Courses Plus is a subscription video on-demand learning service where you can watch

12:42.600 --> 12:48.240
top-notch lectures from experts from Ivy League universities, National Geographic, the Smithsonian,

12:48.240 --> 12:51.720
the Culinary Institute of America, and more well-known institutions.

12:51.720 --> 12:56.680
They have a library of over 7,000 lectures about pretty much anything and everything.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.080
You can learn how to cook, how to play chess, become a better photographer—pretty much

13:00.080 --> 13:02.800
anything you want to learn, they have a lecture on it.

13:02.800 --> 13:06.900
I personally really enjoyed a course by National Geographic called National Geographic Polar

13:06.900 --> 13:12.000
Explorations which teaches all about the science, history, and culture of the polar regions.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.600
If you want to learn about this or any of the hundreds of other topics they have, you

13:15.600 --> 13:20.880
can do so for free for a month by signing up at thegreatcoursesplus.com slash wendover.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.320
