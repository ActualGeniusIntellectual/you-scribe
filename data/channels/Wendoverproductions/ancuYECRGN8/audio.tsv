0	4980	This is Every State in the US by Wendover Productions and made possible by the Great
4980	6140	Courses Plus.
6140	9780	We'll start with Alabama—the first state alphabetically.
9780	13940	Magnolia Springs, Alabama is the only town in America to have their mail delivered by
13940	18820	boat, although the longest mail delivery route in America is in rural Oklahoma where delivery
18820	25620	drivers have to drive 187.6 miles each day to deliver the mail to around 200 houses.
25620	29740	Oklahoma's state vegetable is the watermelon, which happens to be a fruit, and Oklahoma
29800	32240	is also home to Kansas—the town.
32240	37180	The real Kansas, or more specifically this point, is the geographic center of the contiguous
37180	38620	United States.
38620	43260	What Kansas is not home to is Kansas City which counterintuitively is in Missouri where
43260	47940	the population center of the US is—the average location of every American.
47940	52280	Missouri borders eight states and is therefore tied with Tennessee as the state that borders
52280	54100	the most other states.
54100	58340	Tennessee was a southern state that seceded from the United States and joined the confederacy
58340	63060	except for Scott County which seceded from Tennessee and formed the unrecognized independent
63060	64060	state.
64060	68700	Scott County didn't actually officially rejoin Tennessee until 1986.
68700	72620	Tennessee's western border was originally defined by the course of the Mississippi River
72620	76580	which has since changed course which has led to all these enclaves and exclaves of the
76580	78560	two states on the two sides of the river.
78560	84000	The Arkansas River, a major tributary of the Mississippi, begins all the way in Colorado
84000	88600	where nobody is entirely sure which mountain is the tallest—Mount Elbert or Mount Massive
88600	92000	since their heights are within 10 feet of each other and people keep building piles
92000	95240	of rocks on the summits to make one mountain taller than the other.
95240	100280	Colorado is also home to America's longest continuous street, Colfax Avenue in Denver
100280	105680	at 26 miles long, but the shortest individually named street in America is reportedly McKinley
105680	109840	Street in Bellefontaine, Ohio at a mere 28 feet long.
110080	115080	Ohio's northernmost point is actually north of Canada's southernmost point—Pelee Island.
115080	121120	Pelee Island, Canada, in fact, is farther south than parts of 27 states, including California,
121120	125560	which as a state has a higher population than the entire country of Canada.
125560	131560	Los Angeles, California, despite being on the Pacific Ocean, is east of six state capitals,
131560	132840	including Nevada's.
132840	137760	Nevada has the point in the entire United States where you're farthest from a McDonald's—only
137760	142600	116 miles, although Nevada is not the state with the fewest McDonald's.
142600	147080	That title goes to the state with 29 McDonald's, North Dakota, which according to some legal
147080	152300	experts wasn't technically a state until 2012 since their constitution was missing
152300	156800	this sentence which meant it didn't fulfill the federal requirement for statehood.
156800	161400	Despite having the fewest McDonald's, North Dakota is not America's least populated
161400	162400	state.
162400	166080	That's Wyoming, which has two sets of escalators in the entire state.
166320	170160	Wyoming is well known for hosting Yellowstone National Park, although a bit of it spills
170160	174240	over into Idaho, though in this section you can get away with murder.
174240	178080	You see, with the sixth amendment, if you're placed on trial it's required that you are
178080	182320	judged by a jury of your peers which means individuals from the same state and federal
182320	185200	district as where the crime was committed.
185200	188840	Yellowstone is its own federal district meaning you'd need residents from Yellowstone to
188840	192760	be on the jury, although if you were in the Idaho part, you'd need Yellowstone residents
192760	194520	from Idaho to be on the jury.
194520	199000	Except this 50 square mile section is entirely uninhabited so they wouldn't be able to
199000	201000	form a jury which means you'd walk free.
201000	205400	There's also one single road connecting the entire southern section of Idaho to the
205400	206680	northern section.
206680	211560	Idaho, with its fairly low population, has one single telephone area code for the whole
211560	213880	state, just like neighboring Montana.
213880	219240	Montana is home to the least busy commercial airport in the US, Dawson Community Airport,
219240	223040	at 4,000 passengers per year or about 11 per day.
223040	228320	Missoula, Montana is also home to the warehouse of DFTBA where you can buy one of these—a
228320	231400	Wendover Productions t-shirts—for only $20.
231400	233280	The link is in the description.
233280	239800	The busiest airport in America is Atlanta's at 49 million passengers per year or 135,000
239800	240800	per day.
240800	246080	Peachtree, a suburb of Atlanta, is a community that has 90 miles of golf cart specific roads
246080	252560	adjacent to its normal roads since 9,000 families here have golf carts as their second cars.
252600	256920	Teachers are even encouraged to drive to school from the age of 12 in their golf carts.
256920	262840	Georgia, or more specifically Springer Mountain, Georgia, is the start to the 2,200 mile long
262840	267640	Appalachian Trail which is a hiking trail that terminates all the way up at Mount Katahdin,
267640	268640	Maine.
268640	272580	Maine is the only state in America to only border one other state and it's also the
272580	274360	closest state to Africa.
274360	276780	Seriously, it's closer than Florida.
276780	281960	The second closest state to Africa is Massachusetts, or more specifically Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
281960	286960	which is technically an island since a man-made canal separates it from the mainland.
286960	290800	Massachusetts is actually farther from Miami than Panama City is.
290800	295680	And Miami is closer to the country capitals of Nassau, Bahama and Havana, Cuba than its
295680	298000	own state capital, Tallahassee.
298000	304240	Florida has the lowest highest point of any state—312 feet—23 times lower than South
304240	305600	Dakota's highest point.
305600	310280	South Dakota is home to the geographic center of the entire United States, if you include
310280	314880	Alaska and Hawaii, and it was made a state a mere nine days before Washington which was
314880	317320	called Columbia before it became a state.
317320	321320	Its name was changed as to not confuse it with the District of Columbia, but obviously
321320	325620	that didn't work out since DC City ended up being called Washington.
325620	330120	Washington Place is the official residence of Hawaii's governor and Hawaii was given
330120	335280	its own unique currency during World War II that was its only legal tender so that, in
335280	339520	case the Japanese successfully invaded Hawaii, the federal government could declare all of
339520	343120	Hawaii's currency worthless to prevent the Japanese from using it.
343120	348680	The closest state to Hawaii is Alaska whose capital, Juneau, has no roads connecting it
348680	353520	with the rest of Alaska or North America meaning you can't drive in or out.
353520	358080	Alaska is also one of the four states that completely bans outdoor billboards along with
358080	363780	Hawaii, Maine, and Vermont whose tallest building is only 11 stories tall—that's the shortest
363780	365520	tallest building of any state.
365520	368540	The tallest building in the states is Freedom Tower in New York.
368540	371360	New York is home to Ellis Island, or at least part of it.
371360	375780	Their territory is completely surrounded by New Jersey—similar to Liberty Island, home
375780	380180	to the Statue of Liberty—which is completely surrounded by New Jersey waters which means
380180	384180	you need to travel through New Jersey to get from New York to New York.
384180	388900	Clinton Road in West Milford, New Jersey has America's longest red light—a full five
388900	390100	minute wait.
390100	395340	New Jersey actually goes surprisingly far south—farther south than Kentucky's northernmost
395340	396340	point.
396340	400220	In the northwest corner, Kentucky has a rather large piece of territory that's not actually
400220	402420	connected to the rest of Kentucky.
402420	406040	Kentucky was the birthplace of Lincoln who was later elected to the Illinois House of
406040	410780	Representatives and in Illinois is the original Burger King, but it's not the Burger King
410780	412100	you're thinking of.
412100	416360	This Burger King existed before this Burger King and therefore sued Burger King when they
416360	420940	came to Illinois for trademark infringement and won so now no Burger King is allowed to
420940	425100	operate within a 20 mile radius of this original Burger King.
425100	430260	Chicago, Illinois—America's third largest city—is just a tad bit larger than the fourth
430260	432660	largest city—Houston, Texas.
432660	438260	And Texas is so enormous that El Paso, Texas is closer to Los Angeles than it is to Houston,
438260	439260	Texas.
439260	442780	Texas' northernmost point is also closer to Michigan than it is to its southernmost
442780	443780	point.
443780	448420	From Detroit, Michigan, you actually end up in Canada if you travel due south and Michigan
448420	452820	is the only state to be made of two entirely separated sections.
452820	458220	Michigan's highway 185 is actually a bike path making it the only official highway in
458220	460420	America where cars are banned.
460420	465260	Michigan's upper peninsula is also only connected by land to Wisconsin which is home
465260	469800	to the Green Bay Packers—a team so popular that the waiting list for season tickets is
469800	471260	30 years long.
471260	475420	It's so long that it's common for parents to put their kid's name on the list as soon
475420	476580	as they're born.
476580	481860	In Watertown, Wisconsin is Utah Street, but the real Utah has the longest section of interstate
481900	486940	in the US with no gas stations—106 miles on I-70.
486940	492980	I-70 ends over 2,000 miles away in Baltimore, Maryland and the entire state of Maryland
492980	495300	has zero natural lakes.
495300	500020	It also has this panhandle that reaches a minimum width of 1.8 miles before expanding
500020	505180	back out to 30 miles width out near West Virginia which is definitively a southern state but
505180	510540	also has this panhandle that reaches as far north as New York City and Nebraska.
510540	515380	Minoie, Nebraska is the only incorporated municipality in the United States that has
515380	517260	a population of one.
517260	522380	The one resident, Elsie Eyler, is mayor and runs the library and tavern which is granted
522380	525500	a liquor license every year by Elsie herself.
525500	530460	Tortilla Flat, Arizona is six times larger than Minoie since it has six residents and
530460	535620	Arizona also has one quarter of the Four Corners monument—the only point where four states
535620	541600	meet in the US—Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico which as a state, by law, still
541600	543600	recognizes Pluto as a planet.
543600	548220	New Mexico is typically the last state to vote in presidential primaries whereas Iowa
548220	549620	is usually the first.
549620	555420	Iowa is the only state in the US whose eastern and western borders are both water—in this
555420	556640	case rivers.
556640	561660	The eastern border is the Mississippi River which happens to be the namesake for Mississippi.
561660	567900	The Mississippi River also flowed backwards for a full 24 hours in 2012 during Hurricane
567900	572020	Isaac but the Mississippi doesn't actually reach the ocean in Mississippi.
572020	577380	It does so in Louisiana, home to the longest bridge over water in the world at 24 miles.
577380	583020	That's so long that for 8 of those miles you can't even see land on either side.
583020	587460	One of the other longest bridges in the US is in North Carolina—the Virginia Dare Memorial
587460	591760	Bridge which carries cars out to Kitty Hawk where the Wright brothers successfully flew
591760	595500	a heavier than air aircraft for the first time in history.
595500	601940	It was a 12 second, 120 foot flight—that's shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747.
601940	606060	North Carolina's southern neighbor is South Carolina although South Carolina isn't all
606060	610680	that south since more than half of it is north of North Carolina's southernmost point and
610680	615180	South Carolina also has a town called North making it North South Carolina.
615180	619460	South Carolina was the site of the first civil war battle and the civil war ended up having
619460	625260	a total of one battle over in Indiana where the Indy 500 Speedway is which is so enormous
625260	629220	that you could comfortably fit the entire country of the Vatican inside it.
629220	635620	It can also fit 400,000 people which is the highest capacity of any sports arena in the
635620	636620	world.
636620	639900	Indiana's state beverage is water while Oregon's is milk.
639900	644280	Portland, Oregon is also home to the world's smallest park according to the Guinness World
644280	646520	Records book—mill and park.
646520	650880	Oregon is also one of the few states to not have a sales tax along with New Hampshire—the
650880	654400	only state to have no law requiring adults to wear seatbelts.
654400	658180	Connecticut Lake, in New Hampshire, is the source of the Connecticut River which is what
658180	660760	Connecticut the state is named after.
660760	664520	Hartford Connecticut's airport, at less than 3 million passengers per year, is the
664520	668280	smallest airport in the US to have a direct flight to Europe.
668280	672320	Delaware, on the other hand, certainly doesn't have a direct flight to Europe since it's
672320	677180	the only state that you can't fly to—there's not one commercial flight in or out of this
677180	678180	tiny state.
678180	683080	It's the second smallest state behind Rhode Island which is so small that the entire state
683080	685440	grows by 3% during low tide.
685440	690000	Rhode Island's second largest city, Warwick, shares its name with Warwick, Pennsylvania
690000	695720	and in Pennsylvania is Centralia where the ground has been on fire since 1962 due to
695720	701120	a coal mine fire and it's expected to burn for over 200 years.
701120	705720	Pennsylvania borders Minnesota, well not really, but Pennsylvania Avenue does intersect
705720	710560	Minnesota Avenue in DC and Minnesota is home to the northernmost point in the lower 48.
710560	716120	You see, most of the US-Canada border is defined by the 49th parallel, but a surveying error
716120	717240	led to this.
717240	721260	The couple hundred residents of this area, called the Northwest Angle, are completely
721260	725880	cut off from the US and need to pass into Canada then back into the United States to
725880	727160	go to school.
727160	732200	Also in northern Minnesota is Virginia—the town—but Virginia, the state, is massive.
732200	736840	So massive that Ewing, Virginia is closer to eight other state capitals than to its
736840	738840	own state capital—Richmond.
738840	744240	Alexandria, Virginia is actually closer to Toronto, Canada than it is to Ewing, Virginia.
744240	747620	Virginia also happens to go farther west than West Virginia.
747620	751720	Virginia is also home to this place—the headquarters of the teaching company who run
751720	756320	the Great Courses Plus and with that super smooth transition I do have to thank the Great
756320	758660	Courses Plus for sponsoring this video.
758660	762600	The Great Courses Plus is a subscription video on-demand learning service where you can watch
762600	768240	top-notch lectures from experts from Ivy League universities, National Geographic, the Smithsonian,
768240	771720	the Culinary Institute of America, and more well-known institutions.
771720	776680	They have a library of over 7,000 lectures about pretty much anything and everything.
776680	780080	You can learn how to cook, how to play chess, become a better photographer—pretty much
780080	782800	anything you want to learn, they have a lecture on it.
782800	786900	I personally really enjoyed a course by National Geographic called National Geographic Polar
786900	792000	Explorations which teaches all about the science, history, and culture of the polar regions.
792000	795600	If you want to learn about this or any of the hundreds of other topics they have, you
795600	800880	can do so for free for a month by signing up at thegreatcoursesplus.com slash wendover.
