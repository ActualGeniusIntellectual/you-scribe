00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,980
This is Every State in the US by Wendover Productions and made possible by the Great

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,140
Courses Plus.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,780
We'll start with Alabama—the first state alphabetically.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,940
Magnolia Springs, Alabama is the only town in America to have their mail delivered by

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,820
boat, although the longest mail delivery route in America is in rural Oklahoma where delivery

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:25,620
drivers have to drive 187.6 miles each day to deliver the mail to around 200 houses.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,740
Oklahoma's state vegetable is the watermelon, which happens to be a fruit, and Oklahoma

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,240
is also home to Kansas—the town.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,180
The real Kansas, or more specifically this point, is the geographic center of the contiguous

10
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,620
United States.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,260
What Kansas is not home to is Kansas City which counterintuitively is in Missouri where

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,940
the population center of the US is—the average location of every American.

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,280
Missouri borders eight states and is therefore tied with Tennessee as the state that borders

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,100
the most other states.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,340
Tennessee was a southern state that seceded from the United States and joined the confederacy

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,060
except for Scott County which seceded from Tennessee and formed the unrecognized independent

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,060
state.

18
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:08,700
Scott County didn't actually officially rejoin Tennessee until 1986.

19
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,620
Tennessee's western border was originally defined by the course of the Mississippi River

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,580
which has since changed course which has led to all these enclaves and exclaves of the

21
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,560
two states on the two sides of the river.

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,000
The Arkansas River, a major tributary of the Mississippi, begins all the way in Colorado

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,600
where nobody is entirely sure which mountain is the tallest—Mount Elbert or Mount Massive

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,000
since their heights are within 10 feet of each other and people keep building piles

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,240
of rocks on the summits to make one mountain taller than the other.

26
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,280
Colorado is also home to America's longest continuous street, Colfax Avenue in Denver

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,680
at 26 miles long, but the shortest individually named street in America is reportedly McKinley

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
Street in Bellefontaine, Ohio at a mere 28 feet long.

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Ohio's northernmost point is actually north of Canada's southernmost point—Pelee Island.

30
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,120
Pelee Island, Canada, in fact, is farther south than parts of 27 states, including California,

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,560
which as a state has a higher population than the entire country of Canada.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Los Angeles, California, despite being on the Pacific Ocean, is east of six state capitals,

33
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,840
including Nevada's.

34
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,760
Nevada has the point in the entire United States where you're farthest from a McDonald's—only

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,600
116 miles, although Nevada is not the state with the fewest McDonald's.

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,080
That title goes to the state with 29 McDonald's, North Dakota, which according to some legal

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,300
experts wasn't technically a state until 2012 since their constitution was missing

38
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:36,800
this sentence which meant it didn't fulfill the federal requirement for statehood.

39
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Despite having the fewest McDonald's, North Dakota is not America's least populated

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
state.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,080
That's Wyoming, which has two sets of escalators in the entire state.

42
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,160
Wyoming is well known for hosting Yellowstone National Park, although a bit of it spills

43
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,240
over into Idaho, though in this section you can get away with murder.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,080
You see, with the sixth amendment, if you're placed on trial it's required that you are

45
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,320
judged by a jury of your peers which means individuals from the same state and federal

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,200
district as where the crime was committed.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,840
Yellowstone is its own federal district meaning you'd need residents from Yellowstone to

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,760
be on the jury, although if you were in the Idaho part, you'd need Yellowstone residents

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
from Idaho to be on the jury.

50
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,000
Except this 50 square mile section is entirely uninhabited so they wouldn't be able to

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
form a jury which means you'd walk free.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,400
There's also one single road connecting the entire southern section of Idaho to the

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,680
northern section.

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,560
Idaho, with its fairly low population, has one single telephone area code for the whole

55
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,880
state, just like neighboring Montana.

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,240
Montana is home to the least busy commercial airport in the US, Dawson Community Airport,

57
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,040
at 4,000 passengers per year or about 11 per day.

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,320
Missoula, Montana is also home to the warehouse of DFTBA where you can buy one of these—a

59
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,400
Wendover Productions t-shirts—for only $20.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,280
The link is in the description.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,800
The busiest airport in America is Atlanta's at 49 million passengers per year or 135,000

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
per day.

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,080
Peachtree, a suburb of Atlanta, is a community that has 90 miles of golf cart specific roads

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,560
adjacent to its normal roads since 9,000 families here have golf carts as their second cars.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,920
Teachers are even encouraged to drive to school from the age of 12 in their golf carts.

66
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:22,840
Georgia, or more specifically Springer Mountain, Georgia, is the start to the 2,200 mile long

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,640
Appalachian Trail which is a hiking trail that terminates all the way up at Mount Katahdin,

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,640
Maine.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,580
Maine is the only state in America to only border one other state and it's also the

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,360
closest state to Africa.

71
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,780
Seriously, it's closer than Florida.

72
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,960
The second closest state to Africa is Massachusetts, or more specifically Cape Cod, Massachusetts,

73
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,960
which is technically an island since a man-made canal separates it from the mainland.

74
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
Massachusetts is actually farther from Miami than Panama City is.

75
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,680
And Miami is closer to the country capitals of Nassau, Bahama and Havana, Cuba than its

76
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
own state capital, Tallahassee.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,240
Florida has the lowest highest point of any state—312 feet—23 times lower than South

78
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,600
Dakota's highest point.

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,280
South Dakota is home to the geographic center of the entire United States, if you include

80
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,880
Alaska and Hawaii, and it was made a state a mere nine days before Washington which was

81
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,320
called Columbia before it became a state.

82
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Its name was changed as to not confuse it with the District of Columbia, but obviously

83
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,620
that didn't work out since DC City ended up being called Washington.

84
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,120
Washington Place is the official residence of Hawaii's governor and Hawaii was given

85
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,280
its own unique currency during World War II that was its only legal tender so that, in

86
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,520
case the Japanese successfully invaded Hawaii, the federal government could declare all of

87
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,120
Hawaii's currency worthless to prevent the Japanese from using it.

88
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,680
The closest state to Hawaii is Alaska whose capital, Juneau, has no roads connecting it

89
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,520
with the rest of Alaska or North America meaning you can't drive in or out.

90
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,080
Alaska is also one of the four states that completely bans outdoor billboards along with

91
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,780
Hawaii, Maine, and Vermont whose tallest building is only 11 stories tall—that's the shortest

92
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,520
tallest building of any state.

93
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,540
The tallest building in the states is Freedom Tower in New York.

94
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,360
New York is home to Ellis Island, or at least part of it.

95
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,780
Their territory is completely surrounded by New Jersey—similar to Liberty Island, home

96
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,180
to the Statue of Liberty—which is completely surrounded by New Jersey waters which means

97
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,180
you need to travel through New Jersey to get from New York to New York.

98
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,900
Clinton Road in West Milford, New Jersey has America's longest red light—a full five

99
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,100
minute wait.

100
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,340
New Jersey actually goes surprisingly far south—farther south than Kentucky's northernmost

101
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
point.

102
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,220
In the northwest corner, Kentucky has a rather large piece of territory that's not actually

103
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,420
connected to the rest of Kentucky.

104
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,040
Kentucky was the birthplace of Lincoln who was later elected to the Illinois House of

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,780
Representatives and in Illinois is the original Burger King, but it's not the Burger King

106
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,100
you're thinking of.

107
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,360
This Burger King existed before this Burger King and therefore sued Burger King when they

108
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,940
came to Illinois for trademark infringement and won so now no Burger King is allowed to

109
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,100
operate within a 20 mile radius of this original Burger King.

110
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,260
Chicago, Illinois—America's third largest city—is just a tad bit larger than the fourth

111
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,660
largest city—Houston, Texas.

112
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,260
And Texas is so enormous that El Paso, Texas is closer to Los Angeles than it is to Houston,

113
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
Texas.

114
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,780
Texas' northernmost point is also closer to Michigan than it is to its southernmost

115
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,780
point.

116
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,420
From Detroit, Michigan, you actually end up in Canada if you travel due south and Michigan

117
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,820
is the only state to be made of two entirely separated sections.

118
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,220
Michigan's highway 185 is actually a bike path making it the only official highway in

119
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,420
America where cars are banned.

120
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:45,260
Michigan's upper peninsula is also only connected by land to Wisconsin which is home

121
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,800
to the Green Bay Packers—a team so popular that the waiting list for season tickets is

122
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,260
30 years long.

123
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,420
It's so long that it's common for parents to put their kid's name on the list as soon

124
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,580
as they're born.

125
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,860
In Watertown, Wisconsin is Utah Street, but the real Utah has the longest section of interstate

126
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,940
in the US with no gas stations—106 miles on I-70.

127
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:12,980
I-70 ends over 2,000 miles away in Baltimore, Maryland and the entire state of Maryland

128
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,300
has zero natural lakes.

129
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,020
It also has this panhandle that reaches a minimum width of 1.8 miles before expanding

130
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,180
back out to 30 miles width out near West Virginia which is definitively a southern state but

131
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,540
also has this panhandle that reaches as far north as New York City and Nebraska.

132
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,380
Minoie, Nebraska is the only incorporated municipality in the United States that has

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,260
a population of one.

134
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,380
The one resident, Elsie Eyler, is mayor and runs the library and tavern which is granted

135
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,500
a liquor license every year by Elsie herself.

136
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,460
Tortilla Flat, Arizona is six times larger than Minoie since it has six residents and

137
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,620
Arizona also has one quarter of the Four Corners monument—the only point where four states

138
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,600
meet in the US—Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico which as a state, by law, still

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
recognizes Pluto as a planet.

140
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,220
New Mexico is typically the last state to vote in presidential primaries whereas Iowa

141
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,620
is usually the first.

142
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,420
Iowa is the only state in the US whose eastern and western borders are both water—in this

143
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,640
case rivers.

144
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,660
The eastern border is the Mississippi River which happens to be the namesake for Mississippi.

145
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,900
The Mississippi River also flowed backwards for a full 24 hours in 2012 during Hurricane

146
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,020
Isaac but the Mississippi doesn't actually reach the ocean in Mississippi.

147
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,380
It does so in Louisiana, home to the longest bridge over water in the world at 24 miles.

148
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:43,020
That's so long that for 8 of those miles you can't even see land on either side.

149
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,460
One of the other longest bridges in the US is in North Carolina—the Virginia Dare Memorial

150
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,760
Bridge which carries cars out to Kitty Hawk where the Wright brothers successfully flew

151
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,500
a heavier than air aircraft for the first time in history.

152
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,940
It was a 12 second, 120 foot flight—that's shorter than the wingspan of a Boeing 747.

153
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,060
North Carolina's southern neighbor is South Carolina although South Carolina isn't all

154
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,680
that south since more than half of it is north of North Carolina's southernmost point and

155
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,180
South Carolina also has a town called North making it North South Carolina.

156
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,460
South Carolina was the site of the first civil war battle and the civil war ended up having

157
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,260
a total of one battle over in Indiana where the Indy 500 Speedway is which is so enormous

158
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,220
that you could comfortably fit the entire country of the Vatican inside it.

159
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,620
It can also fit 400,000 people which is the highest capacity of any sports arena in the

160
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
world.

161
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,900
Indiana's state beverage is water while Oregon's is milk.

162
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,280
Portland, Oregon is also home to the world's smallest park according to the Guinness World

163
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,520
Records book—mill and park.

164
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,880
Oregon is also one of the few states to not have a sales tax along with New Hampshire—the

165
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,400
only state to have no law requiring adults to wear seatbelts.

166
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,180
Connecticut Lake, in New Hampshire, is the source of the Connecticut River which is what

167
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,760
Connecticut the state is named after.

168
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,520
Hartford Connecticut's airport, at less than 3 million passengers per year, is the

169
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,280
smallest airport in the US to have a direct flight to Europe.

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,320
Delaware, on the other hand, certainly doesn't have a direct flight to Europe since it's

171
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,180
the only state that you can't fly to—there's not one commercial flight in or out of this

172
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,180
tiny state.

173
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,080
It's the second smallest state behind Rhode Island which is so small that the entire state

174
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,440
grows by 3% during low tide.

175
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,000
Rhode Island's second largest city, Warwick, shares its name with Warwick, Pennsylvania

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,720
and in Pennsylvania is Centralia where the ground has been on fire since 1962 due to

177
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,120
a coal mine fire and it's expected to burn for over 200 years.

178
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,720
Pennsylvania borders Minnesota, well not really, but Pennsylvania Avenue does intersect

179
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,560
Minnesota Avenue in DC and Minnesota is home to the northernmost point in the lower 48.

180
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,120
You see, most of the US-Canada border is defined by the 49th parallel, but a surveying error

181
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,240
led to this.

182
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,260
The couple hundred residents of this area, called the Northwest Angle, are completely

183
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:05,880
cut off from the US and need to pass into Canada then back into the United States to

184
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,160
go to school.

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:12,200
Also in northern Minnesota is Virginia—the town—but Virginia, the state, is massive.

186
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,840
So massive that Ewing, Virginia is closer to eight other state capitals than to its

187
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,840
own state capital—Richmond.

188
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,240
Alexandria, Virginia is actually closer to Toronto, Canada than it is to Ewing, Virginia.

189
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,620
Virginia also happens to go farther west than West Virginia.

190
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,720
Virginia is also home to this place—the headquarters of the teaching company who run

191
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,320
the Great Courses Plus and with that super smooth transition I do have to thank the Great

192
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,660
Courses Plus for sponsoring this video.

193
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,600
The Great Courses Plus is a subscription video on-demand learning service where you can watch

194
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,240
top-notch lectures from experts from Ivy League universities, National Geographic, the Smithsonian,

195
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,720
the Culinary Institute of America, and more well-known institutions.

196
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,680
They have a library of over 7,000 lectures about pretty much anything and everything.

197
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,080
You can learn how to cook, how to play chess, become a better photographer—pretty much

198
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,800
anything you want to learn, they have a lecture on it.

199
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,900
I personally really enjoyed a course by National Geographic called National Geographic Polar

200
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:12,000
Explorations which teaches all about the science, history, and culture of the polar regions.

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
If you want to learn about this or any of the hundreds of other topics they have, you

202
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,880
can do so for free for a month by signing up at thegreatcoursesplus.com slash wendover.

203
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,320
A clickable link is also in the description.

204
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,620
After that completely free first month, plans start at $14.99 per month.

205
