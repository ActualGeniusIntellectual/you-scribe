1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
A fraction of a second ago, the electricity powering your lights, your air conditioning,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,400
your television, your refrigerator—nearly everything electric around you right now was

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,400
water, gas, wind, or some other form of energy, potentially hundreds or thousands of miles

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,680
away.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,260
If you flip a light switch in Los Angeles, that could cause a turbine in Washington to

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,040
start spinning.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,400
Electric grids are considered some of the single largest machines in existence—they

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,240
stretch across entire continents, but they're machines with absolutely zero slack.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,380
With water systems, for example, there's some extra supply in a storage reservoir at

10
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:42,120
the treatment plant, and some extra supply in the pipes connecting the treatment plant

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,840
to your home—supply only has to roughly match demand, but that's not the case with

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
electricity.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,720
Your lights, your TV, your microwave—everything plugged into the grid uses electricity produced

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,120
just moments ago.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,120
For the sake of example, let's look at what it takes to turn on the lights at the public

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,120
library in the small town of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,240
Now, what makes the relatively straightforward task of converting natural fuels or phenomena

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,520
into electric power difficult is the huge variability in demand from minute to minute

19
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,160
and month to month.

20
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,720
There are, however, some trends.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,620
On an annual basis, the peaks correlate to climate—January represents the winter high

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,120
water mark as many homes and businesses turn on their electric heating, while July typically

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,580
ranks highest outright as the country battles summer heat with air conditioners.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,400
The month-to-month variations are not that significant, though.

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,140
The difference between the highest and lowest demand months is less than a third.

26
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,220
Most of the variability happens across a given day.

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:48,340
In January, all regions of the US observe a two-peak daily demand trend, where electricity

28
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,140
use spikes around 7 AM as people turn up their thermostats and fire up lights and appliances

29
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,540
as they wake up and get ready for the day.

30
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:00,140
Then, demand peaks again when people return from work in the evening and do the same.

31
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,860
Meanwhile, in July, energy use is highest in the late afternoon or early evening, but

32
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,060
this does depend on the region.

33
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,020
For example, in the sweltering southwest, usage peaks around 4 PM—around the hottest

34
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,820
hour of the afternoon, when air conditioners have to work the hardest.

35
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,400
In the more temperate northwest, though, which includes Colorado and that Glenwood

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,900
Springs Public Library, fewer buildings have air conditioning, so demand peaks around 6

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,060
PM—pulled back by post-work use of appliances, lights, televisions, and more.

38
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,680
These trends then get further complicated by holidays and special events—for example,

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,660
on Super Bowl Sunday in the US, demand plummets for a few hours as people turn off the lights,

40
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,700
stop cooking, and gather together at others' homes to watch the big game.

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,980
This is all to say, when forecasting demand, utilities need to factor in the hour, day,

42
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,900
season, location, and plenty more.

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,540
Now, with whatever demand materializes, utilities then need to essentially instantly match supply.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,740
To do this, they layer different energy sources on top of each other.

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,220
Often, the lowest layer is nuclear power.

46
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,820
Nuclear power stations aren't designed to be able to turn off and on easily—it would

47
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,140
take the better part of a day to shut down and start up again—so it's rather impractical

48
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,940
to operate these in response to demand.

49
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,800
In addition, considering how massively expensive their construction is, it would be economically

50
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,340
inefficient to let these stations run idle.

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,600
Therefore, they'll run nearly continuously for the entirety of their service lives, except

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,480
for during planned maintenance.

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,940
This means they provide the most stable supply of electricity 24-7.

54
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:42,260
Colorado no longer operates any nuclear power plants, but it does have six of the next layer—coal

55
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,500
power stations.

56
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,820
Like nuclear, most of these coal plants cannot be fired up quickly, as they take some time

57
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,420
to get up to temperature, so utilities will also run them essentially continuously.

58
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,740
Coal and nuclear combined typically fulfill what's called the baseload.

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:01,580
Their continuous production essentially equals the valley of demand—they'll make the

60
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,920
minimum amount of power needed at a point in the day.

61
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,580
So then, on top of that, utilities need production methods that can fire up and shut down far

62
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,340
faster—they need to be able to produce the power to operate all those AC units in hot

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,060
summer afternoons.

64
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,300
The bulk of this job is completed by natural gas-fired plants.

65
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:27,980
Of the 25 in Colorado, 13 of these stations generate using a simple cycle combustion turbine.

66
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:33,260
This is the simplest means of turning natural gas into electricity—much like a jet engine,

67
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,000
the fuel is used to turn a turbine, which turns a generator, which produces electricity.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,660
More advanced natural gas power plants recover the hot exhaust to convert it into electricity

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:47,120
too, but the startup process for these takes longer, so simple cycle stations are used

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,120
for applications where speed is key.

71
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,260
Most can reach full power within 15 minutes, making them an effective tool to respond to

72
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,340
those short peaks in demand.

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,220
Nuclear, coal, and natural gas are some of the more traditional means of generating electricity.

74
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,220
The recent proliferation of renewable energy sources, though, has kickstarted a reinvention

75
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,220
of this system of baseload and peaker plants.

76
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,700
That's because, when wind and solar generating stations can make power, that power is essentially

77
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:21,420
free—meaning, there's essentially no additional, variable cost to generate power once the panels

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,980
or turbines are installed.

79
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:28,160
That's not the case with natural gas-fired plants, for example, as the gas itself represents

80
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,020
one of their primary costs.

81
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,800
So, this essentially creates a new bottom layer to the energy mix, but it's a bottom

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,120
layer that's uncontrollably variable.

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:42,420
One sunny, windy day could mean that a state has an excess of electricity when added to

84
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,900
its baseload sources, while one cloudy, windless day could mean that the peaker plants have

85
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,140
to operate at full force.

86
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,620
Nuclear and onshore wind power are now some of the cheapest sources of electricity, but

87
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,180
because they rely on natural phenomena, they can't match supply to demand the way that

88
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,860
the traditional nuclear, coal, natural gas trifecta can.

89
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,940
Therefore, grids are being reinvented so that supply doesn't have to match demand—at

90
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,960
least minute to minute.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,580
Of course, the way to do that is with storage, but storing electricity is not easy.

92
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,760
The average American household uses about 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,960
Lithium-ion batteries currently cost around $130 per kilowatt-hour, meaning one day storage

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,980
for one household would cost around $3,900 in batteries—and that's excluding all

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,060
the additional infrastructure needed to make such an installation possible.

96
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,420
Considering the average American household pays less than half of that per year in electricity

97
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:42,780
bills, installing such a system grid-wide would be economically impractical.

98
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,420
Nonetheless, Colorado has four battery electric storage systems—albeit at a relatively

99
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,620
minor scale.

100
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,040
The largest of which is used to power Fort Carson, a US Army base near Colorado Springs.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,660
They charge up the 8.5 megawatt battery at night, when electricity demand and therefore

102
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,220
rates are low, then use the power during the day when the majority of the base's electricity

103
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,620
use occurs.

104
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,540
The system's savings should make up for its installation costs in about 13 years,

105
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,480
then by the end of its practical lifespan, it's expected to have saved the Army about

106
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,960
half a million dollars in electricity costs.

107
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,180
While such a system can make economic sense for large complexes that can invest in infrastructure

108
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,680
that won't pay off for more than a decade, it's just not practical grid-wide, at least

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,780
right now.

110
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,980
Even if there was the battery production capacity to make a meaningful dent in the world's

111
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,300
electricity use, the savings just happen too far in the future for most to consider such

112
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,140
storage to be worth it.

113
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,840
However, for entirely different reasons, in the coming decades, more and more people will

114
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,960
be purchasing massive battery packs—the ones inside their EVs.

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,180
With most forecasts suggesting that some third of new car sales in the US will be electric

116
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,460
by 2030, a potential solution to the grid storage need could arise naturally.

117
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:03,580
A Rivian R1T, for example, holds a 135 kilowatt-hour battery pack, meaning it could, theoretically,

118
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,340
power the average American household for four and a half days.

119
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:12,420
While EVs typically take in electricity, little stands in the way technologically from them

120
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,820
giving that electricity back to the grid.

121
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,500
So, the idea is that EVs could charge at night or when renewables are performing well, then

122
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,220
supply some of that electricity back to the grid during the day while parked and plugged

123
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,220
in.

124
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:28,620
In exchange, vehicle owners would be compensated a small amount by the utility company.

125
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,900
While the real-world, wide-scale economics have yet to be proven, especially in the face

126
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,620
of battery degradation, this vehicle-to-grid concept could potentially play a cooperative

127
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,420
role in the transition towards a greener grid.

128
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:44,980
Now, the largest current battery electric storage system in Colorado, the Fort Carson

129
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,740
installation, has 8.5 megawatts of capacity.

130
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,280
Elsewhere in the state, however, there is a massive, different form of battery that

131
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,340
can power over 10,000 homes at once.

132
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,080
And it looks like this.

133
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,400
Power is one of the earliest forms of energy that humans harnessed, and it still represents

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,180
one of the best sources of electricity.

135
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,200
Hydroelectric power is the best of both worlds.

136
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,580
While there's certainly the potential for environmental damage from damming up rivers,

137
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,400
the carbon impact is near zero, meaning hydro is green like wind and solar.

138
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,880
However, it's also reliable.

139
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,440
In theory, hydroelectric dams can start and stop making power in minutes, even if in practice

140
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,260
a minimum flow is typically maintained, so they can operate like those natural gas single-cycle

141
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,080
peaker plants responding to demand.

142
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,280
Of course, there's only so much water upstream, especially in a place like Colorado, which

143
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,280
is in the midst of a 20-year long drought, but hydroelectric dams simply convert potential

144
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,320
energy into electric energy—there's no reason why that process can't happen in

145
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
reverse.

146
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,880
That's what happens here, at the Cabin Creek Generating Station.

147
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,380
When electricity's cheap, typically at night, or when wind and solar are performing

148
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,600
at their peak, the facility uses it to pump water to its upper, higher elevation reservoir.

149
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,240
Then, when electricity's expensive and in demand, like in the late afternoon, it will

150
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,280
start flowing that water through its turbines, out into its lower reservoir.

151
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,520
It's essentially a form of price arbitrage, but it's one that's already helping smooth

152
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,240
out the peaks and valleys of wind and solar power production.

153
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,600
Now, no matter how well supply is matched to demand, electricity is of no use to that

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,640
Glenwood Springs, Colorado library until, of course, it gets there.

155
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
Many have an image of power plants as something sitting just outside every town and city—while

156
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
that's how the earliest grids operated, it's hardly the case anymore.

157
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,940
Despite dramatic declines in the past decade, some 42% of Colorado's power supply still

158
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,640
comes from coal.

159
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,960
That means that nearly half of the state's electricity originates from, essentially,

160
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,680
just six sites—the state's coal power stations.

161
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,280
Therefore, the ability to effectively transport electricity over a long distance is essential.

162
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:06,340
Now, what makes long-distance transmission tricky is simple—the further you send electricity,

163
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,920
the more you lose along the way, typically through unavoidable conversion to heat.

164
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,700
Meanwhile, the more centralized your electricity production, the less it costs—it's simple

165
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,460
economies of scale.

166
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,220
Therefore, the task of transmission is all about balancing these competing effects to

167
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,020
find an equilibrium.

168
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:29,500
Now, houses, businesses, and other buildings connected to the grid all use alternating

169
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,020
current power.

170
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,540
A big reason why this standard beat out its direct current competitor in the days of Tesla,

171
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,100
Westinghouse, and Edison is because it's relatively easy to convert AC power between

172
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,220
higher and lower voltages using transformers.

173
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,620
What makes this crucial is that the higher the voltage, the less electricity lost during

174
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,620
transmission.

175
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,600
Specifically, a doubling in voltage quarters the power loss in transmission.

176
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,180
That relatively simple voltage transformation allows for a more efficient electricity distribution

177
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,180
system.

178
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,900
Colorado's second largest power plant is this—the Craig Generating Station.

179
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,080
It connects to some of the state's highest voltage transmission lines, two of which head

180
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,760
due south until the town of Rifle.

181
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,640
Now, these lines operate at 345 kilovolts, which means that, in theory, over the 75-mile

182
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,240
or 120-kilometer stretch from Craig to Rifle, about 3.2% of the electricity is lost—a

183
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,960
relatively minor amount thanks to the efficiency of high-voltage transmission.

184
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,400
Other more densely populated regions, which need more electric transmission capacity,

185
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,000
have even higher voltage lines, all the way up to 765 kilovolts.

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,380
The current highest voltage transmission standard in the US.

187
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,240
Quite few of these lines exist in the US—there's one connecting Quebec to New York State, and

188
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,560
then a larger system spanning between Illinois and Virginia.

189
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,240
These can carry about six times as much electricity as the 345 kilovolt line between Craig and

190
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:06,560
Rifle and, thanks to their high voltage, see as little as 0.6% loss per 100 miles or 160

191
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
kilometers.

192
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,800
This means that, in theory, assuming the infrastructure existed, a 765 kilovolt line

193
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,060
could transmit electricity from New York to LA, and about 87% of it would still be there

194
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
at the other end.

195
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,300
That's why these high-voltage lines are becoming more and more common.

196
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,680
But what's even more efficient than transmitting an alternating current at a super-high voltage

197
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,960
is transmitting a direct current.

198
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,740
Of course, the difficulty with direct current is that transforming it between voltages is

199
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,980
more expensive than with AC, and for use in today's grid, it has to be converted

200
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,500
to AC power, which is also expensive.

201
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,060
However, compared to the absolute lowest 0.6% loss per 100 miles with the highest voltage

202
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,420
AC lines, DC lines see as little as 0.45% loss per 100 miles.

203
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,520
Therefore, when there's a need to transmit a huge amount of electricity over a long distance,

204
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,180
the economics can work in favor of converting power to DC at its origin, and converting

205
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,060
it back to AC at its destination.

206
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,620
Perhaps the most prominent application of such a system in the US is the Pacific-DC

207
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,920
Intertie, stretching between Northern Oregon and Los Angeles, California.

208
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,260
In the summer, the temperate Northwest has relatively little power demand, but generates

209
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,540
a huge amount of cheap electricity thanks to a tighter electric dance.

210
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:29,420
So, the Pacific-DC Intertie sends this electricity south to power Los Angeles' air conditioners

211
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,420
during its hot summer.

212
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,620
Meanwhile, in the winter, Los Angeles sees temperate weather and little need for climate

213
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,500
control, so it sends its excess electricity north to the Pacific Northwest to power its

214
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,900
electric heating.

215
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:46,460
Phenomena like this demonstrate why creating a greener, more efficient grid involves a

216
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,180
proliferation of long-distance power transmission infrastructure—it's needed to balance

217
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:55,420
out seasonal trends, and to bring power from where it can be produced easily to where it

218
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,020
cannot.

219
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:02,540
Back in Colorado, though, its relatively minor 345 kilovolt line from the Craig Power Station

220
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,940
eventually enters this more populated area flinking Interstate 70.

221
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,780
Here, there are a number of nearby towns that need electricity, but sending 345 kilovolts

222
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,500
to each of these would not be efficient.

223
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,300
That's simply because the higher the voltage, the higher the construction cost.

224
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:28,420
A 345 kilovolt substation might cost $10.7 million, while a 235 kilovolt one just $7.6.

225
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:35,580
Meanwhile, a 345 kilovolt line costs around $4.5 million per mile to build, while a 230

226
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,100
kilovolt line just $2.8 million.

227
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,460
Therefore, even though the transmission losses will be greater, a number of substations around

228
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:47,680
rifle transform the electricity to 230 kilovolts, and then smaller, cheaper lines carry the

229
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,080
flow west, south, and east, closer to its final customers.

230
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:57,120
About 30 miles or 50 kilometers to the east, this line encounters another substation, which

231
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,040
steps it down to just 69 kilovolts, and then another yet smaller line circles back towards

232
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,440
Glenwood Springs.

233
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,460
The power is then stepped down again to 12.47 kilovolts, before a final transformer converts

234
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:15,360
it to 120, 240, or 480 volts—the voltage is used by almost all buildings in the US,

235
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,220
including the public library of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

236
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,360
Unlike with electricity, the supply of domain names is stable—there's only one went

237
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,160
over productions.com, for example—even as demand grows and grows.

238
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,480
