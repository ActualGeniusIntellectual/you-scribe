0	5160	A fraction of a second ago, the electricity powering your lights, your air conditioning,
5160	10400	your television, your refrigerator—nearly everything electric around you right now was
10400	16400	water, gas, wind, or some other form of energy, potentially hundreds or thousands of miles
16400	17680	away.
17680	22260	If you flip a light switch in Los Angeles, that could cause a turbine in Washington to
22260	24040	start spinning.
24040	28400	Electric grids are considered some of the single largest machines in existence—they
28400	34240	stretch across entire continents, but they're machines with absolutely zero slack.
34240	38380	With water systems, for example, there's some extra supply in a storage reservoir at
38380	42120	the treatment plant, and some extra supply in the pipes connecting the treatment plant
42120	46840	to your home—supply only has to roughly match demand, but that's not the case with
46840	47840	electricity.
47840	53720	Your lights, your TV, your microwave—everything plugged into the grid uses electricity produced
53720	55120	just moments ago.
55640	59120	For the sake of example, let's look at what it takes to turn on the lights at the public
59120	63120	library in the small town of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.
63120	68240	Now, what makes the relatively straightforward task of converting natural fuels or phenomena
68240	73520	into electric power difficult is the huge variability in demand from minute to minute
73520	75160	and month to month.
75160	77720	There are, however, some trends.
77720	82620	On an annual basis, the peaks correlate to climate—January represents the winter high
82620	87120	water mark as many homes and businesses turn on their electric heating, while July typically
87120	91580	ranks highest outright as the country battles summer heat with air conditioners.
91580	95400	The month-to-month variations are not that significant, though.
95400	100140	The difference between the highest and lowest demand months is less than a third.
100140	103220	Most of the variability happens across a given day.
103220	108340	In January, all regions of the US observe a two-peak daily demand trend, where electricity
108340	113140	use spikes around 7 AM as people turn up their thermostats and fire up lights and appliances
113140	115540	as they wake up and get ready for the day.
115540	120140	Then, demand peaks again when people return from work in the evening and do the same.
120140	124860	Meanwhile, in July, energy use is highest in the late afternoon or early evening, but
124860	127060	this does depend on the region.
127060	132020	For example, in the sweltering southwest, usage peaks around 4 PM—around the hottest
132020	135820	hour of the afternoon, when air conditioners have to work the hardest.
135820	139400	In the more temperate northwest, though, which includes Colorado and that Glenwood
139400	143900	Springs Public Library, fewer buildings have air conditioning, so demand peaks around 6
143900	149060	PM—pulled back by post-work use of appliances, lights, televisions, and more.
149060	153680	These trends then get further complicated by holidays and special events—for example,
153680	158660	on Super Bowl Sunday in the US, demand plummets for a few hours as people turn off the lights,
158660	162700	stop cooking, and gather together at others' homes to watch the big game.
162700	167980	This is all to say, when forecasting demand, utilities need to factor in the hour, day,
167980	170900	season, location, and plenty more.
170900	177540	Now, with whatever demand materializes, utilities then need to essentially instantly match supply.
177540	181740	To do this, they layer different energy sources on top of each other.
181740	185220	Often, the lowest layer is nuclear power.
185220	189820	Nuclear power stations aren't designed to be able to turn off and on easily—it would
189820	194140	take the better part of a day to shut down and start up again—so it's rather impractical
194140	196940	to operate these in response to demand.
196940	201800	In addition, considering how massively expensive their construction is, it would be economically
201800	204340	inefficient to let these stations run idle.
204340	209600	Therefore, they'll run nearly continuously for the entirety of their service lives, except
209600	211480	for during planned maintenance.
211480	215940	This means they provide the most stable supply of electricity 24-7.
215940	222260	Colorado no longer operates any nuclear power plants, but it does have six of the next layer—coal
222260	223500	power stations.
223500	227820	Like nuclear, most of these coal plants cannot be fired up quickly, as they take some time
227820	232420	to get up to temperature, so utilities will also run them essentially continuously.
232420	236740	Coal and nuclear combined typically fulfill what's called the baseload.
236740	241580	Their continuous production essentially equals the valley of demand—they'll make the
241580	244920	minimum amount of power needed at a point in the day.
244920	250580	So then, on top of that, utilities need production methods that can fire up and shut down far
250580	255340	faster—they need to be able to produce the power to operate all those AC units in hot
255340	257060	summer afternoons.
257060	261300	The bulk of this job is completed by natural gas-fired plants.
261300	267980	Of the 25 in Colorado, 13 of these stations generate using a simple cycle combustion turbine.
267980	273260	This is the simplest means of turning natural gas into electricity—much like a jet engine,
273260	278000	the fuel is used to turn a turbine, which turns a generator, which produces electricity.
278000	282660	More advanced natural gas power plants recover the hot exhaust to convert it into electricity
282660	287120	too, but the startup process for these takes longer, so simple cycle stations are used
287120	290120	for applications where speed is key.
290120	294260	Most can reach full power within 15 minutes, making them an effective tool to respond to
294260	296340	those short peaks in demand.
296340	302220	Nuclear, coal, and natural gas are some of the more traditional means of generating electricity.
302220	307220	The recent proliferation of renewable energy sources, though, has kickstarted a reinvention
307220	310220	of this system of baseload and peaker plants.
310220	315700	That's because, when wind and solar generating stations can make power, that power is essentially
315700	321420	free—meaning, there's essentially no additional, variable cost to generate power once the panels
321420	322980	or turbines are installed.
322980	328160	That's not the case with natural gas-fired plants, for example, as the gas itself represents
328160	330020	one of their primary costs.
330020	334800	So, this essentially creates a new bottom layer to the energy mix, but it's a bottom
334800	338120	layer that's uncontrollably variable.
338120	342420	One sunny, windy day could mean that a state has an excess of electricity when added to
342420	346900	its baseload sources, while one cloudy, windless day could mean that the peaker plants have
346900	349140	to operate at full force.
349140	353620	Nuclear and onshore wind power are now some of the cheapest sources of electricity, but
353620	358180	because they rely on natural phenomena, they can't match supply to demand the way that
358180	361860	the traditional nuclear, coal, natural gas trifecta can.
361860	366940	Therefore, grids are being reinvented so that supply doesn't have to match demand—at
366940	368960	least minute to minute.
368960	374580	Of course, the way to do that is with storage, but storing electricity is not easy.
374580	379760	The average American household uses about 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.
379760	384960	Lithium-ion batteries currently cost around $130 per kilowatt-hour, meaning one day storage
384960	389980	for one household would cost around $3,900 in batteries—and that's excluding all
389980	394060	the additional infrastructure needed to make such an installation possible.
394060	398420	Considering the average American household pays less than half of that per year in electricity
398420	402780	bills, installing such a system grid-wide would be economically impractical.
402780	408420	Nonetheless, Colorado has four battery electric storage systems—albeit at a relatively
408420	409620	minor scale.
409620	415040	The largest of which is used to power Fort Carson, a US Army base near Colorado Springs.
415040	419660	They charge up the 8.5 megawatt battery at night, when electricity demand and therefore
419660	424220	rates are low, then use the power during the day when the majority of the base's electricity
424220	425620	use occurs.
425620	429540	The system's savings should make up for its installation costs in about 13 years,
429540	433480	then by the end of its practical lifespan, it's expected to have saved the Army about
433480	436960	half a million dollars in electricity costs.
436960	441180	While such a system can make economic sense for large complexes that can invest in infrastructure
441180	445680	that won't pay off for more than a decade, it's just not practical grid-wide, at least
445680	446780	right now.
446780	450980	Even if there was the battery production capacity to make a meaningful dent in the world's
450980	455300	electricity use, the savings just happen too far in the future for most to consider such
455300	457140	storage to be worth it.
457140	461840	However, for entirely different reasons, in the coming decades, more and more people will
461840	466960	be purchasing massive battery packs—the ones inside their EVs.
466960	471180	With most forecasts suggesting that some third of new car sales in the US will be electric
471180	476460	by 2030, a potential solution to the grid storage need could arise naturally.
476460	483580	A Rivian R1T, for example, holds a 135 kilowatt-hour battery pack, meaning it could, theoretically,
483580	487340	power the average American household for four and a half days.
487340	492420	While EVs typically take in electricity, little stands in the way technologically from them
492420	494820	giving that electricity back to the grid.
494820	499500	So, the idea is that EVs could charge at night or when renewables are performing well, then
499500	503220	supply some of that electricity back to the grid during the day while parked and plugged
503220	504220	in.
504220	508620	In exchange, vehicle owners would be compensated a small amount by the utility company.
508620	512900	While the real-world, wide-scale economics have yet to be proven, especially in the face
512900	517620	of battery degradation, this vehicle-to-grid concept could potentially play a cooperative
517620	520420	role in the transition towards a greener grid.
520420	524980	Now, the largest current battery electric storage system in Colorado, the Fort Carson
524980	528740	installation, has 8.5 megawatts of capacity.
528740	533280	Elsewhere in the state, however, there is a massive, different form of battery that
533280	537340	can power over 10,000 homes at once.
537340	540080	And it looks like this.
540080	544400	Power is one of the earliest forms of energy that humans harnessed, and it still represents
544400	548180	one of the best sources of electricity.
548180	550200	Hydroelectric power is the best of both worlds.
550200	554580	While there's certainly the potential for environmental damage from damming up rivers,
554580	559400	the carbon impact is near zero, meaning hydro is green like wind and solar.
559400	561880	However, it's also reliable.
561880	567440	In theory, hydroelectric dams can start and stop making power in minutes, even if in practice
567440	572260	a minimum flow is typically maintained, so they can operate like those natural gas single-cycle
572260	575080	peaker plants responding to demand.
575080	579280	Of course, there's only so much water upstream, especially in a place like Colorado, which
579280	584280	is in the midst of a 20-year long drought, but hydroelectric dams simply convert potential
584280	589320	energy into electric energy—there's no reason why that process can't happen in
589320	590320	reverse.
590320	594880	That's what happens here, at the Cabin Creek Generating Station.
594880	598380	When electricity's cheap, typically at night, or when wind and solar are performing
598380	603600	at their peak, the facility uses it to pump water to its upper, higher elevation reservoir.
603600	608240	Then, when electricity's expensive and in demand, like in the late afternoon, it will
608240	612280	start flowing that water through its turbines, out into its lower reservoir.
612280	616520	It's essentially a form of price arbitrage, but it's one that's already helping smooth
616520	620240	out the peaks and valleys of wind and solar power production.
620240	625600	Now, no matter how well supply is matched to demand, electricity is of no use to that
625600	630640	Glenwood Springs, Colorado library until, of course, it gets there.
630640	635200	Many have an image of power plants as something sitting just outside every town and city—while
635200	639600	that's how the earliest grids operated, it's hardly the case anymore.
639600	644940	Despite dramatic declines in the past decade, some 42% of Colorado's power supply still
644940	646640	comes from coal.
646640	650960	That means that nearly half of the state's electricity originates from, essentially,
650960	654680	just six sites—the state's coal power stations.
654680	660280	Therefore, the ability to effectively transport electricity over a long distance is essential.
660280	666340	Now, what makes long-distance transmission tricky is simple—the further you send electricity,
666340	670920	the more you lose along the way, typically through unavoidable conversion to heat.
670920	675700	Meanwhile, the more centralized your electricity production, the less it costs—it's simple
675740	677460	economies of scale.
677460	682220	Therefore, the task of transmission is all about balancing these competing effects to
682220	684020	find an equilibrium.
684020	689500	Now, houses, businesses, and other buildings connected to the grid all use alternating
689500	691020	current power.
691020	695540	A big reason why this standard beat out its direct current competitor in the days of Tesla,
695540	700100	Westinghouse, and Edison is because it's relatively easy to convert AC power between
700100	703220	higher and lower voltages using transformers.
703260	708620	What makes this crucial is that the higher the voltage, the less electricity lost during
708620	709620	transmission.
709620	714600	Specifically, a doubling in voltage quarters the power loss in transmission.
714600	720180	That relatively simple voltage transformation allows for a more efficient electricity distribution
720180	721180	system.
721180	726900	Colorado's second largest power plant is this—the Craig Generating Station.
726900	731080	It connects to some of the state's highest voltage transmission lines, two of which head
731080	733760	due south until the town of Rifle.
733760	740640	Now, these lines operate at 345 kilovolts, which means that, in theory, over the 75-mile
740640	747240	or 120-kilometer stretch from Craig to Rifle, about 3.2% of the electricity is lost—a
747240	751960	relatively minor amount thanks to the efficiency of high-voltage transmission.
751960	756400	Other more densely populated regions, which need more electric transmission capacity,
756400	761000	have even higher voltage lines, all the way up to 765 kilovolts.
761000	764380	The current highest voltage transmission standard in the US.
764380	769240	Quite few of these lines exist in the US—there's one connecting Quebec to New York State, and
769240	772560	then a larger system spanning between Illinois and Virginia.
772560	778240	These can carry about six times as much electricity as the 345 kilovolt line between Craig and
778240	786560	Rifle and, thanks to their high voltage, see as little as 0.6% loss per 100 miles or 160
786560	787560	kilometers.
787560	792800	This means that, in theory, assuming the infrastructure existed, a 765 kilovolt line
792800	798060	could transmit electricity from New York to LA, and about 87% of it would still be there
798060	799060	at the other end.
799060	804300	That's why these high-voltage lines are becoming more and more common.
804300	808680	But what's even more efficient than transmitting an alternating current at a super-high voltage
808680	810960	is transmitting a direct current.
810960	814740	Of course, the difficulty with direct current is that transforming it between voltages is
814740	818980	more expensive than with AC, and for use in today's grid, it has to be converted
818980	821500	to AC power, which is also expensive.
821500	827060	However, compared to the absolute lowest 0.6% loss per 100 miles with the highest voltage
827060	833420	AC lines, DC lines see as little as 0.45% loss per 100 miles.
833420	838520	Therefore, when there's a need to transmit a huge amount of electricity over a long distance,
838520	843180	the economics can work in favor of converting power to DC at its origin, and converting
843180	846060	it back to AC at its destination.
846060	850620	Perhaps the most prominent application of such a system in the US is the Pacific-DC
850620	854920	Intertie, stretching between Northern Oregon and Los Angeles, California.
854920	859260	In the summer, the temperate Northwest has relatively little power demand, but generates
859260	863540	a huge amount of cheap electricity thanks to a tighter electric dance.
863540	869420	So, the Pacific-DC Intertie sends this electricity south to power Los Angeles' air conditioners
869420	871420	during its hot summer.
871460	875620	Meanwhile, in the winter, Los Angeles sees temperate weather and little need for climate
875620	880500	control, so it sends its excess electricity north to the Pacific Northwest to power its
880500	881900	electric heating.
881900	886460	Phenomena like this demonstrate why creating a greener, more efficient grid involves a
886460	891180	proliferation of long-distance power transmission infrastructure—it's needed to balance
891180	895420	out seasonal trends, and to bring power from where it can be produced easily to where it
895420	897020	cannot.
897020	902540	Back in Colorado, though, its relatively minor 345 kilovolt line from the Craig Power Station
902540	906940	eventually enters this more populated area flinking Interstate 70.
906940	912780	Here, there are a number of nearby towns that need electricity, but sending 345 kilovolts
912780	915500	to each of these would not be efficient.
915500	920300	That's simply because the higher the voltage, the higher the construction cost.
920300	928420	A 345 kilovolt substation might cost $10.7 million, while a 235 kilovolt one just $7.6.
928420	935580	Meanwhile, a 345 kilovolt line costs around $4.5 million per mile to build, while a 230
935580	938100	kilovolt line just $2.8 million.
938100	942460	Therefore, even though the transmission losses will be greater, a number of substations around
942460	947680	rifle transform the electricity to 230 kilovolts, and then smaller, cheaper lines carry the
947680	952080	flow west, south, and east, closer to its final customers.
952080	957120	About 30 miles or 50 kilometers to the east, this line encounters another substation, which
957120	962040	steps it down to just 69 kilovolts, and then another yet smaller line circles back towards
962040	963440	Glenwood Springs.
963440	968460	The power is then stepped down again to 12.47 kilovolts, before a final transformer converts
968460	975360	it to 120, 240, or 480 volts—the voltage is used by almost all buildings in the US,
975360	980220	including the public library of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.
