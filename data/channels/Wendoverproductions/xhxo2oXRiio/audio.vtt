00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
A fraction of a second ago, the electricity powering your lights, your air conditioning,

00:05.160 --> 00:10.400
your television, your refrigerator—nearly everything electric around you right now was

00:10.400 --> 00:16.400
water, gas, wind, or some other form of energy, potentially hundreds or thousands of miles

00:16.400 --> 00:17.680
away.

00:17.680 --> 00:22.260
If you flip a light switch in Los Angeles, that could cause a turbine in Washington to

00:22.260 --> 00:24.040
start spinning.

00:24.040 --> 00:28.400
Electric grids are considered some of the single largest machines in existence—they

00:28.400 --> 00:34.240
stretch across entire continents, but they're machines with absolutely zero slack.

00:34.240 --> 00:38.380
With water systems, for example, there's some extra supply in a storage reservoir at

00:38.380 --> 00:42.120
the treatment plant, and some extra supply in the pipes connecting the treatment plant

00:42.120 --> 00:46.840
to your home—supply only has to roughly match demand, but that's not the case with

00:46.840 --> 00:47.840
electricity.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.720
Your lights, your TV, your microwave—everything plugged into the grid uses electricity produced

00:53.720 --> 00:55.120
just moments ago.

00:55.640 --> 00:59.120
For the sake of example, let's look at what it takes to turn on the lights at the public

00:59.120 --> 01:03.120
library in the small town of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

01:03.120 --> 01:08.240
Now, what makes the relatively straightforward task of converting natural fuels or phenomena

01:08.240 --> 01:13.520
into electric power difficult is the huge variability in demand from minute to minute

01:13.520 --> 01:15.160
and month to month.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.720
There are, however, some trends.

01:17.720 --> 01:22.620
On an annual basis, the peaks correlate to climate—January represents the winter high

01:22.620 --> 01:27.120
water mark as many homes and businesses turn on their electric heating, while July typically

01:27.120 --> 01:31.580
ranks highest outright as the country battles summer heat with air conditioners.

01:31.580 --> 01:35.400
The month-to-month variations are not that significant, though.

01:35.400 --> 01:40.140
The difference between the highest and lowest demand months is less than a third.

01:40.140 --> 01:43.220
Most of the variability happens across a given day.

01:43.220 --> 01:48.340
In January, all regions of the US observe a two-peak daily demand trend, where electricity

01:48.340 --> 01:53.140
use spikes around 7 AM as people turn up their thermostats and fire up lights and appliances

01:53.140 --> 01:55.540
as they wake up and get ready for the day.

01:55.540 --> 02:00.140
Then, demand peaks again when people return from work in the evening and do the same.

02:00.140 --> 02:04.860
Meanwhile, in July, energy use is highest in the late afternoon or early evening, but

02:04.860 --> 02:07.060
this does depend on the region.

02:07.060 --> 02:12.020
For example, in the sweltering southwest, usage peaks around 4 PM—around the hottest

02:12.020 --> 02:15.820
hour of the afternoon, when air conditioners have to work the hardest.

02:15.820 --> 02:19.400
In the more temperate northwest, though, which includes Colorado and that Glenwood

02:19.400 --> 02:23.900
Springs Public Library, fewer buildings have air conditioning, so demand peaks around 6

02:23.900 --> 02:29.060
PM—pulled back by post-work use of appliances, lights, televisions, and more.

02:29.060 --> 02:33.680
These trends then get further complicated by holidays and special events—for example,

02:33.680 --> 02:38.660
on Super Bowl Sunday in the US, demand plummets for a few hours as people turn off the lights,

02:38.660 --> 02:42.700
stop cooking, and gather together at others' homes to watch the big game.

02:42.700 --> 02:47.980
This is all to say, when forecasting demand, utilities need to factor in the hour, day,

02:47.980 --> 02:50.900
season, location, and plenty more.

02:50.900 --> 02:57.540
Now, with whatever demand materializes, utilities then need to essentially instantly match supply.

02:57.540 --> 03:01.740
To do this, they layer different energy sources on top of each other.

03:01.740 --> 03:05.220
Often, the lowest layer is nuclear power.

03:05.220 --> 03:09.820
Nuclear power stations aren't designed to be able to turn off and on easily—it would

03:09.820 --> 03:14.140
take the better part of a day to shut down and start up again—so it's rather impractical

03:14.140 --> 03:16.940
to operate these in response to demand.

03:16.940 --> 03:21.800
In addition, considering how massively expensive their construction is, it would be economically

03:21.800 --> 03:24.340
inefficient to let these stations run idle.

03:24.340 --> 03:29.600
Therefore, they'll run nearly continuously for the entirety of their service lives, except

03:29.600 --> 03:31.480
for during planned maintenance.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.940
This means they provide the most stable supply of electricity 24-7.

03:35.940 --> 03:42.260
Colorado no longer operates any nuclear power plants, but it does have six of the next layer—coal

03:42.260 --> 03:43.500
power stations.

03:43.500 --> 03:47.820
Like nuclear, most of these coal plants cannot be fired up quickly, as they take some time

03:47.820 --> 03:52.420
to get up to temperature, so utilities will also run them essentially continuously.

03:52.420 --> 03:56.740
Coal and nuclear combined typically fulfill what's called the baseload.

03:56.740 --> 04:01.580
Their continuous production essentially equals the valley of demand—they'll make the

04:01.580 --> 04:04.920
minimum amount of power needed at a point in the day.

04:04.920 --> 04:10.580
So then, on top of that, utilities need production methods that can fire up and shut down far

04:10.580 --> 04:15.340
faster—they need to be able to produce the power to operate all those AC units in hot

04:15.340 --> 04:17.060
summer afternoons.

04:17.060 --> 04:21.300
The bulk of this job is completed by natural gas-fired plants.

04:21.300 --> 04:27.980
Of the 25 in Colorado, 13 of these stations generate using a simple cycle combustion turbine.

04:27.980 --> 04:33.260
This is the simplest means of turning natural gas into electricity—much like a jet engine,

04:33.260 --> 04:38.000
the fuel is used to turn a turbine, which turns a generator, which produces electricity.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.660
More advanced natural gas power plants recover the hot exhaust to convert it into electricity

04:42.660 --> 04:47.120
too, but the startup process for these takes longer, so simple cycle stations are used

04:47.120 --> 04:50.120
for applications where speed is key.

04:50.120 --> 04:54.260
Most can reach full power within 15 minutes, making them an effective tool to respond to

04:54.260 --> 04:56.340
those short peaks in demand.

04:56.340 --> 05:02.220
Nuclear, coal, and natural gas are some of the more traditional means of generating electricity.

05:02.220 --> 05:07.220
The recent proliferation of renewable energy sources, though, has kickstarted a reinvention

05:07.220 --> 05:10.220
of this system of baseload and peaker plants.

05:10.220 --> 05:15.700
That's because, when wind and solar generating stations can make power, that power is essentially

05:15.700 --> 05:21.420
free—meaning, there's essentially no additional, variable cost to generate power once the panels

05:21.420 --> 05:22.980
or turbines are installed.

05:22.980 --> 05:28.160
That's not the case with natural gas-fired plants, for example, as the gas itself represents

05:28.160 --> 05:30.020
one of their primary costs.

05:30.020 --> 05:34.800
So, this essentially creates a new bottom layer to the energy mix, but it's a bottom

05:34.800 --> 05:38.120
layer that's uncontrollably variable.

05:38.120 --> 05:42.420
One sunny, windy day could mean that a state has an excess of electricity when added to

05:42.420 --> 05:46.900
its baseload sources, while one cloudy, windless day could mean that the peaker plants have

05:46.900 --> 05:49.140
to operate at full force.

05:49.140 --> 05:53.620
Nuclear and onshore wind power are now some of the cheapest sources of electricity, but

05:53.620 --> 05:58.180
because they rely on natural phenomena, they can't match supply to demand the way that

05:58.180 --> 06:01.860
the traditional nuclear, coal, natural gas trifecta can.

06:01.860 --> 06:06.940
Therefore, grids are being reinvented so that supply doesn't have to match demand—at

06:06.940 --> 06:08.960
least minute to minute.

06:08.960 --> 06:14.580
Of course, the way to do that is with storage, but storing electricity is not easy.

06:14.580 --> 06:19.760
The average American household uses about 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day.

06:19.760 --> 06:24.960
Lithium-ion batteries currently cost around $130 per kilowatt-hour, meaning one day storage

06:24.960 --> 06:29.980
for one household would cost around $3,900 in batteries—and that's excluding all

06:29.980 --> 06:34.060
the additional infrastructure needed to make such an installation possible.

06:34.060 --> 06:38.420
Considering the average American household pays less than half of that per year in electricity

06:38.420 --> 06:42.780
bills, installing such a system grid-wide would be economically impractical.

06:42.780 --> 06:48.420
Nonetheless, Colorado has four battery electric storage systems—albeit at a relatively

06:48.420 --> 06:49.620
minor scale.

06:49.620 --> 06:55.040
The largest of which is used to power Fort Carson, a US Army base near Colorado Springs.

06:55.040 --> 06:59.660
They charge up the 8.5 megawatt battery at night, when electricity demand and therefore

06:59.660 --> 07:04.220
rates are low, then use the power during the day when the majority of the base's electricity

07:04.220 --> 07:05.620
use occurs.

07:05.620 --> 07:09.540
The system's savings should make up for its installation costs in about 13 years,

07:09.540 --> 07:13.480
then by the end of its practical lifespan, it's expected to have saved the Army about

07:13.480 --> 07:16.960
half a million dollars in electricity costs.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.180
While such a system can make economic sense for large complexes that can invest in infrastructure

07:21.180 --> 07:25.680
that won't pay off for more than a decade, it's just not practical grid-wide, at least

07:25.680 --> 07:26.780
right now.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.980
Even if there was the battery production capacity to make a meaningful dent in the world's

07:30.980 --> 07:35.300
electricity use, the savings just happen too far in the future for most to consider such

07:35.300 --> 07:37.140
storage to be worth it.

07:37.140 --> 07:41.840
However, for entirely different reasons, in the coming decades, more and more people will

07:41.840 --> 07:46.960
be purchasing massive battery packs—the ones inside their EVs.

07:46.960 --> 07:51.180
With most forecasts suggesting that some third of new car sales in the US will be electric

07:51.180 --> 07:56.460
by 2030, a potential solution to the grid storage need could arise naturally.

07:56.460 --> 08:03.580
A Rivian R1T, for example, holds a 135 kilowatt-hour battery pack, meaning it could, theoretically,

08:03.580 --> 08:07.340
power the average American household for four and a half days.

08:07.340 --> 08:12.420
While EVs typically take in electricity, little stands in the way technologically from them

08:12.420 --> 08:14.820
giving that electricity back to the grid.

08:14.820 --> 08:19.500
So, the idea is that EVs could charge at night or when renewables are performing well, then

08:19.500 --> 08:23.220
supply some of that electricity back to the grid during the day while parked and plugged

08:23.220 --> 08:24.220
in.

08:24.220 --> 08:28.620
In exchange, vehicle owners would be compensated a small amount by the utility company.

08:28.620 --> 08:32.900
While the real-world, wide-scale economics have yet to be proven, especially in the face

08:32.900 --> 08:37.620
of battery degradation, this vehicle-to-grid concept could potentially play a cooperative

08:37.620 --> 08:40.420
role in the transition towards a greener grid.

08:40.420 --> 08:44.980
Now, the largest current battery electric storage system in Colorado, the Fort Carson

08:44.980 --> 08:48.740
installation, has 8.5 megawatts of capacity.

08:48.740 --> 08:53.280
Elsewhere in the state, however, there is a massive, different form of battery that

08:53.280 --> 08:57.340
can power over 10,000 homes at once.

08:57.340 --> 09:00.080
And it looks like this.

09:00.080 --> 09:04.400
Power is one of the earliest forms of energy that humans harnessed, and it still represents

09:04.400 --> 09:08.180
one of the best sources of electricity.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.200
Hydroelectric power is the best of both worlds.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.580
While there's certainly the potential for environmental damage from damming up rivers,

09:14.580 --> 09:19.400
the carbon impact is near zero, meaning hydro is green like wind and solar.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.880
However, it's also reliable.

09:21.880 --> 09:27.440
In theory, hydroelectric dams can start and stop making power in minutes, even if in practice

09:27.440 --> 09:32.260
a minimum flow is typically maintained, so they can operate like those natural gas single-cycle

09:32.260 --> 09:35.080
peaker plants responding to demand.

09:35.080 --> 09:39.280
Of course, there's only so much water upstream, especially in a place like Colorado, which

09:39.280 --> 09:44.280
is in the midst of a 20-year long drought, but hydroelectric dams simply convert potential

09:44.280 --> 09:49.320
energy into electric energy—there's no reason why that process can't happen in

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
reverse.

09:50.320 --> 09:54.880
That's what happens here, at the Cabin Creek Generating Station.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.380
When electricity's cheap, typically at night, or when wind and solar are performing

09:58.380 --> 10:03.600
at their peak, the facility uses it to pump water to its upper, higher elevation reservoir.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.240
Then, when electricity's expensive and in demand, like in the late afternoon, it will

10:08.240 --> 10:12.280
start flowing that water through its turbines, out into its lower reservoir.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.520
It's essentially a form of price arbitrage, but it's one that's already helping smooth

10:16.520 --> 10:20.240
out the peaks and valleys of wind and solar power production.

10:20.240 --> 10:25.600
Now, no matter how well supply is matched to demand, electricity is of no use to that

10:25.600 --> 10:30.640
Glenwood Springs, Colorado library until, of course, it gets there.

10:30.640 --> 10:35.200
Many have an image of power plants as something sitting just outside every town and city—while

10:35.200 --> 10:39.600
that's how the earliest grids operated, it's hardly the case anymore.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.940
Despite dramatic declines in the past decade, some 42% of Colorado's power supply still

10:44.940 --> 10:46.640
comes from coal.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.960
That means that nearly half of the state's electricity originates from, essentially,

10:50.960 --> 10:54.680
just six sites—the state's coal power stations.

10:54.680 --> 11:00.280
Therefore, the ability to effectively transport electricity over a long distance is essential.

11:00.280 --> 11:06.340
Now, what makes long-distance transmission tricky is simple—the further you send electricity,

11:06.340 --> 11:10.920
the more you lose along the way, typically through unavoidable conversion to heat.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.700
Meanwhile, the more centralized your electricity production, the less it costs—it's simple

11:15.740 --> 11:17.460
economies of scale.

11:17.460 --> 11:22.220
Therefore, the task of transmission is all about balancing these competing effects to

11:22.220 --> 11:24.020
find an equilibrium.

11:24.020 --> 11:29.500
Now, houses, businesses, and other buildings connected to the grid all use alternating

11:29.500 --> 11:31.020
current power.

11:31.020 --> 11:35.540
A big reason why this standard beat out its direct current competitor in the days of Tesla,

11:35.540 --> 11:40.100
Westinghouse, and Edison is because it's relatively easy to convert AC power between

11:40.100 --> 11:43.220
higher and lower voltages using transformers.

11:43.260 --> 11:48.620
What makes this crucial is that the higher the voltage, the less electricity lost during

11:48.620 --> 11:49.620
transmission.

11:49.620 --> 11:54.600
Specifically, a doubling in voltage quarters the power loss in transmission.

11:54.600 --> 12:00.180
That relatively simple voltage transformation allows for a more efficient electricity distribution

12:00.180 --> 12:01.180
system.

12:01.180 --> 12:06.900
Colorado's second largest power plant is this—the Craig Generating Station.

12:06.900 --> 12:11.080
It connects to some of the state's highest voltage transmission lines, two of which head

12:11.080 --> 12:13.760
due south until the town of Rifle.

12:13.760 --> 12:20.640
Now, these lines operate at 345 kilovolts, which means that, in theory, over the 75-mile

12:20.640 --> 12:27.240
or 120-kilometer stretch from Craig to Rifle, about 3.2% of the electricity is lost—a

12:27.240 --> 12:31.960
relatively minor amount thanks to the efficiency of high-voltage transmission.

12:31.960 --> 12:36.400
Other more densely populated regions, which need more electric transmission capacity,

12:36.400 --> 12:41.000
have even higher voltage lines, all the way up to 765 kilovolts.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.380
The current highest voltage transmission standard in the US.

12:44.380 --> 12:49.240
Quite few of these lines exist in the US—there's one connecting Quebec to New York State, and

12:49.240 --> 12:52.560
then a larger system spanning between Illinois and Virginia.

12:52.560 --> 12:58.240
These can carry about six times as much electricity as the 345 kilovolt line between Craig and

12:58.240 --> 13:06.560
Rifle and, thanks to their high voltage, see as little as 0.6% loss per 100 miles or 160

13:06.560 --> 13:07.560
kilometers.

13:07.560 --> 13:12.800
This means that, in theory, assuming the infrastructure existed, a 765 kilovolt line

13:12.800 --> 13:18.060
could transmit electricity from New York to LA, and about 87% of it would still be there

13:18.060 --> 13:19.060
at the other end.

13:19.060 --> 13:24.300
That's why these high-voltage lines are becoming more and more common.

13:24.300 --> 13:28.680
But what's even more efficient than transmitting an alternating current at a super-high voltage

13:28.680 --> 13:30.960
is transmitting a direct current.

13:30.960 --> 13:34.740
Of course, the difficulty with direct current is that transforming it between voltages is

13:34.740 --> 13:38.980
more expensive than with AC, and for use in today's grid, it has to be converted

13:38.980 --> 13:41.500
to AC power, which is also expensive.

13:41.500 --> 13:47.060
However, compared to the absolute lowest 0.6% loss per 100 miles with the highest voltage

13:47.060 --> 13:53.420
AC lines, DC lines see as little as 0.45% loss per 100 miles.

13:53.420 --> 13:58.520
Therefore, when there's a need to transmit a huge amount of electricity over a long distance,

13:58.520 --> 14:03.180
the economics can work in favor of converting power to DC at its origin, and converting

14:03.180 --> 14:06.060
it back to AC at its destination.

14:06.060 --> 14:10.620
Perhaps the most prominent application of such a system in the US is the Pacific-DC

14:10.620 --> 14:14.920
Intertie, stretching between Northern Oregon and Los Angeles, California.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.260
In the summer, the temperate Northwest has relatively little power demand, but generates

14:19.260 --> 14:23.540
a huge amount of cheap electricity thanks to a tighter electric dance.

14:23.540 --> 14:29.420
So, the Pacific-DC Intertie sends this electricity south to power Los Angeles' air conditioners

14:29.420 --> 14:31.420
during its hot summer.

14:31.460 --> 14:35.620
Meanwhile, in the winter, Los Angeles sees temperate weather and little need for climate

14:35.620 --> 14:40.500
control, so it sends its excess electricity north to the Pacific Northwest to power its

14:40.500 --> 14:41.900
electric heating.

14:41.900 --> 14:46.460
Phenomena like this demonstrate why creating a greener, more efficient grid involves a

14:46.460 --> 14:51.180
proliferation of long-distance power transmission infrastructure—it's needed to balance

14:51.180 --> 14:55.420
out seasonal trends, and to bring power from where it can be produced easily to where it

14:55.420 --> 14:57.020
cannot.

14:57.020 --> 15:02.540
Back in Colorado, though, its relatively minor 345 kilovolt line from the Craig Power Station

15:02.540 --> 15:06.940
eventually enters this more populated area flinking Interstate 70.

15:06.940 --> 15:12.780
Here, there are a number of nearby towns that need electricity, but sending 345 kilovolts

15:12.780 --> 15:15.500
to each of these would not be efficient.

15:15.500 --> 15:20.300
That's simply because the higher the voltage, the higher the construction cost.

15:20.300 --> 15:28.420
A 345 kilovolt substation might cost $10.7 million, while a 235 kilovolt one just $7.6.

15:28.420 --> 15:35.580
Meanwhile, a 345 kilovolt line costs around $4.5 million per mile to build, while a 230

15:35.580 --> 15:38.100
kilovolt line just $2.8 million.

15:38.100 --> 15:42.460
Therefore, even though the transmission losses will be greater, a number of substations around

15:42.460 --> 15:47.680
rifle transform the electricity to 230 kilovolts, and then smaller, cheaper lines carry the

15:47.680 --> 15:52.080
flow west, south, and east, closer to its final customers.

15:52.080 --> 15:57.120
About 30 miles or 50 kilometers to the east, this line encounters another substation, which

15:57.120 --> 16:02.040
steps it down to just 69 kilovolts, and then another yet smaller line circles back towards

16:02.040 --> 16:03.440
Glenwood Springs.

16:03.440 --> 16:08.460
The power is then stepped down again to 12.47 kilovolts, before a final transformer converts

16:08.460 --> 16:15.360
it to 120, 240, or 480 volts—the voltage is used by almost all buildings in the US,

16:15.360 --> 16:20.220
including the public library of Glenwood Springs, Colorado.

16:20.220 --> 16:24.360
Unlike with electricity, the supply of domain names is stable—there's only one went

16:24.360 --> 16:29.160
over productions.com, for example—even as demand grows and grows.

16:29.160 --> 16:33.480
There are now more websites on the internet than ever before—around 2 billion—so if

16:33.480 --> 16:37.760
there's even a chance you will want to make one in the future, now is the time to buy

16:37.760 --> 16:40.100
your domain before it's gone.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.680
Our sponsor, Hover, makes that incredibly easy.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.880
Whether you want the domain corresponding to your name, your business, your YouTube

16:46.880 --> 16:51.560
channel, or anything else, Hover makes finding it super simple, and you can even get extra

16:51.560 --> 16:57.240
creative and stand out with our over 400 domain extensions—like I did with our Wendover.Productions

16:57.240 --> 16:58.240
domain.

16:58.240 --> 17:02.920
Plus, with your new custom domain, Hover can set up a custom email address in seconds,

17:02.920 --> 17:07.800
meaning you can stand out with a firstname at lastname.com email address, for example.

17:07.800 --> 17:13.040
Hover also has super fair, transparent pricing, and truly awesome customer support, making

17:13.040 --> 17:16.280
them definitively the best place to go to get your domain.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.680
