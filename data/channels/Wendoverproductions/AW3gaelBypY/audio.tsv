0	6480	In the summer of 2018, western Pennsylvania birders, ornithologists, biologists, field-tripping
6480	12440	teachers, Appalachian Range romantics, and trail-loving hikers all had reason to celebrate.
12440	16580	The Nature Conservancy, one of the nation's largest environmental NGOs, had partnered
16580	21600	with the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary to preserve these 2,380 acres of wooded bird habitat some
21600	24960	80 miles or 130 kilometers outside of Philadelphia.
24960	29100	In the grand scheme of things, the move wasn't anything major.
29100	33640	By itself, a massive environmental organization preserving an area the size of a small ski
33640	35660	town didn't move the needle.
35660	39200	But the deal was bigger than local interests alone.
39200	41420	The benefits were global.
41420	45540	To fund the preserve's protection, the Nature Conservancy, partnered with BlueSource, began
45540	49900	selling carbon credits and, in an effort to offset emissions, JPMorgan Chase purchased
49900	51940	over 96,000 of them.
51940	57380	It wasn't just corporations buying in either—at just $15 a ton, individuals bought credits
57380	60100	to account for their summer vacations, too.
60100	65100	While small in scale, Hawk Mountain seemed a perfect project—a pragmatic effort that
65100	69460	saved important habitat and refuge for local birds and people, and provided means for the
69460	73200	environmentally conscious to address their own impact on the planet.
73200	77980	The only problem was, as one intrepid investigative journalist would expose, it was all built
77980	85420	on at best a massive oversimplification, and at worst, one big green lie.
85460	89500	At the simplest level, forest carbon offset projects work by comparing the amount of forest
89500	93740	preserved versus the assumed deforestation had it not been saved.
93740	98100	This means that calculating a hypothetical baseline really informs the entire project
98100	100340	and how many credits they can actually sell.
100340	105900	And here lies the issue—all the carbon offsets sold to JPMorgan Chase and guilt-ridden individuals
105900	110540	alike were calculated against a faulty baseline.
110540	115060	This is the project's planning document, submitted in 2018 to the American Carbon Registry,
115060	119300	and this is the baseline the project's built upon—that if it weren't for intervention,
119300	123200	the forest would be subject to aggressive clear-cutting and high grading.
123200	130020	The problem was, Hawk Mountain Preserve, as its name would suggest, was already a preserve.
130020	134300	Since the 1930s, after the land was purchased by avid birder Rosalie Edge and the Hawk Mountain
134300	139860	Sanctuary Association was set up, this area's been closely looked after, managed, and protected.
139860	144540	The forest didn't need saving—it wasn't under threat—a fact borne out by the preserve's
145020	147900	and its own contemporary staff saying as much.
147900	151780	Of course, if the forest wasn't under threat, then there wasn't much carbon dioxide here
151780	156660	to save from entering the atmosphere, and thus, there wasn't many real carbon offsets.
156660	161460	It's these very carbon offsets, cheap for the buyer but ultimately meaningless, that
161460	165600	allow corporations like JPMorgan Chase, the very institution that invested more money
165600	171420	in oil and gas than any other bank from 2016 to 2020, to make claims like this—that they
171420	175380	offset all company travel through projects like Hawk Mountain.
175380	179940	Carbon credits provide major companies an incredibly cheap green screen to hide behind
179940	185460	while their faulty offsets continually underdeliver, and this is hardly a problem unique to a bird
185460	187780	sanctuary in Pennsylvania.
187780	191340	Not far down the road from Hawk Mountain is Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
191340	196180	Here, the Nature Conservancy brokered a deal to protect 22,000 acres and establish an offset
196180	197660	market in 2011.
197660	202700	First, it was Chevrolet that bought into the project, then in 2014, it was Disney who agreed
202700	205180	to fund the area's protection through 2022.
205180	209300	While the project helped Disney establish itself as an industry-leading offsetter, it
209300	213860	did little to actually offset carbon emissions, as the baseline again assumed the area was
213860	216180	threatened by aggressive harvesting.
216180	220860	In reality, though, recognizing the importance of the forest to their municipal water, Bethlehem
220860	226080	had only actually harvested about 0.4% of the watershed's acreage in the prior two
226080	227120	decades.
227120	230960	The same thing happened here, in Albany, New York, where offsets from watershed forests
230960	234920	that hadn't been harvested in decades went up for sale in 2019.
234920	239040	And here, too, in a swath of forests known as Pennsylvania Ridges, where the Nature Conservancy
239040	244260	began selling carbon credits in 2019, even though the institution itself had purchased
244260	247920	the land in 1999 and preserved it ever since.
247920	253560	Uninformed of or undeterred by the faulty logic, Disney bought 180,000 credits from
253560	255000	the project.
255000	259440	Across all of these, meaningless offsets actively undercut their own mission, and these issues
259440	264920	extend well beyond the East Coast, and well outside of the Nature Conservancy's purview.
264920	269060	California's Cap-and-Trade program uses forest carbon projects so that heavy emitters
269060	274280	can purchase offsets rather than lower emissions, and this program, too, has holes.
274280	279840	Of the 193 million carbon offsets sold in the state, 156 million are forest credits,
279840	285280	and of those 156 million, 131 million are called Improved Forest Management Credits,
285280	286900	or IFMs.
286900	291360	These IFMs provide credits by implementing best practices to maintain maximum carbon
291360	292360	storage.
292360	296280	Basically, they commit the project area to minimal harvesting for the next century.
296280	301520	Now, in order to quantify the amount of credits each project produces, like with voluntary
301520	306640	programs, there needs to be a baseline, or an average common practice, to judge the IFM
306640	307640	against.
307640	311760	California calculates this common practice number by breaking forests into regions generally
311760	314800	informed by tree species and forest density.
314800	319520	Each region, in turn, has an average carbon carrying capacity, and it's these averages
319520	321060	that are the problem.
321060	323720	Take this swath of forest here in Northern California.
323720	328100	It's relatively wet, it's heavily wooded, it's composed primarily of large, dense
328100	332440	tanawak and douglas fir, and according to the state, it sits in the Southern Cascade
332440	333800	Supersection.
333800	337920	Because this supersection is so large, it encompasses, according to Carbon Plan's
337920	343560	research, three subregions of different ecological makeups where the two inland regions are relatively
343560	347120	drier, more sparse, and able to store less carbon.
347120	352500	Therefore, when creating a baseline for this project plot, ACR 189, the state used an average
352500	357760	informed by data that doesn't represent the local environment, and thus is artificially
357760	358760	low.
358760	363480	In their own analysis, which used more accurate and specific tree species data, Carbon Plan
363480	369360	estimated that the section was over-crediting ACR 189 by 50%, and while this example sits
369360	374280	on the upper end of over-allocation by this date, their research showed that of the 65
374280	380680	IFM projects they studied, 53 had over-allocated, leading to an over-crediting percentage of
380680	383240	29.4%.
383240	387760	By using such broad forest classifications, California's program had unintentionally
387760	392960	created meaningless carbon credits that quietly undercut their own emissions goals.
392960	397240	And this issue isn't confined to national borders either.
397240	402040	Around the world, project upon project is failing to live up to expectations.
402040	406360	In Brazil, the Paitre Surai made history by becoming the first indigenous tribe to sell
406360	411680	credits to protect their own forest—most visibly to FIFA in 2014, to offset emissions
411680	413480	from that year's World Cup.
413480	417280	The next year, however, diamonds were found in the protected land, and the forest was
417800	421520	quickly ripped to shreds by those looking for a quick profit—rendering the already
421520	423800	sold credits meaningless.
423800	428520	In a protected area of Cambodia that sold credits as forest coverage sat at 88%, independent
428520	434000	analysis by ProPublica and Descartes Labs found that coverage had since dropped to 46%
434000	438800	as state-sanctioned logging and population influx accelerated deforestation far faster
438800	440600	than the project promised.
440600	444600	In Indonesia, carbon offsets were sold to protect a span of forest for conversion into
444600	448760	Acadia plantations, despite the fact that the government had placed a moratorium on
448760	451400	plantation development in the area.
451400	456560	Among myriad other issues, Nikkei Asia found that three times more carbon was sold as credits
456560	459840	than the project was likely to actually offset.
459840	464520	Time and time and time again, projects are making their money upfront, and then failing
464520	469320	to live up to the long-term promise that encompasses the entirety of their value.
469320	474240	These forest projects fail to address all three vertices of the carbon offsetting triangle.
474240	478100	The trio of factors that make for theoretically effective crediting.
478100	482280	It makes intuitive sense, for example, that a proper carbon offset must be permanent or
482280	485080	that the rate of decline must be accounted for.
485080	489780	What makes this difficult, though, is monitoring illegal harvesting in remote areas, or projecting
489780	494660	future fire losses, or anticipating what climbing temperatures will do to the ecological makeup
494660	495820	of a forest.
495820	499200	The project also needs to ensure that the carbon they sequester isn't just leading
499200	503320	to increased emissions elsewhere—that the CO2 isn't leaking out.
503320	507520	It's one thing to protect a swath of forest in the developing world, but it's another
507520	511520	to ensure that doesn't lead to more aggressive clear-cutting elsewhere beyond the reach of
511520	513680	state authorities or even roads.
513680	518640	Finally, and perhaps of most difficulty, it's crucial for an offset project to prove that
518640	523200	the forest protection wouldn't have happened otherwise—a naturally speculative effort
523200	527880	with so many shades of gray that the Nature Conservancy, for example, can justify an offsetting
527880	531560	project on property that they themselves had already preserved.
531560	535520	At the core of this triangle, though, and largely the reason it isn't heated at every
535520	540880	turn, is the need for dogged monitoring and accounting—two management mechanisms, in
540880	545560	a field defined by price points and expedience, that require time and money and therefore
545560	548680	plague offsetting projects well beyond forestry.
548680	554520	Theoretically, though, if an offset scheme can verifiably determine a baseline, verifiably
554520	559960	account for or assure permanence, verifiably account for or prevent leakage, and verifiably
559960	563940	prove additionality, then it might actually work.
563940	568280	Under these constraints, well-intentioned actors have aimed to innovate more advanced,
568280	570880	more effective systems of carbon offsetting.
570880	577540	Perhaps the most promising of these alternatives stems from one surprisingly specific process.
577540	581280	This is the Kopal district of India's Karnataka state.
581280	586280	Roughly 1.4 million people are spread across its dry, rocky landscape, making a living
586280	589340	largely by growing groundnuts and grains.
589340	594100	Of this population, 99% rely on traditional cookstoves.
594100	598060	More often than not, that means they're using three-stone fires, where a trio of rocks
598060	604060	is used to elevate a pot over a fire fueled by wood, coal, dung, or other biomass fuels.
604060	609820	The Kopal district is in good company—globally, three billion of us rely on similar traditional
609820	610980	stoves for cooking.
610980	615780	They can be built and fueled simply by gathering what exists around us, but the advantages
615780	618140	pretty much end there.
618140	622860	The thermal efficiency of three-stone fires, as in the percent of heat created that actually
622860	625300	makes it to the pot, is just 10%.
625300	630940	That's colossally low, especially compared to the 75% thermal efficiency of the typical
630940	632260	electric stovetop.
632260	637340	Therefore, the average household that cooks on a three-stone fire uses between 11 and
637340	640980	26 pounds, or 5 and 12 kilograms, of wood per day.
640980	646220	Burning such a quantity of wood every single day clearly has a sizable environmental impact—in
646220	652100	fact, some 25% of global black carbon emissions, a damaging pollutant, stems from this style
652100	653100	of cooking.
653100	657820	Of course, those using three-stone fires do so out of necessity—they either can't
657820	662060	afford or don't have the infrastructure to support gas or electric stoves—but there
662060	664020	is an intermediate alternative.
664020	667180	It's called the improved cookstove.
667180	671980	Essentially, this is a catch-all term to describe biomass-fueled stoves with higher thermal
671980	674980	efficiency—often around 20 or 30%.
674980	678620	With higher thermal efficiency, the fuel need is lower, and so a household switching
678620	682900	from a three-stone fire to an improved cookstove is estimated to eliminate between one and
682900	685980	a half and four tons of carbon emissions per year.
685980	689660	This is a hefty amount—roughly equivalent to the average annual carbon footprint of
689660	693540	a whole person in one of these households, or to flying between New York and Singapore
693540	694820	five times.
694820	699780	So, replacing these with these would go a long way to reducing emissions, but the problem
699780	703200	is that improved cookstoves are expensive.
703240	707960	Their 1,400-rupee cost is equivalent to a week of income for the average Coppola district
707960	708960	resident.
708960	714680	However, 1,400-rupee is only 18 American dollars—a miniscule amount to pay to offset such an
714680	716840	amount of flying, for example.
716840	722800	Therefore, cookstove replacement was a prime candidate for financing through carbon credits—a
722800	727760	perfect solution where certain individuals value an action above its cost simply for
727760	729600	its environmental benefits.
729600	733660	On top of that, the math was simpler—the higher the thermal efficiency, the lower the
733660	735160	emissions should be.
735160	739680	Having identified that, NGOs globally started distributing improved cookstoves to households
739680	744260	reliant on the three-stone fire, including in the Coppola district, where 43,000 stoves
744260	750320	were distributed to 21,500 families in exchange for the organizers selling 43,215 tons of
750320	752960	carbon offsets per year for a decade.
752960	757600	Now, what takes the system of cookstove replacement carbon offsetting from theoretically good
757600	763840	to great is its myriad co-benefits—the advantages stretch beyond just environmental.
763840	769040	To start with, gathering those huge quantities of wood to fuel traditional stoves takes time—an
769040	771580	average of 18 hours a week, in fact.
771580	775400	Researchers have found that overwhelmingly, the task of gathering wood for cooking is
775400	780280	left to women and girls, and it takes time that would often otherwise be spent on education,
780280	781280	for example.
781280	785520	Therefore, the use of improved cookstoves, which require an average of only five hours
785520	789840	of wood gathering per week, could help close the education gender gap observed in many
789840	791380	poorer regions.
791380	795820	On top of that, cooking is typically completed inside one's house, so the smoke inhaled
795820	801640	by users of traditional cookstoves is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
801640	805920	Improved cookstoves do not eliminate smoke, but they do lessen it, so their distribution
805920	811220	works to eliminate some of the 4.3 million annual premature deaths attributable to household
811220	812720	air pollution.
812720	816960	Improved cookstove programs can also create local jobs manufacturing and maintaining stoves,
816960	822140	they can reduce unsustainable local deforestation—the co-benefits stretch on and on, and so it's
822140	826480	no wonder why, in the face of compounding stories of disastrously ineffective forest
826480	830800	protection programs, cookstove replacement was heralded by everyone from the United Nations
830800	835160	to Hillary Clinton as the next big innovation in carbon offsetting.
835160	840040	The math was simpler, the additionality was indisputable, the co-benefits were myriad,
840040	841540	and the costs were low.
841540	846120	These programs had the potential to finally offer carbon-conscious companies and consumers
846120	852180	a truly verifiable way to actually offset their impact on the world, so long as theory
852180	854640	translated into reality.
854640	858900	To test their program's effectiveness, researchers put hundreds of households in the Coppola
858900	863160	district into a test group—half were given the improved cookstoves immediately, and half
863160	865660	had to wait a year to act as the control group.
865660	869480	The researchers then tracked the various households' wood consumption to see how well it lined
869480	871200	up with the predicted decline.
871200	876300	With stoves increasing from 10 to 30% thermal efficiency, offsets were sold based on a theoretical
876300	879420	67% reduction in wood consumption.
879420	883940	What the researchers found was that when actually used on the ground in the Coppola district,
883940	889140	the improved cookstove households averaged 7.9 pounds or 3.6 kilograms in daily wood
889140	890140	consumption.
890140	896760	However, crucially, the control group used 9.3 pounds or 4.2 kilograms.
896760	901080	Improved cookstoves only led to a 15% decline in wood consumption.
901080	905540	So little that it couldn't even be considered statistically significant by the study.
905540	911780	That's to say, according to these results, hundreds of thousands of faulty carbon credits
911780	916260	were sold to individuals and companies who believed they were genuinely eliminating carbon
916260	920940	from the atmosphere—individuals who paid a premium over the forest protection alternative
920940	924900	to finance the purportedly more effective form of carbon offsetting.
924900	928800	What happened on the ground is that individuals' actions didn't conform to the optimistic
928800	931440	beliefs of the program's designers.
931440	935460	Almost half of the subject households didn't exclusively use the improved cookstoves—they
935460	938620	kept using their three-stone fires simultaneously.
938620	942980	This is a phenomenon so common that it has a dedicated term, stove stacking, and a whole
942980	945620	subset of research into its causes.
945620	950800	Broadly, stove stackers say they do so because it saves time—the more burners, the better.
950800	955100	That means that the main solution to stove stacking is giving each household more stoves,
955100	959160	but less carbon is going to be offset by the third stove as opposed to the first, given
959160	964400	less frequent use, so achieving the more verifiable version of a cookstove replacement program
964400	968120	comes with additional cost per ton offset.
968120	973480	Another core co-benefit of improved cookstoves is that they make cooking easier, but unsurprisingly,
973480	977120	making cooking easier often means people cook more.
977120	981440	There is almost always suppressed demand among traditional cookstove users, and so this makes
981440	985600	accounting for the carbon saved by the switch all the more difficult.
985600	990460	Given this difficulty, not all programs confront real-world conditions in their design.
990460	995100	United Nations Clean Development Mechanism-certified cookstove replacement programs are not required
995100	999180	to test the stoves and the extent of their fuel savings in the field.
999180	1002640	Program designers can base their math off laboratory tests, the tests that led to the
1002640	1006260	failed assumptions of the Köpple district program, such as measuring how much wood is
1006260	1010420	necessary with each stove type to boil a given unit of water.
1010420	1014200	Current independent certifiers, such as the Gold Standard, require real-world kitchen
1014200	1019640	performance tests, measuring actual wood consumption in the actual project location by actual users
1019640	1024880	over a span of days, but not all experts agree that the more stringent path is the correct
1024880	1025880	one.
1025880	1028920	Water boiling tests are quick, cheap, and easy.
1028920	1033060	Kitchen performance tests are slow, expensive, and complicated.
1033060	1037020	That cost has to be passed on to the ultimate purchaser of carbon credits, and so this opens
1037020	1039820	up a broader, more subjective question.
1039820	1043980	Is it really worth it to increase cost, to increase accuracy?
1043980	1048540	Many cookstove replacement programs, including those based on less-precise water boiling
1048540	1053940	tests, are genuinely effective, but more of the kitchen performance test-based versions
1053940	1055120	are effective.
1055120	1057920	So, is it worth increasing cost?
1057920	1062680	Is it worth risking fewer carbon credits sold to be more confident that those credits are
1062680	1064520	actually effective?
1064520	1068600	Right now, the market seems to say no.
1068600	1073060	The least accurate type of carbon offsetting programs, forest protection programs, are
1073060	1077380	generally the lowest cost and hold a majority of the carbon offsetting market.
1077380	1082020	Meanwhile, the theoretically most accurate type of carbon offsetting, direct air capture,
1082020	1086780	where complex machinery literally sucks carbon out of the air, is the most expensive and
1086780	1089900	barely exists at commercial scale.
1089900	1093420	Consumers in the carbon market are making their purchasing decisions as they always
1093420	1094420	do.
1094420	1099220	If it costs $10 to offset a ton of carbon through one program and $15 through another,
1099220	1101240	why would they pick the latter?
1101240	1106200	The public overwhelmingly has neither the ability nor the desire to analyze the particulars
1106200	1111220	of individual carbon offsetting programs, so the cheapest option presented to them almost
1111220	1112440	always wins.
1112440	1116560	But that cheapest option is the one with the greatest uncertainty over whether it will
1116560	1117560	actually work.
1117560	1121260	It's the one with the greatest potential for the numbers to be fudged by nefarious
1121260	1123520	players looking to turn a profit.
1123520	1127560	All the stories are about projects where the carbon offset was overstated.
1127560	1130880	None are about carbon offset being understated.
1130880	1135160	If people are given the opportunity to turn a profit by fudging the numbers, people are
1135160	1138340	going to turn a profit by fudging the numbers.
1138340	1143620	Not only is the market enabling this action, it's incentivizing it by funneling the vast
1143620	1149340	majority of money into the cheapest, least verifiable, most exploitable projects.
1149340	1153400	And this isn't one of those situations where perfect is the enemy of good.
1153400	1156500	Carbon offsets are a form of syntax.
1156500	1160240	Individuals and companies buy them to alleviate the cognitive dissonance that stems from doing
1160240	1162880	something that accelerates climate change.
1162880	1167020	Therefore, if a person decides to take that transatlantic flight because they can negate
1167020	1171240	their emissions concerns simply by checking the offset box at checkout, that offset has
1171240	1175000	to be 100% effective to not do harm.
1175000	1180880	If that offset is just 90% effective, if the offsetting potential is just slightly overstated,
1180880	1184800	if families cook just slightly more than expected due to the convenience of their new
1184800	1190240	and improved cookstoves, the environment is in a worse place than where it started due
1190240	1192280	to carbon offsets.
1192280	1196040	Any behavioral economist would agree that carbon offsetting does lead to at least some
1196040	1199800	individuals or companies omitting more than they would if it wasn't an option, so this
1199800	1202760	scenario is not a fantasy.
1202760	1207760	Therefore, carbon offsetting, a practice presented as an innovative solution to the world's
1207760	1214720	carbon problem, has an extremely high risk of actually raising emissions.
1214720	1219080	Whether it does that is an entirely different, unanswerable question.
1219080	1223160	Given the complexity of just accounting for the carbon offset by an individual program,
1223160	1228840	entering that industry-wide would be entirely impossible, but the potential is there.
1228840	1232520	It's not that every carbon offset program is a scam.
1232520	1236800	There are plenty of extremely well-managed programs run by people genuinely trying to
1236800	1243440	make the world better that have truly verifiable offsetting impact and truly advantageous co-benefits.
1243440	1249000	Carbon can be truly offset, but that's not what the market incentivizes.
1249000	1252240	The market incentivizes the scam.
1252240	1255120	The market incentivizes a race to the bottom.
1255120	1260600	The market incentivizes the scenario where carbon offsetting, as a cohesive phenomenon,
1260600	1267240	has genuine potential to accelerate our march towards climate catastrophe.
1267240	1270440	If you've made it to the end of this video, you've clearly realized that, believe it
1270440	1273540	or not, talking climate policy can actually be interesting.
1273540	1278520	The world is changing faster than ever, and as catastrophic as that is, it's also fascinating
1278520	1280400	to watch unfold in real time.
1280400	1283820	I've certainly realized that over the years, especially as I produce two documentaries
1283820	1287560	about the subject—one profiling the Marshall Islands, the country that's expected to
1287560	1291120	be the first to become uninhabitable due to sea level rise, and another looking at
1291120	1295120	the Colorado River, the primary water source for the American Southwest, which uses more
1295120	1298600	water than the environment provides each year, putting the region on the path towards an
1298600	1300800	imminent water shortage disaster.
1300800	1304880	Each of these projects was produced on location with a rather big budget thanks to the funding
1304880	1308960	provided by Nebula, and by extension, all the Nebula viewers, so you can watch both
1308960	1310380	of these over there.
1310380	1314080	Of course, Nebula is the streaming site that I and a bunch of other smart creators started
1314080	1316960	to act as the best possible home to the stuff we make.
1316960	1320880	We post our regular videos over there early and ad-free, exclusive videos we call Nebula
1320880	1323620	Plus, and high-budget Nebula originals.
1323620	1328800	We also release videos from our new channel, Jetlag the Game, an entire week early on Nebula.
1328800	1332800	Most of the channels with the highest audience overlap with Wendover are also on the platform,
1332800	1335640	so chances are you already watch plenty of Nebula creators.
1335640	1339520	But what makes this the best deal in streaming is that you can get two streaming sites for
1339520	1341360	less than the price of one.
