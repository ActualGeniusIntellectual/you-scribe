00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
In the summer of 2018, western Pennsylvania birders, ornithologists, biologists, field-tripping

00:06.480 --> 00:12.440
teachers, Appalachian Range romantics, and trail-loving hikers all had reason to celebrate.

00:12.440 --> 00:16.580
The Nature Conservancy, one of the nation's largest environmental NGOs, had partnered

00:16.580 --> 00:21.600
with the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary to preserve these 2,380 acres of wooded bird habitat some

00:21.600 --> 00:24.960
80 miles or 130 kilometers outside of Philadelphia.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.100
In the grand scheme of things, the move wasn't anything major.

00:29.100 --> 00:33.640
By itself, a massive environmental organization preserving an area the size of a small ski

00:33.640 --> 00:35.660
town didn't move the needle.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.200
But the deal was bigger than local interests alone.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.420
The benefits were global.

00:41.420 --> 00:45.540
To fund the preserve's protection, the Nature Conservancy, partnered with BlueSource, began

00:45.540 --> 00:49.900
selling carbon credits and, in an effort to offset emissions, JPMorgan Chase purchased

00:49.900 --> 00:51.940
over 96,000 of them.

00:51.940 --> 00:57.380
It wasn't just corporations buying in either—at just $15 a ton, individuals bought credits

00:57.380 --> 01:00.100
to account for their summer vacations, too.

01:00.100 --> 01:05.100
While small in scale, Hawk Mountain seemed a perfect project—a pragmatic effort that

01:05.100 --> 01:09.460
saved important habitat and refuge for local birds and people, and provided means for the

01:09.460 --> 01:13.200
environmentally conscious to address their own impact on the planet.

01:13.200 --> 01:17.980
The only problem was, as one intrepid investigative journalist would expose, it was all built

01:17.980 --> 01:25.420
on at best a massive oversimplification, and at worst, one big green lie.

01:25.460 --> 01:29.500
At the simplest level, forest carbon offset projects work by comparing the amount of forest

01:29.500 --> 01:33.740
preserved versus the assumed deforestation had it not been saved.

01:33.740 --> 01:38.100
This means that calculating a hypothetical baseline really informs the entire project

01:38.100 --> 01:40.340
and how many credits they can actually sell.

01:40.340 --> 01:45.900
And here lies the issue—all the carbon offsets sold to JPMorgan Chase and guilt-ridden individuals

01:45.900 --> 01:50.540
alike were calculated against a faulty baseline.

01:50.540 --> 01:55.060
This is the project's planning document, submitted in 2018 to the American Carbon Registry,

01:55.060 --> 01:59.300
and this is the baseline the project's built upon—that if it weren't for intervention,

01:59.300 --> 02:03.200
the forest would be subject to aggressive clear-cutting and high grading.

02:03.200 --> 02:10.020
The problem was, Hawk Mountain Preserve, as its name would suggest, was already a preserve.

02:10.020 --> 02:14.300
Since the 1930s, after the land was purchased by avid birder Rosalie Edge and the Hawk Mountain

02:14.300 --> 02:19.860
Sanctuary Association was set up, this area's been closely looked after, managed, and protected.

02:19.860 --> 02:24.540
The forest didn't need saving—it wasn't under threat—a fact borne out by the preserve's

02:25.020 --> 02:27.900
and its own contemporary staff saying as much.

02:27.900 --> 02:31.780
Of course, if the forest wasn't under threat, then there wasn't much carbon dioxide here

02:31.780 --> 02:36.660
to save from entering the atmosphere, and thus, there wasn't many real carbon offsets.

02:36.660 --> 02:41.460
It's these very carbon offsets, cheap for the buyer but ultimately meaningless, that

02:41.460 --> 02:45.600
allow corporations like JPMorgan Chase, the very institution that invested more money

02:45.600 --> 02:51.420
in oil and gas than any other bank from 2016 to 2020, to make claims like this—that they

02:51.420 --> 02:55.380
offset all company travel through projects like Hawk Mountain.

02:55.380 --> 02:59.940
Carbon credits provide major companies an incredibly cheap green screen to hide behind

02:59.940 --> 03:05.460
while their faulty offsets continually underdeliver, and this is hardly a problem unique to a bird

03:05.460 --> 03:07.780
sanctuary in Pennsylvania.

03:07.780 --> 03:11.340
Not far down the road from Hawk Mountain is Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

03:11.340 --> 03:16.180
Here, the Nature Conservancy brokered a deal to protect 22,000 acres and establish an offset

03:16.180 --> 03:17.660
market in 2011.

03:17.660 --> 03:22.700
First, it was Chevrolet that bought into the project, then in 2014, it was Disney who agreed

03:22.700 --> 03:25.180
to fund the area's protection through 2022.

03:25.180 --> 03:29.300
While the project helped Disney establish itself as an industry-leading offsetter, it

03:29.300 --> 03:33.860
did little to actually offset carbon emissions, as the baseline again assumed the area was

03:33.860 --> 03:36.180
threatened by aggressive harvesting.

03:36.180 --> 03:40.860
In reality, though, recognizing the importance of the forest to their municipal water, Bethlehem

03:40.860 --> 03:46.080
had only actually harvested about 0.4% of the watershed's acreage in the prior two

03:46.080 --> 03:47.120
decades.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.960
The same thing happened here, in Albany, New York, where offsets from watershed forests

03:50.960 --> 03:54.920
that hadn't been harvested in decades went up for sale in 2019.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.040
And here, too, in a swath of forests known as Pennsylvania Ridges, where the Nature Conservancy

03:59.040 --> 04:04.260
began selling carbon credits in 2019, even though the institution itself had purchased

04:04.260 --> 04:07.920
the land in 1999 and preserved it ever since.

04:07.920 --> 04:13.560
Uninformed of or undeterred by the faulty logic, Disney bought 180,000 credits from

04:13.560 --> 04:15.000
the project.

04:15.000 --> 04:19.440
Across all of these, meaningless offsets actively undercut their own mission, and these issues

04:19.440 --> 04:24.920
extend well beyond the East Coast, and well outside of the Nature Conservancy's purview.

04:24.920 --> 04:29.060
California's Cap-and-Trade program uses forest carbon projects so that heavy emitters

04:29.060 --> 04:34.280
can purchase offsets rather than lower emissions, and this program, too, has holes.

04:34.280 --> 04:39.840
Of the 193 million carbon offsets sold in the state, 156 million are forest credits,

04:39.840 --> 04:45.280
and of those 156 million, 131 million are called Improved Forest Management Credits,

04:45.280 --> 04:46.900
or IFMs.

04:46.900 --> 04:51.360
These IFMs provide credits by implementing best practices to maintain maximum carbon

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
storage.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.280
Basically, they commit the project area to minimal harvesting for the next century.

04:56.280 --> 05:01.520
Now, in order to quantify the amount of credits each project produces, like with voluntary

05:01.520 --> 05:06.640
programs, there needs to be a baseline, or an average common practice, to judge the IFM

05:06.640 --> 05:07.640
against.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.760
California calculates this common practice number by breaking forests into regions generally

05:11.760 --> 05:14.800
informed by tree species and forest density.

05:14.800 --> 05:19.520
Each region, in turn, has an average carbon carrying capacity, and it's these averages

05:19.520 --> 05:21.060
that are the problem.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.720
Take this swath of forest here in Northern California.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.100
It's relatively wet, it's heavily wooded, it's composed primarily of large, dense

05:28.100 --> 05:32.440
tanawak and douglas fir, and according to the state, it sits in the Southern Cascade

05:32.440 --> 05:33.800
Supersection.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.920
Because this supersection is so large, it encompasses, according to Carbon Plan's

05:37.920 --> 05:43.560
research, three subregions of different ecological makeups where the two inland regions are relatively

05:43.560 --> 05:47.120
drier, more sparse, and able to store less carbon.

05:47.120 --> 05:52.500
Therefore, when creating a baseline for this project plot, ACR 189, the state used an average

05:52.500 --> 05:57.760
informed by data that doesn't represent the local environment, and thus is artificially

05:57.760 --> 05:58.760
low.

05:58.760 --> 06:03.480
In their own analysis, which used more accurate and specific tree species data, Carbon Plan

06:03.480 --> 06:09.360
estimated that the section was over-crediting ACR 189 by 50%, and while this example sits

06:09.360 --> 06:14.280
on the upper end of over-allocation by this date, their research showed that of the 65

06:14.280 --> 06:20.680
IFM projects they studied, 53 had over-allocated, leading to an over-crediting percentage of

06:20.680 --> 06:23.240
29.4%.

06:23.240 --> 06:27.760
By using such broad forest classifications, California's program had unintentionally

06:27.760 --> 06:32.960
created meaningless carbon credits that quietly undercut their own emissions goals.

06:32.960 --> 06:37.240
And this issue isn't confined to national borders either.

06:37.240 --> 06:42.040
Around the world, project upon project is failing to live up to expectations.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.360
In Brazil, the Paitre Surai made history by becoming the first indigenous tribe to sell

06:46.360 --> 06:51.680
credits to protect their own forest—most visibly to FIFA in 2014, to offset emissions

06:51.680 --> 06:53.480
from that year's World Cup.

06:53.480 --> 06:57.280
The next year, however, diamonds were found in the protected land, and the forest was

06:57.800 --> 07:01.520
quickly ripped to shreds by those looking for a quick profit—rendering the already

07:01.520 --> 07:03.800
sold credits meaningless.

07:03.800 --> 07:08.520
In a protected area of Cambodia that sold credits as forest coverage sat at 88%, independent

07:08.520 --> 07:14.000
analysis by ProPublica and Descartes Labs found that coverage had since dropped to 46%

07:14.000 --> 07:18.800
as state-sanctioned logging and population influx accelerated deforestation far faster

07:18.800 --> 07:20.600
than the project promised.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.600
In Indonesia, carbon offsets were sold to protect a span of forest for conversion into

07:24.600 --> 07:28.760
Acadia plantations, despite the fact that the government had placed a moratorium on

07:28.760 --> 07:31.400
plantation development in the area.

07:31.400 --> 07:36.560
Among myriad other issues, Nikkei Asia found that three times more carbon was sold as credits

07:36.560 --> 07:39.840
than the project was likely to actually offset.

07:39.840 --> 07:44.520
Time and time and time again, projects are making their money upfront, and then failing

07:44.520 --> 07:49.320
to live up to the long-term promise that encompasses the entirety of their value.

07:49.320 --> 07:54.240
These forest projects fail to address all three vertices of the carbon offsetting triangle.

07:54.240 --> 07:58.100
The trio of factors that make for theoretically effective crediting.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.280
It makes intuitive sense, for example, that a proper carbon offset must be permanent or

08:02.280 --> 08:05.080
that the rate of decline must be accounted for.

08:05.080 --> 08:09.780
What makes this difficult, though, is monitoring illegal harvesting in remote areas, or projecting

08:09.780 --> 08:14.660
future fire losses, or anticipating what climbing temperatures will do to the ecological makeup

08:14.660 --> 08:15.820
of a forest.

08:15.820 --> 08:19.200
The project also needs to ensure that the carbon they sequester isn't just leading

08:19.200 --> 08:23.320
to increased emissions elsewhere—that the CO2 isn't leaking out.

08:23.320 --> 08:27.520
It's one thing to protect a swath of forest in the developing world, but it's another

08:27.520 --> 08:31.520
to ensure that doesn't lead to more aggressive clear-cutting elsewhere beyond the reach of

08:31.520 --> 08:33.680
state authorities or even roads.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.640
Finally, and perhaps of most difficulty, it's crucial for an offset project to prove that

08:38.640 --> 08:43.200
the forest protection wouldn't have happened otherwise—a naturally speculative effort

08:43.200 --> 08:47.880
with so many shades of gray that the Nature Conservancy, for example, can justify an offsetting

08:47.880 --> 08:51.560
project on property that they themselves had already preserved.

08:51.560 --> 08:55.520
At the core of this triangle, though, and largely the reason it isn't heated at every

08:55.520 --> 09:00.880
turn, is the need for dogged monitoring and accounting—two management mechanisms, in

09:00.880 --> 09:05.560
a field defined by price points and expedience, that require time and money and therefore

09:05.560 --> 09:08.680
plague offsetting projects well beyond forestry.

09:08.680 --> 09:14.520
Theoretically, though, if an offset scheme can verifiably determine a baseline, verifiably

09:14.520 --> 09:19.960
account for or assure permanence, verifiably account for or prevent leakage, and verifiably

09:19.960 --> 09:23.940
prove additionality, then it might actually work.

09:23.940 --> 09:28.280
Under these constraints, well-intentioned actors have aimed to innovate more advanced,

09:28.280 --> 09:30.880
more effective systems of carbon offsetting.

09:30.880 --> 09:37.540
Perhaps the most promising of these alternatives stems from one surprisingly specific process.

09:37.540 --> 09:41.280
This is the Kopal district of India's Karnataka state.

09:41.280 --> 09:46.280
Roughly 1.4 million people are spread across its dry, rocky landscape, making a living

09:46.280 --> 09:49.340
largely by growing groundnuts and grains.

09:49.340 --> 09:54.100
Of this population, 99% rely on traditional cookstoves.

09:54.100 --> 09:58.060
More often than not, that means they're using three-stone fires, where a trio of rocks

09:58.060 --> 10:04.060
is used to elevate a pot over a fire fueled by wood, coal, dung, or other biomass fuels.

10:04.060 --> 10:09.820
The Kopal district is in good company—globally, three billion of us rely on similar traditional

10:09.820 --> 10:10.980
stoves for cooking.

10:10.980 --> 10:15.780
They can be built and fueled simply by gathering what exists around us, but the advantages

10:15.780 --> 10:18.140
pretty much end there.

10:18.140 --> 10:22.860
The thermal efficiency of three-stone fires, as in the percent of heat created that actually

10:22.860 --> 10:25.300
makes it to the pot, is just 10%.

10:25.300 --> 10:30.940
That's colossally low, especially compared to the 75% thermal efficiency of the typical

10:30.940 --> 10:32.260
electric stovetop.

10:32.260 --> 10:37.340
Therefore, the average household that cooks on a three-stone fire uses between 11 and

10:37.340 --> 10:40.980
26 pounds, or 5 and 12 kilograms, of wood per day.

10:40.980 --> 10:46.220
Burning such a quantity of wood every single day clearly has a sizable environmental impact—in

10:46.220 --> 10:52.100
fact, some 25% of global black carbon emissions, a damaging pollutant, stems from this style

10:52.100 --> 10:53.100
of cooking.

10:53.100 --> 10:57.820
Of course, those using three-stone fires do so out of necessity—they either can't

10:57.820 --> 11:02.060
afford or don't have the infrastructure to support gas or electric stoves—but there

11:02.060 --> 11:04.020
is an intermediate alternative.

11:04.020 --> 11:07.180
It's called the improved cookstove.

11:07.180 --> 11:11.980
Essentially, this is a catch-all term to describe biomass-fueled stoves with higher thermal

11:11.980 --> 11:14.980
efficiency—often around 20 or 30%.

11:14.980 --> 11:18.620
With higher thermal efficiency, the fuel need is lower, and so a household switching

11:18.620 --> 11:22.900
from a three-stone fire to an improved cookstove is estimated to eliminate between one and

11:22.900 --> 11:25.980
a half and four tons of carbon emissions per year.

11:25.980 --> 11:29.660
This is a hefty amount—roughly equivalent to the average annual carbon footprint of

11:29.660 --> 11:33.540
a whole person in one of these households, or to flying between New York and Singapore

11:33.540 --> 11:34.820
five times.

11:34.820 --> 11:39.780
So, replacing these with these would go a long way to reducing emissions, but the problem

11:39.780 --> 11:43.200
is that improved cookstoves are expensive.

11:43.240 --> 11:47.960
Their 1,400-rupee cost is equivalent to a week of income for the average Coppola district

11:47.960 --> 11:48.960
resident.

11:48.960 --> 11:54.680
However, 1,400-rupee is only 18 American dollars—a miniscule amount to pay to offset such an

11:54.680 --> 11:56.840
amount of flying, for example.

11:56.840 --> 12:02.800
Therefore, cookstove replacement was a prime candidate for financing through carbon credits—a

12:02.800 --> 12:07.760
perfect solution where certain individuals value an action above its cost simply for

12:07.760 --> 12:09.600
its environmental benefits.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.660
On top of that, the math was simpler—the higher the thermal efficiency, the lower the

12:13.660 --> 12:15.160
emissions should be.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.680
Having identified that, NGOs globally started distributing improved cookstoves to households

12:19.680 --> 12:24.260
reliant on the three-stone fire, including in the Coppola district, where 43,000 stoves

12:24.260 --> 12:30.320
were distributed to 21,500 families in exchange for the organizers selling 43,215 tons of

12:30.320 --> 12:32.960
carbon offsets per year for a decade.

12:32.960 --> 12:37.600
Now, what takes the system of cookstove replacement carbon offsetting from theoretically good

12:37.600 --> 12:43.840
to great is its myriad co-benefits—the advantages stretch beyond just environmental.

12:43.840 --> 12:49.040
To start with, gathering those huge quantities of wood to fuel traditional stoves takes time—an

12:49.040 --> 12:51.580
average of 18 hours a week, in fact.

12:51.580 --> 12:55.400
Researchers have found that overwhelmingly, the task of gathering wood for cooking is

12:55.400 --> 13:00.280
left to women and girls, and it takes time that would often otherwise be spent on education,

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
for example.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.520
Therefore, the use of improved cookstoves, which require an average of only five hours

13:05.520 --> 13:09.840
of wood gathering per week, could help close the education gender gap observed in many

13:09.840 --> 13:11.380
poorer regions.

13:11.380 --> 13:15.820
On top of that, cooking is typically completed inside one's house, so the smoke inhaled

13:15.820 --> 13:21.640
by users of traditional cookstoves is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.920
Improved cookstoves do not eliminate smoke, but they do lessen it, so their distribution

13:25.920 --> 13:31.220
works to eliminate some of the 4.3 million annual premature deaths attributable to household

13:31.220 --> 13:32.720
air pollution.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.960
Improved cookstove programs can also create local jobs manufacturing and maintaining stoves,

13:36.960 --> 13:42.140
they can reduce unsustainable local deforestation—the co-benefits stretch on and on, and so it's

13:42.140 --> 13:46.480
no wonder why, in the face of compounding stories of disastrously ineffective forest

13:46.480 --> 13:50.800
protection programs, cookstove replacement was heralded by everyone from the United Nations

13:50.800 --> 13:55.160
to Hillary Clinton as the next big innovation in carbon offsetting.

13:55.160 --> 14:00.040
The math was simpler, the additionality was indisputable, the co-benefits were myriad,

14:00.040 --> 14:01.540
and the costs were low.

14:01.540 --> 14:06.120
These programs had the potential to finally offer carbon-conscious companies and consumers

14:06.120 --> 14:12.180
a truly verifiable way to actually offset their impact on the world, so long as theory

14:12.180 --> 14:14.640
translated into reality.

14:14.640 --> 14:18.900
To test their program's effectiveness, researchers put hundreds of households in the Coppola

14:18.900 --> 14:23.160
district into a test group—half were given the improved cookstoves immediately, and half

14:23.160 --> 14:25.660
had to wait a year to act as the control group.

14:25.660 --> 14:29.480
The researchers then tracked the various households' wood consumption to see how well it lined

14:29.480 --> 14:31.200
up with the predicted decline.

14:31.200 --> 14:36.300
With stoves increasing from 10 to 30% thermal efficiency, offsets were sold based on a theoretical

14:36.300 --> 14:39.420
67% reduction in wood consumption.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.940
What the researchers found was that when actually used on the ground in the Coppola district,

14:43.940 --> 14:49.140
the improved cookstove households averaged 7.9 pounds or 3.6 kilograms in daily wood

14:49.140 --> 14:50.140
consumption.

14:50.140 --> 14:56.760
However, crucially, the control group used 9.3 pounds or 4.2 kilograms.

14:56.760 --> 15:01.080
Improved cookstoves only led to a 15% decline in wood consumption.

15:01.080 --> 15:05.540
So little that it couldn't even be considered statistically significant by the study.

15:05.540 --> 15:11.780
That's to say, according to these results, hundreds of thousands of faulty carbon credits

15:11.780 --> 15:16.260
were sold to individuals and companies who believed they were genuinely eliminating carbon

15:16.260 --> 15:20.940
from the atmosphere—individuals who paid a premium over the forest protection alternative

15:20.940 --> 15:24.900
to finance the purportedly more effective form of carbon offsetting.

15:24.900 --> 15:28.800
What happened on the ground is that individuals' actions didn't conform to the optimistic

15:28.800 --> 15:31.440
beliefs of the program's designers.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.460
Almost half of the subject households didn't exclusively use the improved cookstoves—they

15:35.460 --> 15:38.620
kept using their three-stone fires simultaneously.

15:38.620 --> 15:42.980
This is a phenomenon so common that it has a dedicated term, stove stacking, and a whole

15:42.980 --> 15:45.620
subset of research into its causes.

15:45.620 --> 15:50.800
Broadly, stove stackers say they do so because it saves time—the more burners, the better.

15:50.800 --> 15:55.100
That means that the main solution to stove stacking is giving each household more stoves,

15:55.100 --> 15:59.160
but less carbon is going to be offset by the third stove as opposed to the first, given

15:59.160 --> 16:04.400
less frequent use, so achieving the more verifiable version of a cookstove replacement program

16:04.400 --> 16:08.120
comes with additional cost per ton offset.

16:08.120 --> 16:13.480
Another core co-benefit of improved cookstoves is that they make cooking easier, but unsurprisingly,

16:13.480 --> 16:17.120
making cooking easier often means people cook more.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.440
There is almost always suppressed demand among traditional cookstove users, and so this makes

16:21.440 --> 16:25.600
accounting for the carbon saved by the switch all the more difficult.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.460
Given this difficulty, not all programs confront real-world conditions in their design.

16:30.460 --> 16:35.100
United Nations Clean Development Mechanism-certified cookstove replacement programs are not required

16:35.100 --> 16:39.180
to test the stoves and the extent of their fuel savings in the field.

16:39.180 --> 16:42.640
Program designers can base their math off laboratory tests, the tests that led to the

16:42.640 --> 16:46.260
failed assumptions of the Köpple district program, such as measuring how much wood is

16:46.260 --> 16:50.420
necessary with each stove type to boil a given unit of water.

16:50.420 --> 16:54.200
Current independent certifiers, such as the Gold Standard, require real-world kitchen

16:54.200 --> 16:59.640
performance tests, measuring actual wood consumption in the actual project location by actual users

16:59.640 --> 17:04.880
over a span of days, but not all experts agree that the more stringent path is the correct

17:04.880 --> 17:05.880
one.

17:05.880 --> 17:08.920
Water boiling tests are quick, cheap, and easy.

17:08.920 --> 17:13.060
Kitchen performance tests are slow, expensive, and complicated.

17:13.060 --> 17:17.020
That cost has to be passed on to the ultimate purchaser of carbon credits, and so this opens

17:17.020 --> 17:19.820
up a broader, more subjective question.

17:19.820 --> 17:23.980
Is it really worth it to increase cost, to increase accuracy?

17:23.980 --> 17:28.540
Many cookstove replacement programs, including those based on less-precise water boiling

17:28.540 --> 17:33.940
tests, are genuinely effective, but more of the kitchen performance test-based versions

17:33.940 --> 17:35.120
are effective.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.920
So, is it worth increasing cost?

17:37.920 --> 17:42.680
Is it worth risking fewer carbon credits sold to be more confident that those credits are

17:42.680 --> 17:44.520
actually effective?

17:44.520 --> 17:48.600
Right now, the market seems to say no.

17:48.600 --> 17:53.060
The least accurate type of carbon offsetting programs, forest protection programs, are

17:53.060 --> 17:57.380
generally the lowest cost and hold a majority of the carbon offsetting market.

17:57.380 --> 18:02.020
Meanwhile, the theoretically most accurate type of carbon offsetting, direct air capture,

18:02.020 --> 18:06.780
where complex machinery literally sucks carbon out of the air, is the most expensive and

18:06.780 --> 18:09.900
barely exists at commercial scale.

18:09.900 --> 18:13.420
Consumers in the carbon market are making their purchasing decisions as they always

18:13.420 --> 18:14.420
do.

18:14.420 --> 18:19.220
If it costs $10 to offset a ton of carbon through one program and $15 through another,

18:19.220 --> 18:21.240
why would they pick the latter?

18:21.240 --> 18:26.200
The public overwhelmingly has neither the ability nor the desire to analyze the particulars

18:26.200 --> 18:31.220
of individual carbon offsetting programs, so the cheapest option presented to them almost

18:31.220 --> 18:32.440
always wins.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.560
But that cheapest option is the one with the greatest uncertainty over whether it will

18:36.560 --> 18:37.560
actually work.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.260
It's the one with the greatest potential for the numbers to be fudged by nefarious

18:41.260 --> 18:43.520
players looking to turn a profit.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.560
All the stories are about projects where the carbon offset was overstated.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.880
None are about carbon offset being understated.

18:50.880 --> 18:55.160
If people are given the opportunity to turn a profit by fudging the numbers, people are

18:55.160 --> 18:58.340
going to turn a profit by fudging the numbers.

18:58.340 --> 19:03.620
Not only is the market enabling this action, it's incentivizing it by funneling the vast

19:03.620 --> 19:09.340
majority of money into the cheapest, least verifiable, most exploitable projects.

19:09.340 --> 19:13.400
And this isn't one of those situations where perfect is the enemy of good.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.500
Carbon offsets are a form of syntax.

19:16.500 --> 19:20.240
Individuals and companies buy them to alleviate the cognitive dissonance that stems from doing

19:20.240 --> 19:22.880
something that accelerates climate change.

19:22.880 --> 19:27.020
Therefore, if a person decides to take that transatlantic flight because they can negate

19:27.020 --> 19:31.240
their emissions concerns simply by checking the offset box at checkout, that offset has

19:31.240 --> 19:35.000
to be 100% effective to not do harm.

19:35.000 --> 19:40.880
If that offset is just 90% effective, if the offsetting potential is just slightly overstated,

19:40.880 --> 19:44.800
if families cook just slightly more than expected due to the convenience of their new

19:44.800 --> 19:50.240
and improved cookstoves, the environment is in a worse place than where it started due

19:50.240 --> 19:52.280
to carbon offsets.

19:52.280 --> 19:56.040
Any behavioral economist would agree that carbon offsetting does lead to at least some

19:56.040 --> 19:59.800
individuals or companies omitting more than they would if it wasn't an option, so this

19:59.800 --> 20:02.760
scenario is not a fantasy.

20:02.760 --> 20:07.760
Therefore, carbon offsetting, a practice presented as an innovative solution to the world's

20:07.760 --> 20:14.720
carbon problem, has an extremely high risk of actually raising emissions.

20:14.720 --> 20:19.080
Whether it does that is an entirely different, unanswerable question.

20:19.080 --> 20:23.160
Given the complexity of just accounting for the carbon offset by an individual program,

20:23.160 --> 20:28.840
entering that industry-wide would be entirely impossible, but the potential is there.

20:28.840 --> 20:32.520
It's not that every carbon offset program is a scam.

20:32.520 --> 20:36.800
There are plenty of extremely well-managed programs run by people genuinely trying to

20:36.800 --> 20:43.440
make the world better that have truly verifiable offsetting impact and truly advantageous co-benefits.

20:43.440 --> 20:49.000
Carbon can be truly offset, but that's not what the market incentivizes.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.240
The market incentivizes the scam.

20:52.240 --> 20:55.120
The market incentivizes a race to the bottom.

20:55.120 --> 21:00.600
The market incentivizes the scenario where carbon offsetting, as a cohesive phenomenon,

21:00.600 --> 21:07.240
has genuine potential to accelerate our march towards climate catastrophe.

21:07.240 --> 21:10.440
If you've made it to the end of this video, you've clearly realized that, believe it

21:10.440 --> 21:13.540
or not, talking climate policy can actually be interesting.

21:13.540 --> 21:18.520
The world is changing faster than ever, and as catastrophic as that is, it's also fascinating

21:18.520 --> 21:20.400
to watch unfold in real time.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.820
I've certainly realized that over the years, especially as I produce two documentaries

21:23.820 --> 21:27.560
about the subject—one profiling the Marshall Islands, the country that's expected to

21:27.560 --> 21:31.120
be the first to become uninhabitable due to sea level rise, and another looking at

21:31.120 --> 21:35.120
the Colorado River, the primary water source for the American Southwest, which uses more

21:35.120 --> 21:38.600
water than the environment provides each year, putting the region on the path towards an

21:38.600 --> 21:40.800
imminent water shortage disaster.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.880
Each of these projects was produced on location with a rather big budget thanks to the funding

21:44.880 --> 21:48.960
provided by Nebula, and by extension, all the Nebula viewers, so you can watch both

21:48.960 --> 21:50.380
of these over there.

21:50.380 --> 21:54.080
Of course, Nebula is the streaming site that I and a bunch of other smart creators started

21:54.080 --> 21:56.960
to act as the best possible home to the stuff we make.

21:56.960 --> 22:00.880
We post our regular videos over there early and ad-free, exclusive videos we call Nebula

22:00.880 --> 22:03.620
Plus, and high-budget Nebula originals.

22:03.620 --> 22:08.800
We also release videos from our new channel, Jetlag the Game, an entire week early on Nebula.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.800
Most of the channels with the highest audience overlap with Wendover are also on the platform,

22:12.800 --> 22:15.640
so chances are you already watch plenty of Nebula creators.

22:15.640 --> 22:19.520
But what makes this the best deal in streaming is that you can get two streaming sites for

22:19.520 --> 22:21.360
less than the price of one.
