1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
In the summer of 2018, western Pennsylvania birders, ornithologists, biologists, field-tripping

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,440
teachers, Appalachian Range romantics, and trail-loving hikers all had reason to celebrate.

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,580
The Nature Conservancy, one of the nation's largest environmental NGOs, had partnered

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,600
with the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary to preserve these 2,380 acres of wooded bird habitat some

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
80 miles or 130 kilometers outside of Philadelphia.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,100
In the grand scheme of things, the move wasn't anything major.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,640
By itself, a massive environmental organization preserving an area the size of a small ski

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,660
town didn't move the needle.

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,200
But the deal was bigger than local interests alone.

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,420
The benefits were global.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,540
To fund the preserve's protection, the Nature Conservancy, partnered with BlueSource, began

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,900
selling carbon credits and, in an effort to offset emissions, JPMorgan Chase purchased

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,940
over 96,000 of them.

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,380
It wasn't just corporations buying in either—at just $15 a ton, individuals bought credits

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,100
to account for their summer vacations, too.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,100
While small in scale, Hawk Mountain seemed a perfect project—a pragmatic effort that

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,460
saved important habitat and refuge for local birds and people, and provided means for the

18
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,200
environmentally conscious to address their own impact on the planet.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,980
The only problem was, as one intrepid investigative journalist would expose, it was all built

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:25,420
on at best a massive oversimplification, and at worst, one big green lie.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,500
At the simplest level, forest carbon offset projects work by comparing the amount of forest

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,740
preserved versus the assumed deforestation had it not been saved.

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,100
This means that calculating a hypothetical baseline really informs the entire project

24
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,340
and how many credits they can actually sell.

25
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,900
And here lies the issue—all the carbon offsets sold to JPMorgan Chase and guilt-ridden individuals

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,540
alike were calculated against a faulty baseline.

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,060
This is the project's planning document, submitted in 2018 to the American Carbon Registry,

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,300
and this is the baseline the project's built upon—that if it weren't for intervention,

29
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,200
the forest would be subject to aggressive clear-cutting and high grading.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,020
The problem was, Hawk Mountain Preserve, as its name would suggest, was already a preserve.

31
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,300
Since the 1930s, after the land was purchased by avid birder Rosalie Edge and the Hawk Mountain

32
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,860
Sanctuary Association was set up, this area's been closely looked after, managed, and protected.

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,540
The forest didn't need saving—it wasn't under threat—a fact borne out by the preserve's

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,900
and its own contemporary staff saying as much.

35
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,780
Of course, if the forest wasn't under threat, then there wasn't much carbon dioxide here

36
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,660
to save from entering the atmosphere, and thus, there wasn't many real carbon offsets.

37
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,460
It's these very carbon offsets, cheap for the buyer but ultimately meaningless, that

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,600
allow corporations like JPMorgan Chase, the very institution that invested more money

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,420
in oil and gas than any other bank from 2016 to 2020, to make claims like this—that they

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,380
offset all company travel through projects like Hawk Mountain.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,940
Carbon credits provide major companies an incredibly cheap green screen to hide behind

42
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:05,460
while their faulty offsets continually underdeliver, and this is hardly a problem unique to a bird

43
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,780
sanctuary in Pennsylvania.

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,340
Not far down the road from Hawk Mountain is Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

45
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,180
Here, the Nature Conservancy brokered a deal to protect 22,000 acres and establish an offset

46
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,660
market in 2011.

47
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,700
First, it was Chevrolet that bought into the project, then in 2014, it was Disney who agreed

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,180
to fund the area's protection through 2022.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,300
While the project helped Disney establish itself as an industry-leading offsetter, it

50
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,860
did little to actually offset carbon emissions, as the baseline again assumed the area was

51
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,180
threatened by aggressive harvesting.

52
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,860
In reality, though, recognizing the importance of the forest to their municipal water, Bethlehem

53
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,080
had only actually harvested about 0.4% of the watershed's acreage in the prior two

54
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
decades.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,960
The same thing happened here, in Albany, New York, where offsets from watershed forests

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,920
that hadn't been harvested in decades went up for sale in 2019.

57
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:59,040
And here, too, in a swath of forests known as Pennsylvania Ridges, where the Nature Conservancy

58
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,260
began selling carbon credits in 2019, even though the institution itself had purchased

59
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,920
the land in 1999 and preserved it ever since.

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,560
Uninformed of or undeterred by the faulty logic, Disney bought 180,000 credits from

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,000
the project.

62
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,440
Across all of these, meaningless offsets actively undercut their own mission, and these issues

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,920
extend well beyond the East Coast, and well outside of the Nature Conservancy's purview.

64
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,060
California's Cap-and-Trade program uses forest carbon projects so that heavy emitters

65
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,280
can purchase offsets rather than lower emissions, and this program, too, has holes.

66
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,840
Of the 193 million carbon offsets sold in the state, 156 million are forest credits,

67
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,280
and of those 156 million, 131 million are called Improved Forest Management Credits,

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,900
or IFMs.

69
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,360
These IFMs provide credits by implementing best practices to maintain maximum carbon

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
storage.

71
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,280
Basically, they commit the project area to minimal harvesting for the next century.

72
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,520
Now, in order to quantify the amount of credits each project produces, like with voluntary

73
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,640
programs, there needs to be a baseline, or an average common practice, to judge the IFM

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
against.

75
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,760
California calculates this common practice number by breaking forests into regions generally

76
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,800
informed by tree species and forest density.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,520
Each region, in turn, has an average carbon carrying capacity, and it's these averages

78
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,060
that are the problem.

79
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,720
Take this swath of forest here in Northern California.

80
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,100
It's relatively wet, it's heavily wooded, it's composed primarily of large, dense

81
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,440
tanawak and douglas fir, and according to the state, it sits in the Southern Cascade

82
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,800
Supersection.

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,920
Because this supersection is so large, it encompasses, according to Carbon Plan's

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,560
research, three subregions of different ecological makeups where the two inland regions are relatively

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,120
drier, more sparse, and able to store less carbon.

86
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,500
Therefore, when creating a baseline for this project plot, ACR 189, the state used an average

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,760
informed by data that doesn't represent the local environment, and thus is artificially

88
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
low.

89
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,480
In their own analysis, which used more accurate and specific tree species data, Carbon Plan

90
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:09,360
estimated that the section was over-crediting ACR 189 by 50%, and while this example sits

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,280
on the upper end of over-allocation by this date, their research showed that of the 65

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,680
IFM projects they studied, 53 had over-allocated, leading to an over-crediting percentage of

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,240
29.4%.

94
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,760
By using such broad forest classifications, California's program had unintentionally

95
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,960
created meaningless carbon credits that quietly undercut their own emissions goals.

96
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,240
And this issue isn't confined to national borders either.

97
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,040
Around the world, project upon project is failing to live up to expectations.

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,360
In Brazil, the Paitre Surai made history by becoming the first indigenous tribe to sell

99
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,680
credits to protect their own forest—most visibly to FIFA in 2014, to offset emissions

100
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,480
from that year's World Cup.

101
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,280
The next year, however, diamonds were found in the protected land, and the forest was

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,520
quickly ripped to shreds by those looking for a quick profit—rendering the already

103
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,800
sold credits meaningless.

104
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,520
In a protected area of Cambodia that sold credits as forest coverage sat at 88%, independent

105
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,000
analysis by ProPublica and Descartes Labs found that coverage had since dropped to 46%

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,800
as state-sanctioned logging and population influx accelerated deforestation far faster

107
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
than the project promised.

108
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
In Indonesia, carbon offsets were sold to protect a span of forest for conversion into

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,760
Acadia plantations, despite the fact that the government had placed a moratorium on

110
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,400
plantation development in the area.

111
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,560
Among myriad other issues, Nikkei Asia found that three times more carbon was sold as credits

112
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,840
than the project was likely to actually offset.

113
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,520
Time and time and time again, projects are making their money upfront, and then failing

114
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,320
to live up to the long-term promise that encompasses the entirety of their value.

115
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,240
These forest projects fail to address all three vertices of the carbon offsetting triangle.

116
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,100
The trio of factors that make for theoretically effective crediting.

117
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,280
It makes intuitive sense, for example, that a proper carbon offset must be permanent or

118
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,080
that the rate of decline must be accounted for.

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,780
What makes this difficult, though, is monitoring illegal harvesting in remote areas, or projecting

120
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,660
future fire losses, or anticipating what climbing temperatures will do to the ecological makeup

121
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,820
of a forest.

122
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,200
The project also needs to ensure that the carbon they sequester isn't just leading

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,320
to increased emissions elsewhere—that the CO2 isn't leaking out.

124
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,520
It's one thing to protect a swath of forest in the developing world, but it's another

125
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
to ensure that doesn't lead to more aggressive clear-cutting elsewhere beyond the reach of

126
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,680
state authorities or even roads.

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,640
Finally, and perhaps of most difficulty, it's crucial for an offset project to prove that

128
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,200
the forest protection wouldn't have happened otherwise—a naturally speculative effort

129
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,880
with so many shades of gray that the Nature Conservancy, for example, can justify an offsetting

130
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,560
project on property that they themselves had already preserved.

131
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,520
At the core of this triangle, though, and largely the reason it isn't heated at every

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,880
turn, is the need for dogged monitoring and accounting—two management mechanisms, in

133
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,560
a field defined by price points and expedience, that require time and money and therefore

134
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,680
plague offsetting projects well beyond forestry.

135
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,520
Theoretically, though, if an offset scheme can verifiably determine a baseline, verifiably

136
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,960
account for or assure permanence, verifiably account for or prevent leakage, and verifiably

137
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,940
prove additionality, then it might actually work.

138
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,280
Under these constraints, well-intentioned actors have aimed to innovate more advanced,

139
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,880
more effective systems of carbon offsetting.

140
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,540
Perhaps the most promising of these alternatives stems from one surprisingly specific process.

141
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,280
This is the Kopal district of India's Karnataka state.

142
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Roughly 1.4 million people are spread across its dry, rocky landscape, making a living

143
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,340
largely by growing groundnuts and grains.

144
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:54,100
Of this population, 99% rely on traditional cookstoves.

145
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,060
More often than not, that means they're using three-stone fires, where a trio of rocks

146
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:04,060
is used to elevate a pot over a fire fueled by wood, coal, dung, or other biomass fuels.

147
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,820
The Kopal district is in good company—globally, three billion of us rely on similar traditional

148
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,980
stoves for cooking.

149
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,780
They can be built and fueled simply by gathering what exists around us, but the advantages

150
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,140
pretty much end there.

151
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,860
The thermal efficiency of three-stone fires, as in the percent of heat created that actually

152
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,300
makes it to the pot, is just 10%.

153
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,940
That's colossally low, especially compared to the 75% thermal efficiency of the typical

154
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,260
electric stovetop.

155
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,340
Therefore, the average household that cooks on a three-stone fire uses between 11 and

156
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,980
26 pounds, or 5 and 12 kilograms, of wood per day.

157
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,220
Burning such a quantity of wood every single day clearly has a sizable environmental impact—in

158
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,100
fact, some 25% of global black carbon emissions, a damaging pollutant, stems from this style

159
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
of cooking.

160
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,820
Of course, those using three-stone fires do so out of necessity—they either can't

161
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,060
afford or don't have the infrastructure to support gas or electric stoves—but there

162
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,020
is an intermediate alternative.

163
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,180
It's called the improved cookstove.

164
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,980
Essentially, this is a catch-all term to describe biomass-fueled stoves with higher thermal

165
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,980
efficiency—often around 20 or 30%.

166
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,620
With higher thermal efficiency, the fuel need is lower, and so a household switching

167
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:22,900
from a three-stone fire to an improved cookstove is estimated to eliminate between one and

168
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,980
a half and four tons of carbon emissions per year.

169
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,660
This is a hefty amount—roughly equivalent to the average annual carbon footprint of

170
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,540
a whole person in one of these households, or to flying between New York and Singapore

171
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,820
five times.

172
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,780
So, replacing these with these would go a long way to reducing emissions, but the problem

173
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,200
is that improved cookstoves are expensive.

174
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,960
Their 1,400-rupee cost is equivalent to a week of income for the average Coppola district

175
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,960
resident.

176
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:54,680
However, 1,400-rupee is only 18 American dollars—a miniscule amount to pay to offset such an

177
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,840
amount of flying, for example.

178
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,800
Therefore, cookstove replacement was a prime candidate for financing through carbon credits—a

179
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,760
perfect solution where certain individuals value an action above its cost simply for

180
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,600
its environmental benefits.

181
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,660
On top of that, the math was simpler—the higher the thermal efficiency, the lower the

182
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,160
emissions should be.

183
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,680
Having identified that, NGOs globally started distributing improved cookstoves to households

184
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,260
reliant on the three-stone fire, including in the Coppola district, where 43,000 stoves

185
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,320
were distributed to 21,500 families in exchange for the organizers selling 43,215 tons of

186
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,960
carbon offsets per year for a decade.

187
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,600
Now, what takes the system of cookstove replacement carbon offsetting from theoretically good

188
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,840
to great is its myriad co-benefits—the advantages stretch beyond just environmental.

189
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,040
To start with, gathering those huge quantities of wood to fuel traditional stoves takes time—an

190
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,580
average of 18 hours a week, in fact.

191
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,400
Researchers have found that overwhelmingly, the task of gathering wood for cooking is

192
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,280
left to women and girls, and it takes time that would often otherwise be spent on education,

193
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
for example.

194
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,520
Therefore, the use of improved cookstoves, which require an average of only five hours

195
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,840
of wood gathering per week, could help close the education gender gap observed in many

196
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,380
poorer regions.

197
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,820
On top of that, cooking is typically completed inside one's house, so the smoke inhaled

198
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,640
by users of traditional cookstoves is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.

199
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,920
Improved cookstoves do not eliminate smoke, but they do lessen it, so their distribution

200
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,220
works to eliminate some of the 4.3 million annual premature deaths attributable to household

201
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,720
air pollution.

202
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,960
Improved cookstove programs can also create local jobs manufacturing and maintaining stoves,

203
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:42,140
they can reduce unsustainable local deforestation—the co-benefits stretch on and on, and so it's

204
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,480
no wonder why, in the face of compounding stories of disastrously ineffective forest

205
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,800
protection programs, cookstove replacement was heralded by everyone from the United Nations

206
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,160
to Hillary Clinton as the next big innovation in carbon offsetting.

207
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,040
The math was simpler, the additionality was indisputable, the co-benefits were myriad,

208
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,540
and the costs were low.

209
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,120
These programs had the potential to finally offer carbon-conscious companies and consumers

210
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:12,180
a truly verifiable way to actually offset their impact on the world, so long as theory

211
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,640
translated into reality.

212
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,900
To test their program's effectiveness, researchers put hundreds of households in the Coppola

213
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,160
district into a test group—half were given the improved cookstoves immediately, and half

214
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,660
had to wait a year to act as the control group.

215
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,480
The researchers then tracked the various households' wood consumption to see how well it lined

216
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,200
up with the predicted decline.

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,300
With stoves increasing from 10 to 30% thermal efficiency, offsets were sold based on a theoretical

218
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,420
67% reduction in wood consumption.

219
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,940
What the researchers found was that when actually used on the ground in the Coppola district,

220
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,140
the improved cookstove households averaged 7.9 pounds or 3.6 kilograms in daily wood

221
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
consumption.

222
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:56,760
However, crucially, the control group used 9.3 pounds or 4.2 kilograms.

223
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,080
Improved cookstoves only led to a 15% decline in wood consumption.

224
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,540
So little that it couldn't even be considered statistically significant by the study.

225
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:11,780
That's to say, according to these results, hundreds of thousands of faulty carbon credits

226
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,260
were sold to individuals and companies who believed they were genuinely eliminating carbon

227
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,940
from the atmosphere—individuals who paid a premium over the forest protection alternative

228
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,900
to finance the purportedly more effective form of carbon offsetting.

229
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,800
What happened on the ground is that individuals' actions didn't conform to the optimistic

230
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,440
beliefs of the program's designers.

231
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,460
Almost half of the subject households didn't exclusively use the improved cookstoves—they

232
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,620
kept using their three-stone fires simultaneously.

233
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,980
This is a phenomenon so common that it has a dedicated term, stove stacking, and a whole

234
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,620
subset of research into its causes.

235
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,800
Broadly, stove stackers say they do so because it saves time—the more burners, the better.

236
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,100
That means that the main solution to stove stacking is giving each household more stoves,

237
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,160
but less carbon is going to be offset by the third stove as opposed to the first, given

238
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,400
less frequent use, so achieving the more verifiable version of a cookstove replacement program

239
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,120
comes with additional cost per ton offset.

240
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,480
Another core co-benefit of improved cookstoves is that they make cooking easier, but unsurprisingly,

241
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:17,120
making cooking easier often means people cook more.

242
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,440
There is almost always suppressed demand among traditional cookstove users, and so this makes

243
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,600
accounting for the carbon saved by the switch all the more difficult.

244
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,460
Given this difficulty, not all programs confront real-world conditions in their design.

245
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:35,100
United Nations Clean Development Mechanism-certified cookstove replacement programs are not required

246
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,180
to test the stoves and the extent of their fuel savings in the field.

247
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,640
Program designers can base their math off laboratory tests, the tests that led to the

248
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,260
failed assumptions of the Köpple district program, such as measuring how much wood is

249
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,420
necessary with each stove type to boil a given unit of water.

250
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,200
Current independent certifiers, such as the Gold Standard, require real-world kitchen

251
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,640
performance tests, measuring actual wood consumption in the actual project location by actual users

252
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,880
over a span of days, but not all experts agree that the more stringent path is the correct

253
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
one.

254
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,920
Water boiling tests are quick, cheap, and easy.

255
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,060
Kitchen performance tests are slow, expensive, and complicated.

256
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,020
That cost has to be passed on to the ultimate purchaser of carbon credits, and so this opens

257
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,820
up a broader, more subjective question.

258
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,980
Is it really worth it to increase cost, to increase accuracy?

259
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,540
Many cookstove replacement programs, including those based on less-precise water boiling

260
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,940
tests, are genuinely effective, but more of the kitchen performance test-based versions

261
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,120
are effective.

262
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,920
So, is it worth increasing cost?

263
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,680
Is it worth risking fewer carbon credits sold to be more confident that those credits are

264
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,520
actually effective?

265
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,600
Right now, the market seems to say no.

266
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,060
The least accurate type of carbon offsetting programs, forest protection programs, are

267
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:57,380
generally the lowest cost and hold a majority of the carbon offsetting market.

268
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,020
Meanwhile, the theoretically most accurate type of carbon offsetting, direct air capture,

269
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:06,780
where complex machinery literally sucks carbon out of the air, is the most expensive and

270
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,900
barely exists at commercial scale.

271
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,420
Consumers in the carbon market are making their purchasing decisions as they always

272
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
do.

273
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,220
If it costs $10 to offset a ton of carbon through one program and $15 through another,

274
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,240
why would they pick the latter?

275
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,200
The public overwhelmingly has neither the ability nor the desire to analyze the particulars

276
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,220
of individual carbon offsetting programs, so the cheapest option presented to them almost

277
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,440
always wins.

278
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,560
But that cheapest option is the one with the greatest uncertainty over whether it will

279
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
actually work.

280
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,260
It's the one with the greatest potential for the numbers to be fudged by nefarious

281
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,520
players looking to turn a profit.

282
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,560
All the stories are about projects where the carbon offset was overstated.

283
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,880
None are about carbon offset being understated.

284
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,160
If people are given the opportunity to turn a profit by fudging the numbers, people are

285
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,340
going to turn a profit by fudging the numbers.

286
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,620
Not only is the market enabling this action, it's incentivizing it by funneling the vast

287
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,340
majority of money into the cheapest, least verifiable, most exploitable projects.

288
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,400
And this isn't one of those situations where perfect is the enemy of good.

289
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,500
Carbon offsets are a form of syntax.

290
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,240
Individuals and companies buy them to alleviate the cognitive dissonance that stems from doing

291
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,880
something that accelerates climate change.

292
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,020
Therefore, if a person decides to take that transatlantic flight because they can negate

293
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:31,240
their emissions concerns simply by checking the offset box at checkout, that offset has

294
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,000
to be 100% effective to not do harm.

295
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,880
If that offset is just 90% effective, if the offsetting potential is just slightly overstated,

296
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,800
if families cook just slightly more than expected due to the convenience of their new

297
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:50,240
and improved cookstoves, the environment is in a worse place than where it started due

298
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,280
to carbon offsets.

299
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,040
Any behavioral economist would agree that carbon offsetting does lead to at least some

300
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,800
individuals or companies omitting more than they would if it wasn't an option, so this

301
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,760
scenario is not a fantasy.

302
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,760
Therefore, carbon offsetting, a practice presented as an innovative solution to the world's

303
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,720
carbon problem, has an extremely high risk of actually raising emissions.

304
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,080
Whether it does that is an entirely different, unanswerable question.

305
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,160
Given the complexity of just accounting for the carbon offset by an individual program,

306
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,840
entering that industry-wide would be entirely impossible, but the potential is there.

307
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,520
It's not that every carbon offset program is a scam.

308
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,800
There are plenty of extremely well-managed programs run by people genuinely trying to

309
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:43,440
make the world better that have truly verifiable offsetting impact and truly advantageous co-benefits.

310
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,000
Carbon can be truly offset, but that's not what the market incentivizes.

311
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,240
The market incentivizes the scam.

312
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,120
The market incentivizes a race to the bottom.

313
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,600
The market incentivizes the scenario where carbon offsetting, as a cohesive phenomenon,

314
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,240
has genuine potential to accelerate our march towards climate catastrophe.

315
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,440
If you've made it to the end of this video, you've clearly realized that, believe it

316
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,540
or not, talking climate policy can actually be interesting.

317
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,520
The world is changing faster than ever, and as catastrophic as that is, it's also fascinating

318
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,400
to watch unfold in real time.

319
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,820
I've certainly realized that over the years, especially as I produce two documentaries

320
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,560
about the subject—one profiling the Marshall Islands, the country that's expected to

321
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,120
be the first to become uninhabitable due to sea level rise, and another looking at

322
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
the Colorado River, the primary water source for the American Southwest, which uses more

323
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,600
water than the environment provides each year, putting the region on the path towards an

324
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,800
imminent water shortage disaster.

325
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,880
Each of these projects was produced on location with a rather big budget thanks to the funding

326
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
provided by Nebula, and by extension, all the Nebula viewers, so you can watch both

327
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,380
of these over there.

328
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,080
Of course, Nebula is the streaming site that I and a bunch of other smart creators started

329
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,960
to act as the best possible home to the stuff we make.

330
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,880
We post our regular videos over there early and ad-free, exclusive videos we call Nebula

331
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,620
Plus, and high-budget Nebula originals.

332
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,800
We also release videos from our new channel, Jetlag the Game, an entire week early on Nebula.

333
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Most of the channels with the highest audience overlap with Wendover are also on the platform,

334
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,640
so chances are you already watch plenty of Nebula creators.

335
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,520
But what makes this the best deal in streaming is that you can get two streaming sites for

336
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
less than the price of one.

337
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,720
Signing up via CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover bundles the two platforms together for just

338
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,900
$14.79 a year with the current sale price, and of course that also means you get access

339
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,360
to all of CuriosityStream's great library of non-fiction shows and documentaries, like

340
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,840
