0	4760	This is Virginia, this is Fredericksburg, and this is Plank Road.
4760	9360	It's the kind of road that forms where interstates output their trucks and cars—peppered with
9360	14520	gas stations, fast food chains, mid-market hotels, big box stores, and ample parking
14520	15520	for all.
15520	18220	If you've traveled the US, you certainly know the type.
18220	21940	The convenience of quick interstate access, the space for car-centric design, and the
21940	26120	co-location with other establishments has drawn retail and restaurants away from city
26120	33160	centers and into the hinterlands, so, increasingly, for all but the most urban or most rural Americans,
33160	37840	these interstate exit areas have become a constant in daily life.
37840	42960	In fact, places like Fredericksburg's Plank Road have become so ubiquitous, so persistent
42960	48320	in the US, that it'd be remarkably easy to miss that this is not actually Plank Road
48320	50420	in Fredericksburg, Virginia.
50420	51420	That was a lie.
51420	54760	In fact, not only are none of these clips from Virginia, they're not even from the
54760	56080	same location.
56080	60660	This is Portland, Maine, this is Cookeville, Tennessee, Marietta, Georgia, El Paso, Texas,
60660	62560	and Los Angeles, California.
62560	67960	These interstate exit streets have a style—one that's consistent across the 50 states.
67960	72400	It's so intuitive to today's Americans that when we see the golden arches approaching,
72400	76960	we know we just need to take the coming exit and follow the road straight until arrival—nothing
76960	79360	complicated like burdensome turns.
79360	83240	Upon arrival to the subject McDonald's, we know where to look for the bathroom—it's
83240	86240	typically towards the back, next to the side entry door.
86240	90800	The same can be said for roadside hotels, for gas stations, and for big box stores—we
90800	96080	might not realize it, but before even stepping in, thanks to nationwide standardization,
96080	101440	we have an intuitive understanding of where the bathroom or register is.
101440	105100	The US is a fantastically inconsistent country.
105100	109560	The degree of difference between the landscapes of Utah and Maine, or Florida and Alaska,
109560	113080	is one typically reserved for continents, not countries.
113080	117940	The people of New York City and North Dakota live enormously different lives—a given
117940	121320	day in Minot looks nothing like that in Manhattan.
121320	126520	A defining characteristic of this country is its heterogeneity, and yet, the places
126520	132520	in which its people live, the cities and towns they've constructed, are eerily similar.
132520	136160	Anchorage could be in Alabama, and Columbus could be in California.
136160	142140	Simply put, outside of the oldest areas, the way in which urban America is being built
142140	146620	is exceptionally homogeneous.
146620	148000	Consider these.
148000	152580	If one type of building has come to define the increasing sameness of urban and suburban
152580	154660	America, it's the 5 over 1.
154660	159060	While they're never the exact same, they do look similar.
159060	163260	With punchy names like the Union or Uncommon, and advertisements prompting a sense of community
163260	166820	and trendy amenities, they feel similar, too.
166820	171780	Their 5 over 1 moniker stems from their building code designation—structurally, they're
171820	177540	a wooden, Type 5 fire-resistant building sitting atop a Type 1 base floor of concrete.
177540	182060	Dotting the edges of downtowns and dominating new developments, these mid-rises teeming
182060	186460	with young professionals are big, pushing up to the very edge of sidewalks, they're
186460	191020	blocky, an unrelenting assemblage of 90-degree angles, and they're popping up everywhere
191020	192960	from Maine to Montana.
192960	197780	In the past, apartments were small, looking not so different from a large house, or they
197780	202180	were massive—steel and concrete structures that scraped the sky.
202180	206680	Nowadays, when you conjure up an apartment building in your head, it looks like this.
206680	211540	And just how these boxy, boring, but important structures came to define the current apartment
211540	217020	building boom comes from a surprisingly specific few lines of building code.
217020	221140	In the US, building codes are each municipality's choice.
221140	225260	The rules and standards by which a city is built can vary from town to town in relation
225260	227740	to what exactly a town wants.
227740	231260	And yet, building codes in the US rarely differ.
231260	235620	A town of 500 just doesn't have the time or resources to write their own comprehensive
235620	240260	thousand-page building code, so they typically just adopt this one—the International Building
240260	241260	Code.
241260	245380	Originally written within living memory of the Great Chicago Fire, these codes, on account
245380	249100	of fire prevention, limited wood buildings to three stories.
249100	253820	While floor limits eased to five over the decades, codes into the 1990s required walls
253820	258380	built out of non-combustible material, hampering the cost advantage of wood-framed apartment
258380	259380	buildings.
259380	264660	But then the code added an exception—that exterior and interior walls built with flame-retardant-treated
264660	267620	wood could be considered non-combustible.
267620	272380	As the story goes, an LA architect, Tim Smith, caught the change, identified his potential
272380	278700	as a cheap alternative to steel and concrete, and built the first ever five over one.
278700	281260	Building codes made these structures possible.
281860	284820	They didn't, however, make them profitable.
284820	287800	That was the work of American zoning practices.
287800	292820	The rise of boxy, balloon-framed housing cubes is the result of just how much urban and suburban
292820	298180	land is zoned for single-family homes—around three-fourths of all residential land in the
298180	299180	US.
299180	303860	In the western states, with generally younger and more sprawling urban areas, these numbers
303860	305300	trend higher.
305300	306780	Take Fort Collins, for example.
306780	310740	Fort Collins is a college town of over 100,000 north of Denver.
311220	314820	It's a place with a perpetual need for housing to keep up with an increasing student body
314820	319880	and a growing city population, yet, despite the flat plains of seemingly developable land
319880	324740	that surround it, it really has no room for dense housing projects.
324740	330900	All this is zoned for low-density single-family homes and duplexes—this, too.
330900	334820	This is downtown where apartment buildings are fair game, but Fort Collins is relatively
334820	337780	old so much of downtown is already accounted for.
337780	341920	This area next to downtown is old, too, so it's zoned to protect the historic neighborhood
341920	343940	and is largely off limits.
343940	348360	All this is commercially zoned, so apartments are allowed there, but it's on a state highway,
348360	352280	so any housing project will have to compete with businesses for the prime real estate.
352280	356140	With so much of the town accounted for, this is the result.
356140	360500	Five over ones cluster in the tiny area around campus zoned for high-density housing, while
360500	364740	the rest randomly pop up on the edge of downtown or just off the highway.
364740	367620	This pattern is not unique to Fort Collins.
367620	372260	While housing is desperately needed nationwide, so much land has been ceded to detached family
372260	376820	homes, cul-de-sacs, and white picket fences that high-density housing is left to fight
376820	381660	over the scraps—maximizing the amount of units they squeeze onto pricey plots and competing
381660	386660	with retail and office developers over highway exits and the fringes of downtowns and industrial
386660	387660	areas.
387660	391220	Of course, what makes these five over ones look like they're all built by the same
391220	395700	people is the fact that they're all built by the same people.
395700	403260	Of the 293,000 large building housing units developed in 2019, 94,000, a third, were constructed
403260	405900	by the country's 25 largest developers.
405900	411220	Over the past decade, the US multifamily housing market has fallen into a vicious cycle of
411220	415700	consolidation leading to consolidation leading to consolidation.
415700	420460	To start, the limited availability of multifamily zoned land drives up its price, meaning a
420460	423300	smaller tranche of developers can afford it.
423300	427540	Not only that, but an even smaller tranche of developers can afford to develop that land
427540	432580	into a project large and dense enough to attain profitability given the higher purchase price.
432580	437780	Simultaneously, however, these large developers enjoy economies of scale with these large
437780	438780	buildings.
438780	442740	They're able to build equivalent apartments for less thanks to more shared walls, elevators,
442740	444340	mechanicals, management, and more.
444340	448580	And of course, thanks to American building codes, deeper pockets, and an inherent need
448580	452900	to build bigger on more expensive lots, they're able to do what smaller developers cannot
452900	457780	and further reduce per-unit costs by maxing out the lot lines with 5 over 1s.
457780	463120	On a per-unit basis, 5 over 1s are cheaper to build—wood is far less expensive than
463120	464300	alternate materials.
464300	469060	It's easier to work with, too, driving down labor costs and minimizing the use of unionized
469060	470060	trayspeople.
470060	474060	Therefore, these buildings outcompete smaller buildings in the market, the developers grow
474060	477740	wealthier, and with that wealth they're able to expand across state lines.
477740	482980	And of course, the process becomes even cheaper when they recycle plans, shuffle specialized
482980	487640	staff across the country, and apply these same proven strategies to different markets.
487640	491260	From the pool deck, Greystar Real Estate's Ayla building doesn't look so different
491260	496300	from their Canvas on Blake development, despite two time zones separating them, but in today's
496300	498820	housing market, this is hardly surprising.
498820	504740	Now, on the surface, these 5 over 1s appear to address a major need in the American housing
504740	510180	market—walkable, reasonably priced multifamily rental units in and around urban cores.
510180	515060	However, the consolidation behind these buildings has accelerated the propagation of another
515060	517820	can of worms—the corporate landlord.
517820	523400	Now, these 5 over 1 developments are almost always constructed as rental buildings, yet
523400	525860	rarely act as affordable housing.
525860	530260	In Denver, for example, the rent for the cheapest units at the Broadstone on 9th, Canvas on
530260	534940	Blake or 20th Street Station buildings either meets or exceeds the city average.
534940	540180	Rather, these apartments succeed because they out-compete their closest mid-market competitors.
540180	545020	You typically just can't get a new, modern, walkable apartment in smaller boutique or
545020	547820	massive older developments for a similar price.
547820	552700	Therefore, 5 over 1s and these massive developers have cornered an underserved segment of the
552700	556580	housing market, and that means they can get away with a lot.
556580	561100	Countless examples have emerged of the difficulty of having a corporation as a landlord.
561100	565720	San Francisco renters, in a building where a one-bedroom went for $2,800 a month, recounted
565720	569840	how Graystar increased rents and fees, while cutting staffing and services to the point
569840	573700	that trash piled up in hallways, and neighbors had to borrow one another's showers when
573700	576140	building boilers went out of service.
576140	581340	Now, looking at 2020 census data, the US is building more multifamily housing than it
581340	586340	has at any point this century, and while the data don't directly tell us how many of
586340	591740	these are 5 over 1s, when looking at building material, style, and size characteristics,
591740	596820	it becomes clear that 5 over 1s and buildings like them make up the vast majority of these
596820	598280	new builds.
598280	602580	Of course, in the face of dramatic housing shortages, this should be a good thing, but
602580	607700	the reality is that 5 over 1s are not built to house those most acutely feeling the effects
607700	608700	of these shortages.
608700	612260	While there is an argument to be made that their construction frees up units for those
612260	618800	who might otherwise have been displaced, that clearly comes at a less than ideal cost.
618800	624000	Across America, plenty more places and circumstances have converged to create the ideal environments
624000	625440	for homogeneity.
625440	630700	Within those ubiquitous interstate exit roadways, there is a common landscape of Hampton, Holiday,
630700	632420	and La Quinta Inns.
632420	637220	Rarely are these areas punctuated by independent hotels—it's almost always the same selection
637220	642820	of nationwide brands—and when walking into, say, the Sleep Inn in Chiloquin, Oregon, you'd
642820	644940	be forgiven for thinking it looks familiar.
644940	651740	That's because the exact same hotel exists, down to the inch, 1,500 miles or 2,500 kilometers
651740	654020	away in Webb City, Missouri.
654020	659260	Of course, this is all part of the business model—in fact, it's the genius of the
659260	660260	business model.
660260	664760	You see, Sleep Inn is a brand owned by Choice Hotels International—one of the largest
664760	668480	hotel chains in the world, running some 7,000 properties globally.
668480	671920	However, the company doesn't own these hotels—only the brands.
671920	675980	That's because they're a franchisor, just like McDonald's or Burger King.
675980	679780	An independent franchisee comes to Choice when they want to start a hotel, and the company
679780	684200	provides a menu of brands to choose from, each targeting a slightly different segment
684200	685200	of consumers.
685200	689700	Then, the franchisee must decide what floor plan they want, whether to include a pool,
689700	692120	and which of the four color schemes to use.
692120	696500	They then sign a contract with one of the Choice Hotels approved contractors for construction,
696500	699560	write some checks, and that's about it.
699560	705040	The franchise model cuts huge chunks, and therefore costs, out of the process—designing
705040	709480	the building, adapting the design in response to permitting issues, vetting contractors,
709480	711280	figuring out how to manage a hotel.
711280	716300	It allows anyone to become a hotelier, which is exactly what Choice Hotels wants because,
716300	721080	as long as it's anyone but them, the financial constraint and risk is gone.
721080	725200	On the consumer side, whether it's a road-tripper pulling into the parking lot after dark, a
725200	729380	pilot stopping for their ten hours of mandated rest, or a consultant hitting their sick city
729380	735040	in a month, uniqueness often has little value—in fact, it might be a negative for the weary
735040	738540	traveler compared to a standardized, familiar offering.
738540	742280	The market speaks for itself, and so does the market research.
742280	746840	Independent hotels are no longer truly able to compete in this mid-market sector—they
746840	751080	now focus on the higher end of the spectrum, where the hotel is more of a destination than
751080	752080	a waypoint.
752080	758000	So, in the hotel sector, this standardization stems from the cost savings born out of homogeneity,
758000	761020	and the consumer apathy towards its detriments.
761020	763600	These conditions have created this.
763600	768600	Comfort Suites, Hampton Inn, Burger King, Best Western, Shoney's, Quality Inn, Dunkin'
768600	773680	Donuts, America's Best Value Inn, and Marathon Gas are all franchises.
773680	777880	Every single business here is built on the principles of standardization, and this is
777880	780980	hardly a cherry-picked example.
780980	786740	Across America, 57% of limited-service restaurants operate as part of a franchise, and this proportion
786740	791800	tends to rise in step with the state's poverty rate—while it's only 31 and 38% in New
791800	797880	York and Massachusetts, respectively, it's as much as 71 and 78% in West Virginia and
797880	798880	Mississippi.
798880	803280	But the economic and social forces supporting sameness are not restricted to the working
803280	807080	and middle class—they're not even restricted to the US.
807080	812800	These are four major business districts in Sydney, Santiago, London, and Frankfurt.
812800	816860	Without first-hand knowledge of the intricacies of their skylines, it'd be tough to differentiate
816860	819600	which is where, and there's a good reason for this.
819600	824000	For all intents and purposes, these are the same places.
824000	828600	These are ten major multinational businesses either directly in or tangentially related
828600	829760	to the finance sector.
829760	835440	Out of a whole city of options, nine are located in London's compact Canary Wharf
835440	836440	neighborhood.
836440	841400	Meanwhile, in Frankfurt's Bencken-Wirttel neighborhood, eight of the same companies.
841400	846560	Across the Atlantic, 7,500 miles or 12,000 kilometers away in Santiago's San Hatton
846560	851360	neighborhood, nine of the same companies—all located within a few blocks of each other.
851360	855980	Then, finally, across an equally sized stretch of the Pacific, there's Sydney's central
855980	860480	business district, home to all ten of these multinational companies.
860480	864740	These areas and urban cores are often home to the most evocative buildings in a city's
864740	868620	skyline, but these buildings are typically used by people whose preferences are standardized
868620	869860	on a global scale.
869860	873900	On a micro-level, that's because people often move between these business districts
873900	877820	as they move within their companies, and of course, on a macro-level because it's the
877820	881980	exact same companies signing the leases for these buildings globally.
881980	886940	They want the same thing, whether it's in Sydney, Santiago, London, or Frankfurt.
886940	891860	This all starts to point towards a cause broader than building codes, franchising, or the international
891860	894740	flows within multinational companies.
894740	897820	The world encourages sameness.
897820	903860	No matter who we are or where we go, we sometimes just want to be able to get quick, decent,
903860	905800	cheap, warm food.
905800	909740	When we just finished a double shift or woke up early for a 6am flight, we don't want
909740	913380	to have to comb through a menu we've never seen to eat something that we might like or
913380	914680	might hate.
914680	918340	We want what fast food provides—we want to be able to get the same burger in a few
918340	921820	minutes no matter where on earth we find ourselves.
921820	924580	Fast food provides consistent mediocrity.
924580	928420	We might not always want this, but when we're eating just for the sake of eating, that can
928420	930060	be a feature.
930060	934340	The wants and needs of humans were no different a century or two ago.
934340	938400	McDonald's would have been just as successful in the 1800s if it existed.
938400	941360	What has changed, however, is the world.
941360	945800	Devoid of jet airplanes and internet access, it would have been impossible to run a chain
945800	948260	of cheap restaurants spanning the globe.
948260	953320	Not only that, but you can't grow tomatoes in Norway—it's too cold.
953320	957960	Therefore, lacking the long-distance, cold-chain supply lines of today, there was no way to
957960	962760	get the tomato necessary to make the same burger in Norway as in California.
962760	966000	Local conditions dictated what was possible locally.
966000	968320	That's no longer the case.
968320	970780	What happened next is globalization.
970780	973340	The walls came down.
973340	977840	With cargo ships, airplanes, and internet cables linking each country to the next, getting
977840	982080	that tomato anywhere and then instructing the local staff on how to cut it is hardly
982080	983440	a challenge anymore.
983440	986080	The forces encouraging difference disappeared.
986080	991620	What's left is economies of scale, is consumer preference for consistency, is the effectiveness
991620	996380	of branding, is the creeping consolidation of capital—what's left, in a world devoid
996380	1000100	of walls, is the pervasive power of sameness.
1000100	1006300	Now, it's this exact power that has yielded plenty of the advances of the modern age.
1006300	1011660	It's for these exact reasons why the standard of living of the average person has never
1011660	1012840	been higher.
1012840	1017660	If we still had to build houses in the timber-scarce American Southwest out of adobe bricks, it'd
1017660	1020540	hardly be the fastest-growing region in the country.
1020540	1024500	Nowadays, timber prices barely differ whether you're at a Lowe's bordering the forest
1024500	1028140	in Oregon or a Lowe's in the middle of the desert in Arizona.
1028140	1032420	In an environment devoid of difference, it's just as effective to build those five-over-ones
1032420	1034820	in Arizona or Oregon.
1034820	1037300	So, is this a problem?
1037300	1040580	If there's an objectively best option for addressing the country's crippling need
1040580	1043460	for more multifamily housing, should it be avoided?
1043460	1048220	If a national chain of hotels is able to offer consistent, decent rooms at a lower cost than
1048220	1050220	competitors, is that a bad thing?
1050220	1054480	If there's simply a style of skyscraper that those who use the skyscrapers want most,
1054480	1056080	are they at fault?
1056080	1062440	Well, consistency should be recognized for what it is—a convenience with a cost.
1062440	1067100	The difficulty is that the convenience and the cost are experienced by different parties.
1067100	1071500	When that roadside hotel in Chiloquin, Oregon uses the exact same floor plan as its equivalent
1071500	1076120	in Webb City, Missouri, the majority of the benefit is experienced by the owners who are
1076120	1079400	able to set up an equally profitable business or less.
1079400	1084180	Meanwhile, the majority of the cost is experienced by those living in Chiloquin, who experience
1084180	1088620	the built-up environment of an area as unique as Oregon's Endless Wilderness adapted
1088620	1091860	into the epitome of any town USA.
1091860	1096820	The creeping sameness of the modern world is not a big problem—rather, it's a series
1096820	1102820	of small problems that are experienced again and again and again by everyone—but just
1102820	1107140	because a problem is small, and just because a problem relates to far bigger ones, it's
1107140	1108740	still a problem.
1108740	1114000	Solutions respond to their environment, and humans are part of the urban environment.
1114000	1119100	If priorities change, the environment changes, and so will the solutions.
1119100	1124040	As of yet, few seem exceptionally concerned—no surprise in the country that's now been
1124040	1128720	building cookie-cutter suburban developments for decades—but we don't have to be content
1128720	1131760	with reality just because it's happening.
1131760	1135560	So, consider what a common development style does to cities.
1135560	1139940	Consider whether we want the same dining options in every town, big or small.
1139940	1142840	Consider the sameness.
1142840	1147080	This is the first ever video I posted on this channel, and as you can see here, it has stock
1147080	1148160	footage.
1148160	1151640	That stock footage, and a huge chunk of the footage we've used since then, came from
1151640	1156280	the provider I've used ever since, and who's actually today's sponsor, Storyblocks.
1156280	1160160	Most stock footage providers charge per clip, sometimes in the hundreds of dollars, which
1160160	1163640	really just doesn't work with the economics of digital video.
1163640	1167620	Storyblocks, however, offers an unlimited download subscription for less than what the
1167620	1171780	other providers charge for one clip, and with that you get access to their huge catalog
1171780	1177000	of footage for your videos, your posts, your presentation, anything you do online.
1177000	1181300	Not only that, but Storyblocks also offers stock images, music, audio, After Effects
1181300	1183180	and Premiere templates, and more.
1183180	1186760	The reason we've been using Storyblocks for years, long before they sponsored us,
1186760	1189860	is because they are the one-stop-shop for digital creation.
1189860	1193920	I don't think I know a single full-time creator that doesn't have a subscription
1193920	1194920	to them.
1194920	1198700	So, if you make anything online, it's worth checking them out—subscribing could be one
1198700	1201320	of the best investments you ever make in your content.
1201320	1205760	Click the button on screen or head to Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be
1205760	1208040	supporting Wendover while you're at it.
