00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
This is Virginia, this is Fredericksburg, and this is Plank Road.

00:04.760 --> 00:09.360
It's the kind of road that forms where interstates output their trucks and cars—peppered with

00:09.360 --> 00:14.520
gas stations, fast food chains, mid-market hotels, big box stores, and ample parking

00:14.520 --> 00:15.520
for all.

00:15.520 --> 00:18.220
If you've traveled the US, you certainly know the type.

00:18.220 --> 00:21.940
The convenience of quick interstate access, the space for car-centric design, and the

00:21.940 --> 00:26.120
co-location with other establishments has drawn retail and restaurants away from city

00:26.120 --> 00:33.160
centers and into the hinterlands, so, increasingly, for all but the most urban or most rural Americans,

00:33.160 --> 00:37.840
these interstate exit areas have become a constant in daily life.

00:37.840 --> 00:42.960
In fact, places like Fredericksburg's Plank Road have become so ubiquitous, so persistent

00:42.960 --> 00:48.320
in the US, that it'd be remarkably easy to miss that this is not actually Plank Road

00:48.320 --> 00:50.420
in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

00:50.420 --> 00:51.420
That was a lie.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.760
In fact, not only are none of these clips from Virginia, they're not even from the

00:54.760 --> 00:56.080
same location.

00:56.080 --> 01:00.660
This is Portland, Maine, this is Cookeville, Tennessee, Marietta, Georgia, El Paso, Texas,

01:00.660 --> 01:02.560
and Los Angeles, California.

01:02.560 --> 01:07.960
These interstate exit streets have a style—one that's consistent across the 50 states.

01:07.960 --> 01:12.400
It's so intuitive to today's Americans that when we see the golden arches approaching,

01:12.400 --> 01:16.960
we know we just need to take the coming exit and follow the road straight until arrival—nothing

01:16.960 --> 01:19.360
complicated like burdensome turns.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.240
Upon arrival to the subject McDonald's, we know where to look for the bathroom—it's

01:23.240 --> 01:26.240
typically towards the back, next to the side entry door.

01:26.240 --> 01:30.800
The same can be said for roadside hotels, for gas stations, and for big box stores—we

01:30.800 --> 01:36.080
might not realize it, but before even stepping in, thanks to nationwide standardization,

01:36.080 --> 01:41.440
we have an intuitive understanding of where the bathroom or register is.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.100
The US is a fantastically inconsistent country.

01:45.100 --> 01:49.560
The degree of difference between the landscapes of Utah and Maine, or Florida and Alaska,

01:49.560 --> 01:53.080
is one typically reserved for continents, not countries.

01:53.080 --> 01:57.940
The people of New York City and North Dakota live enormously different lives—a given

01:57.940 --> 02:01.320
day in Minot looks nothing like that in Manhattan.

02:01.320 --> 02:06.520
A defining characteristic of this country is its heterogeneity, and yet, the places

02:06.520 --> 02:12.520
in which its people live, the cities and towns they've constructed, are eerily similar.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.160
Anchorage could be in Alabama, and Columbus could be in California.

02:16.160 --> 02:22.140
Simply put, outside of the oldest areas, the way in which urban America is being built

02:22.140 --> 02:26.620
is exceptionally homogeneous.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.000
Consider these.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.580
If one type of building has come to define the increasing sameness of urban and suburban

02:32.580 --> 02:34.660
America, it's the 5 over 1.

02:34.660 --> 02:39.060
While they're never the exact same, they do look similar.

02:39.060 --> 02:43.260
With punchy names like the Union or Uncommon, and advertisements prompting a sense of community

02:43.260 --> 02:46.820
and trendy amenities, they feel similar, too.

02:46.820 --> 02:51.780
Their 5 over 1 moniker stems from their building code designation—structurally, they're

02:51.820 --> 02:57.540
a wooden, Type 5 fire-resistant building sitting atop a Type 1 base floor of concrete.

02:57.540 --> 03:02.060
Dotting the edges of downtowns and dominating new developments, these mid-rises teeming

03:02.060 --> 03:06.460
with young professionals are big, pushing up to the very edge of sidewalks, they're

03:06.460 --> 03:11.020
blocky, an unrelenting assemblage of 90-degree angles, and they're popping up everywhere

03:11.020 --> 03:12.960
from Maine to Montana.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.780
In the past, apartments were small, looking not so different from a large house, or they

03:17.780 --> 03:22.180
were massive—steel and concrete structures that scraped the sky.

03:22.180 --> 03:26.680
Nowadays, when you conjure up an apartment building in your head, it looks like this.

03:26.680 --> 03:31.540
And just how these boxy, boring, but important structures came to define the current apartment

03:31.540 --> 03:37.020
building boom comes from a surprisingly specific few lines of building code.

03:37.020 --> 03:41.140
In the US, building codes are each municipality's choice.

03:41.140 --> 03:45.260
The rules and standards by which a city is built can vary from town to town in relation

03:45.260 --> 03:47.740
to what exactly a town wants.

03:47.740 --> 03:51.260
And yet, building codes in the US rarely differ.

03:51.260 --> 03:55.620
A town of 500 just doesn't have the time or resources to write their own comprehensive

03:55.620 --> 04:00.260
thousand-page building code, so they typically just adopt this one—the International Building

04:00.260 --> 04:01.260
Code.

04:01.260 --> 04:05.380
Originally written within living memory of the Great Chicago Fire, these codes, on account

04:05.380 --> 04:09.100
of fire prevention, limited wood buildings to three stories.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.820
While floor limits eased to five over the decades, codes into the 1990s required walls

04:13.820 --> 04:18.380
built out of non-combustible material, hampering the cost advantage of wood-framed apartment

04:18.380 --> 04:19.380
buildings.

04:19.380 --> 04:24.660
But then the code added an exception—that exterior and interior walls built with flame-retardant-treated

04:24.660 --> 04:27.620
wood could be considered non-combustible.

04:27.620 --> 04:32.380
As the story goes, an LA architect, Tim Smith, caught the change, identified his potential

04:32.380 --> 04:38.700
as a cheap alternative to steel and concrete, and built the first ever five over one.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.260
Building codes made these structures possible.

04:41.860 --> 04:44.820
They didn't, however, make them profitable.

04:44.820 --> 04:47.800
That was the work of American zoning practices.

04:47.800 --> 04:52.820
The rise of boxy, balloon-framed housing cubes is the result of just how much urban and suburban

04:52.820 --> 04:58.180
land is zoned for single-family homes—around three-fourths of all residential land in the

04:58.180 --> 04:59.180
US.

04:59.180 --> 05:03.860
In the western states, with generally younger and more sprawling urban areas, these numbers

05:03.860 --> 05:05.300
trend higher.

05:05.300 --> 05:06.780
Take Fort Collins, for example.

05:06.780 --> 05:10.740
Fort Collins is a college town of over 100,000 north of Denver.

05:11.220 --> 05:14.820
It's a place with a perpetual need for housing to keep up with an increasing student body

05:14.820 --> 05:19.880
and a growing city population, yet, despite the flat plains of seemingly developable land

05:19.880 --> 05:24.740
that surround it, it really has no room for dense housing projects.

05:24.740 --> 05:30.900
All this is zoned for low-density single-family homes and duplexes—this, too.

05:30.900 --> 05:34.820
This is downtown where apartment buildings are fair game, but Fort Collins is relatively

05:34.820 --> 05:37.780
old so much of downtown is already accounted for.

05:37.780 --> 05:41.920
This area next to downtown is old, too, so it's zoned to protect the historic neighborhood

05:41.920 --> 05:43.940
and is largely off limits.

05:43.940 --> 05:48.360
All this is commercially zoned, so apartments are allowed there, but it's on a state highway,

05:48.360 --> 05:52.280
so any housing project will have to compete with businesses for the prime real estate.

05:52.280 --> 05:56.140
With so much of the town accounted for, this is the result.

05:56.140 --> 06:00.500
Five over ones cluster in the tiny area around campus zoned for high-density housing, while

06:00.500 --> 06:04.740
the rest randomly pop up on the edge of downtown or just off the highway.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.620
This pattern is not unique to Fort Collins.

06:07.620 --> 06:12.260
While housing is desperately needed nationwide, so much land has been ceded to detached family

06:12.260 --> 06:16.820
homes, cul-de-sacs, and white picket fences that high-density housing is left to fight

06:16.820 --> 06:21.660
over the scraps—maximizing the amount of units they squeeze onto pricey plots and competing

06:21.660 --> 06:26.660
with retail and office developers over highway exits and the fringes of downtowns and industrial

06:26.660 --> 06:27.660
areas.

06:27.660 --> 06:31.220
Of course, what makes these five over ones look like they're all built by the same

06:31.220 --> 06:35.700
people is the fact that they're all built by the same people.

06:35.700 --> 06:43.260
Of the 293,000 large building housing units developed in 2019, 94,000, a third, were constructed

06:43.260 --> 06:45.900
by the country's 25 largest developers.

06:45.900 --> 06:51.220
Over the past decade, the US multifamily housing market has fallen into a vicious cycle of

06:51.220 --> 06:55.700
consolidation leading to consolidation leading to consolidation.

06:55.700 --> 07:00.460
To start, the limited availability of multifamily zoned land drives up its price, meaning a

07:00.460 --> 07:03.300
smaller tranche of developers can afford it.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.540
Not only that, but an even smaller tranche of developers can afford to develop that land

07:07.540 --> 07:12.580
into a project large and dense enough to attain profitability given the higher purchase price.

07:12.580 --> 07:17.780
Simultaneously, however, these large developers enjoy economies of scale with these large

07:17.780 --> 07:18.780
buildings.

07:18.780 --> 07:22.740
They're able to build equivalent apartments for less thanks to more shared walls, elevators,

07:22.740 --> 07:24.340
mechanicals, management, and more.

07:24.340 --> 07:28.580
And of course, thanks to American building codes, deeper pockets, and an inherent need

07:28.580 --> 07:32.900
to build bigger on more expensive lots, they're able to do what smaller developers cannot

07:32.900 --> 07:37.780
and further reduce per-unit costs by maxing out the lot lines with 5 over 1s.

07:37.780 --> 07:43.120
On a per-unit basis, 5 over 1s are cheaper to build—wood is far less expensive than

07:43.120 --> 07:44.300
alternate materials.

07:44.300 --> 07:49.060
It's easier to work with, too, driving down labor costs and minimizing the use of unionized

07:49.060 --> 07:50.060
trayspeople.

07:50.060 --> 07:54.060
Therefore, these buildings outcompete smaller buildings in the market, the developers grow

07:54.060 --> 07:57.740
wealthier, and with that wealth they're able to expand across state lines.

07:57.740 --> 08:02.980
And of course, the process becomes even cheaper when they recycle plans, shuffle specialized

08:02.980 --> 08:07.640
staff across the country, and apply these same proven strategies to different markets.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.260
From the pool deck, Greystar Real Estate's Ayla building doesn't look so different

08:11.260 --> 08:16.300
from their Canvas on Blake development, despite two time zones separating them, but in today's

08:16.300 --> 08:18.820
housing market, this is hardly surprising.

08:18.820 --> 08:24.740
Now, on the surface, these 5 over 1s appear to address a major need in the American housing

08:24.740 --> 08:30.180
market—walkable, reasonably priced multifamily rental units in and around urban cores.

08:30.180 --> 08:35.060
However, the consolidation behind these buildings has accelerated the propagation of another

08:35.060 --> 08:37.820
can of worms—the corporate landlord.

08:37.820 --> 08:43.400
Now, these 5 over 1 developments are almost always constructed as rental buildings, yet

08:43.400 --> 08:45.860
rarely act as affordable housing.

08:45.860 --> 08:50.260
In Denver, for example, the rent for the cheapest units at the Broadstone on 9th, Canvas on

08:50.260 --> 08:54.940
Blake or 20th Street Station buildings either meets or exceeds the city average.

08:54.940 --> 09:00.180
Rather, these apartments succeed because they out-compete their closest mid-market competitors.

09:00.180 --> 09:05.020
You typically just can't get a new, modern, walkable apartment in smaller boutique or

09:05.020 --> 09:07.820
massive older developments for a similar price.

09:07.820 --> 09:12.700
Therefore, 5 over 1s and these massive developers have cornered an underserved segment of the

09:12.700 --> 09:16.580
housing market, and that means they can get away with a lot.

09:16.580 --> 09:21.100
Countless examples have emerged of the difficulty of having a corporation as a landlord.

09:21.100 --> 09:25.720
San Francisco renters, in a building where a one-bedroom went for $2,800 a month, recounted

09:25.720 --> 09:29.840
how Graystar increased rents and fees, while cutting staffing and services to the point

09:29.840 --> 09:33.700
that trash piled up in hallways, and neighbors had to borrow one another's showers when

09:33.700 --> 09:36.140
building boilers went out of service.

09:36.140 --> 09:41.340
Now, looking at 2020 census data, the US is building more multifamily housing than it

09:41.340 --> 09:46.340
has at any point this century, and while the data don't directly tell us how many of

09:46.340 --> 09:51.740
these are 5 over 1s, when looking at building material, style, and size characteristics,

09:51.740 --> 09:56.820
it becomes clear that 5 over 1s and buildings like them make up the vast majority of these

09:56.820 --> 09:58.280
new builds.

09:58.280 --> 10:02.580
Of course, in the face of dramatic housing shortages, this should be a good thing, but

10:02.580 --> 10:07.700
the reality is that 5 over 1s are not built to house those most acutely feeling the effects

10:07.700 --> 10:08.700
of these shortages.

10:08.700 --> 10:12.260
While there is an argument to be made that their construction frees up units for those

10:12.260 --> 10:18.800
who might otherwise have been displaced, that clearly comes at a less than ideal cost.

10:18.800 --> 10:24.000
Across America, plenty more places and circumstances have converged to create the ideal environments

10:24.000 --> 10:25.440
for homogeneity.

10:25.440 --> 10:30.700
Within those ubiquitous interstate exit roadways, there is a common landscape of Hampton, Holiday,

10:30.700 --> 10:32.420
and La Quinta Inns.

10:32.420 --> 10:37.220
Rarely are these areas punctuated by independent hotels—it's almost always the same selection

10:37.220 --> 10:42.820
of nationwide brands—and when walking into, say, the Sleep Inn in Chiloquin, Oregon, you'd

10:42.820 --> 10:44.940
be forgiven for thinking it looks familiar.

10:44.940 --> 10:51.740
That's because the exact same hotel exists, down to the inch, 1,500 miles or 2,500 kilometers

10:51.740 --> 10:54.020
away in Webb City, Missouri.

10:54.020 --> 10:59.260
Of course, this is all part of the business model—in fact, it's the genius of the

10:59.260 --> 11:00.260
business model.

11:00.260 --> 11:04.760
You see, Sleep Inn is a brand owned by Choice Hotels International—one of the largest

11:04.760 --> 11:08.480
hotel chains in the world, running some 7,000 properties globally.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.920
However, the company doesn't own these hotels—only the brands.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.980
That's because they're a franchisor, just like McDonald's or Burger King.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.780
An independent franchisee comes to Choice when they want to start a hotel, and the company

11:19.780 --> 11:24.200
provides a menu of brands to choose from, each targeting a slightly different segment

11:24.200 --> 11:25.200
of consumers.

11:25.200 --> 11:29.700
Then, the franchisee must decide what floor plan they want, whether to include a pool,

11:29.700 --> 11:32.120
and which of the four color schemes to use.

11:32.120 --> 11:36.500
They then sign a contract with one of the Choice Hotels approved contractors for construction,

11:36.500 --> 11:39.560
write some checks, and that's about it.

11:39.560 --> 11:45.040
The franchise model cuts huge chunks, and therefore costs, out of the process—designing

11:45.040 --> 11:49.480
the building, adapting the design in response to permitting issues, vetting contractors,

11:49.480 --> 11:51.280
figuring out how to manage a hotel.

11:51.280 --> 11:56.300
It allows anyone to become a hotelier, which is exactly what Choice Hotels wants because,

11:56.300 --> 12:01.080
as long as it's anyone but them, the financial constraint and risk is gone.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.200
On the consumer side, whether it's a road-tripper pulling into the parking lot after dark, a

12:05.200 --> 12:09.380
pilot stopping for their ten hours of mandated rest, or a consultant hitting their sick city

12:09.380 --> 12:15.040
in a month, uniqueness often has little value—in fact, it might be a negative for the weary

12:15.040 --> 12:18.540
traveler compared to a standardized, familiar offering.

12:18.540 --> 12:22.280
The market speaks for itself, and so does the market research.

12:22.280 --> 12:26.840
Independent hotels are no longer truly able to compete in this mid-market sector—they

12:26.840 --> 12:31.080
now focus on the higher end of the spectrum, where the hotel is more of a destination than

12:31.080 --> 12:32.080
a waypoint.

12:32.080 --> 12:38.000
So, in the hotel sector, this standardization stems from the cost savings born out of homogeneity,

12:38.000 --> 12:41.020
and the consumer apathy towards its detriments.

12:41.020 --> 12:43.600
These conditions have created this.

12:43.600 --> 12:48.600
Comfort Suites, Hampton Inn, Burger King, Best Western, Shoney's, Quality Inn, Dunkin'

12:48.600 --> 12:53.680
Donuts, America's Best Value Inn, and Marathon Gas are all franchises.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.880
Every single business here is built on the principles of standardization, and this is

12:57.880 --> 13:00.980
hardly a cherry-picked example.

13:00.980 --> 13:06.740
Across America, 57% of limited-service restaurants operate as part of a franchise, and this proportion

13:06.740 --> 13:11.800
tends to rise in step with the state's poverty rate—while it's only 31 and 38% in New

13:11.800 --> 13:17.880
York and Massachusetts, respectively, it's as much as 71 and 78% in West Virginia and

13:17.880 --> 13:18.880
Mississippi.

13:18.880 --> 13:23.280
But the economic and social forces supporting sameness are not restricted to the working

13:23.280 --> 13:27.080
and middle class—they're not even restricted to the US.

13:27.080 --> 13:32.800
These are four major business districts in Sydney, Santiago, London, and Frankfurt.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.860
Without first-hand knowledge of the intricacies of their skylines, it'd be tough to differentiate

13:36.860 --> 13:39.600
which is where, and there's a good reason for this.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.000
For all intents and purposes, these are the same places.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.600
These are ten major multinational businesses either directly in or tangentially related

13:48.600 --> 13:49.760
to the finance sector.

13:49.760 --> 13:55.440
Out of a whole city of options, nine are located in London's compact Canary Wharf

13:55.440 --> 13:56.440
neighborhood.

13:56.440 --> 14:01.400
Meanwhile, in Frankfurt's Bencken-Wirttel neighborhood, eight of the same companies.

14:01.400 --> 14:06.560
Across the Atlantic, 7,500 miles or 12,000 kilometers away in Santiago's San Hatton

14:06.560 --> 14:11.360
neighborhood, nine of the same companies—all located within a few blocks of each other.

14:11.360 --> 14:15.980
Then, finally, across an equally sized stretch of the Pacific, there's Sydney's central

14:15.980 --> 14:20.480
business district, home to all ten of these multinational companies.

14:20.480 --> 14:24.740
These areas and urban cores are often home to the most evocative buildings in a city's

14:24.740 --> 14:28.620
skyline, but these buildings are typically used by people whose preferences are standardized

14:28.620 --> 14:29.860
on a global scale.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.900
On a micro-level, that's because people often move between these business districts

14:33.900 --> 14:37.820
as they move within their companies, and of course, on a macro-level because it's the

14:37.820 --> 14:41.980
exact same companies signing the leases for these buildings globally.

14:41.980 --> 14:46.940
They want the same thing, whether it's in Sydney, Santiago, London, or Frankfurt.

14:46.940 --> 14:51.860
This all starts to point towards a cause broader than building codes, franchising, or the international

14:51.860 --> 14:54.740
flows within multinational companies.

14:54.740 --> 14:57.820
The world encourages sameness.

14:57.820 --> 15:03.860
No matter who we are or where we go, we sometimes just want to be able to get quick, decent,

15:03.860 --> 15:05.800
cheap, warm food.

15:05.800 --> 15:09.740
When we just finished a double shift or woke up early for a 6am flight, we don't want

15:09.740 --> 15:13.380
to have to comb through a menu we've never seen to eat something that we might like or

15:13.380 --> 15:14.680
might hate.

15:14.680 --> 15:18.340
We want what fast food provides—we want to be able to get the same burger in a few

15:18.340 --> 15:21.820
minutes no matter where on earth we find ourselves.

15:21.820 --> 15:24.580
Fast food provides consistent mediocrity.

15:24.580 --> 15:28.420
We might not always want this, but when we're eating just for the sake of eating, that can

15:28.420 --> 15:30.060
be a feature.

15:30.060 --> 15:34.340
The wants and needs of humans were no different a century or two ago.

15:34.340 --> 15:38.400
McDonald's would have been just as successful in the 1800s if it existed.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.360
What has changed, however, is the world.

15:41.360 --> 15:45.800
Devoid of jet airplanes and internet access, it would have been impossible to run a chain

15:45.800 --> 15:48.260
of cheap restaurants spanning the globe.

15:48.260 --> 15:53.320
Not only that, but you can't grow tomatoes in Norway—it's too cold.

15:53.320 --> 15:57.960
Therefore, lacking the long-distance, cold-chain supply lines of today, there was no way to

15:57.960 --> 16:02.760
get the tomato necessary to make the same burger in Norway as in California.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.000
Local conditions dictated what was possible locally.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.320
That's no longer the case.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.780
What happened next is globalization.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.340
The walls came down.

16:13.340 --> 16:17.840
With cargo ships, airplanes, and internet cables linking each country to the next, getting

16:17.840 --> 16:22.080
that tomato anywhere and then instructing the local staff on how to cut it is hardly

16:22.080 --> 16:23.440
a challenge anymore.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.080
The forces encouraging difference disappeared.

16:26.080 --> 16:31.620
What's left is economies of scale, is consumer preference for consistency, is the effectiveness

16:31.620 --> 16:36.380
of branding, is the creeping consolidation of capital—what's left, in a world devoid

16:36.380 --> 16:40.100
of walls, is the pervasive power of sameness.

16:40.100 --> 16:46.300
Now, it's this exact power that has yielded plenty of the advances of the modern age.

16:46.300 --> 16:51.660
It's for these exact reasons why the standard of living of the average person has never

16:51.660 --> 16:52.840
been higher.

16:52.840 --> 16:57.660
If we still had to build houses in the timber-scarce American Southwest out of adobe bricks, it'd

16:57.660 --> 17:00.540
hardly be the fastest-growing region in the country.

17:00.540 --> 17:04.500
Nowadays, timber prices barely differ whether you're at a Lowe's bordering the forest

17:04.500 --> 17:08.140
in Oregon or a Lowe's in the middle of the desert in Arizona.

17:08.140 --> 17:12.420
In an environment devoid of difference, it's just as effective to build those five-over-ones

17:12.420 --> 17:14.820
in Arizona or Oregon.

17:14.820 --> 17:17.300
So, is this a problem?

17:17.300 --> 17:20.580
If there's an objectively best option for addressing the country's crippling need

17:20.580 --> 17:23.460
for more multifamily housing, should it be avoided?

17:23.460 --> 17:28.220
If a national chain of hotels is able to offer consistent, decent rooms at a lower cost than

17:28.220 --> 17:30.220
competitors, is that a bad thing?

17:30.220 --> 17:34.480
If there's simply a style of skyscraper that those who use the skyscrapers want most,

17:34.480 --> 17:36.080
are they at fault?

17:36.080 --> 17:42.440
Well, consistency should be recognized for what it is—a convenience with a cost.

17:42.440 --> 17:47.100
The difficulty is that the convenience and the cost are experienced by different parties.

17:47.100 --> 17:51.500
When that roadside hotel in Chiloquin, Oregon uses the exact same floor plan as its equivalent

17:51.500 --> 17:56.120
in Webb City, Missouri, the majority of the benefit is experienced by the owners who are

17:56.120 --> 17:59.400
able to set up an equally profitable business or less.

17:59.400 --> 18:04.180
Meanwhile, the majority of the cost is experienced by those living in Chiloquin, who experience

18:04.180 --> 18:08.620
the built-up environment of an area as unique as Oregon's Endless Wilderness adapted

18:08.620 --> 18:11.860
into the epitome of any town USA.

18:11.860 --> 18:16.820
The creeping sameness of the modern world is not a big problem—rather, it's a series

18:16.820 --> 18:22.820
of small problems that are experienced again and again and again by everyone—but just

18:22.820 --> 18:27.140
because a problem is small, and just because a problem relates to far bigger ones, it's

18:27.140 --> 18:28.740
still a problem.

18:28.740 --> 18:34.000
Solutions respond to their environment, and humans are part of the urban environment.

18:34.000 --> 18:39.100
If priorities change, the environment changes, and so will the solutions.

18:39.100 --> 18:44.040
As of yet, few seem exceptionally concerned—no surprise in the country that's now been

18:44.040 --> 18:48.720
building cookie-cutter suburban developments for decades—but we don't have to be content

18:48.720 --> 18:51.760
with reality just because it's happening.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.560
So, consider what a common development style does to cities.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.940
Consider whether we want the same dining options in every town, big or small.

18:59.940 --> 19:02.840
Consider the sameness.

19:02.840 --> 19:07.080
This is the first ever video I posted on this channel, and as you can see here, it has stock

19:07.080 --> 19:08.160
footage.

19:08.160 --> 19:11.640
That stock footage, and a huge chunk of the footage we've used since then, came from

19:11.640 --> 19:16.280
the provider I've used ever since, and who's actually today's sponsor, Storyblocks.

19:16.280 --> 19:20.160
Most stock footage providers charge per clip, sometimes in the hundreds of dollars, which

19:20.160 --> 19:23.640
really just doesn't work with the economics of digital video.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.620
Storyblocks, however, offers an unlimited download subscription for less than what the

19:27.620 --> 19:31.780
other providers charge for one clip, and with that you get access to their huge catalog

19:31.780 --> 19:37.000
of footage for your videos, your posts, your presentation, anything you do online.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.300
Not only that, but Storyblocks also offers stock images, music, audio, After Effects

19:41.300 --> 19:43.180
and Premiere templates, and more.

19:43.180 --> 19:46.760
The reason we've been using Storyblocks for years, long before they sponsored us,

19:46.760 --> 19:49.860
is because they are the one-stop-shop for digital creation.

19:49.860 --> 19:53.920
I don't think I know a single full-time creator that doesn't have a subscription

19:53.920 --> 19:54.920
to them.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.700
So, if you make anything online, it's worth checking them out—subscribing could be one

19:58.700 --> 20:01.320
of the best investments you ever make in your content.

20:01.320 --> 20:05.760

20:05.760 --> 20:08.040
