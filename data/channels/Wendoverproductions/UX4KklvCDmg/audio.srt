1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
This is Virginia, this is Fredericksburg, and this is Plank Road.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,360
It's the kind of road that forms where interstates output their trucks and cars—peppered with

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,520
gas stations, fast food chains, mid-market hotels, big box stores, and ample parking

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,520
for all.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,220
If you've traveled the US, you certainly know the type.

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,940
The convenience of quick interstate access, the space for car-centric design, and the

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,120
co-location with other establishments has drawn retail and restaurants away from city

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,160
centers and into the hinterlands, so, increasingly, for all but the most urban or most rural Americans,

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,840
these interstate exit areas have become a constant in daily life.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,960
In fact, places like Fredericksburg's Plank Road have become so ubiquitous, so persistent

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
in the US, that it'd be remarkably easy to miss that this is not actually Plank Road

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,420
in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,420
That was a lie.

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,760
In fact, not only are none of these clips from Virginia, they're not even from the

15
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,080
same location.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,660
This is Portland, Maine, this is Cookeville, Tennessee, Marietta, Georgia, El Paso, Texas,

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,560
and Los Angeles, California.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,960
These interstate exit streets have a style—one that's consistent across the 50 states.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:12,400
It's so intuitive to today's Americans that when we see the golden arches approaching,

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,960
we know we just need to take the coming exit and follow the road straight until arrival—nothing

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,360
complicated like burdensome turns.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,240
Upon arrival to the subject McDonald's, we know where to look for the bathroom—it's

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,240
typically towards the back, next to the side entry door.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,800
The same can be said for roadside hotels, for gas stations, and for big box stores—we

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,080
might not realize it, but before even stepping in, thanks to nationwide standardization,

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,440
we have an intuitive understanding of where the bathroom or register is.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,100
The US is a fantastically inconsistent country.

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,560
The degree of difference between the landscapes of Utah and Maine, or Florida and Alaska,

29
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,080
is one typically reserved for continents, not countries.

30
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,940
The people of New York City and North Dakota live enormously different lives—a given

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,320
day in Minot looks nothing like that in Manhattan.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,520
A defining characteristic of this country is its heterogeneity, and yet, the places

33
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,520
in which its people live, the cities and towns they've constructed, are eerily similar.

34
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,160
Anchorage could be in Alabama, and Columbus could be in California.

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,140
Simply put, outside of the oldest areas, the way in which urban America is being built

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,620
is exceptionally homogeneous.

37
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,000
Consider these.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,580
If one type of building has come to define the increasing sameness of urban and suburban

39
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,660
America, it's the 5 over 1.

40
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,060
While they're never the exact same, they do look similar.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:43,260
With punchy names like the Union or Uncommon, and advertisements prompting a sense of community

42
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,820
and trendy amenities, they feel similar, too.

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,780
Their 5 over 1 moniker stems from their building code designation—structurally, they're

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,540
a wooden, Type 5 fire-resistant building sitting atop a Type 1 base floor of concrete.

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,060
Dotting the edges of downtowns and dominating new developments, these mid-rises teeming

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,460
with young professionals are big, pushing up to the very edge of sidewalks, they're

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,020
blocky, an unrelenting assemblage of 90-degree angles, and they're popping up everywhere

48
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,960
from Maine to Montana.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,780
In the past, apartments were small, looking not so different from a large house, or they

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,180
were massive—steel and concrete structures that scraped the sky.

51
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,680
Nowadays, when you conjure up an apartment building in your head, it looks like this.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,540
And just how these boxy, boring, but important structures came to define the current apartment

53
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,020
building boom comes from a surprisingly specific few lines of building code.

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,140
In the US, building codes are each municipality's choice.

55
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,260
The rules and standards by which a city is built can vary from town to town in relation

56
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,740
to what exactly a town wants.

57
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,260
And yet, building codes in the US rarely differ.

58
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,620
A town of 500 just doesn't have the time or resources to write their own comprehensive

59
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,260
thousand-page building code, so they typically just adopt this one—the International Building

60
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
Code.

61
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,380
Originally written within living memory of the Great Chicago Fire, these codes, on account

62
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,100
of fire prevention, limited wood buildings to three stories.

63
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,820
While floor limits eased to five over the decades, codes into the 1990s required walls

64
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,380
built out of non-combustible material, hampering the cost advantage of wood-framed apartment

65
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
buildings.

66
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,660
But then the code added an exception—that exterior and interior walls built with flame-retardant-treated

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,620
wood could be considered non-combustible.

68
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,380
As the story goes, an LA architect, Tim Smith, caught the change, identified his potential

69
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,700
as a cheap alternative to steel and concrete, and built the first ever five over one.

70
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,260
Building codes made these structures possible.

71
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,820
They didn't, however, make them profitable.

72
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,800
That was the work of American zoning practices.

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,820
The rise of boxy, balloon-framed housing cubes is the result of just how much urban and suburban

74
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:58,180
land is zoned for single-family homes—around three-fourths of all residential land in the

75
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,180
US.

76
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,860
In the western states, with generally younger and more sprawling urban areas, these numbers

77
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,300
trend higher.

78
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,780
Take Fort Collins, for example.

79
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,740
Fort Collins is a college town of over 100,000 north of Denver.

80
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,820
It's a place with a perpetual need for housing to keep up with an increasing student body

81
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,880
and a growing city population, yet, despite the flat plains of seemingly developable land

82
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,740
that surround it, it really has no room for dense housing projects.

83
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,900
All this is zoned for low-density single-family homes and duplexes—this, too.

84
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,820
This is downtown where apartment buildings are fair game, but Fort Collins is relatively

85
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,780
old so much of downtown is already accounted for.

86
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,920
This area next to downtown is old, too, so it's zoned to protect the historic neighborhood

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,940
and is largely off limits.

88
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,360
All this is commercially zoned, so apartments are allowed there, but it's on a state highway,

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,280
so any housing project will have to compete with businesses for the prime real estate.

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,140
With so much of the town accounted for, this is the result.

91
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,500
Five over ones cluster in the tiny area around campus zoned for high-density housing, while

92
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,740
the rest randomly pop up on the edge of downtown or just off the highway.

93
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,620
This pattern is not unique to Fort Collins.

94
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,260
While housing is desperately needed nationwide, so much land has been ceded to detached family

95
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,820
homes, cul-de-sacs, and white picket fences that high-density housing is left to fight

96
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,660
over the scraps—maximizing the amount of units they squeeze onto pricey plots and competing

97
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,660
with retail and office developers over highway exits and the fringes of downtowns and industrial

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,660
areas.

99
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,220
Of course, what makes these five over ones look like they're all built by the same

100
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,700
people is the fact that they're all built by the same people.

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:43,260
Of the 293,000 large building housing units developed in 2019, 94,000, a third, were constructed

102
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,900
by the country's 25 largest developers.

103
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,220
Over the past decade, the US multifamily housing market has fallen into a vicious cycle of

104
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,700
consolidation leading to consolidation leading to consolidation.

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,460
To start, the limited availability of multifamily zoned land drives up its price, meaning a

106
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,300
smaller tranche of developers can afford it.

107
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,540
Not only that, but an even smaller tranche of developers can afford to develop that land

108
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:12,580
into a project large and dense enough to attain profitability given the higher purchase price.

109
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:17,780
Simultaneously, however, these large developers enjoy economies of scale with these large

110
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
buildings.

111
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,740
They're able to build equivalent apartments for less thanks to more shared walls, elevators,

112
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,340
mechanicals, management, and more.

113
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,580
And of course, thanks to American building codes, deeper pockets, and an inherent need

114
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,900
to build bigger on more expensive lots, they're able to do what smaller developers cannot

115
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,780
and further reduce per-unit costs by maxing out the lot lines with 5 over 1s.

116
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,120
On a per-unit basis, 5 over 1s are cheaper to build—wood is far less expensive than

117
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,300
alternate materials.

118
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,060
It's easier to work with, too, driving down labor costs and minimizing the use of unionized

119
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
trayspeople.

120
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,060
Therefore, these buildings outcompete smaller buildings in the market, the developers grow

121
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,740
wealthier, and with that wealth they're able to expand across state lines.

122
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,980
And of course, the process becomes even cheaper when they recycle plans, shuffle specialized

123
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:07,640
staff across the country, and apply these same proven strategies to different markets.

124
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,260
From the pool deck, Greystar Real Estate's Ayla building doesn't look so different

125
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,300
from their Canvas on Blake development, despite two time zones separating them, but in today's

126
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,820
housing market, this is hardly surprising.

127
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:24,740
Now, on the surface, these 5 over 1s appear to address a major need in the American housing

128
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,180
market—walkable, reasonably priced multifamily rental units in and around urban cores.

129
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,060
However, the consolidation behind these buildings has accelerated the propagation of another

130
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,820
can of worms—the corporate landlord.

131
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,400
Now, these 5 over 1 developments are almost always constructed as rental buildings, yet

132
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,860
rarely act as affordable housing.

133
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,260
In Denver, for example, the rent for the cheapest units at the Broadstone on 9th, Canvas on

134
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,940
Blake or 20th Street Station buildings either meets or exceeds the city average.

135
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,180
Rather, these apartments succeed because they out-compete their closest mid-market competitors.

136
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,020
You typically just can't get a new, modern, walkable apartment in smaller boutique or

137
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,820
massive older developments for a similar price.

138
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,700
Therefore, 5 over 1s and these massive developers have cornered an underserved segment of the

139
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:16,580
housing market, and that means they can get away with a lot.

140
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,100
Countless examples have emerged of the difficulty of having a corporation as a landlord.

141
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,720
San Francisco renters, in a building where a one-bedroom went for $2,800 a month, recounted

142
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,840
how Graystar increased rents and fees, while cutting staffing and services to the point

143
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,700
that trash piled up in hallways, and neighbors had to borrow one another's showers when

144
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,140
building boilers went out of service.

145
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,340
Now, looking at 2020 census data, the US is building more multifamily housing than it

146
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:46,340
has at any point this century, and while the data don't directly tell us how many of

147
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:51,740
these are 5 over 1s, when looking at building material, style, and size characteristics,

148
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,820
it becomes clear that 5 over 1s and buildings like them make up the vast majority of these

149
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,280
new builds.

150
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,580
Of course, in the face of dramatic housing shortages, this should be a good thing, but

151
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,700
the reality is that 5 over 1s are not built to house those most acutely feeling the effects

152
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,700
of these shortages.

153
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,260
While there is an argument to be made that their construction frees up units for those

154
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,800
who might otherwise have been displaced, that clearly comes at a less than ideal cost.

155
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,000
Across America, plenty more places and circumstances have converged to create the ideal environments

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,440
for homogeneity.

157
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,700
Within those ubiquitous interstate exit roadways, there is a common landscape of Hampton, Holiday,

158
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,420
and La Quinta Inns.

159
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,220
Rarely are these areas punctuated by independent hotels—it's almost always the same selection

160
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,820
of nationwide brands—and when walking into, say, the Sleep Inn in Chiloquin, Oregon, you'd

161
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,940
be forgiven for thinking it looks familiar.

162
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,740
That's because the exact same hotel exists, down to the inch, 1,500 miles or 2,500 kilometers

163
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,020
away in Webb City, Missouri.

164
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,260
Of course, this is all part of the business model—in fact, it's the genius of the

165
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,260
business model.

166
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,760
You see, Sleep Inn is a brand owned by Choice Hotels International—one of the largest

167
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,480
hotel chains in the world, running some 7,000 properties globally.

168
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,920
However, the company doesn't own these hotels—only the brands.

169
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,980
That's because they're a franchisor, just like McDonald's or Burger King.

170
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,780
An independent franchisee comes to Choice when they want to start a hotel, and the company

171
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:24,200
provides a menu of brands to choose from, each targeting a slightly different segment

172
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
of consumers.

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,700
Then, the franchisee must decide what floor plan they want, whether to include a pool,

174
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,120
and which of the four color schemes to use.

175
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,500
They then sign a contract with one of the Choice Hotels approved contractors for construction,

176
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,560
write some checks, and that's about it.

177
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,040
The franchise model cuts huge chunks, and therefore costs, out of the process—designing

178
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,480
the building, adapting the design in response to permitting issues, vetting contractors,

179
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,280
figuring out how to manage a hotel.

180
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,300
It allows anyone to become a hotelier, which is exactly what Choice Hotels wants because,

181
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:01,080
as long as it's anyone but them, the financial constraint and risk is gone.

182
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,200
On the consumer side, whether it's a road-tripper pulling into the parking lot after dark, a

183
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,380
pilot stopping for their ten hours of mandated rest, or a consultant hitting their sick city

184
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,040
in a month, uniqueness often has little value—in fact, it might be a negative for the weary

185
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,540
traveler compared to a standardized, familiar offering.

186
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,280
The market speaks for itself, and so does the market research.

187
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,840
Independent hotels are no longer truly able to compete in this mid-market sector—they

188
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,080
now focus on the higher end of the spectrum, where the hotel is more of a destination than

189
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
a waypoint.

190
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,000
So, in the hotel sector, this standardization stems from the cost savings born out of homogeneity,

191
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,020
and the consumer apathy towards its detriments.

192
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,600
These conditions have created this.

193
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Comfort Suites, Hampton Inn, Burger King, Best Western, Shoney's, Quality Inn, Dunkin'

194
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,680
Donuts, America's Best Value Inn, and Marathon Gas are all franchises.

195
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,880
Every single business here is built on the principles of standardization, and this is

196
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,980
hardly a cherry-picked example.

197
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,740
Across America, 57% of limited-service restaurants operate as part of a franchise, and this proportion

198
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,800
tends to rise in step with the state's poverty rate—while it's only 31 and 38% in New

199
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,880
York and Massachusetts, respectively, it's as much as 71 and 78% in West Virginia and

200
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Mississippi.

201
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,280
But the economic and social forces supporting sameness are not restricted to the working

202
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,080
and middle class—they're not even restricted to the US.

203
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,800
These are four major business districts in Sydney, Santiago, London, and Frankfurt.

204
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,860
Without first-hand knowledge of the intricacies of their skylines, it'd be tough to differentiate

205
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,600
which is where, and there's a good reason for this.

206
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,000
For all intents and purposes, these are the same places.

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,600
These are ten major multinational businesses either directly in or tangentially related

208
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,760
to the finance sector.

209
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
Out of a whole city of options, nine are located in London's compact Canary Wharf

210
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
neighborhood.

211
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,400
Meanwhile, in Frankfurt's Bencken-Wirttel neighborhood, eight of the same companies.

212
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,560
Across the Atlantic, 7,500 miles or 12,000 kilometers away in Santiago's San Hatton

213
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,360
neighborhood, nine of the same companies—all located within a few blocks of each other.

214
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,980
Then, finally, across an equally sized stretch of the Pacific, there's Sydney's central

215
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,480
business district, home to all ten of these multinational companies.

216
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,740
These areas and urban cores are often home to the most evocative buildings in a city's

217
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:28,620
skyline, but these buildings are typically used by people whose preferences are standardized

218
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,860
on a global scale.

219
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,900
On a micro-level, that's because people often move between these business districts

220
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,820
as they move within their companies, and of course, on a macro-level because it's the

221
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,980
exact same companies signing the leases for these buildings globally.

222
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,940
They want the same thing, whether it's in Sydney, Santiago, London, or Frankfurt.

223
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:51,860
This all starts to point towards a cause broader than building codes, franchising, or the international

224
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,740
flows within multinational companies.

225
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,820
The world encourages sameness.

226
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,860
No matter who we are or where we go, we sometimes just want to be able to get quick, decent,

227
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,800
cheap, warm food.

228
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,740
When we just finished a double shift or woke up early for a 6am flight, we don't want

229
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,380
to have to comb through a menu we've never seen to eat something that we might like or

230
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,680
might hate.

231
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,340
We want what fast food provides—we want to be able to get the same burger in a few

232
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:21,820
minutes no matter where on earth we find ourselves.

233
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,580
Fast food provides consistent mediocrity.

234
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:28,420
We might not always want this, but when we're eating just for the sake of eating, that can

235
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,060
be a feature.

236
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,340
The wants and needs of humans were no different a century or two ago.

237
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,400
McDonald's would have been just as successful in the 1800s if it existed.

238
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,360
What has changed, however, is the world.

239
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,800
Devoid of jet airplanes and internet access, it would have been impossible to run a chain

240
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,260
of cheap restaurants spanning the globe.

241
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,320
Not only that, but you can't grow tomatoes in Norway—it's too cold.

242
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,960
Therefore, lacking the long-distance, cold-chain supply lines of today, there was no way to

243
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:02,760
get the tomato necessary to make the same burger in Norway as in California.

244
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,000
Local conditions dictated what was possible locally.

245
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,320
That's no longer the case.

246
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,780
What happened next is globalization.

247
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,340
The walls came down.

248
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,840
With cargo ships, airplanes, and internet cables linking each country to the next, getting

249
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,080
that tomato anywhere and then instructing the local staff on how to cut it is hardly

250
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,440
a challenge anymore.

251
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,080
The forces encouraging difference disappeared.

252
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,620
What's left is economies of scale, is consumer preference for consistency, is the effectiveness

253
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,380
of branding, is the creeping consolidation of capital—what's left, in a world devoid

254
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,100
of walls, is the pervasive power of sameness.

255
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,300
Now, it's this exact power that has yielded plenty of the advances of the modern age.

256
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,660
It's for these exact reasons why the standard of living of the average person has never

257
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,840
been higher.

258
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,660
If we still had to build houses in the timber-scarce American Southwest out of adobe bricks, it'd

259
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,540
hardly be the fastest-growing region in the country.

260
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,500
Nowadays, timber prices barely differ whether you're at a Lowe's bordering the forest

261
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,140
in Oregon or a Lowe's in the middle of the desert in Arizona.

262
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,420
In an environment devoid of difference, it's just as effective to build those five-over-ones

263
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,820
in Arizona or Oregon.

264
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,300
So, is this a problem?

265
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,580
If there's an objectively best option for addressing the country's crippling need

266
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,460
for more multifamily housing, should it be avoided?

267
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:28,220
If a national chain of hotels is able to offer consistent, decent rooms at a lower cost than

268
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,220
competitors, is that a bad thing?

269
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,480
If there's simply a style of skyscraper that those who use the skyscrapers want most,

270
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,080
are they at fault?

271
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,440
Well, consistency should be recognized for what it is—a convenience with a cost.

272
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,100
The difficulty is that the convenience and the cost are experienced by different parties.

273
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,500
When that roadside hotel in Chiloquin, Oregon uses the exact same floor plan as its equivalent

274
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,120
in Webb City, Missouri, the majority of the benefit is experienced by the owners who are

275
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,400
able to set up an equally profitable business or less.

276
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,180
Meanwhile, the majority of the cost is experienced by those living in Chiloquin, who experience

277
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,620
the built-up environment of an area as unique as Oregon's Endless Wilderness adapted

278
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,860
into the epitome of any town USA.

279
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,820
The creeping sameness of the modern world is not a big problem—rather, it's a series

280
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:22,820
of small problems that are experienced again and again and again by everyone—but just

281
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,140
because a problem is small, and just because a problem relates to far bigger ones, it's

282
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,740
still a problem.

283
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,000
Solutions respond to their environment, and humans are part of the urban environment.

284
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,100
If priorities change, the environment changes, and so will the solutions.

285
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:44,040
As of yet, few seem exceptionally concerned—no surprise in the country that's now been

286
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:48,720
building cookie-cutter suburban developments for decades—but we don't have to be content

287
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,760
with reality just because it's happening.

288
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,560
So, consider what a common development style does to cities.

289
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,940
Consider whether we want the same dining options in every town, big or small.

290
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,840
Consider the sameness.

291
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,080
This is the first ever video I posted on this channel, and as you can see here, it has stock

292
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,160
footage.

293
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,640
That stock footage, and a huge chunk of the footage we've used since then, came from

294
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,280
the provider I've used ever since, and who's actually today's sponsor, Storyblocks.

295
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,160
Most stock footage providers charge per clip, sometimes in the hundreds of dollars, which

296
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,640
really just doesn't work with the economics of digital video.

297
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,620
Storyblocks, however, offers an unlimited download subscription for less than what the

298
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,780
other providers charge for one clip, and with that you get access to their huge catalog

299
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,000
of footage for your videos, your posts, your presentation, anything you do online.

300
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,300
Not only that, but Storyblocks also offers stock images, music, audio, After Effects

301
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,180
and Premiere templates, and more.

302
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,760
The reason we've been using Storyblocks for years, long before they sponsored us,

303
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,860
is because they are the one-stop-shop for digital creation.

304
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,920
I don't think I know a single full-time creator that doesn't have a subscription

305
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
to them.

306
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,700
So, if you make anything online, it's worth checking them out—subscribing could be one

307
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,320
of the best investments you ever make in your content.

308
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,760
Click the button on screen or head to Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be

309
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,040
