00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,240
Nearly ten years ago, in the mid-afternoon of January 12th, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,380
hit just outside Port-au-Prince, Haiti, leveling a large part of the country and killing an

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,640
unimaginable number of people in a quick 30 seconds.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,620
It immediately became clear that, although the earthquake lasted only seconds, the humanitarian

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,440
disaster would last for years because of three simple facts.

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,600
One was the earthquake's location.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,500
In a twist of terrible luck, the quake hit shallow and just 16 miles or 25 kilometers

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,040
away from the country's capital and largest city, Port-au-Prince.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,360
Two was Haiti's economic situation.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,760
It is the poorest country in the western hemisphere with an estimated GDP per capita, at the time

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,620
of the earthquake, of just $665.

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,040
That meant that most Haitians had little money to relocate and re-establish their lives after

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,880
their homes were destroyed.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,860
In addition, with a poorly funded government, emergency services were few and far between

17
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,580
and poorly equipped.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,120
The third fact leading to the scale of the humanitarian disaster was just the pure scale

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,560
of destruction.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,120
Most buildings in the island nation were not nearly as stable as those in a developed nation

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,560
and therefore, whereas another, developed country might have been able to weather the

22
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,800
quake quite well, the buildings of Haiti crumbled like dust.

23
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,520
With the scale of destruction, as soon as word of the quake reached the rest of the

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,680
world, the focus of every major disaster response organization in the world shifted to Haiti.

25
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,720
The whole world of disaster response is a nuanced and complex one.

26
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,920
Simply showing up and helping where one can just doesn't work.

27
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,380
Water isn't useful by itself, food isn't useful by itself, doctors aren't useful

28
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,840
by themselves.

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,000
Every resource that might be needed following a disaster must be carefully coordinated and

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,080
managed or else it is useless.

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,320
Behind that management, there are professionals who spend their whole lives working on how

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:11,520
to best respond to moments like these—the worst 30 seconds of Haiti's history.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
I spoke to two of those professionals on how they do their jobs.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:31,400
Stephanie Caden, and Mike van Rooyen.

35
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,560
Both Stephanie and Mike helped establish and then worked on the ground at what became one

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,520
of the largest field hospitals in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake.

37
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,560
It turns out that when you're a doctor responding to one of these international disasters,

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
just having medical knowledge is not good enough.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,800
In order to do this work properly, you have to know what the international standards are

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,920
for giving humanitarian aid.

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,240
You have to know not only the medical side, but how to give food and how to give clean

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,960
water and how to give proper shelter.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,580
And those guidelines are already written down in something called the Sphere Standards.

44
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,260
Within its 406 pages, the Sphere Handbook has specific guidelines like that everyone

45
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,720
needs 15 liters of water per day, that a single hand pump at a flow rate of 17 liters per

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
minute can act as the water source for up to 500 people, it gives a clear step-by-step

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,540
guide to establishing a goods delivery system, it defines that, in an emergency shelter situation,

48
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,780
everyone should have at least 38 square feet or 3.5 square meters of living space but that,

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,340
in cold climates, that should be increased to 48 square feet or 4.5 square meters.

50
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,700
It takes out as much of the guesswork and humanitarian response as possible.

51
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,260
This is what much of the work by academics like Stephanie and Mike is—developing standards

52
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,940
and frameworks before a disaster happens so that, as much as possible, when disaster strikes,

53
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,380
people don't need to think, they just need to do.

54
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,940
This response does, of course, though, vary depending on the nature of the disaster.

55
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:04,980
An earthquake tends to cause a lot of death immediately and also a lot of heavy injuries

56
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,780
like fractures or head injuries.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,500
They are intensive—they require intensive medical care and surgical care.

58
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,700
They overwhelm the hospital structures as well and so the immediate needs for a place

59
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,540
like Haiti, for example, are surgeons and people who could manage emergency wound care

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,100
and even things like dialysis or things like that, that these crush injuries happen.

61
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,900
And they also require a lot of rehabilitation.

62
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,280
Let's take another example of, say, a flood, right?

63
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,180
A flood can be amazingly devastating, move people out of their house, even sweep people

64
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,340
away.

65
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,420
A flood or a hurricane kills people but doesn't necessarily leave a lot of injured people.

66
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:55,340
So at the end, after people have died from a massive flood or a hurricane, what's left

67
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,800
are people who have minor injuries, maybe, but they don't really overwhelm the surgical

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,060
structures of a hospital.

69
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,100
What they overwhelm is the public health.

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,060
In an ideal world, the level of humanitarian aid given would be determined by the actual

71
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,500
need, but in reality, this is often not the case.

72
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,420
The reality is that often, but not always, the more accessible a disaster site is, the

73
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,560
more response it gets.

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,700
What that means is that, because Haiti was so close to the US, where many humanitarian

75
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,420
organizations are based, it was quite easy for them to mobilize after this earthquake

76
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,700
so Haiti got large numbers of responders quite quickly, but this principle can also leave

77
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,760
other countries without the help they need.

78
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,460
So take, for example, around the same time as the Haiti earthquake, there was a massive

79
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,700
flood in Pakistan, but it was very remote and very difficult to get to.

80
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,820
So the difference in the responders is entirely different.

81
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,940
The only people that could respond in this distant area of Pakistan for this massive

82
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,780
flood were the major organizations that had lifting capacity and they could fly planes

83
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,260
in and they could land personnel in in the middle of someplace that's very remote.

84
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,380
Haiti, on the other hand, received a massive response, especially in comparison by smaller

85
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,940
organizations, given the proximity to the US, and also given the fact that individuals

86
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,980
in the US were particularly motivated to donate given the proximity.

87
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:23,020
Through NGOs and charities, Americans contributed about $4 billion to the relief effort in the

88
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,860
first three months.

89
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,080
Therefore, the real issue in Haiti was not getting a response—it was managing the response.

90
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,360
Because of that accessibility from the US, a huge number of less professional responders

91
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,320
showed up, and in order to be effective, these responders needed a high degree of management

92
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,720
from the professionals who did show up and were practiced on the international standards.

93
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,900
In addition, there was the issue of actually getting all these responders and their supplies

94
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,400
there.

95
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,440
In the case of Haiti, it's an island nation, so a lot of the heavy things like fuel have

96
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,360
to come in by ship.

97
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,320
But the earthquake severely damaged the port in Port-au-Prince, and because the gas stations

98
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,800
with their underground tanks had also been damaged, the relief community couldn't use

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,000
the fuel from those tanks without ruining the engines in their cars and shutting down

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,700
all the trucks.

101
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:21,300
And so there was a big fuel crisis early on, and that meant it was hard to transport things.

102
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,820
So while we were waiting for the port to be fixed, a lot of the supplies had to be flown

103
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:33,660
in, either on airplanes that were landing at the Port-au-Prince airport, or overland

104
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
from the Dominican Republic.

105
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,300
In the early days of the response, both of these methods had their own unique difficulties.

106
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,260
Coming from the Dominican Republic, many of these roads were damaged, destroyed, or covered

107
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,580
in debris, so that was quite a slow option.

108
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:53,140
The airport therefore stood alone as the only high-speed link between Haiti and the world,

109
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,900
serving as the only route in for all the most time-sensitive supplies.

110
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,420
In the initial 24 hours after the earthquake, Port-au-Prince's airport saw chaos as flights

111
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,420
poured in with no direction into an airport with essentially no control.

112
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,420
The first semblance of control came the morning after the quake, when the US Coast Guard Cutter

113
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,860
Forward pulled into Port-au-Prince and just hours later started working as the airport's

114
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
air traffic control from the ship.

115
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,740
The airport's own air traffic control tower was badly damaged in the quake, so it was

116
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,480
far from operational.

117
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,180
Soon after, that same afternoon, a team of US Air Force airmen landed at the airport

118
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,020
and assumed responsibility for its air traffic control.

119
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,540
Their operation was made up of, quite literally, a bunch of folding tables and handheld radios

120
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,960
set up at the end of the runway as they guided flights in.

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,360
With this setup, they handled up to almost 200 planes a day despite the fact that on

122
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
a normal day the airport receives no more than a dozen commercial flights.

123
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,840
Eventually, Haiti officially handed control of the airport over to the US, meaning the

124
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,040
Americans could settle in and set up formally for the long haul, and a team from the American

125
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,340
FAA came down to take control as they set up a portable, temporary air traffic control

126
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,340
tower.

127
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,780
Of course, even working at full capacity, there was still an enormous backlog at this

128
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,820
small airport, leading them to set up a system where flights would be prioritized based off

129
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,620
what they carried with the highest demand humanitarian goods being allowed in first.

130
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,680
Of course, even once you get a plane with supplies on the ground, getting those supplies

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,960
to those in need is not a given because, in between the runway and the roads, there

132
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,960
is, of course, customs.

133
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,560
Often what happens is that the national government of the place where the disaster has happened

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,180
has a way of sort of relaxing customs efforts for relief supplies coming in and trying to

135
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:40,140
fast-forward them through, but that doesn't always happen, especially with medical supplies,

136
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:46,420
which can include power for painkillers that might be particularly regulated by a government.

137
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:52,520
And so, a lot of times aid agencies will face a backlog in their relief supplies coming

138
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,000
in as they get sort of stuck in customs.

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,240
Eventually, though, once a solid supply chain is set up, responders can actually get to

140
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,240
work.

141
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,600
Stephanie and Mike, of course, work to set up that field hospital to start treating all

142
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,880
the most severe injuries from the earthquake.

143
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,740
While the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, who they both work for, doesn't typically

144
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,400
itself actually respond on the ground to disasters, they did exceptionally in this case and, as

145
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,740
the literal experts in this sort of activity, they were able to set up a stellar operation.

146
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,980
As experts, they knew, once again, that doctors by themselves aren't necessarily useful.

147
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,660
Doctors are useful when placed where they're needed and so, the first step was to identify

148
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,980
what was needed.

149
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:41,960
So, in the Haiti response, the HHI team identified one major gap in particular and that was the

150
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:48,060
lack of rehabilitation resources for patients that had big operations like orthopedic operations

151
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,780
but had nowhere to go because there was no place to admit them and to rehabilitate them.

152
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,060
Therefore, the hospital had its focus and everything could go from there.

153
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,340
Again, because of the specific nature of the disaster, the team knew that they couldn't

154
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,020
set up their temporary hospital just anywhere.

155
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,780
After an earthquake in particular, when the people who've been injured in the earthquake

156
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,940
have seen all the buildings around them fall down, they do not want to go into another

157
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,400
building because there are a lot of aftershocks afterwards and they're afraid that these buildings

158
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,600
might have been damaged and that they might fall down and either kill them or cause more

159
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,660
injury and that is a very reasonable fear and so, even though the place where we were

160
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,760
working had buildings that were very strong and very well able to sustain all the aftershocks

161
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,360
with little or no damage, the people we were helping were too afraid to go inside them.

162
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,680
The hospital therefore had to be almost entirely built out of tents.

163
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,400
Despite the focus on acting as a rehabilitation center, the hospital did, however, still perform

164
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,480
surgery and therefore they needed a super-sterile environment to prevent infection or contamination

165
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
during surgery.

166
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,840
That's quite tough to create in a series of tents so they used two solutions for this.

167
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,800
One, the easier way, was we had operating theater trucks.

168
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:18,040
So imagine a big delivery truck that you can open the doors and instead of finding boxes

169
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,640
inside, you find an OR or an operating theater.

170
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,700
We had a couple of those and that was very useful because they come already sealed.

171
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,960
A lot of our surgeries though, we had to do in what were classrooms in a school in Haiti

172
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,400
and what we had to do there was to actually tape up sheets over the windows, plastic sheeting,

173
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,560
to make sure that no insects or dust would come from the outside while we were doing

174
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,560
the surgeries so that we could make it a sterile and safe place to do them.

175
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,420
Of course, the goal of responding to humanitarian disasters is to get the humanitarian disaster

176
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,100
to end, so that means there also has to be focus on the exit strategy.

177
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:05,600
When a disaster happens and we go in and start working, even from the first day, we're always

178
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,600
thinking about the day we're going to leave.

179
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,500
What that means is we do a number of things right from the start.

180
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,840
In Haiti, for example, we wanted to make sure that as we were caring for people's wounds,

181
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,100
we were teaching the local doctors and nurses that we were working with how to do that kind

182
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,660
of care if they weren't already familiar with it so that when we left, they would be able

183
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,060
to easily carry that forward.

184
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,300
Getting to that finale—when the agencies pull out, when a country is back to normal,

185
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,320
once life goes on as normal after a disaster—is a delicate science that doesn't always go

186
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
to plan.

187
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,620
No matter how many frameworks, handbooks, and guidelines one has, a disaster is a disaster

188
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,980
and does not follow plans.

189
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:50,020
The role of all the planning and preparation, though, is to provide structure where there

190
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,220
is none.

191
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,960
People like Stephanie and Mike spend their entire career studying and educating others

192
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,840
on this field since certain help is certainly better than other help and, in a case when

193
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,800
the worst has happened, only the best help is enough.

194
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,540
Working in disaster response clearly requires that your problem solving and critical thinking

195
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,880
skills are quick and accurate.

196
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,080
Those skills, in fact, are crucial fundamental skills for life that can help with school,

197
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,320
employment, and much more, both of which can be developed with Brilliant's courses.

198
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,180
Really all of their courses will help with problem solving and critical thinking skills,

199
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,980
but a few that can especially help are their probability and logic courses.

200
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Luckily, both probability and logic are fascinating fields and Brilliant takes you all the way

201
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,520
from the basic to the advanced in these fields with their intuitive, superbly designed courses

202
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,440
that break complex topics into manageable, intuitive principles.
