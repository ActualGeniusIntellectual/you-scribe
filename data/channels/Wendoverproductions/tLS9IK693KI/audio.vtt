00:11.040 --> 00:17.240
Nearly ten years ago, in the mid-afternoon of January 12th, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake

00:17.240 --> 00:22.380
hit just outside Port-au-Prince, Haiti, leveling a large part of the country and killing an

00:22.380 --> 00:26.640
unimaginable number of people in a quick 30 seconds.

00:26.640 --> 00:31.620
It immediately became clear that, although the earthquake lasted only seconds, the humanitarian

00:31.620 --> 00:36.440
disaster would last for years because of three simple facts.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.600
One was the earthquake's location.

00:38.600 --> 00:43.500
In a twist of terrible luck, the quake hit shallow and just 16 miles or 25 kilometers

00:43.500 --> 00:47.040
away from the country's capital and largest city, Port-au-Prince.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.360
Two was Haiti's economic situation.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.760
It is the poorest country in the western hemisphere with an estimated GDP per capita, at the time

00:53.760 --> 00:57.620
of the earthquake, of just $665.

00:57.620 --> 01:02.040
That meant that most Haitians had little money to relocate and re-establish their lives after

01:02.040 --> 01:03.880
their homes were destroyed.

01:03.880 --> 01:08.860
In addition, with a poorly funded government, emergency services were few and far between

01:08.860 --> 01:10.580
and poorly equipped.

01:10.580 --> 01:15.120
The third fact leading to the scale of the humanitarian disaster was just the pure scale

01:15.120 --> 01:16.560
of destruction.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.120
Most buildings in the island nation were not nearly as stable as those in a developed nation

01:21.120 --> 01:24.560
and therefore, whereas another, developed country might have been able to weather the

01:24.560 --> 01:28.800
quake quite well, the buildings of Haiti crumbled like dust.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.520
With the scale of destruction, as soon as word of the quake reached the rest of the

01:32.520 --> 01:39.680
world, the focus of every major disaster response organization in the world shifted to Haiti.

01:39.680 --> 01:43.720
The whole world of disaster response is a nuanced and complex one.

01:43.720 --> 01:47.920
Simply showing up and helping where one can just doesn't work.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.380
Water isn't useful by itself, food isn't useful by itself, doctors aren't useful

01:52.380 --> 01:53.840
by themselves.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.000
Every resource that might be needed following a disaster must be carefully coordinated and

01:58.000 --> 02:01.080
managed or else it is useless.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.320
Behind that management, there are professionals who spend their whole lives working on how

02:05.320 --> 02:11.520
to best respond to moments like these—the worst 30 seconds of Haiti's history.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.120
I spoke to two of those professionals on how they do their jobs.

02:15.120 --> 02:31.400
Stephanie Caden, and Mike van Rooyen.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.560
Both Stephanie and Mike helped establish and then worked on the ground at what became one

02:35.560 --> 02:39.520
of the largest field hospitals in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake.

02:39.520 --> 02:44.560
It turns out that when you're a doctor responding to one of these international disasters,

02:44.560 --> 02:48.720
just having medical knowledge is not good enough.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.800
In order to do this work properly, you have to know what the international standards are

02:52.800 --> 02:54.920
for giving humanitarian aid.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.240
You have to know not only the medical side, but how to give food and how to give clean

02:59.240 --> 03:01.960
water and how to give proper shelter.

03:01.960 --> 03:07.580
And those guidelines are already written down in something called the Sphere Standards.

03:07.580 --> 03:12.260
Within its 406 pages, the Sphere Handbook has specific guidelines like that everyone

03:12.260 --> 03:16.720
needs 15 liters of water per day, that a single hand pump at a flow rate of 17 liters per

03:16.720 --> 03:20.800
minute can act as the water source for up to 500 people, it gives a clear step-by-step

03:20.800 --> 03:26.540
guide to establishing a goods delivery system, it defines that, in an emergency shelter situation,

03:26.540 --> 03:30.780
everyone should have at least 38 square feet or 3.5 square meters of living space but that,

03:30.780 --> 03:35.340
in cold climates, that should be increased to 48 square feet or 4.5 square meters.

03:35.340 --> 03:39.700
It takes out as much of the guesswork and humanitarian response as possible.

03:39.700 --> 03:44.260
This is what much of the work by academics like Stephanie and Mike is—developing standards

03:44.260 --> 03:49.940
and frameworks before a disaster happens so that, as much as possible, when disaster strikes,

03:49.940 --> 03:53.380
people don't need to think, they just need to do.

03:53.380 --> 03:57.940
This response does, of course, though, vary depending on the nature of the disaster.

03:57.940 --> 04:04.980
An earthquake tends to cause a lot of death immediately and also a lot of heavy injuries

04:04.980 --> 04:07.780
like fractures or head injuries.

04:07.780 --> 04:13.500
They are intensive—they require intensive medical care and surgical care.

04:13.500 --> 04:19.700
They overwhelm the hospital structures as well and so the immediate needs for a place

04:19.700 --> 04:27.540
like Haiti, for example, are surgeons and people who could manage emergency wound care

04:27.540 --> 04:33.100
and even things like dialysis or things like that, that these crush injuries happen.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.900
And they also require a lot of rehabilitation.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.280
Let's take another example of, say, a flood, right?

04:39.280 --> 04:43.180
A flood can be amazingly devastating, move people out of their house, even sweep people

04:43.180 --> 04:44.340
away.

04:44.340 --> 04:50.420
A flood or a hurricane kills people but doesn't necessarily leave a lot of injured people.

04:50.420 --> 04:55.340
So at the end, after people have died from a massive flood or a hurricane, what's left

04:55.340 --> 05:00.800
are people who have minor injuries, maybe, but they don't really overwhelm the surgical

05:00.800 --> 05:02.060
structures of a hospital.

05:02.060 --> 05:05.100
What they overwhelm is the public health.

05:05.100 --> 05:10.060
In an ideal world, the level of humanitarian aid given would be determined by the actual

05:10.060 --> 05:13.500
need, but in reality, this is often not the case.

05:13.500 --> 05:18.420
The reality is that often, but not always, the more accessible a disaster site is, the

05:18.420 --> 05:20.560
more response it gets.

05:20.560 --> 05:24.700
What that means is that, because Haiti was so close to the US, where many humanitarian

05:24.700 --> 05:29.420
organizations are based, it was quite easy for them to mobilize after this earthquake

05:29.420 --> 05:33.700
so Haiti got large numbers of responders quite quickly, but this principle can also leave

05:33.700 --> 05:36.760
other countries without the help they need.

05:36.760 --> 05:40.460
So take, for example, around the same time as the Haiti earthquake, there was a massive

05:40.460 --> 05:45.700
flood in Pakistan, but it was very remote and very difficult to get to.

05:45.700 --> 05:49.820
So the difference in the responders is entirely different.

05:49.820 --> 05:54.940
The only people that could respond in this distant area of Pakistan for this massive

05:54.940 --> 06:00.780
flood were the major organizations that had lifting capacity and they could fly planes

06:00.780 --> 06:05.260
in and they could land personnel in in the middle of someplace that's very remote.

06:05.260 --> 06:10.380
Haiti, on the other hand, received a massive response, especially in comparison by smaller

06:10.380 --> 06:13.940
organizations, given the proximity to the US, and also given the fact that individuals

06:13.940 --> 06:17.980
in the US were particularly motivated to donate given the proximity.

06:17.980 --> 06:23.020
Through NGOs and charities, Americans contributed about $4 billion to the relief effort in the

06:23.020 --> 06:24.860
first three months.

06:24.860 --> 06:31.080
Therefore, the real issue in Haiti was not getting a response—it was managing the response.

06:31.080 --> 06:35.360
Because of that accessibility from the US, a huge number of less professional responders

06:35.360 --> 06:40.320
showed up, and in order to be effective, these responders needed a high degree of management

06:40.320 --> 06:44.720
from the professionals who did show up and were practiced on the international standards.

06:44.720 --> 06:48.900
In addition, there was the issue of actually getting all these responders and their supplies

06:48.900 --> 06:50.400
there.

06:50.400 --> 06:55.440
In the case of Haiti, it's an island nation, so a lot of the heavy things like fuel have

06:55.440 --> 06:57.360
to come in by ship.

06:57.360 --> 07:03.320
But the earthquake severely damaged the port in Port-au-Prince, and because the gas stations

07:03.320 --> 07:08.800
with their underground tanks had also been damaged, the relief community couldn't use

07:08.800 --> 07:13.000
the fuel from those tanks without ruining the engines in their cars and shutting down

07:13.000 --> 07:14.700
all the trucks.

07:14.700 --> 07:21.300
And so there was a big fuel crisis early on, and that meant it was hard to transport things.

07:21.300 --> 07:25.820
So while we were waiting for the port to be fixed, a lot of the supplies had to be flown

07:25.820 --> 07:33.660
in, either on airplanes that were landing at the Port-au-Prince airport, or overland

07:33.660 --> 07:36.060
from the Dominican Republic.

07:36.060 --> 07:41.300
In the early days of the response, both of these methods had their own unique difficulties.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.260
Coming from the Dominican Republic, many of these roads were damaged, destroyed, or covered

07:45.260 --> 07:48.580
in debris, so that was quite a slow option.

07:48.580 --> 07:53.140
The airport therefore stood alone as the only high-speed link between Haiti and the world,

07:53.140 --> 07:56.900
serving as the only route in for all the most time-sensitive supplies.

07:56.900 --> 08:01.420
In the initial 24 hours after the earthquake, Port-au-Prince's airport saw chaos as flights

08:01.420 --> 08:05.420
poured in with no direction into an airport with essentially no control.

08:05.420 --> 08:09.420
The first semblance of control came the morning after the quake, when the US Coast Guard Cutter

08:09.420 --> 08:13.860
Forward pulled into Port-au-Prince and just hours later started working as the airport's

08:13.860 --> 08:15.780
air traffic control from the ship.

08:15.780 --> 08:19.740
The airport's own air traffic control tower was badly damaged in the quake, so it was

08:19.740 --> 08:21.480
far from operational.

08:21.480 --> 08:26.180
Soon after, that same afternoon, a team of US Air Force airmen landed at the airport

08:26.180 --> 08:29.020
and assumed responsibility for its air traffic control.

08:29.020 --> 08:33.540
Their operation was made up of, quite literally, a bunch of folding tables and handheld radios

08:33.540 --> 08:36.960
set up at the end of the runway as they guided flights in.

08:36.960 --> 08:41.360
With this setup, they handled up to almost 200 planes a day despite the fact that on

08:41.360 --> 08:45.680
a normal day the airport receives no more than a dozen commercial flights.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.840
Eventually, Haiti officially handed control of the airport over to the US, meaning the

08:49.840 --> 08:54.040
Americans could settle in and set up formally for the long haul, and a team from the American

08:54.040 --> 08:58.340
FAA came down to take control as they set up a portable, temporary air traffic control

08:58.340 --> 08:59.340
tower.

08:59.340 --> 09:03.780
Of course, even working at full capacity, there was still an enormous backlog at this

09:03.780 --> 09:07.820
small airport, leading them to set up a system where flights would be prioritized based off

09:07.820 --> 09:12.620
what they carried with the highest demand humanitarian goods being allowed in first.

09:12.620 --> 09:16.680
Of course, even once you get a plane with supplies on the ground, getting those supplies

09:16.680 --> 09:20.960
to those in need is not a given because, in between the runway and the roads, there

09:20.960 --> 09:23.960
is, of course, customs.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.560
Often what happens is that the national government of the place where the disaster has happened

09:28.560 --> 09:35.180
has a way of sort of relaxing customs efforts for relief supplies coming in and trying to

09:35.180 --> 09:40.140
fast-forward them through, but that doesn't always happen, especially with medical supplies,

09:40.140 --> 09:46.420
which can include power for painkillers that might be particularly regulated by a government.

09:46.420 --> 09:52.520
And so, a lot of times aid agencies will face a backlog in their relief supplies coming

09:52.520 --> 09:55.000
in as they get sort of stuck in customs.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.240
Eventually, though, once a solid supply chain is set up, responders can actually get to

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
work.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.600
Stephanie and Mike, of course, work to set up that field hospital to start treating all

10:04.600 --> 10:06.880
the most severe injuries from the earthquake.

10:06.880 --> 10:10.740
While the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, who they both work for, doesn't typically

10:10.740 --> 10:16.400
itself actually respond on the ground to disasters, they did exceptionally in this case and, as

10:16.400 --> 10:21.740
the literal experts in this sort of activity, they were able to set up a stellar operation.

10:21.740 --> 10:27.980
As experts, they knew, once again, that doctors by themselves aren't necessarily useful.

10:27.980 --> 10:32.660
Doctors are useful when placed where they're needed and so, the first step was to identify

10:32.660 --> 10:33.980
what was needed.

10:33.980 --> 10:41.960
So, in the Haiti response, the HHI team identified one major gap in particular and that was the

10:41.960 --> 10:48.060
lack of rehabilitation resources for patients that had big operations like orthopedic operations

10:48.060 --> 10:53.780
but had nowhere to go because there was no place to admit them and to rehabilitate them.

10:53.780 --> 10:58.060
Therefore, the hospital had its focus and everything could go from there.

10:58.060 --> 11:02.340
Again, because of the specific nature of the disaster, the team knew that they couldn't

11:02.340 --> 11:05.020
set up their temporary hospital just anywhere.

11:05.020 --> 11:09.780
After an earthquake in particular, when the people who've been injured in the earthquake

11:09.780 --> 11:16.940
have seen all the buildings around them fall down, they do not want to go into another

11:16.940 --> 11:21.400
building because there are a lot of aftershocks afterwards and they're afraid that these buildings

11:21.400 --> 11:25.600
might have been damaged and that they might fall down and either kill them or cause more

11:25.600 --> 11:31.660
injury and that is a very reasonable fear and so, even though the place where we were

11:31.660 --> 11:37.760
working had buildings that were very strong and very well able to sustain all the aftershocks

11:37.760 --> 11:44.360
with little or no damage, the people we were helping were too afraid to go inside them.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.680
The hospital therefore had to be almost entirely built out of tents.

11:48.680 --> 11:53.400
Despite the focus on acting as a rehabilitation center, the hospital did, however, still perform

11:53.400 --> 11:58.480
surgery and therefore they needed a super-sterile environment to prevent infection or contamination

11:58.480 --> 11:59.480
during surgery.

11:59.480 --> 12:04.840
That's quite tough to create in a series of tents so they used two solutions for this.

12:04.920 --> 12:11.800
One, the easier way, was we had operating theater trucks.

12:11.800 --> 12:18.040
So imagine a big delivery truck that you can open the doors and instead of finding boxes

12:18.040 --> 12:21.640
inside, you find an OR or an operating theater.

12:21.640 --> 12:26.700
We had a couple of those and that was very useful because they come already sealed.

12:26.700 --> 12:32.960
A lot of our surgeries though, we had to do in what were classrooms in a school in Haiti

12:33.120 --> 12:40.400
and what we had to do there was to actually tape up sheets over the windows, plastic sheeting,

12:40.400 --> 12:45.560
to make sure that no insects or dust would come from the outside while we were doing

12:45.560 --> 12:49.560
the surgeries so that we could make it a sterile and safe place to do them.

12:49.560 --> 12:54.420
Of course, the goal of responding to humanitarian disasters is to get the humanitarian disaster

12:54.420 --> 12:59.100
to end, so that means there also has to be focus on the exit strategy.

12:59.380 --> 13:05.600
When a disaster happens and we go in and start working, even from the first day, we're always

13:05.600 --> 13:08.600
thinking about the day we're going to leave.

13:08.600 --> 13:12.500
What that means is we do a number of things right from the start.

13:12.500 --> 13:17.840
In Haiti, for example, we wanted to make sure that as we were caring for people's wounds,

13:17.840 --> 13:22.100
we were teaching the local doctors and nurses that we were working with how to do that kind

13:22.100 --> 13:25.660
of care if they weren't already familiar with it so that when we left, they would be able

13:25.660 --> 13:28.060
to easily carry that forward.

13:28.060 --> 13:32.300
Getting to that finale—when the agencies pull out, when a country is back to normal,

13:32.300 --> 13:37.320
once life goes on as normal after a disaster—is a delicate science that doesn't always go

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
to plan.

13:38.320 --> 13:43.620
No matter how many frameworks, handbooks, and guidelines one has, a disaster is a disaster

13:43.620 --> 13:45.980
and does not follow plans.

13:45.980 --> 13:50.020
The role of all the planning and preparation, though, is to provide structure where there

13:50.020 --> 13:51.220
is none.

13:51.220 --> 13:54.960
People like Stephanie and Mike spend their entire career studying and educating others

13:54.960 --> 13:59.840
on this field since certain help is certainly better than other help and, in a case when

13:59.840 --> 14:05.800
the worst has happened, only the best help is enough.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.540
Working in disaster response clearly requires that your problem solving and critical thinking

14:09.540 --> 14:11.880
skills are quick and accurate.

14:11.880 --> 14:16.080
Those skills, in fact, are crucial fundamental skills for life that can help with school,

14:16.080 --> 14:20.320
employment, and much more, both of which can be developed with Brilliant's courses.

14:20.320 --> 14:24.180
Really all of their courses will help with problem solving and critical thinking skills,

14:24.180 --> 14:27.980
but a few that can especially help are their probability and logic courses.

14:27.980 --> 14:32.980
Luckily, both probability and logic are fascinating fields and Brilliant takes you all the way

14:32.980 --> 14:37.520
from the basic to the advanced in these fields with their intuitive, superbly designed courses

14:37.520 --> 14:41.440
that break complex topics into manageable, intuitive principles.
