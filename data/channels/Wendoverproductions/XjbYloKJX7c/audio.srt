00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
seven.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,280
To, from, or through China, more than half a billion passengers fly each year.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,620
By 2035, that number is expected to be 1.3 billion.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,640
It is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world, is home to what is believed

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,200
to be the future busiest airport in the world, and is expected to soon surpass the US to

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,720
become the single largest aviation market in the world.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,640
Last year, a new aircraft was delivered to a Chinese airline every 21 hours.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,960
That's $35 billion dollars worth of aircraft purchased in a single year.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,320
All of this, however, represents a considerable problem for the world's largest aircraft

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,320
manufacturer—Boeing.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,200
You see, the reason China is a problem for Boeing is also part of the reason why China

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,560
is already such an enormous market for them.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,840
While the US is resoundingly Boeing's number one customer, at least partially propped up

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,280
by government defense contracts, China safely holds the number two spot.

17
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,520
Excluding North America, China, in fact, single-handedly earns Boeing more money than every continent

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
in the world.

19
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,000
Now, not only is China a fierce battleground between Boeing and Airbus, even if Boeing

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,560
has a slight overall edge in market share, but the company now also faces a trifecta

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,160
of issues potentially hindering its future dominance in this ultimately crucial aviation

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,360
market.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,960
The first of these issues has to do with Boeing's brand new, yet beleaguered airplane—the

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,800
737 MAX.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,280
Prior to the MAX's grounding, China was, by a wide margin, the largest operator of

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,500
this airplane.

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,440
Its airlines had a total of 97 MAXs while US airlines, representing the second largest

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,840
customer group, only had a total of 72.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
This is an aircraft particularly well suited to China's geography.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,880
With a number of smaller, secondary, or tertiary cities, China's airlines are increasingly

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,300
focused on developing non-stop flights bypassing the major hubs of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou,

32
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,080
or flights to lower demand cities outside of China.

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,120
This is especially true given the huge number of smaller airlines operating in China who

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,640
have established themselves by setting up hubs in some of the country's smaller cities

35
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,040
whose populations more recently started the transition into the country's middle and

36
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,100
upper classes than those of the country's tier one cities.

37
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,840
Of course, flying to or from these smaller cities means lower demand for seats, however,

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,920
the longer range, smaller capacity capability of the 737 MAX perfectly suits this mission.

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,920
That allowed Chinese airlines to set up, in an economical manner, flights like Jinan to

40
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,080
Singapore, Guangzhou to Lahore, Arunchi to Bangkok, or Hangzhou to Hotan—all five or

41
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,520
six hour flights with minimal demand.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,620
The 737 MAX was an aircraft perfectly suited for China and Boeing knew it.

43
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,500
This suitability and focus was demonstrated by Boeing's decision to set up an aircraft

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,920
completion center in Zhoushan, China.

45
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,720
While aircraft would continue to be primarily assembled in rent in Washington, they would

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,020
be flown over to Zhoushan without the interiors completed.

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,120
In Zhoushan, their seats, overhead bins, and basically the entire rest of their interiors

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
would be installed by Chinese workers in this Chinese factory.

49
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
Having a ground presence in China would appease the government, and by extension airlines,

50
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,240
and the hope was that this would help convince them to buy Boeing jets considering that their

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,560
purchase provided Chinese jobs.

52
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,540
This was especially necessary considering that Airbus already had an even more extensive

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,600
final assembly line in the country for its competing A320 jets.

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,900
Given the MAX's suitability, though, Chinese airlines bought an enormous number of these

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,900
planes.

56
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,100
In addition to the 97 already delivered, Chinese airlines had almost 500 of them on order but

57
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,340
then, of course, the MAX crashed, and then it crashed again.

58
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,580
China's Civil Aviation Administration, eager to maintain the country's recent streak

59
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,360
of aviation safety, quickly grounded the MAX after its second crash making China the first

60
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,840
country to do so.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
This was a rather shocking move as historically, every country's aviation regulator more

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,360
or less just followed the lead of the American FAA in these decisions.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,960
It was thought that, if the FAA said it was safe, it was safe and in this case, the FAA

64
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,920
initially asserted their confidence in Boeing's 737 MAX and chose not to ground it immediately.

65
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,520
Now, in the aftermath of this, the grounding of the MAX has presented Beijing with three

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
gifts.

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,860
First, especially in the case of the state-owned airlines and leasing companies, the Chinese

68
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,160
have a much stronger negotiating position than before with Boeing as the company works

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,420
to regain the momentum it had before.

70
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,940
Prices, which typically vary widely from airline to airline and deal to deal, could end up

71
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,940
lower.

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,840
Secondly, China's three largest airlines, which are all state-owned, are asking Boeing

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,680
for compensation for the grounding of their jets.

74
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,920
By extension, this is essentially the Chinese government, the very one that holds the keys

75
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:44,200
to the Chinese aviation market, asking Boeing for compensation and, if Boeing doesn't

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,280
try in what is possibly largely a symbolic move, the Chinese government could decide

77
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,400
to reduce future Boeing orders, potentially in favor of Airbus.

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,100
While Boeing is seemingly setting itself up to offer compensation to airlines affected

79
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,560
by the MAX's grounding, whatever it gives to the Chinese airlines, however favorable

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,240
the company is with them, they will have to match this precedent for their compensation

81
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
with every other of the world's affected airlines.

82
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,520
What could end up the most formidable MAX challenge, though, is that the Chinese aviation

83
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,080
regulator has now established itself as a leader.

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,320
It was them who made the first decision to ground the jet that started the domino effect

85
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,200
of other national regulators grounding the MAX.

86
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,720
Considering China's regulator has now successfully flexed their muscle in this space, the American

87
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,700
FAA, which has deep links to Boeing and has allowed Boeing to essentially self-certify

88
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,660
certain aspects of their new aircraft, has lost some prowess in its role as, in a sense,

89
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,560
the world's aviation regulator.

90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,380
Therefore, not only will China's regulator likely take a more independent route in recertifying

91
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,080
the MAX once its issues are resolved, it will also possibly feel free to make its own independent

92
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,260
decisions on the airworthiness of future aircraft.

93
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,200
This is a precedent that should have Boeing concerned.

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,960
Now, a smaller but significant second issue for Boeing is the ongoing trade war between

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,480
the US and China.

96
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,860
While Boeing has not yet encountered clear implications from this trade war, some speculate

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,080
that the company could be used as a pawn.

98
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,780
You see, China's three largest airlines—China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China—are

99
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,920
all majority-government owned and therefore their orders can be used as a sort of political

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
tool.

101
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,700
To date, these three airlines' fleets are slightly weighted towards Airbus planes, despite

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,360
the country's airlines as a whole on average having a slight preference towards Boeing,

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,340
but they still do operate a significant number of Boeing planes.

104
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,680
While Boeing is not, of course, a state-owned company, they are the US's largest exporter

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,760
and a major American employer and therefore the US government and Department of Commerce

106
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,700
works hard to prop them up.

107
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,080
As the largest international market for Boeing, China has the keys to either help or hurt

108
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,640
America's economy through how many planes it decides to order.

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,880
In the height of the US-China trade war, in March 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,600
a massive $35 billion order of 300 Airbus aircraft by China's state-owned aircraft

111
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,600
leasing company.

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,840
While you can never know for sure, this certainly was viewed as a move at least partially intended

113
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,200
to send a message to the US.

114
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,160
Meanwhile, since the beginning of the trade war, there has been a noticeable lack of significant

115
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,520
Boeing aircraft orders by Chinese airlines.

116
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,640
These however, are most all fairly short-term threats.

117
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,880
The trade war will pass, the 737 MAX will take the skies again, and what is perhaps

118
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,720
Boeing's largest problem is still to come.

119
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,360
Their largest threat is that China is building their very own plane.

120
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,560
It's being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMEC.

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,320
Now, to recap, in the commercial jet aircraft manufacturing space, there's of course Boeing

122
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,720
and Airbus, then there's Embraer, which is a joint venture with Boeing, and Bombardier,

123
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,000
whose flagship program was bought by Airbus.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,560
Therefore, Boeing and Airbus control an enormous majority of the industry.

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,100
Aside from that, the only major unaligned aircraft series is the Bombardier CRJ regional

126
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,680
jet whose manufacturing rights are in the process of being bought by Mitsubishi.

127
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,360
There's then the Russian United Aircraft Corporation producing a small number of Aleutian,

128
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
Tupolev, and Sukhoi jets, and an even smaller number of commercial jets being produced by

129
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,200
the Ukrainian Antonov company.

130
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,700
These Russian and Ukrainian aircraft tend to be mostly bought and operated by Russian

131
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,840
and Ukrainian airlines, so in terms of global aircraft competition against Boeing and Airbus,

132
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,500
there really is none.

133
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,280
It is the textbook duopoly.

134
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,240
COMEC, however, could break that.

135
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
It may surprise some to hear that there are already COMEC aircraft flying in China's

136
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,720
skies—the ARJ-21.

137
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,520
This small, 78-passenger jet was COMEC's first significant foray into commercial aircraft

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,780
manufacturing and it has been, to put it bluntly, a disaster.

139
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:41,200
When it was first announced in 2002, the aircraft was supposed to take the skies in 2005.

140
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,060
In reality, though, the first prototype wasn't completed until 2007, the first test flight

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,640
didn't happen until 2008, and then after delay upon delay upon delay, the first commercial

142
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,520
flight didn't happen until 2016.

143
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,680
Since then, the issues have not let up—the aircraft was plagued with reliability and

144
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,240
capability issues and, to date, only 14 are in commercial service.

145
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,480
Now, it would be quite reasonable to question why this aircraft could threaten Boeing, especially

146
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,640
considering that Boeing doesn't even develop an aircraft in a similar size to the ARJ-21.

147
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,560
The answer is that it doesn't.

148
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,580
The aircraft that should make Boeing nervous is this—the COMEC C919.

149
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,720
Worth noting is that Boeing is actually in a joint venture with COMEC for its final delivery

150
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,000
plant in Xoshan, but that certainly doesn't stop the companies from competing.

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,060
Just by looking at this plane, you can tell it's built to compete directly with Airbus'

152
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,140
A320 and Boeing's 737.

153
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,500
It's designed to carry pretty much the exact same number of passengers, and it even uses

154
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,100
the same engines as the A320neo and 737 MAX, but let's be clear, the C919 is not the

155
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,820
A320 or 737.

156
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,260
It's a brand new aircraft by a brand new aircraft manufacturer, and it's abnormal

157
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,800
for even Airbus or Boeing's new aircraft introductions to go smoothly.

158
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,180
Designing aircraft is difficult.

159
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,800
The C919 is still in its testing phase so its true performance and reliability statistics

160
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,140
are not yet verifiably known, however, in all honesty, the success of this plane has

161
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,780
less to do with its actual capability than probably any other plane in the world.

162
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:20,740
The success of this plane has to do with whether the Chinese government decides it

163
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,540
will be successful.

164
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:28,180
Of China's eight largest airlines, just one, Hainan Airlines, is not government owned.

165
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,900
China's government holds the keys to hundreds or thousands of aircraft orders.

166
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,940
Why would it order from anyone but itself?

167
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,580
Unsurprisingly, quite a few of the C919's orders to date have come from Chinese state

168
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,100
owned airlines and aircraft leasing companies.

169
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,020
Its only non-Chinese order came from GE's aircraft leasing division—possibly as a

170
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,260
vote of confidence considering the C919 uses GE engines.

171
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,260
The real test on whether the C919 is actually a good plane will come once it enters commercial

172
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,900
service, its reliability and capability is exhibited to the world, and foreign airlines

173
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,280
consider whether they want to order it.

174
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,420
With China's expertise in low-cost, high-tech manufacturing, it could possibly prove a low-cost

175
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,800
alternative to the A320 or 737 which has had some airlines intrigued—most visibly

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,860
Ryanair who's CEO said he would be seriously interested in the aircraft if a 200 seat variant

177
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,980
was developed.

178
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,240
China also has increasing geopolitical power, especially in pockets of Africa which also

179
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,520
have fast-developing aviation markets, and this could translate to a number of politically

180
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,220
aligned countries choosing to buy and operate Comac planes.

181
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,780
Overall, the real challenge to Boeing is the opportunity.

182
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,260
If they missed the opportunity to become a dominant player in the world's future

183
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,940
largest aviation market, they could have trouble maintaining their position as the world's

184
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,900
largest aircraft manufacturer.

185
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,340
Being number one means that staying number one is the expectation, not the goal, and

186
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,700
so the Chinese market, while it is an opportunity, is also a requirement.

187
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,500
Now, in a similar vein, anyone who's been number one in anything knows that staying

188
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,140
there requires continuous improvement.

189
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,220
It means that no matter if you're at the beginning of your career or if you're already

190
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,220
at the top, you know that you should be constantly improving yourself.

191
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,660
Part of the way that I make sure I'm always doing this is by using Skillshare.

192
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,960
Their courses are a great way to quickly and simply learn new skills.

193
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,740
For example, for anyone that has to do presentations, whether it be at school or work, I'd highly

194
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,180
recommend the Skillshare original called, Presentation Essentials—How to Share Ideas

195
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,460
that Inspire Action.

196
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,020
Presentation seems like a simple thing, but there are actually so many nuances to it that

197
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,180
can really make the difference between an ineffective and effective presentation.

198
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,700
This is just one of the more than 25,000 classes you can take with Skillshare, all of which

199
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,020
you can access for free for two months by signing up at skl.sh slash wendover7, and

200
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,180
then, after that, their annual pricing works out to less than $10 a month.
