8960	9960	seven.
9960	16280	To, from, or through China, more than half a billion passengers fly each year.
16280	20620	By 2035, that number is expected to be 1.3 billion.
20620	24640	It is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world, is home to what is believed
24640	29200	to be the future busiest airport in the world, and is expected to soon surpass the US to
29200	32720	become the single largest aviation market in the world.
32720	37640	Last year, a new aircraft was delivered to a Chinese airline every 21 hours.
37640	42960	That's $35 billion dollars worth of aircraft purchased in a single year.
42960	47320	All of this, however, represents a considerable problem for the world's largest aircraft
47320	48320	manufacturer—Boeing.
48320	53200	You see, the reason China is a problem for Boeing is also part of the reason why China
53200	55560	is already such an enormous market for them.
55800	59840	While the US is resoundingly Boeing's number one customer, at least partially propped up
59840	64280	by government defense contracts, China safely holds the number two spot.
64280	69520	Excluding North America, China, in fact, single-handedly earns Boeing more money than every continent
69520	70520	in the world.
70520	75000	Now, not only is China a fierce battleground between Boeing and Airbus, even if Boeing
75000	79560	has a slight overall edge in market share, but the company now also faces a trifecta
79560	84160	of issues potentially hindering its future dominance in this ultimately crucial aviation
84160	85360	market.
85360	89960	The first of these issues has to do with Boeing's brand new, yet beleaguered airplane—the
89960	91800	737 MAX.
91800	96280	Prior to the MAX's grounding, China was, by a wide margin, the largest operator of
96280	97500	this airplane.
97500	102440	Its airlines had a total of 97 MAXs while US airlines, representing the second largest
102440	105840	customer group, only had a total of 72.
105840	109280	This is an aircraft particularly well suited to China's geography.
109280	113880	With a number of smaller, secondary, or tertiary cities, China's airlines are increasingly
113880	119300	focused on developing non-stop flights bypassing the major hubs of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou,
119300	122080	or flights to lower demand cities outside of China.
122080	126120	This is especially true given the huge number of smaller airlines operating in China who
126120	129640	have established themselves by setting up hubs in some of the country's smaller cities
129640	133040	whose populations more recently started the transition into the country's middle and
133040	136100	upper classes than those of the country's tier one cities.
136100	140840	Of course, flying to or from these smaller cities means lower demand for seats, however,
140840	146920	the longer range, smaller capacity capability of the 737 MAX perfectly suits this mission.
146920	150920	That allowed Chinese airlines to set up, in an economical manner, flights like Jinan to
150920	156080	Singapore, Guangzhou to Lahore, Arunchi to Bangkok, or Hangzhou to Hotan—all five or
156080	158520	six hour flights with minimal demand.
158520	163620	The 737 MAX was an aircraft perfectly suited for China and Boeing knew it.
163620	167500	This suitability and focus was demonstrated by Boeing's decision to set up an aircraft
167500	169920	completion center in Zhoushan, China.
169920	173720	While aircraft would continue to be primarily assembled in rent in Washington, they would
173720	177020	be flown over to Zhoushan without the interiors completed.
177020	181120	In Zhoushan, their seats, overhead bins, and basically the entire rest of their interiors
181120	184800	would be installed by Chinese workers in this Chinese factory.
184800	189040	Having a ground presence in China would appease the government, and by extension airlines,
189040	192240	and the hope was that this would help convince them to buy Boeing jets considering that their
192240	194560	purchase provided Chinese jobs.
194560	198540	This was especially necessary considering that Airbus already had an even more extensive
198540	202600	final assembly line in the country for its competing A320 jets.
202600	206900	Given the MAX's suitability, though, Chinese airlines bought an enormous number of these
206900	207900	planes.
207900	213100	In addition to the 97 already delivered, Chinese airlines had almost 500 of them on order but
213100	217340	then, of course, the MAX crashed, and then it crashed again.
217340	221580	China's Civil Aviation Administration, eager to maintain the country's recent streak
221580	226360	of aviation safety, quickly grounded the MAX after its second crash making China the first
226360	227840	country to do so.
227840	232560	This was a rather shocking move as historically, every country's aviation regulator more
232560	236360	or less just followed the lead of the American FAA in these decisions.
236360	240960	It was thought that, if the FAA said it was safe, it was safe and in this case, the FAA
240960	245920	initially asserted their confidence in Boeing's 737 MAX and chose not to ground it immediately.
245920	250520	Now, in the aftermath of this, the grounding of the MAX has presented Beijing with three
250520	251520	gifts.
251520	255860	First, especially in the case of the state-owned airlines and leasing companies, the Chinese
255860	260160	have a much stronger negotiating position than before with Boeing as the company works
260160	262420	to regain the momentum it had before.
262420	266940	Prices, which typically vary widely from airline to airline and deal to deal, could end up
266940	267940	lower.
267940	271840	Secondly, China's three largest airlines, which are all state-owned, are asking Boeing
271840	274680	for compensation for the grounding of their jets.
274680	278920	By extension, this is essentially the Chinese government, the very one that holds the keys
278920	284200	to the Chinese aviation market, asking Boeing for compensation and, if Boeing doesn't
284200	288280	try in what is possibly largely a symbolic move, the Chinese government could decide
288280	292400	to reduce future Boeing orders, potentially in favor of Airbus.
292400	296100	While Boeing is seemingly setting itself up to offer compensation to airlines affected
296100	300560	by the MAX's grounding, whatever it gives to the Chinese airlines, however favorable
300560	304240	the company is with them, they will have to match this precedent for their compensation
304240	307280	with every other of the world's affected airlines.
307280	311520	What could end up the most formidable MAX challenge, though, is that the Chinese aviation
311520	315080	regulator has now established itself as a leader.
315080	319320	It was them who made the first decision to ground the jet that started the domino effect
319320	322200	of other national regulators grounding the MAX.
322200	326720	Considering China's regulator has now successfully flexed their muscle in this space, the American
326720	330700	FAA, which has deep links to Boeing and has allowed Boeing to essentially self-certify
330700	335660	certain aspects of their new aircraft, has lost some prowess in its role as, in a sense,
335660	337560	the world's aviation regulator.
337600	342380	Therefore, not only will China's regulator likely take a more independent route in recertifying
342380	347080	the MAX once its issues are resolved, it will also possibly feel free to make its own independent
347080	350260	decisions on the airworthiness of future aircraft.
350260	353200	This is a precedent that should have Boeing concerned.
353200	357960	Now, a smaller but significant second issue for Boeing is the ongoing trade war between
357960	359480	the US and China.
359480	363860	While Boeing has not yet encountered clear implications from this trade war, some speculate
363860	366080	that the company could be used as a pawn.
366080	370780	You see, China's three largest airlines—China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China—are
370780	374920	all majority-government owned and therefore their orders can be used as a sort of political
374920	375920	tool.
375920	379700	To date, these three airlines' fleets are slightly weighted towards Airbus planes, despite
379700	383360	the country's airlines as a whole on average having a slight preference towards Boeing,
383360	387340	but they still do operate a significant number of Boeing planes.
387340	391680	While Boeing is not, of course, a state-owned company, they are the US's largest exporter
391680	395760	and a major American employer and therefore the US government and Department of Commerce
395760	397700	works hard to prop them up.
397700	402080	As the largest international market for Boeing, China has the keys to either help or hurt
402080	405640	America's economy through how many planes it decides to order.
405640	410880	In the height of the US-China trade war, in March 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced
410880	416600	a massive $35 billion order of 300 Airbus aircraft by China's state-owned aircraft
416600	417600	leasing company.
417600	421840	While you can never know for sure, this certainly was viewed as a move at least partially intended
421840	424200	to send a message to the US.
424200	429160	Meanwhile, since the beginning of the trade war, there has been a noticeable lack of significant
429160	432520	Boeing aircraft orders by Chinese airlines.
432520	435640	These however, are most all fairly short-term threats.
435640	439880	The trade war will pass, the 737 MAX will take the skies again, and what is perhaps
439880	442720	Boeing's largest problem is still to come.
442720	446360	Their largest threat is that China is building their very own plane.
446360	450560	It's being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMEC.
450960	455320	Now, to recap, in the commercial jet aircraft manufacturing space, there's of course Boeing
455320	459720	and Airbus, then there's Embraer, which is a joint venture with Boeing, and Bombardier,
459720	462000	whose flagship program was bought by Airbus.
462000	466560	Therefore, Boeing and Airbus control an enormous majority of the industry.
466560	471100	Aside from that, the only major unaligned aircraft series is the Bombardier CRJ regional
471100	474680	jet whose manufacturing rights are in the process of being bought by Mitsubishi.
474680	479360	There's then the Russian United Aircraft Corporation producing a small number of Aleutian,
479360	483280	Tupolev, and Sukhoi jets, and an even smaller number of commercial jets being produced by
483280	485200	the Ukrainian Antonov company.
485200	488700	These Russian and Ukrainian aircraft tend to be mostly bought and operated by Russian
488700	493840	and Ukrainian airlines, so in terms of global aircraft competition against Boeing and Airbus,
493840	495500	there really is none.
495500	497280	It is the textbook duopoly.
497280	500240	COMEC, however, could break that.
500240	504400	It may surprise some to hear that there are already COMEC aircraft flying in China's
504400	506720	skies—the ARJ-21.
506720	511520	This small, 78-passenger jet was COMEC's first significant foray into commercial aircraft
511520	515780	manufacturing and it has been, to put it bluntly, a disaster.
515780	521200	When it was first announced in 2002, the aircraft was supposed to take the skies in 2005.
521200	526060	In reality, though, the first prototype wasn't completed until 2007, the first test flight
526060	531640	didn't happen until 2008, and then after delay upon delay upon delay, the first commercial
531640	534520	flight didn't happen until 2016.
534520	538680	Since then, the issues have not let up—the aircraft was plagued with reliability and
538680	543240	capability issues and, to date, only 14 are in commercial service.
543240	548480	Now, it would be quite reasonable to question why this aircraft could threaten Boeing, especially
548480	553640	considering that Boeing doesn't even develop an aircraft in a similar size to the ARJ-21.
553640	555560	The answer is that it doesn't.
555560	561580	The aircraft that should make Boeing nervous is this—the COMEC C919.
561580	565720	Worth noting is that Boeing is actually in a joint venture with COMEC for its final delivery
565720	570000	plant in Xoshan, but that certainly doesn't stop the companies from competing.
570000	574060	Just by looking at this plane, you can tell it's built to compete directly with Airbus'
574060	576140	A320 and Boeing's 737.
576140	580500	It's designed to carry pretty much the exact same number of passengers, and it even uses
580500	587100	the same engines as the A320neo and 737 MAX, but let's be clear, the C919 is not the
587100	588820	A320 or 737.
589460	594260	It's a brand new aircraft by a brand new aircraft manufacturer, and it's abnormal
594260	598800	for even Airbus or Boeing's new aircraft introductions to go smoothly.
598800	601180	Designing aircraft is difficult.
601180	605800	The C919 is still in its testing phase so its true performance and reliability statistics
605800	611140	are not yet verifiably known, however, in all honesty, the success of this plane has
611140	616780	less to do with its actual capability than probably any other plane in the world.
616780	620740	The success of this plane has to do with whether the Chinese government decides it
620740	622540	will be successful.
622540	628180	Of China's eight largest airlines, just one, Hainan Airlines, is not government owned.
628180	632900	China's government holds the keys to hundreds or thousands of aircraft orders.
632900	635940	Why would it order from anyone but itself?
635940	640580	Unsurprisingly, quite a few of the C919's orders to date have come from Chinese state
640580	643100	owned airlines and aircraft leasing companies.
643100	647020	Its only non-Chinese order came from GE's aircraft leasing division—possibly as a
647020	651260	vote of confidence considering the C919 uses GE engines.
651260	656260	The real test on whether the C919 is actually a good plane will come once it enters commercial
656260	660900	service, its reliability and capability is exhibited to the world, and foreign airlines
660900	663280	consider whether they want to order it.
663280	668420	With China's expertise in low-cost, high-tech manufacturing, it could possibly prove a low-cost
668420	673800	alternative to the A320 or 737 which has had some airlines intrigued—most visibly
673800	678860	Ryanair who's CEO said he would be seriously interested in the aircraft if a 200 seat variant
678860	679980	was developed.
679980	684240	China also has increasing geopolitical power, especially in pockets of Africa which also
684240	688520	have fast-developing aviation markets, and this could translate to a number of politically
688520	692220	aligned countries choosing to buy and operate Comac planes.
692220	695780	Overall, the real challenge to Boeing is the opportunity.
695780	699260	If they missed the opportunity to become a dominant player in the world's future
699260	703940	largest aviation market, they could have trouble maintaining their position as the world's
703940	705900	largest aircraft manufacturer.
705900	710340	Being number one means that staying number one is the expectation, not the goal, and
710340	715700	so the Chinese market, while it is an opportunity, is also a requirement.
715700	720500	Now, in a similar vein, anyone who's been number one in anything knows that staying
720500	723140	there requires continuous improvement.
723140	726220	It means that no matter if you're at the beginning of your career or if you're already
726220	729220	at the top, you know that you should be constantly improving yourself.
729220	733660	Part of the way that I make sure I'm always doing this is by using Skillshare.
733660	737960	Their courses are a great way to quickly and simply learn new skills.
737960	742740	For example, for anyone that has to do presentations, whether it be at school or work, I'd highly
742740	747180	recommend the Skillshare original called, Presentation Essentials—How to Share Ideas
747180	749460	that Inspire Action.
749460	753020	Presentation seems like a simple thing, but there are actually so many nuances to it that
753020	757180	can really make the difference between an ineffective and effective presentation.
757180	761700	This is just one of the more than 25,000 classes you can take with Skillshare, all of which
761700	767020	you can access for free for two months by signing up at skl.sh slash wendover7, and
767020	771180	then, after that, their annual pricing works out to less than $10 a month.
