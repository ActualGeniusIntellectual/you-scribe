00:09.960 --> 00:16.280
To, from, or through China, more than half a billion passengers fly each year.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.620
By 2035, that number is expected to be 1.3 billion.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.640
It is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world, is home to what is believed

00:24.640 --> 00:29.200
to be the future busiest airport in the world, and is expected to soon surpass the US to

00:29.200 --> 00:32.720
become the single largest aviation market in the world.

00:32.720 --> 00:37.640
Last year, a new aircraft was delivered to a Chinese airline every 21 hours.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.960
That's $35 billion dollars worth of aircraft purchased in a single year.

00:42.960 --> 00:47.320
All of this, however, represents a considerable problem for the world's largest aircraft

00:47.320 --> 00:48.320
manufacturer—Boeing.

00:48.320 --> 00:53.200
You see, the reason China is a problem for Boeing is also part of the reason why China

00:53.200 --> 00:55.560
is already such an enormous market for them.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.840
While the US is resoundingly Boeing's number one customer, at least partially propped up

00:59.840 --> 01:04.280
by government defense contracts, China safely holds the number two spot.

01:04.280 --> 01:09.520
Excluding North America, China, in fact, single-handedly earns Boeing more money than every continent

01:09.520 --> 01:10.520
in the world.

01:10.520 --> 01:15.000
Now, not only is China a fierce battleground between Boeing and Airbus, even if Boeing

01:15.000 --> 01:19.560
has a slight overall edge in market share, but the company now also faces a trifecta

01:19.560 --> 01:24.160
of issues potentially hindering its future dominance in this ultimately crucial aviation

01:24.160 --> 01:25.360
market.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.960
The first of these issues has to do with Boeing's brand new, yet beleaguered airplane—the

01:29.960 --> 01:31.800
737 MAX.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.280
Prior to the MAX's grounding, China was, by a wide margin, the largest operator of

01:36.280 --> 01:37.500
this airplane.

01:37.500 --> 01:42.440
Its airlines had a total of 97 MAXs while US airlines, representing the second largest

01:42.440 --> 01:45.840
customer group, only had a total of 72.

01:45.840 --> 01:49.280
This is an aircraft particularly well suited to China's geography.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.880
With a number of smaller, secondary, or tertiary cities, China's airlines are increasingly

01:53.880 --> 01:59.300
focused on developing non-stop flights bypassing the major hubs of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou,

01:59.300 --> 02:02.080
or flights to lower demand cities outside of China.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.120
This is especially true given the huge number of smaller airlines operating in China who

02:06.120 --> 02:09.640
have established themselves by setting up hubs in some of the country's smaller cities

02:09.640 --> 02:13.040
whose populations more recently started the transition into the country's middle and

02:13.040 --> 02:16.100
upper classes than those of the country's tier one cities.

02:16.100 --> 02:20.840
Of course, flying to or from these smaller cities means lower demand for seats, however,

02:20.840 --> 02:26.920
the longer range, smaller capacity capability of the 737 MAX perfectly suits this mission.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.920
That allowed Chinese airlines to set up, in an economical manner, flights like Jinan to

02:30.920 --> 02:36.080
Singapore, Guangzhou to Lahore, Arunchi to Bangkok, or Hangzhou to Hotan—all five or

02:36.080 --> 02:38.520
six hour flights with minimal demand.

02:38.520 --> 02:43.620
The 737 MAX was an aircraft perfectly suited for China and Boeing knew it.

02:43.620 --> 02:47.500
This suitability and focus was demonstrated by Boeing's decision to set up an aircraft

02:47.500 --> 02:49.920
completion center in Zhoushan, China.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.720
While aircraft would continue to be primarily assembled in rent in Washington, they would

02:53.720 --> 02:57.020
be flown over to Zhoushan without the interiors completed.

02:57.020 --> 03:01.120
In Zhoushan, their seats, overhead bins, and basically the entire rest of their interiors

03:01.120 --> 03:04.800
would be installed by Chinese workers in this Chinese factory.

03:04.800 --> 03:09.040
Having a ground presence in China would appease the government, and by extension airlines,

03:09.040 --> 03:12.240
and the hope was that this would help convince them to buy Boeing jets considering that their

03:12.240 --> 03:14.560
purchase provided Chinese jobs.

03:14.560 --> 03:18.540
This was especially necessary considering that Airbus already had an even more extensive

03:18.540 --> 03:22.600
final assembly line in the country for its competing A320 jets.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.900
Given the MAX's suitability, though, Chinese airlines bought an enormous number of these

03:26.900 --> 03:27.900
planes.

03:27.900 --> 03:33.100
In addition to the 97 already delivered, Chinese airlines had almost 500 of them on order but

03:33.100 --> 03:37.340
then, of course, the MAX crashed, and then it crashed again.

03:37.340 --> 03:41.580
China's Civil Aviation Administration, eager to maintain the country's recent streak

03:41.580 --> 03:46.360
of aviation safety, quickly grounded the MAX after its second crash making China the first

03:46.360 --> 03:47.840
country to do so.

03:47.840 --> 03:52.560
This was a rather shocking move as historically, every country's aviation regulator more

03:52.560 --> 03:56.360
or less just followed the lead of the American FAA in these decisions.

03:56.360 --> 04:00.960
It was thought that, if the FAA said it was safe, it was safe and in this case, the FAA

04:00.960 --> 04:05.920
initially asserted their confidence in Boeing's 737 MAX and chose not to ground it immediately.

04:05.920 --> 04:10.520
Now, in the aftermath of this, the grounding of the MAX has presented Beijing with three

04:10.520 --> 04:11.520
gifts.

04:11.520 --> 04:15.860
First, especially in the case of the state-owned airlines and leasing companies, the Chinese

04:15.860 --> 04:20.160
have a much stronger negotiating position than before with Boeing as the company works

04:20.160 --> 04:22.420
to regain the momentum it had before.

04:22.420 --> 04:26.940
Prices, which typically vary widely from airline to airline and deal to deal, could end up

04:26.940 --> 04:27.940
lower.

04:27.940 --> 04:31.840
Secondly, China's three largest airlines, which are all state-owned, are asking Boeing

04:31.840 --> 04:34.680
for compensation for the grounding of their jets.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.920
By extension, this is essentially the Chinese government, the very one that holds the keys

04:38.920 --> 04:44.200
to the Chinese aviation market, asking Boeing for compensation and, if Boeing doesn't

04:44.200 --> 04:48.280
try in what is possibly largely a symbolic move, the Chinese government could decide

04:48.280 --> 04:52.400
to reduce future Boeing orders, potentially in favor of Airbus.

04:52.400 --> 04:56.100
While Boeing is seemingly setting itself up to offer compensation to airlines affected

04:56.100 --> 05:00.560
by the MAX's grounding, whatever it gives to the Chinese airlines, however favorable

05:00.560 --> 05:04.240
the company is with them, they will have to match this precedent for their compensation

05:04.240 --> 05:07.280
with every other of the world's affected airlines.

05:07.280 --> 05:11.520
What could end up the most formidable MAX challenge, though, is that the Chinese aviation

05:11.520 --> 05:15.080
regulator has now established itself as a leader.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.320
It was them who made the first decision to ground the jet that started the domino effect

05:19.320 --> 05:22.200
of other national regulators grounding the MAX.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.720
Considering China's regulator has now successfully flexed their muscle in this space, the American

05:26.720 --> 05:30.700
FAA, which has deep links to Boeing and has allowed Boeing to essentially self-certify

05:30.700 --> 05:35.660
certain aspects of their new aircraft, has lost some prowess in its role as, in a sense,

05:35.660 --> 05:37.560
the world's aviation regulator.

05:37.600 --> 05:42.380
Therefore, not only will China's regulator likely take a more independent route in recertifying

05:42.380 --> 05:47.080
the MAX once its issues are resolved, it will also possibly feel free to make its own independent

05:47.080 --> 05:50.260
decisions on the airworthiness of future aircraft.

05:50.260 --> 05:53.200
This is a precedent that should have Boeing concerned.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.960
Now, a smaller but significant second issue for Boeing is the ongoing trade war between

05:57.960 --> 05:59.480
the US and China.

05:59.480 --> 06:03.860
While Boeing has not yet encountered clear implications from this trade war, some speculate

06:03.860 --> 06:06.080
that the company could be used as a pawn.

06:06.080 --> 06:10.780
You see, China's three largest airlines—China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China—are

06:10.780 --> 06:14.920
all majority-government owned and therefore their orders can be used as a sort of political

06:14.920 --> 06:15.920
tool.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.700
To date, these three airlines' fleets are slightly weighted towards Airbus planes, despite

06:19.700 --> 06:23.360
the country's airlines as a whole on average having a slight preference towards Boeing,

06:23.360 --> 06:27.340
but they still do operate a significant number of Boeing planes.

06:27.340 --> 06:31.680
While Boeing is not, of course, a state-owned company, they are the US's largest exporter

06:31.680 --> 06:35.760
and a major American employer and therefore the US government and Department of Commerce

06:35.760 --> 06:37.700
works hard to prop them up.

06:37.700 --> 06:42.080
As the largest international market for Boeing, China has the keys to either help or hurt

06:42.080 --> 06:45.640
America's economy through how many planes it decides to order.

06:45.640 --> 06:50.880
In the height of the US-China trade war, in March 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced

06:50.880 --> 06:56.600
a massive $35 billion order of 300 Airbus aircraft by China's state-owned aircraft

06:56.600 --> 06:57.600
leasing company.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.840
While you can never know for sure, this certainly was viewed as a move at least partially intended

07:01.840 --> 07:04.200
to send a message to the US.

07:04.200 --> 07:09.160
Meanwhile, since the beginning of the trade war, there has been a noticeable lack of significant

07:09.160 --> 07:12.520
Boeing aircraft orders by Chinese airlines.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.640
These however, are most all fairly short-term threats.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.880
The trade war will pass, the 737 MAX will take the skies again, and what is perhaps

07:19.880 --> 07:22.720
Boeing's largest problem is still to come.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.360
Their largest threat is that China is building their very own plane.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.560
It's being built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or COMEC.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.320
Now, to recap, in the commercial jet aircraft manufacturing space, there's of course Boeing

07:35.320 --> 07:39.720
and Airbus, then there's Embraer, which is a joint venture with Boeing, and Bombardier,

07:39.720 --> 07:42.000
whose flagship program was bought by Airbus.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.560
Therefore, Boeing and Airbus control an enormous majority of the industry.

07:46.560 --> 07:51.100
Aside from that, the only major unaligned aircraft series is the Bombardier CRJ regional

07:51.100 --> 07:54.680
jet whose manufacturing rights are in the process of being bought by Mitsubishi.

07:54.680 --> 07:59.360
There's then the Russian United Aircraft Corporation producing a small number of Aleutian,

07:59.360 --> 08:03.280
Tupolev, and Sukhoi jets, and an even smaller number of commercial jets being produced by

08:03.280 --> 08:05.200
the Ukrainian Antonov company.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.700
These Russian and Ukrainian aircraft tend to be mostly bought and operated by Russian

08:08.700 --> 08:13.840
and Ukrainian airlines, so in terms of global aircraft competition against Boeing and Airbus,

08:13.840 --> 08:15.500
there really is none.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.280
It is the textbook duopoly.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.240
COMEC, however, could break that.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.400
It may surprise some to hear that there are already COMEC aircraft flying in China's

08:24.400 --> 08:26.720
skies—the ARJ-21.

08:26.720 --> 08:31.520
This small, 78-passenger jet was COMEC's first significant foray into commercial aircraft

08:31.520 --> 08:35.780
manufacturing and it has been, to put it bluntly, a disaster.

08:35.780 --> 08:41.200
When it was first announced in 2002, the aircraft was supposed to take the skies in 2005.

08:41.200 --> 08:46.060
In reality, though, the first prototype wasn't completed until 2007, the first test flight

08:46.060 --> 08:51.640
didn't happen until 2008, and then after delay upon delay upon delay, the first commercial

08:51.640 --> 08:54.520
flight didn't happen until 2016.

08:54.520 --> 08:58.680
Since then, the issues have not let up—the aircraft was plagued with reliability and

08:58.680 --> 09:03.240
capability issues and, to date, only 14 are in commercial service.

09:03.240 --> 09:08.480
Now, it would be quite reasonable to question why this aircraft could threaten Boeing, especially

09:08.480 --> 09:13.640
considering that Boeing doesn't even develop an aircraft in a similar size to the ARJ-21.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.560
The answer is that it doesn't.

09:15.560 --> 09:21.580
The aircraft that should make Boeing nervous is this—the COMEC C919.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.720
Worth noting is that Boeing is actually in a joint venture with COMEC for its final delivery

09:25.720 --> 09:30.000
plant in Xoshan, but that certainly doesn't stop the companies from competing.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.060
Just by looking at this plane, you can tell it's built to compete directly with Airbus'

09:34.060 --> 09:36.140
A320 and Boeing's 737.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.500
It's designed to carry pretty much the exact same number of passengers, and it even uses

09:40.500 --> 09:47.100
the same engines as the A320neo and 737 MAX, but let's be clear, the C919 is not the

09:47.100 --> 09:48.820
A320 or 737.

09:49.460 --> 09:54.260
It's a brand new aircraft by a brand new aircraft manufacturer, and it's abnormal

09:54.260 --> 09:58.800
for even Airbus or Boeing's new aircraft introductions to go smoothly.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.180
Designing aircraft is difficult.

10:01.180 --> 10:05.800
The C919 is still in its testing phase so its true performance and reliability statistics

10:05.800 --> 10:11.140
are not yet verifiably known, however, in all honesty, the success of this plane has

10:11.140 --> 10:16.780
less to do with its actual capability than probably any other plane in the world.

10:16.780 --> 10:20.740
The success of this plane has to do with whether the Chinese government decides it

10:20.740 --> 10:22.540
will be successful.

10:22.540 --> 10:28.180
Of China's eight largest airlines, just one, Hainan Airlines, is not government owned.

10:28.180 --> 10:32.900
China's government holds the keys to hundreds or thousands of aircraft orders.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.940
Why would it order from anyone but itself?

10:35.940 --> 10:40.580
Unsurprisingly, quite a few of the C919's orders to date have come from Chinese state

10:40.580 --> 10:43.100
owned airlines and aircraft leasing companies.

10:43.100 --> 10:47.020
Its only non-Chinese order came from GE's aircraft leasing division—possibly as a

10:47.020 --> 10:51.260
vote of confidence considering the C919 uses GE engines.

10:51.260 --> 10:56.260
The real test on whether the C919 is actually a good plane will come once it enters commercial

10:56.260 --> 11:00.900
service, its reliability and capability is exhibited to the world, and foreign airlines

11:00.900 --> 11:03.280
consider whether they want to order it.

11:03.280 --> 11:08.420
With China's expertise in low-cost, high-tech manufacturing, it could possibly prove a low-cost

11:08.420 --> 11:13.800
alternative to the A320 or 737 which has had some airlines intrigued—most visibly

11:13.800 --> 11:18.860
Ryanair who's CEO said he would be seriously interested in the aircraft if a 200 seat variant

11:18.860 --> 11:19.980
was developed.

11:19.980 --> 11:24.240
China also has increasing geopolitical power, especially in pockets of Africa which also

11:24.240 --> 11:28.520
have fast-developing aviation markets, and this could translate to a number of politically

11:28.520 --> 11:32.220
aligned countries choosing to buy and operate Comac planes.

11:32.220 --> 11:35.780
Overall, the real challenge to Boeing is the opportunity.

11:35.780 --> 11:39.260
If they missed the opportunity to become a dominant player in the world's future

11:39.260 --> 11:43.940
largest aviation market, they could have trouble maintaining their position as the world's

11:43.940 --> 11:45.900
largest aircraft manufacturer.

11:45.900 --> 11:50.340
Being number one means that staying number one is the expectation, not the goal, and

11:50.340 --> 11:55.700
so the Chinese market, while it is an opportunity, is also a requirement.

11:55.700 --> 12:00.500
Now, in a similar vein, anyone who's been number one in anything knows that staying

12:00.500 --> 12:03.140
there requires continuous improvement.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.220
It means that no matter if you're at the beginning of your career or if you're already

12:06.220 --> 12:09.220
at the top, you know that you should be constantly improving yourself.

12:09.220 --> 12:13.660
Part of the way that I make sure I'm always doing this is by using Skillshare.

12:13.660 --> 12:17.960
Their courses are a great way to quickly and simply learn new skills.

12:17.960 --> 12:22.740
For example, for anyone that has to do presentations, whether it be at school or work, I'd highly

12:22.740 --> 12:27.180
recommend the Skillshare original called, Presentation Essentials—How to Share Ideas

12:27.180 --> 12:29.460
that Inspire Action.

12:29.460 --> 12:33.020
Presentation seems like a simple thing, but there are actually so many nuances to it that

12:33.020 --> 12:37.180
can really make the difference between an ineffective and effective presentation.

12:37.180 --> 12:41.700
This is just one of the more than 25,000 classes you can take with Skillshare, all of which

12:41.700 --> 12:47.020
you can access for free for two months by signing up at skl.sh slash wendover7, and

12:47.020 --> 12:51.180
then, after that, their annual pricing works out to less than $10 a month.
