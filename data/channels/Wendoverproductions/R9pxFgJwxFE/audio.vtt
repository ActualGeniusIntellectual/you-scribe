00:00.560 --> 00:07.440
This is Bancroft. It's a small Iowa town composed of a grocery store, a bank, a liquor store,

00:07.440 --> 00:12.000
hardware store, office supply store, flower shop, hair salon, medical clinic, bed and breakfast,

00:12.000 --> 00:16.240
funeral home, trailer manufacturer, whiskey distillery, gym, baseball field, city pool,

00:16.240 --> 00:20.000
nine-hole golf course, two gas stations, two restaurants, two feed suppliers, two car

00:20.000 --> 00:27.840
dealerships, 346 homes, 699 people, and that's about it. Bancroft more or less nestles into a

00:27.840 --> 00:34.720
single 1x1 mile square, and it's surrounded by eight other 1x1 mile squares—fields full of corn

00:34.720 --> 00:40.560
and soybean. Six squares down, there's another town, Burt. Six to the west, it's Lone Rock,

00:40.560 --> 00:46.320
then six more, and there's Fenton. This consistent human distribution is reflective of these towns'

00:46.320 --> 00:52.160
common cause. They're farm towns. Their economy is the fuels that envelop them, it's the crops

00:52.160 --> 00:56.880
they grow, and so their spacing is dictated by the amount of people that these fields that separate

00:56.880 --> 01:03.280
them can reasonably provide for financially. 974 of these squares combined represent Coseth

01:03.280 --> 01:10.400
County. Of those, a full 355 are dedicated to the cultivation of soybean, while even more,

01:10.400 --> 01:17.840
475, are used to grow corn. Therefore, this county, as large as the country of Luxembourg,

01:17.840 --> 01:25.440
uses some 85% of its area for the singular purpose of growing these two crops. The reason why is

01:25.440 --> 01:31.600
because Coseth County and its neighbors are powerhouses in the world of agriculture—crucial

01:31.600 --> 01:36.720
food production resources not only for Iowa, not only for the United States, not only even just

01:36.720 --> 01:43.520
for North America, but for the entire world. For a farmer living and working, say, here,

01:43.520 --> 01:47.840
a four-mile drive outside of Bancroft on an average-sized farm, the process of feeding the

01:47.840 --> 01:52.560
globe, supporting the American economy, powering the local community, and providing for their own

01:52.640 --> 01:57.280
families starts anew every spring, when they sit down at the kitchen table, flip to April

01:57.280 --> 02:02.000
on their calendar, and decide exactly when and exactly what they're going to plant.

02:02.720 --> 02:11.440
Now, of the 23,195,000 acres planted in Iowa in 2021, 23 million acres were filled with soybean

02:11.440 --> 02:17.280
or corn. It's a safe bet, in other words, that, come April, this farmer will be planting one of

02:17.280 --> 02:23.200
these two major cash crops. Deciding what to plant, however, is not simply an either-or

02:23.200 --> 02:27.280
proposition. Considering that all this land has been planted with corn in years prior,

02:27.280 --> 02:31.120
and that events in other corn-producing regions of the world has this farmer feeling bullish on its

02:31.120 --> 02:36.480
immediate prospects, it's likely that they'll pass on soybean and go with corn. But that's only

02:36.480 --> 02:42.720
the start—now, the farmer has hundreds of viable seed hybrids to choose from. Selective breeding

02:42.720 --> 02:47.600
over millennia and genetic modification in recent decades, after all, are what transformed corn from

02:47.600 --> 02:53.680
this to this—a crop packing enough energy to power combustion engines and America's meat industry

02:53.680 --> 02:59.120
alike. There also would have allowed per-acre corn production to skyrocket over the past century,

02:59.120 --> 03:03.120
as breeding for increased yield, disease resistance, and drought tolerance have

03:03.120 --> 03:08.400
pushed bushel-per-acre yields to levels pre-war Americans could never have even imagined.

03:08.880 --> 03:14.000
For this average Iowa farmer, on this average Iowa farm, though, it's not the path that matters,

03:14.000 --> 03:17.600
but the future, and to ensure they're making the most of the growing season,

03:17.600 --> 03:24.160
they need to nail their seed selection. 99% of corn grown in Iowa isn't the type you eat fresh

03:24.160 --> 03:28.720
off the cob—it's field corn, or the type that goes on to make ethanol in other parts of Iowa,

03:28.720 --> 03:34.800
or feed livestock in Wyoming, or sweeten drinks in Georgia. And still, the options are endless

03:34.800 --> 03:39.920
when it comes to field corn seeds—some hold it better in dry years, others in wet years.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.320
Some produce stronger stalks, others produce larger ears. Some fare better when planted in

03:44.320 --> 03:49.280
untilled soils, others require only minimal fertilizer. Ultimately, though, informing

03:49.280 --> 03:56.320
which seed a farmer chooses largely comes down to one all-important metric—average yield—the

03:56.320 --> 04:01.120
number of bushels each acre can produce. So, to figure out what will make the farmer the most

04:01.120 --> 04:06.480
bushels and therefore the most money, they start here, with the Iowa Crop Improvement Association's

04:06.480 --> 04:11.760
Corn Performance Test. Now, considering Bancroft's less than 30 miles or 50 kilometers from the test

04:11.760 --> 04:16.800
site in Corwith, that the towns sit in the same ICIA north district, and that they both occupy

04:16.800 --> 04:21.840
the same soil region made up of loamy Wisconsin glacial till, it stands to reason that what works

04:21.840 --> 04:27.440
in one spot will work in the other. Grabbing the farmer's eyes first, then, are likely these legacy

04:27.440 --> 04:33.040
and DeKalb seeds, which in 2021, a record-setting year for statewide yields, performed well above

04:33.040 --> 04:38.560
the state average of 205 bushels per acre. Yield is the most important metric, but it's

04:38.560 --> 04:43.840
not the only factor influencing our farmer's choice—the corn's use, the seed's price,

04:43.840 --> 04:48.800
the farmer's past experiences, and brand loyalty all inform that final decision.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.760
Given that DeKalb's hybrid performs so well in an environment so similar to Bancroft's,

04:53.760 --> 04:58.560
and given that Arndorferbro's seed, conveniently located right here in Bancroft, just so happens

04:58.560 --> 05:03.840
to sell DeKalb seeds, all things being equal, it makes sense that this farmer bought the DeKalb

05:03.840 --> 05:10.080
$52.99 RIB or something like it. Or perhaps not—perhaps the farmer considered the weather

05:10.080 --> 05:15.680
outlook for the coming year, and went a different route. You see, while billions of dollars a year

05:15.680 --> 05:20.400
are invested in the creation of these hybrid seeds, and in turn, billions a year are brought

05:20.400 --> 05:25.200
in by the crops these seeds produce, critical junctures of the process revolve entirely around

05:25.200 --> 05:31.600
the farmer's informed and well-tuned intuition. 2022, for example, is a La Niña year—a year

05:31.600 --> 05:35.680
where the winter has been cold and damp, and a year where cold snaps, above-average moisture,

05:35.680 --> 05:40.160
and extreme weather events are bound to continue through spring and summer. Perhaps then, our

05:40.160 --> 05:44.480
farmer, considering the higher likelihood of above-average rainfall and potential flooding,

05:44.480 --> 05:49.920
went with a hybrid seed better suited for damp conditions. Such weather not only informs what

05:50.000 --> 05:54.880
is planted, but when it's planted, too. Using Iowa State Extension estimates,

05:54.880 --> 06:00.080
and assuming our farmer is aiming for maximum yield on their land, seeds for 395 acres will

06:00.080 --> 06:06.800
cost $49,000, while running planting machinery another $4,500. If the farmer plants too early

06:06.800 --> 06:14.000
and loses the crop to a late frost, they're effectively out $55,000. Seed selected,

06:14.000 --> 06:18.480
weather considered, and risk accounted for, sometime during the last week of April and the

06:18.480 --> 06:23.360
1st of May, our farmer attaches their 16-row planter onto a tractor, sets the attachment's

06:23.360 --> 06:29.040
row width and seed depths, fills the fertilizer hopper, and sets out onto the field. For a few

06:29.040 --> 06:34.240
days, machinery that's valued in the mid-six figures will get its only use of the year.

06:34.240 --> 06:38.240
In the coming weeks, as spring gives way to summer, the corn stalks will begin to bolt

06:38.240 --> 06:44.160
skyward, and the work will continue. A poor planting strategy can ruin a farmer's season,

06:44.160 --> 06:49.200
but that doesn't mean a perfect strategy will result in maximum yield either. Throughout the

06:49.200 --> 06:53.200
growing season, from the end of spring to the beginning of fall, much can go wrong,

06:53.200 --> 06:59.200
and much hangs on the farmer's ability to adapt. While no farmer, Iowan, or otherwise can control

06:59.200 --> 07:05.120
the weather, generations of agricultural Americans have done their best to exert at least some agency

07:05.120 --> 07:10.160
over the environment. In Iowa, the most obvious sign of this pursuit is the ever-present, but

07:10.160 --> 07:16.720
easy-to-overlook drainage ditch. While humble in form, these cuts into the countryside are critical,

07:16.720 --> 07:23.600
and our farmer just northwest of Bancroft knows it. Take Mud Creek, for example. For Bancroft

07:23.600 --> 07:29.200
golfers on Hole 2, it's a likely landing spot for an errant drive. For travelers leaving Bancroft on

07:29.200 --> 07:36.080
Highway 169, it offers a brief change of scenery. For our farmer, though, Mud Creek serves as

07:36.160 --> 07:40.880
insurance. You see, while the western US cut ditches and built dams to grow crops in the

07:40.880 --> 07:46.240
desert, Iowans cut ditches to grow crops in wetlands. In Iowa, it's not the lack of rain

07:46.240 --> 07:51.520
that makes farming hard, but its abundance. For our farmer, Mud Creek is the lowest point on the

07:51.520 --> 07:56.640
property, and while it may cut slightly into their acreage, the creek, along with the subterranean

07:56.640 --> 08:01.920
tiles and pipes, drain excess rainfall from the field and insulate the property from crop-killing

08:01.920 --> 08:07.600
stagnant water. Without proper drainage, in a worst-case scenario, sprouting seeds drown,

08:07.600 --> 08:12.800
topsoil runs off, and mud keeps the farmer from even inspecting the damage. In the best-case

08:12.800 --> 08:17.120
scenario, without drainage tiles running below their field, a farmer's yields will be hampered

08:17.120 --> 08:22.480
when the first rainstorm washes away the crop's fertilizer, and along with it, the farmer's yield.

08:22.480 --> 08:26.640
Beyond keeping excess water away from the growing crop, the farmer must also make sure that the

08:26.640 --> 08:31.440
plant has easy access to needed nutrients to ensure quality yields. Beginning when planted

08:31.440 --> 08:34.960
with a starter fertilizer, then reapplied throughout the summer depending on the seed

08:34.960 --> 08:40.640
and soil conditions, a mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are applied to maximize the plant's

08:40.640 --> 08:46.240
growth. In such ideal growing conditions, though, corn stalks aren't the only thing growing on the

08:46.240 --> 08:51.280
farmer's field. Along with proactively applying nutrients as the crop matures, the farmer also

08:51.280 --> 08:57.680
monitors the arrival and spread of weeds and pests. Neither fertilizers nor pesticides are cheap.

08:57.680 --> 09:03.040
According to Iowa State's estimated costs, at a per-acre rate, nitrogen is more expensive than

09:03.040 --> 09:07.680
the seeds it supports, while applying pesticides requires additional machine hours or employing

09:07.680 --> 09:12.960
a pilot to spread the product from above. And yet, the farmer wouldn't dare cut corners at

09:12.960 --> 09:18.400
this stage, as these products are some of modern science's most successful forays into standardizing,

09:18.400 --> 09:24.160
overriding, and protecting against nature's inherent chaos. And so, our farmer further

09:24.160 --> 09:28.960
extends themselves financially as the corn stalks extend themselves vertically.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.440
With the summer behind it and fall weather setting in, it's finally time for our farm,

09:33.440 --> 09:39.440
and all the farms of Iowa, to begin capitalizing on all their work. But exactly when this happens

09:39.440 --> 09:44.880
is not down to the farmers, it's down to the weather. This massive industry collectively

09:44.880 --> 09:49.600
waits in the wings for the world to deliver a long enough stretch of dry days to allow the harvest to

09:49.600 --> 09:55.840
begin—and this doesn't always come easy. In 2018, for example, Cozuth County received more than

09:55.840 --> 09:59.920
double its average precipitation at the start of fall, which made it difficult to get the crop to

09:59.920 --> 10:04.640
its necessary level of dryness, and impossible to get large farm equipment into the fields without

10:04.640 --> 10:09.520
getting stuck in the mud. This slowed down the harvest considerably, and the county saw its worst

10:09.520 --> 10:16.160
corn yields since 2014. Even a day of weather months before can sway the success of the harvest.

10:16.160 --> 10:22.880
In 2020, Iowa suffered an extremely severe August derecho storm. The high winds it brought damaged

10:22.880 --> 10:28.800
the crop, pushing stalks of corn into a severe lean. This leaning crop condition, referred to

10:28.800 --> 10:34.240
as lodged corn, makes it difficult for combine harvesters to capture and process all the plant,

10:34.240 --> 10:40.240
leading to lower yields. Therefore, immediately after the storm, local and regional agriculture

10:40.240 --> 10:44.720
organizations started publishing information on how to adapt standard operating procedures

10:44.720 --> 10:49.760
to this widespread damage. Many farmers took their advice to buy a special attachment for

10:49.760 --> 10:54.880
their combine heads, which helps prop up lodged corn. Iowa State's Integrated Crop Management

10:54.880 --> 10:58.960
Program also recommended harvesting from the direction to which the crop is leaning, lowering

10:58.960 --> 11:03.760
the combine head more than typical, and operating at a lower speed. They even added a suggestion

11:03.760 --> 11:10.080
that farmers call a dedicated 24-7 stress hotline if needed—acknowledging the degree of mental and

11:10.080 --> 11:15.840
emotional impact a less-than-stellar harvest can have on farmers. Given the tiny margins in the

11:15.840 --> 11:19.840
farming industry, the difference between an upright and leaning crop can mean the difference

11:19.840 --> 11:25.600
between a profitable and unprofitable year given its impact on yields. But regardless of field

11:25.600 --> 11:31.200
conditions, the combine harvester's job is the same—it's to take in the crop and process it

11:31.200 --> 11:37.920
down into the grain by itself. Now, the combine harvester is an incredibly influential piece of

11:37.920 --> 11:43.920
machinery—it is single-handedly responsible for much of the progress made in food supply and cost

11:43.920 --> 11:49.760
over the past century. What was once an exceedingly manual process, involving a huge swath of laborers

11:49.760 --> 11:55.600
picking and processing the crop primarily by hand, now occurs in a matter of seconds with a single

11:55.600 --> 12:00.720
human operator. The combine's head orients to a certain height above the ground using a sensor,

12:00.720 --> 12:05.520
and the entire machine auto-steers using another sensor that follows the line of corn.

12:05.520 --> 12:10.000
Meanwhile, the snouts feed the crop to a pair of downward-spinning rotors that pull the plant

12:10.000 --> 12:15.040
through a narrow gap with the ears of corn, given their wider shape, get caught and pulled inward

12:15.040 --> 12:20.160
by gathering chains. Then, the ears are pulled in further by augers to the feedhouse, and fed

12:20.160 --> 12:24.480
through a cylinder that throws the plants back into a series of mechanical processes that separate

12:24.480 --> 12:29.280
the grain from the chuff, the unusable part, and by the end a series of augers and paddles pull

12:29.280 --> 12:34.640
the corn kernels themselves up into the combine's tanks. As the combine harvests, a tractor with a

12:34.640 --> 12:39.120
grain cart pulls alongside it, and the combine lets out its arm and delivers grain into the cart.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.600
Once full, the tractor drives away, while the combine continues harvesting,

12:43.600 --> 12:48.400
and heads to a waiting semi-truck pulling a far larger grain trailer, in which it deposits its

12:48.400 --> 12:53.280
load. The process repeats itself until the trailer is full, at which point the semi drives a couple

12:53.280 --> 12:59.600
miles into Bancroft. Now, a common landmark across nearly all of Iowa's small farming towns

12:59.600 --> 13:05.040
is each community's grain elevator. These are absolutely critical pieces of infrastructure

13:05.040 --> 13:10.720
for the region's economy. Bancroft's, indicative, is operated by the Regional Farmers Co-op,

13:10.720 --> 13:16.320
State Line Cooperative. Upon arrival, a probe is placed into the grain trailer to take a sample

13:16.320 --> 13:22.080
of the corn. That sample is inspected and tested for its moisture content—it has to be below 15%

13:22.080 --> 13:26.400
to ensure mold won't grow during storage, which is especially important since it'll be mixed in with

13:26.400 --> 13:31.520
other farmers' crop. Simultaneously, the truck is weighed to determine how much corn is being

13:31.520 --> 13:36.240
delivered. Then, it pulls forward and a door beneath the trailer opens to pour the grain

13:36.240 --> 13:41.440
through a grate below. Finally, a bucket belt carries the grain to the very top of the elevator,

13:41.440 --> 13:47.360
where it gets deposited into the storage bin. Now the farmers have two primary choices for what

13:47.360 --> 13:51.600
happens next. They could sell their crop immediately to the co-op, in which case they

13:51.600 --> 13:56.960
get paid based on corn's current market rate. However, during the harvest season, market rates

13:56.960 --> 14:01.520
for the crop often dip as it gets flooded with supply, especially recently given a widespread

14:01.520 --> 14:08.000
shortage of grain storage capacity. Therefore, if farmers can store the corn, they often do.

14:08.000 --> 14:12.400
Bancroft's grain elevator charges five cents per month per bushel for the first three months,

14:12.400 --> 14:17.600
then four cents per bushel per month after that, but this cost is typically well worth it.

14:17.600 --> 14:22.720
During 2021's harvest season, for example, market prices were about $5.5 per bushel,

14:22.720 --> 14:30.080
but by spring 2022, they were up to $7.5. The grain market is a global one, and so ebbs and

14:30.080 --> 14:34.720
flows in supply and demand around the world influence how many trucks roll through Bancroft's

14:34.720 --> 14:39.680
streets to pick up a load from their grain elevator on a given day. Once that day does come,

14:39.680 --> 14:43.920
though, if it's not going to a nearby processing facility to be turned into livestock feed or

14:43.920 --> 14:48.080
ethanol, chances are good that a truck in Bancroft is starting a trip three hours east

14:48.080 --> 14:52.480
to La Crosse, Wisconsin. There, it unloads at a small grain elevator on the banks of the

14:52.480 --> 14:57.120
Mississippi River run by Cargill, one of the largest companies in the world which,

14:57.120 --> 15:02.560
among other food-related functions, holds about 25% of the US's grain export market.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.600
Once enough product is aggregated, it's loaded into a series of barges which are then lashed

15:07.600 --> 15:13.040
together and propelled forward by a tugboat. The tug orients the barges south, and then begins a

15:13.040 --> 15:19.440
massive 15-day journey through 19 locks and 1,500 miles or 2,400 kilometers of river.

15:20.000 --> 15:24.800
This transportation method is propped up by the fact that grain is not a very time-sensitive

15:24.800 --> 15:30.400
product. In its dry form it's hardly perishable, and given the huge quantity shipped simultaneously,

15:30.400 --> 15:36.000
few ever have a pressing need for it. Therefore, this exceptionally slow system of barge transport

15:36.000 --> 15:41.520
works fine, and it's certainly the most competitive in terms of cost. Shipping a ton of

15:41.520 --> 15:46.720
grain all the way from St. Louis to New Orleans typically costs less than $20 on a Mississippi

15:46.720 --> 15:53.520
River barge—far less than by truck or rail. In fact, a major reason why America's Corn Belt is

15:53.520 --> 15:58.640
such a competitive agricultural region is its access to this low-cost means of transportation

15:58.640 --> 16:03.760
via the Mississippi River. Other growing areas of the world, confined to high-cost truck or

16:03.760 --> 16:09.280
rail transport, just can't compete against America's industry. The destination for all

16:09.280 --> 16:14.880
these barges is New Orleans. Its prominence as a city has always been and still is linked to its

16:14.880 --> 16:20.160
position at the end of America's most important navigable river. There, the barge from La Crosse

16:20.160 --> 16:25.200
arrives at Cargill's massive New Orleans facility, where the grain enters yet another elevator.

16:25.200 --> 16:30.160
Aggregated with the annual output of countless other farms, the Corn is next loaded onto a large,

16:30.160 --> 16:35.840
ocean-going bulk carrier ship. And then finally, the bulk carrier navigates through the final

16:35.840 --> 16:39.360
twists and turns of the Mississippi River, enters the Gulf of Mexico,

16:39.360 --> 16:43.920
and begins a weeks-long journey to wherever the corn market's demand dictates.

16:45.360 --> 16:49.520
One reason I was excited to cover this topic is because I knew I could get all sorts of

16:49.520 --> 16:54.560
spectacular footage of the cornfields of Iowa from our stock footage provider, Storyblocks.

16:54.560 --> 16:58.640
Quite literally since the very first Wendover video, they've been the first place we go to

16:58.640 --> 17:03.280
find footage, which is why I'm so excited that they're now sponsoring us. As you might know,

17:03.280 --> 17:06.640
most stock footage providers are focused on corporate contracts with massive media

17:06.640 --> 17:11.120
organizations, so when an individual creator comes along, they charge them hundreds of dollars

17:11.120 --> 17:16.880
per clip. Storyblocks, however, is made from the ground up to be the provider for creators.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.960
They offer an unlimited subscription so that you can download and use as much as you need

17:20.960 --> 17:25.520
for an annual price lower than what other providers charge for a clip. Beyond an unlimited

17:25.520 --> 17:30.480
subscription, Storyblocks also offers an entirely royalty-free library, meaning you can use anything

17:30.480 --> 17:35.920
from the library for any commercial or personal use. The library is also demand-driven, making

17:35.920 --> 17:40.240
it so that what's add-in, 4K video, or After Effects and Premiere Pro templates, is of the

17:40.240 --> 17:45.360
most use to you, the creator. And Storyblocks offers more than just footage and templates—they

17:45.360 --> 17:49.360
also provide music, images, sound effects, and more. If you're already a creator or want to

17:49.360 --> 17:53.600
become one, I can tell you from my more than five years of experience as their customer that

17:53.600 --> 17:58.240
Storyblocks is an absolutely critical resource to have. I don't think I know a single full-time

17:58.240 --> 18:02.400
creator that doesn't have a subscription to them. So, click the button on screen or head to

18:02.400 --> 18:08.400
Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
