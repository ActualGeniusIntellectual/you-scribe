1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,440
This is Bancroft. It's a small Iowa town composed of a grocery store, a bank, a liquor store,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,000
hardware store, office supply store, flower shop, hair salon, medical clinic, bed and breakfast,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,240
funeral home, trailer manufacturer, whiskey distillery, gym, baseball field, city pool,

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,000
nine-hole golf course, two gas stations, two restaurants, two feed suppliers, two car

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,840
dealerships, 346 homes, 699 people, and that's about it. Bancroft more or less nestles into a

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,720
single 1x1 mile square, and it's surrounded by eight other 1x1 mile squares—fields full of corn

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,560
and soybean. Six squares down, there's another town, Burt. Six to the west, it's Lone Rock,

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,320
then six more, and there's Fenton. This consistent human distribution is reflective of these towns'

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,160
common cause. They're farm towns. Their economy is the fuels that envelop them, it's the crops

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,880
they grow, and so their spacing is dictated by the amount of people that these fields that separate

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,280
them can reasonably provide for financially. 974 of these squares combined represent Coseth

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,400
County. Of those, a full 355 are dedicated to the cultivation of soybean, while even more,

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,840
475, are used to grow corn. Therefore, this county, as large as the country of Luxembourg,

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,440
uses some 85% of its area for the singular purpose of growing these two crops. The reason why is

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,600
because Coseth County and its neighbors are powerhouses in the world of agriculture—crucial

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,720
food production resources not only for Iowa, not only for the United States, not only even just

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,520
for North America, but for the entire world. For a farmer living and working, say, here,

18
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,840
a four-mile drive outside of Bancroft on an average-sized farm, the process of feeding the

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
globe, supporting the American economy, powering the local community, and providing for their own

20
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,280
families starts anew every spring, when they sit down at the kitchen table, flip to April

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,000
on their calendar, and decide exactly when and exactly what they're going to plant.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:11,440
Now, of the 23,195,000 acres planted in Iowa in 2021, 23 million acres were filled with soybean

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,280
or corn. It's a safe bet, in other words, that, come April, this farmer will be planting one of

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,200
these two major cash crops. Deciding what to plant, however, is not simply an either-or

25
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,280
proposition. Considering that all this land has been planted with corn in years prior,

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,120
and that events in other corn-producing regions of the world has this farmer feeling bullish on its

27
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,480
immediate prospects, it's likely that they'll pass on soybean and go with corn. But that's only

28
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,720
the start—now, the farmer has hundreds of viable seed hybrids to choose from. Selective breeding

29
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,600
over millennia and genetic modification in recent decades, after all, are what transformed corn from

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,680
this to this—a crop packing enough energy to power combustion engines and America's meat industry

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,120
alike. There also would have allowed per-acre corn production to skyrocket over the past century,

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
as breeding for increased yield, disease resistance, and drought tolerance have

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,400
pushed bushel-per-acre yields to levels pre-war Americans could never have even imagined.

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,000
For this average Iowa farmer, on this average Iowa farm, though, it's not the path that matters,

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,600
but the future, and to ensure they're making the most of the growing season,

36
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,160
they need to nail their seed selection. 99% of corn grown in Iowa isn't the type you eat fresh

37
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,720
off the cob—it's field corn, or the type that goes on to make ethanol in other parts of Iowa,

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,800
or feed livestock in Wyoming, or sweeten drinks in Georgia. And still, the options are endless

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,920
when it comes to field corn seeds—some hold it better in dry years, others in wet years.

40
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,320
Some produce stronger stalks, others produce larger ears. Some fare better when planted in

41
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,280
untilled soils, others require only minimal fertilizer. Ultimately, though, informing

42
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,320
which seed a farmer chooses largely comes down to one all-important metric—average yield—the

43
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,120
number of bushels each acre can produce. So, to figure out what will make the farmer the most

44
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,480
bushels and therefore the most money, they start here, with the Iowa Crop Improvement Association's

45
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,760
Corn Performance Test. Now, considering Bancroft's less than 30 miles or 50 kilometers from the test

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,800
site in Corwith, that the towns sit in the same ICIA north district, and that they both occupy

47
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,840
the same soil region made up of loamy Wisconsin glacial till, it stands to reason that what works

48
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,440
in one spot will work in the other. Grabbing the farmer's eyes first, then, are likely these legacy

49
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,040
and DeKalb seeds, which in 2021, a record-setting year for statewide yields, performed well above

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,560
the state average of 205 bushels per acre. Yield is the most important metric, but it's

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,840
not the only factor influencing our farmer's choice—the corn's use, the seed's price,

52
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,800
the farmer's past experiences, and brand loyalty all inform that final decision.

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,760
Given that DeKalb's hybrid performs so well in an environment so similar to Bancroft's,

54
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,560
and given that Arndorferbro's seed, conveniently located right here in Bancroft, just so happens

55
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,840
to sell DeKalb seeds, all things being equal, it makes sense that this farmer bought the DeKalb

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,080
$52.99 RIB or something like it. Or perhaps not—perhaps the farmer considered the weather

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,680
outlook for the coming year, and went a different route. You see, while billions of dollars a year

58
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,400
are invested in the creation of these hybrid seeds, and in turn, billions a year are brought

59
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,200
in by the crops these seeds produce, critical junctures of the process revolve entirely around

60
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,600
the farmer's informed and well-tuned intuition. 2022, for example, is a La Niña year—a year

61
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,680
where the winter has been cold and damp, and a year where cold snaps, above-average moisture,

62
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,160
and extreme weather events are bound to continue through spring and summer. Perhaps then, our

63
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,480
farmer, considering the higher likelihood of above-average rainfall and potential flooding,

64
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,920
went with a hybrid seed better suited for damp conditions. Such weather not only informs what

65
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,880
is planted, but when it's planted, too. Using Iowa State Extension estimates,

66
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,080
and assuming our farmer is aiming for maximum yield on their land, seeds for 395 acres will

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,800
cost $49,000, while running planting machinery another $4,500. If the farmer plants too early

68
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,000
and loses the crop to a late frost, they're effectively out $55,000. Seed selected,

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,480
weather considered, and risk accounted for, sometime during the last week of April and the

70
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,360
1st of May, our farmer attaches their 16-row planter onto a tractor, sets the attachment's

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,040
row width and seed depths, fills the fertilizer hopper, and sets out onto the field. For a few

72
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,240
days, machinery that's valued in the mid-six figures will get its only use of the year.

73
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
In the coming weeks, as spring gives way to summer, the corn stalks will begin to bolt

74
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,160
skyward, and the work will continue. A poor planting strategy can ruin a farmer's season,

75
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,200
but that doesn't mean a perfect strategy will result in maximum yield either. Throughout the

76
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
growing season, from the end of spring to the beginning of fall, much can go wrong,

77
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,200
and much hangs on the farmer's ability to adapt. While no farmer, Iowan, or otherwise can control

78
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,120
the weather, generations of agricultural Americans have done their best to exert at least some agency

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,160
over the environment. In Iowa, the most obvious sign of this pursuit is the ever-present, but

80
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,720
easy-to-overlook drainage ditch. While humble in form, these cuts into the countryside are critical,

81
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,600
and our farmer just northwest of Bancroft knows it. Take Mud Creek, for example. For Bancroft

82
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,200
golfers on Hole 2, it's a likely landing spot for an errant drive. For travelers leaving Bancroft on

83
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:36,080
Highway 169, it offers a brief change of scenery. For our farmer, though, Mud Creek serves as

84
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,880
insurance. You see, while the western US cut ditches and built dams to grow crops in the

85
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,240
desert, Iowans cut ditches to grow crops in wetlands. In Iowa, it's not the lack of rain

86
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,520
that makes farming hard, but its abundance. For our farmer, Mud Creek is the lowest point on the

87
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,640
property, and while it may cut slightly into their acreage, the creek, along with the subterranean

88
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,920
tiles and pipes, drain excess rainfall from the field and insulate the property from crop-killing

89
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,600
stagnant water. Without proper drainage, in a worst-case scenario, sprouting seeds drown,

90
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,800
topsoil runs off, and mud keeps the farmer from even inspecting the damage. In the best-case

91
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
scenario, without drainage tiles running below their field, a farmer's yields will be hampered

92
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,480
when the first rainstorm washes away the crop's fertilizer, and along with it, the farmer's yield.

93
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,640
Beyond keeping excess water away from the growing crop, the farmer must also make sure that the

94
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,440
plant has easy access to needed nutrients to ensure quality yields. Beginning when planted

95
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,960
with a starter fertilizer, then reapplied throughout the summer depending on the seed

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,640
and soil conditions, a mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are applied to maximize the plant's

97
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,240
growth. In such ideal growing conditions, though, corn stalks aren't the only thing growing on the

98
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,280
farmer's field. Along with proactively applying nutrients as the crop matures, the farmer also

99
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,680
monitors the arrival and spread of weeds and pests. Neither fertilizers nor pesticides are cheap.

100
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,040
According to Iowa State's estimated costs, at a per-acre rate, nitrogen is more expensive than

101
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,680
the seeds it supports, while applying pesticides requires additional machine hours or employing

102
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,960
a pilot to spread the product from above. And yet, the farmer wouldn't dare cut corners at

103
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,400
this stage, as these products are some of modern science's most successful forays into standardizing,

104
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:24,160
overriding, and protecting against nature's inherent chaos. And so, our farmer further

105
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,960
extends themselves financially as the corn stalks extend themselves vertically.

106
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,440
With the summer behind it and fall weather setting in, it's finally time for our farm,

107
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,440
and all the farms of Iowa, to begin capitalizing on all their work. But exactly when this happens

108
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,880
is not down to the farmers, it's down to the weather. This massive industry collectively

109
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,600
waits in the wings for the world to deliver a long enough stretch of dry days to allow the harvest to

110
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,840
begin—and this doesn't always come easy. In 2018, for example, Cozuth County received more than

111
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,920
double its average precipitation at the start of fall, which made it difficult to get the crop to

112
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,640
its necessary level of dryness, and impossible to get large farm equipment into the fields without

113
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,520
getting stuck in the mud. This slowed down the harvest considerably, and the county saw its worst

114
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:16,160
corn yields since 2014. Even a day of weather months before can sway the success of the harvest.

115
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,880
In 2020, Iowa suffered an extremely severe August derecho storm. The high winds it brought damaged

116
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,800
the crop, pushing stalks of corn into a severe lean. This leaning crop condition, referred to

117
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,240
as lodged corn, makes it difficult for combine harvesters to capture and process all the plant,

118
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,240
leading to lower yields. Therefore, immediately after the storm, local and regional agriculture

119
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
organizations started publishing information on how to adapt standard operating procedures

120
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,760
to this widespread damage. Many farmers took their advice to buy a special attachment for

121
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
their combine heads, which helps prop up lodged corn. Iowa State's Integrated Crop Management

122
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,960
Program also recommended harvesting from the direction to which the crop is leaning, lowering

123
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,760
the combine head more than typical, and operating at a lower speed. They even added a suggestion

124
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,080
that farmers call a dedicated 24-7 stress hotline if needed—acknowledging the degree of mental and

125
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,840
emotional impact a less-than-stellar harvest can have on farmers. Given the tiny margins in the

126
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,840
farming industry, the difference between an upright and leaning crop can mean the difference

127
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,600
between a profitable and unprofitable year given its impact on yields. But regardless of field

128
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,200
conditions, the combine harvester's job is the same—it's to take in the crop and process it

129
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,920
down into the grain by itself. Now, the combine harvester is an incredibly influential piece of

130
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,920
machinery—it is single-handedly responsible for much of the progress made in food supply and cost

131
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,760
over the past century. What was once an exceedingly manual process, involving a huge swath of laborers

132
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,600
picking and processing the crop primarily by hand, now occurs in a matter of seconds with a single

133
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,720
human operator. The combine's head orients to a certain height above the ground using a sensor,

134
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,520
and the entire machine auto-steers using another sensor that follows the line of corn.

135
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,000
Meanwhile, the snouts feed the crop to a pair of downward-spinning rotors that pull the plant

136
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,040
through a narrow gap with the ears of corn, given their wider shape, get caught and pulled inward

137
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,160
by gathering chains. Then, the ears are pulled in further by augers to the feedhouse, and fed

138
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,480
through a cylinder that throws the plants back into a series of mechanical processes that separate

139
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,280
the grain from the chuff, the unusable part, and by the end a series of augers and paddles pull

140
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,640
the corn kernels themselves up into the combine's tanks. As the combine harvests, a tractor with a

141
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,120
grain cart pulls alongside it, and the combine lets out its arm and delivers grain into the cart.

142
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
Once full, the tractor drives away, while the combine continues harvesting,

143
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,400
and heads to a waiting semi-truck pulling a far larger grain trailer, in which it deposits its

144
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,280
load. The process repeats itself until the trailer is full, at which point the semi drives a couple

145
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,600
miles into Bancroft. Now, a common landmark across nearly all of Iowa's small farming towns

146
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,040
is each community's grain elevator. These are absolutely critical pieces of infrastructure

147
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,720
for the region's economy. Bancroft's, indicative, is operated by the Regional Farmers Co-op,

148
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,320
State Line Cooperative. Upon arrival, a probe is placed into the grain trailer to take a sample

149
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,080
of the corn. That sample is inspected and tested for its moisture content—it has to be below 15%

150
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,400
to ensure mold won't grow during storage, which is especially important since it'll be mixed in with

151
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,520
other farmers' crop. Simultaneously, the truck is weighed to determine how much corn is being

152
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,240
delivered. Then, it pulls forward and a door beneath the trailer opens to pour the grain

153
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,440
through a grate below. Finally, a bucket belt carries the grain to the very top of the elevator,

154
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,360
where it gets deposited into the storage bin. Now the farmers have two primary choices for what

155
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,600
happens next. They could sell their crop immediately to the co-op, in which case they

156
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,960
get paid based on corn's current market rate. However, during the harvest season, market rates

157
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,520
for the crop often dip as it gets flooded with supply, especially recently given a widespread

158
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:08,000
shortage of grain storage capacity. Therefore, if farmers can store the corn, they often do.

159
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,400
Bancroft's grain elevator charges five cents per month per bushel for the first three months,

160
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:17,600
then four cents per bushel per month after that, but this cost is typically well worth it.

161
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,720
During 2021's harvest season, for example, market prices were about $5.5 per bushel,

162
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,080
but by spring 2022, they were up to $7.5. The grain market is a global one, and so ebbs and

163
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,720
flows in supply and demand around the world influence how many trucks roll through Bancroft's

164
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,680
streets to pick up a load from their grain elevator on a given day. Once that day does come,

165
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,920
though, if it's not going to a nearby processing facility to be turned into livestock feed or

166
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,080
ethanol, chances are good that a truck in Bancroft is starting a trip three hours east

167
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,480
to La Crosse, Wisconsin. There, it unloads at a small grain elevator on the banks of the

168
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,120
Mississippi River run by Cargill, one of the largest companies in the world which,

169
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,560
among other food-related functions, holds about 25% of the US's grain export market.

170
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,600
Once enough product is aggregated, it's loaded into a series of barges which are then lashed

171
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,040
together and propelled forward by a tugboat. The tug orients the barges south, and then begins a

172
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:19,440
massive 15-day journey through 19 locks and 1,500 miles or 2,400 kilometers of river.

173
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,800
This transportation method is propped up by the fact that grain is not a very time-sensitive

174
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,400
product. In its dry form it's hardly perishable, and given the huge quantity shipped simultaneously,

175
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,000
few ever have a pressing need for it. Therefore, this exceptionally slow system of barge transport

176
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,520
works fine, and it's certainly the most competitive in terms of cost. Shipping a ton of

177
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,720
grain all the way from St. Louis to New Orleans typically costs less than $20 on a Mississippi

178
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,520
River barge—far less than by truck or rail. In fact, a major reason why America's Corn Belt is

179
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,640
such a competitive agricultural region is its access to this low-cost means of transportation

180
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,760
via the Mississippi River. Other growing areas of the world, confined to high-cost truck or

181
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,280
rail transport, just can't compete against America's industry. The destination for all

182
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,880
these barges is New Orleans. Its prominence as a city has always been and still is linked to its

183
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,160
position at the end of America's most important navigable river. There, the barge from La Crosse

184
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,200
arrives at Cargill's massive New Orleans facility, where the grain enters yet another elevator.

185
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,160
Aggregated with the annual output of countless other farms, the Corn is next loaded onto a large,

186
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,840
ocean-going bulk carrier ship. And then finally, the bulk carrier navigates through the final

187
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,360
twists and turns of the Mississippi River, enters the Gulf of Mexico,

188
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,920
and begins a weeks-long journey to wherever the corn market's demand dictates.

189
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,520
One reason I was excited to cover this topic is because I knew I could get all sorts of

190
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,560
spectacular footage of the cornfields of Iowa from our stock footage provider, Storyblocks.

191
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,640
Quite literally since the very first Wendover video, they've been the first place we go to

192
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:03,280
find footage, which is why I'm so excited that they're now sponsoring us. As you might know,

193
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,640
most stock footage providers are focused on corporate contracts with massive media

194
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,120
organizations, so when an individual creator comes along, they charge them hundreds of dollars

195
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,880
per clip. Storyblocks, however, is made from the ground up to be the provider for creators.

196
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,960
They offer an unlimited subscription so that you can download and use as much as you need

197
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,520
for an annual price lower than what other providers charge for a clip. Beyond an unlimited

198
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,480
subscription, Storyblocks also offers an entirely royalty-free library, meaning you can use anything

199
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,920
from the library for any commercial or personal use. The library is also demand-driven, making

200
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,240
it so that what's add-in, 4K video, or After Effects and Premiere Pro templates, is of the

201
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,360
most use to you, the creator. And Storyblocks offers more than just footage and templates—they

202
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,360
also provide music, images, sound effects, and more. If you're already a creator or want to

203
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,600
become one, I can tell you from my more than five years of experience as their customer that

204
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,240
Storyblocks is an absolutely critical resource to have. I don't think I know a single full-time

205
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,400
creator that doesn't have a subscription to them. So, click the button on screen or head to

206
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Storyblocks.com slash Wendover to sign up, and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
