560	7440	This is Bancroft. It's a small Iowa town composed of a grocery store, a bank, a liquor store,
7440	12000	hardware store, office supply store, flower shop, hair salon, medical clinic, bed and breakfast,
12000	16240	funeral home, trailer manufacturer, whiskey distillery, gym, baseball field, city pool,
16240	20000	nine-hole golf course, two gas stations, two restaurants, two feed suppliers, two car
20000	27840	dealerships, 346 homes, 699 people, and that's about it. Bancroft more or less nestles into a
27840	34720	single 1x1 mile square, and it's surrounded by eight other 1x1 mile squares—fields full of corn
34720	40560	and soybean. Six squares down, there's another town, Burt. Six to the west, it's Lone Rock,
40560	46320	then six more, and there's Fenton. This consistent human distribution is reflective of these towns'
46320	52160	common cause. They're farm towns. Their economy is the fuels that envelop them, it's the crops
52160	56880	they grow, and so their spacing is dictated by the amount of people that these fields that separate
56880	63280	them can reasonably provide for financially. 974 of these squares combined represent Coseth
63280	70400	County. Of those, a full 355 are dedicated to the cultivation of soybean, while even more,
70400	77840	475, are used to grow corn. Therefore, this county, as large as the country of Luxembourg,
77840	85440	uses some 85% of its area for the singular purpose of growing these two crops. The reason why is
85440	91600	because Coseth County and its neighbors are powerhouses in the world of agriculture—crucial
91600	96720	food production resources not only for Iowa, not only for the United States, not only even just
96720	103520	for North America, but for the entire world. For a farmer living and working, say, here,
103520	107840	a four-mile drive outside of Bancroft on an average-sized farm, the process of feeding the
107840	112560	globe, supporting the American economy, powering the local community, and providing for their own
112640	117280	families starts anew every spring, when they sit down at the kitchen table, flip to April
117280	122000	on their calendar, and decide exactly when and exactly what they're going to plant.
122720	131440	Now, of the 23,195,000 acres planted in Iowa in 2021, 23 million acres were filled with soybean
131440	137280	or corn. It's a safe bet, in other words, that, come April, this farmer will be planting one of
137280	143200	these two major cash crops. Deciding what to plant, however, is not simply an either-or
143200	147280	proposition. Considering that all this land has been planted with corn in years prior,
147280	151120	and that events in other corn-producing regions of the world has this farmer feeling bullish on its
151120	156480	immediate prospects, it's likely that they'll pass on soybean and go with corn. But that's only
156480	162720	the start—now, the farmer has hundreds of viable seed hybrids to choose from. Selective breeding
162720	167600	over millennia and genetic modification in recent decades, after all, are what transformed corn from
167600	173680	this to this—a crop packing enough energy to power combustion engines and America's meat industry
173680	179120	alike. There also would have allowed per-acre corn production to skyrocket over the past century,
179120	183120	as breeding for increased yield, disease resistance, and drought tolerance have
183120	188400	pushed bushel-per-acre yields to levels pre-war Americans could never have even imagined.
188880	194000	For this average Iowa farmer, on this average Iowa farm, though, it's not the path that matters,
194000	197600	but the future, and to ensure they're making the most of the growing season,
197600	204160	they need to nail their seed selection. 99% of corn grown in Iowa isn't the type you eat fresh
204160	208720	off the cob—it's field corn, or the type that goes on to make ethanol in other parts of Iowa,
208720	214800	or feed livestock in Wyoming, or sweeten drinks in Georgia. And still, the options are endless
214800	219920	when it comes to field corn seeds—some hold it better in dry years, others in wet years.
219920	224320	Some produce stronger stalks, others produce larger ears. Some fare better when planted in
224320	229280	untilled soils, others require only minimal fertilizer. Ultimately, though, informing
229280	236320	which seed a farmer chooses largely comes down to one all-important metric—average yield—the
236320	241120	number of bushels each acre can produce. So, to figure out what will make the farmer the most
241120	246480	bushels and therefore the most money, they start here, with the Iowa Crop Improvement Association's
246480	251760	Corn Performance Test. Now, considering Bancroft's less than 30 miles or 50 kilometers from the test
251760	256800	site in Corwith, that the towns sit in the same ICIA north district, and that they both occupy
256800	261840	the same soil region made up of loamy Wisconsin glacial till, it stands to reason that what works
261840	267440	in one spot will work in the other. Grabbing the farmer's eyes first, then, are likely these legacy
267440	273040	and DeKalb seeds, which in 2021, a record-setting year for statewide yields, performed well above
273040	278560	the state average of 205 bushels per acre. Yield is the most important metric, but it's
278560	283840	not the only factor influencing our farmer's choice—the corn's use, the seed's price,
283840	288800	the farmer's past experiences, and brand loyalty all inform that final decision.
289440	293760	Given that DeKalb's hybrid performs so well in an environment so similar to Bancroft's,
293760	298560	and given that Arndorferbro's seed, conveniently located right here in Bancroft, just so happens
298560	303840	to sell DeKalb seeds, all things being equal, it makes sense that this farmer bought the DeKalb
303840	310080	$52.99 RIB or something like it. Or perhaps not—perhaps the farmer considered the weather
310080	315680	outlook for the coming year, and went a different route. You see, while billions of dollars a year
315680	320400	are invested in the creation of these hybrid seeds, and in turn, billions a year are brought
320400	325200	in by the crops these seeds produce, critical junctures of the process revolve entirely around
325200	331600	the farmer's informed and well-tuned intuition. 2022, for example, is a La Niña year—a year
331600	335680	where the winter has been cold and damp, and a year where cold snaps, above-average moisture,
335680	340160	and extreme weather events are bound to continue through spring and summer. Perhaps then, our
340160	344480	farmer, considering the higher likelihood of above-average rainfall and potential flooding,
344480	349920	went with a hybrid seed better suited for damp conditions. Such weather not only informs what
350000	354880	is planted, but when it's planted, too. Using Iowa State Extension estimates,
354880	360080	and assuming our farmer is aiming for maximum yield on their land, seeds for 395 acres will
360080	366800	cost $49,000, while running planting machinery another $4,500. If the farmer plants too early
366800	374000	and loses the crop to a late frost, they're effectively out $55,000. Seed selected,
374000	378480	weather considered, and risk accounted for, sometime during the last week of April and the
378480	383360	1st of May, our farmer attaches their 16-row planter onto a tractor, sets the attachment's
383360	389040	row width and seed depths, fills the fertilizer hopper, and sets out onto the field. For a few
389040	394240	days, machinery that's valued in the mid-six figures will get its only use of the year.
394240	398240	In the coming weeks, as spring gives way to summer, the corn stalks will begin to bolt
398240	404160	skyward, and the work will continue. A poor planting strategy can ruin a farmer's season,
404160	409200	but that doesn't mean a perfect strategy will result in maximum yield either. Throughout the
409200	413200	growing season, from the end of spring to the beginning of fall, much can go wrong,
413200	419200	and much hangs on the farmer's ability to adapt. While no farmer, Iowan, or otherwise can control
419200	425120	the weather, generations of agricultural Americans have done their best to exert at least some agency
425120	430160	over the environment. In Iowa, the most obvious sign of this pursuit is the ever-present, but
430160	436720	easy-to-overlook drainage ditch. While humble in form, these cuts into the countryside are critical,
436720	443600	and our farmer just northwest of Bancroft knows it. Take Mud Creek, for example. For Bancroft
443600	449200	golfers on Hole 2, it's a likely landing spot for an errant drive. For travelers leaving Bancroft on
449200	456080	Highway 169, it offers a brief change of scenery. For our farmer, though, Mud Creek serves as
456160	460880	insurance. You see, while the western US cut ditches and built dams to grow crops in the
460880	466240	desert, Iowans cut ditches to grow crops in wetlands. In Iowa, it's not the lack of rain
466240	471520	that makes farming hard, but its abundance. For our farmer, Mud Creek is the lowest point on the
471520	476640	property, and while it may cut slightly into their acreage, the creek, along with the subterranean
476640	481920	tiles and pipes, drain excess rainfall from the field and insulate the property from crop-killing
481920	487600	stagnant water. Without proper drainage, in a worst-case scenario, sprouting seeds drown,
487600	492800	topsoil runs off, and mud keeps the farmer from even inspecting the damage. In the best-case
492800	497120	scenario, without drainage tiles running below their field, a farmer's yields will be hampered
497120	502480	when the first rainstorm washes away the crop's fertilizer, and along with it, the farmer's yield.
502480	506640	Beyond keeping excess water away from the growing crop, the farmer must also make sure that the
506640	511440	plant has easy access to needed nutrients to ensure quality yields. Beginning when planted
511440	514960	with a starter fertilizer, then reapplied throughout the summer depending on the seed
514960	520640	and soil conditions, a mix of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are applied to maximize the plant's
520640	526240	growth. In such ideal growing conditions, though, corn stalks aren't the only thing growing on the
526240	531280	farmer's field. Along with proactively applying nutrients as the crop matures, the farmer also
531280	537680	monitors the arrival and spread of weeds and pests. Neither fertilizers nor pesticides are cheap.
537680	543040	According to Iowa State's estimated costs, at a per-acre rate, nitrogen is more expensive than
543040	547680	the seeds it supports, while applying pesticides requires additional machine hours or employing
547680	552960	a pilot to spread the product from above. And yet, the farmer wouldn't dare cut corners at
552960	558400	this stage, as these products are some of modern science's most successful forays into standardizing,
558400	564160	overriding, and protecting against nature's inherent chaos. And so, our farmer further
564160	568960	extends themselves financially as the corn stalks extend themselves vertically.
568960	573440	With the summer behind it and fall weather setting in, it's finally time for our farm,
573440	579440	and all the farms of Iowa, to begin capitalizing on all their work. But exactly when this happens
579440	584880	is not down to the farmers, it's down to the weather. This massive industry collectively
584880	589600	waits in the wings for the world to deliver a long enough stretch of dry days to allow the harvest to
589600	595840	begin—and this doesn't always come easy. In 2018, for example, Cozuth County received more than
595840	599920	double its average precipitation at the start of fall, which made it difficult to get the crop to
599920	604640	its necessary level of dryness, and impossible to get large farm equipment into the fields without
604640	609520	getting stuck in the mud. This slowed down the harvest considerably, and the county saw its worst
609520	616160	corn yields since 2014. Even a day of weather months before can sway the success of the harvest.
616160	622880	In 2020, Iowa suffered an extremely severe August derecho storm. The high winds it brought damaged
622880	628800	the crop, pushing stalks of corn into a severe lean. This leaning crop condition, referred to
628800	634240	as lodged corn, makes it difficult for combine harvesters to capture and process all the plant,
634240	640240	leading to lower yields. Therefore, immediately after the storm, local and regional agriculture
640240	644720	organizations started publishing information on how to adapt standard operating procedures
644720	649760	to this widespread damage. Many farmers took their advice to buy a special attachment for
649760	654880	their combine heads, which helps prop up lodged corn. Iowa State's Integrated Crop Management
654880	658960	Program also recommended harvesting from the direction to which the crop is leaning, lowering
658960	663760	the combine head more than typical, and operating at a lower speed. They even added a suggestion
663760	670080	that farmers call a dedicated 24-7 stress hotline if needed—acknowledging the degree of mental and
670080	675840	emotional impact a less-than-stellar harvest can have on farmers. Given the tiny margins in the
675840	679840	farming industry, the difference between an upright and leaning crop can mean the difference
679840	685600	between a profitable and unprofitable year given its impact on yields. But regardless of field
685600	691200	conditions, the combine harvester's job is the same—it's to take in the crop and process it
691200	697920	down into the grain by itself. Now, the combine harvester is an incredibly influential piece of
697920	703920	machinery—it is single-handedly responsible for much of the progress made in food supply and cost
703920	709760	over the past century. What was once an exceedingly manual process, involving a huge swath of laborers
709760	715600	picking and processing the crop primarily by hand, now occurs in a matter of seconds with a single
715600	720720	human operator. The combine's head orients to a certain height above the ground using a sensor,
720720	725520	and the entire machine auto-steers using another sensor that follows the line of corn.
725520	730000	Meanwhile, the snouts feed the crop to a pair of downward-spinning rotors that pull the plant
730000	735040	through a narrow gap with the ears of corn, given their wider shape, get caught and pulled inward
735040	740160	by gathering chains. Then, the ears are pulled in further by augers to the feedhouse, and fed
740160	744480	through a cylinder that throws the plants back into a series of mechanical processes that separate
744480	749280	the grain from the chuff, the unusable part, and by the end a series of augers and paddles pull
749280	754640	the corn kernels themselves up into the combine's tanks. As the combine harvests, a tractor with a
754640	759120	grain cart pulls alongside it, and the combine lets out its arm and delivers grain into the cart.
759760	763600	Once full, the tractor drives away, while the combine continues harvesting,
763600	768400	and heads to a waiting semi-truck pulling a far larger grain trailer, in which it deposits its
768400	773280	load. The process repeats itself until the trailer is full, at which point the semi drives a couple
773280	779600	miles into Bancroft. Now, a common landmark across nearly all of Iowa's small farming towns
779600	785040	is each community's grain elevator. These are absolutely critical pieces of infrastructure
785040	790720	for the region's economy. Bancroft's, indicative, is operated by the Regional Farmers Co-op,
790720	796320	State Line Cooperative. Upon arrival, a probe is placed into the grain trailer to take a sample
796320	802080	of the corn. That sample is inspected and tested for its moisture content—it has to be below 15%
802080	806400	to ensure mold won't grow during storage, which is especially important since it'll be mixed in with
806400	811520	other farmers' crop. Simultaneously, the truck is weighed to determine how much corn is being
811520	816240	delivered. Then, it pulls forward and a door beneath the trailer opens to pour the grain
816240	821440	through a grate below. Finally, a bucket belt carries the grain to the very top of the elevator,
821440	827360	where it gets deposited into the storage bin. Now the farmers have two primary choices for what
827360	831600	happens next. They could sell their crop immediately to the co-op, in which case they
831600	836960	get paid based on corn's current market rate. However, during the harvest season, market rates
836960	841520	for the crop often dip as it gets flooded with supply, especially recently given a widespread
841520	848000	shortage of grain storage capacity. Therefore, if farmers can store the corn, they often do.
848000	852400	Bancroft's grain elevator charges five cents per month per bushel for the first three months,
852400	857600	then four cents per bushel per month after that, but this cost is typically well worth it.
857600	862720	During 2021's harvest season, for example, market prices were about $5.5 per bushel,
862720	870080	but by spring 2022, they were up to $7.5. The grain market is a global one, and so ebbs and
870080	874720	flows in supply and demand around the world influence how many trucks roll through Bancroft's
874720	879680	streets to pick up a load from their grain elevator on a given day. Once that day does come,
879680	883920	though, if it's not going to a nearby processing facility to be turned into livestock feed or
883920	888080	ethanol, chances are good that a truck in Bancroft is starting a trip three hours east
888080	892480	to La Crosse, Wisconsin. There, it unloads at a small grain elevator on the banks of the
892480	897120	Mississippi River run by Cargill, one of the largest companies in the world which,
897120	902560	among other food-related functions, holds about 25% of the US's grain export market.
903120	907600	Once enough product is aggregated, it's loaded into a series of barges which are then lashed
907600	913040	together and propelled forward by a tugboat. The tug orients the barges south, and then begins a
913040	919440	massive 15-day journey through 19 locks and 1,500 miles or 2,400 kilometers of river.
920000	924800	This transportation method is propped up by the fact that grain is not a very time-sensitive
924800	930400	product. In its dry form it's hardly perishable, and given the huge quantity shipped simultaneously,
930400	936000	few ever have a pressing need for it. Therefore, this exceptionally slow system of barge transport
936000	941520	works fine, and it's certainly the most competitive in terms of cost. Shipping a ton of
941520	946720	grain all the way from St. Louis to New Orleans typically costs less than $20 on a Mississippi
946720	953520	River barge—far less than by truck or rail. In fact, a major reason why America's Corn Belt is
953520	958640	such a competitive agricultural region is its access to this low-cost means of transportation
958640	963760	via the Mississippi River. Other growing areas of the world, confined to high-cost truck or
963760	969280	rail transport, just can't compete against America's industry. The destination for all
969280	974880	these barges is New Orleans. Its prominence as a city has always been and still is linked to its
974880	980160	position at the end of America's most important navigable river. There, the barge from La Crosse
980160	985200	arrives at Cargill's massive New Orleans facility, where the grain enters yet another elevator.
985200	990160	Aggregated with the annual output of countless other farms, the Corn is next loaded onto a large,
990160	995840	ocean-going bulk carrier ship. And then finally, the bulk carrier navigates through the final
995840	999360	twists and turns of the Mississippi River, enters the Gulf of Mexico,
999360	1003920	and begins a weeks-long journey to wherever the corn market's demand dictates.
1005360	1009520	One reason I was excited to cover this topic is because I knew I could get all sorts of
1009520	1014560	spectacular footage of the cornfields of Iowa from our stock footage provider, Storyblocks.
1014560	1018640	Quite literally since the very first Wendover video, they've been the first place we go to
1018640	1023280	find footage, which is why I'm so excited that they're now sponsoring us. As you might know,
1023280	1026640	most stock footage providers are focused on corporate contracts with massive media
1026640	1031120	organizations, so when an individual creator comes along, they charge them hundreds of dollars
1031120	1036880	per clip. Storyblocks, however, is made from the ground up to be the provider for creators.
1036880	1040960	They offer an unlimited subscription so that you can download and use as much as you need
1040960	1045520	for an annual price lower than what other providers charge for a clip. Beyond an unlimited
1045520	1050480	subscription, Storyblocks also offers an entirely royalty-free library, meaning you can use anything
1050480	1055920	from the library for any commercial or personal use. The library is also demand-driven, making
1055920	1060240	it so that what's add-in, 4K video, or After Effects and Premiere Pro templates, is of the
1060240	1065360	most use to you, the creator. And Storyblocks offers more than just footage and templates—they
1065360	1069360	also provide music, images, sound effects, and more. If you're already a creator or want to
1069360	1073600	become one, I can tell you from my more than five years of experience as their customer that
1073600	1078240	Storyblocks is an absolutely critical resource to have. I don't think I know a single full-time
1078240	1082400	creator that doesn't have a subscription to them. So, click the button on screen or head to
