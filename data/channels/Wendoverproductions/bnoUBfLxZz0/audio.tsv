9380	11360	Modern medicine requires blood.
11360	15700	It is a crucial element to the successful treatment of countless conditions.
15700	20120	Blood transfusions are by far the most common procedure performed in most hospitals.
20120	24560	In fact, they are so routine that even ambulance EMTs are now performing them in the field
24560	26160	for traumatic injuries.
26160	30620	The only problem is that, at least right now, the blood we use for human transfusions
30620	33120	has to come from humans.
33120	37920	Synthetic blood substitutes are under development but for now, real, donated human blood is
37920	39360	all we can use.
39360	41380	This blood, though, has a shelf life.
41380	45060	Red blood cells, the most commonly transfused blood product, have a government mandated
45060	49680	shelf life of 42 days in the US, 35 days in Europe, and similar numbers in the rest of
49680	50680	the world.
50680	54200	There's even some research suggesting that red blood cells deteriorate in quality after
54200	58840	as little as 21 days so there's a big focus on getting them from donor to recipient as
58840	60540	quickly as possible.
60540	64900	Even 21 days probably seems like plenty of time but huge quantities of blood are taken
64900	69640	from huge numbers of individuals and there are plenty of steps in between donation and
69640	70640	transfusion.
70640	74960	In developed countries like the UK, this supply chain works quite similarly to any other.
74960	79640	The NHS Blood and Transplant Division manages the process for England and Wales.
79640	83640	About 90% of their blood comes from donations given in their mobile blood banks that visit
83640	87060	schools, community centers, sports clubs, and other locations.
87060	91480	Donors are first screened verbally and through a hemoglobin test then a single unit of blood,
91480	93680	470 milliliters, is taken.
93680	98480	After a day of collection, product is taken back to the nearest of 13 processing centers.
98480	102160	Over the following days, the blood is placed on a centrifuge where it separates into red
102160	103880	blood cells and plasma.
103880	107600	There are then additional tests to determine blood type and to assure it's safe to transfuse
107600	110640	and then is packaged up and sent to hospitals via truck.
110640	115120	As a whole, NHS Blood and Transplant aims to have between 40,000 and 50,000 units of
115120	119080	blood in their system at any given time to deal with surges in demand.
119080	122400	While red blood cells will last for about a month, platelets and some other blood products
122400	126200	will last for less than a week so this whole process has to be sped up.
126200	130520	Of course, there are other products that require fast transportation like fresh fish and flowers
130520	134600	but the difference between these two is that if fish and flowers run out, people complain.
134600	137200	If blood products run out, people die.
137560	140800	Stockout just is not possible in the blood supply chain which means countries have to
140800	144920	have enough blood in their system to deal with surges in demand associated with situations
144920	148420	like natural disasters and other mass casualty events.
148420	151940	Because of this, there is always a decent amount of waste.
151940	155780	Blood will quite often expire before it's used but that's just a luxury rich countries
155780	157760	like the UK have.
157760	161260	Collecting and certifying blood isn't cheap but still, they're able to spend their way
161260	165680	into creating enough blood products so that there are almost never stockouts.
165680	168960	Less developed countries, though, don't have that luxury.
168960	174120	Like the UK, the sub-Saharan African country of Rwanda operates a system of universal healthcare
174120	178540	but, like the population, the government is not rich so it can't afford for much waste
178540	180640	in its blood distribution system.
180640	184700	The average resident of the UK makes about $40,000 US dollars per year.
184700	190520	The average resident of Rwanda, on the other hand, makes just $720.
190520	195560	Despite being a country of $12 million, Rwanda's economy is about the same size as the small
195560	197280	British city of Plymouth.
197280	200400	There's an anomaly in the country's indicators, though.
200400	205640	It sits as the 17th poorest country in sub-Saharan Africa, well in the bottom half, although,
205640	209400	in terms of life expectancy, it's tied for fourth best.
209400	214120	Rwanda has been identified as having one of the best healthcare systems in Africa.
214120	219400	In fact, its 67-year life expectancy is higher than that of some far richer African countries
219400	221460	like Namibia and South Africa.
221460	225620	The reason behind this no doubt has a lot to do with the fact that Rwanda, uncharacteristically
225620	229660	for a poor African country, has a universal healthcare system where everyone has access
229660	234660	to hospitals at an affordable or no cost but, in addition, some have attributed Rwanda's
234660	237860	healthcare success to its willingness to embrace innovation.
237860	241780	One of the most visible of these innovations has to do with how the country's hospitals
241780	242780	get their blood.
242780	246700	They've outsourced much of the country's blood delivery to a company called Zipline
246700	251080	and Zipline delivers blood to hospitals across Rwanda by drone.
251080	255240	This is one of the world's first commercial applications of drone delivery.
255240	259320	While companies like Google and Amazon are testing drone delivery in developed countries,
259320	264400	Rwanda, a developing country, already has a full-scale, nearly country-wide drone delivery
264400	267280	system in service right now.
267280	268920	How it works is this.
268920	272720	The drones currently service 21 hospitals in the western half of the country.
272720	276880	The closest is just 2.5 miles or 4 kilometers from Zipline's facility in Muhanga with
276880	280320	the furthest being about 50 miles or 80 kilometers away.
280560	284480	Many of these hospitals can place an order with Zipline pretty much in any way they can—email,
284480	287680	text, phone, whatsapp, anything.
287680	291200	Within this building, the individual sitting on the left takes orders, passes information
291200	294940	onto the next person in the process, and stays in contact with the hospital throughout the
294940	297820	process to let them know when their delivery will arrive.
297820	301440	The individual on the right is then in charge of packaging up the delivery.
301440	305200	Zipline's blood products are delivered to them by road from the Rwandan health system
305200	307040	so they have a supply on hand.
307040	309720	The product is packaged into one of these boxes.
309720	314320	The whole process is designed to be as simple as possible so these boxes are single use.
314320	318360	They're assembled on-site from cardboard, bubble wrap, and tape with a parachute being
318360	319680	made from paper.
319680	324000	That way, nobody has to drive out to hospitals to pick parachutes and boxes up.
324000	327760	From there, the boxes pass through the window and a bell is rung to let the next person
327760	329340	know the delivery is ready.
329340	333300	The delivery is brought over to a ready drone, an app is used to scan QR codes to verify
333300	337500	the delivery and drone, then the delivery is placed in the body of the drone.
337500	340260	The drone is then picked up and brought over to the catapult.
340260	344120	Meanwhile, another operator comes over and fixes the wings on the drone while another
344120	345780	places the battery pack in.
345780	349900	The drone is now almost ready for flight but first the operators perform a visual inspection
349900	354340	for damage and use an app to check to be sure that all moving components are working.
354340	357620	During this whole process, someone else is sitting in what's known as the crow's
357620	360060	nest performing another crucial step.
360060	362940	This individual is essentially air traffic control for Zipline.
362940	366380	They're in charge of the drones while they're flying so the first step is to coordinate
366380	369980	with Rwandan air traffic control to make sure they have clearance to fly.
369980	372200	Now, Rwandan airspace is not busy.
372200	376140	In fact, Zipline has about as many daily flights as Kigali Airport, the main airport in the
376140	380380	country, so it's rare not to gain clearance immediately but still, this individual calls
380380	382100	into Kigali to be sure.
382100	385620	From there, they give clearance to the catapult operator to launch and the catapult operator
385620	388580	makes sure nobody is standing in front of the launch site.
388580	392180	There are quite often children on the other side of the fence watching the goings on.
392180	396220	From there, they press the green button, an electric motor spins, pulls the catapult,
396220	399620	and the drone reaches takeoff speed in a fraction of a second.
399620	402540	Once in flight, the drone follows a pre-set flight path.
402540	407900	Now, the drone is autonomous—it flies itself—but it has no decision-making authority.
407900	411760	It flies high enough where it doesn't require any obstacle avoidance ability and, if it
411760	415080	needs to hold for a minute to wait for air traffic to clear, it's told by the controller
415080	417220	to enter a pre-set holding pattern.
417220	420200	There are few weather conditions that these drones can't fly through.
420200	424260	They can handle severe wind, rain, and lightning, but if they can't make it to their destination,
424300	427740	they can also use one of these pre-set holding patterns to turn around.
427740	431540	While the drones have improved greatly since a few years ago, a critical fault does happen
431540	433780	every few hundred or so flights.
433780	437720	In this case, the drone has a built-in parachute that it triggers itself to safely fall back
437720	438900	to the ground.
438900	442380	Crucially, no one has ever been injured by a zipline drone.
442380	446500	If for any reason a drone needs to stop flying immediately, such as if zipline were to receive
446500	450380	an order by air traffic control to immediately get out of certain airspace, the controller
450380	453880	back at base could also manually trigger the parachute to deploy.
454500	457540	From there, operators would go out and recover the drones by road.
457540	461800	The drones fly at 60 miles or 100 kilometers per hour so they reach the nearest hospitals
461800	466200	in mere minutes while the furthest hospitals, about 50 miles or 80 kilometers away, require
466200	468840	about a 50 minute flight to reach.
468840	472560	As a drone reaches its delivery point, the individual in charge of communication will
472560	474340	text the hospital to let them know.
474340	477840	The drone will approach the delivery point, circle around to lose altitude, then fly a
477840	483160	few hundred feet over a predetermined landing spot, open his belly doors, and drop the package.
483160	487500	The parachute will slow its fall but impact is also softened by the bubble wrap inside.
487500	491600	From there, the blood product has arrived and hospital staff just walk outside to collect
491600	492600	it.
492600	496440	For the nearest sites, these blood deliveries arrive in about 15 minutes ready to be transfused
496440	498700	into patients critically in need.
498700	500600	But the process isn't over yet.
500600	504620	The drone gains altitude, flies back towards the zipline site, then circles again to lose
504620	505620	altitude.
505620	508760	Now, you'll notice these drones have no wheels.
508760	511200	That would add unnecessary weight and complexity.
511240	514880	Once they've reached a precise altitude, the drone will come in against the wind, about
514880	518500	15 feet or 5 meters above the ground, then bam.
518500	520840	As quickly as the drone launched, it's landed.
520840	525280	A tiny hook on the back of the drone catches a wire mid-air then the drone swings to a
525280	526280	stop.
526280	529640	The level of precision needed to make this landing process work is remarkable and is
529640	532600	a testament to how far drone technology has come.
532600	536320	The operators take the wings and batteries off, put the drone back on its stand, and
536320	539040	it's ready to go again just like that.
539080	544460	Now, Rwanda is not a large country physically—it's far smaller than the UK—so you might wonder
544460	548440	why they can't just rely on blood delivery by road like the UK.
548440	551720	For one, Rwanda's road infrastructure is lacking.
551720	555660	While the major roads are paved and in good quality, the majority of the country's roads
555660	556680	are dirt.
556680	560840	When it's dry these roads work alright, but Rwanda sees two significant rainy seasons
560840	565800	from February to June and September to December when there are heavy rains almost every day.
565800	570440	With this, these dirt roads can become impassable for days due to floods and mud.
570440	573900	One solution could be to stock rural hospitals with plenty of blood products to last through
573900	577760	periods when trucks can't get to them, but that would lead to heavy wastage and safe
577760	579600	processed blood isn't cheap.
579600	583580	It would also prevent the usage of platelets and plasma which only have shelf lives of
583580	584880	under a week.
584880	588840	Therefore, the drones make it so that, no matter the conditions, any hospital in the
588840	591960	network can receive red blood products in under an hour.
591960	596040	While most deliveries just serve to restock these sites, about a third are for emergency
596040	599920	situations where a hospital is out of stock of a particular blood product that a patient
599920	600920	needs.
600920	605040	Now, the potential applications of this type of technology stretch far beyond its current
605040	606040	application.
606040	610280	While the drones currently deliver just blood, Zipline is testing delivery of about 500 other
610280	614800	medical products including bandages, medicines, almost anything a hospital could need so that
614800	618320	if a hospital is missing something, they can get it in at most an hour.
618320	621800	They're also preparing to put a drone base online in the eastern half of the country
621800	624160	to have nearly nationwide coverage.
624160	628040	One potential application of having two bases within range of each other is that if one
628040	631760	base runs out of a product that is needed on its side of the country, a drone can be
631760	636460	loaded from the other base, fly over, land, have its battery replaced, and launched again
636460	638640	to fly to its final delivery point.
638640	643040	Rwanda is quite a well-suited test case for this drone technology since it is fairly small
643040	647140	and densely populated but this feasibility of transferring drones between bases could
647140	650760	also help create a network structure that works for less dense countries.
650760	654860	The Ghanaian parliament recently approved an agreement with Zipline to expand into their
654860	655860	country.
655860	659980	Ghana is rather tall and narrow with density, as a rule, more or less decreasing as one
659980	660980	goes north.
660980	664540	While the exact service areas and details have yet to be announced, what could work
664540	668560	on a conceptual level would be to have a number of bases within range of each other.
668560	672740	The rarest, most expensive, or lowest demand products such as platelets and plasma could
672740	677080	be stored at the southernmost base and, if needed, could be sent north to the less busy
677080	681360	bases serving less dense and less busy areas by a drone stopping at each base and having
681360	682800	their batteries swapped.
682800	687340	Lastly, one other potential application for these drones is for disaster relief.
687340	690800	The bare basics needed to start operations can be packed into a single shipping container
690800	692880	and assembled in just a few days.
692880	697200	The system is designed for places like Rwanda where road infrastructure is lacking and after
697200	701300	major natural disasters, road infrastructure often is lacking.
701300	705420	It could be quite impactful to be able to deploy a relatively low-cost, high-frequency
705420	709080	delivery system over a disaster area using drones like these.
709080	712900	While the Zipline system is not currently set up for fast deployment in disaster relief
712900	716360	situations, the company has considered working on this for the future so they could set up
716360	719900	a base, plan flight paths, and begin operations quickly.
719900	723620	So far, Zipline's drones have, in their initial deployment in Rwanda, served their
723620	728460	mission effectively of reliably linking rural hospitals to modern medical product.
728460	732160	Having proved themselves with this first deployment, the company is now entering a phase of rather
732160	736160	fast expansion both in the scope of their service in Rwanda and the number of countries
736160	737460	served overall.
737460	742100	Of course, the drone solution is just a bandage on a wider problem of poor transportation
742100	746460	infrastructure in Rwanda and other developing countries but, at least in the long period
746460	751020	of time a developing country waits to be developed, drone technology might be an effective solution
751020	754620	for improving medical logistics fast.
754620	758620	There are loads of interesting physics that go into how drones like those flying in Rwanda
758620	759620	work.
759620	762920	For example, with a quadcopter, there's a theoretical limit to how large a battery
762920	767000	a drone can have since eventually, the extra power needed to carry the extra weight of
767000	770360	the battery is greater than the extra power the extra battery provides.
770360	774120	Brilliant's classical mechanics course teaches you how to calculate what the maximum theoretical
774120	778720	flying time, using this principle, would be for a DJI Mavic Pro—of course in addition
778720	781040	to plenty of other useful physics concepts.
781040	785180	Like all Brilliant's courses, this one teaches you the small, intuitive concepts behind the
785180	790000	big subjects and then links them all together so that you can truly understand what you're
790000	792700	learning—you don't just memorize procedures and facts.
