3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,360
Modern medicine requires blood.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,700
It is a crucial element to the successful treatment of countless conditions.

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,120
Blood transfusions are by far the most common procedure performed in most hospitals.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,560
In fact, they are so routine that even ambulance EMTs are now performing them in the field

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,160
for traumatic injuries.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,620
The only problem is that, at least right now, the blood we use for human transfusions

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,120
has to come from humans.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,920
Synthetic blood substitutes are under development but for now, real, donated human blood is

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,360
all we can use.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,380
This blood, though, has a shelf life.

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,060
Red blood cells, the most commonly transfused blood product, have a government mandated

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,680
shelf life of 42 days in the US, 35 days in Europe, and similar numbers in the rest of

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,680
the world.

16
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,200
There's even some research suggesting that red blood cells deteriorate in quality after

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,840
as little as 21 days so there's a big focus on getting them from donor to recipient as

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,540
quickly as possible.

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,900
Even 21 days probably seems like plenty of time but huge quantities of blood are taken

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:09,640
from huge numbers of individuals and there are plenty of steps in between donation and

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,640
transfusion.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,960
In developed countries like the UK, this supply chain works quite similarly to any other.

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,640
The NHS Blood and Transplant Division manages the process for England and Wales.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,640
About 90% of their blood comes from donations given in their mobile blood banks that visit

25
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,060
schools, community centers, sports clubs, and other locations.

26
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,480
Donors are first screened verbally and through a hemoglobin test then a single unit of blood,

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,680
470 milliliters, is taken.

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,480
After a day of collection, product is taken back to the nearest of 13 processing centers.

29
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,160
Over the following days, the blood is placed on a centrifuge where it separates into red

30
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,880
blood cells and plasma.

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,600
There are then additional tests to determine blood type and to assure it's safe to transfuse

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,640
and then is packaged up and sent to hospitals via truck.

33
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,120
As a whole, NHS Blood and Transplant aims to have between 40,000 and 50,000 units of

34
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,080
blood in their system at any given time to deal with surges in demand.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,400
While red blood cells will last for about a month, platelets and some other blood products

36
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,200
will last for less than a week so this whole process has to be sped up.

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,520
Of course, there are other products that require fast transportation like fresh fish and flowers

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,600
but the difference between these two is that if fish and flowers run out, people complain.

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,200
If blood products run out, people die.

40
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Stockout just is not possible in the blood supply chain which means countries have to

41
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,920
have enough blood in their system to deal with surges in demand associated with situations

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,420
like natural disasters and other mass casualty events.

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,940
Because of this, there is always a decent amount of waste.

44
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,780
Blood will quite often expire before it's used but that's just a luxury rich countries

45
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,760
like the UK have.

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,260
Collecting and certifying blood isn't cheap but still, they're able to spend their way

47
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,680
into creating enough blood products so that there are almost never stockouts.

48
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Less developed countries, though, don't have that luxury.

49
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,120
Like the UK, the sub-Saharan African country of Rwanda operates a system of universal healthcare

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,540
but, like the population, the government is not rich so it can't afford for much waste

51
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,640
in its blood distribution system.

52
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,700
The average resident of the UK makes about $40,000 US dollars per year.

53
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,520
The average resident of Rwanda, on the other hand, makes just $720.

54
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,560
Despite being a country of $12 million, Rwanda's economy is about the same size as the small

55
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,280
British city of Plymouth.

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,400
There's an anomaly in the country's indicators, though.

57
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,640
It sits as the 17th poorest country in sub-Saharan Africa, well in the bottom half, although,

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,400
in terms of life expectancy, it's tied for fourth best.

59
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Rwanda has been identified as having one of the best healthcare systems in Africa.

60
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,400
In fact, its 67-year life expectancy is higher than that of some far richer African countries

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,460
like Namibia and South Africa.

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,620
The reason behind this no doubt has a lot to do with the fact that Rwanda, uncharacteristically

63
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,660
for a poor African country, has a universal healthcare system where everyone has access

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,660
to hospitals at an affordable or no cost but, in addition, some have attributed Rwanda's

65
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,860
healthcare success to its willingness to embrace innovation.

66
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,780
One of the most visible of these innovations has to do with how the country's hospitals

67
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,780
get their blood.

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,700
They've outsourced much of the country's blood delivery to a company called Zipline

69
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,080
and Zipline delivers blood to hospitals across Rwanda by drone.

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,240
This is one of the world's first commercial applications of drone delivery.

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,320
While companies like Google and Amazon are testing drone delivery in developed countries,

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:24,400
Rwanda, a developing country, already has a full-scale, nearly country-wide drone delivery

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
system in service right now.

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,920
How it works is this.

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,720
The drones currently service 21 hospitals in the western half of the country.

76
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,880
The closest is just 2.5 miles or 4 kilometers from Zipline's facility in Muhanga with

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,320
the furthest being about 50 miles or 80 kilometers away.

78
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Many of these hospitals can place an order with Zipline pretty much in any way they canâ€”email,

79
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,680
text, phone, whatsapp, anything.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,200
Within this building, the individual sitting on the left takes orders, passes information

81
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,940
onto the next person in the process, and stays in contact with the hospital throughout the

82
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,820
process to let them know when their delivery will arrive.

83
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,440
The individual on the right is then in charge of packaging up the delivery.

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,200
Zipline's blood products are delivered to them by road from the Rwandan health system

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,040
so they have a supply on hand.

86
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,720
The product is packaged into one of these boxes.

87
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,320
The whole process is designed to be as simple as possible so these boxes are single use.

88
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,360
They're assembled on-site from cardboard, bubble wrap, and tape with a parachute being

89
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,680
made from paper.

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
That way, nobody has to drive out to hospitals to pick parachutes and boxes up.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,760
From there, the boxes pass through the window and a bell is rung to let the next person

92
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,340
know the delivery is ready.

93
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,300
The delivery is brought over to a ready drone, an app is used to scan QR codes to verify

94
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,500
the delivery and drone, then the delivery is placed in the body of the drone.

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,260
The drone is then picked up and brought over to the catapult.

96
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,120
Meanwhile, another operator comes over and fixes the wings on the drone while another

97
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,780
places the battery pack in.

98
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,900
The drone is now almost ready for flight but first the operators perform a visual inspection

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,340
for damage and use an app to check to be sure that all moving components are working.

100
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,620
During this whole process, someone else is sitting in what's known as the crow's

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,060
nest performing another crucial step.

102
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,940
This individual is essentially air traffic control for Zipline.

103
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:06,380
They're in charge of the drones while they're flying so the first step is to coordinate

104
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,980
with Rwandan air traffic control to make sure they have clearance to fly.

105
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,200
Now, Rwandan airspace is not busy.

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,140
In fact, Zipline has about as many daily flights as Kigali Airport, the main airport in the

107
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,380
country, so it's rare not to gain clearance immediately but still, this individual calls

108
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,100
into Kigali to be sure.

109
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,620
From there, they give clearance to the catapult operator to launch and the catapult operator

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,580
makes sure nobody is standing in front of the launch site.

111
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,180
There are quite often children on the other side of the fence watching the goings on.

112
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,220
From there, they press the green button, an electric motor spins, pulls the catapult,

113
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,620
and the drone reaches takeoff speed in a fraction of a second.

114
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,540
Once in flight, the drone follows a pre-set flight path.

115
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,900
Now, the drone is autonomousâ€”it flies itselfâ€”but it has no decision-making authority.

116
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,760
It flies high enough where it doesn't require any obstacle avoidance ability and, if it

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,080
needs to hold for a minute to wait for air traffic to clear, it's told by the controller

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,220
to enter a pre-set holding pattern.

119
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,200
There are few weather conditions that these drones can't fly through.

120
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,260
They can handle severe wind, rain, and lightning, but if they can't make it to their destination,

121
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,740
they can also use one of these pre-set holding patterns to turn around.

122
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,540
While the drones have improved greatly since a few years ago, a critical fault does happen

123
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,780
every few hundred or so flights.

124
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,720
In this case, the drone has a built-in parachute that it triggers itself to safely fall back

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,900
to the ground.

126
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,380
Crucially, no one has ever been injured by a zipline drone.

127
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,500
If for any reason a drone needs to stop flying immediately, such as if zipline were to receive

128
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,380
an order by air traffic control to immediately get out of certain airspace, the controller

129
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,880
back at base could also manually trigger the parachute to deploy.

130
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,540
From there, operators would go out and recover the drones by road.

131
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,800
The drones fly at 60 miles or 100 kilometers per hour so they reach the nearest hospitals

132
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,200
in mere minutes while the furthest hospitals, about 50 miles or 80 kilometers away, require

133
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,840
about a 50 minute flight to reach.

134
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,560
As a drone reaches its delivery point, the individual in charge of communication will

135
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,340
text the hospital to let them know.

136
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,840
The drone will approach the delivery point, circle around to lose altitude, then fly a

137
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,160
few hundred feet over a predetermined landing spot, open his belly doors, and drop the package.

138
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,500
The parachute will slow its fall but impact is also softened by the bubble wrap inside.

139
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,600
From there, the blood product has arrived and hospital staff just walk outside to collect

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
it.

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,440
For the nearest sites, these blood deliveries arrive in about 15 minutes ready to be transfused

142
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,700
into patients critically in need.

143
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,600
But the process isn't over yet.

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,620
The drone gains altitude, flies back towards the zipline site, then circles again to lose

145
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
altitude.

146
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,760
Now, you'll notice these drones have no wheels.

147
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,200
That would add unnecessary weight and complexity.

148
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,880
Once they've reached a precise altitude, the drone will come in against the wind, about

149
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,500
15 feet or 5 meters above the ground, then bam.

150
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,840
As quickly as the drone launched, it's landed.

151
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,280
A tiny hook on the back of the drone catches a wire mid-air then the drone swings to a

152
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
stop.

153
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,640
The level of precision needed to make this landing process work is remarkable and is

154
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,600
a testament to how far drone technology has come.

155
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,320
The operators take the wings and batteries off, put the drone back on its stand, and

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
it's ready to go again just like that.

157
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,460
Now, Rwanda is not a large country physicallyâ€”it's far smaller than the UKâ€”so you might wonder

158
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,440
why they can't just rely on blood delivery by road like the UK.

159
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,720
For one, Rwanda's road infrastructure is lacking.

160
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,660
While the major roads are paved and in good quality, the majority of the country's roads

161
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,680
are dirt.

162
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,840
When it's dry these roads work alright, but Rwanda sees two significant rainy seasons

163
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,800
from February to June and September to December when there are heavy rains almost every day.

164
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,440
With this, these dirt roads can become impassable for days due to floods and mud.

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,900
One solution could be to stock rural hospitals with plenty of blood products to last through

166
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,760
periods when trucks can't get to them, but that would lead to heavy wastage and safe

167
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,600
processed blood isn't cheap.

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,580
It would also prevent the usage of platelets and plasma which only have shelf lives of

169
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,880
under a week.

170
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,840
Therefore, the drones make it so that, no matter the conditions, any hospital in the

171
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,960
network can receive red blood products in under an hour.

172
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,040
While most deliveries just serve to restock these sites, about a third are for emergency

173
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,920
situations where a hospital is out of stock of a particular blood product that a patient

174
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
needs.

175
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,040
Now, the potential applications of this type of technology stretch far beyond its current

176
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
application.

177
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,280
While the drones currently deliver just blood, Zipline is testing delivery of about 500 other

178
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,800
medical products including bandages, medicines, almost anything a hospital could need so that

179
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,320
if a hospital is missing something, they can get it in at most an hour.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,800
They're also preparing to put a drone base online in the eastern half of the country

181
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,160
to have nearly nationwide coverage.

182
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,040
One potential application of having two bases within range of each other is that if one

183
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,760
base runs out of a product that is needed on its side of the country, a drone can be

184
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,460
loaded from the other base, fly over, land, have its battery replaced, and launched again

185
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,640
to fly to its final delivery point.

186
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,040
Rwanda is quite a well-suited test case for this drone technology since it is fairly small

187
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,140
and densely populated but this feasibility of transferring drones between bases could

188
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,760
also help create a network structure that works for less dense countries.

189
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,860
The Ghanaian parliament recently approved an agreement with Zipline to expand into their

190
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,860
country.

191
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,980
Ghana is rather tall and narrow with density, as a rule, more or less decreasing as one

192
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
goes north.

193
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,540
While the exact service areas and details have yet to be announced, what could work

194
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,560
on a conceptual level would be to have a number of bases within range of each other.

195
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,740
The rarest, most expensive, or lowest demand products such as platelets and plasma could

196
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,080
be stored at the southernmost base and, if needed, could be sent north to the less busy

197
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,360
bases serving less dense and less busy areas by a drone stopping at each base and having

198
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
their batteries swapped.

199
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,340
Lastly, one other potential application for these drones is for disaster relief.

200
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,800
The bare basics needed to start operations can be packed into a single shipping container

201
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
and assembled in just a few days.

202
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,200
The system is designed for places like Rwanda where road infrastructure is lacking and after

203
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,300
major natural disasters, road infrastructure often is lacking.

204
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,420
It could be quite impactful to be able to deploy a relatively low-cost, high-frequency

205
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,080
delivery system over a disaster area using drones like these.

206
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,900
While the Zipline system is not currently set up for fast deployment in disaster relief

207
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,360
situations, the company has considered working on this for the future so they could set up

208
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,900
a base, plan flight paths, and begin operations quickly.

209
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,620
So far, Zipline's drones have, in their initial deployment in Rwanda, served their

210
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,460
mission effectively of reliably linking rural hospitals to modern medical product.

211
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:12,160
Having proved themselves with this first deployment, the company is now entering a phase of rather

212
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,160
fast expansion both in the scope of their service in Rwanda and the number of countries

213
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,460
served overall.

214
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,100
Of course, the drone solution is just a bandage on a wider problem of poor transportation

215
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,460
infrastructure in Rwanda and other developing countries but, at least in the long period

216
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:31,020
of time a developing country waits to be developed, drone technology might be an effective solution

217
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,620
for improving medical logistics fast.

218
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,620
There are loads of interesting physics that go into how drones like those flying in Rwanda

219
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
work.

220
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,920
For example, with a quadcopter, there's a theoretical limit to how large a battery

221
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,000
a drone can have since eventually, the extra power needed to carry the extra weight of

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,360
the battery is greater than the extra power the extra battery provides.

223
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,120
Brilliant's classical mechanics course teaches you how to calculate what the maximum theoretical

224
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,720
flying time, using this principle, would be for a DJI Mavic Proâ€”of course in addition

225
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
to plenty of other useful physics concepts.

226
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,180
Like all Brilliant's courses, this one teaches you the small, intuitive concepts behind the

227
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,000
big subjects and then links them all together so that you can truly understand what you're

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,700
learningâ€”you don't just memorize procedures and facts.

229
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,880
If you're at all interested in logic, computer memory, number theory, quantum computing,
