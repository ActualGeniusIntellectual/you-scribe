00:09.380 --> 00:11.360
Modern medicine requires blood.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.700
It is a crucial element to the successful treatment of countless conditions.

00:15.700 --> 00:20.120
Blood transfusions are by far the most common procedure performed in most hospitals.

00:20.120 --> 00:24.560
In fact, they are so routine that even ambulance EMTs are now performing them in the field

00:24.560 --> 00:26.160
for traumatic injuries.

00:26.160 --> 00:30.620
The only problem is that, at least right now, the blood we use for human transfusions

00:30.620 --> 00:33.120
has to come from humans.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.920
Synthetic blood substitutes are under development but for now, real, donated human blood is

00:37.920 --> 00:39.360
all we can use.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.380
This blood, though, has a shelf life.

00:41.380 --> 00:45.060
Red blood cells, the most commonly transfused blood product, have a government mandated

00:45.060 --> 00:49.680
shelf life of 42 days in the US, 35 days in Europe, and similar numbers in the rest of

00:49.680 --> 00:50.680
the world.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.200
There's even some research suggesting that red blood cells deteriorate in quality after

00:54.200 --> 00:58.840
as little as 21 days so there's a big focus on getting them from donor to recipient as

00:58.840 --> 01:00.540
quickly as possible.

01:00.540 --> 01:04.900
Even 21 days probably seems like plenty of time but huge quantities of blood are taken

01:04.900 --> 01:09.640
from huge numbers of individuals and there are plenty of steps in between donation and

01:09.640 --> 01:10.640
transfusion.

01:10.640 --> 01:14.960
In developed countries like the UK, this supply chain works quite similarly to any other.

01:14.960 --> 01:19.640
The NHS Blood and Transplant Division manages the process for England and Wales.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.640
About 90% of their blood comes from donations given in their mobile blood banks that visit

01:23.640 --> 01:27.060
schools, community centers, sports clubs, and other locations.

01:27.060 --> 01:31.480
Donors are first screened verbally and through a hemoglobin test then a single unit of blood,

01:31.480 --> 01:33.680
470 milliliters, is taken.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.480
After a day of collection, product is taken back to the nearest of 13 processing centers.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.160
Over the following days, the blood is placed on a centrifuge where it separates into red

01:42.160 --> 01:43.880
blood cells and plasma.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.600
There are then additional tests to determine blood type and to assure it's safe to transfuse

01:47.600 --> 01:50.640
and then is packaged up and sent to hospitals via truck.

01:50.640 --> 01:55.120
As a whole, NHS Blood and Transplant aims to have between 40,000 and 50,000 units of

01:55.120 --> 01:59.080
blood in their system at any given time to deal with surges in demand.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.400
While red blood cells will last for about a month, platelets and some other blood products

02:02.400 --> 02:06.200
will last for less than a week so this whole process has to be sped up.

02:06.200 --> 02:10.520
Of course, there are other products that require fast transportation like fresh fish and flowers

02:10.520 --> 02:14.600
but the difference between these two is that if fish and flowers run out, people complain.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.200
If blood products run out, people die.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.800
Stockout just is not possible in the blood supply chain which means countries have to

02:20.800 --> 02:24.920
have enough blood in their system to deal with surges in demand associated with situations

02:24.920 --> 02:28.420
like natural disasters and other mass casualty events.

02:28.420 --> 02:31.940
Because of this, there is always a decent amount of waste.

02:31.940 --> 02:35.780
Blood will quite often expire before it's used but that's just a luxury rich countries

02:35.780 --> 02:37.760
like the UK have.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.260
Collecting and certifying blood isn't cheap but still, they're able to spend their way

02:41.260 --> 02:45.680
into creating enough blood products so that there are almost never stockouts.

02:45.680 --> 02:48.960
Less developed countries, though, don't have that luxury.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.120
Like the UK, the sub-Saharan African country of Rwanda operates a system of universal healthcare

02:54.120 --> 02:58.540
but, like the population, the government is not rich so it can't afford for much waste

02:58.540 --> 03:00.640
in its blood distribution system.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.700
The average resident of the UK makes about $40,000 US dollars per year.

03:04.700 --> 03:10.520
The average resident of Rwanda, on the other hand, makes just $720.

03:10.520 --> 03:15.560
Despite being a country of $12 million, Rwanda's economy is about the same size as the small

03:15.560 --> 03:17.280
British city of Plymouth.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.400
There's an anomaly in the country's indicators, though.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.640
It sits as the 17th poorest country in sub-Saharan Africa, well in the bottom half, although,

03:25.640 --> 03:29.400
in terms of life expectancy, it's tied for fourth best.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.120
Rwanda has been identified as having one of the best healthcare systems in Africa.

03:34.120 --> 03:39.400
In fact, its 67-year life expectancy is higher than that of some far richer African countries

03:39.400 --> 03:41.460
like Namibia and South Africa.

03:41.460 --> 03:45.620
The reason behind this no doubt has a lot to do with the fact that Rwanda, uncharacteristically

03:45.620 --> 03:49.660
for a poor African country, has a universal healthcare system where everyone has access

03:49.660 --> 03:54.660
to hospitals at an affordable or no cost but, in addition, some have attributed Rwanda's

03:54.660 --> 03:57.860
healthcare success to its willingness to embrace innovation.

03:57.860 --> 04:01.780
One of the most visible of these innovations has to do with how the country's hospitals

04:01.780 --> 04:02.780
get their blood.

04:02.780 --> 04:06.700
They've outsourced much of the country's blood delivery to a company called Zipline

04:06.700 --> 04:11.080
and Zipline delivers blood to hospitals across Rwanda by drone.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.240
This is one of the world's first commercial applications of drone delivery.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.320
While companies like Google and Amazon are testing drone delivery in developed countries,

04:19.320 --> 04:24.400
Rwanda, a developing country, already has a full-scale, nearly country-wide drone delivery

04:24.400 --> 04:27.280
system in service right now.

04:27.280 --> 04:28.920
How it works is this.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.720
The drones currently service 21 hospitals in the western half of the country.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.880
The closest is just 2.5 miles or 4 kilometers from Zipline's facility in Muhanga with

04:36.880 --> 04:40.320
the furthest being about 50 miles or 80 kilometers away.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.480
Many of these hospitals can place an order with Zipline pretty much in any way they can—email,

04:44.480 --> 04:47.680
text, phone, whatsapp, anything.

04:47.680 --> 04:51.200
Within this building, the individual sitting on the left takes orders, passes information

04:51.200 --> 04:54.940
onto the next person in the process, and stays in contact with the hospital throughout the

04:54.940 --> 04:57.820
process to let them know when their delivery will arrive.

04:57.820 --> 05:01.440
The individual on the right is then in charge of packaging up the delivery.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.200
Zipline's blood products are delivered to them by road from the Rwandan health system

05:05.200 --> 05:07.040
so they have a supply on hand.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.720
The product is packaged into one of these boxes.

05:09.720 --> 05:14.320
The whole process is designed to be as simple as possible so these boxes are single use.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.360
They're assembled on-site from cardboard, bubble wrap, and tape with a parachute being

05:18.360 --> 05:19.680
made from paper.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.000
That way, nobody has to drive out to hospitals to pick parachutes and boxes up.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.760
From there, the boxes pass through the window and a bell is rung to let the next person

05:27.760 --> 05:29.340
know the delivery is ready.

05:29.340 --> 05:33.300
The delivery is brought over to a ready drone, an app is used to scan QR codes to verify

05:33.300 --> 05:37.500
the delivery and drone, then the delivery is placed in the body of the drone.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.260
The drone is then picked up and brought over to the catapult.

05:40.260 --> 05:44.120
Meanwhile, another operator comes over and fixes the wings on the drone while another

05:44.120 --> 05:45.780
places the battery pack in.

05:45.780 --> 05:49.900
The drone is now almost ready for flight but first the operators perform a visual inspection

05:49.900 --> 05:54.340
for damage and use an app to check to be sure that all moving components are working.

05:54.340 --> 05:57.620
During this whole process, someone else is sitting in what's known as the crow's

05:57.620 --> 06:00.060
nest performing another crucial step.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.940
This individual is essentially air traffic control for Zipline.

06:02.940 --> 06:06.380
They're in charge of the drones while they're flying so the first step is to coordinate

06:06.380 --> 06:09.980
with Rwandan air traffic control to make sure they have clearance to fly.

06:09.980 --> 06:12.200
Now, Rwandan airspace is not busy.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.140
In fact, Zipline has about as many daily flights as Kigali Airport, the main airport in the

06:16.140 --> 06:20.380
country, so it's rare not to gain clearance immediately but still, this individual calls

06:20.380 --> 06:22.100
into Kigali to be sure.

06:22.100 --> 06:25.620
From there, they give clearance to the catapult operator to launch and the catapult operator

06:25.620 --> 06:28.580
makes sure nobody is standing in front of the launch site.

06:28.580 --> 06:32.180
There are quite often children on the other side of the fence watching the goings on.

06:32.180 --> 06:36.220
From there, they press the green button, an electric motor spins, pulls the catapult,

06:36.220 --> 06:39.620
and the drone reaches takeoff speed in a fraction of a second.

06:39.620 --> 06:42.540
Once in flight, the drone follows a pre-set flight path.

06:42.540 --> 06:47.900
Now, the drone is autonomous—it flies itself—but it has no decision-making authority.

06:47.900 --> 06:51.760
It flies high enough where it doesn't require any obstacle avoidance ability and, if it

06:51.760 --> 06:55.080
needs to hold for a minute to wait for air traffic to clear, it's told by the controller

06:55.080 --> 06:57.220
to enter a pre-set holding pattern.

06:57.220 --> 07:00.200
There are few weather conditions that these drones can't fly through.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.260
They can handle severe wind, rain, and lightning, but if they can't make it to their destination,

07:04.300 --> 07:07.740
they can also use one of these pre-set holding patterns to turn around.

07:07.740 --> 07:11.540
While the drones have improved greatly since a few years ago, a critical fault does happen

07:11.540 --> 07:13.780
every few hundred or so flights.

07:13.780 --> 07:17.720
In this case, the drone has a built-in parachute that it triggers itself to safely fall back

07:17.720 --> 07:18.900
to the ground.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.380
Crucially, no one has ever been injured by a zipline drone.

07:22.380 --> 07:26.500
If for any reason a drone needs to stop flying immediately, such as if zipline were to receive

07:26.500 --> 07:30.380
an order by air traffic control to immediately get out of certain airspace, the controller

07:30.380 --> 07:33.880
back at base could also manually trigger the parachute to deploy.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.540
From there, operators would go out and recover the drones by road.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.800
The drones fly at 60 miles or 100 kilometers per hour so they reach the nearest hospitals

07:41.800 --> 07:46.200
in mere minutes while the furthest hospitals, about 50 miles or 80 kilometers away, require

07:46.200 --> 07:48.840
about a 50 minute flight to reach.

07:48.840 --> 07:52.560
As a drone reaches its delivery point, the individual in charge of communication will

07:52.560 --> 07:54.340
text the hospital to let them know.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.840
The drone will approach the delivery point, circle around to lose altitude, then fly a

07:57.840 --> 08:03.160
few hundred feet over a predetermined landing spot, open his belly doors, and drop the package.

08:03.160 --> 08:07.500
The parachute will slow its fall but impact is also softened by the bubble wrap inside.

08:07.500 --> 08:11.600
From there, the blood product has arrived and hospital staff just walk outside to collect

08:11.600 --> 08:12.600
it.

08:12.600 --> 08:16.440
For the nearest sites, these blood deliveries arrive in about 15 minutes ready to be transfused

08:16.440 --> 08:18.700
into patients critically in need.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.600
But the process isn't over yet.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.620
The drone gains altitude, flies back towards the zipline site, then circles again to lose

08:24.620 --> 08:25.620
altitude.

08:25.620 --> 08:28.760
Now, you'll notice these drones have no wheels.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.200
That would add unnecessary weight and complexity.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.880
Once they've reached a precise altitude, the drone will come in against the wind, about

08:34.880 --> 08:38.500
15 feet or 5 meters above the ground, then bam.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.840
As quickly as the drone launched, it's landed.

08:40.840 --> 08:45.280
A tiny hook on the back of the drone catches a wire mid-air then the drone swings to a

08:45.280 --> 08:46.280
stop.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.640
The level of precision needed to make this landing process work is remarkable and is

08:49.640 --> 08:52.600
a testament to how far drone technology has come.

08:52.600 --> 08:56.320
The operators take the wings and batteries off, put the drone back on its stand, and

08:56.320 --> 08:59.040
it's ready to go again just like that.

08:59.080 --> 09:04.460
Now, Rwanda is not a large country physically—it's far smaller than the UK—so you might wonder

09:04.460 --> 09:08.440
why they can't just rely on blood delivery by road like the UK.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.720
For one, Rwanda's road infrastructure is lacking.

09:11.720 --> 09:15.660
While the major roads are paved and in good quality, the majority of the country's roads

09:15.660 --> 09:16.680
are dirt.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.840
When it's dry these roads work alright, but Rwanda sees two significant rainy seasons

09:20.840 --> 09:25.800
from February to June and September to December when there are heavy rains almost every day.

09:25.800 --> 09:30.440
With this, these dirt roads can become impassable for days due to floods and mud.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.900
One solution could be to stock rural hospitals with plenty of blood products to last through

09:33.900 --> 09:37.760
periods when trucks can't get to them, but that would lead to heavy wastage and safe

09:37.760 --> 09:39.600
processed blood isn't cheap.

09:39.600 --> 09:43.580
It would also prevent the usage of platelets and plasma which only have shelf lives of

09:43.580 --> 09:44.880
under a week.

09:44.880 --> 09:48.840
Therefore, the drones make it so that, no matter the conditions, any hospital in the

09:48.840 --> 09:51.960
network can receive red blood products in under an hour.

09:51.960 --> 09:56.040
While most deliveries just serve to restock these sites, about a third are for emergency

09:56.040 --> 09:59.920
situations where a hospital is out of stock of a particular blood product that a patient

09:59.920 --> 10:00.920
needs.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.040
Now, the potential applications of this type of technology stretch far beyond its current

10:05.040 --> 10:06.040
application.

10:06.040 --> 10:10.280
While the drones currently deliver just blood, Zipline is testing delivery of about 500 other

10:10.280 --> 10:14.800
medical products including bandages, medicines, almost anything a hospital could need so that

10:14.800 --> 10:18.320
if a hospital is missing something, they can get it in at most an hour.

10:18.320 --> 10:21.800
They're also preparing to put a drone base online in the eastern half of the country

10:21.800 --> 10:24.160
to have nearly nationwide coverage.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.040
One potential application of having two bases within range of each other is that if one

10:28.040 --> 10:31.760
base runs out of a product that is needed on its side of the country, a drone can be

10:31.760 --> 10:36.460
loaded from the other base, fly over, land, have its battery replaced, and launched again

10:36.460 --> 10:38.640
to fly to its final delivery point.

10:38.640 --> 10:43.040
Rwanda is quite a well-suited test case for this drone technology since it is fairly small

10:43.040 --> 10:47.140
and densely populated but this feasibility of transferring drones between bases could

10:47.140 --> 10:50.760
also help create a network structure that works for less dense countries.

10:50.760 --> 10:54.860
The Ghanaian parliament recently approved an agreement with Zipline to expand into their

10:54.860 --> 10:55.860
country.

10:55.860 --> 10:59.980
Ghana is rather tall and narrow with density, as a rule, more or less decreasing as one

10:59.980 --> 11:00.980
goes north.

11:00.980 --> 11:04.540
While the exact service areas and details have yet to be announced, what could work

11:04.540 --> 11:08.560
on a conceptual level would be to have a number of bases within range of each other.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.740
The rarest, most expensive, or lowest demand products such as platelets and plasma could

11:12.740 --> 11:17.080
be stored at the southernmost base and, if needed, could be sent north to the less busy

11:17.080 --> 11:21.360
bases serving less dense and less busy areas by a drone stopping at each base and having

11:21.360 --> 11:22.800
their batteries swapped.

11:22.800 --> 11:27.340
Lastly, one other potential application for these drones is for disaster relief.

11:27.340 --> 11:30.800
The bare basics needed to start operations can be packed into a single shipping container

11:30.800 --> 11:32.880
and assembled in just a few days.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.200
The system is designed for places like Rwanda where road infrastructure is lacking and after

11:37.200 --> 11:41.300
major natural disasters, road infrastructure often is lacking.

11:41.300 --> 11:45.420
It could be quite impactful to be able to deploy a relatively low-cost, high-frequency

11:45.420 --> 11:49.080
delivery system over a disaster area using drones like these.

11:49.080 --> 11:52.900
While the Zipline system is not currently set up for fast deployment in disaster relief

11:52.900 --> 11:56.360
situations, the company has considered working on this for the future so they could set up

11:56.360 --> 11:59.900
a base, plan flight paths, and begin operations quickly.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.620
So far, Zipline's drones have, in their initial deployment in Rwanda, served their

12:03.620 --> 12:08.460
mission effectively of reliably linking rural hospitals to modern medical product.

12:08.460 --> 12:12.160
Having proved themselves with this first deployment, the company is now entering a phase of rather

12:12.160 --> 12:16.160
fast expansion both in the scope of their service in Rwanda and the number of countries

12:16.160 --> 12:17.460
served overall.

12:17.460 --> 12:22.100
Of course, the drone solution is just a bandage on a wider problem of poor transportation

12:22.100 --> 12:26.460
infrastructure in Rwanda and other developing countries but, at least in the long period

12:26.460 --> 12:31.020
of time a developing country waits to be developed, drone technology might be an effective solution

12:31.020 --> 12:34.620
for improving medical logistics fast.

12:34.620 --> 12:38.620
There are loads of interesting physics that go into how drones like those flying in Rwanda

12:38.620 --> 12:39.620
work.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.920
For example, with a quadcopter, there's a theoretical limit to how large a battery

12:42.920 --> 12:47.000
a drone can have since eventually, the extra power needed to carry the extra weight of

12:47.000 --> 12:50.360
the battery is greater than the extra power the extra battery provides.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.120
Brilliant's classical mechanics course teaches you how to calculate what the maximum theoretical

12:54.120 --> 12:58.720
flying time, using this principle, would be for a DJI Mavic Pro—of course in addition

12:58.720 --> 13:01.040
to plenty of other useful physics concepts.

13:01.040 --> 13:05.180
Like all Brilliant's courses, this one teaches you the small, intuitive concepts behind the

13:05.180 --> 13:10.000
big subjects and then links them all together so that you can truly understand what you're

13:10.000 --> 13:12.700
learning—you don't just memorize procedures and facts.

13:12.700 --> 13:16.880
If you're at all interested in logic, computer memory, number theory, quantum computing,

13:16.880 --> 13:20.700
or any of their dozens of other courses, you can try a few of them for free by signing

13:20.700 --> 13:25.480
