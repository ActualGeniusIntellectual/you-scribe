00:00.000 --> 00:05.340
Let's say I had an apple, and you had an orange, and I wanted an orange, and you wanted

00:05.340 --> 00:10.680
an apple. We could trade, and both of us would end up happier than when we started.

00:10.680 --> 00:14.560
But now let's say I had an apple tree, and you had an orange tree, and the apples from

00:14.560 --> 00:18.800
the apple tree were ready, but the oranges wouldn't ripen for another month. I could

00:18.800 --> 00:23.120
give you an apple now, and you could promise to give me an orange in a month, when they're

00:23.120 --> 00:26.960
ready, and both of us would end up happier than when we started.

00:26.960 --> 00:31.560
Although, maybe you didn't want an apple. Maybe you wanted a pear. But all I had to

00:31.560 --> 00:36.480
give was my apple, and I still wanted your orange. Well, maybe there was a third guy,

00:36.480 --> 00:42.160
a pear-laden guy, and he wanted an apple. So I give him my apple, he gives you his pear,

00:42.160 --> 00:45.960
and you promise to give me your orange in a month, and we all end up happier than when

00:45.960 --> 00:46.960
we started.

00:46.960 --> 00:50.940
But then maybe we start to trade bigger quantities, and maybe we add more people with different

00:50.940 --> 00:54.300
fruits on different harvest schedules, and maybe we decide that certain popular fruits

00:54.300 --> 00:57.280
are worth more, and two of one equals one of the other, and one of the other equals

00:57.280 --> 01:01.820
three of the third, and it all starts to get just a little bit complicated.

01:01.820 --> 01:06.740
So, we simplify. Instead of trading physical fruit for physical fruit, we trade physical

01:06.740 --> 01:12.100
fruit for fruit credits—clay balls with a generic fruit symbol carved into them. If

01:12.100 --> 01:16.400
I trade an apple into the system, I get a credit, and when I want that orange, I trade

01:16.400 --> 01:19.660
the credit in—nobody has to keep track of what I'm owed.

01:19.660 --> 01:23.980
Now that we have this system going, we might as well add vegetables into the mix. Sure,

01:24.660 --> 01:28.420
it's not fruit, but we want veggie sometimes, and the veggie farmers want fruit too, so

01:28.420 --> 01:30.540
the system still works.

01:30.540 --> 01:35.060
Naturally, as the system develops and develops with more and more items and more and more

01:35.060 --> 01:39.400
complexity, we start to feel that these fruit credits have value, even though they merely

01:39.400 --> 01:44.560
represent theoretical value. But that theoretical value can be turned into real value, and so

01:44.560 --> 01:49.080
in a way, the clay balls—the representation of theoretical value that translates into

01:49.080 --> 01:52.780
real value—hold real value in and of themselves.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.860
So, someone starts a business where they'll keep your fruit credits safe for you, free

01:56.860 --> 02:02.540
of charge. Better yet, they'll pay you to keep your credits safe. It sounds like a scam,

02:02.540 --> 02:06.700
and maybe it is, but you take the risk and deposit a thousand credits.

02:06.700 --> 02:11.460
Elsewhere, in order to grow more watermelons this year, and therefore earn more fruit credits,

02:11.460 --> 02:15.780
a watermelon farmer needs more credits than she has to exchange for an irrigation system.

02:15.780 --> 02:20.460
So, this new credit storage business offers to give her 7,500 credits if she promises

02:20.460 --> 02:24.800
to give 9,000 back in a year. This seems like a safe bet since she's already a successful

02:24.800 --> 02:28.060
watermelon farmer, and it's worth it for her since she'll get the new irrigation

02:28.060 --> 02:31.500
system, and worth it to this new fruit credit safeguarding business since they'll get

02:31.500 --> 02:35.180
more credits, and everyone ends up happier than when they started.

02:35.180 --> 02:40.060
Meanwhile, you're told that you can take your credits out at any time, and you can,

02:40.060 --> 02:44.540
even if they only kept 250 of them on hand. That's because there are nine more farmers

02:44.540 --> 02:48.380
that deposited their thousand credits too, and even if the safeguarding business only

02:48.380 --> 02:52.460
kept a quarter of them, a quarter of all deposits is much more than your thousand,

02:52.460 --> 02:57.020
and the chances of everyone wanting their credits at the same time is negligibly low.

02:57.020 --> 03:02.880
So, this is a free money machine. You make money, the bank makes money, and the watermelon

03:02.880 --> 03:11.380
farmer makes money. Everyone makes money. But wait, everyone makes money? You, the bank,

03:11.380 --> 03:15.460
and the watermelon farmer end up with more money than when you started, so where did

03:15.460 --> 03:17.060
it come from?

03:17.060 --> 03:21.100
If we turn this into a closed loop, where no money enters or exits the system, we can

03:21.100 --> 03:26.300
track down the source. So, ten people with 10,000 credits each deposit a thousand, meaning

03:26.300 --> 03:31.620
the bank now has 10,000. The bank lends those 7,500 out to the watermelon farmer, meaning

03:31.620 --> 03:36.980
it now holds 2,500. She pays that 7,500 to one of the ten depositors for an irrigation

03:36.980 --> 03:41.360
system they're selling. One growing season later, the farmer has 9,000 watermelons that

03:41.360 --> 03:45.180
she brings to the market, and sells 900 of them to each of the same group of ten that

03:45.180 --> 03:50.220
put their money into the bank. They now each have 9,100 credits, a thousand of which sit

03:50.220 --> 03:54.700
in the bank. Meanwhile, the farmer has 9,000 what she gives to the bank, meaning it now

03:54.700 --> 04:01.500
holds 11,500 credits. So, the farmer has nothing, the ten individuals have 98,500 total, and

04:01.500 --> 04:09.420
the bank has 11,500, meaning there are now 110,000 credits in the system. Once again,

04:09.420 --> 04:11.820
money has appeared out of thin air.

04:12.460 --> 04:17.940
So, its source. In the very first step, 10,000 credit deposits go into the bank, but the

04:17.940 --> 04:24.100
ten individuals still each have $10,000. It's just that 1,000 of it's in the bank. That's

04:24.100 --> 04:27.820
not the bank's money, so the 10,000 sitting in their vault isn't theirs, which means

04:27.820 --> 04:35.140
the money is created exactly… now. The moment that loan goes out, new money has appeared.

04:35.140 --> 04:39.700
The original depositors still have their 100,000 credits, because with the way the fractional

04:39.700 --> 04:45.900
reserve banking system works, they can all, on an individual level, withdraw their 10,000.

04:45.900 --> 04:52.540
But simultaneously, the watermelon farmer has 7,500 very real credits. If you have a

04:52.540 --> 04:57.640
roommate that you agree to share your blender with, only one blender physically exists,

04:57.640 --> 05:01.660
but two blenders' worth of value is being extracted from it, because you're both using

05:01.660 --> 05:06.740
it just as much as you'd use your own, dedicated blender. That's essentially what's happening

05:06.740 --> 05:11.620
with money, except that with money, we track the per person value, rather than the per

05:11.620 --> 05:16.060
blender value. Now, it'd be easy to argue that we can't consider the bank to have

05:16.060 --> 05:20.660
created 10,000 credits, and that's fair, because the system wouldn't work if it lent

05:20.660 --> 05:25.780
10,000, because it couldn't give the original depositors their money back. But it does work

05:25.780 --> 05:31.380
when they give away 7,500—a 25% reserve ratio is very typical in a fractional reserve

05:31.380 --> 05:37.180
banking system—so we can at least say 7,500 was created. You could still argue that the

05:37.180 --> 05:42.180
7,500 isn't actually money since it's eventually owed back to the depositors, except

05:42.180 --> 05:48.460
that, if you trust and engage in the global financial system, that's not what you believe.

05:48.460 --> 05:52.340
When you receive a loan, you can take out that money in cash, and when you deposit money

05:52.340 --> 05:57.060
in a bank account, you can take out that money in cash—it is very real money, representing

05:57.060 --> 06:03.020
very real value. This is exactly why answering the question of how much money exists is so

06:03.020 --> 06:07.340
tough. There are at least six different commonly accepted definitions, incorporating different

06:07.340 --> 06:12.140
combinations of currency, demand deposits, traveler's checks, time deposits, and more,

06:12.140 --> 06:15.860
and this means of money creation is one of the primary activities that central banks

06:15.860 --> 06:20.340
like the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, or Bank of Japan seek to administer and regulate.

06:20.340 --> 06:23.940
They're in charge of telling banks how much money they have to keep in reserves, which

06:23.940 --> 06:28.180
throttles how much money appears out of thin air through banks' lending process.

06:28.180 --> 06:33.060
Of course, the aspect to take note of is the fact that money is created when it moves—money

06:33.060 --> 06:38.880
is never created while it's sitting still. So, back in 1867, when moving money was tough

06:38.880 --> 06:43.420
and banks were rudimentary, physical currency still pretty well correlated to the total

06:43.420 --> 06:49.300
supply of money—most dollars were represented by a physical bill or coin—but since then,

06:49.300 --> 06:54.900
well, things have changed. Abstraction helps money move. Adding paper

06:54.900 --> 07:00.340
stand-ins for precious, rare minerals speeds up the transportation of funds and transactions.

07:00.340 --> 07:04.940
Abstraction helps money grow, too, as a bank's ability to loan money provides its customers

07:04.940 --> 07:10.280
the assets to then create value. Abstraction, however, doesn't alone move money from one

07:10.280 --> 07:14.700
bank to the next, one town to the next, one state to the next, or one country to the next

07:14.700 --> 07:20.660
like it does today. That required standardization. Before the Civil War, there were thousands

07:20.660 --> 07:24.940
of different types of paper money backed by all sorts of private and public institutions

07:24.940 --> 07:30.820
in the US. Say, for example, a watchmaker from Waltham, Massachusetts in 1857 went into

07:30.820 --> 07:36.060
their bank to withdraw this $20 bill to buy some machinery down in Brookline. This isn't

07:36.060 --> 07:41.260
the $20 bill anyone today is used to—this is a Waltham Bank $20 bill, redeemable in

07:41.260 --> 07:46.220
gold at only the Waltham Bank but of uncertain value to anyone outside of the Waltham Bank.

07:46.220 --> 07:50.980
Now, while the watchmaker's not taking on the risk or inconvenience of carrying $20

07:50.980 --> 07:54.740
worth of gold, there's also no guarantee that the merchant in Brookline will take the

07:54.740 --> 07:59.380
note from a bank so far out of their way. Perhaps, because of the distance, they'll

07:59.380 --> 08:04.820
tack on a fee for the inconvenience of cashing the note, and say the machinery is now $23.

08:04.820 --> 08:08.560
Or perhaps the watchmaker gets lucky, and they are only one of many business relations

08:08.560 --> 08:12.120
the Brookline merchant keeps in the Waltham area, then maybe the merchant will accept

08:12.120 --> 08:15.600
the Waltham dollars knowing they'll be able to use the bill in the future.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.520
Regardless of the fate of the Waltham watchmaker, what their predicament underscores is that

08:19.520 --> 08:24.360
money, when in many different forms from many different places, was hard to move, hard to

08:24.360 --> 08:28.740
transact with, and hard to transfer outside of one's immediate community.

08:28.740 --> 08:34.080
All this changed with the National Currency Acts of the 1860s. Out went thousands of separately

08:34.080 --> 08:39.120
backed private bank notes, in came nationally chartered banks, and so began a new era of

08:39.120 --> 08:44.000
money moving with a new means with which to do it—the modern check.

08:44.000 --> 08:48.960
Under the new rules, all nationally chartered banks had to carry about 25% of their liabilities

08:48.960 --> 08:53.600
in reserve—in other words, of all the money they were good for, a quarter of that needed

08:53.600 --> 08:58.920
to be held in gold in the basement. Crucially, though, the smaller banks, or country banks,

08:58.920 --> 09:03.320
could hold these reserves in the central reserve cities, or the few big banks.

09:03.320 --> 09:08.280
Effectively, the two banks were now connected—someone could now take a check from their local bank,

09:08.280 --> 09:11.760
head into the city and buy supplies, and that check could then be settled at the larger

09:11.760 --> 09:16.360
correspondent bank without any gold having to move outside the vault. And not only were

09:16.360 --> 09:20.160
these two banks connected, countless small banks were now all linked together through

09:20.160 --> 09:23.120
that correspondent bank functioning as a hub.

09:23.120 --> 09:27.600
This simple connection had major consequences—it allowed a customer to move money regionally

09:27.600 --> 09:31.880
without the hassle of navigating a maze of domestic exchange rates, thus stimulating

09:31.880 --> 09:36.440
growth, and without the slow and risky necessity of moving actual coins or cash from bank to

09:36.440 --> 09:38.880
bank, making the process quicker.

09:38.880 --> 09:43.000
In this environment, armed with a Waltham check rather than Waltham dollars, a watchmaker

09:43.000 --> 09:46.680
could pay for their supplies, the merchant could deposit their check at the Brookline

09:46.680 --> 09:51.000
bank, and the Brookline bank, in turn, assuming because of their proximity they share a correspondent

09:51.000 --> 09:54.640
bank, would send the check to the correspondent which then would balance each bank's funds

09:54.640 --> 09:56.680
by moving money across the basement.

09:56.680 --> 10:01.700
Now, this process at the time was far from efficient—especially when banks didn't

10:01.700 --> 10:05.820
share immediate correspondent banks. When a check moved money between banks without

10:05.820 --> 10:10.480
a direct link, they had to find a third-party bank, or in some cases multiple banks, to

10:10.480 --> 10:15.740
bridge the gap and connect them with a correspondent, racking up fees, delays, and postage all along

10:15.740 --> 10:21.680
the way. Take for example this check from 1898 for $43.56, which was deposited at the

10:21.680 --> 10:25.600
Second National Bank of Hoboken, New Jersey, before Second National then sent it to Harvey

10:25.600 --> 10:30.000
Fisk & Sons, who sent it to the Globe National Bank of Boston, who sent it to the First National

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
Bank of Tonawanda, who sent it to the National Exchange Bank of Albany, who then sent it

10:34.000 --> 10:38.200
to a bank in Port Jefferson, who then sent it here, who then sent it here, who then sent

10:38.200 --> 10:43.320
it here, who then sent it here, who then sent it here, where it was finally drawn.

10:43.320 --> 10:48.360
Still, while inefficient, these early checks were a critical stepping stone in standardizing

10:48.360 --> 10:53.720
and moving an increasingly abstract form of money—bank account totals denoted in dollars,

10:53.720 --> 10:58.240
not gold. The use of checks, and the ease of their accounting, took a major step forward

10:58.240 --> 11:03.200
with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which split the nation into 12 separate regions,

11:03.200 --> 11:06.600
and tasked each regional Federal Reserve Bank with filling the role of clearinghouse for

11:06.600 --> 11:12.000
all regional checks. This centralization streamlined processing, as the bank could now credit a

11:12.000 --> 11:16.080
merchant's account and know exactly which Federal Reserve Bank to send it to. It also

11:16.080 --> 11:20.140
codified a critically important function that would allow money to move farther, and become

11:20.140 --> 11:25.020
increasingly abstract in the decades to come—rigorous accounting.

11:25.020 --> 11:30.180
In the early 1900s, checks were still rather rare, and their use remained mostly regional.

11:30.180 --> 11:35.020
Then came the 50s. Now, Americans were making more money than ever, spending more money

11:35.020 --> 11:40.820
than ever, and had more bank accounts than ever. From 1943 to 1952, national check use

11:40.820 --> 11:45.260
doubled from $4 to $8 billion a year, and through multi-step proofing and processing,

11:45.260 --> 11:49.980
American banks were wading through some 69 million checks every day.

11:49.980 --> 11:54.300
Banks were drowning under the pressure. Branches closed at two in the afternoon to shift all

11:54.300 --> 11:58.940
work to matching signatures, running the adding machine, double-checking the math, and packaging

11:58.940 --> 12:03.860
the checks for shipping to the Federal Reserve. The work was grueling—most clerical staff

12:03.860 --> 12:08.980
at banks quit within a year—but it was absolutely necessary. With more money passing through

12:08.980 --> 12:13.460
their hands than ever before, they had to be as accurate as humanly possible.

12:14.460 --> 12:18.160
Relief, though, came in the form of a computer the size of a room designed by the Stanford

12:18.160 --> 12:22.820
Research Institute, funded by the Bank of America, and built by IBM. They called it

12:22.820 --> 12:28.180
the Electronic Recording Machine Accounting, or IRMA, and it transformed banking. Before

12:28.180 --> 12:33.020
IRMA, checks were processed at every bank branch, they came in all sizes, and they weren't

12:33.020 --> 12:37.060
identified by bank account numbers. To move the process of sorting checks to the computer,

12:37.060 --> 12:41.060
they'd need to be the same size, and they'd need numbers rather than names to be organized

12:41.060 --> 12:45.460
by. Once those standards were adopted, checks were entered into the computer, which read

12:45.460 --> 12:49.440
the magnetic ink, and if the account belonged to a Bank of America branch, IRMA would access

12:49.440 --> 12:54.380
the account stored in its 16x20 inch magnetic drum memory, check for any account holds,

12:54.380 --> 12:58.100
make sure the balance in the account was positive, draw the amount, tally the total, save the

12:58.100 --> 13:03.300
new balance, and print the new record. Were human eyes misread, and human hands mistyped,

13:03.300 --> 13:07.040
IRMA didn't, as the computer even went so far as to check the routing number by plugging

13:07.040 --> 13:10.580
the digits into this algorithm to ensure the checks' legitimacy.

13:11.100 --> 13:16.340
Now, the paper processing crisis that began in the 1950s was not solely a Bank of America

13:16.340 --> 13:21.340
problem—it was structural. From monthly insurance bills to tax returns to social security

13:21.340 --> 13:25.720
checks, no matter how many sorting machines were added to the system, if every transaction

13:25.720 --> 13:30.140
took the form of a flimsy paper check that needed to physically pass from person to bank

13:30.140 --> 13:35.620
to fed to bank, then the paper avalanche simply couldn't be contained. So, payment systems

13:35.620 --> 13:40.180
went electronic, and the Automated Clearinghouse Network revolutionized the domestic movement

13:40.180 --> 13:44.780
of money when adopted in the 1970s. Where thousands of checks once poured into reserve

13:44.780 --> 13:49.740
banks and private clearinghouses every day, the ACH network now allowed for direct deposits,

13:49.740 --> 13:54.080
automatic payments, and ATM transactions. Now someone looking to pay their insurance

13:54.080 --> 13:57.780
premium could hand over their bank account information to the insurance company, the

13:57.780 --> 14:01.420
company's bank would then create an ACH entry requesting to withdraw money, the request

14:01.420 --> 14:05.140
would be processed by the ACH's operator, and the money would be debited from one account,

14:05.140 --> 14:08.460
and credited to the other, no check required.

14:08.460 --> 14:13.260
Of course, security and the ability to uphold accurate accounting were of paramount concern

14:13.260 --> 14:18.540
in an era before the internet. Companies adopted microdeposits as a means to verify bank accounts,

14:18.540 --> 14:23.620
Federal Reserve officials helped form a regulatory body called NATCHA, and in 1978 Congress passed

14:23.620 --> 14:27.360
the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit customer liability and protect them against

14:27.360 --> 14:33.220
wrong or fraudulent charges. The measures successfully erased consumer fears. Today,

14:33.220 --> 14:39.340
the ACH network moves over $50 trillion across 23 billion transfers a year.

14:39.340 --> 14:45.400
While ACH securely moves mountains of money stateside, its role ends where the US does.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.100
For international transfers, there's the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial

14:49.100 --> 14:54.940
Telecommunications, or SWIFT, which, like ACH, was established in the 70s to streamline payments,

14:54.940 --> 14:59.880
but at the international scale. SWIFT doesn't actually move money, but instead provides

14:59.880 --> 15:04.480
its 11,000 member banks a secure network and a standardized messaging format to send

15:04.480 --> 15:09.880
payment orders. Prior to SWIFT, international transfers lacked standardization, security,

15:09.880 --> 15:14.660
and accuracy. So, SWIFT started from scratch, organizing its member banks in a manner similar

15:14.660 --> 15:18.720
to the routing numbers on a check, assigning each an 8-to-11 character code that denotes

15:18.720 --> 15:23.920
bank name, country, location, and branch. The program also standardized how payments

15:23.920 --> 15:27.360
were communicated. They start with a bank code, but the payment instructions are outlined

15:27.360 --> 15:31.960
in an MT-103 document, which, as they're processed, can be tracked by the bank and,

15:31.960 --> 15:36.280
once the transaction is complete, will function as a receipt. Now, if someone's wiring money

15:36.280 --> 15:41.000
from the US, through, say, Bank of America, to Germany, through Deutsche Bank, rather

15:41.000 --> 15:45.520
than actually sending money, the MT-103 will tell Deutsche Bank how many dollars to pull

15:45.520 --> 15:49.820
from Bank of America's Nostra account held at Deutsche Bank, and convert them to Euros

15:49.820 --> 15:54.040
to be deposited into the recipient's account. Like correspondent banks settling checks in

15:54.040 --> 15:58.400
the early 1900s without taking the risk of shipping gold coins in the mail, SWIFT members

15:58.400 --> 16:03.800
are able to fulfill international transactions without actually moving money across oceans.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.460
Through its simplicity relative to programs before it, once a SWIFT transfer is initiated

16:07.460 --> 16:11.340
and then communicated through SWIFTnet's encrypted message system, a transfer is usually

16:11.340 --> 16:16.200
completed within 24 to 48 hours, with more complicated and multi-bank transactions accounting

16:16.200 --> 16:21.880
for some transfers taking longer. Still, even though SWIFT functions as a member-owned cooperative

16:21.880 --> 16:25.960
and therefore doesn't maximize profit, it's neither cheap nor easy to manage a

16:25.960 --> 16:31.320
global network capable of securely passing along more than 40 million messages a day.

16:31.320 --> 16:36.080
This cost is felt by member banks who pay to enter SWIFT, then pay SWIFT by the message—costs

16:36.080 --> 16:41.760
that add up and costs that trickle down, too. Today, each international transfer, be it

16:41.760 --> 16:46.120
part of everyday business or someone sending money to their family back home, usually gets

16:46.120 --> 16:50.320
tagged with a fee likely starting in the $40 range.

16:50.320 --> 16:54.260
Given the cost and complexity of transferring money, some have identified the opportunity

16:54.260 --> 16:59.780
of layering a simpler system on top of it. Wwise, for example, is one of the world's

16:59.780 --> 17:04.560
hottest fintech startups, focusing primarily on remittances. There are loads of low-to-medium

17:04.560 --> 17:08.720
income people working outside of their home country who pay those huge fees to send money

17:08.720 --> 17:13.600
to their families back home, but Wwise designed a system that almost entirely circumvents

17:13.600 --> 17:18.440
those intermediaries. Essentially, if someone in the US is sending $1,000 to someone in

17:18.440 --> 17:22.840
Australia, they actually transfer money into Wwise's American account, then the company

17:22.840 --> 17:27.400
instructs its Australian account to send the equivalent amount, minus fees, to the recipient.

17:27.400 --> 17:32.320
They're essentially a private market equivalent of SWIFT—it's a dead simple system that

17:32.320 --> 17:37.400
leads to the same end result, but with far less cost and complexity.

17:37.400 --> 17:42.300
Banks can't do this. You see, if Wwise messes up and sends the recipient money without debiting

17:42.300 --> 17:48.200
the sender, the company is out $1,000. If a bank messes up and gives the recipient $1,000

17:48.200 --> 17:54.240
without the sender being debited, $1,000 just appears out of nowhere. So that can't

17:54.240 --> 18:01.120
happen. It just simply can't. If it does, money breaks, our trust breaks, the system

18:01.120 --> 18:07.080
breaks. If money erroneously appears outside of the context in which we allow it to appear,

18:07.080 --> 18:10.560
then it's not functioning like its physical counterpart would.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.880
Money really is just a means of accounting. It's accounting for the fact that you owe

18:14.880 --> 18:18.720
me an orange, but if you give me the orange and I don't give you the fruit credit, then

18:18.720 --> 18:23.640
the system didn't work—the accounting failed. For the modern digital financial system

18:23.640 --> 18:28.800
to function at all, the process of transfer has to be as infallible as the process of

18:28.800 --> 18:33.560
handing a clay ball from one person to the next. Simulating physicality in a digital

18:33.560 --> 18:39.500
network as vast and distributed as the global financial system is incredibly complex, considering

18:39.500 --> 18:45.400
how complex this system itself is. These expensive, burdensome middlemen are the institutions

18:45.400 --> 18:51.220
that protect that simulated physicality, so without them, money is worthless.

18:51.220 --> 18:55.540
Alternatives are arising, most notably the blockchain, and central banks like the Federal

18:55.540 --> 18:59.780
Reserve are studying whether to introduce blockchain-based digital currencies, but for

18:59.780 --> 19:05.420
now, the world still runs on money, and money's value is all in the system's ability to

19:05.420 --> 19:07.500
account for it.

19:07.500 --> 19:13.540
Few things in the digital world are as finite as money, with one notable exception—domains.

19:13.540 --> 19:18.540
There is only one wendoverproductions.com, for example. That scarcity means domains have

19:18.540 --> 19:22.800
real value, and they especially have real value to you if you start a business, or a

19:22.800 --> 19:27.100
YouTube channel, or something where having the corresponding domain name matters.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.860
Hover can help with that. They're the domain marketplace that I've used to buy all of

19:30.860 --> 19:35.260
my domains, because they have fair and transparent pricing, a super quick purchasing process,

19:35.260 --> 19:40.200
and absolutely excellent customer support. Quite literally the moment we landed on Jetlag

19:40.200 --> 19:44.320
the Game as the name for our new channel, for example, I went on Hover and bought Jetlag

19:44.320 --> 19:48.460
the Game dot com, and if the dot com domain you want is already taken, Hover can still

19:48.460 --> 19:53.360
help because they offer over 400 unique domain extensions, allowing you to create combinations

19:53.360 --> 19:57.560
like our wendover.productions domain. And to top it all off, you can set up an email

19:57.560 --> 20:02.200
using your new domain in less than a minute, allowing you to drop the at gmail or at iCloud

20:02.200 --> 20:03.920
a bit for something of your own.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.960
All in all, Hover is just simply the best place to buy domains online, and it's made

20:07.960 --> 20:11.700
even better by the fact that clicking the button on screen or heading to hover.com slash

20:11.700 --> 20:16.080
wendover will get you 10% off your first purchase, and help support the channel while you're

20:16.080 --> 20:16.580
at it.
