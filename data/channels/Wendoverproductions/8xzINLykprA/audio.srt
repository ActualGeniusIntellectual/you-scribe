1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,340
Let's say I had an apple, and you had an orange, and I wanted an orange, and you wanted

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,680
an apple. We could trade, and both of us would end up happier than when we started.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,560
But now let's say I had an apple tree, and you had an orange tree, and the apples from

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,800
the apple tree were ready, but the oranges wouldn't ripen for another month. I could

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,120
give you an apple now, and you could promise to give me an orange in a month, when they're

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,960
ready, and both of us would end up happier than when we started.

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,560
Although, maybe you didn't want an apple. Maybe you wanted a pear. But all I had to

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,480
give was my apple, and I still wanted your orange. Well, maybe there was a third guy,

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,160
a pear-laden guy, and he wanted an apple. So I give him my apple, he gives you his pear,

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,960
and you promise to give me your orange in a month, and we all end up happier than when

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
we started.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,940
But then maybe we start to trade bigger quantities, and maybe we add more people with different

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,300
fruits on different harvest schedules, and maybe we decide that certain popular fruits

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,280
are worth more, and two of one equals one of the other, and one of the other equals

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,820
three of the third, and it all starts to get just a little bit complicated.

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,740
So, we simplify. Instead of trading physical fruit for physical fruit, we trade physical

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,100
fruit for fruit credits—clay balls with a generic fruit symbol carved into them. If

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,400
I trade an apple into the system, I get a credit, and when I want that orange, I trade

19
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,660
the credit in—nobody has to keep track of what I'm owed.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,980
Now that we have this system going, we might as well add vegetables into the mix. Sure,

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:28,420
it's not fruit, but we want veggie sometimes, and the veggie farmers want fruit too, so

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,540
the system still works.

23
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,060
Naturally, as the system develops and develops with more and more items and more and more

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,400
complexity, we start to feel that these fruit credits have value, even though they merely

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,560
represent theoretical value. But that theoretical value can be turned into real value, and so

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,080
in a way, the clay balls—the representation of theoretical value that translates into

27
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,780
real value—hold real value in and of themselves.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,860
So, someone starts a business where they'll keep your fruit credits safe for you, free

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,540
of charge. Better yet, they'll pay you to keep your credits safe. It sounds like a scam,

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,700
and maybe it is, but you take the risk and deposit a thousand credits.

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,460
Elsewhere, in order to grow more watermelons this year, and therefore earn more fruit credits,

32
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,780
a watermelon farmer needs more credits than she has to exchange for an irrigation system.

33
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,460
So, this new credit storage business offers to give her 7,500 credits if she promises

34
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,800
to give 9,000 back in a year. This seems like a safe bet since she's already a successful

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,060
watermelon farmer, and it's worth it for her since she'll get the new irrigation

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,500
system, and worth it to this new fruit credit safeguarding business since they'll get

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,180
more credits, and everyone ends up happier than when they started.

38
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,060
Meanwhile, you're told that you can take your credits out at any time, and you can,

39
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:44,540
even if they only kept 250 of them on hand. That's because there are nine more farmers

40
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,380
that deposited their thousand credits too, and even if the safeguarding business only

41
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,460
kept a quarter of them, a quarter of all deposits is much more than your thousand,

42
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,020
and the chances of everyone wanting their credits at the same time is negligibly low.

43
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,880
So, this is a free money machine. You make money, the bank makes money, and the watermelon

44
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:11,380
farmer makes money. Everyone makes money. But wait, everyone makes money? You, the bank,

45
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,460
and the watermelon farmer end up with more money than when you started, so where did

46
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,060
it come from?

47
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,100
If we turn this into a closed loop, where no money enters or exits the system, we can

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,300
track down the source. So, ten people with 10,000 credits each deposit a thousand, meaning

49
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,620
the bank now has 10,000. The bank lends those 7,500 out to the watermelon farmer, meaning

50
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,980
it now holds 2,500. She pays that 7,500 to one of the ten depositors for an irrigation

51
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,360
system they're selling. One growing season later, the farmer has 9,000 watermelons that

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,180
she brings to the market, and sells 900 of them to each of the same group of ten that

53
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,220
put their money into the bank. They now each have 9,100 credits, a thousand of which sit

54
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,700
in the bank. Meanwhile, the farmer has 9,000 what she gives to the bank, meaning it now

55
00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:01,500
holds 11,500 credits. So, the farmer has nothing, the ten individuals have 98,500 total, and

56
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:09,420
the bank has 11,500, meaning there are now 110,000 credits in the system. Once again,

57
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,820
money has appeared out of thin air.

58
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,940
So, its source. In the very first step, 10,000 credit deposits go into the bank, but the

59
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,100
ten individuals still each have $10,000. It's just that 1,000 of it's in the bank. That's

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,820
not the bank's money, so the 10,000 sitting in their vault isn't theirs, which means

61
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:35,140
the money is created exactly… now. The moment that loan goes out, new money has appeared.

62
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,700
The original depositors still have their 100,000 credits, because with the way the fractional

63
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,900
reserve banking system works, they can all, on an individual level, withdraw their 10,000.

64
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,540
But simultaneously, the watermelon farmer has 7,500 very real credits. If you have a

65
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,640
roommate that you agree to share your blender with, only one blender physically exists,

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,660
but two blenders' worth of value is being extracted from it, because you're both using

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,740
it just as much as you'd use your own, dedicated blender. That's essentially what's happening

68
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,620
with money, except that with money, we track the per person value, rather than the per

69
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,060
blender value. Now, it'd be easy to argue that we can't consider the bank to have

70
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,660
created 10,000 credits, and that's fair, because the system wouldn't work if it lent

71
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,780
10,000, because it couldn't give the original depositors their money back. But it does work

72
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:31,380
when they give away 7,500—a 25% reserve ratio is very typical in a fractional reserve

73
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,180
banking system—so we can at least say 7,500 was created. You could still argue that the

74
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,180
7,500 isn't actually money since it's eventually owed back to the depositors, except

75
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,460
that, if you trust and engage in the global financial system, that's not what you believe.

76
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,340
When you receive a loan, you can take out that money in cash, and when you deposit money

77
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,060
in a bank account, you can take out that money in cash—it is very real money, representing

78
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:03,020
very real value. This is exactly why answering the question of how much money exists is so

79
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,340
tough. There are at least six different commonly accepted definitions, incorporating different

80
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,140
combinations of currency, demand deposits, traveler's checks, time deposits, and more,

81
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,860
and this means of money creation is one of the primary activities that central banks

82
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,340
like the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, or Bank of Japan seek to administer and regulate.

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,940
They're in charge of telling banks how much money they have to keep in reserves, which

84
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,180
throttles how much money appears out of thin air through banks' lending process.

85
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,060
Of course, the aspect to take note of is the fact that money is created when it moves—money

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,880
is never created while it's sitting still. So, back in 1867, when moving money was tough

87
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,420
and banks were rudimentary, physical currency still pretty well correlated to the total

88
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:49,300
supply of money—most dollars were represented by a physical bill or coin—but since then,

89
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,900
well, things have changed. Abstraction helps money move. Adding paper

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,340
stand-ins for precious, rare minerals speeds up the transportation of funds and transactions.

91
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,940
Abstraction helps money grow, too, as a bank's ability to loan money provides its customers

92
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,280
the assets to then create value. Abstraction, however, doesn't alone move money from one

93
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,700
bank to the next, one town to the next, one state to the next, or one country to the next

94
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:20,660
like it does today. That required standardization. Before the Civil War, there were thousands

95
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,940
of different types of paper money backed by all sorts of private and public institutions

96
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,820
in the US. Say, for example, a watchmaker from Waltham, Massachusetts in 1857 went into

97
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,060
their bank to withdraw this $20 bill to buy some machinery down in Brookline. This isn't

98
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:41,260
the $20 bill anyone today is used to—this is a Waltham Bank $20 bill, redeemable in

99
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:46,220
gold at only the Waltham Bank but of uncertain value to anyone outside of the Waltham Bank.

100
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,980
Now, while the watchmaker's not taking on the risk or inconvenience of carrying $20

101
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,740
worth of gold, there's also no guarantee that the merchant in Brookline will take the

102
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,380
note from a bank so far out of their way. Perhaps, because of the distance, they'll

103
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,820
tack on a fee for the inconvenience of cashing the note, and say the machinery is now $23.

104
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,560
Or perhaps the watchmaker gets lucky, and they are only one of many business relations

105
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,120
the Brookline merchant keeps in the Waltham area, then maybe the merchant will accept

106
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,600
the Waltham dollars knowing they'll be able to use the bill in the future.

107
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,520
Regardless of the fate of the Waltham watchmaker, what their predicament underscores is that

108
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,360
money, when in many different forms from many different places, was hard to move, hard to

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,740
transact with, and hard to transfer outside of one's immediate community.

110
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,080
All this changed with the National Currency Acts of the 1860s. Out went thousands of separately

111
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,120
backed private bank notes, in came nationally chartered banks, and so began a new era of

112
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,000
money moving with a new means with which to do it—the modern check.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,960
Under the new rules, all nationally chartered banks had to carry about 25% of their liabilities

114
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,600
in reserve—in other words, of all the money they were good for, a quarter of that needed

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,920
to be held in gold in the basement. Crucially, though, the smaller banks, or country banks,

116
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,320
could hold these reserves in the central reserve cities, or the few big banks.

117
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,280
Effectively, the two banks were now connected—someone could now take a check from their local bank,

118
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,760
head into the city and buy supplies, and that check could then be settled at the larger

119
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,360
correspondent bank without any gold having to move outside the vault. And not only were

120
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,160
these two banks connected, countless small banks were now all linked together through

121
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
that correspondent bank functioning as a hub.

122
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
This simple connection had major consequences—it allowed a customer to move money regionally

123
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,880
without the hassle of navigating a maze of domestic exchange rates, thus stimulating

124
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,440
growth, and without the slow and risky necessity of moving actual coins or cash from bank to

125
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,880
bank, making the process quicker.

126
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,000
In this environment, armed with a Waltham check rather than Waltham dollars, a watchmaker

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,680
could pay for their supplies, the merchant could deposit their check at the Brookline

128
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,000
bank, and the Brookline bank, in turn, assuming because of their proximity they share a correspondent

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,640
bank, would send the check to the correspondent which then would balance each bank's funds

130
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,680
by moving money across the basement.

131
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,700
Now, this process at the time was far from efficient—especially when banks didn't

132
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,820
share immediate correspondent banks. When a check moved money between banks without

133
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:10,480
a direct link, they had to find a third-party bank, or in some cases multiple banks, to

134
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,740
bridge the gap and connect them with a correspondent, racking up fees, delays, and postage all along

135
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,680
the way. Take for example this check from 1898 for $43.56, which was deposited at the

136
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,600
Second National Bank of Hoboken, New Jersey, before Second National then sent it to Harvey

137
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,000
Fisk & Sons, who sent it to the Globe National Bank of Boston, who sent it to the First National

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Bank of Tonawanda, who sent it to the National Exchange Bank of Albany, who then sent it

139
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,200
to a bank in Port Jefferson, who then sent it here, who then sent it here, who then sent

140
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,320
it here, who then sent it here, who then sent it here, where it was finally drawn.

141
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,360
Still, while inefficient, these early checks were a critical stepping stone in standardizing

142
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,720
and moving an increasingly abstract form of money—bank account totals denoted in dollars,

143
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,240
not gold. The use of checks, and the ease of their accounting, took a major step forward

144
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,200
with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which split the nation into 12 separate regions,

145
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,600
and tasked each regional Federal Reserve Bank with filling the role of clearinghouse for

146
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,000
all regional checks. This centralization streamlined processing, as the bank could now credit a

147
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,080
merchant's account and know exactly which Federal Reserve Bank to send it to. It also

148
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,140
codified a critically important function that would allow money to move farther, and become

149
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,020
increasingly abstract in the decades to come—rigorous accounting.

150
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,180
In the early 1900s, checks were still rather rare, and their use remained mostly regional.

151
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,020
Then came the 50s. Now, Americans were making more money than ever, spending more money

152
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:40,820
than ever, and had more bank accounts than ever. From 1943 to 1952, national check use

153
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:45,260
doubled from $4 to $8 billion a year, and through multi-step proofing and processing,

154
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,980
American banks were wading through some 69 million checks every day.

155
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,300
Banks were drowning under the pressure. Branches closed at two in the afternoon to shift all

156
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,940
work to matching signatures, running the adding machine, double-checking the math, and packaging

157
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:03,860
the checks for shipping to the Federal Reserve. The work was grueling—most clerical staff

158
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,980
at banks quit within a year—but it was absolutely necessary. With more money passing through

159
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,460
their hands than ever before, they had to be as accurate as humanly possible.

160
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,160
Relief, though, came in the form of a computer the size of a room designed by the Stanford

161
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,820
Research Institute, funded by the Bank of America, and built by IBM. They called it

162
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,180
the Electronic Recording Machine Accounting, or IRMA, and it transformed banking. Before

163
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,020
IRMA, checks were processed at every bank branch, they came in all sizes, and they weren't

164
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,060
identified by bank account numbers. To move the process of sorting checks to the computer,

165
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,060
they'd need to be the same size, and they'd need numbers rather than names to be organized

166
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,460
by. Once those standards were adopted, checks were entered into the computer, which read

167
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:49,440
the magnetic ink, and if the account belonged to a Bank of America branch, IRMA would access

168
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,380
the account stored in its 16x20 inch magnetic drum memory, check for any account holds,

169
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,100
make sure the balance in the account was positive, draw the amount, tally the total, save the

170
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:03,300
new balance, and print the new record. Were human eyes misread, and human hands mistyped,

171
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,040
IRMA didn't, as the computer even went so far as to check the routing number by plugging

172
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,580
the digits into this algorithm to ensure the checks' legitimacy.

173
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,340
Now, the paper processing crisis that began in the 1950s was not solely a Bank of America

174
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:21,340
problem—it was structural. From monthly insurance bills to tax returns to social security

175
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,720
checks, no matter how many sorting machines were added to the system, if every transaction

176
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,140
took the form of a flimsy paper check that needed to physically pass from person to bank

177
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,620
to fed to bank, then the paper avalanche simply couldn't be contained. So, payment systems

178
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,180
went electronic, and the Automated Clearinghouse Network revolutionized the domestic movement

179
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:44,780
of money when adopted in the 1970s. Where thousands of checks once poured into reserve

180
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,740
banks and private clearinghouses every day, the ACH network now allowed for direct deposits,

181
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,080
automatic payments, and ATM transactions. Now someone looking to pay their insurance

182
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,780
premium could hand over their bank account information to the insurance company, the

183
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,420
company's bank would then create an ACH entry requesting to withdraw money, the request

184
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,140
would be processed by the ACH's operator, and the money would be debited from one account,

185
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,460
and credited to the other, no check required.

186
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,260
Of course, security and the ability to uphold accurate accounting were of paramount concern

187
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,540
in an era before the internet. Companies adopted microdeposits as a means to verify bank accounts,

188
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,620
Federal Reserve officials helped form a regulatory body called NATCHA, and in 1978 Congress passed

189
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,360
the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit customer liability and protect them against

190
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,220
wrong or fraudulent charges. The measures successfully erased consumer fears. Today,

191
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:39,340
the ACH network moves over $50 trillion across 23 billion transfers a year.

192
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:45,400
While ACH securely moves mountains of money stateside, its role ends where the US does.

193
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,100
For international transfers, there's the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial

194
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,940
Telecommunications, or SWIFT, which, like ACH, was established in the 70s to streamline payments,

195
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,880
but at the international scale. SWIFT doesn't actually move money, but instead provides

196
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,480
its 11,000 member banks a secure network and a standardized messaging format to send

197
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,880
payment orders. Prior to SWIFT, international transfers lacked standardization, security,

198
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,660
and accuracy. So, SWIFT started from scratch, organizing its member banks in a manner similar

199
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,720
to the routing numbers on a check, assigning each an 8-to-11 character code that denotes

200
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,920
bank name, country, location, and branch. The program also standardized how payments

201
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,360
were communicated. They start with a bank code, but the payment instructions are outlined

202
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,960
in an MT-103 document, which, as they're processed, can be tracked by the bank and,

203
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,280
once the transaction is complete, will function as a receipt. Now, if someone's wiring money

204
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,000
from the US, through, say, Bank of America, to Germany, through Deutsche Bank, rather

205
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,520
than actually sending money, the MT-103 will tell Deutsche Bank how many dollars to pull

206
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,820
from Bank of America's Nostra account held at Deutsche Bank, and convert them to Euros

207
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,040
to be deposited into the recipient's account. Like correspondent banks settling checks in

208
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,400
the early 1900s without taking the risk of shipping gold coins in the mail, SWIFT members

209
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,800
are able to fulfill international transactions without actually moving money across oceans.

210
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,460
Through its simplicity relative to programs before it, once a SWIFT transfer is initiated

211
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,340
and then communicated through SWIFTnet's encrypted message system, a transfer is usually

212
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,200
completed within 24 to 48 hours, with more complicated and multi-bank transactions accounting

213
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,880
for some transfers taking longer. Still, even though SWIFT functions as a member-owned cooperative

214
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,960
and therefore doesn't maximize profit, it's neither cheap nor easy to manage a

215
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,320
global network capable of securely passing along more than 40 million messages a day.

216
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,080
This cost is felt by member banks who pay to enter SWIFT, then pay SWIFT by the message—costs

217
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,760
that add up and costs that trickle down, too. Today, each international transfer, be it

218
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,120
part of everyday business or someone sending money to their family back home, usually gets

219
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,320
tagged with a fee likely starting in the $40 range.

220
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,260
Given the cost and complexity of transferring money, some have identified the opportunity

221
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,780
of layering a simpler system on top of it. Wwise, for example, is one of the world's

222
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,560
hottest fintech startups, focusing primarily on remittances. There are loads of low-to-medium

223
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,720
income people working outside of their home country who pay those huge fees to send money

224
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,600
to their families back home, but Wwise designed a system that almost entirely circumvents

225
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,440
those intermediaries. Essentially, if someone in the US is sending $1,000 to someone in

226
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:22,840
Australia, they actually transfer money into Wwise's American account, then the company

227
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,400
instructs its Australian account to send the equivalent amount, minus fees, to the recipient.

228
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,320
They're essentially a private market equivalent of SWIFT—it's a dead simple system that

229
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,400
leads to the same end result, but with far less cost and complexity.

230
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,300
Banks can't do this. You see, if Wwise messes up and sends the recipient money without debiting

231
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,200
the sender, the company is out $1,000. If a bank messes up and gives the recipient $1,000

232
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,240
without the sender being debited, $1,000 just appears out of nowhere. So that can't

233
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,120
happen. It just simply can't. If it does, money breaks, our trust breaks, the system

234
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,080
breaks. If money erroneously appears outside of the context in which we allow it to appear,

235
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,560
then it's not functioning like its physical counterpart would.

236
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,880
Money really is just a means of accounting. It's accounting for the fact that you owe

237
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,720
me an orange, but if you give me the orange and I don't give you the fruit credit, then

238
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,640
the system didn't work—the accounting failed. For the modern digital financial system

239
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,800
to function at all, the process of transfer has to be as infallible as the process of

240
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,560
handing a clay ball from one person to the next. Simulating physicality in a digital

241
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,500
network as vast and distributed as the global financial system is incredibly complex, considering

242
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,400
how complex this system itself is. These expensive, burdensome middlemen are the institutions

243
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,220
that protect that simulated physicality, so without them, money is worthless.

244
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,540
Alternatives are arising, most notably the blockchain, and central banks like the Federal

245
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,780
Reserve are studying whether to introduce blockchain-based digital currencies, but for

246
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,420
now, the world still runs on money, and money's value is all in the system's ability to

247
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,500
account for it.

248
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,540
Few things in the digital world are as finite as money, with one notable exception—domains.

249
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,540
There is only one wendoverproductions.com, for example. That scarcity means domains have

250
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,800
real value, and they especially have real value to you if you start a business, or a

251
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:27,100
YouTube channel, or something where having the corresponding domain name matters.

252
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,860
Hover can help with that. They're the domain marketplace that I've used to buy all of

253
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,260
my domains, because they have fair and transparent pricing, a super quick purchasing process,

254
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:40,200
and absolutely excellent customer support. Quite literally the moment we landed on Jetlag

255
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,320
the Game as the name for our new channel, for example, I went on Hover and bought Jetlag

256
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,460
the Game dot com, and if the dot com domain you want is already taken, Hover can still

257
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,360
help because they offer over 400 unique domain extensions, allowing you to create combinations

258
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,560
like our wendover.productions domain. And to top it all off, you can set up an email

259
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,200
using your new domain in less than a minute, allowing you to drop the at gmail or at iCloud

260
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,920
a bit for something of your own.

261
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,960
All in all, Hover is just simply the best place to buy domains online, and it's made

262
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,700
even better by the fact that clicking the button on screen or heading to hover.com slash

263
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,080
wendover will get you 10% off your first purchase, and help support the channel while you're

264
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,580
at it.
