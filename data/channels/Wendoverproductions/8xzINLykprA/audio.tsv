0	5340	Let's say I had an apple, and you had an orange, and I wanted an orange, and you wanted
5340	10680	an apple. We could trade, and both of us would end up happier than when we started.
10680	14560	But now let's say I had an apple tree, and you had an orange tree, and the apples from
14560	18800	the apple tree were ready, but the oranges wouldn't ripen for another month. I could
18800	23120	give you an apple now, and you could promise to give me an orange in a month, when they're
23120	26960	ready, and both of us would end up happier than when we started.
26960	31560	Although, maybe you didn't want an apple. Maybe you wanted a pear. But all I had to
31560	36480	give was my apple, and I still wanted your orange. Well, maybe there was a third guy,
36480	42160	a pear-laden guy, and he wanted an apple. So I give him my apple, he gives you his pear,
42160	45960	and you promise to give me your orange in a month, and we all end up happier than when
45960	46960	we started.
46960	50940	But then maybe we start to trade bigger quantities, and maybe we add more people with different
50940	54300	fruits on different harvest schedules, and maybe we decide that certain popular fruits
54300	57280	are worth more, and two of one equals one of the other, and one of the other equals
57280	61820	three of the third, and it all starts to get just a little bit complicated.
61820	66740	So, we simplify. Instead of trading physical fruit for physical fruit, we trade physical
66740	72100	fruit for fruit credits—clay balls with a generic fruit symbol carved into them. If
72100	76400	I trade an apple into the system, I get a credit, and when I want that orange, I trade
76400	79660	the credit in—nobody has to keep track of what I'm owed.
79660	83980	Now that we have this system going, we might as well add vegetables into the mix. Sure,
84660	88420	it's not fruit, but we want veggie sometimes, and the veggie farmers want fruit too, so
88420	90540	the system still works.
90540	95060	Naturally, as the system develops and develops with more and more items and more and more
95060	99400	complexity, we start to feel that these fruit credits have value, even though they merely
99400	104560	represent theoretical value. But that theoretical value can be turned into real value, and so
104560	109080	in a way, the clay balls—the representation of theoretical value that translates into
109080	112780	real value—hold real value in and of themselves.
113100	116860	So, someone starts a business where they'll keep your fruit credits safe for you, free
116860	122540	of charge. Better yet, they'll pay you to keep your credits safe. It sounds like a scam,
122540	126700	and maybe it is, but you take the risk and deposit a thousand credits.
126700	131460	Elsewhere, in order to grow more watermelons this year, and therefore earn more fruit credits,
131460	135780	a watermelon farmer needs more credits than she has to exchange for an irrigation system.
135780	140460	So, this new credit storage business offers to give her 7,500 credits if she promises
140460	144800	to give 9,000 back in a year. This seems like a safe bet since she's already a successful
144800	148060	watermelon farmer, and it's worth it for her since she'll get the new irrigation
148060	151500	system, and worth it to this new fruit credit safeguarding business since they'll get
151500	155180	more credits, and everyone ends up happier than when they started.
155180	160060	Meanwhile, you're told that you can take your credits out at any time, and you can,
160060	164540	even if they only kept 250 of them on hand. That's because there are nine more farmers
164540	168380	that deposited their thousand credits too, and even if the safeguarding business only
168380	172460	kept a quarter of them, a quarter of all deposits is much more than your thousand,
172460	177020	and the chances of everyone wanting their credits at the same time is negligibly low.
177020	182880	So, this is a free money machine. You make money, the bank makes money, and the watermelon
182880	191380	farmer makes money. Everyone makes money. But wait, everyone makes money? You, the bank,
191380	195460	and the watermelon farmer end up with more money than when you started, so where did
195460	197060	it come from?
197060	201100	If we turn this into a closed loop, where no money enters or exits the system, we can
201100	206300	track down the source. So, ten people with 10,000 credits each deposit a thousand, meaning
206300	211620	the bank now has 10,000. The bank lends those 7,500 out to the watermelon farmer, meaning
211620	216980	it now holds 2,500. She pays that 7,500 to one of the ten depositors for an irrigation
216980	221360	system they're selling. One growing season later, the farmer has 9,000 watermelons that
221360	225180	she brings to the market, and sells 900 of them to each of the same group of ten that
225180	230220	put their money into the bank. They now each have 9,100 credits, a thousand of which sit
230220	234700	in the bank. Meanwhile, the farmer has 9,000 what she gives to the bank, meaning it now
234700	241500	holds 11,500 credits. So, the farmer has nothing, the ten individuals have 98,500 total, and
241500	249420	the bank has 11,500, meaning there are now 110,000 credits in the system. Once again,
249420	251820	money has appeared out of thin air.
252460	257940	So, its source. In the very first step, 10,000 credit deposits go into the bank, but the
257940	264100	ten individuals still each have $10,000. It's just that 1,000 of it's in the bank. That's
264100	267820	not the bank's money, so the 10,000 sitting in their vault isn't theirs, which means
267820	275140	the money is created exactly… now. The moment that loan goes out, new money has appeared.
275140	279700	The original depositors still have their 100,000 credits, because with the way the fractional
279700	285900	reserve banking system works, they can all, on an individual level, withdraw their 10,000.
285900	292540	But simultaneously, the watermelon farmer has 7,500 very real credits. If you have a
292540	297640	roommate that you agree to share your blender with, only one blender physically exists,
297640	301660	but two blenders' worth of value is being extracted from it, because you're both using
301660	306740	it just as much as you'd use your own, dedicated blender. That's essentially what's happening
306740	311620	with money, except that with money, we track the per person value, rather than the per
311620	316060	blender value. Now, it'd be easy to argue that we can't consider the bank to have
316060	320660	created 10,000 credits, and that's fair, because the system wouldn't work if it lent
320660	325780	10,000, because it couldn't give the original depositors their money back. But it does work
325780	331380	when they give away 7,500—a 25% reserve ratio is very typical in a fractional reserve
331380	337180	banking system—so we can at least say 7,500 was created. You could still argue that the
337180	342180	7,500 isn't actually money since it's eventually owed back to the depositors, except
342180	348460	that, if you trust and engage in the global financial system, that's not what you believe.
348460	352340	When you receive a loan, you can take out that money in cash, and when you deposit money
352340	357060	in a bank account, you can take out that money in cash—it is very real money, representing
357060	363020	very real value. This is exactly why answering the question of how much money exists is so
363020	367340	tough. There are at least six different commonly accepted definitions, incorporating different
367340	372140	combinations of currency, demand deposits, traveler's checks, time deposits, and more,
372140	375860	and this means of money creation is one of the primary activities that central banks
375860	380340	like the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, or Bank of Japan seek to administer and regulate.
380340	383940	They're in charge of telling banks how much money they have to keep in reserves, which
383940	388180	throttles how much money appears out of thin air through banks' lending process.
388180	393060	Of course, the aspect to take note of is the fact that money is created when it moves—money
393060	398880	is never created while it's sitting still. So, back in 1867, when moving money was tough
398880	403420	and banks were rudimentary, physical currency still pretty well correlated to the total
403420	409300	supply of money—most dollars were represented by a physical bill or coin—but since then,
409300	414900	well, things have changed. Abstraction helps money move. Adding paper
414900	420340	stand-ins for precious, rare minerals speeds up the transportation of funds and transactions.
420340	424940	Abstraction helps money grow, too, as a bank's ability to loan money provides its customers
424940	430280	the assets to then create value. Abstraction, however, doesn't alone move money from one
430280	434700	bank to the next, one town to the next, one state to the next, or one country to the next
434700	440660	like it does today. That required standardization. Before the Civil War, there were thousands
440660	444940	of different types of paper money backed by all sorts of private and public institutions
444940	450820	in the US. Say, for example, a watchmaker from Waltham, Massachusetts in 1857 went into
450820	456060	their bank to withdraw this $20 bill to buy some machinery down in Brookline. This isn't
456060	461260	the $20 bill anyone today is used to—this is a Waltham Bank $20 bill, redeemable in
461260	466220	gold at only the Waltham Bank but of uncertain value to anyone outside of the Waltham Bank.
466220	470980	Now, while the watchmaker's not taking on the risk or inconvenience of carrying $20
470980	474740	worth of gold, there's also no guarantee that the merchant in Brookline will take the
474740	479380	note from a bank so far out of their way. Perhaps, because of the distance, they'll
479380	484820	tack on a fee for the inconvenience of cashing the note, and say the machinery is now $23.
484820	488560	Or perhaps the watchmaker gets lucky, and they are only one of many business relations
488560	492120	the Brookline merchant keeps in the Waltham area, then maybe the merchant will accept
492120	495600	the Waltham dollars knowing they'll be able to use the bill in the future.
495600	499520	Regardless of the fate of the Waltham watchmaker, what their predicament underscores is that
499520	504360	money, when in many different forms from many different places, was hard to move, hard to
504360	508740	transact with, and hard to transfer outside of one's immediate community.
508740	514080	All this changed with the National Currency Acts of the 1860s. Out went thousands of separately
514080	519120	backed private bank notes, in came nationally chartered banks, and so began a new era of
519120	524000	money moving with a new means with which to do it—the modern check.
524000	528960	Under the new rules, all nationally chartered banks had to carry about 25% of their liabilities
528960	533600	in reserve—in other words, of all the money they were good for, a quarter of that needed
533600	538920	to be held in gold in the basement. Crucially, though, the smaller banks, or country banks,
538920	543320	could hold these reserves in the central reserve cities, or the few big banks.
543320	548280	Effectively, the two banks were now connected—someone could now take a check from their local bank,
548280	551760	head into the city and buy supplies, and that check could then be settled at the larger
551760	556360	correspondent bank without any gold having to move outside the vault. And not only were
556360	560160	these two banks connected, countless small banks were now all linked together through
560160	563120	that correspondent bank functioning as a hub.
563120	567600	This simple connection had major consequences—it allowed a customer to move money regionally
567600	571880	without the hassle of navigating a maze of domestic exchange rates, thus stimulating
571880	576440	growth, and without the slow and risky necessity of moving actual coins or cash from bank to
576440	578880	bank, making the process quicker.
578880	583000	In this environment, armed with a Waltham check rather than Waltham dollars, a watchmaker
583000	586680	could pay for their supplies, the merchant could deposit their check at the Brookline
586680	591000	bank, and the Brookline bank, in turn, assuming because of their proximity they share a correspondent
591000	594640	bank, would send the check to the correspondent which then would balance each bank's funds
594640	596680	by moving money across the basement.
596680	601700	Now, this process at the time was far from efficient—especially when banks didn't
601700	605820	share immediate correspondent banks. When a check moved money between banks without
605820	610480	a direct link, they had to find a third-party bank, or in some cases multiple banks, to
610480	615740	bridge the gap and connect them with a correspondent, racking up fees, delays, and postage all along
615740	621680	the way. Take for example this check from 1898 for $43.56, which was deposited at the
621680	625600	Second National Bank of Hoboken, New Jersey, before Second National then sent it to Harvey
625600	630000	Fisk & Sons, who sent it to the Globe National Bank of Boston, who sent it to the First National
630000	634000	Bank of Tonawanda, who sent it to the National Exchange Bank of Albany, who then sent it
634000	638200	to a bank in Port Jefferson, who then sent it here, who then sent it here, who then sent
638200	643320	it here, who then sent it here, who then sent it here, where it was finally drawn.
643320	648360	Still, while inefficient, these early checks were a critical stepping stone in standardizing
648360	653720	and moving an increasingly abstract form of money—bank account totals denoted in dollars,
653720	658240	not gold. The use of checks, and the ease of their accounting, took a major step forward
658240	663200	with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, which split the nation into 12 separate regions,
663200	666600	and tasked each regional Federal Reserve Bank with filling the role of clearinghouse for
666600	672000	all regional checks. This centralization streamlined processing, as the bank could now credit a
672000	676080	merchant's account and know exactly which Federal Reserve Bank to send it to. It also
676080	680140	codified a critically important function that would allow money to move farther, and become
680140	685020	increasingly abstract in the decades to come—rigorous accounting.
685020	690180	In the early 1900s, checks were still rather rare, and their use remained mostly regional.
690180	695020	Then came the 50s. Now, Americans were making more money than ever, spending more money
695020	700820	than ever, and had more bank accounts than ever. From 1943 to 1952, national check use
700820	705260	doubled from $4 to $8 billion a year, and through multi-step proofing and processing,
705260	709980	American banks were wading through some 69 million checks every day.
709980	714300	Banks were drowning under the pressure. Branches closed at two in the afternoon to shift all
714300	718940	work to matching signatures, running the adding machine, double-checking the math, and packaging
718940	723860	the checks for shipping to the Federal Reserve. The work was grueling—most clerical staff
723860	728980	at banks quit within a year—but it was absolutely necessary. With more money passing through
728980	733460	their hands than ever before, they had to be as accurate as humanly possible.
734460	738160	Relief, though, came in the form of a computer the size of a room designed by the Stanford
738160	742820	Research Institute, funded by the Bank of America, and built by IBM. They called it
742820	748180	the Electronic Recording Machine Accounting, or IRMA, and it transformed banking. Before
748180	753020	IRMA, checks were processed at every bank branch, they came in all sizes, and they weren't
753020	757060	identified by bank account numbers. To move the process of sorting checks to the computer,
757060	761060	they'd need to be the same size, and they'd need numbers rather than names to be organized
761060	765460	by. Once those standards were adopted, checks were entered into the computer, which read
765460	769440	the magnetic ink, and if the account belonged to a Bank of America branch, IRMA would access
769440	774380	the account stored in its 16x20 inch magnetic drum memory, check for any account holds,
774380	778100	make sure the balance in the account was positive, draw the amount, tally the total, save the
778100	783300	new balance, and print the new record. Were human eyes misread, and human hands mistyped,
783300	787040	IRMA didn't, as the computer even went so far as to check the routing number by plugging
787040	790580	the digits into this algorithm to ensure the checks' legitimacy.
791100	796340	Now, the paper processing crisis that began in the 1950s was not solely a Bank of America
796340	801340	problem—it was structural. From monthly insurance bills to tax returns to social security
801340	805720	checks, no matter how many sorting machines were added to the system, if every transaction
805720	810140	took the form of a flimsy paper check that needed to physically pass from person to bank
810140	815620	to fed to bank, then the paper avalanche simply couldn't be contained. So, payment systems
815620	820180	went electronic, and the Automated Clearinghouse Network revolutionized the domestic movement
820180	824780	of money when adopted in the 1970s. Where thousands of checks once poured into reserve
824780	829740	banks and private clearinghouses every day, the ACH network now allowed for direct deposits,
829740	834080	automatic payments, and ATM transactions. Now someone looking to pay their insurance
834080	837780	premium could hand over their bank account information to the insurance company, the
837780	841420	company's bank would then create an ACH entry requesting to withdraw money, the request
841420	845140	would be processed by the ACH's operator, and the money would be debited from one account,
845140	848460	and credited to the other, no check required.
848460	853260	Of course, security and the ability to uphold accurate accounting were of paramount concern
853260	858540	in an era before the internet. Companies adopted microdeposits as a means to verify bank accounts,
858540	863620	Federal Reserve officials helped form a regulatory body called NATCHA, and in 1978 Congress passed
863620	867360	the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to limit customer liability and protect them against
867360	873220	wrong or fraudulent charges. The measures successfully erased consumer fears. Today,
873220	879340	the ACH network moves over $50 trillion across 23 billion transfers a year.
879340	885400	While ACH securely moves mountains of money stateside, its role ends where the US does.
885400	889100	For international transfers, there's the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
889100	894940	Telecommunications, or SWIFT, which, like ACH, was established in the 70s to streamline payments,
894940	899880	but at the international scale. SWIFT doesn't actually move money, but instead provides
899880	904480	its 11,000 member banks a secure network and a standardized messaging format to send
904480	909880	payment orders. Prior to SWIFT, international transfers lacked standardization, security,
909880	914660	and accuracy. So, SWIFT started from scratch, organizing its member banks in a manner similar
914660	918720	to the routing numbers on a check, assigning each an 8-to-11 character code that denotes
918720	923920	bank name, country, location, and branch. The program also standardized how payments
923920	927360	were communicated. They start with a bank code, but the payment instructions are outlined
927360	931960	in an MT-103 document, which, as they're processed, can be tracked by the bank and,
931960	936280	once the transaction is complete, will function as a receipt. Now, if someone's wiring money
936280	941000	from the US, through, say, Bank of America, to Germany, through Deutsche Bank, rather
941000	945520	than actually sending money, the MT-103 will tell Deutsche Bank how many dollars to pull
945520	949820	from Bank of America's Nostra account held at Deutsche Bank, and convert them to Euros
949820	954040	to be deposited into the recipient's account. Like correspondent banks settling checks in
954040	958400	the early 1900s without taking the risk of shipping gold coins in the mail, SWIFT members
958400	963800	are able to fulfill international transactions without actually moving money across oceans.
963800	967460	Through its simplicity relative to programs before it, once a SWIFT transfer is initiated
967460	971340	and then communicated through SWIFTnet's encrypted message system, a transfer is usually
971340	976200	completed within 24 to 48 hours, with more complicated and multi-bank transactions accounting
976200	981880	for some transfers taking longer. Still, even though SWIFT functions as a member-owned cooperative
981880	985960	and therefore doesn't maximize profit, it's neither cheap nor easy to manage a
985960	991320	global network capable of securely passing along more than 40 million messages a day.
991320	996080	This cost is felt by member banks who pay to enter SWIFT, then pay SWIFT by the message—costs
996080	1001760	that add up and costs that trickle down, too. Today, each international transfer, be it
1001760	1006120	part of everyday business or someone sending money to their family back home, usually gets
1006120	1010320	tagged with a fee likely starting in the $40 range.
1010320	1014260	Given the cost and complexity of transferring money, some have identified the opportunity
1014260	1019780	of layering a simpler system on top of it. Wwise, for example, is one of the world's
1019780	1024560	hottest fintech startups, focusing primarily on remittances. There are loads of low-to-medium
1024560	1028720	income people working outside of their home country who pay those huge fees to send money
1028720	1033600	to their families back home, but Wwise designed a system that almost entirely circumvents
1033600	1038440	those intermediaries. Essentially, if someone in the US is sending $1,000 to someone in
1038440	1042840	Australia, they actually transfer money into Wwise's American account, then the company
1042840	1047400	instructs its Australian account to send the equivalent amount, minus fees, to the recipient.
1047400	1052320	They're essentially a private market equivalent of SWIFT—it's a dead simple system that
1052320	1057400	leads to the same end result, but with far less cost and complexity.
1057400	1062300	Banks can't do this. You see, if Wwise messes up and sends the recipient money without debiting
1062300	1068200	the sender, the company is out $1,000. If a bank messes up and gives the recipient $1,000
1068200	1074240	without the sender being debited, $1,000 just appears out of nowhere. So that can't
1074240	1081120	happen. It just simply can't. If it does, money breaks, our trust breaks, the system
1081120	1087080	breaks. If money erroneously appears outside of the context in which we allow it to appear,
1087080	1090560	then it's not functioning like its physical counterpart would.
1090560	1094880	Money really is just a means of accounting. It's accounting for the fact that you owe
1094880	1098720	me an orange, but if you give me the orange and I don't give you the fruit credit, then
1098720	1103640	the system didn't work—the accounting failed. For the modern digital financial system
1103640	1108800	to function at all, the process of transfer has to be as infallible as the process of
1108800	1113560	handing a clay ball from one person to the next. Simulating physicality in a digital
1113560	1119500	network as vast and distributed as the global financial system is incredibly complex, considering
1119500	1125400	how complex this system itself is. These expensive, burdensome middlemen are the institutions
1125400	1131220	that protect that simulated physicality, so without them, money is worthless.
1131220	1135540	Alternatives are arising, most notably the blockchain, and central banks like the Federal
1135540	1139780	Reserve are studying whether to introduce blockchain-based digital currencies, but for
1139780	1145420	now, the world still runs on money, and money's value is all in the system's ability to
1145420	1147500	account for it.
1147500	1153540	Few things in the digital world are as finite as money, with one notable exception—domains.
1153540	1158540	There is only one wendoverproductions.com, for example. That scarcity means domains have
1158540	1162800	real value, and they especially have real value to you if you start a business, or a
1162800	1167100	YouTube channel, or something where having the corresponding domain name matters.
1167100	1170860	Hover can help with that. They're the domain marketplace that I've used to buy all of
1170860	1175260	my domains, because they have fair and transparent pricing, a super quick purchasing process,
1175260	1180200	and absolutely excellent customer support. Quite literally the moment we landed on Jetlag
1180200	1184320	the Game as the name for our new channel, for example, I went on Hover and bought Jetlag
1184320	1188460	the Game dot com, and if the dot com domain you want is already taken, Hover can still
1188460	1193360	help because they offer over 400 unique domain extensions, allowing you to create combinations
1193360	1197560	like our wendover.productions domain. And to top it all off, you can set up an email
1197560	1202200	using your new domain in less than a minute, allowing you to drop the at gmail or at iCloud
1202200	1203920	a bit for something of your own.
1203920	1207960	All in all, Hover is just simply the best place to buy domains online, and it's made
1207960	1211700	even better by the fact that clicking the button on screen or heading to hover.com slash
1211700	1216080	wendover will get you 10% off your first purchase, and help support the channel while you're
1216080	1216580	at it.
