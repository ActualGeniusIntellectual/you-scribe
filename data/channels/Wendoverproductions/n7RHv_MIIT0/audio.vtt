00:00.000 --> 00:05.060
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list called Wikipedia colon unusual articles.

00:05.060 --> 00:09.500
It's filled with unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable subjects.

00:09.500 --> 00:13.460
Every other week, I click on a new link and teach you a little bit more about our amazing

00:13.460 --> 00:14.460
world.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.780
Do you want to live forever?

00:16.780 --> 00:20.900
Well, if Wolverine or Deadpool taught you anything, you don't, but there's a theory

00:20.900 --> 00:21.900
on how you can.

00:21.900 --> 00:25.620
It's going to need a bit of explanation, so if you're like this guy and don't enjoy

00:25.620 --> 00:29.500
long-winded answers, I suggest you turn off the video now.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.500
Quantum mechanics.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.500
They're complicated.

00:31.500 --> 00:35.620
What we're going to talk about today is only a theory because it's practically impossible

00:35.620 --> 00:36.620
to test.

00:36.620 --> 00:40.500
One of the bases of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

00:40.500 --> 00:45.280
Heisenberg says that, in quantum mechanics, the more precisely the position is determined,

00:45.280 --> 00:49.460
the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant and vice versa.

00:49.460 --> 00:50.460
Let me explain.

00:50.460 --> 00:51.940
Imagine you're a blind man.

00:51.940 --> 00:55.660
In order to tell how far away an object is, you've developed a system in which you throw

00:55.660 --> 00:59.120
a tennis ball at an object—let's say a larger medicine ball.

00:59.120 --> 01:02.260
If your tennis ball bounces back in a short amount of time, you know that the medicine

01:02.260 --> 01:03.520
ball is close.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.160
If it bounces back in a longer amount of time, the medicine ball is farther.

01:07.160 --> 01:11.260
The problem is, however, that through observing where the medicine ball is, you've moved

01:11.260 --> 01:15.240
it and it's therefore no longer in the position in which you observed it.

01:15.240 --> 01:19.680
In the subatomic world, it's essentially impossible to observe an object without affecting

01:19.680 --> 01:23.960
it, so all quantum theories must be based on and proven by thought experiments.

01:23.960 --> 01:28.680
Alright, that was my best attempt at summarizing a concept that you can study for years in

01:28.680 --> 01:30.240
30 seconds.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.680
If you want to learn more, you can click here for a Veritasium video on the subject.

01:34.680 --> 01:38.240
The first theory in our long-winded explanation is the many-worlds theory.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.000
Let's say you're standing on top of a cliff—you're making the decision on whether

01:42.000 --> 01:43.480
or not to jump.

01:43.480 --> 01:47.520
According to the many-worlds theory, the very moment that your decision is made, the universe

01:47.520 --> 01:51.680
splits into two—one copy being the timeline in which you jump off the cliff, the other

01:51.680 --> 01:53.480
being the one where you walk away.

01:53.480 --> 01:56.800
Of course, the you that jumped off the cliff doesn't know that the universe split into

01:56.800 --> 02:02.280
two and in your reality, life just continues on as normal while simultaneously in a different

02:02.280 --> 02:06.280
universe, a copy of you continues his life following his decision not to jump from the

02:06.280 --> 02:07.280
cliff.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.560
The many-worlds theory says that every single time a decision is made by anyone or anything,

02:12.560 --> 02:18.320
the universe splits and yourself inhabits only one of nearly infinite different universes.

02:18.320 --> 02:19.880
Now to quantum suicide.

02:19.880 --> 02:24.680
In this thought experiment, you, the experimenter, are standing in a box with a nuclear bomb

02:24.680 --> 02:29.160
that, if exploded, will immediately and unconditionally kill you.

02:29.160 --> 02:34.680
Hooked up to the bomb is a trigger that measures the spin value of a proton every three seconds.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.660
If the proton spins one way, there's just a click sound.

02:37.660 --> 02:39.840
The other way, the bomb explodes.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.480
Statistically, the proton should have a 50% chance of spinning one way or another so the

02:44.480 --> 02:56.080
chance of the bomb going off or not is truly random.

02:56.080 --> 03:01.200
At this point, there's only a 12.5% chance that the bomb not going off was random.

03:01.200 --> 03:08.240
We'll keep going.

03:08.240 --> 03:13.340
If we fast forward 300 seconds after the proton has been measured 100 times, there's only

03:13.340 --> 03:18.140
an 800 octillionth of a percent chance that your survival is random.

03:18.140 --> 03:22.540
We can now conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that you are immortal.

03:22.540 --> 03:26.740
What happened is that every time the proton was measured, every time the bomb could have

03:26.740 --> 03:31.620
gone off, the universe split into two, one being the scenario in which you die, the other

03:31.620 --> 03:33.640
being the one in which you live.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.340
But why didn't you go to the universe where the bomb went off?

03:36.340 --> 03:37.940
Why didn't you go to the one where you died?

03:37.940 --> 03:39.660
Well, it's quite simple.

03:39.660 --> 03:43.000
The version of you who died cannot know that he died.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.160
Only the version of you who lived can know that you lived.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.480
The next time the bomb went off, the same situation occurred.

03:49.480 --> 03:52.780
Only the living version of you continues on in consciousness.

03:52.780 --> 03:57.400
On and on this will continue, forever, because the version of you who lives can continue

03:57.400 --> 03:59.060
to realize he's living.

03:59.060 --> 04:03.440
You can't die because only your living self will keep consciousness and existence.

04:03.440 --> 04:07.420
This, of course, brings up a lot of existential questions.

04:07.420 --> 04:10.160
Will the version of yourself who lives be the same person?

04:10.160 --> 04:12.920
Are the people around you in the new universe the same people?

04:12.920 --> 04:16.920
Shouldn't everyone be immortal from any sort of death in some universe?

04:16.920 --> 04:20.520
What does it mean to be a person if there are so many versions of you?

04:20.520 --> 04:24.880
There are certainly flaws to this theory and there are certainly unanswerable questions.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.920
So should you go off and try quantum suicide in order to prove your own immortality?

04:28.920 --> 04:31.220
Well, I'd suggest not.

04:31.220 --> 04:35.040
This whole theory is based on the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics which

04:35.040 --> 04:38.180
is only the second or third most popular interpretation.

04:38.180 --> 04:42.160
The Copenhagen theory, which you know from Schrodinger's cat, is the leading interpretation

04:42.160 --> 04:47.020
of quantum mechanics and would lead to you being properly and unconditionally dead.
