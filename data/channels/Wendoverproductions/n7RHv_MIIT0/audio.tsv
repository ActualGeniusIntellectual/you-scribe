0	5060	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list called Wikipedia colon unusual articles.
5060	9500	It's filled with unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable subjects.
9500	13460	Every other week, I click on a new link and teach you a little bit more about our amazing
13460	14460	world.
14460	16780	Do you want to live forever?
16780	20900	Well, if Wolverine or Deadpool taught you anything, you don't, but there's a theory
20900	21900	on how you can.
21900	25620	It's going to need a bit of explanation, so if you're like this guy and don't enjoy
25620	29500	long-winded answers, I suggest you turn off the video now.
29500	30500	Quantum mechanics.
30500	31500	They're complicated.
31500	35620	What we're going to talk about today is only a theory because it's practically impossible
35620	36620	to test.
36620	40500	One of the bases of quantum mechanics is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
40500	45280	Heisenberg says that, in quantum mechanics, the more precisely the position is determined,
45280	49460	the less precisely the momentum is known in this instant and vice versa.
49460	50460	Let me explain.
50460	51940	Imagine you're a blind man.
51940	55660	In order to tell how far away an object is, you've developed a system in which you throw
55660	59120	a tennis ball at an object—let's say a larger medicine ball.
59120	62260	If your tennis ball bounces back in a short amount of time, you know that the medicine
62260	63520	ball is close.
63520	67160	If it bounces back in a longer amount of time, the medicine ball is farther.
67160	71260	The problem is, however, that through observing where the medicine ball is, you've moved
71260	75240	it and it's therefore no longer in the position in which you observed it.
75240	79680	In the subatomic world, it's essentially impossible to observe an object without affecting
79680	83960	it, so all quantum theories must be based on and proven by thought experiments.
83960	88680	Alright, that was my best attempt at summarizing a concept that you can study for years in
88680	90240	30 seconds.
90240	94680	If you want to learn more, you can click here for a Veritasium video on the subject.
94680	98240	The first theory in our long-winded explanation is the many-worlds theory.
98240	102000	Let's say you're standing on top of a cliff—you're making the decision on whether
102000	103480	or not to jump.
103480	107520	According to the many-worlds theory, the very moment that your decision is made, the universe
107520	111680	splits into two—one copy being the timeline in which you jump off the cliff, the other
111680	113480	being the one where you walk away.
113480	116800	Of course, the you that jumped off the cliff doesn't know that the universe split into
116800	122280	two and in your reality, life just continues on as normal while simultaneously in a different
122280	126280	universe, a copy of you continues his life following his decision not to jump from the
126280	127280	cliff.
127280	132560	The many-worlds theory says that every single time a decision is made by anyone or anything,
132560	138320	the universe splits and yourself inhabits only one of nearly infinite different universes.
138320	139880	Now to quantum suicide.
139880	144680	In this thought experiment, you, the experimenter, are standing in a box with a nuclear bomb
144680	149160	that, if exploded, will immediately and unconditionally kill you.
149160	154680	Hooked up to the bomb is a trigger that measures the spin value of a proton every three seconds.
154680	157660	If the proton spins one way, there's just a click sound.
157660	159840	The other way, the bomb explodes.
159840	164480	Statistically, the proton should have a 50% chance of spinning one way or another so the
164480	176080	chance of the bomb going off or not is truly random.
176080	181200	At this point, there's only a 12.5% chance that the bomb not going off was random.
181200	188240	We'll keep going.
188240	193340	If we fast forward 300 seconds after the proton has been measured 100 times, there's only
193340	198140	an 800 octillionth of a percent chance that your survival is random.
198140	202540	We can now conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that you are immortal.
202540	206740	What happened is that every time the proton was measured, every time the bomb could have
206740	211620	gone off, the universe split into two, one being the scenario in which you die, the other
211620	213640	being the one in which you live.
213640	216340	But why didn't you go to the universe where the bomb went off?
216340	217940	Why didn't you go to the one where you died?
217940	219660	Well, it's quite simple.
219660	223000	The version of you who died cannot know that he died.
223000	226160	Only the version of you who lived can know that you lived.
226160	229480	The next time the bomb went off, the same situation occurred.
229480	232780	Only the living version of you continues on in consciousness.
232780	237400	On and on this will continue, forever, because the version of you who lives can continue
237400	239060	to realize he's living.
239060	243440	You can't die because only your living self will keep consciousness and existence.
243440	247420	This, of course, brings up a lot of existential questions.
247420	250160	Will the version of yourself who lives be the same person?
250160	252920	Are the people around you in the new universe the same people?
252920	256920	Shouldn't everyone be immortal from any sort of death in some universe?
256920	260520	What does it mean to be a person if there are so many versions of you?
260520	264880	There are certainly flaws to this theory and there are certainly unanswerable questions.
264880	268920	So should you go off and try quantum suicide in order to prove your own immortality?
268920	271220	Well, I'd suggest not.
271220	275040	This whole theory is based on the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics which
275040	278180	is only the second or third most popular interpretation.
278180	282160	The Copenhagen theory, which you know from Schrodinger's cat, is the leading interpretation
282160	287020	of quantum mechanics and would lead to you being properly and unconditionally dead.
