00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
The end might not be near.

00:03.720 --> 00:06.880
Doom might not be inevitable.

00:06.880 --> 00:09.480
But not according to the news.

00:09.480 --> 00:14.480
After a weekend of dramatic White House emergency actions, US President-

00:14.480 --> 00:20.240
Biden has given the go-ahead for a controversial oil drilling scheme, environmentalists say

00:20.240 --> 00:21.820
it's a carbon bomb.

00:21.820 --> 00:27.380
And despite a wet winter in the West, persistent drought and overdevelopment cause record low

00:27.380 --> 00:48.100
water levels for tens of millions of Americans.

00:48.100 --> 00:49.380
Imagine a forest.

00:49.380 --> 00:50.740
Imagine it's your home.

00:50.740 --> 00:53.920
It's both your shelter and your source of sustenance.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.940
It offers rocks to make axes, timber to build shelters, but most importantly, berries and

00:58.940 --> 01:04.760
nuts and ducks and all sorts of food, but to get to it, you have to go out.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.760
Out is scary.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.760
Out is where the threats are.

01:08.760 --> 01:10.400
You're on a path.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.900
Your sightlines are limited.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.480
This forces you to walk.

01:13.480 --> 01:14.580
To search.

01:14.580 --> 01:19.580
As a necessity for survival, to find the food that will feed you, your mate, or your child

01:19.580 --> 01:24.300
that will ensure a slightly altered copy of your DNA gets copied once again, to keep

01:24.300 --> 01:28.180
the species alive, you need to tread into the unknown.

01:28.180 --> 01:35.900
So you walk, and you search, and you walk, and you search, and you walk, and you search,

01:35.900 --> 01:38.860
and you walk, and you- bear, there's a bear!

01:38.860 --> 01:42.420
Epinephrine, cortisol, your heart rate spikes, breathing quickens, blood vessels contract,

01:42.420 --> 01:46.100
digestion stops, your vision focuses, your pupils dilate, your hearing drops out, your

01:46.100 --> 01:51.260
muscles tense, and within an instant, your body has reworked itself—reprioritize resources,

01:51.260 --> 01:55.380
switching from a physiological state suited to exploring to one that can best assess,

01:55.380 --> 01:57.740
address, or evade a threat.

01:57.740 --> 02:01.900
This split-second moment of identifying a threat has occurred immeasurable times through

02:01.900 --> 02:06.260
human history, ending in immeasurable different outcomes, but each of these outcomes can be

02:06.260 --> 02:11.800
categorized into one of two categories—survival or death.

02:11.800 --> 02:16.200
Various factors altered each—a slippery rock slowed to retreat, a convenient cave

02:16.200 --> 02:20.840
offered refuge, a blunt spear inhibited a defense—but when summing up the total of

02:20.840 --> 02:24.440
those immeasurable instances, there was a pattern.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.480
The degree of that physiological response correlated to the likelihood of survival.

02:29.480 --> 02:35.540
How well muscles tense, how much vision focused, how quickly cortisol released—all this mattered

02:35.540 --> 02:40.760
to whether or not a human survived an encounter with a threat, so, through the totality of

02:40.760 --> 02:45.800
humanity, the DNA that created humans with a stronger response to the negative was more

02:45.800 --> 02:48.360
likely to get recreated through offspring.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.600
That's evolution.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.800
But that's also a theory.

02:51.800 --> 02:56.200
What we do know with certainty is that today's humans respond more strongly to a negative

02:56.200 --> 03:01.840
stimulus than a positive one, even when those two stimuli are objectively equal in weight.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.960
Think back to high school—what do you remember?

03:03.960 --> 03:08.160
The great jokes you told, or all the awkward encounters?

03:08.160 --> 03:12.520
This disproportionate response is something that we can and have proved time and time

03:12.520 --> 03:16.920
again in academic research, so we call it the negativity bias.

03:16.920 --> 03:21.320
But what we can't directly prove is whether or not this is something natural—something

03:21.320 --> 03:25.320
rooted in our DNA, crafted by evolution, or if it's cultural.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.320
Maybe society overemphasizes negative moments.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.320
Maybe the awkward encounters from middle school really did have more of an impact on others'

03:32.320 --> 03:36.800
perception of us than the great jokes, and so we've learned to react to them appropriately.

03:36.840 --> 03:42.440
But evolution leaves its fingerprints, and natural experiments can search for them.

03:42.440 --> 03:46.000
Certain humans are male, certain others are female, and the most critical component of

03:46.000 --> 03:48.500
evolution is reproduction.

03:48.500 --> 03:53.100
During human pregnancy, the evolutionary influence of parental death differs depending on whether

03:53.100 --> 03:55.600
it occurs to a father or mother.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.760
If a father dies, the likelihood of reproductive success does go down.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.840
There's then only one individual in a diminished physical state to find food and fight off

04:04.840 --> 04:07.400
threats, but there's still a chance.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.640
If the mother dies, however, that's it.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.300
Reproduction fails.

04:12.300 --> 04:13.300
Evolution stops.

04:13.300 --> 04:19.120
But simultaneously, in an era when pregnancy was far more perilous than today, reproductive

04:19.120 --> 04:22.160
success went up when food was more plentiful.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.720
Therefore, the chance of a father's DNA getting passed on increased as they found

04:26.720 --> 04:31.360
more food, but to do so, they couldn't be too worried about the negative—the threats.

04:31.400 --> 04:35.720
They needed to be motivated to take the level of risk that optimizes for finding the most

04:35.720 --> 04:39.680
food possible, even if it increases their chances of death.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.920
Meanwhile, the mother, with far higher and more direct evolutionary pressure to survive,

04:44.920 --> 04:48.740
must first and foremost focus on her and her child's survival.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.160
Her fight or flight response needs to be huge so she's able to best respond to any threat

04:53.160 --> 04:54.880
that she might encounter.

04:54.880 --> 04:58.280
When studied, the facts support this theory.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.540
Female humans exhibit a weaker negativity bias than female ones.

05:02.540 --> 05:07.080
They still have the bias—they still respond disproportionately to the negative—but not

05:07.080 --> 05:08.480
quite as strongly.

05:08.480 --> 05:12.840
It seems like evolution worked, crafting a structure that appropriately optimized for

05:12.840 --> 05:15.720
the greatest likelihood of successful reproduction.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.780
So, the case is made.

05:17.780 --> 05:22.200
As best we can tell, the negativity bias was not learned—it was evolved.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.720
It's natural.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.920
The positive just doesn't elicit the same emotional response in humans, and there's

05:27.920 --> 05:32.440
not a whole lot we can do about it because it is literally rooted in our DNA that developed

05:32.440 --> 05:36.680
before farming and restaurants and electricity and supermarkets and telephones and TV and

05:36.680 --> 05:40.880
the internet and the information overload that inundated us far faster than evolution

05:40.880 --> 05:42.940
could possibly respond.

05:42.940 --> 05:47.680
We are dumb monkeys using our dumb monkey brains to trick other dumb monkeys into giving

05:47.680 --> 05:52.120
other dumb monkeys attention, and there's nothing we can do about it.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.320
So, we react more quickly and with more force to the negative.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.640
It follows, then, that our eyes are naturally drawn first towards the day's bad news.

06:01.640 --> 06:05.800
But the trend towards the negative starts even before you, the consumer—it begins

06:05.800 --> 06:07.600
with the journalist.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.680
Subject to the same natural negativity bias, it's more likely that what a journalist

06:11.680 --> 06:15.000
ends up pitching to their editor takes on a negative slant.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.280
Subconsciously, it just feels more important to cover, more exciting to follow, and carries

06:19.280 --> 06:22.000
more potential to captivate an audience.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.160
This negative lean, of course, goes up the line—influencing the editor that then green

06:26.160 --> 06:30.480
lines the story, the news institution that publishes the story, and the award juries

06:30.480 --> 06:32.520
that recognize exceptional work.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.640
Next, the negativity bias gets rewarded by the public.

06:35.640 --> 06:40.040
It supplies a demand—receiving clicks, views, engagement, outrage, and attention from people

06:40.040 --> 06:42.520
who can't help but react to the bad news.

06:42.520 --> 06:47.580
It's all pretty intuitive—bad news proliferates because it's biologically what reporters

06:47.580 --> 06:51.540
are drawn to report on and consumers are drawn to consume.

06:51.620 --> 06:56.260
But none of this explains why some countries' media is more negative than others.

06:56.260 --> 07:01.140
That has less to do with human nature, and more with how a society goes about making

07:01.140 --> 07:02.420
news.

07:02.420 --> 07:07.020
Among journalists, there's surprisingly little consensus as to what exactly is defined

07:07.020 --> 07:08.020
as news.

07:08.020 --> 07:12.260
Sure, there's a dictionary definition, but it's so broad that it might be easier to

07:12.260 --> 07:15.000
identify what news isn't than is.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.780
A functional definition, on the other hand, has proved hard to come by and harder to agree

07:19.780 --> 07:20.780
on.

07:21.020 --> 07:25.620
Among journalists, news is news when it fits into one or more of these particular, identifiable

07:25.620 --> 07:26.620
bins.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.260
For others, the list slightly differs.

07:29.260 --> 07:33.820
For others, still, the notion of even trying to qualify what actually counts as news is

07:33.820 --> 07:34.820
too much to ask.

07:34.820 --> 07:38.500
You know it when you see it—it simply is.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.880
Zoom out further, and questions become more vexing.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.020
What is news for?

07:43.020 --> 07:45.260
Is it entertainment, or a public service?

07:45.260 --> 07:50.300
Whose role is it to produce and provide the news—the state or independent organizations?

07:50.300 --> 07:54.300
Who does the news serve—stakeholders, shareholders, the state, the public?

07:54.300 --> 07:59.140
But while these questions might keep academics up at night, media institutions answer them

07:59.140 --> 08:04.200
every moment of every day with every piece they publish—offering through example after

08:04.200 --> 08:09.740
example of exactly what that particular society has decided to define as news and the purpose

08:09.740 --> 08:10.900
of news.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.940
For decades, critical onlookers have scanned America's pro-private, hyper-competitive,

08:15.940 --> 08:20.220
for-profit media landscape, and have drawn two broad conclusions.

08:20.220 --> 08:24.220
It tends to be more negative than most, and it's getting more negative.

08:24.220 --> 08:29.300
What's been more difficult, though, was proving to what extent, if any, US media skewed

08:29.300 --> 08:31.620
more negatively than other nations.

08:31.620 --> 08:35.220
With different events impacting different countries, after all, and with different cultural

08:35.220 --> 08:40.020
assumptions as to what different events mean, it's nearly impossible drawing a clean comparison

08:40.020 --> 08:42.180
between any two nations' media.

08:42.180 --> 08:46.540
Maybe, in a bigger country, there's just too much bad happening to leave airtime for

08:46.540 --> 08:47.540
the good.

08:47.540 --> 08:52.780
Well, that was until one story came to impact every single media market on the planet at

08:52.780 --> 08:55.480
the exact same time.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.880
Really like no other phenomena before it, the COVID-19 pandemic and its near-universal

08:59.880 --> 09:05.100
weight offered the rarest of opportunities to compare media tone across countries.

09:05.100 --> 09:09.840
Some identified the chance, and in early 2021, this paper, analyzing and comparing English

09:09.840 --> 09:13.780
language stories' approach to reporting on the pandemic, went public.

09:14.020 --> 09:18.500
Collecting some 20,000 COVID articles from these sources in the US and these sources

09:18.500 --> 09:22.440
abroad, the researchers traced the prevalence of negative words and terms to predict the

09:22.440 --> 09:24.200
negative slant of each.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.060
The results were staggering.

09:27.060 --> 09:32.020
This is the negativity trend in international sources across much of 2020, hovering steadily

09:32.020 --> 09:33.580
around 50%.

09:33.580 --> 09:40.020
Then this is the US media, whose COVID-19 coverage leaned negative at a whopping 87%

09:40.020 --> 09:41.020
across the study.

09:41.020 --> 09:45.860
And this vast gulf between just how bad the news is in the US versus the rest of the world

09:45.860 --> 09:51.740
is only exacerbated by these additional findings—that the nation's most popular news sources trend

09:51.740 --> 09:54.420
even more negative than average performers.

09:54.420 --> 10:00.340
Clearly, the negativity bias is working, fueling a vicious cycle that will only lead to more

10:00.340 --> 10:05.300
and more and more of it, and this all feels like a problem.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.300
But maybe it's not.

10:06.300 --> 10:08.760
Maybe it's just a thing.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.920
Overall, this is natural.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.440
Maybe negativity is just how we communicate.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.400
Maybe it's even a good thing—we talk about our issues, meaning we find ways to address

10:17.400 --> 10:18.400
them.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.100
Or maybe it can be both—a simultaneous source and stymie of progress.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.480
Consider it theoretically.

10:24.480 --> 10:27.840
Say negative news gets just 10% more attention.

10:27.840 --> 10:30.680
First, one must consider that it's an arms race.

10:30.680 --> 10:35.000
There are only so many eyeballs, so when the success metric is eyeballs in a competitive

10:35.000 --> 10:39.280
news industry, any edge, be it little, will get captured.

10:39.280 --> 10:46.360
So, a 10% attention edge will lead to 20 or 30 or 40% more negative news, because if everyone

10:46.360 --> 10:51.120
else is doing it, then everybody has to do it—it's an exponential effect.

10:51.120 --> 10:55.200
Next, say there are two stories, but there's only time for one.

10:55.200 --> 10:59.840
The first is on a brand new vaccine—a miracle cure—something that will improve one's

10:59.840 --> 11:02.160
odds of survival by 50%.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.100
The second is on a crime wave—a shooting spree—something that will decrease the odds

11:06.100 --> 11:08.400
of survival by 5%.

11:08.400 --> 11:12.120
In this theoretical environment, that second story wins.

11:12.120 --> 11:16.240
It's scarier, it's more dramatic, it's going to keep the eyeballs from switching

11:16.240 --> 11:18.060
to that other channel.

11:18.060 --> 11:20.160
This will kill people.

11:20.160 --> 11:24.520
The crime wave might stop, the attention might lead to intervention, but all the while, more

11:24.520 --> 11:29.020
people are dying of a preventable disease—an epidemic that could have been stopped if only

11:29.020 --> 11:32.780
people had heard of that new miracle cure.

11:32.780 --> 11:38.060
In our heads, problems feel far more significant than potential—we'd much rather solve

11:38.060 --> 11:41.120
a problem than capture potential.

11:41.120 --> 11:45.500
Early in the COVID pandemic, there was no news but COVID news, but not all was negative.

11:45.500 --> 11:50.420
There were times when things got better—for every upslope, there was a downslope, but you

11:50.420 --> 11:53.020
could hardly tell based on the news.

11:53.020 --> 11:57.140
Research into the matter found that the degree of negativity of COVID news had little, in

11:57.140 --> 12:01.960
fact, sometimes inverse correlation with the COVID case count at the given moment.

12:01.960 --> 12:05.500
This meant that, while a news consumer might have theoretically known that things were

12:05.500 --> 12:10.020
comparatively better or worse, it didn't necessarily feel that way since the tone of

12:10.020 --> 12:13.220
the media inputs stayed consistently dire.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.220
This did have an impact.

12:15.220 --> 12:20.500
Now, with retrospect, we understand the cost of COVID precautions.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.480
Precautions got in the way of precautions.

12:22.480 --> 12:26.380
The persistence of mask mandates and school closures and border restrictions led to a

12:26.380 --> 12:30.180
changing calculus of when these should have been implemented in the public's minds.

12:30.180 --> 12:34.740
Think of it like this—if a town will have only tolerated 12 months of mask mandates

12:34.740 --> 12:39.460
over 36 months of the pandemic, they probably should have been applied here, as hospitalizations

12:39.460 --> 12:44.700
and deaths were rising most quickly, but rather, on average, they were applied here—at the

12:44.700 --> 12:49.480
start—distretching until tolerance waned, meaning a limited supply of precaution was

12:49.480 --> 12:52.940
wasted on times when cases were naturally waning.

12:52.940 --> 12:56.860
Of course this sort of rationality can only be applied in retrospect, but it demonstrates

12:56.860 --> 13:01.620
the impact—we were incapable of properly assessing risk, perhaps in part because our

13:01.620 --> 13:05.660
information inputs didn't modulate tone in step with the risk.

13:05.660 --> 13:11.040
Things always felt at their worst, so it never felt like the moment for a reprieve.

13:11.040 --> 13:16.380
Take another, dramatically different example—research has demonstrated that US presidents, in elections

13:16.380 --> 13:21.280
for a second term, are penalized more for a worsening economy than rewarded for an improving

13:21.280 --> 13:22.280
one.

13:22.280 --> 13:26.640
That's not to say, making the economy 5% worse matters a lot more to the electorate

13:26.640 --> 13:31.140
than making the economy 5% better, possibly because the public hardly knows when things

13:31.140 --> 13:35.120
are getting better—the media doesn't talk about it, only the reverse.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.980
But what the electorate should optimize for is the president who is best at improving

13:38.980 --> 13:43.800
the economy, and so this skew means there's ever so slight irrationality in how we assess

13:43.800 --> 13:44.800
a politician.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.960
We've potentially voted out presidents, and more often other politicians, irrationally

13:48.960 --> 13:51.280
because we don't have an understanding of their accomplishments.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.320
It's a game of who's more terrible rather than who's the best.

13:55.320 --> 14:00.280
So the news operates as perhaps a distorted funhouse mirror of society.

14:00.280 --> 14:05.960
It is mostly accurate, it mostly conveys the truth, but waiting matters.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.740
The public makes inferences based on the quantity and frequency of information, and so this

14:10.740 --> 14:17.540
distorted mirror does inject irrational information into both democratic and individual decision-making.

14:17.540 --> 14:18.920
There are interventions.

14:18.920 --> 14:23.780
We know this because we know this negativity bias is at its worst in the US.

14:23.780 --> 14:28.060
Australia and the UK, for example, are close cultural cousins to the US, and yet their

14:28.060 --> 14:30.900
media tends to be far less negative.

14:30.900 --> 14:35.700
Perhaps the most notable difference in their media landscape is the dominance of public

14:35.700 --> 14:36.700
broadcasters.

14:36.700 --> 14:41.140
The Australian and British broadcasting corporations are incredibly influential in shaping public

14:41.140 --> 14:45.820
opinion in their respective countries, and do so without needing to so fiercely compete

14:45.820 --> 14:46.820
to attract eyeballs.

14:46.820 --> 14:51.420
They can optimize for quality of information over eyeballs attracted, as their funding

14:51.420 --> 14:54.060
is less directly tied to quantity of eyeballs.

14:54.060 --> 14:58.460
They each rely on money from the public, funded through the government, meaning the metric

14:58.460 --> 15:02.300
of success is providing a service the public considers worthwhile.

15:02.300 --> 15:06.500
But inevitably, everyone's definition of worthwhile is different.

15:06.500 --> 15:11.060
True autonomy from the government, while relying on politicians to continue to authorize funding,

15:11.060 --> 15:15.840
is near impossible to achieve, and public broadcasters constantly face scandals for

15:15.860 --> 15:18.800
failing to properly critique those who write their checks.

15:18.800 --> 15:24.100
So, while negativity might be lower, some might ask at what cost.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.320
True media autonomy is essentially impossible under a public funding model.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.720
True tone balance is essentially impossible under an ad-supported model.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.940
There's really no perfect option, and at the end of the day, it's not a question

15:35.940 --> 15:40.280
of if there's negativity bias, just how much.

15:40.280 --> 15:44.520
When we look into a distorted funhouse mirror, we don't think our heads actually look that

15:44.520 --> 15:49.720
big or our stature is actually that short or our hips are actually that wide, because

15:49.720 --> 15:51.240
we know that's not reality.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.880
We've seen ourselves in normal mirrors, so we know what we actually look like.

15:54.880 --> 15:59.640
But if you never saw yourself through a normal mirror, if that funhouse option was it, you

15:59.640 --> 16:05.560
might know that your head and height and hips are not that size, but slowly, you'd forget

16:05.560 --> 16:07.520
by just how much.

16:07.520 --> 16:12.580
You'd forget what you actually look like—blind to yourself, left only with the choice of

16:12.580 --> 16:17.400
avoiding the mirror, rejecting any sort of self-reflection, or accepting a flawed image

16:17.400 --> 16:22.480
because it's really the only mirror you have.

16:22.480 --> 16:27.060
Access to information is undoubtedly important, and there has perhaps never been a more powerful

16:27.060 --> 16:28.580
tool for this than the internet.

16:28.580 --> 16:33.500
But as the power of the internet has increased, there's been a worrying trend towards its

16:33.500 --> 16:34.500
nationalization.

16:34.500 --> 16:38.100
The internet should be the exact same no matter where you are, but it's not.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.860
There are an increasing number of censorship firewalls, legislation limiting where you

16:41.860 --> 16:45.660
can access what, and different versions of sites depending on the country.

16:45.660 --> 16:49.100
I encounter this all the time when researching for videos.

16:49.100 --> 16:52.100
Sometimes I'm trying to watch a British news report on YouTube that's blocked in

16:52.100 --> 16:56.940
the US, or read an American website when traveling in Europe that's blocked due to GDPR legislation.

16:56.940 --> 17:02.140
That's why our sponsor, NordVPN, is a crucial tool for making your internet experience as

17:02.140 --> 17:03.820
free and open as possible.

17:03.820 --> 17:07.820
You're able to route your traffic through servers in any one of 60 countries, so you

17:07.820 --> 17:11.400
might be sitting in Illinois, but as far as your computer's concerned, you're in

17:11.400 --> 17:13.780
London or Tokyo or Sydney.

17:13.780 --> 17:17.420
And this matters for more than just accessing the different versions of the internet.

17:17.420 --> 17:21.340
If you're on public wifi or in certain countries with government surveillance programs, routing

17:21.340 --> 17:25.300
your traffic through a VPN is a crucial way to make sure that you get the privacy and

17:25.300 --> 17:28.900
safety you deserve, and with Nord's new threat protection, it can keep you safe from

17:28.900 --> 17:32.540
phishing links and malware, while also letting you know when any of your information has

17:32.540 --> 17:33.540
been leaked recently.

17:33.540 --> 17:37.520
But you probably already know this—VPNs aren't a new concept, and while they might

17:37.520 --> 17:40.720
be more crucial than ever, there are plenty of options.

17:40.720 --> 17:46.000
The reason I use NordVPN is because they recognize that and have worked to become the best.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.840
They use next-generation encryption to ensure your privacy, they use a dedicated IP to avoid

17:50.840 --> 17:54.560
VPN blockers, and they have super fast speeds so you don't even notice you're using

17:54.560 --> 17:59.040
a VPN, and they just introduced a lightweight browser extension that allows you to customize

17:59.040 --> 18:01.440
which websites you use a VPN for.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.640
I consider VPNs worth it just for the entertainment benefits—being able to unlock the streaming

18:05.640 --> 18:10.080
libraries of other countries—but then there's so much more on top of that, and NordVPN

18:10.080 --> 18:13.880
gives you the best experience possible, so I'd absolutely recommend it, especially

18:13.880 --> 18:16.000
considering the deal they're offering right now.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.420
