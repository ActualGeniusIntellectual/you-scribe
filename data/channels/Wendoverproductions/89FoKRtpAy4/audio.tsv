0	3720	The end might not be near.
3720	6880	Doom might not be inevitable.
6880	9480	But not according to the news.
9480	14480	After a weekend of dramatic White House emergency actions, US President-
14480	20240	Biden has given the go-ahead for a controversial oil drilling scheme, environmentalists say
20240	21820	it's a carbon bomb.
21820	27380	And despite a wet winter in the West, persistent drought and overdevelopment cause record low
27380	48100	water levels for tens of millions of Americans.
48100	49380	Imagine a forest.
49380	50740	Imagine it's your home.
50740	53920	It's both your shelter and your source of sustenance.
53920	58940	It offers rocks to make axes, timber to build shelters, but most importantly, berries and
58940	64760	nuts and ducks and all sorts of food, but to get to it, you have to go out.
64760	66760	Out is scary.
66760	68760	Out is where the threats are.
68760	70400	You're on a path.
70400	71900	Your sightlines are limited.
71900	73480	This forces you to walk.
73480	74580	To search.
74580	79580	As a necessity for survival, to find the food that will feed you, your mate, or your child
79580	84300	that will ensure a slightly altered copy of your DNA gets copied once again, to keep
84300	88180	the species alive, you need to tread into the unknown.
88180	95900	So you walk, and you search, and you walk, and you search, and you walk, and you search,
95900	98860	and you walk, and you- bear, there's a bear!
98860	102420	Epinephrine, cortisol, your heart rate spikes, breathing quickens, blood vessels contract,
102420	106100	digestion stops, your vision focuses, your pupils dilate, your hearing drops out, your
106100	111260	muscles tense, and within an instant, your body has reworked itself—reprioritize resources,
111260	115380	switching from a physiological state suited to exploring to one that can best assess,
115380	117740	address, or evade a threat.
117740	121900	This split-second moment of identifying a threat has occurred immeasurable times through
121900	126260	human history, ending in immeasurable different outcomes, but each of these outcomes can be
126260	131800	categorized into one of two categories—survival or death.
131800	136200	Various factors altered each—a slippery rock slowed to retreat, a convenient cave
136200	140840	offered refuge, a blunt spear inhibited a defense—but when summing up the total of
140840	144440	those immeasurable instances, there was a pattern.
144440	149480	The degree of that physiological response correlated to the likelihood of survival.
149480	155540	How well muscles tense, how much vision focused, how quickly cortisol released—all this mattered
155540	160760	to whether or not a human survived an encounter with a threat, so, through the totality of
160760	165800	humanity, the DNA that created humans with a stronger response to the negative was more
165800	168360	likely to get recreated through offspring.
168360	169600	That's evolution.
169600	171800	But that's also a theory.
171800	176200	What we do know with certainty is that today's humans respond more strongly to a negative
176200	181840	stimulus than a positive one, even when those two stimuli are objectively equal in weight.
181840	183960	Think back to high school—what do you remember?
183960	188160	The great jokes you told, or all the awkward encounters?
188160	192520	This disproportionate response is something that we can and have proved time and time
192520	196920	again in academic research, so we call it the negativity bias.
196920	201320	But what we can't directly prove is whether or not this is something natural—something
201320	205320	rooted in our DNA, crafted by evolution, or if it's cultural.
205320	208320	Maybe society overemphasizes negative moments.
208320	212320	Maybe the awkward encounters from middle school really did have more of an impact on others'
212320	216800	perception of us than the great jokes, and so we've learned to react to them appropriately.
216840	222440	But evolution leaves its fingerprints, and natural experiments can search for them.
222440	226000	Certain humans are male, certain others are female, and the most critical component of
226000	228500	evolution is reproduction.
228500	233100	During human pregnancy, the evolutionary influence of parental death differs depending on whether
233100	235600	it occurs to a father or mother.
235600	239760	If a father dies, the likelihood of reproductive success does go down.
239760	244840	There's then only one individual in a diminished physical state to find food and fight off
244840	247400	threats, but there's still a chance.
247400	250640	If the mother dies, however, that's it.
250640	252300	Reproduction fails.
252300	253300	Evolution stops.
253300	259120	But simultaneously, in an era when pregnancy was far more perilous than today, reproductive
259120	262160	success went up when food was more plentiful.
262160	266720	Therefore, the chance of a father's DNA getting passed on increased as they found
266720	271360	more food, but to do so, they couldn't be too worried about the negative—the threats.
271400	275720	They needed to be motivated to take the level of risk that optimizes for finding the most
275720	279680	food possible, even if it increases their chances of death.
279680	284920	Meanwhile, the mother, with far higher and more direct evolutionary pressure to survive,
284920	288740	must first and foremost focus on her and her child's survival.
288740	293160	Her fight or flight response needs to be huge so she's able to best respond to any threat
293160	294880	that she might encounter.
294880	298280	When studied, the facts support this theory.
298280	302540	Female humans exhibit a weaker negativity bias than female ones.
302540	307080	They still have the bias—they still respond disproportionately to the negative—but not
307080	308480	quite as strongly.
308480	312840	It seems like evolution worked, crafting a structure that appropriately optimized for
312840	315720	the greatest likelihood of successful reproduction.
315720	317780	So, the case is made.
317780	322200	As best we can tell, the negativity bias was not learned—it was evolved.
322200	323720	It's natural.
323720	327920	The positive just doesn't elicit the same emotional response in humans, and there's
327920	332440	not a whole lot we can do about it because it is literally rooted in our DNA that developed
332440	336680	before farming and restaurants and electricity and supermarkets and telephones and TV and
336680	340880	the internet and the information overload that inundated us far faster than evolution
340880	342940	could possibly respond.
342940	347680	We are dumb monkeys using our dumb monkey brains to trick other dumb monkeys into giving
347680	352120	other dumb monkeys attention, and there's nothing we can do about it.
352120	356320	So, we react more quickly and with more force to the negative.
356320	361640	It follows, then, that our eyes are naturally drawn first towards the day's bad news.
361640	365800	But the trend towards the negative starts even before you, the consumer—it begins
365800	367600	with the journalist.
367600	371680	Subject to the same natural negativity bias, it's more likely that what a journalist
371680	375000	ends up pitching to their editor takes on a negative slant.
375000	379280	Subconsciously, it just feels more important to cover, more exciting to follow, and carries
379280	382000	more potential to captivate an audience.
382000	386160	This negative lean, of course, goes up the line—influencing the editor that then green
386160	390480	lines the story, the news institution that publishes the story, and the award juries
390480	392520	that recognize exceptional work.
392520	395640	Next, the negativity bias gets rewarded by the public.
395640	400040	It supplies a demand—receiving clicks, views, engagement, outrage, and attention from people
400040	402520	who can't help but react to the bad news.
402520	407580	It's all pretty intuitive—bad news proliferates because it's biologically what reporters
407580	411540	are drawn to report on and consumers are drawn to consume.
411620	416260	But none of this explains why some countries' media is more negative than others.
416260	421140	That has less to do with human nature, and more with how a society goes about making
421140	422420	news.
422420	427020	Among journalists, there's surprisingly little consensus as to what exactly is defined
427020	428020	as news.
428020	432260	Sure, there's a dictionary definition, but it's so broad that it might be easier to
432260	435000	identify what news isn't than is.
435000	439780	A functional definition, on the other hand, has proved hard to come by and harder to agree
439780	440780	on.
441020	445620	Among journalists, news is news when it fits into one or more of these particular, identifiable
445620	446620	bins.
446620	449260	For others, the list slightly differs.
449260	453820	For others, still, the notion of even trying to qualify what actually counts as news is
453820	454820	too much to ask.
454820	458500	You know it when you see it—it simply is.
458500	461880	Zoom out further, and questions become more vexing.
461880	463020	What is news for?
463020	465260	Is it entertainment, or a public service?
465260	470300	Whose role is it to produce and provide the news—the state or independent organizations?
470300	474300	Who does the news serve—stakeholders, shareholders, the state, the public?
474300	479140	But while these questions might keep academics up at night, media institutions answer them
479140	484200	every moment of every day with every piece they publish—offering through example after
484200	489740	example of exactly what that particular society has decided to define as news and the purpose
489740	490900	of news.
490900	495940	For decades, critical onlookers have scanned America's pro-private, hyper-competitive,
495940	500220	for-profit media landscape, and have drawn two broad conclusions.
500220	504220	It tends to be more negative than most, and it's getting more negative.
504220	509300	What's been more difficult, though, was proving to what extent, if any, US media skewed
509300	511620	more negatively than other nations.
511620	515220	With different events impacting different countries, after all, and with different cultural
515220	520020	assumptions as to what different events mean, it's nearly impossible drawing a clean comparison
520020	522180	between any two nations' media.
522180	526540	Maybe, in a bigger country, there's just too much bad happening to leave airtime for
526540	527540	the good.
527540	532780	Well, that was until one story came to impact every single media market on the planet at
532780	535480	the exact same time.
535480	539880	Really like no other phenomena before it, the COVID-19 pandemic and its near-universal
539880	545100	weight offered the rarest of opportunities to compare media tone across countries.
545100	549840	Some identified the chance, and in early 2021, this paper, analyzing and comparing English
549840	553780	language stories' approach to reporting on the pandemic, went public.
554020	558500	Collecting some 20,000 COVID articles from these sources in the US and these sources
558500	562440	abroad, the researchers traced the prevalence of negative words and terms to predict the
562440	564200	negative slant of each.
564200	567060	The results were staggering.
567060	572020	This is the negativity trend in international sources across much of 2020, hovering steadily
572020	573580	around 50%.
573580	580020	Then this is the US media, whose COVID-19 coverage leaned negative at a whopping 87%
580020	581020	across the study.
581020	585860	And this vast gulf between just how bad the news is in the US versus the rest of the world
585860	591740	is only exacerbated by these additional findings—that the nation's most popular news sources trend
591740	594420	even more negative than average performers.
594420	600340	Clearly, the negativity bias is working, fueling a vicious cycle that will only lead to more
600340	605300	and more and more of it, and this all feels like a problem.
605300	606300	But maybe it's not.
606300	608760	Maybe it's just a thing.
608760	610920	Overall, this is natural.
610920	613440	Maybe negativity is just how we communicate.
613440	617400	Maybe it's even a good thing—we talk about our issues, meaning we find ways to address
617400	618400	them.
618400	623100	Or maybe it can be both—a simultaneous source and stymie of progress.
623100	624480	Consider it theoretically.
624480	627840	Say negative news gets just 10% more attention.
627840	630680	First, one must consider that it's an arms race.
630680	635000	There are only so many eyeballs, so when the success metric is eyeballs in a competitive
635000	639280	news industry, any edge, be it little, will get captured.
639280	646360	So, a 10% attention edge will lead to 20 or 30 or 40% more negative news, because if everyone
646360	651120	else is doing it, then everybody has to do it—it's an exponential effect.
651120	655200	Next, say there are two stories, but there's only time for one.
655200	659840	The first is on a brand new vaccine—a miracle cure—something that will improve one's
659840	662160	odds of survival by 50%.
662160	666100	The second is on a crime wave—a shooting spree—something that will decrease the odds
666100	668400	of survival by 5%.
668400	672120	In this theoretical environment, that second story wins.
672120	676240	It's scarier, it's more dramatic, it's going to keep the eyeballs from switching
676240	678060	to that other channel.
678060	680160	This will kill people.
680160	684520	The crime wave might stop, the attention might lead to intervention, but all the while, more
684520	689020	people are dying of a preventable disease—an epidemic that could have been stopped if only
689020	692780	people had heard of that new miracle cure.
692780	698060	In our heads, problems feel far more significant than potential—we'd much rather solve
698060	701120	a problem than capture potential.
701120	705500	Early in the COVID pandemic, there was no news but COVID news, but not all was negative.
705500	710420	There were times when things got better—for every upslope, there was a downslope, but you
710420	713020	could hardly tell based on the news.
713020	717140	Research into the matter found that the degree of negativity of COVID news had little, in
717140	721960	fact, sometimes inverse correlation with the COVID case count at the given moment.
721960	725500	This meant that, while a news consumer might have theoretically known that things were
725500	730020	comparatively better or worse, it didn't necessarily feel that way since the tone of
730020	733220	the media inputs stayed consistently dire.
733220	735220	This did have an impact.
735220	740500	Now, with retrospect, we understand the cost of COVID precautions.
740500	742480	Precautions got in the way of precautions.
742480	746380	The persistence of mask mandates and school closures and border restrictions led to a
746380	750180	changing calculus of when these should have been implemented in the public's minds.
750180	754740	Think of it like this—if a town will have only tolerated 12 months of mask mandates
754740	759460	over 36 months of the pandemic, they probably should have been applied here, as hospitalizations
759460	764700	and deaths were rising most quickly, but rather, on average, they were applied here—at the
764700	769480	start—distretching until tolerance waned, meaning a limited supply of precaution was
769480	772940	wasted on times when cases were naturally waning.
772940	776860	Of course this sort of rationality can only be applied in retrospect, but it demonstrates
776860	781620	the impact—we were incapable of properly assessing risk, perhaps in part because our
781620	785660	information inputs didn't modulate tone in step with the risk.
785660	791040	Things always felt at their worst, so it never felt like the moment for a reprieve.
791040	796380	Take another, dramatically different example—research has demonstrated that US presidents, in elections
796380	801280	for a second term, are penalized more for a worsening economy than rewarded for an improving
801280	802280	one.
802280	806640	That's not to say, making the economy 5% worse matters a lot more to the electorate
806640	811140	than making the economy 5% better, possibly because the public hardly knows when things
811140	815120	are getting better—the media doesn't talk about it, only the reverse.
815120	818980	But what the electorate should optimize for is the president who is best at improving
818980	823800	the economy, and so this skew means there's ever so slight irrationality in how we assess
823800	824800	a politician.
824800	828960	We've potentially voted out presidents, and more often other politicians, irrationally
828960	831280	because we don't have an understanding of their accomplishments.
831280	835320	It's a game of who's more terrible rather than who's the best.
835320	840280	So the news operates as perhaps a distorted funhouse mirror of society.
840280	845960	It is mostly accurate, it mostly conveys the truth, but waiting matters.
845960	850740	The public makes inferences based on the quantity and frequency of information, and so this
850740	857540	distorted mirror does inject irrational information into both democratic and individual decision-making.
857540	858920	There are interventions.
858920	863780	We know this because we know this negativity bias is at its worst in the US.
863780	868060	Australia and the UK, for example, are close cultural cousins to the US, and yet their
868060	870900	media tends to be far less negative.
870900	875700	Perhaps the most notable difference in their media landscape is the dominance of public
875700	876700	broadcasters.
876700	881140	The Australian and British broadcasting corporations are incredibly influential in shaping public
881140	885820	opinion in their respective countries, and do so without needing to so fiercely compete
885820	886820	to attract eyeballs.
886820	891420	They can optimize for quality of information over eyeballs attracted, as their funding
891420	894060	is less directly tied to quantity of eyeballs.
894060	898460	They each rely on money from the public, funded through the government, meaning the metric
898460	902300	of success is providing a service the public considers worthwhile.
902300	906500	But inevitably, everyone's definition of worthwhile is different.
906500	911060	True autonomy from the government, while relying on politicians to continue to authorize funding,
911060	915840	is near impossible to achieve, and public broadcasters constantly face scandals for
915860	918800	failing to properly critique those who write their checks.
918800	924100	So, while negativity might be lower, some might ask at what cost.
924100	928320	True media autonomy is essentially impossible under a public funding model.
928320	931720	True tone balance is essentially impossible under an ad-supported model.
931720	935940	There's really no perfect option, and at the end of the day, it's not a question
935940	940280	of if there's negativity bias, just how much.
940280	944520	When we look into a distorted funhouse mirror, we don't think our heads actually look that
944520	949720	big or our stature is actually that short or our hips are actually that wide, because
949720	951240	we know that's not reality.
951240	954880	We've seen ourselves in normal mirrors, so we know what we actually look like.
954880	959640	But if you never saw yourself through a normal mirror, if that funhouse option was it, you
959640	965560	might know that your head and height and hips are not that size, but slowly, you'd forget
965560	967520	by just how much.
967520	972580	You'd forget what you actually look like—blind to yourself, left only with the choice of
972580	977400	avoiding the mirror, rejecting any sort of self-reflection, or accepting a flawed image
977400	982480	because it's really the only mirror you have.
982480	987060	Access to information is undoubtedly important, and there has perhaps never been a more powerful
987060	988580	tool for this than the internet.
988580	993500	But as the power of the internet has increased, there's been a worrying trend towards its
993500	994500	nationalization.
994500	998100	The internet should be the exact same no matter where you are, but it's not.
998100	1001860	There are an increasing number of censorship firewalls, legislation limiting where you
1001860	1005660	can access what, and different versions of sites depending on the country.
1005660	1009100	I encounter this all the time when researching for videos.
1009100	1012100	Sometimes I'm trying to watch a British news report on YouTube that's blocked in
1012100	1016940	the US, or read an American website when traveling in Europe that's blocked due to GDPR legislation.
1016940	1022140	That's why our sponsor, NordVPN, is a crucial tool for making your internet experience as
1022140	1023820	free and open as possible.
1023820	1027820	You're able to route your traffic through servers in any one of 60 countries, so you
1027820	1031400	might be sitting in Illinois, but as far as your computer's concerned, you're in
1031400	1033780	London or Tokyo or Sydney.
1033780	1037420	And this matters for more than just accessing the different versions of the internet.
1037420	1041340	If you're on public wifi or in certain countries with government surveillance programs, routing
1041340	1045300	your traffic through a VPN is a crucial way to make sure that you get the privacy and
1045300	1048900	safety you deserve, and with Nord's new threat protection, it can keep you safe from
1048900	1052540	phishing links and malware, while also letting you know when any of your information has
1052540	1053540	been leaked recently.
1053540	1057520	But you probably already know this—VPNs aren't a new concept, and while they might
1057520	1060720	be more crucial than ever, there are plenty of options.
1060720	1066000	The reason I use NordVPN is because they recognize that and have worked to become the best.
1066000	1070840	They use next-generation encryption to ensure your privacy, they use a dedicated IP to avoid
1070840	1074560	VPN blockers, and they have super fast speeds so you don't even notice you're using
1074560	1079040	a VPN, and they just introduced a lightweight browser extension that allows you to customize
1079040	1081440	which websites you use a VPN for.
1081440	1085640	I consider VPNs worth it just for the entertainment benefits—being able to unlock the streaming
1085640	1090080	libraries of other countries—but then there's so much more on top of that, and NordVPN
1090080	1093880	gives you the best experience possible, so I'd absolutely recommend it, especially
1093880	1096000	considering the deal they're offering right now.
1096000	1100420	It's risk-free with Nord's 30-day money-back guarantee, and for a limited time when you
1100420	1105760	use our link, NordVPN.com slash Wendover, any two-year plan will include four free bonus
1105760	1108640	months and you'll be helping support the channel while you're at it, so click the
