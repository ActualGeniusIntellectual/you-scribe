1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
The end might not be near.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,880
Doom might not be inevitable.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,480
But not according to the news.

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
After a weekend of dramatic White House emergency actions, US President-

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,240
Biden has given the go-ahead for a controversial oil drilling scheme, environmentalists say

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,820
it's a carbon bomb.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:27,380
And despite a wet winter in the West, persistent drought and overdevelopment cause record low

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:48,100
water levels for tens of millions of Americans.

9
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,380
Imagine a forest.

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,740
Imagine it's your home.

11
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,920
It's both your shelter and your source of sustenance.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,940
It offers rocks to make axes, timber to build shelters, but most importantly, berries and

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,760
nuts and ducks and all sorts of food, but to get to it, you have to go out.

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
Out is scary.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,760
Out is where the threats are.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,400
You're on a path.

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,900
Your sightlines are limited.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,480
This forces you to walk.

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,580
To search.

20
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,580
As a necessity for survival, to find the food that will feed you, your mate, or your child

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,300
that will ensure a slightly altered copy of your DNA gets copied once again, to keep

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,180
the species alive, you need to tread into the unknown.

23
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:35,900
So you walk, and you search, and you walk, and you search, and you walk, and you search,

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,860
and you walk, and you- bear, there's a bear!

25
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,420
Epinephrine, cortisol, your heart rate spikes, breathing quickens, blood vessels contract,

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,100
digestion stops, your vision focuses, your pupils dilate, your hearing drops out, your

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,260
muscles tense, and within an instant, your body has reworked itself—reprioritize resources,

28
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,380
switching from a physiological state suited to exploring to one that can best assess,

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,740
address, or evade a threat.

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,900
This split-second moment of identifying a threat has occurred immeasurable times through

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,260
human history, ending in immeasurable different outcomes, but each of these outcomes can be

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,800
categorized into one of two categories—survival or death.

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,200
Various factors altered each—a slippery rock slowed to retreat, a convenient cave

34
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,840
offered refuge, a blunt spear inhibited a defense—but when summing up the total of

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,440
those immeasurable instances, there was a pattern.

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,480
The degree of that physiological response correlated to the likelihood of survival.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,540
How well muscles tense, how much vision focused, how quickly cortisol released—all this mattered

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,760
to whether or not a human survived an encounter with a threat, so, through the totality of

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:45,800
humanity, the DNA that created humans with a stronger response to the negative was more

40
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,360
likely to get recreated through offspring.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,600
That's evolution.

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,800
But that's also a theory.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,200
What we do know with certainty is that today's humans respond more strongly to a negative

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:01,840
stimulus than a positive one, even when those two stimuli are objectively equal in weight.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,960
Think back to high school—what do you remember?

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,160
The great jokes you told, or all the awkward encounters?

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,520
This disproportionate response is something that we can and have proved time and time

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,920
again in academic research, so we call it the negativity bias.

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,320
But what we can't directly prove is whether or not this is something natural—something

50
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,320
rooted in our DNA, crafted by evolution, or if it's cultural.

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Maybe society overemphasizes negative moments.

52
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Maybe the awkward encounters from middle school really did have more of an impact on others'

53
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,800
perception of us than the great jokes, and so we've learned to react to them appropriately.

54
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,440
But evolution leaves its fingerprints, and natural experiments can search for them.

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,000
Certain humans are male, certain others are female, and the most critical component of

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,500
evolution is reproduction.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,100
During human pregnancy, the evolutionary influence of parental death differs depending on whether

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,600
it occurs to a father or mother.

59
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,760
If a father dies, the likelihood of reproductive success does go down.

60
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,840
There's then only one individual in a diminished physical state to find food and fight off

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,400
threats, but there's still a chance.

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,640
If the mother dies, however, that's it.

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,300
Reproduction fails.

64
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Evolution stops.

65
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:19,120
But simultaneously, in an era when pregnancy was far more perilous than today, reproductive

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,160
success went up when food was more plentiful.

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
Therefore, the chance of a father's DNA getting passed on increased as they found

68
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
more food, but to do so, they couldn't be too worried about the negative—the threats.

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,720
They needed to be motivated to take the level of risk that optimizes for finding the most

70
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,680
food possible, even if it increases their chances of death.

71
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,920
Meanwhile, the mother, with far higher and more direct evolutionary pressure to survive,

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,740
must first and foremost focus on her and her child's survival.

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,160
Her fight or flight response needs to be huge so she's able to best respond to any threat

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,880
that she might encounter.

75
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,280
When studied, the facts support this theory.

76
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,540
Female humans exhibit a weaker negativity bias than female ones.

77
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,080
They still have the bias—they still respond disproportionately to the negative—but not

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,480
quite as strongly.

79
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,840
It seems like evolution worked, crafting a structure that appropriately optimized for

80
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,720
the greatest likelihood of successful reproduction.

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,780
So, the case is made.

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,200
As best we can tell, the negativity bias was not learned—it was evolved.

83
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,720
It's natural.

84
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,920
The positive just doesn't elicit the same emotional response in humans, and there's

85
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,440
not a whole lot we can do about it because it is literally rooted in our DNA that developed

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,680
before farming and restaurants and electricity and supermarkets and telephones and TV and

87
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,880
the internet and the information overload that inundated us far faster than evolution

88
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,940
could possibly respond.

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,680
We are dumb monkeys using our dumb monkey brains to trick other dumb monkeys into giving

90
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,120
other dumb monkeys attention, and there's nothing we can do about it.

91
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,320
So, we react more quickly and with more force to the negative.

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,640
It follows, then, that our eyes are naturally drawn first towards the day's bad news.

93
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,800
But the trend towards the negative starts even before you, the consumer—it begins

94
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,600
with the journalist.

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
Subject to the same natural negativity bias, it's more likely that what a journalist

96
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,000
ends up pitching to their editor takes on a negative slant.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,280
Subconsciously, it just feels more important to cover, more exciting to follow, and carries

98
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,000
more potential to captivate an audience.

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,160
This negative lean, of course, goes up the line—influencing the editor that then green

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,480
lines the story, the news institution that publishes the story, and the award juries

101
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,520
that recognize exceptional work.

102
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,640
Next, the negativity bias gets rewarded by the public.

103
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,040
It supplies a demand—receiving clicks, views, engagement, outrage, and attention from people

104
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,520
who can't help but react to the bad news.

105
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,580
It's all pretty intuitive—bad news proliferates because it's biologically what reporters

106
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,540
are drawn to report on and consumers are drawn to consume.

107
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,260
But none of this explains why some countries' media is more negative than others.

108
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,140
That has less to do with human nature, and more with how a society goes about making

109
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,420
news.

110
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,020
Among journalists, there's surprisingly little consensus as to what exactly is defined

111
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
as news.

112
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,260
Sure, there's a dictionary definition, but it's so broad that it might be easier to

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,000
identify what news isn't than is.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,780
A functional definition, on the other hand, has proved hard to come by and harder to agree

115
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
on.

116
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,620
Among journalists, news is news when it fits into one or more of these particular, identifiable

117
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,620
bins.

118
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,260
For others, the list slightly differs.

119
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,820
For others, still, the notion of even trying to qualify what actually counts as news is

120
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,820
too much to ask.

121
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,500
You know it when you see it—it simply is.

122
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,880
Zoom out further, and questions become more vexing.

123
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,020
What is news for?

124
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,260
Is it entertainment, or a public service?

125
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:50,300
Whose role is it to produce and provide the news—the state or independent organizations?

126
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Who does the news serve—stakeholders, shareholders, the state, the public?

127
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,140
But while these questions might keep academics up at night, media institutions answer them

128
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,200
every moment of every day with every piece they publish—offering through example after

129
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,740
example of exactly what that particular society has decided to define as news and the purpose

130
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,900
of news.

131
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,940
For decades, critical onlookers have scanned America's pro-private, hyper-competitive,

132
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,220
for-profit media landscape, and have drawn two broad conclusions.

133
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,220
It tends to be more negative than most, and it's getting more negative.

134
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,300
What's been more difficult, though, was proving to what extent, if any, US media skewed

135
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,620
more negatively than other nations.

136
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,220
With different events impacting different countries, after all, and with different cultural

137
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,020
assumptions as to what different events mean, it's nearly impossible drawing a clean comparison

138
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,180
between any two nations' media.

139
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,540
Maybe, in a bigger country, there's just too much bad happening to leave airtime for

140
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
the good.

141
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,780
Well, that was until one story came to impact every single media market on the planet at

142
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,480
the exact same time.

143
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,880
Really like no other phenomena before it, the COVID-19 pandemic and its near-universal

144
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,100
weight offered the rarest of opportunities to compare media tone across countries.

145
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,840
Some identified the chance, and in early 2021, this paper, analyzing and comparing English

146
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,780
language stories' approach to reporting on the pandemic, went public.

147
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,500
Collecting some 20,000 COVID articles from these sources in the US and these sources

148
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,440
abroad, the researchers traced the prevalence of negative words and terms to predict the

149
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,200
negative slant of each.

150
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,060
The results were staggering.

151
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,020
This is the negativity trend in international sources across much of 2020, hovering steadily

152
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,580
around 50%.

153
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,020
Then this is the US media, whose COVID-19 coverage leaned negative at a whopping 87%

154
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,020
across the study.

155
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,860
And this vast gulf between just how bad the news is in the US versus the rest of the world

156
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:51,740
is only exacerbated by these additional findings—that the nation's most popular news sources trend

157
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,420
even more negative than average performers.

158
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,340
Clearly, the negativity bias is working, fueling a vicious cycle that will only lead to more

159
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:05,300
and more and more of it, and this all feels like a problem.

160
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,300
But maybe it's not.

161
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,760
Maybe it's just a thing.

162
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,920
Overall, this is natural.

163
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,440
Maybe negativity is just how we communicate.

164
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,400
Maybe it's even a good thing—we talk about our issues, meaning we find ways to address

165
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
them.

166
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,100
Or maybe it can be both—a simultaneous source and stymie of progress.

167
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,480
Consider it theoretically.

168
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,840
Say negative news gets just 10% more attention.

169
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,680
First, one must consider that it's an arms race.

170
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,000
There are only so many eyeballs, so when the success metric is eyeballs in a competitive

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,280
news industry, any edge, be it little, will get captured.

172
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,360
So, a 10% attention edge will lead to 20 or 30 or 40% more negative news, because if everyone

173
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:51,120
else is doing it, then everybody has to do it—it's an exponential effect.

174
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,200
Next, say there are two stories, but there's only time for one.

175
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,840
The first is on a brand new vaccine—a miracle cure—something that will improve one's

176
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,160
odds of survival by 50%.

177
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,100
The second is on a crime wave—a shooting spree—something that will decrease the odds

178
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,400
of survival by 5%.

179
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,120
In this theoretical environment, that second story wins.

180
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,240
It's scarier, it's more dramatic, it's going to keep the eyeballs from switching

181
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,060
to that other channel.

182
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,160
This will kill people.

183
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,520
The crime wave might stop, the attention might lead to intervention, but all the while, more

184
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,020
people are dying of a preventable disease—an epidemic that could have been stopped if only

185
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,780
people had heard of that new miracle cure.

186
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:38,060
In our heads, problems feel far more significant than potential—we'd much rather solve

187
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,120
a problem than capture potential.

188
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,500
Early in the COVID pandemic, there was no news but COVID news, but not all was negative.

189
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,420
There were times when things got better—for every upslope, there was a downslope, but you

190
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,020
could hardly tell based on the news.

191
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,140
Research into the matter found that the degree of negativity of COVID news had little, in

192
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,960
fact, sometimes inverse correlation with the COVID case count at the given moment.

193
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,500
This meant that, while a news consumer might have theoretically known that things were

194
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,020
comparatively better or worse, it didn't necessarily feel that way since the tone of

195
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,220
the media inputs stayed consistently dire.

196
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
This did have an impact.

197
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:20,500
Now, with retrospect, we understand the cost of COVID precautions.

198
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,480
Precautions got in the way of precautions.

199
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,380
The persistence of mask mandates and school closures and border restrictions led to a

200
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,180
changing calculus of when these should have been implemented in the public's minds.

201
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,740
Think of it like this—if a town will have only tolerated 12 months of mask mandates

202
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,460
over 36 months of the pandemic, they probably should have been applied here, as hospitalizations

203
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,700
and deaths were rising most quickly, but rather, on average, they were applied here—at the

204
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,480
start—distretching until tolerance waned, meaning a limited supply of precaution was

205
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,940
wasted on times when cases were naturally waning.

206
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,860
Of course this sort of rationality can only be applied in retrospect, but it demonstrates

207
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,620
the impact—we were incapable of properly assessing risk, perhaps in part because our

208
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,660
information inputs didn't modulate tone in step with the risk.

209
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,040
Things always felt at their worst, so it never felt like the moment for a reprieve.

210
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,380
Take another, dramatically different example—research has demonstrated that US presidents, in elections

211
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,280
for a second term, are penalized more for a worsening economy than rewarded for an improving

212
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,280
one.

213
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,640
That's not to say, making the economy 5% worse matters a lot more to the electorate

214
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,140
than making the economy 5% better, possibly because the public hardly knows when things

215
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,120
are getting better—the media doesn't talk about it, only the reverse.

216
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,980
But what the electorate should optimize for is the president who is best at improving

217
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,800
the economy, and so this skew means there's ever so slight irrationality in how we assess

218
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
a politician.

219
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,960
We've potentially voted out presidents, and more often other politicians, irrationally

220
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,280
because we don't have an understanding of their accomplishments.

221
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,320
It's a game of who's more terrible rather than who's the best.

222
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,280
So the news operates as perhaps a distorted funhouse mirror of society.

223
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,960
It is mostly accurate, it mostly conveys the truth, but waiting matters.

224
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,740
The public makes inferences based on the quantity and frequency of information, and so this

225
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:17,540
distorted mirror does inject irrational information into both democratic and individual decision-making.

226
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,920
There are interventions.

227
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,780
We know this because we know this negativity bias is at its worst in the US.

228
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,060
Australia and the UK, for example, are close cultural cousins to the US, and yet their

229
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,900
media tends to be far less negative.

230
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,700
Perhaps the most notable difference in their media landscape is the dominance of public

231
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
broadcasters.

232
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,140
The Australian and British broadcasting corporations are incredibly influential in shaping public

233
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,820
opinion in their respective countries, and do so without needing to so fiercely compete

234
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,820
to attract eyeballs.

235
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,420
They can optimize for quality of information over eyeballs attracted, as their funding

236
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,060
is less directly tied to quantity of eyeballs.

237
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,460
They each rely on money from the public, funded through the government, meaning the metric

238
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,300
of success is providing a service the public considers worthwhile.

239
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,500
But inevitably, everyone's definition of worthwhile is different.

240
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,060
True autonomy from the government, while relying on politicians to continue to authorize funding,

241
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,840
is near impossible to achieve, and public broadcasters constantly face scandals for

242
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,800
failing to properly critique those who write their checks.

243
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,100
So, while negativity might be lower, some might ask at what cost.

244
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,320
True media autonomy is essentially impossible under a public funding model.

245
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,720
True tone balance is essentially impossible under an ad-supported model.

246
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,940
There's really no perfect option, and at the end of the day, it's not a question

247
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,280
of if there's negativity bias, just how much.

248
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,520
When we look into a distorted funhouse mirror, we don't think our heads actually look that

249
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,720
big or our stature is actually that short or our hips are actually that wide, because

250
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,240
we know that's not reality.

251
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,880
We've seen ourselves in normal mirrors, so we know what we actually look like.

252
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,640
But if you never saw yourself through a normal mirror, if that funhouse option was it, you

253
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:05,560
might know that your head and height and hips are not that size, but slowly, you'd forget

254
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,520
by just how much.

255
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,580
You'd forget what you actually look like—blind to yourself, left only with the choice of

256
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,400
avoiding the mirror, rejecting any sort of self-reflection, or accepting a flawed image

257
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,480
because it's really the only mirror you have.

258
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,060
Access to information is undoubtedly important, and there has perhaps never been a more powerful

259
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,580
tool for this than the internet.

260
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,500
But as the power of the internet has increased, there's been a worrying trend towards its

261
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
nationalization.

262
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,100
The internet should be the exact same no matter where you are, but it's not.

263
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,860
There are an increasing number of censorship firewalls, legislation limiting where you

264
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,660
can access what, and different versions of sites depending on the country.

265
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,100
I encounter this all the time when researching for videos.

266
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Sometimes I'm trying to watch a British news report on YouTube that's blocked in

267
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,940
the US, or read an American website when traveling in Europe that's blocked due to GDPR legislation.

268
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,140
That's why our sponsor, NordVPN, is a crucial tool for making your internet experience as

269
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,820
free and open as possible.

270
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,820
You're able to route your traffic through servers in any one of 60 countries, so you

271
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,400
might be sitting in Illinois, but as far as your computer's concerned, you're in

272
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,780
London or Tokyo or Sydney.

273
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:17,420
And this matters for more than just accessing the different versions of the internet.

274
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,340
If you're on public wifi or in certain countries with government surveillance programs, routing

275
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,300
your traffic through a VPN is a crucial way to make sure that you get the privacy and

276
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,900
safety you deserve, and with Nord's new threat protection, it can keep you safe from

277
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,540
phishing links and malware, while also letting you know when any of your information has

278
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
been leaked recently.

279
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,520
But you probably already know this—VPNs aren't a new concept, and while they might

280
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,720
be more crucial than ever, there are plenty of options.

281
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,000
The reason I use NordVPN is because they recognize that and have worked to become the best.

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,840
They use next-generation encryption to ensure your privacy, they use a dedicated IP to avoid

283
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,560
VPN blockers, and they have super fast speeds so you don't even notice you're using

284
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,040
a VPN, and they just introduced a lightweight browser extension that allows you to customize

285
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,440
which websites you use a VPN for.

286
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,640
I consider VPNs worth it just for the entertainment benefits—being able to unlock the streaming

287
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,080
libraries of other countries—but then there's so much more on top of that, and NordVPN

288
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,880
gives you the best experience possible, so I'd absolutely recommend it, especially

289
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,000
considering the deal they're offering right now.

290
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,420
It's risk-free with Nord's 30-day money-back guarantee, and for a limited time when you

291
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,760
use our link, NordVPN.com slash Wendover, any two-year plan will include four free bonus
