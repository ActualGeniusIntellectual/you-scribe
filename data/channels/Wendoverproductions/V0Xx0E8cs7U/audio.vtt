WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.920
It's 4.55am on a March day at the National Weather Service's Twin Cities Forecast Facility

00:05.920 --> 00:10.640
when the morning stillness is broken by the rattle of a garage door opening.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.300
As they do every single morning of every single day, a meteorologist working the station's

00:15.300 --> 00:19.540
public service desk is launching a helium and hydrogen-filled latex balloon connected

00:19.540 --> 00:23.240
to an expendable radio scone by 80 feet of string.

00:23.240 --> 00:28.480
At the very same time, meteorologists from the other 91 NWS radio scone stations across

00:28.480 --> 00:33.800
the US, along with hundreds from around the globe, are launching their own upper-air atmospheric

00:33.800 --> 00:34.800
soundings.

00:34.800 --> 00:39.260
In the next two hours, these balloons will climb up to 100,000 feet, or 300,000 meters

00:39.260 --> 00:43.840
into the atmosphere, drifting as far as 200 miles or 320 kilometers from their launch

00:43.840 --> 00:48.560
point while their payload, about the weight of a grapefruit, relays temperature, air pressure,

00:48.560 --> 00:50.880
and humidity data back to the station.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.480
The technology might be simple, but the readings from various altitudes captured every 12 hours

00:55.480 --> 00:57.720
are simply irreplaceable.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.600
These data, transmitted by radio frequency then scrubbed for errors by the meteorologists

01:01.600 --> 01:05.800
that launched the balloon in the first place, will get compiled and plugged into impossibly

01:05.800 --> 01:09.840
complex models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and then archived

01:09.840 --> 01:13.360
at the National Climate and Data Center, but that's later.

01:13.360 --> 01:18.160
Right now, as the Minneapolis meteorologists follow their highly standardized routine,

01:18.160 --> 01:20.000
one reading catches their eye.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.840
The barometer reads 1,017 millibars—a high-pressure front developing.

01:25.840 --> 01:30.560
For our meteorologists, an Arctic cold front means a few more freezing commutes and balloon

01:30.560 --> 01:31.560
launches.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.480
For the rest of the US, it might not mean much, or it might present a problem.

01:35.480 --> 01:39.860
That's not a conclusion the data from a single balloon can possibly offer.

01:39.860 --> 01:43.780
To fulfill their task of telling the public what's to come, the US's National Weather

01:43.780 --> 01:48.000
Service is going to need far, far more data.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.160
To start, the NWS operates 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars, each dedicating seven

01:54.160 --> 01:58.360
seconds an hour to emitting quick bursts of energy, then the rest listening for its return

01:58.360 --> 02:01.720
to interpret what's present in the sky—water or air.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.880
The multi-million dollar installations are spread out across the 50 states, Puerto Rico,

02:05.880 --> 02:10.960
Guam, and uniquely, at one US military base in Okinawa, Japan, and two others in South

02:10.960 --> 02:15.040
Korea, putting the American National Weather Service in the exceptional position of maintaining

02:15.040 --> 02:18.600
near-complete weather radar coverage over a foreign country.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.920
In the US itself, most metro areas are covered, and the deployment of the system was credited

02:22.920 --> 02:28.220
with increasing average tornado warning times from four to eleven minutes, but still, meaningful

02:28.220 --> 02:29.960
gaps exist.

02:29.960 --> 02:34.480
While gaps over sparsely populated western states are inconvenient obstacles to accurate

02:34.480 --> 02:40.920
forecasts, the NWS lacks visibility into some slivers of the area known as Tornado Alley—an

02:40.920 --> 02:44.780
area that relies on these radars to give them the notice needed to get into shelters when

02:44.780 --> 02:46.660
a tornado does form.

02:46.660 --> 02:50.980
With these NEXRAD radars now out of production and every existing one in use, there is little

02:51.020 --> 02:55.700
opportunity for improvement short of a costly system-wide upgrade, but for the most part,

02:55.700 --> 03:00.940
these 160 radars get the job done and form the foundation of the agency's data collection

03:00.940 --> 03:01.940
mission.

03:01.940 --> 03:07.160
But as groundbreakingly effective radar technology is, it's a proxy for measurements actually

03:07.160 --> 03:08.860
taken in the sky.

03:08.860 --> 03:12.660
This is why the NWS goes through the effort to launch those hundreds of weather balloons

03:12.660 --> 03:17.460
daily, but of course, planes are already up there anyways.

03:17.460 --> 03:21.340
Not only that, but the typical commercial aircraft already has the instruments necessary

03:21.340 --> 03:25.560
to observe atmospheric conditions, so that's why the World Meteorological Organization

03:25.560 --> 03:29.020
set up the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay System.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.580
Forty-three airlines around the world, including Alaska, American, Delta, FedEx, Hawaiian,

03:33.580 --> 03:38.100
Southwest, United, and UPS, have agreed to collect meteorological data in flight and

03:38.100 --> 03:42.500
transmit it to the WMO via satellite or VHF radio.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.900
Meteorologists describe these data as crucial to the accuracy of forecasts, since such frequency

03:47.340 --> 03:51.500
of atmospheric data cannot be inexpensively obtained through any other means.

03:51.500 --> 03:56.780
In fact, forecasts globally became meaningfully less accurate at the start of the COVID pandemic

03:56.780 --> 04:00.900
due to the loss of much of these data as air travel took a downturn.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.220
But as important high-altitude data is to predicting what's to come on the ground,

04:05.220 --> 04:09.160
the NWS still needs to know what's happening on the ground right now.

04:09.160 --> 04:14.100
For that, there are 900 automated surface observation systems, again spread out across

04:14.100 --> 04:17.100
the entire country, primarily at airports.

04:17.100 --> 04:21.460
These include a suite of sensors—temperature, air pressure, humidity, cloud coverage, and

04:21.460 --> 04:26.500
more—that automatically report data back to the NWS, and also automatically broadcast

04:26.500 --> 04:31.060
a radio frequency that pilots can use to gain valuable intel into conditions at their destination

04:31.060 --> 04:32.340
airport.

04:32.340 --> 04:37.140
Some observations, however, cannot be efficiently achieved through automated means.

04:37.140 --> 04:39.260
Some require the human touch.

04:39.260 --> 04:44.100
Precipitation, whether in rain, snow, or something in between, is largely measured by a horde

04:44.100 --> 04:49.620
of unpaid civilian volunteers donating their time to run 9,000 cooperative observer system

04:49.620 --> 04:51.460
sites across the country.

04:51.460 --> 04:55.640
Each follows strict protocol to provide the NWS with a daily precipitation measurement

04:55.640 --> 04:59.460
for their local area, which is the primary manner through which forecasters validate

04:59.460 --> 05:03.300
their forecasts—if they see that precipitation is constantly under their prediction in a

05:03.300 --> 05:06.520
given area, they'll adjust, and vice versa.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.800
These data are also crucial for establishing long-term trends.

05:09.800 --> 05:14.080
It was this program, for example, that observed that average precipitation in the US has grown

05:14.080 --> 05:19.980
7.8% since 1901 due to warming temperatures allowing the atmosphere to hold more water.

05:19.980 --> 05:26.420
A similar, even larger program exists called SkyWarn, where 350,000 trained volunteer weather

05:26.420 --> 05:30.380
spotters work with the NWS to act as their eyes on the ground.

05:30.380 --> 05:34.020
These volunteers, many of which are amateur radio enthusiasts that use their skills to

05:34.020 --> 05:38.660
communicate observations regardless of external conditions, track severe weather to both allow

05:38.660 --> 05:42.800
the NWS to alert others of what's to come, and help them validate their weather models

05:42.800 --> 05:44.300
and forecasts.

05:44.300 --> 05:48.660
But weather is global, and therefore in order to give Americans their forecast, the National

05:48.660 --> 05:52.900
Weather Service requires data from beyond the American states, territories, and few

05:52.900 --> 05:54.420
foreign radar sites.

05:54.420 --> 05:58.300
That's why the World Meteorological Organization exists.

05:58.300 --> 06:02.760
This specialized United Nations agency has myriad responsibilities, but perhaps the most

06:02.760 --> 06:08.100
pivotal centers around ensuring different national forecasters can and do cooperate.

06:08.120 --> 06:13.720
As of a few years ago, data sharing is mandatory among all WMO members, meaning the US's

06:13.720 --> 06:18.280
NWS gets meteorological data from its foreign counterparts, and vice versa, regardless of

06:18.280 --> 06:22.320
their geopolitical status, thus improving the quality of forecasts for all.

06:22.320 --> 06:26.780
As one of the world's preeminent meteorological organizations, the National Weather Service

06:26.780 --> 06:32.680
does, however, have some extra help in gathering data from the rest of the world—satellites.

06:32.680 --> 06:37.360
For decades now, a rotating cast of satellites have held two geostationary positions called

06:37.360 --> 06:42.380
GOES East and GOES West, streaming down a deluge of imagery and meteorological data

06:42.380 --> 06:46.100
to the agency's ground station on Wallops Island, Virginia.

06:46.100 --> 06:51.100
GOES East and West are currently operated by the GOES 16 and 17 satellites, respectively.

06:51.100 --> 06:56.420
In addition, the older GOES 15 satellite sits next to GOES 17 to provide redundant coverage,

06:56.420 --> 07:01.260
due to a reliability issue with 17, while GOES 14 sits powered down in a storage orbit

07:01.260 --> 07:04.360
in case an issue with another requires a quick replacement.

07:04.360 --> 07:08.560
Any gap in coverage from GOES East or West would impact forecast accuracy for hundreds

07:08.560 --> 07:10.380
of millions of Americans.

07:10.380 --> 07:15.940
Meanwhile, GOES 18 was launched in March 2022 and will soon replace GOES 17 to operate as

07:15.940 --> 07:16.940
GOES West.

07:16.940 --> 07:21.420
While these are focused on high-frequency, ongoing coverage of the US and its immediate

07:21.420 --> 07:27.040
surroundings, the agency also operates a non-geostationary satellite in a polar orbit to provide less

07:27.040 --> 07:30.860
frequent yet still important data and imagery of the rest of the world.

07:30.860 --> 07:34.920
A secondary function of these GOES satellites is to act as a means of communication for

07:34.920 --> 07:40.000
the most remote NWS observation stations on earth—BUIs.

07:40.000 --> 07:44.320
Stationed hundreds or thousands of miles offshore, weather BUIs provide a glimpse into areas

07:44.320 --> 07:48.800
of the earth entirely devoid of humans or civilization, but full of weather that could

07:48.800 --> 07:50.400
soon impact them.

07:50.400 --> 07:54.680
The network is run by NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, and each transmits near real-time

07:54.680 --> 07:59.600
conditions from the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Pacific, including giving life-saving

07:59.600 --> 08:03.060
warning of potential impending tsunamis, for example.

08:03.060 --> 08:07.020
More typically, however, they provide the same data land-based stations offer, but in

08:07.020 --> 08:11.240
an area useful for giving coastal regions a heads-up of what's to come.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.300
On the hour, BUIs record temperature and pressure, which is subsequently relayed by the GOES

08:15.300 --> 08:19.760
satellites to the mainland and the supercomputers vacuuming up all possible data to help project

08:19.760 --> 08:21.420
an accurate weather model.

08:21.420 --> 08:25.580
The inclusion of these data may prove a good thing, too, as the same time that this weather

08:25.580 --> 08:30.120
balloon floating over Minnesota is picking up an inbound high-pressure front, this buoy,

08:30.120 --> 08:35.800
number 42019 off the coast of Texas, is reading an above-average air temperature and a below-average

08:35.800 --> 08:36.900
air pressure.

08:36.900 --> 08:42.300
For local forecasters, buoy station 42019, along with other readings, hint at a developing

08:42.300 --> 08:46.360
low-pressure front—some rain might be arriving along the gulf here soon.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.600
But as weather models render, taking into account both an arctic front descending across

08:50.600 --> 08:55.240
the Midwest and a warm, moisture-laden front developing across the gulf, a little rain

08:55.240 --> 08:59.340
might soon be the least of the NWS's worries.

08:59.340 --> 09:04.100
Weather develops at very different scales into very different consequences.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.880
To protect the individual, the thousands, and the millions, the NWS has to predict weather

09:08.880 --> 09:11.640
developments at varying scales.

09:11.640 --> 09:16.300
These predictions of all size and shape all largely emanate from here—the National Centers

09:16.300 --> 09:21.140
for Environmental Predictions Weather Prediction Center, where data from balloons, buoys, planes,

09:21.140 --> 09:24.800
and satellites the world over pours into various weather models.

09:24.800 --> 09:30.640
While the NWS produces a bevy of different models, they broadly all work the same.

09:30.640 --> 09:36.220
In each, numbers representing observed environmental conditions are plugged into a myriad of equations,

09:36.220 --> 09:40.520
the results of which, once overlaid on a map, offer both an approximate snapshot of the

09:40.520 --> 09:45.040
current atmospheric conditions and a simulated future that predicts how weather patterns

09:45.040 --> 09:46.400
will develop and move.

09:46.740 --> 09:51.180
While the same data, the same math, and the same laws of physics undergird all-weather

09:51.180 --> 09:56.420
modeling, it's a model's resolution and range that differentiates one from the next.

09:56.420 --> 10:01.820
The high-resolution rapid refresh model, for example, with its 2-mile, 3-kilometer resolution,

10:01.820 --> 10:07.040
its real-time visualizations, and its every-hour updating, offers unmatched detail and accuracy

10:07.040 --> 10:11.420
on the development of rapid-moving thunderstorms over the next hour, providing meteorologists

10:11.420 --> 10:14.020
more confidence in offering severe weather warnings.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.960
What it can't do is zoom out temporally or spatially to forecast nationwide developments

10:18.960 --> 10:22.480
even hours into the future—its scope is too focused.

10:22.480 --> 10:27.720
It can tell you to evacuate now, but can't help you decide to bring a rain jacket tomorrow.

10:27.720 --> 10:32.240
To help inform such important decisions between rain jackets or sunscreen, meteorologists

10:32.240 --> 10:37.680
use the North American Mesoscale model, which offers lower resolution than the HRRR, but

10:37.680 --> 10:41.800
identifies patterns that forecast their paths out to 61 hours.

10:41.800 --> 10:46.860
For an even broader picture, the NWS relies on the Global Forecast System, which again

10:46.860 --> 10:50.940
takes a broader view than the NAM, but is able to interpret atmospheric patterns and

10:50.940 --> 10:55.940
weather developments of global scale and to predict out to 10 days in the future—critical

10:55.940 --> 10:59.380
in tracking the long developments of hurricanes, for instance.

10:59.380 --> 11:03.260
Together, these models are incredibly powerful predictive tools.

11:03.260 --> 11:07.940
Running all these models, in turn, requires incredibly powerful computers.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.760
What makes all these models possible are two of the largest supercomputers in the US.

11:12.760 --> 11:17.280
In the wake of the NWS's Global Forecast System failing to identify the dangerous potential

11:17.280 --> 11:21.440
of Hurricane Sandy, Congress greenlit increased funding for NOAA.

11:21.440 --> 11:26.280
The result was the 2016 announcement that NOAA had increased its computing power tenfold

11:26.280 --> 11:30.980
with the introduction of two supercomputers in Reston, Virginia and Orlando, Florida.

11:30.980 --> 11:35.960
The $45 million dollar addition put the 18th fastest computer in the US in the hands of

11:35.960 --> 11:41.540
NOAA, which effectively evened the playing field between the NWS and its European counterpart.

11:41.540 --> 11:45.620
Doubling down on the modernization effort, NOAA again invested in its supercomputers

11:45.620 --> 11:51.100
in 2018, adding 60% more storage and more than doubling their computing capacity—moves

11:51.100 --> 11:56.220
which made room for updates and improvements to its models, from the HRRR to the GFS.

11:56.220 --> 12:01.080
Importantly, and further justifying such investment, these supercomputers are not only tasked to

12:01.080 --> 12:06.660
run and re-run and re-run atmospheric models all day, every day, they're also tasked

12:06.660 --> 12:11.440
with creating ensemble models—effectively running these same models time and time again

12:11.440 --> 12:16.020
with the parameters slightly changed to reflect the random chance of real-world weather and

12:16.020 --> 12:20.260
therefore give forecasters an idea of the degree of uncertainty for a given prediction.

12:20.260 --> 12:24.820
If the forecast holds up despite the random chance thrown in by the ensemble model, it's

12:24.820 --> 12:26.780
more certain, and vice versa.

12:26.800 --> 12:32.040
Together, these various models and the supercomputers that run them non-stop are immensely complex

12:32.040 --> 12:33.440
and extremely expensive.

12:33.440 --> 12:39.080
In the past they have proven incredibly valuable when extreme weather arises, and in the future,

12:39.080 --> 12:44.520
as far-flowing disparate signs of storms quietly develop, they'll prove critical to meteorologists

12:44.520 --> 12:46.160
again.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.800
Hours after the launch of a weather balloon in Minnesota, and a Buies upload off the coast

12:49.800 --> 12:54.800
of Texas on an early March day, they're proving their worth again as GFS forecasts

12:54.820 --> 12:59.460
and then ensemble GFS forecasts are beginning to project with higher confidence that a storm

12:59.460 --> 13:02.900
of significant destructive potential may be brewing.

13:02.900 --> 13:07.720
In the days prior, as millibars dropped over Texas, GFS models had identified the early

13:07.720 --> 13:11.420
stages of what meteorologists call a Gulf Low.

13:11.420 --> 13:15.260
Now with Buies proving such predictions correct, and with the concurrent development of a drop

13:15.260 --> 13:19.820
in cold front, they can now predict its direction and potential severity.

13:19.820 --> 13:23.800
While this Gulf Low seems to be mirroring historical patterns in that it too is primed

13:23.820 --> 13:28.020
to move a mountain of moisture out of the Gulf of Mexico, this particular storm, thanks

13:28.020 --> 13:32.140
to the deepening cold front and a U-shaped gulf stream, doesn't look like it will track

13:32.140 --> 13:36.320
along the western edge of the Appalachians, but rather through some of the most densely

13:36.320 --> 13:39.420
populated regions of the American East Coast.

13:39.420 --> 13:45.780
According to GFS forecasting, snow, and a lot of it, is headed northeast.

13:45.780 --> 13:49.620
Of course, forecasts are meaningless by themselves.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.960
To avoid the disaster of an unprepared populace in the firing line of an impending winter

13:53.960 --> 13:59.080
storm, plows still in the parking lot, stores without extra stock, kids still in school,

13:59.080 --> 14:03.880
commuters on the road at the wrong time, the National Weather Service has to actually communicate

14:03.880 --> 14:05.440
what's to come.

14:05.440 --> 14:11.520
To achieve this, the agency has 122 weather forecast offices distributed across the 50

14:11.520 --> 14:16.620
states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, each responsible for a dedicated zone of the country.

14:16.620 --> 14:21.380
A couple dozen staff in each work 24-7 to interpret models and issue forecasts for their

14:21.380 --> 14:23.120
surrounding region.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.880
Perhaps most importantly, though, they monitor and issue alerts for the most localized and

14:26.880 --> 14:32.020
often most dangerous threats—severe thunderstorm, flash flood, tornado warnings, and more all

14:32.020 --> 14:34.200
come from local WFOs.

14:34.200 --> 14:38.460
The on-the-ground presence also allows WFOs to tailor their activities to what's necessary

14:38.460 --> 14:40.140
for the people they serve.

14:40.140 --> 14:45.620
The Fairbanks, Alaska WFO issues a daily climbing weather forecast for nearby Denali, America's

14:45.620 --> 14:46.700
tallest mountain.

14:46.700 --> 14:51.280
The Dodge City, Kansas WFO, surrounded by hundreds of miles of wheat fields, reports

14:51.280 --> 14:54.680
daily soil temperatures so farmers can optimize their yields.

14:54.680 --> 14:59.360
The Grand Junction, Colorado WFO monitors and reports fire weather conditions, alerting

14:59.360 --> 15:03.260
the wildfire-prone area it's responsible for to the daily risk of one starting and

15:03.260 --> 15:08.260
spreading and therefore informing campfire bans, electric grid shutdowns, and more.

15:08.260 --> 15:13.700
Like most WFOs in fire-prone areas, the Grand Junction office also staffs an incident meteorologist

15:13.700 --> 15:17.500
who is prepared to quickly deploy to the field and embed in a wildfire camp to issue

15:17.500 --> 15:22.220
highly specific forecasts used by aerial firefighting pilots, hotshot crews, and other firefighters

15:22.220 --> 15:24.620
to safely approach and attack the burn.

15:24.620 --> 15:30.220
Finally, the local WFOs are responsible for many of the NWS's on-the-ground operations,

15:30.220 --> 15:34.140
from maintaining Doppler radars and automated surface observation stations, to running the

15:34.140 --> 15:37.900
local NWS twitter account, and far, far more.

15:37.900 --> 15:43.560
Ultimately, though, certain weather is just too big or otherworldly to be handled by small,

15:43.560 --> 15:44.900
local WFOs.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.800
For that, there are the national offices.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.800
Some are straightforward.

15:48.800 --> 15:54.560
Rivers, for example, run for hundreds or thousands of miles through countless WFO zones, so there's

15:54.560 --> 15:59.100
an additional system of 13 river forecast centers that split up the lower 48 and Alaska

15:59.100 --> 16:04.460
more or less based on watershed, issuing forecasts for their rivers' flows and, most importantly,

16:04.460 --> 16:05.920
their flood risk.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.400
Perhaps the best known of these national offices is the National Hurricane Center, based in

16:10.400 --> 16:14.560
a bunker-like building in Miami, Florida that's designed and certified to survive

16:14.560 --> 16:18.740
and operate through a category 5 hurricane—the most severe level.

16:18.740 --> 16:23.560
They have the stressful task of predicting the paths and intensities of hurricanes.

16:23.560 --> 16:26.660
If they get it right and people prepare, lives will be saved.

16:26.660 --> 16:31.280
If they miss the forecast, lives will be lost, and they potentially do this all while a hurricane

16:31.280 --> 16:33.000
passes directly over them.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.780
For this reason, the system is structured so the National Weather Prediction Center

16:36.780 --> 16:40.660
in College Park, Maryland is prepared to take over responsibilities in an instant if

16:40.660 --> 16:44.660
the Miami Center goes offline during a storm, while there's also an additional office

16:44.660 --> 16:50.420
in Honolulu, Hawaii that staffs up if a comparatively rare Central Pacific hurricane forms.

16:50.420 --> 16:54.500
Most uniquely, the National Weather Service is also responsible for forecasting the weather

16:54.500 --> 16:58.860
not only beyond the borders of the US, but beyond the borders of this world.

16:58.860 --> 17:02.940
The NWUS's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado takes in data from the

17:02.940 --> 17:07.780
GOES satellites and terrestrial sensors to report current and forecast future solar radiation

17:07.780 --> 17:09.640
and other space weather.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.900
This isn't just for the novelty, as high solar radiation activity, for example, can

17:13.900 --> 17:15.740
impact the human world.

17:15.740 --> 17:20.120
High frequency radio gets disrupted during solar flares, so commercial aircraft can't

17:20.120 --> 17:23.500
fly routes over the poles where they rely on it to talk to air traffic control if the

17:23.500 --> 17:28.480
center is forecasted high levels of radiation—and that's just the very start of issues solar

17:28.480 --> 17:29.780
flares can cause.

17:30.300 --> 17:34.800
Ultimately, though, the totality of the National Weather Service's work, the thousands of

17:34.800 --> 17:39.060
hourly observations from across the world and beyond, the full processing might of two

17:39.060 --> 17:44.460
incredible supercomputers, the collective efforts of thousands of highly trained individuals,

17:44.460 --> 17:51.220
all distills down to this—a couple-megabyte XML data feed updated every few minutes.

17:51.220 --> 17:55.780
Generally, people don't get the weather directly from the National Weather Service—they

17:55.780 --> 17:59.620
get it from the weather app on their phone, the TV meteorologist, or whatever's most

17:59.620 --> 18:01.340
convenient for them.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.780
Nearly every source of weather information in the US relies on the work of the National

18:04.780 --> 18:09.520
Weather Service, even if it's repackaged and rebranded, so the NWUS works to make these

18:09.520 --> 18:13.700
data abundantly accessible to those that get it to the end user.

18:13.700 --> 18:18.160
These XML data feeds are a major source, providing a structured set of current conditions and

18:18.160 --> 18:22.380
forecasts that can be quickly adapted and interpreted by software, and everyone, from

18:22.380 --> 18:27.320
individuals to commercial companies, is legally allowed to use these data since, as a production

18:27.320 --> 18:32.220
of the US government, it is not copyrighted and does not require a license.

18:32.220 --> 18:36.860
Of course, the times when weather information is most important are often also the times

18:36.860 --> 18:41.660
when communications are most difficult—the internet and TV might not be accessible when

18:41.660 --> 18:42.860
it really matters.

18:42.860 --> 18:48.460
Therefore, some 95% of the US population is within range of a NOAA weather radio station,

18:48.460 --> 18:53.260
which automatically broadcasts a 24-7 feed of conditions and forecasts.

18:53.260 --> 18:57.900
As a last resort, the National Weather Service also runs the Emergency Managers Weather Information

18:57.900 --> 19:02.220
Network, which uses their GOES satellites to broadcast a data feed down to earth that

19:02.220 --> 19:06.540
uniquely is accessible to anyone with a compatible satellite receiver.

19:06.540 --> 19:12.320
This data feed, available at 1694.1 MHz, includes all the information of conditions and forecasts

19:12.320 --> 19:17.060
for sites across the US, and even includes these visual forecasts, satellite imagery,

19:17.060 --> 19:21.580
and other images for onward use—allowing TV stations, emergency managers, and others

19:21.580 --> 19:26.900
to access this crucial information regardless of the condition of the world around them.

19:26.900 --> 19:32.440
In sum, this is how the National Weather Service tells the East Coast a snowstorm is coming.

19:32.440 --> 19:37.140
All it requires is a couple of satellites and supercomputers, hundreds of radars, observation

19:37.140 --> 19:41.640
stations, buoys, weather balloons, aircraft, and weather forecast offices, and thousands

19:41.640 --> 19:47.240
upon thousands of dedicated staff and volunteers.

19:47.240 --> 19:50.280
Rather than do the normal style of ad, since given the fact that you're watching this

19:50.280 --> 19:54.760
it hasn't convinced you yet, this time I'm going to count down the top ten of the many

19:54.760 --> 19:58.360
reasons why you should sign up for the Nebula CuriosityStream bundle deal.

19:58.360 --> 20:02.720
Ten, you can watch this and all of our regular videos without ads or sponsorships.

20:02.720 --> 20:07.680
Nine, you can watch other channels like RealLifeLore, Notchish Bikes, Mustard, and far more also

20:07.680 --> 20:09.360
ad and sponsorship free.

20:09.360 --> 20:13.000
Eight, you can watch all of these different big-budget originals that we've made—we've

20:13.000 --> 20:15.520
put a ton of work into each and I think they're all great.

20:15.520 --> 20:19.760
Seven, you can watch every episode from our new channel, Jetlagged the Game, a full week

20:19.760 --> 20:20.760
early.

20:20.760 --> 20:24.480
Six, you can watch all sorts of originals by other independent creators—I'd recommend

20:24.480 --> 20:28.000
Patrick Williams' Night of the Coconut, which is a feature-length multiverse film

20:28.000 --> 20:32.720
about a genocidal coconut—it's tough to explain but it's so much fun and so well-made

20:32.720 --> 20:34.800
and even includes a cameo by me.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.900
Five, you can discover other fantastic channels, as Nebula only includes a curated group of

20:39.900 --> 20:42.480
high-quality, thoughtful creators.

20:42.480 --> 20:46.200
One that I love in a very different genre is Berm Peak, where Seth brings his audience

20:46.200 --> 20:50.940
along to his unbelievable mountain bike trail-building projects in a way that even people with absolutely

20:50.940 --> 20:53.040
no affinity for bikes enjoy.

20:53.040 --> 20:57.160
Four, you can watch the smart, thoughtful content you clearly enjoy without an algorithm

20:57.160 --> 21:00.760
surfacing other clickbaity videos to pull your attention away—it's just you and

21:00.760 --> 21:04.440
the videos, without a platform designed to suck you in for as long as possible.

21:04.440 --> 21:08.360
Three, by watching through Nebula, you'll support all these independent creators and

21:08.360 --> 21:12.440
assure they make a stable income that helps them keep creating everything you love watching.

21:12.440 --> 21:17.280
Two, by signing up through our link, CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you'll get the bundle deal

21:17.280 --> 21:21.520
with CuriosityStream included, meaning you also get access to their fantastic catalog

21:21.520 --> 21:26.840
of top-notch non-fiction shows and documentaries, like Containership XXL, about how the largest

21:26.840 --> 21:29.840
container ship in existence was designed and built.

21:29.840 --> 21:36.600
And number one, all of this costs just $14.79 for a year—that's less than you probably

21:36.600 --> 21:41.160
pay for a month of the other streaming services you use, and this is two of them that you'll

21:41.160 --> 21:42.160
actually use.
