1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
It's 4.55am on a March day at the National Weather Service's Twin Cities Forecast Facility

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,640
when the morning stillness is broken by the rattle of a garage door opening.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,300
As they do every single morning of every single day, a meteorologist working the station's

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,540
public service desk is launching a helium and hydrogen-filled latex balloon connected

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:23,240
to an expendable radio scone by 80 feet of string.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:28,480
At the very same time, meteorologists from the other 91 NWS radio scone stations across

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,800
the US, along with hundreds from around the globe, are launching their own upper-air atmospheric

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
soundings.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,260
In the next two hours, these balloons will climb up to 100,000 feet, or 300,000 meters

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,840
into the atmosphere, drifting as far as 200 miles or 320 kilometers from their launch

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,560
point while their payload, about the weight of a grapefruit, relays temperature, air pressure,

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,880
and humidity data back to the station.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,480
The technology might be simple, but the readings from various altitudes captured every 12 hours

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,720
are simply irreplaceable.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,600
These data, transmitted by radio frequency then scrubbed for errors by the meteorologists

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,800
that launched the balloon in the first place, will get compiled and plugged into impossibly

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,840
complex models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and then archived

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
at the National Climate and Data Center, but that's later.

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,160
Right now, as the Minneapolis meteorologists follow their highly standardized routine,

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,000
one reading catches their eye.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,840
The barometer reads 1,017 millibars—a high-pressure front developing.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,560
For our meteorologists, an Arctic cold front means a few more freezing commutes and balloon

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,560
launches.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,480
For the rest of the US, it might not mean much, or it might present a problem.

25
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,860
That's not a conclusion the data from a single balloon can possibly offer.

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,780
To fulfill their task of telling the public what's to come, the US's National Weather

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,000
Service is going to need far, far more data.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,160
To start, the NWS operates 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars, each dedicating seven

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,360
seconds an hour to emitting quick bursts of energy, then the rest listening for its return

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,720
to interpret what's present in the sky—water or air.

31
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,880
The multi-million dollar installations are spread out across the 50 states, Puerto Rico,

32
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,960
Guam, and uniquely, at one US military base in Okinawa, Japan, and two others in South

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,040
Korea, putting the American National Weather Service in the exceptional position of maintaining

34
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,600
near-complete weather radar coverage over a foreign country.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,920
In the US itself, most metro areas are covered, and the deployment of the system was credited

36
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,220
with increasing average tornado warning times from four to eleven minutes, but still, meaningful

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,960
gaps exist.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,480
While gaps over sparsely populated western states are inconvenient obstacles to accurate

39
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,920
forecasts, the NWS lacks visibility into some slivers of the area known as Tornado Alley—an

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,780
area that relies on these radars to give them the notice needed to get into shelters when

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,660
a tornado does form.

42
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,980
With these NEXRAD radars now out of production and every existing one in use, there is little

43
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,700
opportunity for improvement short of a costly system-wide upgrade, but for the most part,

44
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,940
these 160 radars get the job done and form the foundation of the agency's data collection

45
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
mission.

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,160
But as groundbreakingly effective radar technology is, it's a proxy for measurements actually

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,860
taken in the sky.

48
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,660
This is why the NWS goes through the effort to launch those hundreds of weather balloons

49
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,460
daily, but of course, planes are already up there anyways.

50
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,340
Not only that, but the typical commercial aircraft already has the instruments necessary

51
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,560
to observe atmospheric conditions, so that's why the World Meteorological Organization

52
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,020
set up the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay System.

53
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,580
Forty-three airlines around the world, including Alaska, American, Delta, FedEx, Hawaiian,

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:38,100
Southwest, United, and UPS, have agreed to collect meteorological data in flight and

55
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,500
transmit it to the WMO via satellite or VHF radio.

56
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,900
Meteorologists describe these data as crucial to the accuracy of forecasts, since such frequency

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,500
of atmospheric data cannot be inexpensively obtained through any other means.

58
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,780
In fact, forecasts globally became meaningfully less accurate at the start of the COVID pandemic

59
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,900
due to the loss of much of these data as air travel took a downturn.

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,220
But as important high-altitude data is to predicting what's to come on the ground,

61
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,160
the NWS still needs to know what's happening on the ground right now.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,100
For that, there are 900 automated surface observation systems, again spread out across

63
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,100
the entire country, primarily at airports.

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,460
These include a suite of sensors—temperature, air pressure, humidity, cloud coverage, and

65
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:26,500
more—that automatically report data back to the NWS, and also automatically broadcast

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,060
a radio frequency that pilots can use to gain valuable intel into conditions at their destination

67
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,340
airport.

68
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,140
Some observations, however, cannot be efficiently achieved through automated means.

69
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,260
Some require the human touch.

70
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,100
Precipitation, whether in rain, snow, or something in between, is largely measured by a horde

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,620
of unpaid civilian volunteers donating their time to run 9,000 cooperative observer system

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,460
sites across the country.

73
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,640
Each follows strict protocol to provide the NWS with a daily precipitation measurement

74
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,460
for their local area, which is the primary manner through which forecasters validate

75
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,300
their forecasts—if they see that precipitation is constantly under their prediction in a

76
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,520
given area, they'll adjust, and vice versa.

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,800
These data are also crucial for establishing long-term trends.

78
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,080
It was this program, for example, that observed that average precipitation in the US has grown

79
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,980
7.8% since 1901 due to warming temperatures allowing the atmosphere to hold more water.

80
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:26,420
A similar, even larger program exists called SkyWarn, where 350,000 trained volunteer weather

81
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,380
spotters work with the NWS to act as their eyes on the ground.

82
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,020
These volunteers, many of which are amateur radio enthusiasts that use their skills to

83
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,660
communicate observations regardless of external conditions, track severe weather to both allow

84
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,800
the NWS to alert others of what's to come, and help them validate their weather models

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,300
and forecasts.

86
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,660
But weather is global, and therefore in order to give Americans their forecast, the National

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,900
Weather Service requires data from beyond the American states, territories, and few

88
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,420
foreign radar sites.

89
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,300
That's why the World Meteorological Organization exists.

90
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:02,760
This specialized United Nations agency has myriad responsibilities, but perhaps the most

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:08,100
pivotal centers around ensuring different national forecasters can and do cooperate.

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,720
As of a few years ago, data sharing is mandatory among all WMO members, meaning the US's

93
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,280
NWS gets meteorological data from its foreign counterparts, and vice versa, regardless of

94
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,320
their geopolitical status, thus improving the quality of forecasts for all.

95
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,780
As one of the world's preeminent meteorological organizations, the National Weather Service

96
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:32,680
does, however, have some extra help in gathering data from the rest of the world—satellites.

97
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,360
For decades now, a rotating cast of satellites have held two geostationary positions called

98
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,380
GOES East and GOES West, streaming down a deluge of imagery and meteorological data

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,100
to the agency's ground station on Wallops Island, Virginia.

100
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,100
GOES East and West are currently operated by the GOES 16 and 17 satellites, respectively.

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,420
In addition, the older GOES 15 satellite sits next to GOES 17 to provide redundant coverage,

102
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,260
due to a reliability issue with 17, while GOES 14 sits powered down in a storage orbit

103
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,360
in case an issue with another requires a quick replacement.

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,560
Any gap in coverage from GOES East or West would impact forecast accuracy for hundreds

105
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,380
of millions of Americans.

106
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,940
Meanwhile, GOES 18 was launched in March 2022 and will soon replace GOES 17 to operate as

107
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
GOES West.

108
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:21,420
While these are focused on high-frequency, ongoing coverage of the US and its immediate

109
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:27,040
surroundings, the agency also operates a non-geostationary satellite in a polar orbit to provide less

110
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,860
frequent yet still important data and imagery of the rest of the world.

111
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,920
A secondary function of these GOES satellites is to act as a means of communication for

112
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,000
the most remote NWS observation stations on earth—BUIs.

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,320
Stationed hundreds or thousands of miles offshore, weather BUIs provide a glimpse into areas

114
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,800
of the earth entirely devoid of humans or civilization, but full of weather that could

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
soon impact them.

116
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,680
The network is run by NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, and each transmits near real-time

117
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,600
conditions from the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Pacific, including giving life-saving

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,060
warning of potential impending tsunamis, for example.

119
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,020
More typically, however, they provide the same data land-based stations offer, but in

120
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,240
an area useful for giving coastal regions a heads-up of what's to come.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,300
On the hour, BUIs record temperature and pressure, which is subsequently relayed by the GOES

122
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,760
satellites to the mainland and the supercomputers vacuuming up all possible data to help project

123
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,420
an accurate weather model.

124
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,580
The inclusion of these data may prove a good thing, too, as the same time that this weather

125
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,120
balloon floating over Minnesota is picking up an inbound high-pressure front, this buoy,

126
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,800
number 42019 off the coast of Texas, is reading an above-average air temperature and a below-average

127
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,900
air pressure.

128
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,300
For local forecasters, buoy station 42019, along with other readings, hint at a developing

129
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,360
low-pressure front—some rain might be arriving along the gulf here soon.

130
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,600
But as weather models render, taking into account both an arctic front descending across

131
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,240
the Midwest and a warm, moisture-laden front developing across the gulf, a little rain

132
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,340
might soon be the least of the NWS's worries.

133
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,100
Weather develops at very different scales into very different consequences.

134
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,880
To protect the individual, the thousands, and the millions, the NWS has to predict weather

135
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,640
developments at varying scales.

136
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,300
These predictions of all size and shape all largely emanate from here—the National Centers

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,140
for Environmental Predictions Weather Prediction Center, where data from balloons, buoys, planes,

138
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,800
and satellites the world over pours into various weather models.

139
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,640
While the NWS produces a bevy of different models, they broadly all work the same.

140
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,220
In each, numbers representing observed environmental conditions are plugged into a myriad of equations,

141
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,520
the results of which, once overlaid on a map, offer both an approximate snapshot of the

142
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,040
current atmospheric conditions and a simulated future that predicts how weather patterns

143
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,400
will develop and move.

144
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,180
While the same data, the same math, and the same laws of physics undergird all-weather

145
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,420
modeling, it's a model's resolution and range that differentiates one from the next.

146
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,820
The high-resolution rapid refresh model, for example, with its 2-mile, 3-kilometer resolution,

147
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,040
its real-time visualizations, and its every-hour updating, offers unmatched detail and accuracy

148
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,420
on the development of rapid-moving thunderstorms over the next hour, providing meteorologists

149
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,020
more confidence in offering severe weather warnings.

150
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,960
What it can't do is zoom out temporally or spatially to forecast nationwide developments

151
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,480
even hours into the future—its scope is too focused.

152
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,720
It can tell you to evacuate now, but can't help you decide to bring a rain jacket tomorrow.

153
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,240
To help inform such important decisions between rain jackets or sunscreen, meteorologists

154
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,680
use the North American Mesoscale model, which offers lower resolution than the HRRR, but

155
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,800
identifies patterns that forecast their paths out to 61 hours.

156
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,860
For an even broader picture, the NWS relies on the Global Forecast System, which again

157
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,940
takes a broader view than the NAM, but is able to interpret atmospheric patterns and

158
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,940
weather developments of global scale and to predict out to 10 days in the future—critical

159
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,380
in tracking the long developments of hurricanes, for instance.

160
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,260
Together, these models are incredibly powerful predictive tools.

161
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,940
Running all these models, in turn, requires incredibly powerful computers.

162
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,760
What makes all these models possible are two of the largest supercomputers in the US.

163
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,280
In the wake of the NWS's Global Forecast System failing to identify the dangerous potential

164
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,440
of Hurricane Sandy, Congress greenlit increased funding for NOAA.

165
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,280
The result was the 2016 announcement that NOAA had increased its computing power tenfold

166
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,980
with the introduction of two supercomputers in Reston, Virginia and Orlando, Florida.

167
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,960
The $45 million dollar addition put the 18th fastest computer in the US in the hands of

168
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,540
NOAA, which effectively evened the playing field between the NWS and its European counterpart.

169
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,620
Doubling down on the modernization effort, NOAA again invested in its supercomputers

170
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:51,100
in 2018, adding 60% more storage and more than doubling their computing capacity—moves

171
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,220
which made room for updates and improvements to its models, from the HRRR to the GFS.

172
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:01,080
Importantly, and further justifying such investment, these supercomputers are not only tasked to

173
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,660
run and re-run and re-run atmospheric models all day, every day, they're also tasked

174
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,440
with creating ensemble models—effectively running these same models time and time again

175
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,020
with the parameters slightly changed to reflect the random chance of real-world weather and

176
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,260
therefore give forecasters an idea of the degree of uncertainty for a given prediction.

177
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:24,820
If the forecast holds up despite the random chance thrown in by the ensemble model, it's

178
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,780
more certain, and vice versa.

179
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,040
Together, these various models and the supercomputers that run them non-stop are immensely complex

180
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,440
and extremely expensive.

181
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,080
In the past they have proven incredibly valuable when extreme weather arises, and in the future,

182
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,520
as far-flowing disparate signs of storms quietly develop, they'll prove critical to meteorologists

183
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,160
again.

184
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,800
Hours after the launch of a weather balloon in Minnesota, and a Buies upload off the coast

185
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,800
of Texas on an early March day, they're proving their worth again as GFS forecasts

186
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,460
and then ensemble GFS forecasts are beginning to project with higher confidence that a storm

187
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,900
of significant destructive potential may be brewing.

188
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,720
In the days prior, as millibars dropped over Texas, GFS models had identified the early

189
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,420
stages of what meteorologists call a Gulf Low.

190
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,260
Now with Buies proving such predictions correct, and with the concurrent development of a drop

191
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,820
in cold front, they can now predict its direction and potential severity.

192
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,800
While this Gulf Low seems to be mirroring historical patterns in that it too is primed

193
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,020
to move a mountain of moisture out of the Gulf of Mexico, this particular storm, thanks

194
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:32,140
to the deepening cold front and a U-shaped gulf stream, doesn't look like it will track

195
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,320
along the western edge of the Appalachians, but rather through some of the most densely

196
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,420
populated regions of the American East Coast.

197
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,780
According to GFS forecasting, snow, and a lot of it, is headed northeast.

198
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,620
Of course, forecasts are meaningless by themselves.

199
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,960
To avoid the disaster of an unprepared populace in the firing line of an impending winter

200
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:59,080
storm, plows still in the parking lot, stores without extra stock, kids still in school,

201
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,880
commuters on the road at the wrong time, the National Weather Service has to actually communicate

202
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,440
what's to come.

203
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,520
To achieve this, the agency has 122 weather forecast offices distributed across the 50

204
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,620
states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, each responsible for a dedicated zone of the country.

205
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,380
A couple dozen staff in each work 24-7 to interpret models and issue forecasts for their

206
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,120
surrounding region.

207
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,880
Perhaps most importantly, though, they monitor and issue alerts for the most localized and

208
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,020
often most dangerous threats—severe thunderstorm, flash flood, tornado warnings, and more all

209
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,200
come from local WFOs.

210
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,460
The on-the-ground presence also allows WFOs to tailor their activities to what's necessary

211
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,140
for the people they serve.

212
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:45,620
The Fairbanks, Alaska WFO issues a daily climbing weather forecast for nearby Denali, America's

213
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,700
tallest mountain.

214
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,280
The Dodge City, Kansas WFO, surrounded by hundreds of miles of wheat fields, reports

215
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,680
daily soil temperatures so farmers can optimize their yields.

216
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,360
The Grand Junction, Colorado WFO monitors and reports fire weather conditions, alerting

217
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,260
the wildfire-prone area it's responsible for to the daily risk of one starting and

218
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,260
spreading and therefore informing campfire bans, electric grid shutdowns, and more.

219
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,700
Like most WFOs in fire-prone areas, the Grand Junction office also staffs an incident meteorologist

220
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,500
who is prepared to quickly deploy to the field and embed in a wildfire camp to issue

221
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,220
highly specific forecasts used by aerial firefighting pilots, hotshot crews, and other firefighters

222
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,620
to safely approach and attack the burn.

223
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,220
Finally, the local WFOs are responsible for many of the NWS's on-the-ground operations,

224
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,140
from maintaining Doppler radars and automated surface observation stations, to running the

225
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,900
local NWS twitter account, and far, far more.

226
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:43,560
Ultimately, though, certain weather is just too big or otherworldly to be handled by small,

227
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,900
local WFOs.

228
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,800
For that, there are the national offices.

229
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Some are straightforward.

230
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,560
Rivers, for example, run for hundreds or thousands of miles through countless WFO zones, so there's

231
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,100
an additional system of 13 river forecast centers that split up the lower 48 and Alaska

232
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,460
more or less based on watershed, issuing forecasts for their rivers' flows and, most importantly,

233
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,920
their flood risk.

234
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,400
Perhaps the best known of these national offices is the National Hurricane Center, based in

235
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,560
a bunker-like building in Miami, Florida that's designed and certified to survive

236
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,740
and operate through a category 5 hurricane—the most severe level.

237
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,560
They have the stressful task of predicting the paths and intensities of hurricanes.

238
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,660
If they get it right and people prepare, lives will be saved.

239
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,280
If they miss the forecast, lives will be lost, and they potentially do this all while a hurricane

240
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,000
passes directly over them.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,780
For this reason, the system is structured so the National Weather Prediction Center

242
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,660
in College Park, Maryland is prepared to take over responsibilities in an instant if

243
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,660
the Miami Center goes offline during a storm, while there's also an additional office

244
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:50,420
in Honolulu, Hawaii that staffs up if a comparatively rare Central Pacific hurricane forms.

245
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:54,500
Most uniquely, the National Weather Service is also responsible for forecasting the weather

246
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,860
not only beyond the borders of the US, but beyond the borders of this world.

247
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,940
The NWUS's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado takes in data from the

248
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,780
GOES satellites and terrestrial sensors to report current and forecast future solar radiation

249
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,640
and other space weather.

250
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,900
This isn't just for the novelty, as high solar radiation activity, for example, can

251
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,740
impact the human world.

252
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,120
High frequency radio gets disrupted during solar flares, so commercial aircraft can't

253
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:23,500
fly routes over the poles where they rely on it to talk to air traffic control if the

254
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,480
center is forecasted high levels of radiation—and that's just the very start of issues solar

255
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,780
flares can cause.

256
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,800
Ultimately, though, the totality of the National Weather Service's work, the thousands of

257
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,060
hourly observations from across the world and beyond, the full processing might of two

258
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,460
incredible supercomputers, the collective efforts of thousands of highly trained individuals,

259
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:51,220
all distills down to this—a couple-megabyte XML data feed updated every few minutes.

260
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,780
Generally, people don't get the weather directly from the National Weather Service—they

261
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:59,620
get it from the weather app on their phone, the TV meteorologist, or whatever's most

262
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,340
convenient for them.

263
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,780
Nearly every source of weather information in the US relies on the work of the National

264
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,520
Weather Service, even if it's repackaged and rebranded, so the NWUS works to make these

265
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,700
data abundantly accessible to those that get it to the end user.

266
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:18,160
These XML data feeds are a major source, providing a structured set of current conditions and

267
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,380
forecasts that can be quickly adapted and interpreted by software, and everyone, from

268
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,320
individuals to commercial companies, is legally allowed to use these data since, as a production

269
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,220
of the US government, it is not copyrighted and does not require a license.

270
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,860
Of course, the times when weather information is most important are often also the times

271
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,660
when communications are most difficult—the internet and TV might not be accessible when

272
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,860
it really matters.

273
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,460
Therefore, some 95% of the US population is within range of a NOAA weather radio station,

274
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:53,260
which automatically broadcasts a 24-7 feed of conditions and forecasts.

275
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,900
As a last resort, the National Weather Service also runs the Emergency Managers Weather Information

276
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,220
Network, which uses their GOES satellites to broadcast a data feed down to earth that

277
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,540
uniquely is accessible to anyone with a compatible satellite receiver.

278
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,320
This data feed, available at 1694.1 MHz, includes all the information of conditions and forecasts

279
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,060
for sites across the US, and even includes these visual forecasts, satellite imagery,

280
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,580
and other images for onward use—allowing TV stations, emergency managers, and others

281
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,900
to access this crucial information regardless of the condition of the world around them.

282
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,440
In sum, this is how the National Weather Service tells the East Coast a snowstorm is coming.

283
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,140
All it requires is a couple of satellites and supercomputers, hundreds of radars, observation

284
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,640
stations, buoys, weather balloons, aircraft, and weather forecast offices, and thousands

285
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:47,240
upon thousands of dedicated staff and volunteers.

286
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,280
Rather than do the normal style of ad, since given the fact that you're watching this

287
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,760
it hasn't convinced you yet, this time I'm going to count down the top ten of the many

288
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,360
reasons why you should sign up for the Nebula CuriosityStream bundle deal.

289
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,720
Ten, you can watch this and all of our regular videos without ads or sponsorships.

290
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,680
Nine, you can watch other channels like RealLifeLore, Notchish Bikes, Mustard, and far more also

291
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,360
ad and sponsorship free.

292
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,000
Eight, you can watch all of these different big-budget originals that we've made—we've

293
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,520
put a ton of work into each and I think they're all great.

294
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,760
Seven, you can watch every episode from our new channel, Jetlagged the Game, a full week

295
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,760
early.

296
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,480
Six, you can watch all sorts of originals by other independent creators—I'd recommend

297
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,000
Patrick Williams' Night of the Coconut, which is a feature-length multiverse film

298
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,720
about a genocidal coconut—it's tough to explain but it's so much fun and so well-made

299
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,800
and even includes a cameo by me.

300
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,900
Five, you can discover other fantastic channels, as Nebula only includes a curated group of

301
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,480
high-quality, thoughtful creators.

302
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,200
One that I love in a very different genre is Berm Peak, where Seth brings his audience

303
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,940
along to his unbelievable mountain bike trail-building projects in a way that even people with absolutely

304
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:53,040
no affinity for bikes enjoy.

305
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,160
Four, you can watch the smart, thoughtful content you clearly enjoy without an algorithm

306
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,760
surfacing other clickbaity videos to pull your attention away—it's just you and

307
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,440
the videos, without a platform designed to suck you in for as long as possible.

308
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,360
Three, by watching through Nebula, you'll support all these independent creators and

309
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,440
assure they make a stable income that helps them keep creating everything you love watching.

310
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,280
Two, by signing up through our link, CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you'll get the bundle deal

311
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,520
with CuriosityStream included, meaning you also get access to their fantastic catalog

312
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,840
of top-notch non-fiction shows and documentaries, like Containership XXL, about how the largest

313
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,840
container ship in existence was designed and built.

314
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,600
And number one, all of this costs just $14.79 for a year—that's less than you probably

315
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,160
