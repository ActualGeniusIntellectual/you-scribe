0	5920	It's 4.55am on a March day at the National Weather Service's Twin Cities Forecast Facility
5920	10640	when the morning stillness is broken by the rattle of a garage door opening.
10640	15300	As they do every single morning of every single day, a meteorologist working the station's
15300	19540	public service desk is launching a helium and hydrogen-filled latex balloon connected
19540	23240	to an expendable radio scone by 80 feet of string.
23240	28480	At the very same time, meteorologists from the other 91 NWS radio scone stations across
28480	33800	the US, along with hundreds from around the globe, are launching their own upper-air atmospheric
33800	34800	soundings.
34800	39260	In the next two hours, these balloons will climb up to 100,000 feet, or 300,000 meters
39260	43840	into the atmosphere, drifting as far as 200 miles or 320 kilometers from their launch
43840	48560	point while their payload, about the weight of a grapefruit, relays temperature, air pressure,
48560	50880	and humidity data back to the station.
50880	55480	The technology might be simple, but the readings from various altitudes captured every 12 hours
55480	57720	are simply irreplaceable.
57720	61600	These data, transmitted by radio frequency then scrubbed for errors by the meteorologists
61600	65800	that launched the balloon in the first place, will get compiled and plugged into impossibly
65800	69840	complex models in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and then archived
69840	73360	at the National Climate and Data Center, but that's later.
73360	78160	Right now, as the Minneapolis meteorologists follow their highly standardized routine,
78160	80000	one reading catches their eye.
80000	85840	The barometer reads 1,017 millibars—a high-pressure front developing.
85840	90560	For our meteorologists, an Arctic cold front means a few more freezing commutes and balloon
90560	91560	launches.
91560	95480	For the rest of the US, it might not mean much, or it might present a problem.
95480	99860	That's not a conclusion the data from a single balloon can possibly offer.
99860	103780	To fulfill their task of telling the public what's to come, the US's National Weather
103780	108000	Service is going to need far, far more data.
108000	114160	To start, the NWS operates 160 high-resolution Doppler weather radars, each dedicating seven
114160	118360	seconds an hour to emitting quick bursts of energy, then the rest listening for its return
118360	121720	to interpret what's present in the sky—water or air.
121720	125880	The multi-million dollar installations are spread out across the 50 states, Puerto Rico,
125880	130960	Guam, and uniquely, at one US military base in Okinawa, Japan, and two others in South
130960	135040	Korea, putting the American National Weather Service in the exceptional position of maintaining
135040	138600	near-complete weather radar coverage over a foreign country.
138600	142920	In the US itself, most metro areas are covered, and the deployment of the system was credited
142920	148220	with increasing average tornado warning times from four to eleven minutes, but still, meaningful
148220	149960	gaps exist.
149960	154480	While gaps over sparsely populated western states are inconvenient obstacles to accurate
154480	160920	forecasts, the NWS lacks visibility into some slivers of the area known as Tornado Alley—an
160920	164780	area that relies on these radars to give them the notice needed to get into shelters when
164780	166660	a tornado does form.
166660	170980	With these NEXRAD radars now out of production and every existing one in use, there is little
171020	175700	opportunity for improvement short of a costly system-wide upgrade, but for the most part,
175700	180940	these 160 radars get the job done and form the foundation of the agency's data collection
180940	181940	mission.
181940	187160	But as groundbreakingly effective radar technology is, it's a proxy for measurements actually
187160	188860	taken in the sky.
188860	192660	This is why the NWS goes through the effort to launch those hundreds of weather balloons
192660	197460	daily, but of course, planes are already up there anyways.
197460	201340	Not only that, but the typical commercial aircraft already has the instruments necessary
201340	205560	to observe atmospheric conditions, so that's why the World Meteorological Organization
205560	209020	set up the Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay System.
209020	213580	Forty-three airlines around the world, including Alaska, American, Delta, FedEx, Hawaiian,
213580	218100	Southwest, United, and UPS, have agreed to collect meteorological data in flight and
218100	222500	transmit it to the WMO via satellite or VHF radio.
222500	226900	Meteorologists describe these data as crucial to the accuracy of forecasts, since such frequency
227340	231500	of atmospheric data cannot be inexpensively obtained through any other means.
231500	236780	In fact, forecasts globally became meaningfully less accurate at the start of the COVID pandemic
236780	240900	due to the loss of much of these data as air travel took a downturn.
240900	245220	But as important high-altitude data is to predicting what's to come on the ground,
245220	249160	the NWS still needs to know what's happening on the ground right now.
249160	254100	For that, there are 900 automated surface observation systems, again spread out across
254100	257100	the entire country, primarily at airports.
257100	261460	These include a suite of sensors—temperature, air pressure, humidity, cloud coverage, and
261460	266500	more—that automatically report data back to the NWS, and also automatically broadcast
266500	271060	a radio frequency that pilots can use to gain valuable intel into conditions at their destination
271060	272340	airport.
272340	277140	Some observations, however, cannot be efficiently achieved through automated means.
277140	279260	Some require the human touch.
279260	284100	Precipitation, whether in rain, snow, or something in between, is largely measured by a horde
284100	289620	of unpaid civilian volunteers donating their time to run 9,000 cooperative observer system
289620	291460	sites across the country.
291460	295640	Each follows strict protocol to provide the NWS with a daily precipitation measurement
295640	299460	for their local area, which is the primary manner through which forecasters validate
299460	303300	their forecasts—if they see that precipitation is constantly under their prediction in a
303300	306520	given area, they'll adjust, and vice versa.
306520	309800	These data are also crucial for establishing long-term trends.
309800	314080	It was this program, for example, that observed that average precipitation in the US has grown
314080	319980	7.8% since 1901 due to warming temperatures allowing the atmosphere to hold more water.
319980	326420	A similar, even larger program exists called SkyWarn, where 350,000 trained volunteer weather
326420	330380	spotters work with the NWS to act as their eyes on the ground.
330380	334020	These volunteers, many of which are amateur radio enthusiasts that use their skills to
334020	338660	communicate observations regardless of external conditions, track severe weather to both allow
338660	342800	the NWS to alert others of what's to come, and help them validate their weather models
342800	344300	and forecasts.
344300	348660	But weather is global, and therefore in order to give Americans their forecast, the National
348660	352900	Weather Service requires data from beyond the American states, territories, and few
352900	354420	foreign radar sites.
354420	358300	That's why the World Meteorological Organization exists.
358300	362760	This specialized United Nations agency has myriad responsibilities, but perhaps the most
362760	368100	pivotal centers around ensuring different national forecasters can and do cooperate.
368120	373720	As of a few years ago, data sharing is mandatory among all WMO members, meaning the US's
373720	378280	NWS gets meteorological data from its foreign counterparts, and vice versa, regardless of
378280	382320	their geopolitical status, thus improving the quality of forecasts for all.
382320	386780	As one of the world's preeminent meteorological organizations, the National Weather Service
386780	392680	does, however, have some extra help in gathering data from the rest of the world—satellites.
392680	397360	For decades now, a rotating cast of satellites have held two geostationary positions called
397360	402380	GOES East and GOES West, streaming down a deluge of imagery and meteorological data
402380	406100	to the agency's ground station on Wallops Island, Virginia.
406100	411100	GOES East and West are currently operated by the GOES 16 and 17 satellites, respectively.
411100	416420	In addition, the older GOES 15 satellite sits next to GOES 17 to provide redundant coverage,
416420	421260	due to a reliability issue with 17, while GOES 14 sits powered down in a storage orbit
421260	424360	in case an issue with another requires a quick replacement.
424360	428560	Any gap in coverage from GOES East or West would impact forecast accuracy for hundreds
428560	430380	of millions of Americans.
430380	435940	Meanwhile, GOES 18 was launched in March 2022 and will soon replace GOES 17 to operate as
435940	436940	GOES West.
436940	441420	While these are focused on high-frequency, ongoing coverage of the US and its immediate
441420	447040	surroundings, the agency also operates a non-geostationary satellite in a polar orbit to provide less
447040	450860	frequent yet still important data and imagery of the rest of the world.
450860	454920	A secondary function of these GOES satellites is to act as a means of communication for
454920	460000	the most remote NWS observation stations on earth—BUIs.
460000	464320	Stationed hundreds or thousands of miles offshore, weather BUIs provide a glimpse into areas
464320	468800	of the earth entirely devoid of humans or civilization, but full of weather that could
468800	470400	soon impact them.
470400	474680	The network is run by NOAA's National Data Buoy Center, and each transmits near real-time
474680	479600	conditions from the Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, and Pacific, including giving life-saving
479600	483060	warning of potential impending tsunamis, for example.
483060	487020	More typically, however, they provide the same data land-based stations offer, but in
487020	491240	an area useful for giving coastal regions a heads-up of what's to come.
491240	495300	On the hour, BUIs record temperature and pressure, which is subsequently relayed by the GOES
495300	499760	satellites to the mainland and the supercomputers vacuuming up all possible data to help project
499760	501420	an accurate weather model.
501420	505580	The inclusion of these data may prove a good thing, too, as the same time that this weather
505580	510120	balloon floating over Minnesota is picking up an inbound high-pressure front, this buoy,
510120	515800	number 42019 off the coast of Texas, is reading an above-average air temperature and a below-average
515800	516900	air pressure.
516900	522300	For local forecasters, buoy station 42019, along with other readings, hint at a developing
522300	526360	low-pressure front—some rain might be arriving along the gulf here soon.
526360	530600	But as weather models render, taking into account both an arctic front descending across
530600	535240	the Midwest and a warm, moisture-laden front developing across the gulf, a little rain
535240	539340	might soon be the least of the NWS's worries.
539340	544100	Weather develops at very different scales into very different consequences.
544100	548880	To protect the individual, the thousands, and the millions, the NWS has to predict weather
548880	551640	developments at varying scales.
551640	556300	These predictions of all size and shape all largely emanate from here—the National Centers
556300	561140	for Environmental Predictions Weather Prediction Center, where data from balloons, buoys, planes,
561140	564800	and satellites the world over pours into various weather models.
564800	570640	While the NWS produces a bevy of different models, they broadly all work the same.
570640	576220	In each, numbers representing observed environmental conditions are plugged into a myriad of equations,
576220	580520	the results of which, once overlaid on a map, offer both an approximate snapshot of the
580520	585040	current atmospheric conditions and a simulated future that predicts how weather patterns
585040	586400	will develop and move.
586740	591180	While the same data, the same math, and the same laws of physics undergird all-weather
591180	596420	modeling, it's a model's resolution and range that differentiates one from the next.
596420	601820	The high-resolution rapid refresh model, for example, with its 2-mile, 3-kilometer resolution,
601820	607040	its real-time visualizations, and its every-hour updating, offers unmatched detail and accuracy
607040	611420	on the development of rapid-moving thunderstorms over the next hour, providing meteorologists
611420	614020	more confidence in offering severe weather warnings.
614560	618960	What it can't do is zoom out temporally or spatially to forecast nationwide developments
618960	622480	even hours into the future—its scope is too focused.
622480	627720	It can tell you to evacuate now, but can't help you decide to bring a rain jacket tomorrow.
627720	632240	To help inform such important decisions between rain jackets or sunscreen, meteorologists
632240	637680	use the North American Mesoscale model, which offers lower resolution than the HRRR, but
637680	641800	identifies patterns that forecast their paths out to 61 hours.
641800	646860	For an even broader picture, the NWS relies on the Global Forecast System, which again
646860	650940	takes a broader view than the NAM, but is able to interpret atmospheric patterns and
650940	655940	weather developments of global scale and to predict out to 10 days in the future—critical
655940	659380	in tracking the long developments of hurricanes, for instance.
659380	663260	Together, these models are incredibly powerful predictive tools.
663260	667940	Running all these models, in turn, requires incredibly powerful computers.
667960	672760	What makes all these models possible are two of the largest supercomputers in the US.
672760	677280	In the wake of the NWS's Global Forecast System failing to identify the dangerous potential
677280	681440	of Hurricane Sandy, Congress greenlit increased funding for NOAA.
681440	686280	The result was the 2016 announcement that NOAA had increased its computing power tenfold
686280	690980	with the introduction of two supercomputers in Reston, Virginia and Orlando, Florida.
690980	695960	The $45 million dollar addition put the 18th fastest computer in the US in the hands of
695960	701540	NOAA, which effectively evened the playing field between the NWS and its European counterpart.
701540	705620	Doubling down on the modernization effort, NOAA again invested in its supercomputers
705620	711100	in 2018, adding 60% more storage and more than doubling their computing capacity—moves
711100	716220	which made room for updates and improvements to its models, from the HRRR to the GFS.
716220	721080	Importantly, and further justifying such investment, these supercomputers are not only tasked to
721080	726660	run and re-run and re-run atmospheric models all day, every day, they're also tasked
726660	731440	with creating ensemble models—effectively running these same models time and time again
731440	736020	with the parameters slightly changed to reflect the random chance of real-world weather and
736020	740260	therefore give forecasters an idea of the degree of uncertainty for a given prediction.
740260	744820	If the forecast holds up despite the random chance thrown in by the ensemble model, it's
744820	746780	more certain, and vice versa.
746800	752040	Together, these various models and the supercomputers that run them non-stop are immensely complex
752040	753440	and extremely expensive.
753440	759080	In the past they have proven incredibly valuable when extreme weather arises, and in the future,
759080	764520	as far-flowing disparate signs of storms quietly develop, they'll prove critical to meteorologists
764520	766160	again.
766160	769800	Hours after the launch of a weather balloon in Minnesota, and a Buies upload off the coast
769800	774800	of Texas on an early March day, they're proving their worth again as GFS forecasts
774820	779460	and then ensemble GFS forecasts are beginning to project with higher confidence that a storm
779460	782900	of significant destructive potential may be brewing.
782900	787720	In the days prior, as millibars dropped over Texas, GFS models had identified the early
787720	791420	stages of what meteorologists call a Gulf Low.
791420	795260	Now with Buies proving such predictions correct, and with the concurrent development of a drop
795260	799820	in cold front, they can now predict its direction and potential severity.
799820	803800	While this Gulf Low seems to be mirroring historical patterns in that it too is primed
803820	808020	to move a mountain of moisture out of the Gulf of Mexico, this particular storm, thanks
808020	812140	to the deepening cold front and a U-shaped gulf stream, doesn't look like it will track
812140	816320	along the western edge of the Appalachians, but rather through some of the most densely
816320	819420	populated regions of the American East Coast.
819420	825780	According to GFS forecasting, snow, and a lot of it, is headed northeast.
825780	829620	Of course, forecasts are meaningless by themselves.
829620	833960	To avoid the disaster of an unprepared populace in the firing line of an impending winter
833960	839080	storm, plows still in the parking lot, stores without extra stock, kids still in school,
839080	843880	commuters on the road at the wrong time, the National Weather Service has to actually communicate
843880	845440	what's to come.
845440	851520	To achieve this, the agency has 122 weather forecast offices distributed across the 50
851520	856620	states, Puerto Rico, and Guam, each responsible for a dedicated zone of the country.
856620	861380	A couple dozen staff in each work 24-7 to interpret models and issue forecasts for their
861380	863120	surrounding region.
863120	866880	Perhaps most importantly, though, they monitor and issue alerts for the most localized and
866880	872020	often most dangerous threats—severe thunderstorm, flash flood, tornado warnings, and more all
872020	874200	come from local WFOs.
874200	878460	The on-the-ground presence also allows WFOs to tailor their activities to what's necessary
878460	880140	for the people they serve.
880140	885620	The Fairbanks, Alaska WFO issues a daily climbing weather forecast for nearby Denali, America's
885620	886700	tallest mountain.
886700	891280	The Dodge City, Kansas WFO, surrounded by hundreds of miles of wheat fields, reports
891280	894680	daily soil temperatures so farmers can optimize their yields.
894680	899360	The Grand Junction, Colorado WFO monitors and reports fire weather conditions, alerting
899360	903260	the wildfire-prone area it's responsible for to the daily risk of one starting and
903260	908260	spreading and therefore informing campfire bans, electric grid shutdowns, and more.
908260	913700	Like most WFOs in fire-prone areas, the Grand Junction office also staffs an incident meteorologist
913700	917500	who is prepared to quickly deploy to the field and embed in a wildfire camp to issue
917500	922220	highly specific forecasts used by aerial firefighting pilots, hotshot crews, and other firefighters
922220	924620	to safely approach and attack the burn.
924620	930220	Finally, the local WFOs are responsible for many of the NWS's on-the-ground operations,
930220	934140	from maintaining Doppler radars and automated surface observation stations, to running the
934140	937900	local NWS twitter account, and far, far more.
937900	943560	Ultimately, though, certain weather is just too big or otherworldly to be handled by small,
943560	944900	local WFOs.
944900	947800	For that, there are the national offices.
947800	948800	Some are straightforward.
948800	954560	Rivers, for example, run for hundreds or thousands of miles through countless WFO zones, so there's
954560	959100	an additional system of 13 river forecast centers that split up the lower 48 and Alaska
959100	964460	more or less based on watershed, issuing forecasts for their rivers' flows and, most importantly,
964460	965920	their flood risk.
965920	970400	Perhaps the best known of these national offices is the National Hurricane Center, based in
970400	974560	a bunker-like building in Miami, Florida that's designed and certified to survive
974560	978740	and operate through a category 5 hurricane—the most severe level.
978740	983560	They have the stressful task of predicting the paths and intensities of hurricanes.
983560	986660	If they get it right and people prepare, lives will be saved.
986660	991280	If they miss the forecast, lives will be lost, and they potentially do this all while a hurricane
991280	993000	passes directly over them.
993000	996780	For this reason, the system is structured so the National Weather Prediction Center
996780	1000660	in College Park, Maryland is prepared to take over responsibilities in an instant if
1000660	1004660	the Miami Center goes offline during a storm, while there's also an additional office
1004660	1010420	in Honolulu, Hawaii that staffs up if a comparatively rare Central Pacific hurricane forms.
1010420	1014500	Most uniquely, the National Weather Service is also responsible for forecasting the weather
1014500	1018860	not only beyond the borders of the US, but beyond the borders of this world.
1018860	1022940	The NWUS's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado takes in data from the
1022940	1027780	GOES satellites and terrestrial sensors to report current and forecast future solar radiation
1027780	1029640	and other space weather.
1029640	1033900	This isn't just for the novelty, as high solar radiation activity, for example, can
1033900	1035740	impact the human world.
1035740	1040120	High frequency radio gets disrupted during solar flares, so commercial aircraft can't
1040120	1043500	fly routes over the poles where they rely on it to talk to air traffic control if the
1043500	1048480	center is forecasted high levels of radiation—and that's just the very start of issues solar
1048480	1049780	flares can cause.
1050300	1054800	Ultimately, though, the totality of the National Weather Service's work, the thousands of
1054800	1059060	hourly observations from across the world and beyond, the full processing might of two
1059060	1064460	incredible supercomputers, the collective efforts of thousands of highly trained individuals,
1064460	1071220	all distills down to this—a couple-megabyte XML data feed updated every few minutes.
1071220	1075780	Generally, people don't get the weather directly from the National Weather Service—they
1075780	1079620	get it from the weather app on their phone, the TV meteorologist, or whatever's most
1079620	1081340	convenient for them.
1081340	1084780	Nearly every source of weather information in the US relies on the work of the National
1084780	1089520	Weather Service, even if it's repackaged and rebranded, so the NWUS works to make these
1089520	1093700	data abundantly accessible to those that get it to the end user.
1093700	1098160	These XML data feeds are a major source, providing a structured set of current conditions and
1098160	1102380	forecasts that can be quickly adapted and interpreted by software, and everyone, from
1102380	1107320	individuals to commercial companies, is legally allowed to use these data since, as a production
1107320	1112220	of the US government, it is not copyrighted and does not require a license.
1112220	1116860	Of course, the times when weather information is most important are often also the times
1116860	1121660	when communications are most difficult—the internet and TV might not be accessible when
1121660	1122860	it really matters.
1122860	1128460	Therefore, some 95% of the US population is within range of a NOAA weather radio station,
1128460	1133260	which automatically broadcasts a 24-7 feed of conditions and forecasts.
1133260	1137900	As a last resort, the National Weather Service also runs the Emergency Managers Weather Information
1137900	1142220	Network, which uses their GOES satellites to broadcast a data feed down to earth that
1142220	1146540	uniquely is accessible to anyone with a compatible satellite receiver.
1146540	1152320	This data feed, available at 1694.1 MHz, includes all the information of conditions and forecasts
1152320	1157060	for sites across the US, and even includes these visual forecasts, satellite imagery,
1157060	1161580	and other images for onward use—allowing TV stations, emergency managers, and others
1161580	1166900	to access this crucial information regardless of the condition of the world around them.
1166900	1172440	In sum, this is how the National Weather Service tells the East Coast a snowstorm is coming.
1172440	1177140	All it requires is a couple of satellites and supercomputers, hundreds of radars, observation
1177140	1181640	stations, buoys, weather balloons, aircraft, and weather forecast offices, and thousands
1181640	1187240	upon thousands of dedicated staff and volunteers.
1187240	1190280	Rather than do the normal style of ad, since given the fact that you're watching this
1190280	1194760	it hasn't convinced you yet, this time I'm going to count down the top ten of the many
1194760	1198360	reasons why you should sign up for the Nebula CuriosityStream bundle deal.
1198360	1202720	Ten, you can watch this and all of our regular videos without ads or sponsorships.
1202720	1207680	Nine, you can watch other channels like RealLifeLore, Notchish Bikes, Mustard, and far more also
1207680	1209360	ad and sponsorship free.
1209360	1213000	Eight, you can watch all of these different big-budget originals that we've made—we've
1213000	1215520	put a ton of work into each and I think they're all great.
1215520	1219760	Seven, you can watch every episode from our new channel, Jetlagged the Game, a full week
1219760	1220760	early.
1220760	1224480	Six, you can watch all sorts of originals by other independent creators—I'd recommend
1224480	1228000	Patrick Williams' Night of the Coconut, which is a feature-length multiverse film
1228000	1232720	about a genocidal coconut—it's tough to explain but it's so much fun and so well-made
1232720	1234800	and even includes a cameo by me.
1234800	1239900	Five, you can discover other fantastic channels, as Nebula only includes a curated group of
1239900	1242480	high-quality, thoughtful creators.
1242480	1246200	One that I love in a very different genre is Berm Peak, where Seth brings his audience
1246200	1250940	along to his unbelievable mountain bike trail-building projects in a way that even people with absolutely
1250940	1253040	no affinity for bikes enjoy.
1253040	1257160	Four, you can watch the smart, thoughtful content you clearly enjoy without an algorithm
1257160	1260760	surfacing other clickbaity videos to pull your attention away—it's just you and
1260760	1264440	the videos, without a platform designed to suck you in for as long as possible.
1264440	1268360	Three, by watching through Nebula, you'll support all these independent creators and
1268360	1272440	assure they make a stable income that helps them keep creating everything you love watching.

1289840	1296600	And number one, all of this costs just $14.79 for a year—that's less than you probably
