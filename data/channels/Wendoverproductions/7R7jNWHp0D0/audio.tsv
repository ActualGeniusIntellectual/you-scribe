0	5500	Welcome back to the news you missed in 2020 from every country in the world.
5500	9960	If you haven't yet seen part one, make sure you go and watch that first—unless, of course,
9960	13600	you only care about the small countries, because we'll start with one with a rather petite
13600	17780	population of just eight and a half million.
17780	21840	An eight-year-old boy who tried to use spirit money—fake bills used in China as spiritual
21840	26360	offerings—at a grocery store in Switzerland didn't get Monopoly's go-to-jail card,
26360	29920	but he did get a mugshot and now has a police record.
29920	34080	The heavy-handed punishment for using counterfeit money surprised residents because of the boy's
34080	38400	age and presumed naivete, and caused some embarrassment for the country, which discussed
38400	40840	the case openly in Parliament.
40840	47440	Chevron's $4 billion acquisition of Texas-based Noble Energy was an American transaction,
47440	49000	but was rooted in Israel.
49000	53880	That's because Noble Energy has built a large natural gas business in and around Israeli
53880	58440	waters, and the purchase essentially opens up the country to energy development—a nation
58440	62320	that had remained virtually untouched to such activities in order to maintain political
62320	65420	stability with Arab oil-producing countries.
65420	70480	Not only does the deal unlock the potential for a brand new resource economy, but it demonstrates
70480	75800	that the Persian Gulf may now be more accepting of Israeli business.
75800	80360	Togo became the first country in Africa to eliminate sleeping sickness—a sometimes
80360	86400	fatal parasitic infection transmitted by flies, found primarily in rural areas in 36 African
86400	87400	countries.
87400	92000	After more than two decades of dedicated public health measures, the West African country
92000	97640	eliminated the illness, which causes fever, aches, and, most commonly, disrupts a person's
97640	98640	sleep.
98640	102340	The good news is that cases are also dropping throughout Africa, and the number of people
102340	107260	dying has dropped 90% since the early 90s, when the annual death toll reached a peak
107260	109420	of 34,000.
109420	113340	Some more good news out of Africa is that girls and young women who are pregnant in
113340	116880	Sierra Leone are no longer banned from attending school.
116880	121480	Previously, once pregnant, young women were not allowed to finish school or take their
121480	126060	exams, but this decision is a victory for feminism in the country, and will allow tens
126060	129720	of thousands of young women to potentially complete their education and provide them
129720	132660	with more opportunity in life.
132660	137960	The crater of a meteorite that hit Earth 800,000 years ago, blasting glass particles known
137960	143720	as tektites to over 10% of the planet, has gone unfound… until now.
143720	148260	Researchers think they have located the impact crater, stretching 11 miles or 17 kilometers
148260	153160	long by 8 miles or 13 kilometers wide and filled with about 300 feet or 90 meters of
153160	156040	rock, on a plateau in Laos.
156040	160760	Though a crater like this should have presented itself through erosion over eons, this elusive
160760	166240	hole was covered by more than 1,000 feet or 300 meters of lava flow, and was only discovered
166240	170280	on a hillside after it was carved out to pave a road.
170280	175000	Brazilian World Cup football star Ronaldinho spent the past six months in a Paraguayan
175000	179460	jail and house arrest for entering the country in March on an illegal passport.
179460	183760	The star player spent more than a month behind bars, and was then transported to a luxury
183760	188420	hotel and held there for another four months, while his legal troubles were sorted out between
188420	189480	the governments.
189480	192060	He says he didn't know the passport was fake.
192060	196160	During the latter part, he reportedly had parties in San Cariocchi, leading people to
196160	199700	wonder if prison is really that bad.
199700	204740	Speaking of fake passports and punishment, Raya, a three-month-old Chihuahua, was facing
204740	209460	euthanasia for traveling from her home country of Bulgaria to Norway, where she'd been
209460	215300	adopted, on a falsified passport, until action star Jean-Claude Van Damme stepped in, and
215300	217020	you can't make this stuff up.
217020	221340	Bulgaria initially refused to take the dog back, until Van Damme took to social media,
221340	227180	and the country capitulated, eventually repatriating her and putting her up for adoption again.
227340	230580	Remember that story about Israel, natural gas, and the Mediterranean Sea?
230580	234140	We're back to it, but this time with Lebanon involved.
234140	238100	The two countries started mediation for the first time in 30 years over part of the sea
238100	241360	because of their dual interest in energy development.
241360	247300	Both say that a 330-square-mile, 850-square-kilometer area of the sea is part of their exclusive
247300	248580	economic zone.
248580	253420	The two have been essentially at a standstill for decades, and even though they had to communicate
253420	258420	through mediators from the United States, their meeting marked a historic moment.
258420	262780	More mediation in the Middle East actually took place in the United Nations in Geneva,
262780	267540	but it led to a ceasefire between the two main warring factions in Africa's Libya.
267540	271980	The two sides have been engaged in a bloody battle for years, and this newest peace attempt
271980	275980	brings some hope to both the country and to nearby nations that have previously tried
275980	279080	to intervene, such as Russia and Turkey.
279080	283740	As Nicaragua continues to develop its natural resources, reports show that it may be doing
283740	286800	it at the cost of indigenous people's lives.
286800	291060	The government is actively promoting illegal land grabs for timber and mining companies,
291060	294840	and there have been reports that more than 40 native people have been killed, though
294840	296640	the police refuse to investigate.
296640	301000	It's all the more complicated by the fact that President Daniel Ortega has family ties
301000	305660	to one of the most active timber companies working in the protected area.
305660	310960	Up the coast, Guatemala offered El Salvador the opportunity to build a port on its lands
310960	316300	and waters, giving Atlantic Ocean access to El Salvador, whose coastline is only on the
316300	317300	Pacific.
317300	321940	In its initial phases, the port will likely be constructed through a private-public partnership
321940	327500	and infrastructure, such as hotels and warehouses, would be built around the port as well, bringing
327500	331620	a significant El Salvadorian presence to its neighboring country.
331620	334020	Alright, try to keep up with this one.
334020	339340	In Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia's only democracy, the President resigned after a week in hiding,
339340	341060	following a tumultuous election.
341060	346220	A few hours before his announcement, President Genbakov said he would not step down amid
346220	351300	the disputed election, but then he did and it left some wondering if his quick about-face
351300	355100	was triggered by threats of violence from a criminal-backed group.
355100	360280	The new leader is a former kidnapper who was sprung from jail by anti-government protesters
360280	364800	at the same time as Genbakov's resignation, raising many eyebrows.
364800	370160	Nearby, the President of Turkmenistan is widely known for his obsession with a breed of dog
370160	371520	called the Alibi.
371520	377240	So, it didn't come as a surprise that he erected a 19-foot, 6-meter-old statue of the
377240	381280	shepherd-like canine in a traffic circle in the country's capital.
381280	385920	Turkmenistan is also known to have one of the world's more repressive governments,
385920	389460	and doesn't even allow human rights organizations into the country.
389460	394180	That creates a definite disconnect in terms of humanizing animals, but treating humans
394180	396580	inhumanely.
396580	401060	Investors and entrepreneurs have keyed in on a new use for Australia's desolate and
401060	406060	unforgiving outback—turn it into a solar farm large enough to power the country of
406060	407060	Singapore.
407060	412700	Sun Cable has announced a $90 billion, 10 gigawatt, 30,000-acre solar farm that will
412700	418460	send about two-thirds of the energy it produces north through undersea high-voltage cables.
418460	424060	If all goes right, the lights of Singapore could be solar-powered by 2027.
424060	428620	In another part of the global movement to cleaner energy, Denmark, the European Union's
428620	433260	largest oil producer, announced it would end all oil and gas exploration in the North Sea
433260	437300	as part of its commitment to phase out fossil fuel extraction by 2050.
437300	443380	Its existing 55 platforms, spread across 20 oil and gas fields, will continue operations,
443380	447620	but the decision to stop looking for more sends a powerful message to the world about
447620	452300	the future of energy, and this country's goal is to be a green leader.
452300	456900	Some of the world may be saying goodbye to fossil fuels, but an animal that oddly turns
456900	461660	out to like gas-powered vehicles, or at least their sounds, is a monkey.
461660	467180	A zoo in Finland gave their white-faced saki monkeys a choice between the sounds of traffic,
467180	472100	the jungle, zen, or dance music, and the primates overwhelmingly preferred honking cars and
472100	476500	screeching tires over the mimicry of their natural habitat.
476500	480960	When Slovakian President Zuzana Kaputova learned that Chinese telecom giant Huawei
480960	485220	was the sponsor for a defense conference at which she was slated to speak, she quickly
485220	487860	pressed end call and cancelled her talk.
487860	492260	She cited security risks, along with following her basic principles, since Huawei has been
492260	494100	accused of foreign interference.
494100	499020	Huawei eventually backed out of the conference, and Kaputova ended up taking the stage, but
499020	502460	the message was heard loud and clear.
502460	507060	The World Wildlife Foundation has been working for more than a decade to set up a national
507060	512020	park and nature reserve in the Republic of the Congo, however, this year, the European
512020	516620	Union pulled their funding upon reports that the anti-poaching guards patrolling the proposed
516620	521540	park have been engaging in physical violence against the indigenous people of the area,
521540	525060	and are restricting them from moving around on their own land.
525060	529260	The World Wildlife Foundation's application for EU funding specifically stated that the
529260	533700	indigenous people of the area were for the project, but given that that either no longer
533700	539200	or was never true, it's unclear whether this project will move forward.
539200	544220	Only three countries still allow commercial whaling, and Norway is one of them.
544220	548740	Typically, the Scandinavian country sends most of its whale meat to Japan, where demand
548740	553700	is high, but Norwegians are opting to consume more of the meat for the first time in years,
553700	557980	which is probably due to the growing movement against traditionally processed meat in favor
557980	563300	of locally sourced products, like the mink whales they hunt in their own waters.
563300	566100	Close your eyes if you don't want to see something bizarre.
566100	570740	It's the wrinkle-faced bat native to Costa Rica.
570740	574720	But of course, what one sees as ugly, others find sexy?
574720	579720	New research this year found that these elusive jungle dwellers mate in an interesting way.
579720	584500	The males congregate in big groups, perform a routine, and fold some of the extra skin
584500	591020	around their face up like a neck gaiter to seduce the females—and it seems to work.
591020	595300	Three Palestinian peace activists who held a Zoom call with Israelis that included more
595300	601220	than 200 participants and viewers were charged with quote, weakening revolutionary spirit.
601220	605580	Their goal was part of a bridge-building initiative called Skype with Your Enemy, but according
605580	610440	to Palestinian officials, communication with Israel is considered a quote, normalization
610440	612240	activity and punishable.
612240	617360	The three could face years in prison and hard labor sentences.
617360	622120	The Arab world's longest-serving ruler, the Sultan of Oman, died this year at the
622120	624080	age of 79.
624080	628860	Since he had no children, his cousin was chosen to replace him, ending years of speculation
628860	633320	on which of the more than 80 potential successors would gain the spot.
633320	638120	Upon his passing, the Sultan was recognized for his steadfast, diplomatic reign by other
638120	639640	world leaders.
639640	644060	This is a seemingly peaceful story about a leadership change, amid a flurry of headlines
644060	646560	this year that were quite the opposite.
646560	651260	It's easier to get to Liberia from France, as well as other western destinations, now
651260	656320	that Air France resumed its flight from Paris to Monrovia after a nine-year hiatus.
656320	661200	The direct flight debuted on an Airbus A350, which landed at a newly refurbished Robert
661200	663660	International Airport in Liberia.
663660	667240	Officials boasted about the newly improved connections between the United States, United
667240	672060	Kingdom, India, and China with the return of this flight, and, naturally, the strengthened
672060	675120	ties between Liberia and France.
675120	679880	When visitors to the North Pole buried a time capsule there in 2018, they thought it would
679880	684820	be 40 years until it was discovered, but, because of climate change and the fast-melting
684820	687920	Arctic, the artifacts were found much sooner.
687920	693720	They washed up on the shores of Ireland this year, some 2,300 miles or 3,700 kilometers
693720	694720	away.
694720	698440	That's obviously another bad sign for the Arctic, which some scientists say will be
698440	702520	ice-free by the summer of 2035.
702520	707780	Last year, a volcano on New Zealand's White Island erupted and killed 22 people, including
707780	711200	children and seniors, who were there with tour groups.
711200	715880	Now, 13 parties have been charged in their deaths, with lawsuits claiming negligence
715880	719160	for allowing people to visit the site of an active volcano.
719160	723700	A family owns the island, and tours were run by a small group of operators, but the island
723700	726980	has been closed to visitors ever since.
726980	731620	A Sudanese militia leader who had been on the run for 13 years was arrested in a remote
731620	736340	corner of the Central African Republic, near the border with Sudan, which is where he allegedly
736340	741080	carried out crimes against humanity, including mass campaigns of murder, rape, and looting
741080	747100	in the early 2000s, which partially contributed to a humanitarian crisis in which 300,000
747100	750640	people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.
750640	754920	His arrest and subsequent trial at The Hague will potentially bring justice to many who
754920	757420	have suffered in Darfur.
757420	762520	For several months, Mauritania banned Senegal from fishing in its waters because of illegal,
762520	768320	unreported, and unregulated fishing, which they say cost their country up to $300 million
768320	769440	in lost revenue.
769440	774640	Now, under the new agreement, Senegal will pay Mauritania for the actual fish it catches,
774640	778040	which means no more punitive fines for the country instead.
778040	782240	This seems like a win-win for the two West African countries, and demonstrates some progress
782240	786540	towards countries all happily sharing the same pond.
786540	791480	In 2016, the Panama Papers exposed how some of the world's most prominent politicians,
791480	795540	business leaders, and celebrities set up offshore bank accounts to conceal their wealth and
795540	798240	avoid taxes in the Central American country.
798240	801500	So, of course, Netflix made a movie about it.
801500	807280	But now, the law firm behind the 11.5 million documents is not happy about their portrayal
807280	811960	as quote, ruthless, uncaring, and unethical lawyers, so they're doing the most lawyer
811960	814760	thing possible and suing Netflix.
814760	820280	Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca are claiming defamation and asks Netflix to cease streaming
820280	824680	The Laundromat, though it's already been screened to crowds at European film festivals.
824680	829840	Readers, writers, and free speech advocates are rejoicing now that officials in Kuwait
829840	834540	disbanded a committee that banned more than 5,000 books over seven years.
834540	838900	The country's Ministry of Information will no longer have the control to censor titles
838900	843700	like Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and 100 Years of Solitude by Gabrielle
843700	845500	Garcia Marquez.
845500	850600	But besides banning book imports, the committee also had a say over every title that was published
850600	851660	in the country.
851660	855420	Now they don't, and that means the words should flow more freely.
855420	859660	Here's a tip—if you're German but wanted in the United States for building software
859660	863900	that tricks automobile emissions inspectors, then don't cross from Germany, where you're
863900	866580	elected, into Croatia, where you're not.
866580	870800	Apparently, former Volkswagen executive Alex Eiser didn't get the memo that only his
870800	873900	native country doesn't extradite its own citizens.
873900	877500	He was arrested when crossing the border in June, and will likely be charged in the United
877500	881380	States since America and Croatia signed an extradition treaty last year.
881380	885520	He's at the center of the emissions scandal in which the German auto manufacturer tried
885520	890220	to evade US Clean Air Act laws by tricking the system, and his arrest shows that the
890220	894380	United States isn't finished with its car chase yet.
894380	899460	Moldova is veering away from its Putin-leaning ways, at least temporarily, with its election
899460	905580	of Maia Sandu, a pro-Western, Harvard-educated former prime minister, and its ouster of incumbent
905580	908500	pro-Russian president Igor Dodonu.
908500	912940	Besides favoring European ties, Sandu is also the country's first woman president.
912940	916820	She ran on an anti-corruption platform and championed embracing the country's Romanian
916820	921700	roots—as 75 of the countries speaks Romanian—over its ties to Russia.
921700	926160	Tiny Moldova is sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, which have also leaned more Russian
926160	931060	in recent years, and the results demonstrate this region's increased shift away from
931060	932060	Russia.
932060	935980	If you're tired of hearing about Georgia, the US state, you can opt to move to the Eastern
935980	940040	European country of the same name to escape the 24-7 news.
940040	944660	The nation recently announced a visa-free entry program, called Remotely from Georgia,
944660	948400	that grants year-long stays to nationals from 95 countries.
948400	952700	There are some caveats—transplants must earn at least $2,000 per month and have health
952700	957100	insurance—meaning the country is looking for a certain type of more permanent visitor—one
957100	960840	that has money and can contribute to its faltering economy.
960840	965100	The European Union is being held accountable for the way it funds projects in Africa, thanks
965100	967700	to a group of air-trains in the Netherlands.
967700	972080	They allege that the EU is paying for forced labor by funding heavy construction equipment
972080	976480	to open and pave a road that connects the Ethiopia-Eritrea border with the Eritrean
976480	978020	port of Massawa.
978020	981200	That equipment is apparently being run by conscripts.
981200	986420	The project is part of a $6 billion injection from the EU into Africa as a way to curb migration
986420	992400	from south to north, but this case shows that more oversight is needed in the process.
992400	996640	Another immigration story centers around a steady stream of Argentinians relocating to
996640	1000200	Uruguay—a move that the latter is quite happy about.
1000200	1004040	Uruguay enticed residents from its southern neighbor by lowering the minimum value of
1004040	1011000	property required for tax residency from $1.7 million to $380,000, and by offering a 10-year
1011000	1012200	tax holiday.
1012200	1017620	That, in turn, has led close to 20,000 people to flock north this year—a number equivalent
1017620	1023560	to about 0.6% of Uruguay's population of 3.5 million—meaning the great pandemic migration
1023560	1025680	continues.
1025680	1030340	Also signaling that Bosnia-Herzegovina is next on the luxury destination list, Saudi
1030340	1035680	developer Dar Al Arkan announced this year it would build a 5 million square foot residential
1035680	1040320	and hotel complex outside of Sarajevo, making it the largest real estate project in the
1040320	1041780	country's history.
1041780	1045880	This addition is being touted as a second home community that will attract both Bosnian
1045880	1050500	and international visitors, and expand the developer's global footprint.
1050500	1054840	When much of the world was brought to a standstill, a Mongolian cuckoo made its most epic journey
1054840	1061200	yet—an 8,000 mile, 13,000 kilometer return trip from South Africa to Mongolia, completing
1061200	1066360	a round-trip journey that's one of the longest ever recorded for a land bird.
1066360	1070820	Scientists tracked the bird using a GPS tag to study its habits, and were frankly surprised
1070820	1074040	it survived the year away and 27 border crossings.
1074040	1078260	Though long-distance birds aren't revelatory, the lengths to which this species went are
1078260	1084480	notable and perhaps poses more questions than answers such as, why go so far?
1084480	1089840	The Armenia-Azerbaijan War populated headlines this fall, but notably absent from those stories
1089840	1092880	were the United States' involvement in the conflict.
1092880	1097020	Prior to the Trump administration, the United States actively engaged in previous peace
1097020	1100840	negotiations in the region, but the America First doctrine that dominates the current
1100840	1104260	administration led to diplomatic disengagement there.
1104260	1108280	That said, the two countries still agreed to a ceasefire, which has already been tested
1108280	1112660	and broken, according to Russian peacekeepers, and now we'll see if the Biden administration
1112660	1115480	plans to become more involved.
1115480	1120400	Move over rum, Jamaica is looking to a new economic driver—bamboo.
1120400	1124560	The government announced efforts to boost bamboo production on the island nation, which
1124560	1127900	it sees as a more sustainable revenue source.
1127900	1132300	Bamboo is a quick-growing plant that can be used as an alternative to traditional wood
1132300	1134900	products in tissues, paper, and cloth.
1134900	1139740	Caribbean island nations are, in some cases, pushing for greener futures out of necessity—in
1139740	1145120	2019, Jamaica banned plastic bags and styrofoam—and also opportunity.
1145120	1148980	The EU's getting a lot of attention, and this time it's because North Macedonia and
1148980	1153860	Albania have restarted negotiations to join the 27-member institution.
1153860	1158260	The two Balkan countries were put on hold for two years after some EU members questioned
1158260	1162820	their track records regarding democracy and corruption, but those concerns have been assuaged
1162820	1167260	and there's renewed momentum for the two to join neighbors Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro,
1167260	1169500	and Bosnia in entering the EU.
1169500	1174860	Even with Great Britain's exit, the EU motto these days seems to be, the more, the merrier.
1174860	1179780	Qatar is Australia's third biggest destination for lamb exports behind the US and China,
1179780	1184320	but that's likely to change with the Arab country cancelling its subsidy of meat from
1184320	1185380	down under.
1185380	1190980	The subsidies, which support this $300 million a year trade, were set to expire in 2023,
1190980	1194400	but Qatar abruptly announced their end this year.
1194400	1199160	Some are linking the decision to Australia's criticism of Qatar's treatment of 13 Australian
1199160	1204280	women earlier this year, who were questionably strip-searched at Doha International Airport.
1204280	1210680	Qatar says that's not it, and rather it's to bolster their sustainability and independence.
1210680	1214640	If you're one of those people who are sketched out by large bodies of water and their unknown
1214640	1217420	contents, this won't provide comfort.
1217420	1221520	In Lithuania, a team of divers completing a survey for bridge repairs came across the
1221520	1225800	remains of a 16th-century soldier, including leather boots with spurs, a leather belt with
1225800	1228160	a buckle, and an iron sword.
1228160	1232480	Though the current bridge was built in 1934, records indicate there was also one in its
1232480	1234080	place 500 years ago.
1234080	1239240	It's the first underwater remains to be found in Lithuania, and researchers were impressed
1239240	1242820	by how well-preserved the skeleton was.
1242820	1244600	Know anyone looking for a pet elephant?
1244600	1248440	Well, Namibia has 170 of them for sale.
1248440	1252240	That's because, despite the mammal being on the endangered species list, they're
1252240	1256680	seeing a population rebound in the South African country thanks to successful conservation
1256680	1262160	measures, jumping from 7,500 in 1995 to 24,000 in 2019.
1262160	1267520	But, with their growth comes an increase in human-elephant conflict, as well as a fight
1267520	1270240	for natural resources during a drought year.
1270240	1275000	Auctioning off some of the pachyderms may alleviate some of the stress and raise funds
1275000	1276800	for the country.
1276800	1282640	President Adamo Barro assumed leadership in the Gambia in 2017 after 22 years of brutal
1282640	1287560	dictatorship, and at the time he promised to call for new elections after three years,
1287560	1290080	instead of serving the full five-year term.
1290080	1291660	Well, guess what?
1291660	1293480	Now he wants the full five.
1293480	1297240	Earlier this year, protesters took to the streets to show their disappointment and,
1297240	1302320	in turn, 137 of them were arrested and dozens more were detained.
1302320	1305840	For some residents, the show of four seemed like a harkening back to the country's darker
1305840	1309900	days, and it looks like Barro will be staying in power.
1309900	1315100	The second-largest diamond ever mined was unearthed in 2019, but it caused headlines
1315100	1317460	this year for its subsequent sale.
1317460	1323020	It wasn't a Diamond House or British Royal that bought the 1,758-carat gem, but French
1323020	1327040	company Louis Vuitton that purchased it from the Caro Mine in Botswana.
1327040	1330680	The sale isn't only notable because of the price—no numbers have been released but
1330680	1336000	some estimate around $50 million—but because the buyer is a relative newcomer to the super-high-end
1336000	1340760	jewelry market, and this boss move signals they're here to stay.
1340760	1345280	Scientists in Gabon discovered their own treasure this year, finding the largest pangolin ever
1345280	1348640	on record, and tagging it for research purposes.
1348640	1352640	The scaly mammal is thought to be one of the most frequently illegally trafficked animals
1352640	1356920	in the world, with much of the demand coming from Asia, and researchers are hoping that
1356920	1360300	by learning about the creature's habits and movements, they'll be better able to
1360300	1365680	protect it as demand increases for both its meat and bones, which are often used in Chinese
1365680	1367040	medicine.
1367040	1371840	Former Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Taman has denied any role in his ex-wife's murder
1371840	1377320	despite police reports that say he previously paid a $20,000 down payment for her killing,
1377320	1381020	which was part of a $180,000 total sum.
1381020	1385360	His ex-wife was shot in a car two days before his inauguration.
1385360	1389540	Before that, she rejected getting a divorce so that she could remain the First Lady.
1389540	1395480	He remarried two months after her death, but was forced to resign from power amid the controversy.
1395480	1400360	North Macedonia, which only became north in 2019 to differ itself from the Greek region
1400360	1405880	of Macedonia, has the potential to delineate itself through marijuana production too—if
1405880	1407720	the government will support it.
1407720	1412000	Though medical marijuana has been legal in the country since 2016, there's a new push
1412000	1417140	to legalize cannabis in all forms and to ramp up production to supply Western European countries
1417140	1421780	with pot, where sale and consumption are permitted in modest amounts, but huge grow operations
1421780	1422780	are not.
1422960	1427400	Toward the end of 2020, government officials signaled their support to make North Macedonia
1427400	1430880	a quote, cannabis superpower.
1430880	1435720	Burning and removing statues has been a thing this year, and a wood depiction of Melania
1435720	1440840	Trump erected in her hometown of Sejanica, Slovenia was no exception.
1440840	1445360	Someone set fire to the statue in July, so the artist took the reasonable action of replacing
1445360	1447740	it in more permanent bronze.
1447740	1452760	That was probably a good idea, since the town of 5,000 residents has seen upwards of 20,000
1452760	1459500	Melania tourists a year since 2016, when President Trump took office.
1459500	1463780	Vultures may not be the cutest birds, but they're one the animal kingdom needs for
1463780	1465420	their scavenger role.
1465420	1470140	Unfortunately, the hooded vulture in Guinea Bissau inched closer to extinction this year,
1470140	1473940	with the accidental poisoning of more than 1,000 of the birds.
1473940	1478620	There, residents put strychnine in the landfills to ward off feral dogs, with the unintended
1478620	1481940	consequence of it being consumed by the scavenging birds.
1481940	1486320	This actually happens a lot in Africa, and the vulture population across the continent
1486320	1488760	is highly threatened because of it.
1488760	1493760	A woman in Latvia made headlines for taking ten days off after her child was born, because
1493760	1496200	she took it as paternity leave.
1496200	1500280	Previously, same-sex couples in the country had not been granted the right to both take
1500280	1504560	parental leave, but she fought the ruling as unconstitutional, and was the first woman
1504560	1508240	in the country to use her paternity leave.
1508240	1511760	Arab countries trying to get the attention of Europeans are doing it in perhaps the most
1511760	1515980	obvious way ever—through soccer, or football, for the rest of the world.
1515980	1520640	That's why Bahrain purchased a minority stake in football club Paris FC this year,
1520640	1524660	with a direct goal to attract more Europeans to the Gulf state, which is still feeling
1524660	1529280	the negative effects of stifling pro-democracy uprisings during the Arab Spring, and is therefore
1529280	1533060	trying to patch up its global reputation.
1533060	1537140	We hear a lot about the migration crises of people traveling from Africa to Europe and
1537140	1540900	Central America to the United States, but a movement that gets less coverage is the
1540900	1545200	one of Venezuelans, many of which go to Trinidad and Tobago.
1545200	1550780	By late 2020, there were almost 20,000 registered refugees in the island nation, but amid the
1550780	1554120	ones who made it, there are tragic stories too.
1554120	1559400	Most recently, 11 Venezuelans, including children, died in a boat trying to cross the Gulf of
1559400	1565200	Paria, which separates Trinidad from the Venezuelan coast by just under 7 miles or 11 kilometers.
1565200	1569240	When a constitutional referendum passed in Guinea earlier this year that allowed the
1569240	1573280	president to run for a third term instead of ending at two, it was certainly created
1573280	1575720	with President Alpha Conde in mind.
1575720	1580120	There were protests then, and again when he was re-elected in October with nearly 60%
1580120	1581120	of a vote.
1581120	1585000	Since the results, dozens have died in the demonstrations, but that didn't stop him
1585000	1589440	from being sworn into office earlier this month.
1589440	1593700	Cyber warfare seems like something that happens in the ether, but American operatives actually
1593700	1598220	traveled to Estonia prior to the American election in November to learn about the northeastern
1598220	1601340	European countries' sophisticated defense tactics.
1601340	1605560	Specifically, the US had Russian hackers in mind, and Estonia has one of the stronger
1605560	1611540	defense networks because Russia used to test its malware and disinformation campaigns there.
1611540	1617440	A whistleblower from a 2004 case between Australia and East Timor continues to draw attention,
1617440	1621220	and this year the lawyer for the anonymous whistleblower, referred to as Witness K, won
1621220	1624500	a free speech prize for his work on the case.
1624500	1628840	Witness K and lawyer Bernard Coolery revealed that Australia was spying on conversations
1628840	1633800	between East Timorese officials about oil and gas negotiations in the Timor Sea.
1633800	1637400	East Timor is one of the poorer countries in the world, and whistleblowing did help
1637400	1641240	the country get a fairer financial deal.
1641240	1646720	Mauritius is an Indian Ocean island country that sees 1.3 million visitors each year,
1646720	1649680	many coming for its lagoons, tropical jungles, and mountains.
1650260	1655940	But a Japanese oil tanker ran ashore in July spilling 1,000 tons of fuel into the sea,
1655940	1659820	and since then more than 40 dolphins have washed up on shore.
1659820	1663880	Some are worried the disaster could extend beyond dying dolphins and severely impact
1663880	1669380	the country's environment and therefore its primary tourist draw—the pristine nature.
1669380	1674580	Those who are in are in, but now that Cyprus has shut the door on its golden passport program,
1674580	1678440	it will be harder for people to buy their way into the European Union.
1678440	1683420	More than 3,000 foreigners who agreed to invest $2 million each into the country benefited
1683420	1687820	from this program in its seven-year existence, but new allegations of, and no one could've
1687820	1691340	guessed this, corruption have led officials to suspend the program.
1691340	1693740	But that's not to say it wasn't worth it.
1693740	1697300	Cyprus strays $7 billion from it, all told.
1697300	1703040	Eswatini joined an exclusive club this past fall—countries that have consulates to Morocco
1703040	1704860	in the Western Sahara.
1704860	1709440	As covered earlier, this is a disputed zone claimed both by Morocco and the Polisario
1709440	1714040	Front, and many countries choose not to state a strong position on the issue.
1714040	1718440	With the opening of a consulate to Morocco in the Western Saharan city of Laoun, however,
1718440	1723040	the Kingdom of Eswatini is firmly positioning itself on Morocco's side, and it becomes
1723040	1726840	the 15th country to open a consulate to Morocco in the area.
1726840	1730560	Do you remember the chameleon that hadn't been seen for 100 years in Madagascar?
1730560	1734600	There's another good story like it out of Djibouti, where a mouse-sized elephant shrew
1734600	1737740	has been seen again for the first time in 50 years.
1737740	1741700	The good news in this case, unlike with the chameleon, is that the shrew's habitat isn't
1741700	1746660	under threat, so scientists finding 12 animals from the 1000 traps set hopefully means it
1746660	1749420	won't be another 50 years until they're seen again.
1749420	1754540	When it comes to sharing good news, Fiji beat out all other countries to become the first
1754540	1758180	nation to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden on his victory.
1758180	1762860	Fijian Prime Minister Frank Beni Marama sent out the celebratory tweet before any other
1762860	1766320	heads of state, but it wasn't purely altruistic.
1766320	1770200	In the tweet, he called for action on the planet's climate emergency, and asked Biden
1770200	1773960	to bring the United States back into the Paris Agreement.
1773960	1778060	Think back to the origins of the pandemic, when the world still thought it would be confined
1778060	1779060	to China.
1779060	1783520	That's when the tiny island nation of the Comoros got some media attention for giving
1783520	1788080	China 100 euros as a show of solidarity in fighting the virus.
1788080	1792160	Of course, few places would be untouched, and it did hit the Comoros in late April,
1792160	1796540	but ultimately, the Chinese-Comoros relationship is ongoing, as the world's most populated
1796540	1801480	country continues to invest in the East African island as part of its military and economic
1801480	1802660	strategy.
1802660	1807420	Guyana is poised to be one of the world's next big oil producers, but there are some
1807420	1810100	who aren't happy about that potential.
1810100	1814740	ExxonMobil found sites that could potentially deliver 8 billion barrels of oil, which could
1814740	1820180	amount to more than $20 billion in revenue for one of South America's poorer countries.
1820180	1824920	The World Bank has pledged $55 million to help the country in its development, but critics
1824920	1828560	say this opposes global goals in curbing fossil fuel dependency.
1828560	1834680	China, India, and Bhutan are in ongoing negotiations over their definitive borders—the 25th round
1834680	1838580	of talks was delayed this year because of, well, you know, everything—but that didn't
1838580	1843600	stop impatient Chinese from constructing and inhabiting a village 1 mile or 1.6 kilometers
1843600	1846600	within Bhutan's recognized border this year.
1846620	1850660	This territorial grab is something China continues to do, especially to its immediate neighbors
1850660	1855700	such as Bhutan, which has just under 800,000 residents and poses little threat to the world
1855700	1857860	and military superpower.
1857860	1862180	What do China, Iran, North Korea, and the Solomon Islands all have in common?
1862180	1865360	Well, as of now, it's a Facebook ban.
1865360	1869740	The South Pacific nation plans to join the three countries in banning the social media
1869740	1874620	site because, according to officials, citizens are using it to abuse political leaders and
1874620	1876920	access dangerous information.
1876920	1880840	Facebook was used as an organizing tool for protests that crippled the nation's capital
1880840	1886320	last year, and critics of the ban say this is a move to stop criticism of the government.
1886320	1891760	The United States military is the strongest in the world, and other countries want a piece
1891760	1892760	of it.
1892760	1900240	For $36 million, Montenegro was able to buy a taste—67 joint light tactical vehicles.
1900240	1904720	The agreement is part of a NATO-ally deal that allows such transactions between countries,
1904720	1908740	and Montenegro is on the United States' friendly list as Western allies try to massage
1908740	1912280	the region out of its Russian-dominated past.
1912280	1917420	Looking to ease traffic congestion, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to offer
1917420	1920860	public transportation entirely for free.
1920860	1926180	Officials say it could save households roughly $125 per year, and also encourage public transportation
1926180	1931960	use versus private vehicles, which account for 71% of leisure travel and 47% of business.
1931960	1936220	A new tramway in the country's capital is one attractive alternative for riders.
1936220	1940660	There is an exception, though—first-class passengers will still have to pay.
1940660	1945500	South America's Suriname is switching gears, with the election of a new president who replaces
1945500	1950280	a dictator-turned-populist running on a poor economic record and a pension for corruption.
1950280	1955640	The new president, Censtantoki, assumes leadership of a country on the brink of financial collapse
1955640	1957260	and diplomatic disarray.
1957260	1961700	In recent years, the country turned to China and Venezuela for global ties, but Censtantoki
1961700	1967020	will be tasked in realigning the country with its former imperial power, the Netherlands.
1967020	1971320	When a Japanese couple on a world tour slash honeymoon were stranded due to pandemic travel
1971320	1976020	bans on the ten tiny islands off the coast of West Africa known as Cape Verde, they settled
1976020	1978680	in for five months and got to know the locals.
1978680	1983880	Now, they'll be ambassadors for the country at the upcoming Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
1983940	1987820	Cape Verde is sending three to four athletes, and though they've never won a medal in
1987820	1992540	the Summer Games, they will at least be well-represented this time.
1992540	1997340	Global superpowers continue to fight for strategic power on islands throughout the world, and
1997340	2001560	this time, the United States has its eyes on the Maldives, where it announced it is
2001560	2003460	opening an embassy.
2003460	2008180	The string of 1,100 islands is also in the crosshairs of India and China, which have
2008180	2010060	financially supported the nation.
2010080	2014940	China has lent the country millions in infrastructure loans, which the Maldives are finding increasingly
2014940	2019640	hard to pay back, and that potentially puts them in a debt-trap diplomacy situation.
2019640	2023060	The US has promised a different approach.
2023060	2027760	Our favorite nature narrator Sir David Attenborough gifted seven-year-old Prince George a prehistoric
2027760	2032920	shark tooth that he collected while on family vacation in Malta more than 50 years ago.
2032920	2035640	Malta did not appreciate the gesture.
2035640	2040080	People said the 23-million-year-old fossil, which likely belonged to a megalodon, should
2040080	2043840	rightfully find its place among their own country's cultural heritage.
2043840	2048160	The Maltese eventually formally decided to let it slide this time, opting to avoid making
2048160	2050400	the young prince cry.
2050400	2054900	A couple of cases of beer may sound like a party in some countries, but in Brunei, for
2054900	2057980	a foreigner, it meant getting questioned by police.
2057980	2063280	An Indonesian national was found with 57 beers in his car at a road stop, which was a problem
2063280	2067460	for him because alcohol is actually illegal in the country.
2067460	2072200	There is an exception for non-Muslim foreigners, who are allowed to possess up to 12 cans or
2072200	2077600	2 liters of beer, but he had four times the limit, and that's a party foul.
2077600	2082920	It appears that fish off the coast of Belize have tamed a shrimp species in the same-ish
2082920	2087880	way that humans domesticated dogs, at least according to new scientific research.
2087880	2093080	Apparently, the damselfish aggressively defends a patch of algae against all predators because
2093080	2097480	that's where it harvests food, but it allows misid shrimp to hang around.
2097480	2102000	In turn, the shrimp fertilize the algae so it's better food for the damselfish.
2102000	2107200	After time, the shrimp rely on the fish for protection, and that's domestication.
2107200	2112180	Exploratory drilling near the Bahamas, and 150 miles or 240 kilometers from the Florida
2112180	2116720	coast, is set to take place soon, despite opposition from environmental groups and a
2116720	2119360	ban from the United States on offshore drilling.
2119360	2124160	That's because the Bahamas Petroleum Company has leases on potential oil fields in the
2124160	2126720	area, and they're exercising them.
2126720	2130840	Some are worried about the environmental effects should something go wrong, as has been the
2130840	2135320	case time and time again, but the Bahamas sees dollar signs that it needs in order to
2135320	2140640	compensate for the financial hit it took when tourism ground to a halt this year.
2140640	2145000	Researchers studying islanders in a less tropical part of the world found one interesting, and
2145000	2147360	potentially evolutionary, trait.
2147360	2153600	It seems that 2% of Iceland's residents can't smell foul fish—in fact, when presented
2153600	2159280	with the malodorous sample, they pleasantly detected caramel, rose, or potatoes.
2159280	2164600	These scientific human specimens possess a mutation that turns off their TAAR5 gene—you
2164600	2169040	know, the one responsible for making a protein that recognizes trimethylamine, aka chemical
2169040	2172840	found in rotten fish and sometimes human sweat and urine.
2172840	2177080	Vanuatu is a country that's been hit hard by Mother Nature, having experienced two
2177080	2181760	volcanic eruptions and two category 5 cyclones in the past five years.
2181760	2186080	Disaster relief is something officials there are having to learn quickly and execute often.
2186080	2190780	To do so, one system they've recently implemented is distributing emergency relief funds to
2190780	2194580	residents via blockchain technology and tap-and-pay cards.
2194580	2198080	The cards are loaded with money that residents can use immediately, and it avoids some of
2198080	2202160	the red tape that typically consumes relief efforts.
2202160	2206480	Racial reckoning sparked movements worldwide, and that groundswell did not leave the island
2206520	2208560	of Barbados untouched.
2208560	2212560	This most eastern island in the Caribbean formally announced it would remove Queen Elizabeth
2212560	2217620	as its head of state and become a republic in 2021, citing long-simmering tensions about
2217620	2220960	the legacy of colonization and racial injustice.
2220960	2224680	Some see the island's decision to part with the monarchy as a tipping point for neighboring
2224680	2228700	countries who may also seek their own independence.
2228700	2233360	To help young women in Sao Tome and Principe, the World Bank announced its commitment of
2233360	2236160	$15 million to empower young girls.
2236160	2240360	Providing safe learning spaces in schools is one of the immediate goals of the funding,
2240360	2244200	where dropping out and pregnancy are common for girls at a young age.
2244200	2248220	Concurrently, but unrelated to the funding, the country's National Olympic Committee
2248220	2252880	announced a push to encourage girls aged 6 to 18 into surfing lessons—another way to
2252880	2257120	steer young women into positive alternatives, and potentially build their summer Olympics
2257120	2258120	team.
2258120	2263080	Samoa's state-owned flag carrier Samoa Airways was reporting financial trouble at a loss
2263080	2267360	of $25 million in 2019, according to reports.
2267360	2271200	That was before this year, and the decimation of passenger demand, and so it's not looking
2271200	2272780	any better for them.
2272780	2277740	The airline also reportedly owes $11 million to creditors, but of course, executives are
2277740	2279780	painting a rosier picture.
2279780	2285480	This all comes as Samoa Airways tries to complete its lease negotiations for a Boeing 737-800
2285480	2288680	from the Netherlands, and further debt could hinder those.
2289280	2293600	When it comes to the world's top honeymoon destination, there's one place that keeps
2293600	2299760	blowing every other location out of international waters, so to speak—Saint Lucia.
2299760	2304000	The Caribbean island was named the number one honeymoon locale for the 12th time and
2304000	2305680	third consecutive year.
2305680	2310720	The World Travel Awards were announced virtually in Moscow this year, and hopefully, by this
2310720	2315760	time next year, people won't have to take a virtual honeymoon to Saint Lucia.
2315840	2320880	This change is impacting all islands, including the 32 atolls that comprise the nation of
2320880	2321880	Kiribati.
2321880	2326160	That's why President Tenati Maumau will accept funding from China to dredge sand along
2326160	2330160	the most populous islands to actually raise them out of the sea.
2330160	2334560	Some see this as a strategic play by China, to inch further into the Pacific Ocean, where
2334560	2338720	military presence closer to the United States would certainly be a power move.
2338720	2343320	Maumau, however, says Kiribati would not grant China the gift of building a base on its nearby
2343320	2348480	Christmas Island, which just happens to be relatively close to Hawaii.
2348480	2354000	The Federated States of Micronesia are composed of more than 600 islands stretching 1,600
2354000	2358000	miles or 2,700 kilometers across the Pacific Ocean.
2358000	2361800	The country's population is quite small in comparison to the vastness that gives it
2361800	2365480	the 14th largest exclusive economic zone in the world.
2365480	2370160	This is what makes the rescue of three stranded men who wrote SOS in the sand on a deserted
2370160	2371600	atoll most impressive.
2371600	2376800	They'd run out of fuel and drifted 118 miles or 190 kilometers west of their departure
2376800	2381980	point, and were spotted by a search plane three days after their departure.
2381980	2385940	Another stranded island story transports us to Grenada, where a British woman visiting
2385940	2390240	the Caribbean island found herself stuck thanks to the spring's travel bans.
2390240	2394500	The problem is that she was six months pregnant, and ended up delivering her child on the island
2394500	2395760	prematurely.
2395760	2400040	She ended up securing a repatriation flight in June, becoming one of tens of thousands
2400040	2403680	of British who were chartered back from at least 57 countries.
2403680	2407960	We're getting to the smaller countries, and most of them are islands.
2407960	2413600	During 2015, a 30-mile, 50-kilometer algal bloom made a slow water surface crawl into
2413600	2418520	the Pacific, and scientists were baffled by what caused it, until a report was released
2418520	2419640	this year.
2419640	2424700	The patch was created by Tonga Island runoff, rich in iron and phosphorus.
2424700	2430200	This is common, but its delayed appearance is not, and that's what confused scientists.
2430200	2434440	It took some time for a nitrogen fixer to utilize the nutrients, making it seem like
2434440	2439840	the bloom came out of nowhere when it had actually slow-cooked its way across the ocean.
2439840	2443780	Travel between Ukraine and St. Vincent and the Grenadines became easier following the
2443780	2447480	signing of a visa-free travel agreement between the two countries.
2447480	2451660	The Caribbean country is part of the Commonwealth of Nations, a political association of 54
2451660	2455000	members, nearly all former territories of the British Empire.
2455000	2459520	Ukraine has its eyes on some of the more powerful Commonwealth members granting visa-free travel,
2459520	2463800	or at least the ambassador tweeted an allusion to that, with Australia, the UK, and Canada
2463800	2465040	on his wishlist.
2465040	2470360	It's been 44 years since the Seychelles secured its independence from Britain, and
2470360	2474860	this year marked the first time that a president from the opposition party won an election
2474860	2476800	since the country's British breakaway.
2476820	2481300	That's being heralded as a step towards greater democracy, with Wavell Ram Calawan
2481300	2487140	defeating an incumbent from the United Seychelles Party, which had been in power since 1977.
2487140	2492020	British sailor and 72-year-old man Graham Walters was super social distancing when he
2492020	2496420	sailed from Great Britain to Antigua, setting the record for the oldest person to cross
2496420	2497900	the Atlantic Ocean solo.
2497900	2502580	It was actually his fifth trip across the ocean, and he nearly went awry at the end
2502580	2506980	when strong winds blew him 6 miles or 10 kilometers off course of Antigua.
2506980	2510860	He was able to call the Coast Guard and get a tow to his final destination, and officials
2510860	2514800	still counted it as a world record even with the assist.
2514800	2520800	One of the tiniest European countries, Andorra, joined the big guns and became the 190th nation
2520800	2523560	to become a part of the International Monetary Fund.
2523560	2524840	But why now?
2524840	2529280	Well, crisis financing mostly, which the IMF comes through on for countries in need, among
2529280	2530640	other missions.
2530660	2535260	Trade and tourism—mostly ski resorts and hiking trails—contribute to 40% of the mountainous
2535260	2538900	country's economy, and they're hurting right now with a lack thereof.
2538900	2543580	A Caribbean island that's counting on tourism and the economy bouncing back is Dominica.
2543580	2548320	It announced its intentions to build a new long-haul airport, capitalizing on a growing
2548320	2551020	eco-tourism and offshore financial sector.
2551020	2554660	Currently, visitors must transfer to Dominica through a neighboring island, but this new
2554660	2559060	airport would make direct trips from the United States, United Kingdom, and Western Europe
2559060	2560420	more possible.
2560420	2564560	Officials say it will be largely financed by foreigners who pay in exchange for a passport,
2564560	2567960	but it seems that we've heard this story before.
2567960	2571820	What drifts away from the coast of Mexico likely ends up at the Marshall Islands, according
2571820	2573520	to computer simulations.
2573520	2576840	In this case, it was a boat full of cocaine.
2576840	2581320	Without any evidence or leads, law enforcement officials have theorized that a boat filled
2581320	2586660	with 1,430 pounds or 650 kilograms of the illegal drug came from the Mexican or Central
2586660	2591260	American coast, and it had probably been floating captainless for at least a year.
2591260	2595540	Though drugs have washed up onshore before, this was the largest ever haul, and it was
2595540	2597620	quickly incinerated.
2597620	2601260	It seems that Caribbean islands are all vying for new citizens, and the influx of money
2601260	2602260	they bring.
2602260	2607180	Saint Kitts and Nevis has made the process so easy that wealthy investors can get citizenship
2607180	2611760	in under 60 days—one of the fastest tracks in the world—without even having to step
2611760	2615800	foot in the country, and for that they've been recognized by the Financial Times for
2615800	2619280	having one of the best citizen-by-investment programs.
2619280	2626060	For $150,000, a family of four can call Saint Kitts their second, or third, or fourth home.
2626060	2630560	Sir Jim Ratcliffe is another wealthy individual moving to sunnier skies—he's leaving the
2630560	2636440	United Kingdom for Monaco, where he'll save up to $5.4 billion in taxes.
2636440	2642760	Ratcliffe is a petrochemicals magnate with an estimated worth of $23.6 billion.
2642760	2647680	People who live in Monaco for at least 183 days a year don't pay income or property
2647680	2652720	taxes, and that's a lot different from the up to 45% he could be paying under the UK's
2652720	2654360	tax system.
2654360	2659600	Sandwiched between Austria and Switzerland, Liechtenstein said no to developing an international
2659600	2660680	rail system.
2660680	2666320	The country is only 15 miles or 25 kilometers long, and has just one domestic track.
2666320	2669940	This initiative would have widened it and upgraded one of the terminals so that international
2669940	2674100	trains could stop there, but voters turned down the project at the polls—balking at
2674100	2677820	the $73.5 million price tag.
2677820	2682500	With a 6pm curfew in Italy due to lockdowns, residents looking for a little nightlife are
2682500	2687400	hopping the border into San Marino, where bars and restaurants are open until 10pm.
2687400	2691460	The small, independent country is just ten minutes from cities such as Raimini, and Italian
2691460	2695460	officials are frustrated that by San Marino not falling in line with their own guidelines,
2695460	2699820	they're putting more citizens at risk of spreading the virus.
2699820	2704980	Palau, about 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometers from the Philippines, has a free association
2704980	2709580	agreement with the United States that delivers significant financial aid, and gives Palauans
2709580	2712820	the right to travel to, live, and work in the US.
2712820	2718500	But that current compact expires in 2024, and Palau wants even more US presence.
2718500	2722540	They've invited America to build a military base on their island.
2722540	2727340	Currently, Palau has no military, and they see an American base there as a way to bolster
2727340	2731340	security, and for the United States, it's a way to push back against growing Chinese
2731340	2733240	influence in the region.
2733240	2738220	The Perth Mint in Australia produces Tuvalu's currency, including the Tuvalu dollar, which
2738220	2742580	is used alongside the Australian dollar and a series of collectible coins.
2742580	2746660	This year, Tuvalu issued a coin of American film star John Wayne that has been selling
2746660	2748780	for more than $100.
2748780	2753060	It turns out, the collectible coin business is quite lucrative for the tiny island, which
2753060	2757020	receives about $200,000 a year in royalties.
2757020	2760880	The coins are technically legal tender, but more so they're purchased by international
2760880	2763100	collectors.
2763100	2767740	Australia uses the tiny Micronesian island of Nauru as an outpost for refugees to spend
2767740	2770020	time while their claims are processed.
2770020	2774380	In combination with Papua New Guinea, where detainees are also kept, there are about 300
2774380	2779700	people held, but Australia spent $1.2 billion this financial year to keep them there, equally
2779700	2782100	about $4 million per person.
2782100	2785760	This is causing many to turn their heads at the exorbitant cost that would be better spent
2785760	2788200	just keeping those refugees in Australia.
2788200	2792760	On top of that, conditions in the refugee camps are poor and sometimes dangerous, so
2792760	2795980	the money has not been well spent.
2795980	2799700	And here we are, the world's smallest country, the Vatican City.
2799700	2805560	This year has a very 2020 story—Catholicism's headquarters may have missed the mark on the
2805560	2806820	nativity scene.
2806820	2811400	Each year, the Holy City produces a new scene donated by an Italian city.
2811400	2815660	This year Castelli, a town known for ceramics, got the spotlight, but the curious stylings
2815660	2819660	of coiled clay-meat astronauts have received curious reviews.
2819660	2823740	Castellians made the figures over decades, and they've survived natural disasters and
2823740	2824740	more.
2824740	2829120	One observer saw hope in the scene—quote, it's a nativity scene that has had problems
2829120	2831700	like we've all had in a lousy year, she said.
2831700	2834340	If it made it, we can.
2834340	2835340	And that's it.
2835340	2839220	That's the news you missed in 2020, or at least some of it, from every country in the
2839220	2840220	world.
2840220	2844140	If you've made it to this point, you're clearly a lover of learning about the world.
2844140	2848020	Therefore, I'm going to recommend you an audiobook from our sponsor, Audible, that
2848020	2852360	would honestly be stunned if someone who made it through all 195 countries has not already
2852360	2853360	listened to.
2853360	2858220	It's Prisoners of Geography, by Tim Marshall, which is this fascinating read about how geography
2858220	2859420	constrains countries.
2859420	2864240	It explains things like why Putin is so focused on Crimea, why Europe will never be united,
2864240	2866940	and why the US was destined to become a superpower.
