1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
Welcome back to the news you missed in 2020 from every country in the world.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,960
If you haven't yet seen part one, make sure you go and watch that first—unless, of course,

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,600
you only care about the small countries, because we'll start with one with a rather petite

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,780
population of just eight and a half million.

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,840
An eight-year-old boy who tried to use spirit money—fake bills used in China as spiritual

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,360
offerings—at a grocery store in Switzerland didn't get Monopoly's go-to-jail card,

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,920
but he did get a mugshot and now has a police record.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,080
The heavy-handed punishment for using counterfeit money surprised residents because of the boy's

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,400
age and presumed naivete, and caused some embarrassment for the country, which discussed

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,840
the case openly in Parliament.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,440
Chevron's $4 billion acquisition of Texas-based Noble Energy was an American transaction,

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,000
but was rooted in Israel.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,880
That's because Noble Energy has built a large natural gas business in and around Israeli

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,440
waters, and the purchase essentially opens up the country to energy development—a nation

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,320
that had remained virtually untouched to such activities in order to maintain political

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,420
stability with Arab oil-producing countries.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,480
Not only does the deal unlock the potential for a brand new resource economy, but it demonstrates

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,800
that the Persian Gulf may now be more accepting of Israeli business.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,360
Togo became the first country in Africa to eliminate sleeping sickness—a sometimes

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,400
fatal parasitic infection transmitted by flies, found primarily in rural areas in 36 African

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
countries.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,000
After more than two decades of dedicated public health measures, the West African country

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,640
eliminated the illness, which causes fever, aches, and, most commonly, disrupts a person's

24
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,640
sleep.

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,340
The good news is that cases are also dropping throughout Africa, and the number of people

26
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,260
dying has dropped 90% since the early 90s, when the annual death toll reached a peak

27
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,420
of 34,000.

28
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,340
Some more good news out of Africa is that girls and young women who are pregnant in

29
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,880
Sierra Leone are no longer banned from attending school.

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,480
Previously, once pregnant, young women were not allowed to finish school or take their

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,060
exams, but this decision is a victory for feminism in the country, and will allow tens

32
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,720
of thousands of young women to potentially complete their education and provide them

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,660
with more opportunity in life.

34
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,960
The crater of a meteorite that hit Earth 800,000 years ago, blasting glass particles known

35
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,720
as tektites to over 10% of the planet, has gone unfound… until now.

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,260
Researchers think they have located the impact crater, stretching 11 miles or 17 kilometers

37
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,160
long by 8 miles or 13 kilometers wide and filled with about 300 feet or 90 meters of

38
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,040
rock, on a plateau in Laos.

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,760
Though a crater like this should have presented itself through erosion over eons, this elusive

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,240
hole was covered by more than 1,000 feet or 300 meters of lava flow, and was only discovered

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,280
on a hillside after it was carved out to pave a road.

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,000
Brazilian World Cup football star Ronaldinho spent the past six months in a Paraguayan

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,460
jail and house arrest for entering the country in March on an illegal passport.

44
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,760
The star player spent more than a month behind bars, and was then transported to a luxury

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,420
hotel and held there for another four months, while his legal troubles were sorted out between

46
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,480
the governments.

47
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,060
He says he didn't know the passport was fake.

48
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,160
During the latter part, he reportedly had parties in San Cariocchi, leading people to

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,700
wonder if prison is really that bad.

50
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,740
Speaking of fake passports and punishment, Raya, a three-month-old Chihuahua, was facing

51
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,460
euthanasia for traveling from her home country of Bulgaria to Norway, where she'd been

52
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:35,300
adopted, on a falsified passport, until action star Jean-Claude Van Damme stepped in, and

53
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,020
you can't make this stuff up.

54
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,340
Bulgaria initially refused to take the dog back, until Van Damme took to social media,

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:47,180
and the country capitulated, eventually repatriating her and putting her up for adoption again.

56
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,580
Remember that story about Israel, natural gas, and the Mediterranean Sea?

57
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,140
We're back to it, but this time with Lebanon involved.

58
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,100
The two countries started mediation for the first time in 30 years over part of the sea

59
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,360
because of their dual interest in energy development.

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,300
Both say that a 330-square-mile, 850-square-kilometer area of the sea is part of their exclusive

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,580
economic zone.

62
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,420
The two have been essentially at a standstill for decades, and even though they had to communicate

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,420
through mediators from the United States, their meeting marked a historic moment.

64
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:22,780
More mediation in the Middle East actually took place in the United Nations in Geneva,

65
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,540
but it led to a ceasefire between the two main warring factions in Africa's Libya.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,980
The two sides have been engaged in a bloody battle for years, and this newest peace attempt

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,980
brings some hope to both the country and to nearby nations that have previously tried

68
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,080
to intervene, such as Russia and Turkey.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,740
As Nicaragua continues to develop its natural resources, reports show that it may be doing

70
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,800
it at the cost of indigenous people's lives.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,060
The government is actively promoting illegal land grabs for timber and mining companies,

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,840
and there have been reports that more than 40 native people have been killed, though

73
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,640
the police refuse to investigate.

74
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,000
It's all the more complicated by the fact that President Daniel Ortega has family ties

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,660
to one of the most active timber companies working in the protected area.

76
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,960
Up the coast, Guatemala offered El Salvador the opportunity to build a port on its lands

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,300
and waters, giving Atlantic Ocean access to El Salvador, whose coastline is only on the

78
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Pacific.

79
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,940
In its initial phases, the port will likely be constructed through a private-public partnership

80
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,500
and infrastructure, such as hotels and warehouses, would be built around the port as well, bringing

81
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,620
a significant El Salvadorian presence to its neighboring country.

82
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,020
Alright, try to keep up with this one.

83
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,340
In Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia's only democracy, the President resigned after a week in hiding,

84
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,060
following a tumultuous election.

85
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,220
A few hours before his announcement, President Genbakov said he would not step down amid

86
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,300
the disputed election, but then he did and it left some wondering if his quick about-face

87
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,100
was triggered by threats of violence from a criminal-backed group.

88
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,280
The new leader is a former kidnapper who was sprung from jail by anti-government protesters

89
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,800
at the same time as Genbakov's resignation, raising many eyebrows.

90
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,160
Nearby, the President of Turkmenistan is widely known for his obsession with a breed of dog

91
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
called the Alibi.

92
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,240
So, it didn't come as a surprise that he erected a 19-foot, 6-meter-old statue of the

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,280
shepherd-like canine in a traffic circle in the country's capital.

94
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,920
Turkmenistan is also known to have one of the world's more repressive governments,

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,460
and doesn't even allow human rights organizations into the country.

96
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,180
That creates a definite disconnect in terms of humanizing animals, but treating humans

97
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,580
inhumanely.

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,060
Investors and entrepreneurs have keyed in on a new use for Australia's desolate and

99
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,060
unforgiving outback—turn it into a solar farm large enough to power the country of

100
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Singapore.

101
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,700
Sun Cable has announced a $90 billion, 10 gigawatt, 30,000-acre solar farm that will

102
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,460
send about two-thirds of the energy it produces north through undersea high-voltage cables.

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:04,060
If all goes right, the lights of Singapore could be solar-powered by 2027.

104
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,620
In another part of the global movement to cleaner energy, Denmark, the European Union's

105
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,260
largest oil producer, announced it would end all oil and gas exploration in the North Sea

106
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,300
as part of its commitment to phase out fossil fuel extraction by 2050.

107
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:23,380
Its existing 55 platforms, spread across 20 oil and gas fields, will continue operations,

108
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,620
but the decision to stop looking for more sends a powerful message to the world about

109
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,300
the future of energy, and this country's goal is to be a green leader.

110
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,900
Some of the world may be saying goodbye to fossil fuels, but an animal that oddly turns

111
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,660
out to like gas-powered vehicles, or at least their sounds, is a monkey.

112
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,180
A zoo in Finland gave their white-faced saki monkeys a choice between the sounds of traffic,

113
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,100
the jungle, zen, or dance music, and the primates overwhelmingly preferred honking cars and

114
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,500
screeching tires over the mimicry of their natural habitat.

115
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,960
When Slovakian President Zuzana Kaputova learned that Chinese telecom giant Huawei

116
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,220
was the sponsor for a defense conference at which she was slated to speak, she quickly

117
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,860
pressed end call and cancelled her talk.

118
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,260
She cited security risks, along with following her basic principles, since Huawei has been

119
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,100
accused of foreign interference.

120
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,020
Huawei eventually backed out of the conference, and Kaputova ended up taking the stage, but

121
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,460
the message was heard loud and clear.

122
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,060
The World Wildlife Foundation has been working for more than a decade to set up a national

123
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,020
park and nature reserve in the Republic of the Congo, however, this year, the European

124
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,620
Union pulled their funding upon reports that the anti-poaching guards patrolling the proposed

125
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,540
park have been engaging in physical violence against the indigenous people of the area,

126
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,060
and are restricting them from moving around on their own land.

127
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,260
The World Wildlife Foundation's application for EU funding specifically stated that the

128
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,700
indigenous people of the area were for the project, but given that that either no longer

129
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,200
or was never true, it's unclear whether this project will move forward.

130
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,220
Only three countries still allow commercial whaling, and Norway is one of them.

131
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,740
Typically, the Scandinavian country sends most of its whale meat to Japan, where demand

132
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,700
is high, but Norwegians are opting to consume more of the meat for the first time in years,

133
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,980
which is probably due to the growing movement against traditionally processed meat in favor

134
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,300
of locally sourced products, like the mink whales they hunt in their own waters.

135
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,100
Close your eyes if you don't want to see something bizarre.

136
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:30,740
It's the wrinkle-faced bat native to Costa Rica.

137
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,720
But of course, what one sees as ugly, others find sexy?

138
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,720
New research this year found that these elusive jungle dwellers mate in an interesting way.

139
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,500
The males congregate in big groups, perform a routine, and fold some of the extra skin

140
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:51,020
around their face up like a neck gaiter to seduce the females—and it seems to work.

141
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,300
Three Palestinian peace activists who held a Zoom call with Israelis that included more

142
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,220
than 200 participants and viewers were charged with quote, weakening revolutionary spirit.

143
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,580
Their goal was part of a bridge-building initiative called Skype with Your Enemy, but according

144
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,440
to Palestinian officials, communication with Israel is considered a quote, normalization

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,240
activity and punishable.

146
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,360
The three could face years in prison and hard labor sentences.

147
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,120
The Arab world's longest-serving ruler, the Sultan of Oman, died this year at the

148
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,080
age of 79.

149
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,860
Since he had no children, his cousin was chosen to replace him, ending years of speculation

150
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,320
on which of the more than 80 potential successors would gain the spot.

151
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,120
Upon his passing, the Sultan was recognized for his steadfast, diplomatic reign by other

152
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,640
world leaders.

153
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,060
This is a seemingly peaceful story about a leadership change, amid a flurry of headlines

154
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,560
this year that were quite the opposite.

155
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,260
It's easier to get to Liberia from France, as well as other western destinations, now

156
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,320
that Air France resumed its flight from Paris to Monrovia after a nine-year hiatus.

157
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,200
The direct flight debuted on an Airbus A350, which landed at a newly refurbished Robert

158
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,660
International Airport in Liberia.

159
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,240
Officials boasted about the newly improved connections between the United States, United

160
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,060
Kingdom, India, and China with the return of this flight, and, naturally, the strengthened

161
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,120
ties between Liberia and France.

162
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,880
When visitors to the North Pole buried a time capsule there in 2018, they thought it would

163
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,820
be 40 years until it was discovered, but, because of climate change and the fast-melting

164
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,920
Arctic, the artifacts were found much sooner.

165
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,720
They washed up on the shores of Ireland this year, some 2,300 miles or 3,700 kilometers

166
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
away.

167
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,440
That's obviously another bad sign for the Arctic, which some scientists say will be

168
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,520
ice-free by the summer of 2035.

169
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:47,780
Last year, a volcano on New Zealand's White Island erupted and killed 22 people, including

170
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,200
children and seniors, who were there with tour groups.

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,880
Now, 13 parties have been charged in their deaths, with lawsuits claiming negligence

172
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,160
for allowing people to visit the site of an active volcano.

173
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,700
A family owns the island, and tours were run by a small group of operators, but the island

174
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,980
has been closed to visitors ever since.

175
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,620
A Sudanese militia leader who had been on the run for 13 years was arrested in a remote

176
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,340
corner of the Central African Republic, near the border with Sudan, which is where he allegedly

177
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,080
carried out crimes against humanity, including mass campaigns of murder, rape, and looting

178
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:27,100
in the early 2000s, which partially contributed to a humanitarian crisis in which 300,000

179
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,640
people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.

180
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,920
His arrest and subsequent trial at The Hague will potentially bring justice to many who

181
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,420
have suffered in Darfur.

182
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,520
For several months, Mauritania banned Senegal from fishing in its waters because of illegal,

183
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,320
unreported, and unregulated fishing, which they say cost their country up to $300 million

184
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,440
in lost revenue.

185
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,640
Now, under the new agreement, Senegal will pay Mauritania for the actual fish it catches,

186
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,040
which means no more punitive fines for the country instead.

187
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,240
This seems like a win-win for the two West African countries, and demonstrates some progress

188
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,540
towards countries all happily sharing the same pond.

189
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,480
In 2016, the Panama Papers exposed how some of the world's most prominent politicians,

190
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,540
business leaders, and celebrities set up offshore bank accounts to conceal their wealth and

191
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,240
avoid taxes in the Central American country.

192
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,500
So, of course, Netflix made a movie about it.

193
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,280
But now, the law firm behind the 11.5 million documents is not happy about their portrayal

194
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,960
as quote, ruthless, uncaring, and unethical lawyers, so they're doing the most lawyer

195
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,760
thing possible and suing Netflix.

196
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,280
Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca are claiming defamation and asks Netflix to cease streaming

197
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,680
The Laundromat, though it's already been screened to crowds at European film festivals.

198
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,840
Readers, writers, and free speech advocates are rejoicing now that officials in Kuwait

199
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,540
disbanded a committee that banned more than 5,000 books over seven years.

200
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,900
The country's Ministry of Information will no longer have the control to censor titles

201
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,700
like Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and 100 Years of Solitude by Gabrielle

202
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
Garcia Marquez.

203
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,600
But besides banning book imports, the committee also had a say over every title that was published

204
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,660
in the country.

205
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,420
Now they don't, and that means the words should flow more freely.

206
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,660
Here's a tip—if you're German but wanted in the United States for building software

207
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,900
that tricks automobile emissions inspectors, then don't cross from Germany, where you're

208
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,580
elected, into Croatia, where you're not.

209
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,800
Apparently, former Volkswagen executive Alex Eiser didn't get the memo that only his

210
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,900
native country doesn't extradite its own citizens.

211
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,500
He was arrested when crossing the border in June, and will likely be charged in the United

212
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,380
States since America and Croatia signed an extradition treaty last year.

213
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,520
He's at the center of the emissions scandal in which the German auto manufacturer tried

214
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,220
to evade US Clean Air Act laws by tricking the system, and his arrest shows that the

215
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,380
United States isn't finished with its car chase yet.

216
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,460
Moldova is veering away from its Putin-leaning ways, at least temporarily, with its election

217
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:05,580
of Maia Sandu, a pro-Western, Harvard-educated former prime minister, and its ouster of incumbent

218
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,500
pro-Russian president Igor Dodonu.

219
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,940
Besides favoring European ties, Sandu is also the country's first woman president.

220
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,820
She ran on an anti-corruption platform and championed embracing the country's Romanian

221
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,700
roots—as 75 of the countries speaks Romanian—over its ties to Russia.

222
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,160
Tiny Moldova is sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, which have also leaned more Russian

223
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,060
in recent years, and the results demonstrate this region's increased shift away from

224
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
Russia.

225
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,980
If you're tired of hearing about Georgia, the US state, you can opt to move to the Eastern

226
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,040
European country of the same name to escape the 24-7 news.

227
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,660
The nation recently announced a visa-free entry program, called Remotely from Georgia,

228
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,400
that grants year-long stays to nationals from 95 countries.

229
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,700
There are some caveats—transplants must earn at least $2,000 per month and have health

230
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,100
insurance—meaning the country is looking for a certain type of more permanent visitor—one

231
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,840
that has money and can contribute to its faltering economy.

232
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,100
The European Union is being held accountable for the way it funds projects in Africa, thanks

233
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,700
to a group of air-trains in the Netherlands.

234
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,080
They allege that the EU is paying for forced labor by funding heavy construction equipment

235
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,480
to open and pave a road that connects the Ethiopia-Eritrea border with the Eritrean

236
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,020
port of Massawa.

237
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,200
That equipment is apparently being run by conscripts.

238
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,420
The project is part of a $6 billion injection from the EU into Africa as a way to curb migration

239
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:32,400
from south to north, but this case shows that more oversight is needed in the process.

240
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,640
Another immigration story centers around a steady stream of Argentinians relocating to

241
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,200
Uruguay—a move that the latter is quite happy about.

242
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,040
Uruguay enticed residents from its southern neighbor by lowering the minimum value of

243
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,000
property required for tax residency from $1.7 million to $380,000, and by offering a 10-year

244
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,200
tax holiday.

245
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,620
That, in turn, has led close to 20,000 people to flock north this year—a number equivalent

246
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,560
to about 0.6% of Uruguay's population of 3.5 million—meaning the great pandemic migration

247
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,680
continues.

248
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:10,340
Also signaling that Bosnia-Herzegovina is next on the luxury destination list, Saudi

249
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,680
developer Dar Al Arkan announced this year it would build a 5 million square foot residential

250
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,320
and hotel complex outside of Sarajevo, making it the largest real estate project in the

251
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,780
country's history.

252
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,880
This addition is being touted as a second home community that will attract both Bosnian

253
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,500
and international visitors, and expand the developer's global footprint.

254
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,840
When much of the world was brought to a standstill, a Mongolian cuckoo made its most epic journey

255
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,200
yet—an 8,000 mile, 13,000 kilometer return trip from South Africa to Mongolia, completing

256
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,360
a round-trip journey that's one of the longest ever recorded for a land bird.

257
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,820
Scientists tracked the bird using a GPS tag to study its habits, and were frankly surprised

258
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,040
it survived the year away and 27 border crossings.

259
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:58,260
Though long-distance birds aren't revelatory, the lengths to which this species went are

260
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,480
notable and perhaps poses more questions than answers such as, why go so far?

261
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,840
The Armenia-Azerbaijan War populated headlines this fall, but notably absent from those stories

262
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,880
were the United States' involvement in the conflict.

263
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,020
Prior to the Trump administration, the United States actively engaged in previous peace

264
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,840
negotiations in the region, but the America First doctrine that dominates the current

265
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,260
administration led to diplomatic disengagement there.

266
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,280
That said, the two countries still agreed to a ceasefire, which has already been tested

267
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,660
and broken, according to Russian peacekeepers, and now we'll see if the Biden administration

268
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,480
plans to become more involved.

269
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,400
Move over rum, Jamaica is looking to a new economic driver—bamboo.

270
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,560
The government announced efforts to boost bamboo production on the island nation, which

271
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,900
it sees as a more sustainable revenue source.

272
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Bamboo is a quick-growing plant that can be used as an alternative to traditional wood

273
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,900
products in tissues, paper, and cloth.

274
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,740
Caribbean island nations are, in some cases, pushing for greener futures out of necessity—in

275
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,120
2019, Jamaica banned plastic bags and styrofoam—and also opportunity.

276
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,980
The EU's getting a lot of attention, and this time it's because North Macedonia and

277
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,860
Albania have restarted negotiations to join the 27-member institution.

278
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,260
The two Balkan countries were put on hold for two years after some EU members questioned

279
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,820
their track records regarding democracy and corruption, but those concerns have been assuaged

280
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,260
and there's renewed momentum for the two to join neighbors Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro,

281
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,500
and Bosnia in entering the EU.

282
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,860
Even with Great Britain's exit, the EU motto these days seems to be, the more, the merrier.

283
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,780
Qatar is Australia's third biggest destination for lamb exports behind the US and China,

284
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:44,320
but that's likely to change with the Arab country cancelling its subsidy of meat from

285
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,380
down under.

286
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,980
The subsidies, which support this $300 million a year trade, were set to expire in 2023,

287
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,400
but Qatar abruptly announced their end this year.

288
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,160
Some are linking the decision to Australia's criticism of Qatar's treatment of 13 Australian

289
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,280
women earlier this year, who were questionably strip-searched at Doha International Airport.

290
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Qatar says that's not it, and rather it's to bolster their sustainability and independence.

291
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,640
If you're one of those people who are sketched out by large bodies of water and their unknown

292
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,420
contents, this won't provide comfort.

293
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,520
In Lithuania, a team of divers completing a survey for bridge repairs came across the

294
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,800
remains of a 16th-century soldier, including leather boots with spurs, a leather belt with

295
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,160
a buckle, and an iron sword.

296
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,480
Though the current bridge was built in 1934, records indicate there was also one in its

297
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
place 500 years ago.

298
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,240
It's the first underwater remains to be found in Lithuania, and researchers were impressed

299
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,820
by how well-preserved the skeleton was.

300
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:44,600
Know anyone looking for a pet elephant?

301
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,440
Well, Namibia has 170 of them for sale.

302
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,240
That's because, despite the mammal being on the endangered species list, they're

303
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,680
seeing a population rebound in the South African country thanks to successful conservation

304
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,160
measures, jumping from 7,500 in 1995 to 24,000 in 2019.

305
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,520
But, with their growth comes an increase in human-elephant conflict, as well as a fight

306
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,240
for natural resources during a drought year.

307
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,000
Auctioning off some of the pachyderms may alleviate some of the stress and raise funds

308
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
for the country.

309
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,640
President Adamo Barro assumed leadership in the Gambia in 2017 after 22 years of brutal

310
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,560
dictatorship, and at the time he promised to call for new elections after three years,

311
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,080
instead of serving the full five-year term.

312
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,660
Well, guess what?

313
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,480
Now he wants the full five.

314
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,240
Earlier this year, protesters took to the streets to show their disappointment and,

315
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,320
in turn, 137 of them were arrested and dozens more were detained.

316
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,840
For some residents, the show of four seemed like a harkening back to the country's darker

317
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,900
days, and it looks like Barro will be staying in power.

318
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:55,100
The second-largest diamond ever mined was unearthed in 2019, but it caused headlines

319
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,460
this year for its subsequent sale.

320
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:03,020
It wasn't a Diamond House or British Royal that bought the 1,758-carat gem, but French

321
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:07,040
company Louis Vuitton that purchased it from the Caro Mine in Botswana.

322
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,680
The sale isn't only notable because of the price—no numbers have been released but

323
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,000
some estimate around $50 million—but because the buyer is a relative newcomer to the super-high-end

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,760
jewelry market, and this boss move signals they're here to stay.

325
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,280
Scientists in Gabon discovered their own treasure this year, finding the largest pangolin ever

326
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,640
on record, and tagging it for research purposes.

327
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,640
The scaly mammal is thought to be one of the most frequently illegally trafficked animals

328
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,920
in the world, with much of the demand coming from Asia, and researchers are hoping that

329
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,300
by learning about the creature's habits and movements, they'll be better able to

330
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,680
protect it as demand increases for both its meat and bones, which are often used in Chinese

331
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,040
medicine.

332
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,840
Former Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Taman has denied any role in his ex-wife's murder

333
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,320
despite police reports that say he previously paid a $20,000 down payment for her killing,

334
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:01,020
which was part of a $180,000 total sum.

335
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:05,360
His ex-wife was shot in a car two days before his inauguration.

336
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,540
Before that, she rejected getting a divorce so that she could remain the First Lady.

337
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:15,480
He remarried two months after her death, but was forced to resign from power amid the controversy.

338
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,360
North Macedonia, which only became north in 2019 to differ itself from the Greek region

339
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,880
of Macedonia, has the potential to delineate itself through marijuana production too—if

340
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,720
the government will support it.

341
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,000
Though medical marijuana has been legal in the country since 2016, there's a new push

342
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,140
to legalize cannabis in all forms and to ramp up production to supply Western European countries

343
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,780
with pot, where sale and consumption are permitted in modest amounts, but huge grow operations

344
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,780
are not.

345
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,400
Toward the end of 2020, government officials signaled their support to make North Macedonia

346
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,880
a quote, cannabis superpower.

347
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,720
Burning and removing statues has been a thing this year, and a wood depiction of Melania

348
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,840
Trump erected in her hometown of Sejanica, Slovenia was no exception.

349
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:05,360
Someone set fire to the statue in July, so the artist took the reasonable action of replacing

350
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,740
it in more permanent bronze.

351
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,760
That was probably a good idea, since the town of 5,000 residents has seen upwards of 20,000

352
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,500
Melania tourists a year since 2016, when President Trump took office.

353
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,780
Vultures may not be the cutest birds, but they're one the animal kingdom needs for

354
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,420
their scavenger role.

355
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:30,140
Unfortunately, the hooded vulture in Guinea Bissau inched closer to extinction this year,

356
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,940
with the accidental poisoning of more than 1,000 of the birds.

357
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,620
There, residents put strychnine in the landfills to ward off feral dogs, with the unintended

358
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,940
consequence of it being consumed by the scavenging birds.

359
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,320
This actually happens a lot in Africa, and the vulture population across the continent

360
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,760
is highly threatened because of it.

361
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,760
A woman in Latvia made headlines for taking ten days off after her child was born, because

362
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,200
she took it as paternity leave.

363
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,280
Previously, same-sex couples in the country had not been granted the right to both take

364
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,560
parental leave, but she fought the ruling as unconstitutional, and was the first woman

365
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,240
in the country to use her paternity leave.

366
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,760
Arab countries trying to get the attention of Europeans are doing it in perhaps the most

367
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,980
obvious way ever—through soccer, or football, for the rest of the world.

368
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,640
That's why Bahrain purchased a minority stake in football club Paris FC this year,

369
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,660
with a direct goal to attract more Europeans to the Gulf state, which is still feeling

370
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,280
the negative effects of stifling pro-democracy uprisings during the Arab Spring, and is therefore

371
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,060
trying to patch up its global reputation.

372
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,140
We hear a lot about the migration crises of people traveling from Africa to Europe and

373
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:40,900
Central America to the United States, but a movement that gets less coverage is the

374
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,200
one of Venezuelans, many of which go to Trinidad and Tobago.

375
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,780
By late 2020, there were almost 20,000 registered refugees in the island nation, but amid the

376
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,120
ones who made it, there are tragic stories too.

377
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,400
Most recently, 11 Venezuelans, including children, died in a boat trying to cross the Gulf of

378
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:05,200
Paria, which separates Trinidad from the Venezuelan coast by just under 7 miles or 11 kilometers.

379
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,240
When a constitutional referendum passed in Guinea earlier this year that allowed the

380
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,280
president to run for a third term instead of ending at two, it was certainly created

381
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,720
with President Alpha Conde in mind.

382
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,120
There were protests then, and again when he was re-elected in October with nearly 60%

383
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
of a vote.

384
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,000
Since the results, dozens have died in the demonstrations, but that didn't stop him

385
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,440
from being sworn into office earlier this month.

386
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,700
Cyber warfare seems like something that happens in the ether, but American operatives actually

387
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,220
traveled to Estonia prior to the American election in November to learn about the northeastern

388
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,340
European countries' sophisticated defense tactics.

389
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,560
Specifically, the US had Russian hackers in mind, and Estonia has one of the stronger

390
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,540
defense networks because Russia used to test its malware and disinformation campaigns there.

391
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:57,440
A whistleblower from a 2004 case between Australia and East Timor continues to draw attention,

392
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,220
and this year the lawyer for the anonymous whistleblower, referred to as Witness K, won

393
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,500
a free speech prize for his work on the case.

394
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,840
Witness K and lawyer Bernard Coolery revealed that Australia was spying on conversations

395
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,800
between East Timorese officials about oil and gas negotiations in the Timor Sea.

396
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,400
East Timor is one of the poorer countries in the world, and whistleblowing did help

397
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,240
the country get a fairer financial deal.

398
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,720
Mauritius is an Indian Ocean island country that sees 1.3 million visitors each year,

399
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,680
many coming for its lagoons, tropical jungles, and mountains.

400
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,940
But a Japanese oil tanker ran ashore in July spilling 1,000 tons of fuel into the sea,

401
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,820
and since then more than 40 dolphins have washed up on shore.

402
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,880
Some are worried the disaster could extend beyond dying dolphins and severely impact

403
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,380
the country's environment and therefore its primary tourist draw—the pristine nature.

404
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,580
Those who are in are in, but now that Cyprus has shut the door on its golden passport program,

405
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,440
it will be harder for people to buy their way into the European Union.

406
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,420
More than 3,000 foreigners who agreed to invest $2 million each into the country benefited

407
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,820
from this program in its seven-year existence, but new allegations of, and no one could've

408
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,340
guessed this, corruption have led officials to suspend the program.

409
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,740
But that's not to say it wasn't worth it.

410
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:17,300
Cyprus strays $7 billion from it, all told.

411
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:23,040
Eswatini joined an exclusive club this past fall—countries that have consulates to Morocco

412
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,860
in the Western Sahara.

413
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,440
As covered earlier, this is a disputed zone claimed both by Morocco and the Polisario

414
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,040
Front, and many countries choose not to state a strong position on the issue.

415
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,440
With the opening of a consulate to Morocco in the Western Saharan city of Laoun, however,

416
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,040
the Kingdom of Eswatini is firmly positioning itself on Morocco's side, and it becomes

417
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,840
the 15th country to open a consulate to Morocco in the area.

418
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:50,560
Do you remember the chameleon that hadn't been seen for 100 years in Madagascar?

419
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,600
There's another good story like it out of Djibouti, where a mouse-sized elephant shrew

420
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,740
has been seen again for the first time in 50 years.

421
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,700
The good news in this case, unlike with the chameleon, is that the shrew's habitat isn't

422
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:06,660
under threat, so scientists finding 12 animals from the 1000 traps set hopefully means it

423
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,420
won't be another 50 years until they're seen again.

424
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,540
When it comes to sharing good news, Fiji beat out all other countries to become the first

425
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,180
nation to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden on his victory.

426
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,860
Fijian Prime Minister Frank Beni Marama sent out the celebratory tweet before any other

427
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,320
heads of state, but it wasn't purely altruistic.

428
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,200
In the tweet, he called for action on the planet's climate emergency, and asked Biden

429
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:33,960
to bring the United States back into the Paris Agreement.

430
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,060
Think back to the origins of the pandemic, when the world still thought it would be confined

431
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
to China.

432
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:43,520
That's when the tiny island nation of the Comoros got some media attention for giving

433
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,080
China 100 euros as a show of solidarity in fighting the virus.

434
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,160
Of course, few places would be untouched, and it did hit the Comoros in late April,

435
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,540
but ultimately, the Chinese-Comoros relationship is ongoing, as the world's most populated

436
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,480
country continues to invest in the East African island as part of its military and economic

437
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,660
strategy.

438
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,420
Guyana is poised to be one of the world's next big oil producers, but there are some

439
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,100
who aren't happy about that potential.

440
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,740
ExxonMobil found sites that could potentially deliver 8 billion barrels of oil, which could

441
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:20,180
amount to more than $20 billion in revenue for one of South America's poorer countries.

442
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,920
The World Bank has pledged $55 million to help the country in its development, but critics

443
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,560
say this opposes global goals in curbing fossil fuel dependency.

444
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:34,680
China, India, and Bhutan are in ongoing negotiations over their definitive borders—the 25th round

445
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:38,580
of talks was delayed this year because of, well, you know, everything—but that didn't

446
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,600
stop impatient Chinese from constructing and inhabiting a village 1 mile or 1.6 kilometers

447
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,600
within Bhutan's recognized border this year.

448
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:50,660
This territorial grab is something China continues to do, especially to its immediate neighbors

449
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,700
such as Bhutan, which has just under 800,000 residents and poses little threat to the world

450
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,860
and military superpower.

451
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,180
What do China, Iran, North Korea, and the Solomon Islands all have in common?

452
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,360
Well, as of now, it's a Facebook ban.

453
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,740
The South Pacific nation plans to join the three countries in banning the social media

454
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,620
site because, according to officials, citizens are using it to abuse political leaders and

455
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,920
access dangerous information.

456
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,840
Facebook was used as an organizing tool for protests that crippled the nation's capital

457
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,320
last year, and critics of the ban say this is a move to stop criticism of the government.

458
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,760
The United States military is the strongest in the world, and other countries want a piece

459
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
of it.

460
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:40,240
For $36 million, Montenegro was able to buy a taste—67 joint light tactical vehicles.

461
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,720
The agreement is part of a NATO-ally deal that allows such transactions between countries,

462
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,740
and Montenegro is on the United States' friendly list as Western allies try to massage

463
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,280
the region out of its Russian-dominated past.

464
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,420
Looking to ease traffic congestion, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to offer

465
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,860
public transportation entirely for free.

466
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,180
Officials say it could save households roughly $125 per year, and also encourage public transportation

467
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:11,960
use versus private vehicles, which account for 71% of leisure travel and 47% of business.

468
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,220
A new tramway in the country's capital is one attractive alternative for riders.

469
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:20,660
There is an exception, though—first-class passengers will still have to pay.

470
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,500
South America's Suriname is switching gears, with the election of a new president who replaces

471
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:30,280
a dictator-turned-populist running on a poor economic record and a pension for corruption.

472
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:35,640
The new president, Censtantoki, assumes leadership of a country on the brink of financial collapse

473
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,260
and diplomatic disarray.

474
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:41,700
In recent years, the country turned to China and Venezuela for global ties, but Censtantoki

475
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,020
will be tasked in realigning the country with its former imperial power, the Netherlands.

476
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,320
When a Japanese couple on a world tour slash honeymoon were stranded due to pandemic travel

477
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:56,020
bans on the ten tiny islands off the coast of West Africa known as Cape Verde, they settled

478
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,680
in for five months and got to know the locals.

479
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,880
Now, they'll be ambassadors for the country at the upcoming Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

480
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,820
Cape Verde is sending three to four athletes, and though they've never won a medal in

481
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,540
the Summer Games, they will at least be well-represented this time.

482
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,340
Global superpowers continue to fight for strategic power on islands throughout the world, and

483
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,560
this time, the United States has its eyes on the Maldives, where it announced it is

484
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,460
opening an embassy.

485
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,180
The string of 1,100 islands is also in the crosshairs of India and China, which have

486
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,060
financially supported the nation.

487
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,940
China has lent the country millions in infrastructure loans, which the Maldives are finding increasingly

488
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,640
hard to pay back, and that potentially puts them in a debt-trap diplomacy situation.

489
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,060
The US has promised a different approach.

490
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,760
Our favorite nature narrator Sir David Attenborough gifted seven-year-old Prince George a prehistoric

491
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,920
shark tooth that he collected while on family vacation in Malta more than 50 years ago.

492
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,640
Malta did not appreciate the gesture.

493
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:00,080
People said the 23-million-year-old fossil, which likely belonged to a megalodon, should

494
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,840
rightfully find its place among their own country's cultural heritage.

495
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,160
The Maltese eventually formally decided to let it slide this time, opting to avoid making

496
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,400
the young prince cry.

497
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,900
A couple of cases of beer may sound like a party in some countries, but in Brunei, for

498
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,980
a foreigner, it meant getting questioned by police.

499
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:23,280
An Indonesian national was found with 57 beers in his car at a road stop, which was a problem

500
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,460
for him because alcohol is actually illegal in the country.

501
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,200
There is an exception for non-Muslim foreigners, who are allowed to possess up to 12 cans or

502
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,600
2 liters of beer, but he had four times the limit, and that's a party foul.

503
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,920
It appears that fish off the coast of Belize have tamed a shrimp species in the same-ish

504
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,880
way that humans domesticated dogs, at least according to new scientific research.

505
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,080
Apparently, the damselfish aggressively defends a patch of algae against all predators because

506
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,480
that's where it harvests food, but it allows misid shrimp to hang around.

507
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,000
In turn, the shrimp fertilize the algae so it's better food for the damselfish.

508
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,200
After time, the shrimp rely on the fish for protection, and that's domestication.

509
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,180
Exploratory drilling near the Bahamas, and 150 miles or 240 kilometers from the Florida

510
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,720
coast, is set to take place soon, despite opposition from environmental groups and a

511
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,360
ban from the United States on offshore drilling.

512
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,160
That's because the Bahamas Petroleum Company has leases on potential oil fields in the

513
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,720
area, and they're exercising them.

514
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,840
Some are worried about the environmental effects should something go wrong, as has been the

515
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,320
case time and time again, but the Bahamas sees dollar signs that it needs in order to

516
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,640
compensate for the financial hit it took when tourism ground to a halt this year.

517
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,000
Researchers studying islanders in a less tropical part of the world found one interesting, and

518
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,360
potentially evolutionary, trait.

519
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,600
It seems that 2% of Iceland's residents can't smell foul fish—in fact, when presented

520
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:59,280
with the malodorous sample, they pleasantly detected caramel, rose, or potatoes.

521
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,600
These scientific human specimens possess a mutation that turns off their TAAR5 gene—you

522
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,040
know, the one responsible for making a protein that recognizes trimethylamine, aka chemical

523
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,840
found in rotten fish and sometimes human sweat and urine.

524
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,080
Vanuatu is a country that's been hit hard by Mother Nature, having experienced two

525
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,760
volcanic eruptions and two category 5 cyclones in the past five years.

526
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,080
Disaster relief is something officials there are having to learn quickly and execute often.

527
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,780
To do so, one system they've recently implemented is distributing emergency relief funds to

528
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,580
residents via blockchain technology and tap-and-pay cards.

529
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,080
The cards are loaded with money that residents can use immediately, and it avoids some of

530
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:42,160
the red tape that typically consumes relief efforts.

531
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,480
Racial reckoning sparked movements worldwide, and that groundswell did not leave the island

532
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,560
of Barbados untouched.

533
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,560
This most eastern island in the Caribbean formally announced it would remove Queen Elizabeth

534
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,620
as its head of state and become a republic in 2021, citing long-simmering tensions about

535
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,960
the legacy of colonization and racial injustice.

536
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,680
Some see the island's decision to part with the monarchy as a tipping point for neighboring

537
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,700
countries who may also seek their own independence.

538
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,360
To help young women in Sao Tome and Principe, the World Bank announced its commitment of

539
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,160
$15 million to empower young girls.

540
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,360
Providing safe learning spaces in schools is one of the immediate goals of the funding,

541
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,200
where dropping out and pregnancy are common for girls at a young age.

542
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,220
Concurrently, but unrelated to the funding, the country's National Olympic Committee

543
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,880
announced a push to encourage girls aged 6 to 18 into surfing lessons—another way to

544
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,120
steer young women into positive alternatives, and potentially build their summer Olympics

545
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,120
team.

546
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,080
Samoa's state-owned flag carrier Samoa Airways was reporting financial trouble at a loss

547
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:47,360
of $25 million in 2019, according to reports.

548
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,200
That was before this year, and the decimation of passenger demand, and so it's not looking

549
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,780
any better for them.

550
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,740
The airline also reportedly owes $11 million to creditors, but of course, executives are

551
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,780
painting a rosier picture.

552
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:05,480
This all comes as Samoa Airways tries to complete its lease negotiations for a Boeing 737-800

553
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,680
from the Netherlands, and further debt could hinder those.

554
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,600
When it comes to the world's top honeymoon destination, there's one place that keeps

555
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:19,760
blowing every other location out of international waters, so to speak—Saint Lucia.

556
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,000
The Caribbean island was named the number one honeymoon locale for the 12th time and

557
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
third consecutive year.

558
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,720
The World Travel Awards were announced virtually in Moscow this year, and hopefully, by this

559
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,760
time next year, people won't have to take a virtual honeymoon to Saint Lucia.

560
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,880
This change is impacting all islands, including the 32 atolls that comprise the nation of

561
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,880
Kiribati.

562
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,160
That's why President Tenati Maumau will accept funding from China to dredge sand along

563
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,160
the most populous islands to actually raise them out of the sea.

564
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,560
Some see this as a strategic play by China, to inch further into the Pacific Ocean, where

565
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,720
military presence closer to the United States would certainly be a power move.

566
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,320
Maumau, however, says Kiribati would not grant China the gift of building a base on its nearby

567
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,480
Christmas Island, which just happens to be relatively close to Hawaii.

568
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,000
The Federated States of Micronesia are composed of more than 600 islands stretching 1,600

569
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
miles or 2,700 kilometers across the Pacific Ocean.

570
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,800
The country's population is quite small in comparison to the vastness that gives it

571
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,480
the 14th largest exclusive economic zone in the world.

572
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,160
This is what makes the rescue of three stranded men who wrote SOS in the sand on a deserted

573
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,600
atoll most impressive.

574
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,800
They'd run out of fuel and drifted 118 miles or 190 kilometers west of their departure

575
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,980
point, and were spotted by a search plane three days after their departure.

576
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,940
Another stranded island story transports us to Grenada, where a British woman visiting

577
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:50,240
the Caribbean island found herself stuck thanks to the spring's travel bans.

578
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,500
The problem is that she was six months pregnant, and ended up delivering her child on the island

579
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,760
prematurely.

580
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,040
She ended up securing a repatriation flight in June, becoming one of tens of thousands

581
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,680
of British who were chartered back from at least 57 countries.

582
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,960
We're getting to the smaller countries, and most of them are islands.

583
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:13,600
During 2015, a 30-mile, 50-kilometer algal bloom made a slow water surface crawl into

584
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,520
the Pacific, and scientists were baffled by what caused it, until a report was released

585
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,640
this year.

586
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,700
The patch was created by Tonga Island runoff, rich in iron and phosphorus.

587
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:30,200
This is common, but its delayed appearance is not, and that's what confused scientists.

588
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,440
It took some time for a nitrogen fixer to utilize the nutrients, making it seem like

589
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,840
the bloom came out of nowhere when it had actually slow-cooked its way across the ocean.

590
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,780
Travel between Ukraine and St. Vincent and the Grenadines became easier following the

591
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:47,480
signing of a visa-free travel agreement between the two countries.

592
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,660
The Caribbean country is part of the Commonwealth of Nations, a political association of 54

593
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,000
members, nearly all former territories of the British Empire.

594
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,520
Ukraine has its eyes on some of the more powerful Commonwealth members granting visa-free travel,

595
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,800
or at least the ambassador tweeted an allusion to that, with Australia, the UK, and Canada

596
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,040
on his wishlist.

597
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,360
It's been 44 years since the Seychelles secured its independence from Britain, and

598
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:14,860
this year marked the first time that a president from the opposition party won an election

599
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,800
since the country's British breakaway.

600
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:21,300
That's being heralded as a step towards greater democracy, with Wavell Ram Calawan

601
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:27,140
defeating an incumbent from the United Seychelles Party, which had been in power since 1977.

602
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,020
British sailor and 72-year-old man Graham Walters was super social distancing when he

603
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,420
sailed from Great Britain to Antigua, setting the record for the oldest person to cross

604
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,900
the Atlantic Ocean solo.

605
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,580
It was actually his fifth trip across the ocean, and he nearly went awry at the end

606
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,980
when strong winds blew him 6 miles or 10 kilometers off course of Antigua.

607
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,860
He was able to call the Coast Guard and get a tow to his final destination, and officials

608
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,800
still counted it as a world record even with the assist.

609
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,800
One of the tiniest European countries, Andorra, joined the big guns and became the 190th nation

610
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,560
to become a part of the International Monetary Fund.

611
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,840
But why now?

612
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:09,280
Well, crisis financing mostly, which the IMF comes through on for countries in need, among

613
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
other missions.

614
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,260
Trade and tourism—mostly ski resorts and hiking trails—contribute to 40% of the mountainous

615
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,900
country's economy, and they're hurting right now with a lack thereof.

616
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,580
A Caribbean island that's counting on tourism and the economy bouncing back is Dominica.

617
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:28,320
It announced its intentions to build a new long-haul airport, capitalizing on a growing

618
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,020
eco-tourism and offshore financial sector.

619
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,660
Currently, visitors must transfer to Dominica through a neighboring island, but this new

620
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:39,060
airport would make direct trips from the United States, United Kingdom, and Western Europe

621
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,420
more possible.

622
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,560
Officials say it will be largely financed by foreigners who pay in exchange for a passport,

623
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,960
but it seems that we've heard this story before.

624
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,820
What drifts away from the coast of Mexico likely ends up at the Marshall Islands, according

625
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,520
to computer simulations.

626
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,840
In this case, it was a boat full of cocaine.

627
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Without any evidence or leads, law enforcement officials have theorized that a boat filled

628
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,660
with 1,430 pounds or 650 kilograms of the illegal drug came from the Mexican or Central

629
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,260
American coast, and it had probably been floating captainless for at least a year.

630
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:15,540
Though drugs have washed up onshore before, this was the largest ever haul, and it was

631
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,620
quickly incinerated.

632
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,260
It seems that Caribbean islands are all vying for new citizens, and the influx of money

633
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
they bring.

634
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,180
Saint Kitts and Nevis has made the process so easy that wealthy investors can get citizenship

635
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,760
in under 60 days—one of the fastest tracks in the world—without even having to step

636
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,800
foot in the country, and for that they've been recognized by the Financial Times for

637
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,280
having one of the best citizen-by-investment programs.

638
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:46,060
For $150,000, a family of four can call Saint Kitts their second, or third, or fourth home.

639
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:50,560
Sir Jim Ratcliffe is another wealthy individual moving to sunnier skies—he's leaving the

640
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,440
United Kingdom for Monaco, where he'll save up to $5.4 billion in taxes.

641
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,760
Ratcliffe is a petrochemicals magnate with an estimated worth of $23.6 billion.

642
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,680
People who live in Monaco for at least 183 days a year don't pay income or property

643
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,720
taxes, and that's a lot different from the up to 45% he could be paying under the UK's

644
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,360
tax system.

645
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:19,600
Sandwiched between Austria and Switzerland, Liechtenstein said no to developing an international

646
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,680
rail system.

647
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,320
The country is only 15 miles or 25 kilometers long, and has just one domestic track.

648
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,940
This initiative would have widened it and upgraded one of the terminals so that international

649
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,100
trains could stop there, but voters turned down the project at the polls—balking at

650
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,820
the $73.5 million price tag.

651
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:42,500
With a 6pm curfew in Italy due to lockdowns, residents looking for a little nightlife are

652
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,400
hopping the border into San Marino, where bars and restaurants are open until 10pm.

653
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:51,460
The small, independent country is just ten minutes from cities such as Raimini, and Italian

654
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,460
officials are frustrated that by San Marino not falling in line with their own guidelines,

655
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,820
they're putting more citizens at risk of spreading the virus.

656
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,980
Palau, about 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometers from the Philippines, has a free association

657
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,580
agreement with the United States that delivers significant financial aid, and gives Palauans

658
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:12,820
the right to travel to, live, and work in the US.

659
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,500
But that current compact expires in 2024, and Palau wants even more US presence.

660
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,540
They've invited America to build a military base on their island.

661
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:27,340
Currently, Palau has no military, and they see an American base there as a way to bolster

662
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,340
security, and for the United States, it's a way to push back against growing Chinese

663
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,240
influence in the region.

664
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:38,220
The Perth Mint in Australia produces Tuvalu's currency, including the Tuvalu dollar, which

665
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:42,580
is used alongside the Australian dollar and a series of collectible coins.

666
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,660
This year, Tuvalu issued a coin of American film star John Wayne that has been selling

667
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,780
for more than $100.

668
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:53,060
It turns out, the collectible coin business is quite lucrative for the tiny island, which

669
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:57,020
receives about $200,000 a year in royalties.

670
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,880
The coins are technically legal tender, but more so they're purchased by international

671
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,100
collectors.

672
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:07,740
Australia uses the tiny Micronesian island of Nauru as an outpost for refugees to spend

673
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,020
time while their claims are processed.

674
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:14,380
In combination with Papua New Guinea, where detainees are also kept, there are about 300

675
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:19,700
people held, but Australia spent $1.2 billion this financial year to keep them there, equally

676
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,100
about $4 million per person.

677
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,760
This is causing many to turn their heads at the exorbitant cost that would be better spent

678
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,200
just keeping those refugees in Australia.

679
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,760
On top of that, conditions in the refugee camps are poor and sometimes dangerous, so

680
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,980
the money has not been well spent.

681
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:39,700
And here we are, the world's smallest country, the Vatican City.

682
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:45,560
This year has a very 2020 story—Catholicism's headquarters may have missed the mark on the

683
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,820
nativity scene.

684
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:51,400
Each year, the Holy City produces a new scene donated by an Italian city.

685
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,660
This year Castelli, a town known for ceramics, got the spotlight, but the curious stylings

686
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,660
of coiled clay-meat astronauts have received curious reviews.

687
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:03,740
Castellians made the figures over decades, and they've survived natural disasters and

688
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,740
more.

689
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,120
One observer saw hope in the scene—quote, it's a nativity scene that has had problems

690
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,700
like we've all had in a lousy year, she said.

691
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,340
If it made it, we can.

692
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,340
And that's it.

693
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:19,220
That's the news you missed in 2020, or at least some of it, from every country in the

694
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,220
world.

695
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,140
If you've made it to this point, you're clearly a lover of learning about the world.

696
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:28,020
Therefore, I'm going to recommend you an audiobook from our sponsor, Audible, that

697
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,360
would honestly be stunned if someone who made it through all 195 countries has not already

698
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
listened to.

699
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:38,220
It's Prisoners of Geography, by Tim Marshall, which is this fascinating read about how geography

700
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,420
constrains countries.

701
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,240
It explains things like why Putin is so focused on Crimea, why Europe will never be united,

702
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,940
and why the US was destined to become a superpower.

703
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,620
You can actually listen to this completely for free by signing up for a free trial to
