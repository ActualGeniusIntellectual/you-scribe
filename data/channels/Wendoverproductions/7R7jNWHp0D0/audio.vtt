00:00.000 --> 00:05.500
Welcome back to the news you missed in 2020 from every country in the world.

00:05.500 --> 00:09.960
If you haven't yet seen part one, make sure you go and watch that first—unless, of course,

00:09.960 --> 00:13.600
you only care about the small countries, because we'll start with one with a rather petite

00:13.600 --> 00:17.780
population of just eight and a half million.

00:17.780 --> 00:21.840
An eight-year-old boy who tried to use spirit money—fake bills used in China as spiritual

00:21.840 --> 00:26.360
offerings—at a grocery store in Switzerland didn't get Monopoly's go-to-jail card,

00:26.360 --> 00:29.920
but he did get a mugshot and now has a police record.

00:29.920 --> 00:34.080
The heavy-handed punishment for using counterfeit money surprised residents because of the boy's

00:34.080 --> 00:38.400
age and presumed naivete, and caused some embarrassment for the country, which discussed

00:38.400 --> 00:40.840
the case openly in Parliament.

00:40.840 --> 00:47.440
Chevron's $4 billion acquisition of Texas-based Noble Energy was an American transaction,

00:47.440 --> 00:49.000
but was rooted in Israel.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.880
That's because Noble Energy has built a large natural gas business in and around Israeli

00:53.880 --> 00:58.440
waters, and the purchase essentially opens up the country to energy development—a nation

00:58.440 --> 01:02.320
that had remained virtually untouched to such activities in order to maintain political

01:02.320 --> 01:05.420
stability with Arab oil-producing countries.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.480
Not only does the deal unlock the potential for a brand new resource economy, but it demonstrates

01:10.480 --> 01:15.800
that the Persian Gulf may now be more accepting of Israeli business.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.360
Togo became the first country in Africa to eliminate sleeping sickness—a sometimes

01:20.360 --> 01:26.400
fatal parasitic infection transmitted by flies, found primarily in rural areas in 36 African

01:26.400 --> 01:27.400
countries.

01:27.400 --> 01:32.000
After more than two decades of dedicated public health measures, the West African country

01:32.000 --> 01:37.640
eliminated the illness, which causes fever, aches, and, most commonly, disrupts a person's

01:37.640 --> 01:38.640
sleep.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.340
The good news is that cases are also dropping throughout Africa, and the number of people

01:42.340 --> 01:47.260
dying has dropped 90% since the early 90s, when the annual death toll reached a peak

01:47.260 --> 01:49.420
of 34,000.

01:49.420 --> 01:53.340
Some more good news out of Africa is that girls and young women who are pregnant in

01:53.340 --> 01:56.880
Sierra Leone are no longer banned from attending school.

01:56.880 --> 02:01.480
Previously, once pregnant, young women were not allowed to finish school or take their

02:01.480 --> 02:06.060
exams, but this decision is a victory for feminism in the country, and will allow tens

02:06.060 --> 02:09.720
of thousands of young women to potentially complete their education and provide them

02:09.720 --> 02:12.660
with more opportunity in life.

02:12.660 --> 02:17.960
The crater of a meteorite that hit Earth 800,000 years ago, blasting glass particles known

02:17.960 --> 02:23.720
as tektites to over 10% of the planet, has gone unfound… until now.

02:23.720 --> 02:28.260
Researchers think they have located the impact crater, stretching 11 miles or 17 kilometers

02:28.260 --> 02:33.160
long by 8 miles or 13 kilometers wide and filled with about 300 feet or 90 meters of

02:33.160 --> 02:36.040
rock, on a plateau in Laos.

02:36.040 --> 02:40.760
Though a crater like this should have presented itself through erosion over eons, this elusive

02:40.760 --> 02:46.240
hole was covered by more than 1,000 feet or 300 meters of lava flow, and was only discovered

02:46.240 --> 02:50.280
on a hillside after it was carved out to pave a road.

02:50.280 --> 02:55.000
Brazilian World Cup football star Ronaldinho spent the past six months in a Paraguayan

02:55.000 --> 02:59.460
jail and house arrest for entering the country in March on an illegal passport.

02:59.460 --> 03:03.760
The star player spent more than a month behind bars, and was then transported to a luxury

03:03.760 --> 03:08.420
hotel and held there for another four months, while his legal troubles were sorted out between

03:08.420 --> 03:09.480
the governments.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.060
He says he didn't know the passport was fake.

03:12.060 --> 03:16.160
During the latter part, he reportedly had parties in San Cariocchi, leading people to

03:16.160 --> 03:19.700
wonder if prison is really that bad.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.740
Speaking of fake passports and punishment, Raya, a three-month-old Chihuahua, was facing

03:24.740 --> 03:29.460
euthanasia for traveling from her home country of Bulgaria to Norway, where she'd been

03:29.460 --> 03:35.300
adopted, on a falsified passport, until action star Jean-Claude Van Damme stepped in, and

03:35.300 --> 03:37.020
you can't make this stuff up.

03:37.020 --> 03:41.340
Bulgaria initially refused to take the dog back, until Van Damme took to social media,

03:41.340 --> 03:47.180
and the country capitulated, eventually repatriating her and putting her up for adoption again.

03:47.340 --> 03:50.580
Remember that story about Israel, natural gas, and the Mediterranean Sea?

03:50.580 --> 03:54.140
We're back to it, but this time with Lebanon involved.

03:54.140 --> 03:58.100
The two countries started mediation for the first time in 30 years over part of the sea

03:58.100 --> 04:01.360
because of their dual interest in energy development.

04:01.360 --> 04:07.300
Both say that a 330-square-mile, 850-square-kilometer area of the sea is part of their exclusive

04:07.300 --> 04:08.580
economic zone.

04:08.580 --> 04:13.420
The two have been essentially at a standstill for decades, and even though they had to communicate

04:13.420 --> 04:18.420
through mediators from the United States, their meeting marked a historic moment.

04:18.420 --> 04:22.780
More mediation in the Middle East actually took place in the United Nations in Geneva,

04:22.780 --> 04:27.540
but it led to a ceasefire between the two main warring factions in Africa's Libya.

04:27.540 --> 04:31.980
The two sides have been engaged in a bloody battle for years, and this newest peace attempt

04:31.980 --> 04:35.980
brings some hope to both the country and to nearby nations that have previously tried

04:35.980 --> 04:39.080
to intervene, such as Russia and Turkey.

04:39.080 --> 04:43.740
As Nicaragua continues to develop its natural resources, reports show that it may be doing

04:43.740 --> 04:46.800
it at the cost of indigenous people's lives.

04:46.800 --> 04:51.060
The government is actively promoting illegal land grabs for timber and mining companies,

04:51.060 --> 04:54.840
and there have been reports that more than 40 native people have been killed, though

04:54.840 --> 04:56.640
the police refuse to investigate.

04:56.640 --> 05:01.000
It's all the more complicated by the fact that President Daniel Ortega has family ties

05:01.000 --> 05:05.660
to one of the most active timber companies working in the protected area.

05:05.660 --> 05:10.960
Up the coast, Guatemala offered El Salvador the opportunity to build a port on its lands

05:10.960 --> 05:16.300
and waters, giving Atlantic Ocean access to El Salvador, whose coastline is only on the

05:16.300 --> 05:17.300
Pacific.

05:17.300 --> 05:21.940
In its initial phases, the port will likely be constructed through a private-public partnership

05:21.940 --> 05:27.500
and infrastructure, such as hotels and warehouses, would be built around the port as well, bringing

05:27.500 --> 05:31.620
a significant El Salvadorian presence to its neighboring country.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.020
Alright, try to keep up with this one.

05:34.020 --> 05:39.340
In Kyrgyzstan, Central Asia's only democracy, the President resigned after a week in hiding,

05:39.340 --> 05:41.060
following a tumultuous election.

05:41.060 --> 05:46.220
A few hours before his announcement, President Genbakov said he would not step down amid

05:46.220 --> 05:51.300
the disputed election, but then he did and it left some wondering if his quick about-face

05:51.300 --> 05:55.100
was triggered by threats of violence from a criminal-backed group.

05:55.100 --> 06:00.280
The new leader is a former kidnapper who was sprung from jail by anti-government protesters

06:00.280 --> 06:04.800
at the same time as Genbakov's resignation, raising many eyebrows.

06:04.800 --> 06:10.160
Nearby, the President of Turkmenistan is widely known for his obsession with a breed of dog

06:10.160 --> 06:11.520
called the Alibi.

06:11.520 --> 06:17.240
So, it didn't come as a surprise that he erected a 19-foot, 6-meter-old statue of the

06:17.240 --> 06:21.280
shepherd-like canine in a traffic circle in the country's capital.

06:21.280 --> 06:25.920
Turkmenistan is also known to have one of the world's more repressive governments,

06:25.920 --> 06:29.460
and doesn't even allow human rights organizations into the country.

06:29.460 --> 06:34.180
That creates a definite disconnect in terms of humanizing animals, but treating humans

06:34.180 --> 06:36.580
inhumanely.

06:36.580 --> 06:41.060
Investors and entrepreneurs have keyed in on a new use for Australia's desolate and

06:41.060 --> 06:46.060
unforgiving outback—turn it into a solar farm large enough to power the country of

06:46.060 --> 06:47.060
Singapore.

06:47.060 --> 06:52.700
Sun Cable has announced a $90 billion, 10 gigawatt, 30,000-acre solar farm that will

06:52.700 --> 06:58.460
send about two-thirds of the energy it produces north through undersea high-voltage cables.

06:58.460 --> 07:04.060
If all goes right, the lights of Singapore could be solar-powered by 2027.

07:04.060 --> 07:08.620
In another part of the global movement to cleaner energy, Denmark, the European Union's

07:08.620 --> 07:13.260
largest oil producer, announced it would end all oil and gas exploration in the North Sea

07:13.260 --> 07:17.300
as part of its commitment to phase out fossil fuel extraction by 2050.

07:17.300 --> 07:23.380
Its existing 55 platforms, spread across 20 oil and gas fields, will continue operations,

07:23.380 --> 07:27.620
but the decision to stop looking for more sends a powerful message to the world about

07:27.620 --> 07:32.300
the future of energy, and this country's goal is to be a green leader.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.900
Some of the world may be saying goodbye to fossil fuels, but an animal that oddly turns

07:36.900 --> 07:41.660
out to like gas-powered vehicles, or at least their sounds, is a monkey.

07:41.660 --> 07:47.180
A zoo in Finland gave their white-faced saki monkeys a choice between the sounds of traffic,

07:47.180 --> 07:52.100
the jungle, zen, or dance music, and the primates overwhelmingly preferred honking cars and

07:52.100 --> 07:56.500
screeching tires over the mimicry of their natural habitat.

07:56.500 --> 08:00.960
When Slovakian President Zuzana Kaputova learned that Chinese telecom giant Huawei

08:00.960 --> 08:05.220
was the sponsor for a defense conference at which she was slated to speak, she quickly

08:05.220 --> 08:07.860
pressed end call and cancelled her talk.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.260
She cited security risks, along with following her basic principles, since Huawei has been

08:12.260 --> 08:14.100
accused of foreign interference.

08:14.100 --> 08:19.020
Huawei eventually backed out of the conference, and Kaputova ended up taking the stage, but

08:19.020 --> 08:22.460
the message was heard loud and clear.

08:22.460 --> 08:27.060
The World Wildlife Foundation has been working for more than a decade to set up a national

08:27.060 --> 08:32.020
park and nature reserve in the Republic of the Congo, however, this year, the European

08:32.020 --> 08:36.620
Union pulled their funding upon reports that the anti-poaching guards patrolling the proposed

08:36.620 --> 08:41.540
park have been engaging in physical violence against the indigenous people of the area,

08:41.540 --> 08:45.060
and are restricting them from moving around on their own land.

08:45.060 --> 08:49.260
The World Wildlife Foundation's application for EU funding specifically stated that the

08:49.260 --> 08:53.700
indigenous people of the area were for the project, but given that that either no longer

08:53.700 --> 08:59.200
or was never true, it's unclear whether this project will move forward.

08:59.200 --> 09:04.220
Only three countries still allow commercial whaling, and Norway is one of them.

09:04.220 --> 09:08.740
Typically, the Scandinavian country sends most of its whale meat to Japan, where demand

09:08.740 --> 09:13.700
is high, but Norwegians are opting to consume more of the meat for the first time in years,

09:13.700 --> 09:17.980
which is probably due to the growing movement against traditionally processed meat in favor

09:17.980 --> 09:23.300
of locally sourced products, like the mink whales they hunt in their own waters.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.100
Close your eyes if you don't want to see something bizarre.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.740
It's the wrinkle-faced bat native to Costa Rica.

09:30.740 --> 09:34.720
But of course, what one sees as ugly, others find sexy?

09:34.720 --> 09:39.720
New research this year found that these elusive jungle dwellers mate in an interesting way.

09:39.720 --> 09:44.500
The males congregate in big groups, perform a routine, and fold some of the extra skin

09:44.500 --> 09:51.020
around their face up like a neck gaiter to seduce the females—and it seems to work.

09:51.020 --> 09:55.300
Three Palestinian peace activists who held a Zoom call with Israelis that included more

09:55.300 --> 10:01.220
than 200 participants and viewers were charged with quote, weakening revolutionary spirit.

10:01.220 --> 10:05.580
Their goal was part of a bridge-building initiative called Skype with Your Enemy, but according

10:05.580 --> 10:10.440
to Palestinian officials, communication with Israel is considered a quote, normalization

10:10.440 --> 10:12.240
activity and punishable.

10:12.240 --> 10:17.360
The three could face years in prison and hard labor sentences.

10:17.360 --> 10:22.120
The Arab world's longest-serving ruler, the Sultan of Oman, died this year at the

10:22.120 --> 10:24.080
age of 79.

10:24.080 --> 10:28.860
Since he had no children, his cousin was chosen to replace him, ending years of speculation

10:28.860 --> 10:33.320
on which of the more than 80 potential successors would gain the spot.

10:33.320 --> 10:38.120
Upon his passing, the Sultan was recognized for his steadfast, diplomatic reign by other

10:38.120 --> 10:39.640
world leaders.

10:39.640 --> 10:44.060
This is a seemingly peaceful story about a leadership change, amid a flurry of headlines

10:44.060 --> 10:46.560
this year that were quite the opposite.

10:46.560 --> 10:51.260
It's easier to get to Liberia from France, as well as other western destinations, now

10:51.260 --> 10:56.320
that Air France resumed its flight from Paris to Monrovia after a nine-year hiatus.

10:56.320 --> 11:01.200
The direct flight debuted on an Airbus A350, which landed at a newly refurbished Robert

11:01.200 --> 11:03.660
International Airport in Liberia.

11:03.660 --> 11:07.240
Officials boasted about the newly improved connections between the United States, United

11:07.240 --> 11:12.060
Kingdom, India, and China with the return of this flight, and, naturally, the strengthened

11:12.060 --> 11:15.120
ties between Liberia and France.

11:15.120 --> 11:19.880
When visitors to the North Pole buried a time capsule there in 2018, they thought it would

11:19.880 --> 11:24.820
be 40 years until it was discovered, but, because of climate change and the fast-melting

11:24.820 --> 11:27.920
Arctic, the artifacts were found much sooner.

11:27.920 --> 11:33.720
They washed up on the shores of Ireland this year, some 2,300 miles or 3,700 kilometers

11:33.720 --> 11:34.720
away.

11:34.720 --> 11:38.440
That's obviously another bad sign for the Arctic, which some scientists say will be

11:38.440 --> 11:42.520
ice-free by the summer of 2035.

11:42.520 --> 11:47.780
Last year, a volcano on New Zealand's White Island erupted and killed 22 people, including

11:47.780 --> 11:51.200
children and seniors, who were there with tour groups.

11:51.200 --> 11:55.880
Now, 13 parties have been charged in their deaths, with lawsuits claiming negligence

11:55.880 --> 11:59.160
for allowing people to visit the site of an active volcano.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.700
A family owns the island, and tours were run by a small group of operators, but the island

12:03.700 --> 12:06.980
has been closed to visitors ever since.

12:06.980 --> 12:11.620
A Sudanese militia leader who had been on the run for 13 years was arrested in a remote

12:11.620 --> 12:16.340
corner of the Central African Republic, near the border with Sudan, which is where he allegedly

12:16.340 --> 12:21.080
carried out crimes against humanity, including mass campaigns of murder, rape, and looting

12:21.080 --> 12:27.100
in the early 2000s, which partially contributed to a humanitarian crisis in which 300,000

12:27.100 --> 12:30.640
people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.

12:30.640 --> 12:34.920
His arrest and subsequent trial at The Hague will potentially bring justice to many who

12:34.920 --> 12:37.420
have suffered in Darfur.

12:37.420 --> 12:42.520
For several months, Mauritania banned Senegal from fishing in its waters because of illegal,

12:42.520 --> 12:48.320
unreported, and unregulated fishing, which they say cost their country up to $300 million

12:48.320 --> 12:49.440
in lost revenue.

12:49.440 --> 12:54.640
Now, under the new agreement, Senegal will pay Mauritania for the actual fish it catches,

12:54.640 --> 12:58.040
which means no more punitive fines for the country instead.

12:58.040 --> 13:02.240
This seems like a win-win for the two West African countries, and demonstrates some progress

13:02.240 --> 13:06.540
towards countries all happily sharing the same pond.

13:06.540 --> 13:11.480
In 2016, the Panama Papers exposed how some of the world's most prominent politicians,

13:11.480 --> 13:15.540
business leaders, and celebrities set up offshore bank accounts to conceal their wealth and

13:15.540 --> 13:18.240
avoid taxes in the Central American country.

13:18.240 --> 13:21.500
So, of course, Netflix made a movie about it.

13:21.500 --> 13:27.280
But now, the law firm behind the 11.5 million documents is not happy about their portrayal

13:27.280 --> 13:31.960
as quote, ruthless, uncaring, and unethical lawyers, so they're doing the most lawyer

13:31.960 --> 13:34.760
thing possible and suing Netflix.

13:34.760 --> 13:40.280
Jurgen Mossack and Ramon Fonseca are claiming defamation and asks Netflix to cease streaming

13:40.280 --> 13:44.680
The Laundromat, though it's already been screened to crowds at European film festivals.

13:44.680 --> 13:49.840
Readers, writers, and free speech advocates are rejoicing now that officials in Kuwait

13:49.840 --> 13:54.540
disbanded a committee that banned more than 5,000 books over seven years.

13:54.540 --> 13:58.900
The country's Ministry of Information will no longer have the control to censor titles

13:58.900 --> 14:03.700
like Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame and 100 Years of Solitude by Gabrielle

14:03.700 --> 14:05.500
Garcia Marquez.

14:05.500 --> 14:10.600
But besides banning book imports, the committee also had a say over every title that was published

14:10.600 --> 14:11.660
in the country.

14:11.660 --> 14:15.420
Now they don't, and that means the words should flow more freely.

14:15.420 --> 14:19.660
Here's a tip—if you're German but wanted in the United States for building software

14:19.660 --> 14:23.900
that tricks automobile emissions inspectors, then don't cross from Germany, where you're

14:23.900 --> 14:26.580
elected, into Croatia, where you're not.

14:26.580 --> 14:30.800
Apparently, former Volkswagen executive Alex Eiser didn't get the memo that only his

14:30.800 --> 14:33.900
native country doesn't extradite its own citizens.

14:33.900 --> 14:37.500
He was arrested when crossing the border in June, and will likely be charged in the United

14:37.500 --> 14:41.380
States since America and Croatia signed an extradition treaty last year.

14:41.380 --> 14:45.520
He's at the center of the emissions scandal in which the German auto manufacturer tried

14:45.520 --> 14:50.220
to evade US Clean Air Act laws by tricking the system, and his arrest shows that the

14:50.220 --> 14:54.380
United States isn't finished with its car chase yet.

14:54.380 --> 14:59.460
Moldova is veering away from its Putin-leaning ways, at least temporarily, with its election

14:59.460 --> 15:05.580
of Maia Sandu, a pro-Western, Harvard-educated former prime minister, and its ouster of incumbent

15:05.580 --> 15:08.500
pro-Russian president Igor Dodonu.

15:08.500 --> 15:12.940
Besides favoring European ties, Sandu is also the country's first woman president.

15:12.940 --> 15:16.820
She ran on an anti-corruption platform and championed embracing the country's Romanian

15:16.820 --> 15:21.700
roots—as 75 of the countries speaks Romanian—over its ties to Russia.

15:21.700 --> 15:26.160
Tiny Moldova is sandwiched between Ukraine and Romania, which have also leaned more Russian

15:26.160 --> 15:31.060
in recent years, and the results demonstrate this region's increased shift away from

15:31.060 --> 15:32.060
Russia.

15:32.060 --> 15:35.980
If you're tired of hearing about Georgia, the US state, you can opt to move to the Eastern

15:35.980 --> 15:40.040
European country of the same name to escape the 24-7 news.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.660
The nation recently announced a visa-free entry program, called Remotely from Georgia,

15:44.660 --> 15:48.400
that grants year-long stays to nationals from 95 countries.

15:48.400 --> 15:52.700
There are some caveats—transplants must earn at least $2,000 per month and have health

15:52.700 --> 15:57.100
insurance—meaning the country is looking for a certain type of more permanent visitor—one

15:57.100 --> 16:00.840
that has money and can contribute to its faltering economy.

16:00.840 --> 16:05.100
The European Union is being held accountable for the way it funds projects in Africa, thanks

16:05.100 --> 16:07.700
to a group of air-trains in the Netherlands.

16:07.700 --> 16:12.080
They allege that the EU is paying for forced labor by funding heavy construction equipment

16:12.080 --> 16:16.480
to open and pave a road that connects the Ethiopia-Eritrea border with the Eritrean

16:16.480 --> 16:18.020
port of Massawa.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.200
That equipment is apparently being run by conscripts.

16:21.200 --> 16:26.420
The project is part of a $6 billion injection from the EU into Africa as a way to curb migration

16:26.420 --> 16:32.400
from south to north, but this case shows that more oversight is needed in the process.

16:32.400 --> 16:36.640
Another immigration story centers around a steady stream of Argentinians relocating to

16:36.640 --> 16:40.200
Uruguay—a move that the latter is quite happy about.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.040
Uruguay enticed residents from its southern neighbor by lowering the minimum value of

16:44.040 --> 16:51.000
property required for tax residency from $1.7 million to $380,000, and by offering a 10-year

16:51.000 --> 16:52.200
tax holiday.

16:52.200 --> 16:57.620
That, in turn, has led close to 20,000 people to flock north this year—a number equivalent

16:57.620 --> 17:03.560
to about 0.6% of Uruguay's population of 3.5 million—meaning the great pandemic migration

17:03.560 --> 17:05.680
continues.

17:05.680 --> 17:10.340
Also signaling that Bosnia-Herzegovina is next on the luxury destination list, Saudi

17:10.340 --> 17:15.680
developer Dar Al Arkan announced this year it would build a 5 million square foot residential

17:15.680 --> 17:20.320
and hotel complex outside of Sarajevo, making it the largest real estate project in the

17:20.320 --> 17:21.780
country's history.

17:21.780 --> 17:25.880
This addition is being touted as a second home community that will attract both Bosnian

17:25.880 --> 17:30.500
and international visitors, and expand the developer's global footprint.

17:30.500 --> 17:34.840
When much of the world was brought to a standstill, a Mongolian cuckoo made its most epic journey

17:34.840 --> 17:41.200
yet—an 8,000 mile, 13,000 kilometer return trip from South Africa to Mongolia, completing

17:41.200 --> 17:46.360
a round-trip journey that's one of the longest ever recorded for a land bird.

17:46.360 --> 17:50.820
Scientists tracked the bird using a GPS tag to study its habits, and were frankly surprised

17:50.820 --> 17:54.040
it survived the year away and 27 border crossings.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.260
Though long-distance birds aren't revelatory, the lengths to which this species went are

17:58.260 --> 18:04.480
notable and perhaps poses more questions than answers such as, why go so far?

18:04.480 --> 18:09.840
The Armenia-Azerbaijan War populated headlines this fall, but notably absent from those stories

18:09.840 --> 18:12.880
were the United States' involvement in the conflict.

18:12.880 --> 18:17.020
Prior to the Trump administration, the United States actively engaged in previous peace

18:17.020 --> 18:20.840
negotiations in the region, but the America First doctrine that dominates the current

18:20.840 --> 18:24.260
administration led to diplomatic disengagement there.

18:24.260 --> 18:28.280
That said, the two countries still agreed to a ceasefire, which has already been tested

18:28.280 --> 18:32.660
and broken, according to Russian peacekeepers, and now we'll see if the Biden administration

18:32.660 --> 18:35.480
plans to become more involved.

18:35.480 --> 18:40.400
Move over rum, Jamaica is looking to a new economic driver—bamboo.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.560
The government announced efforts to boost bamboo production on the island nation, which

18:44.560 --> 18:47.900
it sees as a more sustainable revenue source.

18:47.900 --> 18:52.300
Bamboo is a quick-growing plant that can be used as an alternative to traditional wood

18:52.300 --> 18:54.900
products in tissues, paper, and cloth.

18:54.900 --> 18:59.740
Caribbean island nations are, in some cases, pushing for greener futures out of necessity—in

18:59.740 --> 19:05.120
2019, Jamaica banned plastic bags and styrofoam—and also opportunity.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.980
The EU's getting a lot of attention, and this time it's because North Macedonia and

19:08.980 --> 19:13.860
Albania have restarted negotiations to join the 27-member institution.

19:13.860 --> 19:18.260
The two Balkan countries were put on hold for two years after some EU members questioned

19:18.260 --> 19:22.820
their track records regarding democracy and corruption, but those concerns have been assuaged

19:22.820 --> 19:27.260
and there's renewed momentum for the two to join neighbors Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro,

19:27.260 --> 19:29.500
and Bosnia in entering the EU.

19:29.500 --> 19:34.860
Even with Great Britain's exit, the EU motto these days seems to be, the more, the merrier.

19:34.860 --> 19:39.780
Qatar is Australia's third biggest destination for lamb exports behind the US and China,

19:39.780 --> 19:44.320
but that's likely to change with the Arab country cancelling its subsidy of meat from

19:44.320 --> 19:45.380
down under.

19:45.380 --> 19:50.980
The subsidies, which support this $300 million a year trade, were set to expire in 2023,

19:50.980 --> 19:54.400
but Qatar abruptly announced their end this year.

19:54.400 --> 19:59.160
Some are linking the decision to Australia's criticism of Qatar's treatment of 13 Australian

19:59.160 --> 20:04.280
women earlier this year, who were questionably strip-searched at Doha International Airport.

20:04.280 --> 20:10.680
Qatar says that's not it, and rather it's to bolster their sustainability and independence.

20:10.680 --> 20:14.640
If you're one of those people who are sketched out by large bodies of water and their unknown

20:14.640 --> 20:17.420
contents, this won't provide comfort.

20:17.420 --> 20:21.520
In Lithuania, a team of divers completing a survey for bridge repairs came across the

20:21.520 --> 20:25.800
remains of a 16th-century soldier, including leather boots with spurs, a leather belt with

20:25.800 --> 20:28.160
a buckle, and an iron sword.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.480
Though the current bridge was built in 1934, records indicate there was also one in its

20:32.480 --> 20:34.080
place 500 years ago.

20:34.080 --> 20:39.240
It's the first underwater remains to be found in Lithuania, and researchers were impressed

20:39.240 --> 20:42.820
by how well-preserved the skeleton was.

20:42.820 --> 20:44.600
Know anyone looking for a pet elephant?

20:44.600 --> 20:48.440
Well, Namibia has 170 of them for sale.

20:48.440 --> 20:52.240
That's because, despite the mammal being on the endangered species list, they're

20:52.240 --> 20:56.680
seeing a population rebound in the South African country thanks to successful conservation

20:56.680 --> 21:02.160
measures, jumping from 7,500 in 1995 to 24,000 in 2019.

21:02.160 --> 21:07.520
But, with their growth comes an increase in human-elephant conflict, as well as a fight

21:07.520 --> 21:10.240
for natural resources during a drought year.

21:10.240 --> 21:15.000
Auctioning off some of the pachyderms may alleviate some of the stress and raise funds

21:15.000 --> 21:16.800
for the country.

21:16.800 --> 21:22.640
President Adamo Barro assumed leadership in the Gambia in 2017 after 22 years of brutal

21:22.640 --> 21:27.560
dictatorship, and at the time he promised to call for new elections after three years,

21:27.560 --> 21:30.080
instead of serving the full five-year term.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.660
Well, guess what?

21:31.660 --> 21:33.480
Now he wants the full five.

21:33.480 --> 21:37.240
Earlier this year, protesters took to the streets to show their disappointment and,

21:37.240 --> 21:42.320
in turn, 137 of them were arrested and dozens more were detained.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.840
For some residents, the show of four seemed like a harkening back to the country's darker

21:45.840 --> 21:49.900
days, and it looks like Barro will be staying in power.

21:49.900 --> 21:55.100
The second-largest diamond ever mined was unearthed in 2019, but it caused headlines

21:55.100 --> 21:57.460
this year for its subsequent sale.

21:57.460 --> 22:03.020
It wasn't a Diamond House or British Royal that bought the 1,758-carat gem, but French

22:03.020 --> 22:07.040
company Louis Vuitton that purchased it from the Caro Mine in Botswana.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.680
The sale isn't only notable because of the price—no numbers have been released but

22:10.680 --> 22:16.000
some estimate around $50 million—but because the buyer is a relative newcomer to the super-high-end

22:16.000 --> 22:20.760
jewelry market, and this boss move signals they're here to stay.

22:20.760 --> 22:25.280
Scientists in Gabon discovered their own treasure this year, finding the largest pangolin ever

22:25.280 --> 22:28.640
on record, and tagging it for research purposes.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.640
The scaly mammal is thought to be one of the most frequently illegally trafficked animals

22:32.640 --> 22:36.920
in the world, with much of the demand coming from Asia, and researchers are hoping that

22:36.920 --> 22:40.300
by learning about the creature's habits and movements, they'll be better able to

22:40.300 --> 22:45.680
protect it as demand increases for both its meat and bones, which are often used in Chinese

22:45.680 --> 22:47.040
medicine.

22:47.040 --> 22:51.840
Former Lesotho Prime Minister Thomas Taman has denied any role in his ex-wife's murder

22:51.840 --> 22:57.320
despite police reports that say he previously paid a $20,000 down payment for her killing,

22:57.320 --> 23:01.020
which was part of a $180,000 total sum.

23:01.020 --> 23:05.360
His ex-wife was shot in a car two days before his inauguration.

23:05.360 --> 23:09.540
Before that, she rejected getting a divorce so that she could remain the First Lady.

23:09.540 --> 23:15.480
He remarried two months after her death, but was forced to resign from power amid the controversy.

23:15.480 --> 23:20.360
North Macedonia, which only became north in 2019 to differ itself from the Greek region

23:20.360 --> 23:25.880
of Macedonia, has the potential to delineate itself through marijuana production too—if

23:25.880 --> 23:27.720
the government will support it.

23:27.720 --> 23:32.000
Though medical marijuana has been legal in the country since 2016, there's a new push

23:32.000 --> 23:37.140
to legalize cannabis in all forms and to ramp up production to supply Western European countries

23:37.140 --> 23:41.780
with pot, where sale and consumption are permitted in modest amounts, but huge grow operations

23:41.780 --> 23:42.780
are not.

23:42.960 --> 23:47.400
Toward the end of 2020, government officials signaled their support to make North Macedonia

23:47.400 --> 23:50.880
a quote, cannabis superpower.

23:50.880 --> 23:55.720
Burning and removing statues has been a thing this year, and a wood depiction of Melania

23:55.720 --> 24:00.840
Trump erected in her hometown of Sejanica, Slovenia was no exception.

24:00.840 --> 24:05.360
Someone set fire to the statue in July, so the artist took the reasonable action of replacing

24:05.360 --> 24:07.740
it in more permanent bronze.

24:07.740 --> 24:12.760
That was probably a good idea, since the town of 5,000 residents has seen upwards of 20,000

24:12.760 --> 24:19.500
Melania tourists a year since 2016, when President Trump took office.

24:19.500 --> 24:23.780
Vultures may not be the cutest birds, but they're one the animal kingdom needs for

24:23.780 --> 24:25.420
their scavenger role.

24:25.420 --> 24:30.140
Unfortunately, the hooded vulture in Guinea Bissau inched closer to extinction this year,

24:30.140 --> 24:33.940
with the accidental poisoning of more than 1,000 of the birds.

24:33.940 --> 24:38.620
There, residents put strychnine in the landfills to ward off feral dogs, with the unintended

24:38.620 --> 24:41.940
consequence of it being consumed by the scavenging birds.

24:41.940 --> 24:46.320
This actually happens a lot in Africa, and the vulture population across the continent

24:46.320 --> 24:48.760
is highly threatened because of it.

24:48.760 --> 24:53.760
A woman in Latvia made headlines for taking ten days off after her child was born, because

24:53.760 --> 24:56.200
she took it as paternity leave.

24:56.200 --> 25:00.280
Previously, same-sex couples in the country had not been granted the right to both take

25:00.280 --> 25:04.560
parental leave, but she fought the ruling as unconstitutional, and was the first woman

25:04.560 --> 25:08.240
in the country to use her paternity leave.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.760
Arab countries trying to get the attention of Europeans are doing it in perhaps the most

25:11.760 --> 25:15.980
obvious way ever—through soccer, or football, for the rest of the world.

25:15.980 --> 25:20.640
That's why Bahrain purchased a minority stake in football club Paris FC this year,

25:20.640 --> 25:24.660
with a direct goal to attract more Europeans to the Gulf state, which is still feeling

25:24.660 --> 25:29.280
the negative effects of stifling pro-democracy uprisings during the Arab Spring, and is therefore

25:29.280 --> 25:33.060
trying to patch up its global reputation.

25:33.060 --> 25:37.140
We hear a lot about the migration crises of people traveling from Africa to Europe and

25:37.140 --> 25:40.900
Central America to the United States, but a movement that gets less coverage is the

25:40.900 --> 25:45.200
one of Venezuelans, many of which go to Trinidad and Tobago.

25:45.200 --> 25:50.780
By late 2020, there were almost 20,000 registered refugees in the island nation, but amid the

25:50.780 --> 25:54.120
ones who made it, there are tragic stories too.

25:54.120 --> 25:59.400
Most recently, 11 Venezuelans, including children, died in a boat trying to cross the Gulf of

25:59.400 --> 26:05.200
Paria, which separates Trinidad from the Venezuelan coast by just under 7 miles or 11 kilometers.

26:05.200 --> 26:09.240
When a constitutional referendum passed in Guinea earlier this year that allowed the

26:09.240 --> 26:13.280
president to run for a third term instead of ending at two, it was certainly created

26:13.280 --> 26:15.720
with President Alpha Conde in mind.

26:15.720 --> 26:20.120
There were protests then, and again when he was re-elected in October with nearly 60%

26:20.120 --> 26:21.120
of a vote.

26:21.120 --> 26:25.000
Since the results, dozens have died in the demonstrations, but that didn't stop him

26:25.000 --> 26:29.440
from being sworn into office earlier this month.

26:29.440 --> 26:33.700
Cyber warfare seems like something that happens in the ether, but American operatives actually

26:33.700 --> 26:38.220
traveled to Estonia prior to the American election in November to learn about the northeastern

26:38.220 --> 26:41.340
European countries' sophisticated defense tactics.

26:41.340 --> 26:45.560
Specifically, the US had Russian hackers in mind, and Estonia has one of the stronger

26:45.560 --> 26:51.540
defense networks because Russia used to test its malware and disinformation campaigns there.

26:51.540 --> 26:57.440
A whistleblower from a 2004 case between Australia and East Timor continues to draw attention,

26:57.440 --> 27:01.220
and this year the lawyer for the anonymous whistleblower, referred to as Witness K, won

27:01.220 --> 27:04.500
a free speech prize for his work on the case.

27:04.500 --> 27:08.840
Witness K and lawyer Bernard Coolery revealed that Australia was spying on conversations

27:08.840 --> 27:13.800
between East Timorese officials about oil and gas negotiations in the Timor Sea.

27:13.800 --> 27:17.400
East Timor is one of the poorer countries in the world, and whistleblowing did help

27:17.400 --> 27:21.240
the country get a fairer financial deal.

27:21.240 --> 27:26.720
Mauritius is an Indian Ocean island country that sees 1.3 million visitors each year,

27:26.720 --> 27:29.680
many coming for its lagoons, tropical jungles, and mountains.

27:30.260 --> 27:35.940
But a Japanese oil tanker ran ashore in July spilling 1,000 tons of fuel into the sea,

27:35.940 --> 27:39.820
and since then more than 40 dolphins have washed up on shore.

27:39.820 --> 27:43.880
Some are worried the disaster could extend beyond dying dolphins and severely impact

27:43.880 --> 27:49.380
the country's environment and therefore its primary tourist draw—the pristine nature.

27:49.380 --> 27:54.580
Those who are in are in, but now that Cyprus has shut the door on its golden passport program,

27:54.580 --> 27:58.440
it will be harder for people to buy their way into the European Union.

27:58.440 --> 28:03.420
More than 3,000 foreigners who agreed to invest $2 million each into the country benefited

28:03.420 --> 28:07.820
from this program in its seven-year existence, but new allegations of, and no one could've

28:07.820 --> 28:11.340
guessed this, corruption have led officials to suspend the program.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.740
But that's not to say it wasn't worth it.

28:13.740 --> 28:17.300
Cyprus strays $7 billion from it, all told.

28:17.300 --> 28:23.040
Eswatini joined an exclusive club this past fall—countries that have consulates to Morocco

28:23.040 --> 28:24.860
in the Western Sahara.

28:24.860 --> 28:29.440
As covered earlier, this is a disputed zone claimed both by Morocco and the Polisario

28:29.440 --> 28:34.040
Front, and many countries choose not to state a strong position on the issue.

28:34.040 --> 28:38.440
With the opening of a consulate to Morocco in the Western Saharan city of Laoun, however,

28:38.440 --> 28:43.040
the Kingdom of Eswatini is firmly positioning itself on Morocco's side, and it becomes

28:43.040 --> 28:46.840
the 15th country to open a consulate to Morocco in the area.

28:46.840 --> 28:50.560
Do you remember the chameleon that hadn't been seen for 100 years in Madagascar?

28:50.560 --> 28:54.600
There's another good story like it out of Djibouti, where a mouse-sized elephant shrew

28:54.600 --> 28:57.740
has been seen again for the first time in 50 years.

28:57.740 --> 29:01.700
The good news in this case, unlike with the chameleon, is that the shrew's habitat isn't

29:01.700 --> 29:06.660
under threat, so scientists finding 12 animals from the 1000 traps set hopefully means it

29:06.660 --> 29:09.420
won't be another 50 years until they're seen again.

29:09.420 --> 29:14.540
When it comes to sharing good news, Fiji beat out all other countries to become the first

29:14.540 --> 29:18.180
nation to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden on his victory.

29:18.180 --> 29:22.860
Fijian Prime Minister Frank Beni Marama sent out the celebratory tweet before any other

29:22.860 --> 29:26.320
heads of state, but it wasn't purely altruistic.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.200
In the tweet, he called for action on the planet's climate emergency, and asked Biden

29:30.200 --> 29:33.960
to bring the United States back into the Paris Agreement.

29:33.960 --> 29:38.060
Think back to the origins of the pandemic, when the world still thought it would be confined

29:38.060 --> 29:39.060
to China.

29:39.060 --> 29:43.520
That's when the tiny island nation of the Comoros got some media attention for giving

29:43.520 --> 29:48.080
China 100 euros as a show of solidarity in fighting the virus.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.160
Of course, few places would be untouched, and it did hit the Comoros in late April,

29:52.160 --> 29:56.540
but ultimately, the Chinese-Comoros relationship is ongoing, as the world's most populated

29:56.540 --> 30:01.480
country continues to invest in the East African island as part of its military and economic

30:01.480 --> 30:02.660
strategy.

30:02.660 --> 30:07.420
Guyana is poised to be one of the world's next big oil producers, but there are some

30:07.420 --> 30:10.100
who aren't happy about that potential.

30:10.100 --> 30:14.740
ExxonMobil found sites that could potentially deliver 8 billion barrels of oil, which could

30:14.740 --> 30:20.180
amount to more than $20 billion in revenue for one of South America's poorer countries.

30:20.180 --> 30:24.920
The World Bank has pledged $55 million to help the country in its development, but critics

30:24.920 --> 30:28.560
say this opposes global goals in curbing fossil fuel dependency.

30:28.560 --> 30:34.680
China, India, and Bhutan are in ongoing negotiations over their definitive borders—the 25th round

30:34.680 --> 30:38.580
of talks was delayed this year because of, well, you know, everything—but that didn't

30:38.580 --> 30:43.600
stop impatient Chinese from constructing and inhabiting a village 1 mile or 1.6 kilometers

30:43.600 --> 30:46.600
within Bhutan's recognized border this year.

30:46.620 --> 30:50.660
This territorial grab is something China continues to do, especially to its immediate neighbors

30:50.660 --> 30:55.700
such as Bhutan, which has just under 800,000 residents and poses little threat to the world

30:55.700 --> 30:57.860
and military superpower.

30:57.860 --> 31:02.180
What do China, Iran, North Korea, and the Solomon Islands all have in common?

31:02.180 --> 31:05.360
Well, as of now, it's a Facebook ban.

31:05.360 --> 31:09.740
The South Pacific nation plans to join the three countries in banning the social media

31:09.740 --> 31:14.620
site because, according to officials, citizens are using it to abuse political leaders and

31:14.620 --> 31:16.920
access dangerous information.

31:16.920 --> 31:20.840
Facebook was used as an organizing tool for protests that crippled the nation's capital

31:20.840 --> 31:26.320
last year, and critics of the ban say this is a move to stop criticism of the government.

31:26.320 --> 31:31.760
The United States military is the strongest in the world, and other countries want a piece

31:31.760 --> 31:32.760
of it.

31:32.760 --> 31:40.240
For $36 million, Montenegro was able to buy a taste—67 joint light tactical vehicles.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.720
The agreement is part of a NATO-ally deal that allows such transactions between countries,

31:44.720 --> 31:48.740
and Montenegro is on the United States' friendly list as Western allies try to massage

31:48.740 --> 31:52.280
the region out of its Russian-dominated past.

31:52.280 --> 31:57.420
Looking to ease traffic congestion, Luxembourg became the first country in the world to offer

31:57.420 --> 32:00.860
public transportation entirely for free.

32:00.860 --> 32:06.180
Officials say it could save households roughly $125 per year, and also encourage public transportation

32:06.180 --> 32:11.960
use versus private vehicles, which account for 71% of leisure travel and 47% of business.

32:11.960 --> 32:16.220
A new tramway in the country's capital is one attractive alternative for riders.

32:16.220 --> 32:20.660
There is an exception, though—first-class passengers will still have to pay.

32:20.660 --> 32:25.500
South America's Suriname is switching gears, with the election of a new president who replaces

32:25.500 --> 32:30.280
a dictator-turned-populist running on a poor economic record and a pension for corruption.

32:30.280 --> 32:35.640
The new president, Censtantoki, assumes leadership of a country on the brink of financial collapse

32:35.640 --> 32:37.260
and diplomatic disarray.

32:37.260 --> 32:41.700
In recent years, the country turned to China and Venezuela for global ties, but Censtantoki

32:41.700 --> 32:47.020
will be tasked in realigning the country with its former imperial power, the Netherlands.

32:47.020 --> 32:51.320
When a Japanese couple on a world tour slash honeymoon were stranded due to pandemic travel

32:51.320 --> 32:56.020
bans on the ten tiny islands off the coast of West Africa known as Cape Verde, they settled

32:56.020 --> 32:58.680
in for five months and got to know the locals.

32:58.680 --> 33:03.880
Now, they'll be ambassadors for the country at the upcoming Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

33:03.940 --> 33:07.820
Cape Verde is sending three to four athletes, and though they've never won a medal in

33:07.820 --> 33:12.540
the Summer Games, they will at least be well-represented this time.

33:12.540 --> 33:17.340
Global superpowers continue to fight for strategic power on islands throughout the world, and

33:17.340 --> 33:21.560
this time, the United States has its eyes on the Maldives, where it announced it is

33:21.560 --> 33:23.460
opening an embassy.

33:23.460 --> 33:28.180
The string of 1,100 islands is also in the crosshairs of India and China, which have

33:28.180 --> 33:30.060
financially supported the nation.

33:30.080 --> 33:34.940
China has lent the country millions in infrastructure loans, which the Maldives are finding increasingly

33:34.940 --> 33:39.640
hard to pay back, and that potentially puts them in a debt-trap diplomacy situation.

33:39.640 --> 33:43.060
The US has promised a different approach.

33:43.060 --> 33:47.760
Our favorite nature narrator Sir David Attenborough gifted seven-year-old Prince George a prehistoric

33:47.760 --> 33:52.920
shark tooth that he collected while on family vacation in Malta more than 50 years ago.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.640
Malta did not appreciate the gesture.

33:55.640 --> 34:00.080
People said the 23-million-year-old fossil, which likely belonged to a megalodon, should

34:00.080 --> 34:03.840
rightfully find its place among their own country's cultural heritage.

34:03.840 --> 34:08.160
The Maltese eventually formally decided to let it slide this time, opting to avoid making

34:08.160 --> 34:10.400
the young prince cry.

34:10.400 --> 34:14.900
A couple of cases of beer may sound like a party in some countries, but in Brunei, for

34:14.900 --> 34:17.980
a foreigner, it meant getting questioned by police.

34:17.980 --> 34:23.280
An Indonesian national was found with 57 beers in his car at a road stop, which was a problem

34:23.280 --> 34:27.460
for him because alcohol is actually illegal in the country.

34:27.460 --> 34:32.200
There is an exception for non-Muslim foreigners, who are allowed to possess up to 12 cans or

34:32.200 --> 34:37.600
2 liters of beer, but he had four times the limit, and that's a party foul.

34:37.600 --> 34:42.920
It appears that fish off the coast of Belize have tamed a shrimp species in the same-ish

34:42.920 --> 34:47.880
way that humans domesticated dogs, at least according to new scientific research.

34:47.880 --> 34:53.080
Apparently, the damselfish aggressively defends a patch of algae against all predators because

34:53.080 --> 34:57.480
that's where it harvests food, but it allows misid shrimp to hang around.

34:57.480 --> 35:02.000
In turn, the shrimp fertilize the algae so it's better food for the damselfish.

35:02.000 --> 35:07.200
After time, the shrimp rely on the fish for protection, and that's domestication.

35:07.200 --> 35:12.180
Exploratory drilling near the Bahamas, and 150 miles or 240 kilometers from the Florida

35:12.180 --> 35:16.720
coast, is set to take place soon, despite opposition from environmental groups and a

35:16.720 --> 35:19.360
ban from the United States on offshore drilling.

35:19.360 --> 35:24.160
That's because the Bahamas Petroleum Company has leases on potential oil fields in the

35:24.160 --> 35:26.720
area, and they're exercising them.

35:26.720 --> 35:30.840
Some are worried about the environmental effects should something go wrong, as has been the

35:30.840 --> 35:35.320
case time and time again, but the Bahamas sees dollar signs that it needs in order to

35:35.320 --> 35:40.640
compensate for the financial hit it took when tourism ground to a halt this year.

35:40.640 --> 35:45.000
Researchers studying islanders in a less tropical part of the world found one interesting, and

35:45.000 --> 35:47.360
potentially evolutionary, trait.

35:47.360 --> 35:53.600
It seems that 2% of Iceland's residents can't smell foul fish—in fact, when presented

35:53.600 --> 35:59.280
with the malodorous sample, they pleasantly detected caramel, rose, or potatoes.

35:59.280 --> 36:04.600
These scientific human specimens possess a mutation that turns off their TAAR5 gene—you

36:04.600 --> 36:09.040
know, the one responsible for making a protein that recognizes trimethylamine, aka chemical

36:09.040 --> 36:12.840
found in rotten fish and sometimes human sweat and urine.

36:12.840 --> 36:17.080
Vanuatu is a country that's been hit hard by Mother Nature, having experienced two

36:17.080 --> 36:21.760
volcanic eruptions and two category 5 cyclones in the past five years.

36:21.760 --> 36:26.080
Disaster relief is something officials there are having to learn quickly and execute often.

36:26.080 --> 36:30.780
To do so, one system they've recently implemented is distributing emergency relief funds to

36:30.780 --> 36:34.580
residents via blockchain technology and tap-and-pay cards.

36:34.580 --> 36:38.080
The cards are loaded with money that residents can use immediately, and it avoids some of

36:38.080 --> 36:42.160
the red tape that typically consumes relief efforts.

36:42.160 --> 36:46.480
Racial reckoning sparked movements worldwide, and that groundswell did not leave the island

36:46.520 --> 36:48.560
of Barbados untouched.

36:48.560 --> 36:52.560
This most eastern island in the Caribbean formally announced it would remove Queen Elizabeth

36:52.560 --> 36:57.620
as its head of state and become a republic in 2021, citing long-simmering tensions about

36:57.620 --> 37:00.960
the legacy of colonization and racial injustice.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.680
Some see the island's decision to part with the monarchy as a tipping point for neighboring

37:04.680 --> 37:08.700
countries who may also seek their own independence.

37:08.700 --> 37:13.360
To help young women in Sao Tome and Principe, the World Bank announced its commitment of

37:13.360 --> 37:16.160
$15 million to empower young girls.

37:16.160 --> 37:20.360
Providing safe learning spaces in schools is one of the immediate goals of the funding,

37:20.360 --> 37:24.200
where dropping out and pregnancy are common for girls at a young age.

37:24.200 --> 37:28.220
Concurrently, but unrelated to the funding, the country's National Olympic Committee

37:28.220 --> 37:32.880
announced a push to encourage girls aged 6 to 18 into surfing lessons—another way to

37:32.880 --> 37:37.120
steer young women into positive alternatives, and potentially build their summer Olympics

37:37.120 --> 37:38.120
team.

37:38.120 --> 37:43.080
Samoa's state-owned flag carrier Samoa Airways was reporting financial trouble at a loss

37:43.080 --> 37:47.360
of $25 million in 2019, according to reports.

37:47.360 --> 37:51.200
That was before this year, and the decimation of passenger demand, and so it's not looking

37:51.200 --> 37:52.780
any better for them.

37:52.780 --> 37:57.740
The airline also reportedly owes $11 million to creditors, but of course, executives are

37:57.740 --> 37:59.780
painting a rosier picture.

37:59.780 --> 38:05.480
This all comes as Samoa Airways tries to complete its lease negotiations for a Boeing 737-800

38:05.480 --> 38:08.680
from the Netherlands, and further debt could hinder those.

38:09.280 --> 38:13.600
When it comes to the world's top honeymoon destination, there's one place that keeps

38:13.600 --> 38:19.760
blowing every other location out of international waters, so to speak—Saint Lucia.

38:19.760 --> 38:24.000
The Caribbean island was named the number one honeymoon locale for the 12th time and

38:24.000 --> 38:25.680
third consecutive year.

38:25.680 --> 38:30.720
The World Travel Awards were announced virtually in Moscow this year, and hopefully, by this

38:30.720 --> 38:35.760
time next year, people won't have to take a virtual honeymoon to Saint Lucia.

38:35.840 --> 38:40.880
This change is impacting all islands, including the 32 atolls that comprise the nation of

38:40.880 --> 38:41.880
Kiribati.

38:41.880 --> 38:46.160
That's why President Tenati Maumau will accept funding from China to dredge sand along

38:46.160 --> 38:50.160
the most populous islands to actually raise them out of the sea.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.560
Some see this as a strategic play by China, to inch further into the Pacific Ocean, where

38:54.560 --> 38:58.720
military presence closer to the United States would certainly be a power move.

38:58.720 --> 39:03.320
Maumau, however, says Kiribati would not grant China the gift of building a base on its nearby

39:03.320 --> 39:08.480
Christmas Island, which just happens to be relatively close to Hawaii.

39:08.480 --> 39:14.000
The Federated States of Micronesia are composed of more than 600 islands stretching 1,600

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
miles or 2,700 kilometers across the Pacific Ocean.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.800
The country's population is quite small in comparison to the vastness that gives it

39:21.800 --> 39:25.480
the 14th largest exclusive economic zone in the world.

39:25.480 --> 39:30.160
This is what makes the rescue of three stranded men who wrote SOS in the sand on a deserted

39:30.160 --> 39:31.600
atoll most impressive.

39:31.600 --> 39:36.800
They'd run out of fuel and drifted 118 miles or 190 kilometers west of their departure

39:36.800 --> 39:41.980
point, and were spotted by a search plane three days after their departure.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.940
Another stranded island story transports us to Grenada, where a British woman visiting

39:45.940 --> 39:50.240
the Caribbean island found herself stuck thanks to the spring's travel bans.

39:50.240 --> 39:54.500
The problem is that she was six months pregnant, and ended up delivering her child on the island

39:54.500 --> 39:55.760
prematurely.

39:55.760 --> 40:00.040
She ended up securing a repatriation flight in June, becoming one of tens of thousands

40:00.040 --> 40:03.680
of British who were chartered back from at least 57 countries.

40:03.680 --> 40:07.960
We're getting to the smaller countries, and most of them are islands.

40:07.960 --> 40:13.600
During 2015, a 30-mile, 50-kilometer algal bloom made a slow water surface crawl into

40:13.600 --> 40:18.520
the Pacific, and scientists were baffled by what caused it, until a report was released

40:18.520 --> 40:19.640
this year.

40:19.640 --> 40:24.700
The patch was created by Tonga Island runoff, rich in iron and phosphorus.

40:24.700 --> 40:30.200
This is common, but its delayed appearance is not, and that's what confused scientists.

40:30.200 --> 40:34.440
It took some time for a nitrogen fixer to utilize the nutrients, making it seem like

40:34.440 --> 40:39.840
the bloom came out of nowhere when it had actually slow-cooked its way across the ocean.

40:39.840 --> 40:43.780
Travel between Ukraine and St. Vincent and the Grenadines became easier following the

40:43.780 --> 40:47.480
signing of a visa-free travel agreement between the two countries.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.660
The Caribbean country is part of the Commonwealth of Nations, a political association of 54

40:51.660 --> 40:55.000
members, nearly all former territories of the British Empire.

40:55.000 --> 40:59.520
Ukraine has its eyes on some of the more powerful Commonwealth members granting visa-free travel,

40:59.520 --> 41:03.800
or at least the ambassador tweeted an allusion to that, with Australia, the UK, and Canada

41:03.800 --> 41:05.040
on his wishlist.

41:05.040 --> 41:10.360
It's been 44 years since the Seychelles secured its independence from Britain, and

41:10.360 --> 41:14.860
this year marked the first time that a president from the opposition party won an election

41:14.860 --> 41:16.800
since the country's British breakaway.

41:16.820 --> 41:21.300
That's being heralded as a step towards greater democracy, with Wavell Ram Calawan

41:21.300 --> 41:27.140
defeating an incumbent from the United Seychelles Party, which had been in power since 1977.

41:27.140 --> 41:32.020
British sailor and 72-year-old man Graham Walters was super social distancing when he

41:32.020 --> 41:36.420
sailed from Great Britain to Antigua, setting the record for the oldest person to cross

41:36.420 --> 41:37.900
the Atlantic Ocean solo.

41:37.900 --> 41:42.580
It was actually his fifth trip across the ocean, and he nearly went awry at the end

41:42.580 --> 41:46.980
when strong winds blew him 6 miles or 10 kilometers off course of Antigua.

41:46.980 --> 41:50.860
He was able to call the Coast Guard and get a tow to his final destination, and officials

41:50.860 --> 41:54.800
still counted it as a world record even with the assist.

41:54.800 --> 42:00.800
One of the tiniest European countries, Andorra, joined the big guns and became the 190th nation

42:00.800 --> 42:03.560
to become a part of the International Monetary Fund.

42:03.560 --> 42:04.840
But why now?

42:04.840 --> 42:09.280
Well, crisis financing mostly, which the IMF comes through on for countries in need, among

42:09.280 --> 42:10.640
other missions.

42:10.660 --> 42:15.260
Trade and tourism—mostly ski resorts and hiking trails—contribute to 40% of the mountainous

42:15.260 --> 42:18.900
country's economy, and they're hurting right now with a lack thereof.

42:18.900 --> 42:23.580
A Caribbean island that's counting on tourism and the economy bouncing back is Dominica.

42:23.580 --> 42:28.320
It announced its intentions to build a new long-haul airport, capitalizing on a growing

42:28.320 --> 42:31.020
eco-tourism and offshore financial sector.

42:31.020 --> 42:34.660
Currently, visitors must transfer to Dominica through a neighboring island, but this new

42:34.660 --> 42:39.060
airport would make direct trips from the United States, United Kingdom, and Western Europe

42:39.060 --> 42:40.420
more possible.

42:40.420 --> 42:44.560
Officials say it will be largely financed by foreigners who pay in exchange for a passport,

42:44.560 --> 42:47.960
but it seems that we've heard this story before.

42:47.960 --> 42:51.820
What drifts away from the coast of Mexico likely ends up at the Marshall Islands, according

42:51.820 --> 42:53.520
to computer simulations.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.840
In this case, it was a boat full of cocaine.

42:56.840 --> 43:01.320
Without any evidence or leads, law enforcement officials have theorized that a boat filled

43:01.320 --> 43:06.660
with 1,430 pounds or 650 kilograms of the illegal drug came from the Mexican or Central

43:06.660 --> 43:11.260
American coast, and it had probably been floating captainless for at least a year.

43:11.260 --> 43:15.540
Though drugs have washed up onshore before, this was the largest ever haul, and it was

43:15.540 --> 43:17.620
quickly incinerated.

43:17.620 --> 43:21.260
It seems that Caribbean islands are all vying for new citizens, and the influx of money

43:21.260 --> 43:22.260
they bring.

43:22.260 --> 43:27.180
Saint Kitts and Nevis has made the process so easy that wealthy investors can get citizenship

43:27.180 --> 43:31.760
in under 60 days—one of the fastest tracks in the world—without even having to step

43:31.760 --> 43:35.800
foot in the country, and for that they've been recognized by the Financial Times for

43:35.800 --> 43:39.280
having one of the best citizen-by-investment programs.

43:39.280 --> 43:46.060
For $150,000, a family of four can call Saint Kitts their second, or third, or fourth home.

43:46.060 --> 43:50.560
Sir Jim Ratcliffe is another wealthy individual moving to sunnier skies—he's leaving the

43:50.560 --> 43:56.440
United Kingdom for Monaco, where he'll save up to $5.4 billion in taxes.

43:56.440 --> 44:02.760
Ratcliffe is a petrochemicals magnate with an estimated worth of $23.6 billion.

44:02.760 --> 44:07.680
People who live in Monaco for at least 183 days a year don't pay income or property

44:07.680 --> 44:12.720
taxes, and that's a lot different from the up to 45% he could be paying under the UK's

44:12.720 --> 44:14.360
tax system.

44:14.360 --> 44:19.600
Sandwiched between Austria and Switzerland, Liechtenstein said no to developing an international

44:19.600 --> 44:20.680
rail system.

44:20.680 --> 44:26.320
The country is only 15 miles or 25 kilometers long, and has just one domestic track.

44:26.320 --> 44:29.940
This initiative would have widened it and upgraded one of the terminals so that international

44:29.940 --> 44:34.100
trains could stop there, but voters turned down the project at the polls—balking at

44:34.100 --> 44:37.820
the $73.5 million price tag.

44:37.820 --> 44:42.500
With a 6pm curfew in Italy due to lockdowns, residents looking for a little nightlife are

44:42.500 --> 44:47.400
hopping the border into San Marino, where bars and restaurants are open until 10pm.

44:47.400 --> 44:51.460
The small, independent country is just ten minutes from cities such as Raimini, and Italian

44:51.460 --> 44:55.460
officials are frustrated that by San Marino not falling in line with their own guidelines,

44:55.460 --> 44:59.820
they're putting more citizens at risk of spreading the virus.

44:59.820 --> 45:04.980
Palau, about 1,000 miles or 1,600 kilometers from the Philippines, has a free association

45:04.980 --> 45:09.580
agreement with the United States that delivers significant financial aid, and gives Palauans

45:09.580 --> 45:12.820
the right to travel to, live, and work in the US.

45:12.820 --> 45:18.500
But that current compact expires in 2024, and Palau wants even more US presence.

45:18.500 --> 45:22.540
They've invited America to build a military base on their island.

45:22.540 --> 45:27.340
Currently, Palau has no military, and they see an American base there as a way to bolster

45:27.340 --> 45:31.340
security, and for the United States, it's a way to push back against growing Chinese

45:31.340 --> 45:33.240
influence in the region.

45:33.240 --> 45:38.220
The Perth Mint in Australia produces Tuvalu's currency, including the Tuvalu dollar, which

45:38.220 --> 45:42.580
is used alongside the Australian dollar and a series of collectible coins.

45:42.580 --> 45:46.660
This year, Tuvalu issued a coin of American film star John Wayne that has been selling

45:46.660 --> 45:48.780
for more than $100.

45:48.780 --> 45:53.060
It turns out, the collectible coin business is quite lucrative for the tiny island, which

45:53.060 --> 45:57.020
receives about $200,000 a year in royalties.

45:57.020 --> 46:00.880
The coins are technically legal tender, but more so they're purchased by international

46:00.880 --> 46:03.100
collectors.

46:03.100 --> 46:07.740
Australia uses the tiny Micronesian island of Nauru as an outpost for refugees to spend

46:07.740 --> 46:10.020
time while their claims are processed.

46:10.020 --> 46:14.380
In combination with Papua New Guinea, where detainees are also kept, there are about 300

46:14.380 --> 46:19.700
people held, but Australia spent $1.2 billion this financial year to keep them there, equally

46:19.700 --> 46:22.100
about $4 million per person.

46:22.100 --> 46:25.760
This is causing many to turn their heads at the exorbitant cost that would be better spent

46:25.760 --> 46:28.200
just keeping those refugees in Australia.

46:28.200 --> 46:32.760
On top of that, conditions in the refugee camps are poor and sometimes dangerous, so

46:32.760 --> 46:35.980
the money has not been well spent.

46:35.980 --> 46:39.700
And here we are, the world's smallest country, the Vatican City.

46:39.700 --> 46:45.560
This year has a very 2020 story—Catholicism's headquarters may have missed the mark on the

46:45.560 --> 46:46.820
nativity scene.

46:46.820 --> 46:51.400
Each year, the Holy City produces a new scene donated by an Italian city.

46:51.400 --> 46:55.660
This year Castelli, a town known for ceramics, got the spotlight, but the curious stylings

46:55.660 --> 46:59.660
of coiled clay-meat astronauts have received curious reviews.

46:59.660 --> 47:03.740
Castellians made the figures over decades, and they've survived natural disasters and

47:03.740 --> 47:04.740
more.

47:04.740 --> 47:09.120
One observer saw hope in the scene—quote, it's a nativity scene that has had problems

47:09.120 --> 47:11.700
like we've all had in a lousy year, she said.

47:11.700 --> 47:14.340
If it made it, we can.

47:14.340 --> 47:15.340
And that's it.

47:15.340 --> 47:19.220
That's the news you missed in 2020, or at least some of it, from every country in the

47:19.220 --> 47:20.220
world.

47:20.220 --> 47:24.140
If you've made it to this point, you're clearly a lover of learning about the world.

47:24.140 --> 47:28.020
Therefore, I'm going to recommend you an audiobook from our sponsor, Audible, that

47:28.020 --> 47:32.360
would honestly be stunned if someone who made it through all 195 countries has not already

47:32.360 --> 47:33.360
listened to.

47:33.360 --> 47:38.220
It's Prisoners of Geography, by Tim Marshall, which is this fascinating read about how geography

47:38.220 --> 47:39.420
constrains countries.

47:39.420 --> 47:44.240
It explains things like why Putin is so focused on Crimea, why Europe will never be united,

47:44.240 --> 47:46.940
and why the US was destined to become a superpower.

47:46.940 --> 47:50.620
You can actually listen to this completely for free by signing up for a free trial to

47:50.620 --> 47:54.480
