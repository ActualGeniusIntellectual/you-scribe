9080	14080	If you look at the list of the world's twelve largest economies, there's a clear split.
14080	18120	Six are relatively small countries where one could never be more than a few hundred miles
18120	19940	or kilometers from the ocean.
19940	25080	The other six—the United States, China, India, Brazil, Canada, and Russia—are enormous
25080	29720	countries with spots more than a thousand miles or 1,600 kilometers from the ocean.
29720	34680	It's well known that ships are the main method of transport for freight globally thanks
34680	36100	to their low cost.
36100	39480	In fact, 90% of world trade goes by sea.
39480	43760	While most of the population lives relatively near the ocean, there are still plenty of
43760	49200	populated areas far inland that too need a method of low-cost freight transport.
49200	51160	For that, there's freight trains.
51160	55780	Most surprisingly, those six physically largest of the twelve largest economies are, rearranged
55780	59520	in order, the world's six top users of freight rail transport.
59520	62880	To understand the role of freight rail, you have to look at the numbers.
62880	67440	In the US it costs, on average, about 4 cents to move one ton of freight, the weight of
67440	70120	a small car, one mile on a freight train.
70120	72880	That's about 2.5 cents per ton kilometer.
72880	77460	What that means is that, on average, you could move one ton of freight coast to coast, from
77460	81140	New York to Los Angeles, on a train for about $100.
81140	86640	It's worth noting that freight rail prices in the US are among the lowest in the world.
86640	89900	In most European countries, for example, they're nearly double.
89900	95780	In comparison to those 4 cents per mile, air freight transport in the US costs about 121
95780	100460	cents per ton mile or 75 cents per ton kilometer but air freight is not truly a competitor
100460	101860	to the railways.
101860	105400	Planes will tend to carry time-sensitive or valuable goods while trains will carry lower
105400	107740	value or less time-sensitive goods.
107740	112840	The true competitor to trains are trucks which carry a ton a mile at a cost of around 20
112840	115100	cents or 13 cents per ton kilometer.
115100	119120	This is noticeably higher but trucks, of course, can go anywhere.
119120	121120	Trains can only go where there are tracks.
121120	126040	Now, the reason why trains are so cheap is because they are quite a bit more efficient
126040	127040	than trucks.
127040	133840	In 2017, Union Pacific Railroad, as an example, moved freight a total of 471 billion ton miles.
134280	138400	That's the total number of miles multiplied by the total number of tons moved.
138400	142960	To do that, they used just over 1 billion gallons of diesel fuel meaning it took, on
142960	149040	average, only one gallon of fuel to move one ton of freight 469 miles.
149040	151520	That's far more efficient than a truck.
151520	155520	The reason behind this is simple—trains encounter less resistance.
155520	159500	Their smooth steel wheels run over smooth steel tracks so there's very little friction
159500	162280	compared to rubber truck tires running over the road.
162280	166580	In addition, since the train's just one long line, there's much less wind resistance
166580	168240	per ton than a truck.
168240	173480	A single locomotive uses huge amounts of fuel but can have upwards of 6,000 horsepower and
173480	176560	can therefore pull a huge number of cars.
176560	181640	On average, in the US, freight trains are about 6,500 feet or 2,000 meters long.
181640	183060	They can get longer, though.
183060	189580	In Canada, Canadian National regularly runs 14,000 feet or 4,300 meter long trains.
189580	194300	It would take nearly an hour to walk from one end of this train to the other.
194300	199140	Typically, it only takes two people to run even these multi-mile long freight trains.
199140	202860	Considering that most trucks take one person to transport one container and these trains
202860	206120	can carry hundreds, it's easy to see the advantage.
206120	210740	In some cases, freight trains are even run by only one individual—the driver.
210740	214480	Of course there are plenty of safety concerns with that but railroads are increasingly doing
214480	216740	so as it cuts down on cost.
216740	221200	Overall, what this means is that freight trains are quite comparatively efficient both economically
221200	224780	and environmentally to other means of land transport.
224780	228740	Within the cab of a locomotive, there's generally not much other than the train controls,
228740	230900	a few seats, and a small lavatory.
230900	234820	There are no beds or other accommodations because crews don't stay on board for all
234820	236000	that long.
236000	240300	Every driver and conductor in a company works a defined territory along the overall train
240300	245140	route so for longer runs, such as BNSF's route from Seattle to Chicago, for example,
245140	247740	it takes ten different crews to make the trip.
247740	250980	The first takes the train from Seattle to Wenatchee, Washington, then switches with
250980	255140	another crew that takes us to Spokane, Washington, and then this crew swap process repeats itself
255140	260460	in Whitefish, Haver, Glasgow, Minot, East Dilworth, Northtown, and North La Crosse before
260460	262360	the train arrives in Chicago.
262360	266460	In most cases, crews will typically live at one end of their territory, work the train
266460	270600	to the other end, stay in a hotel overnight, then swap with an inbound crew to take command
270600	272740	of a train headed back to where they live.
272740	277780	Now, under US law, each crew is only allowed to work for up to 12 hours at a time before
277780	281620	needing a rest period and so these territories where crew work are designed to be able to
281620	283880	be completed in those 12 hours.
283880	289580	For longer sections, though, like the 276 mile, 444 kilometer section from Glasgow to
289580	292980	Minot, there's increased risk of timing out in case of slowdown.
292980	297020	If a train crew reaches 12 hours, they quite literally have to stop in their tracks and
297020	299420	wait until another crew arrives.
299420	303440	Eventually the railroad will drive out a relief crew from the next stop, in this case Minot,
303440	304440	to take over.
304440	310060	Now, there are two major types of cargo transported by rail—bulk and intermodal.
310060	313980	Bulk cargo is things like grain, stone, sand, oil, and coal.
313980	319100	Coal, along with most bulk cargo, is not a value-dense product, as in, it costs a little
319100	320620	to get a lot.
320620	325420	In the US, a ton of coal costs only $34 on average so of course you need to put it on
325420	329740	the lowest cost transport method possible which in many cases is trains.
329740	333740	Trains both serve to bring coal from the mine to their domestic destinations, mostly power
333740	337660	plants, and to coastal ports to be loaded on ships for international export.
337660	341740	The other major type of freight, intermodal, involves the carrying of shipping containers
341740	343620	to and from their destinations.
343620	347820	Generally, trains will carry these containers as only a step in their overall journey.
347820	351780	For example, a container might be picked up from a factory in Shenzhen, China, brought
351780	355540	by truck to the port of Shenzhen, loaded on a ship to Long Beach, California, moved
355540	359720	onto a train to Omaha, Nebraska, before being loaded again on a truck for its final journey
359720	361220	to Norfolk, Nebraska.
361220	365140	Generally, railroads will have their intermodal terminals, where containers are unloaded and
365140	370100	loaded, spread out about 300 to 500 miles or 500 to 800 kilometers apart from each other
370100	374600	so the greatest area can be reached within a day's truck drive from one of their terminals.
374600	378620	Given the lackluster nature of the US's passenger railways, it may surprise some that
378620	382580	the country's freight railway system is considered among the world's best.
382580	386720	The country is just in that sweet spot of economically busy and spread out that supports
386720	388320	the use of freight trains.
388320	392660	It therefore serves as a good example to examine to explain how freight trains work worldwide.
392660	395620	The US's network is quite extensive.
395620	400700	As an example, Kansas, whose entire passenger rail network consists of this, has a freight
400700	402420	rail network of this.
402420	406380	What helps is that in most countries the government builds tracks primarily for passenger train
406380	409180	usage and freight operators pay to use them.
409180	411460	In the US, though, it's the other way around.
411460	415360	In most cases, the track is owned by freight operators and the government pays them to
415360	417720	use it for passenger operations.
417720	421460	Through many years of consolidation, seven major freight railroads have emerged in North
421460	427260	America each with their own territory—Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian
427260	430620	National, Canadian Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.
430620	435020	With the exception of Canadian National, none operates coast to coast so for longer journeys,
435020	438300	a single operator could not get freight from start to finish.
438300	440940	Now, take a look at this BNSF train.
440940	445100	You'll notice at the end it's hauling a CSX car and a Union Pacific car.
445100	449660	That's because, since no one railroad covers the entire continent, different ones work
449660	452300	together to get freight to its final destination.
452300	456660	A container traveling from Oakland, California to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for example,
456660	460220	would be first brought to Lathrop, California where Union Pacific has a rail yard.
460220	463700	It would then be taken off the truck and loaded onto an eastbound train.
463700	467180	After passing through the western United States and arriving in Chicago, the container
467180	471540	would then be removed, hauled short distance from the Union Pacific to the CSX terminal,
471540	476440	and placed on a CSX train since Chicago is as far east as Union Pacific goes.
476440	479700	That train would then take it to Kearny, New Jersey, near New York City where it would
479700	483980	then be loaded on another truck to take it to its final destination in Philadelphia.
483980	487060	This is already complicated, but it can get even more.
487060	490540	Sometimes different railroads don't partner or won't allow for seamless transfers between
490540	492500	certain origin and destination pairs.
492500	496940	Chicago, for example, has dozens of different rail yards used by different railroads so
496940	501380	in order to get a container through one might have to book a spot on one train to the city,
501380	505740	then book a transfer by truck from one terminal to that of another railroad, then book separately
505740	507900	the next train out of the city.
507900	511800	This increases complexity enormously and it's often difficult to find truck drivers willing
511800	515580	to make the short cross-town trip especially given the current shortage of truck drivers
515580	517020	in the US.
517020	520480	Many of these complexities are handled by logistics companies hired by clients to manage
520480	523920	the movement of their freight, but these interchanges can still slow down shipping
523920	525800	times significantly.
525800	529880	There is this constant battle between the trucking and rail industry.
529880	533700	Hired rail lobbyists in the US constantly work against the trucking industry by dissuading
533700	536680	Congress from increasing weight and size limits of trucks.
536680	540520	With a nearly global shortage of truck drivers, though, railroads are at an advantage right
540520	542680	now and many are thriving.
542680	546600	New railroads are constantly under construction worldwide, especially in developing nations,
546600	548600	and the industry is growing.
548600	550520	It's not completely safe, though.
550520	554240	The advent of driverless trucks will surely reduce costs and increase capacity in the
554240	557960	trucking industry which could tilt favor over to the rubber tires.
557960	562680	In addition, coal is one of the most commonly carried goods by freight trains and, as the
562680	567940	world transitions towards renewable energy, there could be less demand for its transportation.
567940	571880	Overall though, at least until there's a monumental shift in technology, freight trains
571880	577920	will continue to be the proven method for moving freight long distances over land.
