00:09.080 --> 00:14.080
If you look at the list of the world's twelve largest economies, there's a clear split.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.120
Six are relatively small countries where one could never be more than a few hundred miles

00:18.120 --> 00:19.940
or kilometers from the ocean.

00:19.940 --> 00:25.080
The other six—the United States, China, India, Brazil, Canada, and Russia—are enormous

00:25.080 --> 00:29.720
countries with spots more than a thousand miles or 1,600 kilometers from the ocean.

00:29.720 --> 00:34.680
It's well known that ships are the main method of transport for freight globally thanks

00:34.680 --> 00:36.100
to their low cost.

00:36.100 --> 00:39.480
In fact, 90% of world trade goes by sea.

00:39.480 --> 00:43.760
While most of the population lives relatively near the ocean, there are still plenty of

00:43.760 --> 00:49.200
populated areas far inland that too need a method of low-cost freight transport.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.160
For that, there's freight trains.

00:51.160 --> 00:55.780
Most surprisingly, those six physically largest of the twelve largest economies are, rearranged

00:55.780 --> 00:59.520
in order, the world's six top users of freight rail transport.

00:59.520 --> 01:02.880
To understand the role of freight rail, you have to look at the numbers.

01:02.880 --> 01:07.440
In the US it costs, on average, about 4 cents to move one ton of freight, the weight of

01:07.440 --> 01:10.120
a small car, one mile on a freight train.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.880
That's about 2.5 cents per ton kilometer.

01:12.880 --> 01:17.460
What that means is that, on average, you could move one ton of freight coast to coast, from

01:17.460 --> 01:21.140
New York to Los Angeles, on a train for about $100.

01:21.140 --> 01:26.640
It's worth noting that freight rail prices in the US are among the lowest in the world.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.900
In most European countries, for example, they're nearly double.

01:29.900 --> 01:35.780
In comparison to those 4 cents per mile, air freight transport in the US costs about 121

01:35.780 --> 01:40.460
cents per ton mile or 75 cents per ton kilometer but air freight is not truly a competitor

01:40.460 --> 01:41.860
to the railways.

01:41.860 --> 01:45.400
Planes will tend to carry time-sensitive or valuable goods while trains will carry lower

01:45.400 --> 01:47.740
value or less time-sensitive goods.

01:47.740 --> 01:52.840
The true competitor to trains are trucks which carry a ton a mile at a cost of around 20

01:52.840 --> 01:55.100
cents or 13 cents per ton kilometer.

01:55.100 --> 01:59.120
This is noticeably higher but trucks, of course, can go anywhere.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.120
Trains can only go where there are tracks.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.040
Now, the reason why trains are so cheap is because they are quite a bit more efficient

02:06.040 --> 02:07.040
than trucks.

02:07.040 --> 02:13.840
In 2017, Union Pacific Railroad, as an example, moved freight a total of 471 billion ton miles.

02:14.280 --> 02:18.400
That's the total number of miles multiplied by the total number of tons moved.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.960
To do that, they used just over 1 billion gallons of diesel fuel meaning it took, on

02:22.960 --> 02:29.040
average, only one gallon of fuel to move one ton of freight 469 miles.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.520
That's far more efficient than a truck.

02:31.520 --> 02:35.520
The reason behind this is simple—trains encounter less resistance.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.500
Their smooth steel wheels run over smooth steel tracks so there's very little friction

02:39.500 --> 02:42.280
compared to rubber truck tires running over the road.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.580
In addition, since the train's just one long line, there's much less wind resistance

02:46.580 --> 02:48.240
per ton than a truck.

02:48.240 --> 02:53.480
A single locomotive uses huge amounts of fuel but can have upwards of 6,000 horsepower and

02:53.480 --> 02:56.560
can therefore pull a huge number of cars.

02:56.560 --> 03:01.640
On average, in the US, freight trains are about 6,500 feet or 2,000 meters long.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.060
They can get longer, though.

03:03.060 --> 03:09.580
In Canada, Canadian National regularly runs 14,000 feet or 4,300 meter long trains.

03:09.580 --> 03:14.300
It would take nearly an hour to walk from one end of this train to the other.

03:14.300 --> 03:19.140
Typically, it only takes two people to run even these multi-mile long freight trains.

03:19.140 --> 03:22.860
Considering that most trucks take one person to transport one container and these trains

03:22.860 --> 03:26.120
can carry hundreds, it's easy to see the advantage.

03:26.120 --> 03:30.740
In some cases, freight trains are even run by only one individual—the driver.

03:30.740 --> 03:34.480
Of course there are plenty of safety concerns with that but railroads are increasingly doing

03:34.480 --> 03:36.740
so as it cuts down on cost.

03:36.740 --> 03:41.200
Overall, what this means is that freight trains are quite comparatively efficient both economically

03:41.200 --> 03:44.780
and environmentally to other means of land transport.

03:44.780 --> 03:48.740
Within the cab of a locomotive, there's generally not much other than the train controls,

03:48.740 --> 03:50.900
a few seats, and a small lavatory.

03:50.900 --> 03:54.820
There are no beds or other accommodations because crews don't stay on board for all

03:54.820 --> 03:56.000
that long.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.300
Every driver and conductor in a company works a defined territory along the overall train

04:00.300 --> 04:05.140
route so for longer runs, such as BNSF's route from Seattle to Chicago, for example,

04:05.140 --> 04:07.740
it takes ten different crews to make the trip.

04:07.740 --> 04:10.980
The first takes the train from Seattle to Wenatchee, Washington, then switches with

04:10.980 --> 04:15.140
another crew that takes us to Spokane, Washington, and then this crew swap process repeats itself

04:15.140 --> 04:20.460
in Whitefish, Haver, Glasgow, Minot, East Dilworth, Northtown, and North La Crosse before

04:20.460 --> 04:22.360
the train arrives in Chicago.

04:22.360 --> 04:26.460
In most cases, crews will typically live at one end of their territory, work the train

04:26.460 --> 04:30.600
to the other end, stay in a hotel overnight, then swap with an inbound crew to take command

04:30.600 --> 04:32.740
of a train headed back to where they live.

04:32.740 --> 04:37.780
Now, under US law, each crew is only allowed to work for up to 12 hours at a time before

04:37.780 --> 04:41.620
needing a rest period and so these territories where crew work are designed to be able to

04:41.620 --> 04:43.880
be completed in those 12 hours.

04:43.880 --> 04:49.580
For longer sections, though, like the 276 mile, 444 kilometer section from Glasgow to

04:49.580 --> 04:52.980
Minot, there's increased risk of timing out in case of slowdown.

04:52.980 --> 04:57.020
If a train crew reaches 12 hours, they quite literally have to stop in their tracks and

04:57.020 --> 04:59.420
wait until another crew arrives.

04:59.420 --> 05:03.440
Eventually the railroad will drive out a relief crew from the next stop, in this case Minot,

05:03.440 --> 05:04.440
to take over.

05:04.440 --> 05:10.060
Now, there are two major types of cargo transported by rail—bulk and intermodal.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.980
Bulk cargo is things like grain, stone, sand, oil, and coal.

05:13.980 --> 05:19.100
Coal, along with most bulk cargo, is not a value-dense product, as in, it costs a little

05:19.100 --> 05:20.620
to get a lot.

05:20.620 --> 05:25.420
In the US, a ton of coal costs only $34 on average so of course you need to put it on

05:25.420 --> 05:29.740
the lowest cost transport method possible which in many cases is trains.

05:29.740 --> 05:33.740
Trains both serve to bring coal from the mine to their domestic destinations, mostly power

05:33.740 --> 05:37.660
plants, and to coastal ports to be loaded on ships for international export.

05:37.660 --> 05:41.740
The other major type of freight, intermodal, involves the carrying of shipping containers

05:41.740 --> 05:43.620
to and from their destinations.

05:43.620 --> 05:47.820
Generally, trains will carry these containers as only a step in their overall journey.

05:47.820 --> 05:51.780
For example, a container might be picked up from a factory in Shenzhen, China, brought

05:51.780 --> 05:55.540
by truck to the port of Shenzhen, loaded on a ship to Long Beach, California, moved

05:55.540 --> 05:59.720
onto a train to Omaha, Nebraska, before being loaded again on a truck for its final journey

05:59.720 --> 06:01.220
to Norfolk, Nebraska.

06:01.220 --> 06:05.140
Generally, railroads will have their intermodal terminals, where containers are unloaded and

06:05.140 --> 06:10.100
loaded, spread out about 300 to 500 miles or 500 to 800 kilometers apart from each other

06:10.100 --> 06:14.600
so the greatest area can be reached within a day's truck drive from one of their terminals.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.620
Given the lackluster nature of the US's passenger railways, it may surprise some that

06:18.620 --> 06:22.580
the country's freight railway system is considered among the world's best.

06:22.580 --> 06:26.720
The country is just in that sweet spot of economically busy and spread out that supports

06:26.720 --> 06:28.320
the use of freight trains.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.660
It therefore serves as a good example to examine to explain how freight trains work worldwide.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.620
The US's network is quite extensive.

06:35.620 --> 06:40.700
As an example, Kansas, whose entire passenger rail network consists of this, has a freight

06:40.700 --> 06:42.420
rail network of this.

06:42.420 --> 06:46.380
What helps is that in most countries the government builds tracks primarily for passenger train

06:46.380 --> 06:49.180
usage and freight operators pay to use them.

06:49.180 --> 06:51.460
In the US, though, it's the other way around.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.360
In most cases, the track is owned by freight operators and the government pays them to

06:55.360 --> 06:57.720
use it for passenger operations.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.460
Through many years of consolidation, seven major freight railroads have emerged in North

07:01.460 --> 07:07.260
America each with their own territory—Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian

07:07.260 --> 07:10.620
National, Canadian Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.

07:10.620 --> 07:15.020
With the exception of Canadian National, none operates coast to coast so for longer journeys,

07:15.020 --> 07:18.300
a single operator could not get freight from start to finish.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.940
Now, take a look at this BNSF train.

07:20.940 --> 07:25.100
You'll notice at the end it's hauling a CSX car and a Union Pacific car.

07:25.100 --> 07:29.660
That's because, since no one railroad covers the entire continent, different ones work

07:29.660 --> 07:32.300
together to get freight to its final destination.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.660
A container traveling from Oakland, California to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for example,

07:36.660 --> 07:40.220
would be first brought to Lathrop, California where Union Pacific has a rail yard.

07:40.220 --> 07:43.700
It would then be taken off the truck and loaded onto an eastbound train.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.180
After passing through the western United States and arriving in Chicago, the container

07:47.180 --> 07:51.540
would then be removed, hauled short distance from the Union Pacific to the CSX terminal,

07:51.540 --> 07:56.440
and placed on a CSX train since Chicago is as far east as Union Pacific goes.

07:56.440 --> 07:59.700
That train would then take it to Kearny, New Jersey, near New York City where it would

07:59.700 --> 08:03.980
then be loaded on another truck to take it to its final destination in Philadelphia.

08:03.980 --> 08:07.060
This is already complicated, but it can get even more.

08:07.060 --> 08:10.540
Sometimes different railroads don't partner or won't allow for seamless transfers between

08:10.540 --> 08:12.500
certain origin and destination pairs.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.940
Chicago, for example, has dozens of different rail yards used by different railroads so

08:16.940 --> 08:21.380
in order to get a container through one might have to book a spot on one train to the city,

08:21.380 --> 08:25.740
then book a transfer by truck from one terminal to that of another railroad, then book separately

08:25.740 --> 08:27.900
the next train out of the city.

08:27.900 --> 08:31.800
This increases complexity enormously and it's often difficult to find truck drivers willing

08:31.800 --> 08:35.580
to make the short cross-town trip especially given the current shortage of truck drivers

08:35.580 --> 08:37.020
in the US.

08:37.020 --> 08:40.480
Many of these complexities are handled by logistics companies hired by clients to manage

08:40.480 --> 08:43.920
the movement of their freight, but these interchanges can still slow down shipping

08:43.920 --> 08:45.800
times significantly.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.880
There is this constant battle between the trucking and rail industry.

08:49.880 --> 08:53.700
Hired rail lobbyists in the US constantly work against the trucking industry by dissuading

08:53.700 --> 08:56.680
Congress from increasing weight and size limits of trucks.

08:56.680 --> 09:00.520
With a nearly global shortage of truck drivers, though, railroads are at an advantage right

09:00.520 --> 09:02.680
now and many are thriving.

09:02.680 --> 09:06.600
New railroads are constantly under construction worldwide, especially in developing nations,

09:06.600 --> 09:08.600
and the industry is growing.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.520
It's not completely safe, though.

09:10.520 --> 09:14.240
The advent of driverless trucks will surely reduce costs and increase capacity in the

09:14.240 --> 09:17.960
trucking industry which could tilt favor over to the rubber tires.

09:17.960 --> 09:22.680
In addition, coal is one of the most commonly carried goods by freight trains and, as the

09:22.680 --> 09:27.940
world transitions towards renewable energy, there could be less demand for its transportation.

09:27.940 --> 09:31.880
Overall though, at least until there's a monumental shift in technology, freight trains

09:31.880 --> 09:37.920
will continue to be the proven method for moving freight long distances over land.

09:38.240 --> 09:41.840
If you want to learn how to make videos just like this one There are a few things you'll

09:41.840 --> 09:42.840

You'll have to learn how to animate.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.200
Skillshare has a class for that.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.960
In fact, if there's something you want to learn, there's a pretty decent chance that

10:00.960 --> 10:03.340
Skillshare has a class for that.
