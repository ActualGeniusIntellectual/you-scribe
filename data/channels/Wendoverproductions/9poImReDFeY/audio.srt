3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,080
If you look at the list of the world's twelve largest economies, there's a clear split.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,120
Six are relatively small countries where one could never be more than a few hundred miles

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,940
or kilometers from the ocean.

6
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:25,080
The other six—the United States, China, India, Brazil, Canada, and Russia—are enormous

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,720
countries with spots more than a thousand miles or 1,600 kilometers from the ocean.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,680
It's well known that ships are the main method of transport for freight globally thanks

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,100
to their low cost.

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,480
In fact, 90% of world trade goes by sea.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,760
While most of the population lives relatively near the ocean, there are still plenty of

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,200
populated areas far inland that too need a method of low-cost freight transport.

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,160
For that, there's freight trains.

14
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,780
Most surprisingly, those six physically largest of the twelve largest economies are, rearranged

15
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,520
in order, the world's six top users of freight rail transport.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,880
To understand the role of freight rail, you have to look at the numbers.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,440
In the US it costs, on average, about 4 cents to move one ton of freight, the weight of

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,120
a small car, one mile on a freight train.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,880
That's about 2.5 cents per ton kilometer.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,460
What that means is that, on average, you could move one ton of freight coast to coast, from

21
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,140
New York to Los Angeles, on a train for about $100.

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,640
It's worth noting that freight rail prices in the US are among the lowest in the world.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,900
In most European countries, for example, they're nearly double.

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,780
In comparison to those 4 cents per mile, air freight transport in the US costs about 121

25
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,460
cents per ton mile or 75 cents per ton kilometer but air freight is not truly a competitor

26
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,860
to the railways.

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,400
Planes will tend to carry time-sensitive or valuable goods while trains will carry lower

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,740
value or less time-sensitive goods.

29
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,840
The true competitor to trains are trucks which carry a ton a mile at a cost of around 20

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,100
cents or 13 cents per ton kilometer.

31
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,120
This is noticeably higher but trucks, of course, can go anywhere.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,120
Trains can only go where there are tracks.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,040
Now, the reason why trains are so cheap is because they are quite a bit more efficient

34
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
than trucks.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,840
In 2017, Union Pacific Railroad, as an example, moved freight a total of 471 billion ton miles.

36
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,400
That's the total number of miles multiplied by the total number of tons moved.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,960
To do that, they used just over 1 billion gallons of diesel fuel meaning it took, on

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,040
average, only one gallon of fuel to move one ton of freight 469 miles.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
That's far more efficient than a truck.

40
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,520
The reason behind this is simple—trains encounter less resistance.

41
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,500
Their smooth steel wheels run over smooth steel tracks so there's very little friction

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,280
compared to rubber truck tires running over the road.

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,580
In addition, since the train's just one long line, there's much less wind resistance

44
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,240
per ton than a truck.

45
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,480
A single locomotive uses huge amounts of fuel but can have upwards of 6,000 horsepower and

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,560
can therefore pull a huge number of cars.

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,640
On average, in the US, freight trains are about 6,500 feet or 2,000 meters long.

48
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,060
They can get longer, though.

49
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,580
In Canada, Canadian National regularly runs 14,000 feet or 4,300 meter long trains.

50
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,300
It would take nearly an hour to walk from one end of this train to the other.

51
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,140
Typically, it only takes two people to run even these multi-mile long freight trains.

52
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,860
Considering that most trucks take one person to transport one container and these trains

53
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,120
can carry hundreds, it's easy to see the advantage.

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,740
In some cases, freight trains are even run by only one individual—the driver.

55
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,480
Of course there are plenty of safety concerns with that but railroads are increasingly doing

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,740
so as it cuts down on cost.

57
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,200
Overall, what this means is that freight trains are quite comparatively efficient both economically

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,780
and environmentally to other means of land transport.

59
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,740
Within the cab of a locomotive, there's generally not much other than the train controls,

60
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,900
a few seats, and a small lavatory.

61
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,820
There are no beds or other accommodations because crews don't stay on board for all

62
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,000
that long.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,300
Every driver and conductor in a company works a defined territory along the overall train

64
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,140
route so for longer runs, such as BNSF's route from Seattle to Chicago, for example,

65
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,740
it takes ten different crews to make the trip.

66
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,980
The first takes the train from Seattle to Wenatchee, Washington, then switches with

67
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,140
another crew that takes us to Spokane, Washington, and then this crew swap process repeats itself

68
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:20,460
in Whitefish, Haver, Glasgow, Minot, East Dilworth, Northtown, and North La Crosse before

69
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,360
the train arrives in Chicago.

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,460
In most cases, crews will typically live at one end of their territory, work the train

71
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,600
to the other end, stay in a hotel overnight, then swap with an inbound crew to take command

72
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,740
of a train headed back to where they live.

73
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,780
Now, under US law, each crew is only allowed to work for up to 12 hours at a time before

74
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,620
needing a rest period and so these territories where crew work are designed to be able to

75
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,880
be completed in those 12 hours.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,580
For longer sections, though, like the 276 mile, 444 kilometer section from Glasgow to

77
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,980
Minot, there's increased risk of timing out in case of slowdown.

78
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,020
If a train crew reaches 12 hours, they quite literally have to stop in their tracks and

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,420
wait until another crew arrives.

80
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,440
Eventually the railroad will drive out a relief crew from the next stop, in this case Minot,

81
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
to take over.

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,060
Now, there are two major types of cargo transported by rail—bulk and intermodal.

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,980
Bulk cargo is things like grain, stone, sand, oil, and coal.

84
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:19,100
Coal, along with most bulk cargo, is not a value-dense product, as in, it costs a little

85
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,620
to get a lot.

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,420
In the US, a ton of coal costs only $34 on average so of course you need to put it on

87
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:29,740
the lowest cost transport method possible which in many cases is trains.

88
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,740
Trains both serve to bring coal from the mine to their domestic destinations, mostly power

89
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,660
plants, and to coastal ports to be loaded on ships for international export.

90
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,740
The other major type of freight, intermodal, involves the carrying of shipping containers

91
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,620
to and from their destinations.

92
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,820
Generally, trains will carry these containers as only a step in their overall journey.

93
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,780
For example, a container might be picked up from a factory in Shenzhen, China, brought

94
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,540
by truck to the port of Shenzhen, loaded on a ship to Long Beach, California, moved

95
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,720
onto a train to Omaha, Nebraska, before being loaded again on a truck for its final journey

96
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,220
to Norfolk, Nebraska.

97
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,140
Generally, railroads will have their intermodal terminals, where containers are unloaded and

98
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,100
loaded, spread out about 300 to 500 miles or 500 to 800 kilometers apart from each other

99
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,600
so the greatest area can be reached within a day's truck drive from one of their terminals.

100
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,620
Given the lackluster nature of the US's passenger railways, it may surprise some that

101
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,580
the country's freight railway system is considered among the world's best.

102
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,720
The country is just in that sweet spot of economically busy and spread out that supports

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,320
the use of freight trains.

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,660
It therefore serves as a good example to examine to explain how freight trains work worldwide.

105
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,620
The US's network is quite extensive.

106
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,700
As an example, Kansas, whose entire passenger rail network consists of this, has a freight

107
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,420
rail network of this.

108
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,380
What helps is that in most countries the government builds tracks primarily for passenger train

109
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,180
usage and freight operators pay to use them.

110
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,460
In the US, though, it's the other way around.

111
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,360
In most cases, the track is owned by freight operators and the government pays them to

112
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,720
use it for passenger operations.

113
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,460
Through many years of consolidation, seven major freight railroads have emerged in North

114
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:07,260
America each with their own territory—Union Pacific, BNSF, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian

115
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,620
National, Canadian Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.

116
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:15,020
With the exception of Canadian National, none operates coast to coast so for longer journeys,

117
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,300
a single operator could not get freight from start to finish.

118
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,940
Now, take a look at this BNSF train.

119
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,100
You'll notice at the end it's hauling a CSX car and a Union Pacific car.

120
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,660
That's because, since no one railroad covers the entire continent, different ones work

121
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,300
together to get freight to its final destination.

122
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,660
A container traveling from Oakland, California to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for example,

123
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,220
would be first brought to Lathrop, California where Union Pacific has a rail yard.

124
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,700
It would then be taken off the truck and loaded onto an eastbound train.

125
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,180
After passing through the western United States and arriving in Chicago, the container

126
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,540
would then be removed, hauled short distance from the Union Pacific to the CSX terminal,

127
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,440
and placed on a CSX train since Chicago is as far east as Union Pacific goes.

128
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,700
That train would then take it to Kearny, New Jersey, near New York City where it would

129
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,980
then be loaded on another truck to take it to its final destination in Philadelphia.

130
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,060
This is already complicated, but it can get even more.

131
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,540
Sometimes different railroads don't partner or won't allow for seamless transfers between

132
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,500
certain origin and destination pairs.

133
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,940
Chicago, for example, has dozens of different rail yards used by different railroads so

134
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,380
in order to get a container through one might have to book a spot on one train to the city,

135
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,740
then book a transfer by truck from one terminal to that of another railroad, then book separately

136
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,900
the next train out of the city.

137
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,800
This increases complexity enormously and it's often difficult to find truck drivers willing

138
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,580
to make the short cross-town trip especially given the current shortage of truck drivers

139
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,020
in the US.

140
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,480
Many of these complexities are handled by logistics companies hired by clients to manage

141
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,920
the movement of their freight, but these interchanges can still slow down shipping

142
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,800
times significantly.

143
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,880
There is this constant battle between the trucking and rail industry.

144
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,700
Hired rail lobbyists in the US constantly work against the trucking industry by dissuading

145
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,680
Congress from increasing weight and size limits of trucks.

146
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,520
With a nearly global shortage of truck drivers, though, railroads are at an advantage right

147
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,680
now and many are thriving.

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,600
New railroads are constantly under construction worldwide, especially in developing nations,

149
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
and the industry is growing.

150
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,520
It's not completely safe, though.

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,240
The advent of driverless trucks will surely reduce costs and increase capacity in the

152
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,960
trucking industry which could tilt favor over to the rubber tires.

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,680
In addition, coal is one of the most commonly carried goods by freight trains and, as the

154
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,940
world transitions towards renewable energy, there could be less demand for its transportation.

155
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,880
Overall though, at least until there's a monumental shift in technology, freight trains

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,920
will continue to be the proven method for moving freight long distances over land.

157
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,840
If you want to learn how to make videos just like this one There are a few things you'll

158
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,840
have to learn.

159
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,200
You'll have to learn how to write non-fiction effectively.

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
