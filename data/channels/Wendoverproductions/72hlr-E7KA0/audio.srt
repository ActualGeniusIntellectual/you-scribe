4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,360
Airline ticket pricing probably seems like a crapshoot.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
The numbers change seemingly arbitrarily every week, day, or hour, but there's some real

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,940
science behind these prices.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,840
People spend their whole lives figuring out what to charge you to fly.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's take a look at one flight on one route by one airline to understand.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
American Flight 33 leaves New York's JFK airport every day at 7am bound for Los Angeles

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
arriving at 10.51am pacific time.

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,120
This transcontinental route is one of the most competitive in the world with over 3.5

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,360
million yearly passengers and five major airlines connecting the country's two largest cities.

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,120
There's nowhere where pricing strategies are more important for airlines than here.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,800
Looking at three months of fares for this flight, there are eight distinct prices for

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,240
economy ranging from $129 to $472.

16
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,820
These all get you on the exact same flight in the exact same seat but each and every

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,320
price has a purpose and place.

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,840
The lowest price, $129, is the most competitive price.

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,360
This fare only shows up three times in our three month span—each time on Tuesdays.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,300
Now, Tuesdays are very often the cheapest days of the week to fly.

21
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,960
Business travelers tend to make up much of the demand during the week and they most often

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,040
want to fly out on Monday and return on Thursdays or Fridays so Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays

23
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,000
tend to be the most expensive travel days while Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
cheapest.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,560
The average ticket price for this flight shows this.

26
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,920
Tuesdays average $182 and Wednesdays $173.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,620
Even if the demand is lower, American Airlines runs this flight anyways and they have to

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,940
feel seized to break even so they sell this flight at rock bottom prices.

29
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,660
The next price, $144, actually demonstrates a very interesting phenomenon.

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,020
Whenever American prices their flight at $144, they are not alone.

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,800
Take March 6th, for example.

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,020
American, Delta, Virgin America, JetBlue, and United all have flights from New York

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,660
to LA at around 7 in the morning selling for $144.

34
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,140
They're doing what is called price matching.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,380
Because this is one of the most competitive routes in the world and because the number

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,420
one determinant for travelers on which airline they take is price, all five airlines flying

37
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,100
this route match each other's prices.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,020
This way, travelers make their decision based off the reputation of each airline rather

39
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,220
than the price.

40
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,300
The price stays at $144 because it's in each airline's best interest to keep it

41
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,300
there.

42
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,260
In a normal market, if Delta, for example, dropped their price to $119 they would get

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,080
more travelers since they were the cheapest, but in this price matched market, all the

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,780
other airlines would drop their prices as soon as Delta drops theirs so all of them

45
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,180
would get the same amount of travelers as before while earning less money.

46
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,620
But there are some cases where it can make business sense for airlines to drop prices

47
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,300
to below even being profitable.

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,460
In the year 2000, WestJet and the now defunct Canjet airlines started flying from central

49
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,420
Canada to Newfoundland.

50
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:23,440
These routes were historically operated exclusively by Air Canada and they were expensive.

51
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,380
A one-way flight from Montreal in 1999 cost over $600 but when the budget airlines WestJet

52
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:36,100
and Canjet started flying the route prices dropped dramatically and Air Canada was threatened

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,260
so they dropped their prices even lower.

54
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,260
The $600 Air Canada fares then cost $89.

55
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,420
Now it wouldn't make sense for anyone to fly a budget airline over Air Canada at the

56
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,460
same price so WestJet and Canjet were almost driven out of business on these routes until

57
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,700
Canada's competition bureau stepped in.

58
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,700
They concluded that Air Canada was engaging in the uncompetitive action of predatory pricing

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,900
since they were pricing flights below what it cost to operate them so they were forced

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,080
to stop.

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,200
Airlines in the US, with some newly strong budget competitors, are engaging in similar

62
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,880
actions nowadays.

63
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,460
United Airlines, for example, is matching Frontier's $40 fares on many days from Denver

64
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,120
to Chicago, among other routes, in order to maintain their market stronghold in Denver

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,580
and Chicago even though their cost to operate the route is drastically higher than Frontier

66
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:32,100
so they are almost certainly losing money on those fares.

67
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,200
But back to the New York to LA route, $159 is the lowest regular fare for this flight.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,540
The $129 and $144 price points were both basic economy fares—the most restrictive type

69
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,100
with no seat selection, no carry-on bags, and no changes or refunds.

70
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,740
Every flight has a bunch of different booking classes each with a fare code.

71
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:01,280
For example, the basic economy fare code for the $129 and $144 price is B but the $159 price

72
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,520
books into fare code N. These different booking classes are sometimes known as fare buckets.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,480
Essentially, the airline decides it's going to sell a certain number of tickets at the

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,400
$159 price with fare code N—let's say 10.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,820
Then when those 10 tickets are sold the airline then sells economy at fare code G for $204

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,520
then when those are sold it sells economy at fare code V for $269 then fare code L for

77
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,820
$318 and so on and so forth.

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,220
There are also some cases where a ticket will default to a more expensive fare bucket because

79
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,340
of reasons other than the lower fare selling out.

80
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:40,820
Many fares, including each mentioned so far, have advance purchase requirements meaning

81
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,980
that, even if a flight is not full at all, the price will increase closer to departure.

82
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,100
All the fares below $204 have an advance purchase requirement of two weeks meaning that you

83
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,620
can only purchase them more than two weeks before departure while the $269 fare, for

84
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,120
example, has an advance purchase requirement of only one week.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,660
Although, the cheapest fare without an advance purchase requirement at all, that is, the

86
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:11,140
cheapest fare that you could buy day of for this flight is fare class K at $472 which

87
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,940
happens to be the most expensive economy class fare.

88
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,060
And now for some caveats.

89
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,140
Not every fare for this flight is going to be priced at one of these eight prices.

90
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,060
Airlines have mechanisms to adjust fares from these buckets.

91
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,060
In the short term, they can adjust things like the fuel surcharge to raise the price

92
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,160
if other factors, like oil prices, increase.

93
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,540
In the long term, they can adjust the actual prices of the different fare buckets.

94
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,360
Airlines often increase the base fares for busy seasons like summer.

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,080
American Airlines does exactly that on this New York to LA route where their fare class

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,780
M, for example, increases from $357 to $410 in August.

97
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,300
So far we've looked at this on a micro-level—how prices differ on one flight—but we also

98
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,660
have to consider the macro-level.

99
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:07,280
Why if you leave on Tuesday, February 6th and fly 2,469 miles to the west to LA do you

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:15,360
pay $129 while if you fly 3,442 miles to the east to London, only a thousand miles further

101
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,500
than LA, you pay $2,772?

102
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:25,420
Well, the second figure is a bit deceptive because that's the price of a one-way ticket.

103
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,940
If you switch the LA flight to a round-trip ticket returning a week later it will cost

104
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,660
$257—exactly double—while if you turn the London flight into a round-trip returning

105
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:41,220
a week later the price will drop to $602—almost five times less.

106
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,980
This is understandably confusing—a one-way ticket more expensive than a round-trip—but

107
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,260
the reason this is goes back to the fare codes.

108
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Embedded within each fare code are a bunch of little restrictions that dictate when you

109
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,900
can use that fare.

110
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,620
On the New York to LA trip those restrictions are just things like blackout dates for the

111
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,280
fare and advance purchase requirements, but the New York to London ticket has loads more

112
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,100
restrictions and the ones that make one-ways more expensive than round-trips are the minimum

113
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,800
stay requirements.

114
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,640
These requirements dictate how soon your return flight can be in order to get a particular

115
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,640
fare.

116
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,960
The idea is to price discriminate—business travelers should pay more because they can

117
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
pay more.

118
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,180
Meanwhile, airlines try to give the lowest prices to leisure travelers since they're

119
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,720
the ones paying for their own tickets and therefore they're the ones that are the

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,820
most price sensitive.

121
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,440
Business travelers often want to be home for the weekend so many of these minimum stay

122
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,200
requirements, like with fares Q, N, and S, just require a Sunday at your destination.

123
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,920
Others, trying to accomplish the same thing, require seven days—a full week—which would

124
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,360
also require a traveler to stay the weekend at their destination.

125
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,160
Now, as the prices go up the requirements go down so once you get to paying around $2,000

126
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,680
you can stay for as few as three days, but the cheapest round-trip base airfare with

127
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:09,980
no stay requirement at all is $5,544 in fare class Y—exactly double the one-way price.

128
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,540
So that explains this.

129
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,180
The one-way ticket is so expensive because, since the airline doesn't know how long

130
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:20,600
the traveler will stay at their destination, the one-way fare has to be booked into the

131
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,120
least restrictive fare class without the minimum stay requirement.

132
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,160
You'll see this idea of price discrimination all over ticketing structures.

133
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,240
It's a genius pricing concept that allows different people to buy products at the prices

134
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,320
they can afford and therefore it allows businesses to sell the same product to more people.

135
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,160
Tickets increase in price closer to departure because leisure travelers buy tickets far

136
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,300
out and business travelers buy their tickets close to departure and flexible tickets are

137
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,340
more expensive because that's what business travelers need, but there's another pricing

138
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,240
difference going on that's less fair—between routes.

139
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,120
It's all about competition.

140
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,880
Different routes of the same distance cost different amounts generally not because they

141
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,040
cost different amounts to operate, but because of how much the competitors are charging.

142
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,260
This is part of why flights into small airports are so expensive—because they lack competition.

143
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:20,560
You can fly the 240 miles from Detroit to Pelston, Michigan on a CRJ200 for $242 or

144
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,840
you can fly the 170 miles from Detroit to South Bend, Indiana on a CRJ200 for $76.

145
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,760
The only difference is that South Bend Airport has flights from United, Delta, and Allegiant

146
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,660
while Pelston only has flights from Delta.

147
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,080
The same phenomenon happens over the Atlantic.

148
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,560
There's more competition on the six hour flight from New York to LA than on the six

149
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,300
hour flight from New York to Dublin so you can fly to LA for $250 round trip while Dublin

150
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,560
costs $500 round trip.

151
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,980
Of course, travelers from New York to LA can drive, take the bus, take the train, or take

152
00:10:53,980 --> 00:11:00,340
a flight connecting halfway there while travelers to Dublin only have one choice—to fly.

153
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,540
In all, the truth is that prices reflect what people will pay and so people will pay what

154
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,620
flights are priced.

155
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,420
If you're a busy person like me you know that eating healthy can be difficult.

156
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,820
Sometimes it seems like you have two choices—quick food or healthy food—but you have another

157
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,260
one—quick and healthy food because that's what Blue Apron is.

158
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,300
Blue Apron ships you boxes every week with farm-fresh pre-apportioned ingredients and
