00:10.360 --> 00:13.360
Airline ticket pricing probably seems like a crapshoot.

00:13.360 --> 00:18.160
The numbers change seemingly arbitrarily every week, day, or hour, but there's some real

00:18.160 --> 00:20.940
science behind these prices.

00:20.940 --> 00:24.840
People spend their whole lives figuring out what to charge you to fly.

00:24.840 --> 00:30.000
Let's take a look at one flight on one route by one airline to understand.

00:30.000 --> 00:35.520
American Flight 33 leaves New York's JFK airport every day at 7am bound for Los Angeles

00:35.520 --> 00:38.640
arriving at 10.51am pacific time.

00:38.640 --> 00:44.120
This transcontinental route is one of the most competitive in the world with over 3.5

00:44.120 --> 00:49.360
million yearly passengers and five major airlines connecting the country's two largest cities.

00:49.360 --> 00:54.120
There's nowhere where pricing strategies are more important for airlines than here.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.800
Looking at three months of fares for this flight, there are eight distinct prices for

00:57.800 --> 01:02.240
economy ranging from $129 to $472.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.820
These all get you on the exact same flight in the exact same seat but each and every

01:06.820 --> 01:09.320
price has a purpose and place.

01:09.320 --> 01:13.840
The lowest price, $129, is the most competitive price.

01:13.840 --> 01:19.360
This fare only shows up three times in our three month span—each time on Tuesdays.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.300
Now, Tuesdays are very often the cheapest days of the week to fly.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.960
Business travelers tend to make up much of the demand during the week and they most often

01:27.960 --> 01:34.040
want to fly out on Monday and return on Thursdays or Fridays so Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays

01:34.040 --> 01:39.000
tend to be the most expensive travel days while Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
cheapest.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.560
The average ticket price for this flight shows this.

01:42.560 --> 01:46.920
Tuesdays average $182 and Wednesdays $173.

01:46.920 --> 01:51.620
Even if the demand is lower, American Airlines runs this flight anyways and they have to

01:51.620 --> 01:56.940
feel seized to break even so they sell this flight at rock bottom prices.

01:56.940 --> 02:02.660
The next price, $144, actually demonstrates a very interesting phenomenon.

02:02.660 --> 02:08.020
Whenever American prices their flight at $144, they are not alone.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.800
Take March 6th, for example.

02:09.800 --> 02:14.020
American, Delta, Virgin America, JetBlue, and United all have flights from New York

02:14.020 --> 02:17.660
to LA at around 7 in the morning selling for $144.

02:17.660 --> 02:21.140
They're doing what is called price matching.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.380
Because this is one of the most competitive routes in the world and because the number

02:24.380 --> 02:29.420
one determinant for travelers on which airline they take is price, all five airlines flying

02:29.420 --> 02:32.100
this route match each other's prices.

02:32.100 --> 02:37.020
This way, travelers make their decision based off the reputation of each airline rather

02:37.020 --> 02:38.220
than the price.

02:38.220 --> 02:43.300
The price stays at $144 because it's in each airline's best interest to keep it

02:43.300 --> 02:44.300
there.

02:44.300 --> 02:49.260
In a normal market, if Delta, for example, dropped their price to $119 they would get

02:49.260 --> 02:54.080
more travelers since they were the cheapest, but in this price matched market, all the

02:54.080 --> 02:58.780
other airlines would drop their prices as soon as Delta drops theirs so all of them

02:58.780 --> 03:03.180
would get the same amount of travelers as before while earning less money.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.620
But there are some cases where it can make business sense for airlines to drop prices

03:07.620 --> 03:10.300
to below even being profitable.

03:10.300 --> 03:15.460
In the year 2000, WestJet and the now defunct Canjet airlines started flying from central

03:15.460 --> 03:17.420
Canada to Newfoundland.

03:17.420 --> 03:23.440
These routes were historically operated exclusively by Air Canada and they were expensive.

03:23.440 --> 03:30.380
A one-way flight from Montreal in 1999 cost over $600 but when the budget airlines WestJet

03:30.380 --> 03:36.100
and Canjet started flying the route prices dropped dramatically and Air Canada was threatened

03:36.100 --> 03:39.260
so they dropped their prices even lower.

03:39.260 --> 03:44.260
The $600 Air Canada fares then cost $89.

03:44.260 --> 03:48.420
Now it wouldn't make sense for anyone to fly a budget airline over Air Canada at the

03:48.420 --> 03:54.460
same price so WestJet and Canjet were almost driven out of business on these routes until

03:54.460 --> 03:56.700
Canada's competition bureau stepped in.

03:56.700 --> 04:01.700
They concluded that Air Canada was engaging in the uncompetitive action of predatory pricing

04:01.700 --> 04:05.900
since they were pricing flights below what it cost to operate them so they were forced

04:05.900 --> 04:07.080
to stop.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.200
Airlines in the US, with some newly strong budget competitors, are engaging in similar

04:11.200 --> 04:12.880
actions nowadays.

04:12.880 --> 04:18.460
United Airlines, for example, is matching Frontier's $40 fares on many days from Denver

04:18.460 --> 04:23.120
to Chicago, among other routes, in order to maintain their market stronghold in Denver

04:23.120 --> 04:28.580
and Chicago even though their cost to operate the route is drastically higher than Frontier

04:28.580 --> 04:32.100
so they are almost certainly losing money on those fares.

04:32.100 --> 04:38.200
But back to the New York to LA route, $159 is the lowest regular fare for this flight.

04:38.200 --> 04:44.540
The $129 and $144 price points were both basic economy fares—the most restrictive type

04:44.540 --> 04:49.100
with no seat selection, no carry-on bags, and no changes or refunds.

04:49.100 --> 04:53.740
Every flight has a bunch of different booking classes each with a fare code.

04:53.740 --> 05:01.280
For example, the basic economy fare code for the $129 and $144 price is B but the $159 price

05:01.280 --> 05:06.520
books into fare code N. These different booking classes are sometimes known as fare buckets.

05:06.520 --> 05:10.480
Essentially, the airline decides it's going to sell a certain number of tickets at the

05:10.480 --> 05:14.400
$159 price with fare code N—let's say 10.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.820
Then when those 10 tickets are sold the airline then sells economy at fare code G for $204

05:19.820 --> 05:25.520
then when those are sold it sells economy at fare code V for $269 then fare code L for

05:25.520 --> 05:28.820
$318 and so on and so forth.

05:28.820 --> 05:33.220
There are also some cases where a ticket will default to a more expensive fare bucket because

05:33.220 --> 05:36.340
of reasons other than the lower fare selling out.

05:36.340 --> 05:40.820
Many fares, including each mentioned so far, have advance purchase requirements meaning

05:40.820 --> 05:45.980
that, even if a flight is not full at all, the price will increase closer to departure.

05:45.980 --> 05:51.100
All the fares below $204 have an advance purchase requirement of two weeks meaning that you

05:51.100 --> 05:56.620
can only purchase them more than two weeks before departure while the $269 fare, for

05:56.620 --> 06:00.120
example, has an advance purchase requirement of only one week.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.660
Although, the cheapest fare without an advance purchase requirement at all, that is, the

06:04.660 --> 06:11.140
cheapest fare that you could buy day of for this flight is fare class K at $472 which

06:11.140 --> 06:14.940
happens to be the most expensive economy class fare.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.060
And now for some caveats.

06:17.060 --> 06:22.140
Not every fare for this flight is going to be priced at one of these eight prices.

06:22.140 --> 06:26.060
Airlines have mechanisms to adjust fares from these buckets.

06:26.060 --> 06:30.060
In the short term, they can adjust things like the fuel surcharge to raise the price

06:30.060 --> 06:33.160
if other factors, like oil prices, increase.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.540
In the long term, they can adjust the actual prices of the different fare buckets.

06:37.540 --> 06:41.360
Airlines often increase the base fares for busy seasons like summer.

06:41.360 --> 06:46.080
American Airlines does exactly that on this New York to LA route where their fare class

06:46.080 --> 06:52.780
M, for example, increases from $357 to $410 in August.

06:52.940 --> 06:58.300
So far we've looked at this on a micro-level—how prices differ on one flight—but we also

06:58.300 --> 07:00.660
have to consider the macro-level.

07:00.660 --> 07:07.280
Why if you leave on Tuesday, February 6th and fly 2,469 miles to the west to LA do you

07:07.280 --> 07:15.360
pay $129 while if you fly 3,442 miles to the east to London, only a thousand miles further

07:15.360 --> 07:18.500
than LA, you pay $2,772?

07:18.500 --> 07:25.420
Well, the second figure is a bit deceptive because that's the price of a one-way ticket.

07:25.420 --> 07:29.940
If you switch the LA flight to a round-trip ticket returning a week later it will cost

07:29.940 --> 07:35.660
$257—exactly double—while if you turn the London flight into a round-trip returning

07:35.660 --> 07:41.220
a week later the price will drop to $602—almost five times less.

07:41.220 --> 07:45.980
This is understandably confusing—a one-way ticket more expensive than a round-trip—but

07:45.980 --> 07:49.260
the reason this is goes back to the fare codes.

07:49.260 --> 07:54.260
Embedded within each fare code are a bunch of little restrictions that dictate when you

07:54.260 --> 07:55.900
can use that fare.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.620
On the New York to LA trip those restrictions are just things like blackout dates for the

07:59.620 --> 08:04.280
fare and advance purchase requirements, but the New York to London ticket has loads more

08:04.280 --> 08:09.100
restrictions and the ones that make one-ways more expensive than round-trips are the minimum

08:09.100 --> 08:10.800
stay requirements.

08:10.800 --> 08:16.640
These requirements dictate how soon your return flight can be in order to get a particular

08:16.640 --> 08:17.640
fare.

08:17.640 --> 08:21.960
The idea is to price discriminate—business travelers should pay more because they can

08:21.960 --> 08:22.960
pay more.

08:22.960 --> 08:27.180
Meanwhile, airlines try to give the lowest prices to leisure travelers since they're

08:27.180 --> 08:30.720
the ones paying for their own tickets and therefore they're the ones that are the

08:30.720 --> 08:32.820
most price sensitive.

08:32.820 --> 08:36.440
Business travelers often want to be home for the weekend so many of these minimum stay

08:36.440 --> 08:42.200
requirements, like with fares Q, N, and S, just require a Sunday at your destination.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.920
Others, trying to accomplish the same thing, require seven days—a full week—which would

08:46.920 --> 08:50.360
also require a traveler to stay the weekend at their destination.

08:50.360 --> 08:56.160
Now, as the prices go up the requirements go down so once you get to paying around $2,000

08:56.160 --> 09:00.680
you can stay for as few as three days, but the cheapest round-trip base airfare with

09:00.680 --> 09:09.980
no stay requirement at all is $5,544 in fare class Y—exactly double the one-way price.

09:09.980 --> 09:11.540
So that explains this.

09:11.540 --> 09:16.180
The one-way ticket is so expensive because, since the airline doesn't know how long

09:16.180 --> 09:20.600
the traveler will stay at their destination, the one-way fare has to be booked into the

09:20.600 --> 09:24.120
least restrictive fare class without the minimum stay requirement.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.160
You'll see this idea of price discrimination all over ticketing structures.

09:28.640 --> 09:33.240
It's a genius pricing concept that allows different people to buy products at the prices

09:33.240 --> 09:39.320
they can afford and therefore it allows businesses to sell the same product to more people.

09:39.320 --> 09:43.160
Tickets increase in price closer to departure because leisure travelers buy tickets far

09:43.160 --> 09:47.300
out and business travelers buy their tickets close to departure and flexible tickets are

09:47.300 --> 09:51.340
more expensive because that's what business travelers need, but there's another pricing

09:51.340 --> 09:55.240
difference going on that's less fair—between routes.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.120
It's all about competition.

09:58.120 --> 10:01.880
Different routes of the same distance cost different amounts generally not because they

10:01.880 --> 10:07.040
cost different amounts to operate, but because of how much the competitors are charging.

10:07.040 --> 10:13.260
This is part of why flights into small airports are so expensive—because they lack competition.

10:13.260 --> 10:20.560
You can fly the 240 miles from Detroit to Pelston, Michigan on a CRJ200 for $242 or

10:20.560 --> 10:26.840
you can fly the 170 miles from Detroit to South Bend, Indiana on a CRJ200 for $76.

10:26.840 --> 10:31.760
The only difference is that South Bend Airport has flights from United, Delta, and Allegiant

10:31.760 --> 10:34.660
while Pelston only has flights from Delta.

10:34.660 --> 10:37.080
The same phenomenon happens over the Atlantic.

10:37.080 --> 10:41.560
There's more competition on the six hour flight from New York to LA than on the six

10:41.560 --> 10:47.300
hour flight from New York to Dublin so you can fly to LA for $250 round trip while Dublin

10:47.300 --> 10:49.560
costs $500 round trip.

10:49.560 --> 10:53.980
Of course, travelers from New York to LA can drive, take the bus, take the train, or take

10:53.980 --> 11:00.340
a flight connecting halfway there while travelers to Dublin only have one choice—to fly.

11:00.340 --> 11:05.540
In all, the truth is that prices reflect what people will pay and so people will pay what

11:05.540 --> 11:07.620
flights are priced.

11:07.620 --> 11:11.420
If you're a busy person like me you know that eating healthy can be difficult.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.820
Sometimes it seems like you have two choices—quick food or healthy food—but you have another

11:15.820 --> 11:20.260
one—quick and healthy food because that's what Blue Apron is.

11:20.260 --> 11:24.300

11:29.340 --> 11:34.580
I recently made the spicy pork and Korean rice cakes meal which was delicious and quick.

11:34.580 --> 11:37.860
With Blue Apron, you're sure to get stuff that you'll actually like because they have

11:37.860 --> 11:41.860
