10360	13360	Airline ticket pricing probably seems like a crapshoot.
13360	18160	The numbers change seemingly arbitrarily every week, day, or hour, but there's some real
18160	20940	science behind these prices.
20940	24840	People spend their whole lives figuring out what to charge you to fly.
24840	30000	Let's take a look at one flight on one route by one airline to understand.
30000	35520	American Flight 33 leaves New York's JFK airport every day at 7am bound for Los Angeles
35520	38640	arriving at 10.51am pacific time.
38640	44120	This transcontinental route is one of the most competitive in the world with over 3.5
44120	49360	million yearly passengers and five major airlines connecting the country's two largest cities.
49360	54120	There's nowhere where pricing strategies are more important for airlines than here.
54120	57800	Looking at three months of fares for this flight, there are eight distinct prices for
57800	62240	economy ranging from $129 to $472.
62240	66820	These all get you on the exact same flight in the exact same seat but each and every
66820	69320	price has a purpose and place.
69320	73840	The lowest price, $129, is the most competitive price.
73840	79360	This fare only shows up three times in our three month span—each time on Tuesdays.
79360	84300	Now, Tuesdays are very often the cheapest days of the week to fly.
84300	87960	Business travelers tend to make up much of the demand during the week and they most often
87960	94040	want to fly out on Monday and return on Thursdays or Fridays so Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays
94040	99000	tend to be the most expensive travel days while Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the
99000	100000	cheapest.
100000	102560	The average ticket price for this flight shows this.
102560	106920	Tuesdays average $182 and Wednesdays $173.
106920	111620	Even if the demand is lower, American Airlines runs this flight anyways and they have to
111620	116940	feel seized to break even so they sell this flight at rock bottom prices.
116940	122660	The next price, $144, actually demonstrates a very interesting phenomenon.
122660	128020	Whenever American prices their flight at $144, they are not alone.
128020	129800	Take March 6th, for example.
129800	134020	American, Delta, Virgin America, JetBlue, and United all have flights from New York
134020	137660	to LA at around 7 in the morning selling for $144.
137660	141140	They're doing what is called price matching.
141140	144380	Because this is one of the most competitive routes in the world and because the number
144380	149420	one determinant for travelers on which airline they take is price, all five airlines flying
149420	152100	this route match each other's prices.
152100	157020	This way, travelers make their decision based off the reputation of each airline rather
157020	158220	than the price.
158220	163300	The price stays at $144 because it's in each airline's best interest to keep it
163300	164300	there.
164300	169260	In a normal market, if Delta, for example, dropped their price to $119 they would get
169260	174080	more travelers since they were the cheapest, but in this price matched market, all the
174080	178780	other airlines would drop their prices as soon as Delta drops theirs so all of them
178780	183180	would get the same amount of travelers as before while earning less money.
183180	187620	But there are some cases where it can make business sense for airlines to drop prices
187620	190300	to below even being profitable.
190300	195460	In the year 2000, WestJet and the now defunct Canjet airlines started flying from central
195460	197420	Canada to Newfoundland.
197420	203440	These routes were historically operated exclusively by Air Canada and they were expensive.
203440	210380	A one-way flight from Montreal in 1999 cost over $600 but when the budget airlines WestJet
210380	216100	and Canjet started flying the route prices dropped dramatically and Air Canada was threatened
216100	219260	so they dropped their prices even lower.
219260	224260	The $600 Air Canada fares then cost $89.
224260	228420	Now it wouldn't make sense for anyone to fly a budget airline over Air Canada at the
228420	234460	same price so WestJet and Canjet were almost driven out of business on these routes until
234460	236700	Canada's competition bureau stepped in.
236700	241700	They concluded that Air Canada was engaging in the uncompetitive action of predatory pricing
241700	245900	since they were pricing flights below what it cost to operate them so they were forced
245900	247080	to stop.
247080	251200	Airlines in the US, with some newly strong budget competitors, are engaging in similar
251200	252880	actions nowadays.
252880	258460	United Airlines, for example, is matching Frontier's $40 fares on many days from Denver
258460	263120	to Chicago, among other routes, in order to maintain their market stronghold in Denver
263120	268580	and Chicago even though their cost to operate the route is drastically higher than Frontier
268580	272100	so they are almost certainly losing money on those fares.
272100	278200	But back to the New York to LA route, $159 is the lowest regular fare for this flight.
278200	284540	The $129 and $144 price points were both basic economy fares—the most restrictive type
284540	289100	with no seat selection, no carry-on bags, and no changes or refunds.
289100	293740	Every flight has a bunch of different booking classes each with a fare code.
293740	301280	For example, the basic economy fare code for the $129 and $144 price is B but the $159 price
301280	306520	books into fare code N. These different booking classes are sometimes known as fare buckets.
306520	310480	Essentially, the airline decides it's going to sell a certain number of tickets at the
310480	314400	$159 price with fare code N—let's say 10.
314400	319820	Then when those 10 tickets are sold the airline then sells economy at fare code G for $204
319820	325520	then when those are sold it sells economy at fare code V for $269 then fare code L for
325520	328820	$318 and so on and so forth.
328820	333220	There are also some cases where a ticket will default to a more expensive fare bucket because
333220	336340	of reasons other than the lower fare selling out.
336340	340820	Many fares, including each mentioned so far, have advance purchase requirements meaning
340820	345980	that, even if a flight is not full at all, the price will increase closer to departure.
345980	351100	All the fares below $204 have an advance purchase requirement of two weeks meaning that you
351100	356620	can only purchase them more than two weeks before departure while the $269 fare, for
356620	360120	example, has an advance purchase requirement of only one week.
360120	364660	Although, the cheapest fare without an advance purchase requirement at all, that is, the
364660	371140	cheapest fare that you could buy day of for this flight is fare class K at $472 which
371140	374940	happens to be the most expensive economy class fare.
374940	377060	And now for some caveats.
377060	382140	Not every fare for this flight is going to be priced at one of these eight prices.
382140	386060	Airlines have mechanisms to adjust fares from these buckets.
386060	390060	In the short term, they can adjust things like the fuel surcharge to raise the price
390060	393160	if other factors, like oil prices, increase.
393160	397540	In the long term, they can adjust the actual prices of the different fare buckets.
397540	401360	Airlines often increase the base fares for busy seasons like summer.
401360	406080	American Airlines does exactly that on this New York to LA route where their fare class
406080	412780	M, for example, increases from $357 to $410 in August.
412940	418300	So far we've looked at this on a micro-level—how prices differ on one flight—but we also
418300	420660	have to consider the macro-level.
420660	427280	Why if you leave on Tuesday, February 6th and fly 2,469 miles to the west to LA do you
427280	435360	pay $129 while if you fly 3,442 miles to the east to London, only a thousand miles further
435360	438500	than LA, you pay $2,772?
438500	445420	Well, the second figure is a bit deceptive because that's the price of a one-way ticket.
445420	449940	If you switch the LA flight to a round-trip ticket returning a week later it will cost
449940	455660	$257—exactly double—while if you turn the London flight into a round-trip returning
455660	461220	a week later the price will drop to $602—almost five times less.
461220	465980	This is understandably confusing—a one-way ticket more expensive than a round-trip—but
465980	469260	the reason this is goes back to the fare codes.
469260	474260	Embedded within each fare code are a bunch of little restrictions that dictate when you
474260	475900	can use that fare.
475900	479620	On the New York to LA trip those restrictions are just things like blackout dates for the
479620	484280	fare and advance purchase requirements, but the New York to London ticket has loads more
484280	489100	restrictions and the ones that make one-ways more expensive than round-trips are the minimum
489100	490800	stay requirements.
490800	496640	These requirements dictate how soon your return flight can be in order to get a particular
496640	497640	fare.
497640	501960	The idea is to price discriminate—business travelers should pay more because they can
501960	502960	pay more.
502960	507180	Meanwhile, airlines try to give the lowest prices to leisure travelers since they're
507180	510720	the ones paying for their own tickets and therefore they're the ones that are the
510720	512820	most price sensitive.
512820	516440	Business travelers often want to be home for the weekend so many of these minimum stay
516440	522200	requirements, like with fares Q, N, and S, just require a Sunday at your destination.
522200	526920	Others, trying to accomplish the same thing, require seven days—a full week—which would
526920	530360	also require a traveler to stay the weekend at their destination.
530360	536160	Now, as the prices go up the requirements go down so once you get to paying around $2,000
536160	540680	you can stay for as few as three days, but the cheapest round-trip base airfare with
540680	549980	no stay requirement at all is $5,544 in fare class Y—exactly double the one-way price.
549980	551540	So that explains this.
551540	556180	The one-way ticket is so expensive because, since the airline doesn't know how long
556180	560600	the traveler will stay at their destination, the one-way fare has to be booked into the
560600	564120	least restrictive fare class without the minimum stay requirement.
564120	568160	You'll see this idea of price discrimination all over ticketing structures.
568640	573240	It's a genius pricing concept that allows different people to buy products at the prices
573240	579320	they can afford and therefore it allows businesses to sell the same product to more people.
579320	583160	Tickets increase in price closer to departure because leisure travelers buy tickets far
583160	587300	out and business travelers buy their tickets close to departure and flexible tickets are
587300	591340	more expensive because that's what business travelers need, but there's another pricing
591340	595240	difference going on that's less fair—between routes.
595240	598120	It's all about competition.
598120	601880	Different routes of the same distance cost different amounts generally not because they
601880	607040	cost different amounts to operate, but because of how much the competitors are charging.
607040	613260	This is part of why flights into small airports are so expensive—because they lack competition.
613260	620560	You can fly the 240 miles from Detroit to Pelston, Michigan on a CRJ200 for $242 or
620560	626840	you can fly the 170 miles from Detroit to South Bend, Indiana on a CRJ200 for $76.
626840	631760	The only difference is that South Bend Airport has flights from United, Delta, and Allegiant
631760	634660	while Pelston only has flights from Delta.
634660	637080	The same phenomenon happens over the Atlantic.
637080	641560	There's more competition on the six hour flight from New York to LA than on the six
641560	647300	hour flight from New York to Dublin so you can fly to LA for $250 round trip while Dublin
647300	649560	costs $500 round trip.
649560	653980	Of course, travelers from New York to LA can drive, take the bus, take the train, or take
653980	660340	a flight connecting halfway there while travelers to Dublin only have one choice—to fly.
660340	665540	In all, the truth is that prices reflect what people will pay and so people will pay what
665540	667620	flights are priced.
667620	671420	If you're a busy person like me you know that eating healthy can be difficult.
671420	675820	Sometimes it seems like you have two choices—quick food or healthy food—but you have another
675820	680260	one—quick and healthy food because that's what Blue Apron is.
