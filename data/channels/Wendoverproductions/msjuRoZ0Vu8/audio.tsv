9040	11140	The Arctic is warming.
11140	16220	That is not an assumption, a belief, a theory, or a political stance—that is an empirical
16220	18880	fact based on empirical data.
18880	23780	Just in 2018, based off the average between 1958 and 2002, the yearly average temperature
23780	27640	in the Arctic should have been this, but in reality, it was this.
27640	35520	One year is not a trend, but here was 2017, here was 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013.
35520	40680	In 2017, overall annual Arctic air temperatures were 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.6 degrees
40680	42440	Celsius above average.
42440	46220	That may not seem like much, but that small difference is like if Paris' climate changed
46220	48040	to that of Istanbul.
48040	51880	Humans have lived in the Arctic for tens of thousands of years, it's far from impossible,
51880	52880	but it is difficult.
52880	57120	We're no strangers to living in difficult places—humans survive on islands days away
57120	61380	from civilization, in deserts nearly completely devoid of natural resources, and in places
61380	65840	like the Arctic where cold and darkness create some of the most rugged conditions on earth.
65840	69280	At least some of us seem to enjoy living in tough conditions.
69280	72520	Where humans are lazy in a sense, though, is economically.
72520	76700	When there's an option to get the same for less, we'll almost always take it.
76700	80660	The Arctic is an enormous area with plenty of natural and human resources, but it's
80660	85920	also a harsh and isolated place meaning there's always been the same options for less—at
85920	87480	least until now.
87480	91220	Traditionally, the Arctic has been far from a center of economic activity.
91220	96700	For example, the Canadian territory of Nunavut has a gross domestic product of just $2 billion.
96700	101360	That means that, despite being the largest province or territory composing 21% of Canada's
101360	106320	land area, Nunavut only makes up 0.13% of the national economy.
106320	108480	The same is true elsewhere, in the Arctic.
108480	114020	Alaska makes up 16% of the US' land but only 0.27% of its economy.
114020	119400	The Finnish region of Lapland makes up 27% of the country's land but only 2.5% of its
119400	120400	economy.
120400	124980	In perhaps the most staggering example, Greenland has a physical size larger than that of Mexico
124980	129140	and yet its economy is smaller than that of the tiny island country of Aruba.
129140	133640	However, it is this very desolation, both physically and economically, that's spurring
133640	135760	new Arctic industries.
135760	137400	Emptiness is an asset.
137400	140780	This space is being filled by those seeking isolation.
140780	145260	Tourism has established itself as the first of two major sectors growing in the Arctic.
145260	149620	For example, Finland's Lapland region has seen double-digit tourism growth over recent
149620	150620	years.
150620	153460	This area has particularly benefited from the attention it receives from Europe's
153460	155500	package holiday industry.
155500	158820	Particularly in the month leading up to Christmas, charter flights by companies like Thomas Cook
158820	163820	and TUI will leave from nearly every UK airport to far north Lapland airports like Kitila,
163820	165600	Rovaniemi, and Ivalo.
165600	168840	Tourists come to visit destinations like Santa Claus Village, an amusement park that bills
168840	173080	itself as the home of Santa, as well as engaging in outdoor activities such as snowmobiling,
173080	174700	dog sledding, and skiing.
174700	178960	With the relative ease of visiting these destinations via direct flights from destinations around
178960	183600	Europe and especially the UK, package tour companies even sell day trips to the Arctic.
183600	187160	One flies out from somewhere like London in the morning, visits Santa Claus Village, and
187160	188880	flies back in the evening.
188880	193220	Of course, this tourism industry, despite its rapid growth, has its shortcomings.
193220	198240	About 44% of all yearly arrivals happen in December and January making it highly seasonal
198240	202440	so the region has put efforts into attracting more spring, summer, and fall visitors.
202440	206680	Lapland has nonetheless decided that tourism is likely its most promising driver of growth
206680	210980	so it has placed this industry at the forefront of its economic development efforts.
210980	215000	The promise of tourism has been identified by other Arctic areas as well.
215000	219360	Visits are increasing steadily in Alaska, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut,
219360	222720	Svalbard—it's tough to find an Arctic region where tourism isn't growing.
222720	226880	While at a much smaller scale than places like Alaska or Lapland, Greenland has made
226880	230040	moderately successful efforts to expand tourism as well.
230040	234640	It has seen healthy growth rates from 181,000 nights stayed by tourists 20 years ago to
234640	236760	263,000 today.
236760	240720	Like many places in the Arctic, though, it suffers from accessibility issues.
240720	243520	It's just hard to get to Greenland.
243520	247280	There are really only two ways to travel there from the outside world—via the three-hour
247280	251560	turboprop flight from Reykjavik or the four-hour jet flight from Copenhagen.
251560	255680	Both options are expensive with the flight from Reykjavik or Copenhagen to Nuuk, Greenland's
255680	259160	total, costing around, at best, $800.
259160	261320	There are no day trips to Greenland.
261320	264880	This is part of the reason why much of the growth in tourism both in Greenland and the
264880	268760	rest of the Arctic uses another means of transport—cruise ships.
268760	272260	In another video we've covered how the warming of the Arctic is melting sea ice and opening
272260	273920	up new maritime routes.
273920	277780	This is making it far easier for large cruise ships to sail through the Arctic waters into
277780	279480	small northern towns.
279480	283360	Now, Arctic cruises have happened for decades to a certain extent but in the past they were
283360	285560	always done by ships like this.
285560	289040	Small expedition-style vessels with strengthened hulls to withstand ice.
289040	293760	In 2016, though, the beast of Arctic cruises, the Northwest Passage route through the Canadian
293760	299560	archipelago from the Pacific to the Atlantic, was completed by this ship—the Crystal Serenity.
299560	303840	Thanks to lower ice levels, it's now possible to sail large, traditional ships through this
303840	304840	route.
304840	308680	The Crystal Serenity is a regular cruise ship built with a regular hull just like every
308680	310040	other cruise ship.
310040	313820	Unlike the smaller ships of before, this one carried 1,000 passengers through the high
313820	319300	Arctic in comfort with onboard restaurants, a spa, theater, casino, and more.
319300	324220	When making voyages like this, ships typically make stops in some of the tiny Alaskan, Canadian,
324220	326580	and Greenlandic towns along the route.
326580	329420	One of the most popular stops is the town of Pond Inlet.
329420	333380	Normally, the only way in here is via the three-hour flight from Iqaluit that costs
333380	338260	well over $1,000 round-trip but a few times a year tourists just wake up a couple hundred
338260	339940	feet off its shore.
339940	344700	Over 1,600 people live in Pond Inlet and yet in 2018, 18 cruise ships stopped in the
344700	346900	town carrying over 3,200 passengers.
346900	352680	That's up from 10 ships in 2015, 9 in 2016, and 13 in 2017.
352680	357720	For a small town of 1,600, especially one like Pond Inlet with a 22% unemployment rate,
357720	361380	the significance of thousands of the kind of tourists willing to pay tens of thousands
361380	363760	for an Arctic cruise visiting is enormous.
363760	367620	The local government runs programs to help develop businesses to cater to cruise guests,
367620	371720	stores stock up on products to sell to visitors, and dozens gain temporary employment to help
371720	373740	coordinate the tourists' shore visits.
373740	377660	Then, on a rapid-fire basis in August and early September—the only time period when
377660	381840	the Northwest Passage is navigable—ships show up just off the coast of Pond Inlet and
381840	385980	dozens of other northern Canadian and Alaskan towns every few days.
385980	392800	The economic benefit of these visits is indisputable—Pond Inlet earned $250,000 in docking fees in 2018
392800	395860	in addition to the benefit local businesses and employees received.
396300	398020	It's not all good news, though.
398020	402080	Due to the enormous price of shipping goods to Arctic towns like Pond Inlet, most of the
402080	406620	indigenous residents hunt whale, seal, caribou, and other indigenous animals to feed their
406620	407620	families.
407620	410880	There's little hard research on its effect yet but many are concerned about these large
410880	414140	ships driving away animals and changing hunting grounds.
414140	417340	This is in addition to the effect climate change itself is already having.
417340	421640	There are also some concerned about poor air quality from ship exhaust, pollution from
421640	425520	ship discharge, for the safety of passengers in an emergency considering the limited search
425520	429600	and rescue capability, and with the preservation of these local cultures.
429600	433360	Just like the nature around them, the isolation of these towns has kept the traditions and
433360	437160	customs of these communities alive in the modern era and one can imagine what it's
437160	441280	like to have 1,000 tourists suddenly show up in a town of 1,600 that's used to having,
441280	444280	at most, a few dozen outsiders there at a time.
444280	448160	The Arctic wants economic development but they don't want these towns to turn into
448160	449680	tourist destinations.
449680	454240	Most want the cruise ships to come but they also want to keep the surroundings unspoiled.
454240	458760	One comes at the cost of the other so it's all just a balancing act of interests.
458760	463080	There are, though, more heavily weighted scales balancing the economy and the environment.
463080	468800	According to estimates, this area, the Arctic, holds 13% of the world's undiscovered oil.
468800	474080	That represents 90 billion barrels which, at current prices, are worth more than $4
474080	475080	trillion.
475080	478960	The thing is, it doesn't really make sense to drill in the Arctic right now.
478960	483480	That's because, in the Arctic, to drill that barrel of oil which, in January 2017,
483480	487080	is selling for $46, it costs about $78.
487080	491520	That's compared to costs as low as $29 per barrel with onshore drilling in the Middle
491520	492520	East.
492520	495720	Whereas in the Middle East all you have to do is build an oil rig, in the Arctic, where
495720	499840	there's limited infrastructure, for offshore drilling, one has to build a rig, get icebreaker
499840	503840	ships, establish a port, set up a transportation and supply network, and more.
503840	508080	In some ways, therefore, Arctic ice melt is helping reduce these costs as it's easier
508080	511900	for ships to move around both to explore for oil and serve rigs.
511900	516420	In other ways, though, this is adding difficulties as less ice leads to larger waves which require
516420	520180	bigger, more expensive boats to navigate which sometimes require dredging in the shallow
520180	522700	waters of some oil-rich locations.
522700	526860	Right now, Arctic oil drilling is sort of in a holding pattern until oil prices increase
526860	530700	or drilling costs decrease enough for it to become economically viable.
530700	534720	As a whole, though, in the long term, Arctic warming decreases costs for the oil and gas
534720	539640	industry as it makes the area look and act more like the cheaper and warmer South.
539640	543280	The economic impact for other industries is more of a mixed bag, though.
543280	547880	For example, fishing represents a large proportion of the current Arctic economy and, while some
547880	552320	species of fish will grow in number due to warmer waters, others will slowly disappear.
552320	555800	In mining, the opening of sea routes will make the transportation cheaper but the industry
555800	559860	actually benefits from having the frozen permafrost land which is disappearing since it gives
559860	563600	a stable platform for equipment and therefore makes setup less expensive.
563600	567800	In fact, land transportation infrastructure in general, including airports, is expected
567800	571920	to deteriorate rapidly as permafrost melts and land becomes less stable.
571920	575800	The tourism industry, which does benefit from easier access and increased activity in the
575800	578520	Arctic, suffers too from Arctic warming.
578520	582720	In November, 2018, Lapland lacked any snow due to unseasonably high temperatures which
582720	586440	led to mass trip cancellations by tourists who booked their trips to see the traditionally
586440	588040	snowy Arctic.
588040	591720	Tourists come for the winter weather so a future without snow in the region is potentially
591720	594360	a future without tourism in Lapland.
594360	599400	In addition, the pristine natural environment is the asset of the Arctic tourism industry
599400	604500	so an Arctic without that pristine natural environment is one without its tourism industry.
604500	608920	Even ignoring the irreversible, disastrous consequences the warming of the Arctic is
608920	613400	already having on polar bears and caribou and fish and walruses and reindeer and all
613400	618860	the other native Arctic species, this circle is home to four million people.
618860	623160	The Arctic, plus a few more degrees, is an Arctic that has fundamentally changed the
623160	627440	way these four million people live and work and that's an Arctic that may no longer
627440	629460	truly be home to them.
629460	633620	The people, animals, and environment of the Arctic, in a metaphorical sense, are situated
633620	637240	between two massive, slow-moving icebergs.
637240	641340	One is the power of climate change and the other is the power of the economy.
641340	646000	Climate change could possibly be slowed or stopped or reversed but only with great effort
646000	648460	by more than just the people of the Arctic.
648460	653340	On the other side, the power of economic pushes and pulls is perhaps just as difficult
653340	654340	to stop.
654340	658340	If it makes economic sense for industries to be in the Arctic, they're almost certainly
658340	662460	going to be in the Arctic even if it means environmental ruin.
662460	666140	These two massive, slow-moving icebergs are on their collision course with the Arctic
666140	669800	already and it might just be too late to stop them.
669800	674820	The physical, economic, and social landscape of the Arctic is going to change.
674820	677160	This might be a story without a happy ending.
677160	681300	The only positive note to end on is that, while riding the sinking ship, there's at
681300	685880	least a chance to make some money on the way down.
685880	689660	If you ever get a chance to visit the Arctic which, as someone who's been there, I highly
689660	693540	recommend if you have the opportunity, the number one thing you should bring is a camera
693540	696920	to capture these stunning landscapes and distinctive towns.
696920	700480	Before heading off, though, you should brush up on your photography skills with Skillshare's
700480	701960	landscape photography class.
701960	706280	Using their iOS or Android apps, you can even download the classes offline for the flight.
706280	710160	Of course, to go to the Arctic you first need the time so, in order to streamline your
710160	714160	work processes and improve your productivity, you should also take their Productivity Masterclass
714160	718040	course by fellow YouTuber and all-around nice guy, Thomas Frank.
718040	722680	In addition to these two, Skillshare has about 22,000 courses so it's the perfect place
722680	725060	to go for those with varied interests.
725060	728720	Best of all, you can take either and all of these courses for free for two months by being
728720	732920	one of the first 500 to go to skl.sh.wendover for.
733080	737120	Also, one last note, I recently got on Instagram to post personal updates and behind-the-scenes
737120	740960	photos of all the travels I do to make these videos so if that sounds interesting to you,
740960	745400	you can go follow it at instagram.com slash sam dot from dot wendover.
745400	749060	Thanks for watching and I'll see you again in two weeks for another Wendover Productions
749060	749560	video.
