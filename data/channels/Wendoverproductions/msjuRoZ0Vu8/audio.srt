3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,140
The Arctic is warming.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,220
That is not an assumption, a belief, a theory, or a political stance—that is an empirical

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,880
fact based on empirical data.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,780
Just in 2018, based off the average between 1958 and 2002, the yearly average temperature

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,640
in the Arctic should have been this, but in reality, it was this.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:35,520
One year is not a trend, but here was 2017, here was 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,680
In 2017, overall annual Arctic air temperatures were 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.6 degrees

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,440
Celsius above average.

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,220
That may not seem like much, but that small difference is like if Paris' climate changed

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,040
to that of Istanbul.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,880
Humans have lived in the Arctic for tens of thousands of years, it's far from impossible,

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
but it is difficult.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,120
We're no strangers to living in difficult places—humans survive on islands days away

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,380
from civilization, in deserts nearly completely devoid of natural resources, and in places

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,840
like the Arctic where cold and darkness create some of the most rugged conditions on earth.

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
At least some of us seem to enjoy living in tough conditions.

19
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,520
Where humans are lazy in a sense, though, is economically.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,700
When there's an option to get the same for less, we'll almost always take it.

21
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,660
The Arctic is an enormous area with plenty of natural and human resources, but it's

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,920
also a harsh and isolated place meaning there's always been the same options for less—at

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,480
least until now.

24
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,220
Traditionally, the Arctic has been far from a center of economic activity.

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,700
For example, the Canadian territory of Nunavut has a gross domestic product of just $2 billion.

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,360
That means that, despite being the largest province or territory composing 21% of Canada's

27
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,320
land area, Nunavut only makes up 0.13% of the national economy.

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,480
The same is true elsewhere, in the Arctic.

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,020
Alaska makes up 16% of the US' land but only 0.27% of its economy.

30
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,400
The Finnish region of Lapland makes up 27% of the country's land but only 2.5% of its

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
economy.

32
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,980
In perhaps the most staggering example, Greenland has a physical size larger than that of Mexico

33
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,140
and yet its economy is smaller than that of the tiny island country of Aruba.

34
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,640
However, it is this very desolation, both physically and economically, that's spurring

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,760
new Arctic industries.

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,400
Emptiness is an asset.

37
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,780
This space is being filled by those seeking isolation.

38
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,260
Tourism has established itself as the first of two major sectors growing in the Arctic.

39
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,620
For example, Finland's Lapland region has seen double-digit tourism growth over recent

40
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
years.

41
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,460
This area has particularly benefited from the attention it receives from Europe's

42
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,500
package holiday industry.

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,820
Particularly in the month leading up to Christmas, charter flights by companies like Thomas Cook

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,820
and TUI will leave from nearly every UK airport to far north Lapland airports like Kitila,

45
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,600
Rovaniemi, and Ivalo.

46
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,840
Tourists come to visit destinations like Santa Claus Village, an amusement park that bills

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,080
itself as the home of Santa, as well as engaging in outdoor activities such as snowmobiling,

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,700
dog sledding, and skiing.

49
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,960
With the relative ease of visiting these destinations via direct flights from destinations around

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,600
Europe and especially the UK, package tour companies even sell day trips to the Arctic.

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,160
One flies out from somewhere like London in the morning, visits Santa Claus Village, and

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,880
flies back in the evening.

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,220
Of course, this tourism industry, despite its rapid growth, has its shortcomings.

54
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,240
About 44% of all yearly arrivals happen in December and January making it highly seasonal

55
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,440
so the region has put efforts into attracting more spring, summer, and fall visitors.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,680
Lapland has nonetheless decided that tourism is likely its most promising driver of growth

57
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,980
so it has placed this industry at the forefront of its economic development efforts.

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:35,000
The promise of tourism has been identified by other Arctic areas as well.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,360
Visits are increasing steadily in Alaska, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut,

60
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,720
Svalbard—it's tough to find an Arctic region where tourism isn't growing.

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,880
While at a much smaller scale than places like Alaska or Lapland, Greenland has made

62
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,040
moderately successful efforts to expand tourism as well.

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,640
It has seen healthy growth rates from 181,000 nights stayed by tourists 20 years ago to

64
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,760
263,000 today.

65
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Like many places in the Arctic, though, it suffers from accessibility issues.

66
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,520
It's just hard to get to Greenland.

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,280
There are really only two ways to travel there from the outside world—via the three-hour

68
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,560
turboprop flight from Reykjavik or the four-hour jet flight from Copenhagen.

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Both options are expensive with the flight from Reykjavik or Copenhagen to Nuuk, Greenland's

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,160
total, costing around, at best, $800.

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,320
There are no day trips to Greenland.

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,880
This is part of the reason why much of the growth in tourism both in Greenland and the

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,760
rest of the Arctic uses another means of transport—cruise ships.

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,260
In another video we've covered how the warming of the Arctic is melting sea ice and opening

75
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,920
up new maritime routes.

76
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,780
This is making it far easier for large cruise ships to sail through the Arctic waters into

77
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,480
small northern towns.

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,360
Now, Arctic cruises have happened for decades to a certain extent but in the past they were

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,560
always done by ships like this.

80
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,040
Small expedition-style vessels with strengthened hulls to withstand ice.

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,760
In 2016, though, the beast of Arctic cruises, the Northwest Passage route through the Canadian

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,560
archipelago from the Pacific to the Atlantic, was completed by this ship—the Crystal Serenity.

83
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,840
Thanks to lower ice levels, it's now possible to sail large, traditional ships through this

84
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,840
route.

85
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,680
The Crystal Serenity is a regular cruise ship built with a regular hull just like every

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,040
other cruise ship.

87
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,820
Unlike the smaller ships of before, this one carried 1,000 passengers through the high

88
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:19,300
Arctic in comfort with onboard restaurants, a spa, theater, casino, and more.

89
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,220
When making voyages like this, ships typically make stops in some of the tiny Alaskan, Canadian,

90
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,580
and Greenlandic towns along the route.

91
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,420
One of the most popular stops is the town of Pond Inlet.

92
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,380
Normally, the only way in here is via the three-hour flight from Iqaluit that costs

93
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,260
well over $1,000 round-trip but a few times a year tourists just wake up a couple hundred

94
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,940
feet off its shore.

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,700
Over 1,600 people live in Pond Inlet and yet in 2018, 18 cruise ships stopped in the

96
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,900
town carrying over 3,200 passengers.

97
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,680
That's up from 10 ships in 2015, 9 in 2016, and 13 in 2017.

98
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,720
For a small town of 1,600, especially one like Pond Inlet with a 22% unemployment rate,

99
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,380
the significance of thousands of the kind of tourists willing to pay tens of thousands

100
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,760
for an Arctic cruise visiting is enormous.

101
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,620
The local government runs programs to help develop businesses to cater to cruise guests,

102
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,720
stores stock up on products to sell to visitors, and dozens gain temporary employment to help

103
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,740
coordinate the tourists' shore visits.

104
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,660
Then, on a rapid-fire basis in August and early September—the only time period when

105
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,840
the Northwest Passage is navigable—ships show up just off the coast of Pond Inlet and

106
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,980
dozens of other northern Canadian and Alaskan towns every few days.

107
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:32,800
The economic benefit of these visits is indisputable—Pond Inlet earned $250,000 in docking fees in 2018

108
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,860
in addition to the benefit local businesses and employees received.

109
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,020
It's not all good news, though.

110
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,080
Due to the enormous price of shipping goods to Arctic towns like Pond Inlet, most of the

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,620
indigenous residents hunt whale, seal, caribou, and other indigenous animals to feed their

112
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
families.

113
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,880
There's little hard research on its effect yet but many are concerned about these large

114
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,140
ships driving away animals and changing hunting grounds.

115
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,340
This is in addition to the effect climate change itself is already having.

116
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:01,640
There are also some concerned about poor air quality from ship exhaust, pollution from

117
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,520
ship discharge, for the safety of passengers in an emergency considering the limited search

118
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,600
and rescue capability, and with the preservation of these local cultures.

119
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,360
Just like the nature around them, the isolation of these towns has kept the traditions and

120
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,160
customs of these communities alive in the modern era and one can imagine what it's

121
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,280
like to have 1,000 tourists suddenly show up in a town of 1,600 that's used to having,

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
at most, a few dozen outsiders there at a time.

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,160
The Arctic wants economic development but they don't want these towns to turn into

124
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,680
tourist destinations.

125
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Most want the cruise ships to come but they also want to keep the surroundings unspoiled.

126
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,760
One comes at the cost of the other so it's all just a balancing act of interests.

127
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,080
There are, though, more heavily weighted scales balancing the economy and the environment.

128
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,800
According to estimates, this area, the Arctic, holds 13% of the world's undiscovered oil.

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,080
That represents 90 billion barrels which, at current prices, are worth more than $4

130
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,080
trillion.

131
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,960
The thing is, it doesn't really make sense to drill in the Arctic right now.

132
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,480
That's because, in the Arctic, to drill that barrel of oil which, in January 2017,

133
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,080
is selling for $46, it costs about $78.

134
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,520
That's compared to costs as low as $29 per barrel with onshore drilling in the Middle

135
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
East.

136
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,720
Whereas in the Middle East all you have to do is build an oil rig, in the Arctic, where

137
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,840
there's limited infrastructure, for offshore drilling, one has to build a rig, get icebreaker

138
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,840
ships, establish a port, set up a transportation and supply network, and more.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,080
In some ways, therefore, Arctic ice melt is helping reduce these costs as it's easier

140
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,900
for ships to move around both to explore for oil and serve rigs.

141
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,420
In other ways, though, this is adding difficulties as less ice leads to larger waves which require

142
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,180
bigger, more expensive boats to navigate which sometimes require dredging in the shallow

143
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,700
waters of some oil-rich locations.

144
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,860
Right now, Arctic oil drilling is sort of in a holding pattern until oil prices increase

145
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,700
or drilling costs decrease enough for it to become economically viable.

146
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,720
As a whole, though, in the long term, Arctic warming decreases costs for the oil and gas

147
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,640
industry as it makes the area look and act more like the cheaper and warmer South.

148
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,280
The economic impact for other industries is more of a mixed bag, though.

149
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,880
For example, fishing represents a large proportion of the current Arctic economy and, while some

150
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,320
species of fish will grow in number due to warmer waters, others will slowly disappear.

151
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,800
In mining, the opening of sea routes will make the transportation cheaper but the industry

152
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,860
actually benefits from having the frozen permafrost land which is disappearing since it gives

153
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,600
a stable platform for equipment and therefore makes setup less expensive.

154
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,800
In fact, land transportation infrastructure in general, including airports, is expected

155
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,920
to deteriorate rapidly as permafrost melts and land becomes less stable.

156
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,800
The tourism industry, which does benefit from easier access and increased activity in the

157
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,520
Arctic, suffers too from Arctic warming.

158
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,720
In November, 2018, Lapland lacked any snow due to unseasonably high temperatures which

159
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,440
led to mass trip cancellations by tourists who booked their trips to see the traditionally

160
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,040
snowy Arctic.

161
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,720
Tourists come for the winter weather so a future without snow in the region is potentially

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,360
a future without tourism in Lapland.

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,400
In addition, the pristine natural environment is the asset of the Arctic tourism industry

164
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,500
so an Arctic without that pristine natural environment is one without its tourism industry.

165
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,920
Even ignoring the irreversible, disastrous consequences the warming of the Arctic is

166
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,400
already having on polar bears and caribou and fish and walruses and reindeer and all

167
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,860
the other native Arctic species, this circle is home to four million people.

168
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,160
The Arctic, plus a few more degrees, is an Arctic that has fundamentally changed the

169
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,440
way these four million people live and work and that's an Arctic that may no longer

170
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,460
truly be home to them.

171
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,620
The people, animals, and environment of the Arctic, in a metaphorical sense, are situated

172
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,240
between two massive, slow-moving icebergs.

173
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,340
One is the power of climate change and the other is the power of the economy.

174
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,000
Climate change could possibly be slowed or stopped or reversed but only with great effort

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,460
by more than just the people of the Arctic.

176
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,340
On the other side, the power of economic pushes and pulls is perhaps just as difficult

177
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
to stop.

178
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,340
If it makes economic sense for industries to be in the Arctic, they're almost certainly

179
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,460
going to be in the Arctic even if it means environmental ruin.

180
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,140
These two massive, slow-moving icebergs are on their collision course with the Arctic

181
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,800
already and it might just be too late to stop them.

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,820
The physical, economic, and social landscape of the Arctic is going to change.

183
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,160
This might be a story without a happy ending.

184
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,300
The only positive note to end on is that, while riding the sinking ship, there's at

185
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,880
least a chance to make some money on the way down.

186
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,660
If you ever get a chance to visit the Arctic which, as someone who's been there, I highly

187
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:33,540
recommend if you have the opportunity, the number one thing you should bring is a camera

188
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,920
to capture these stunning landscapes and distinctive towns.

189
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,480
Before heading off, though, you should brush up on your photography skills with Skillshare's

190
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,960
landscape photography class.

191
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,280
Using their iOS or Android apps, you can even download the classes offline for the flight.

192
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,160
Of course, to go to the Arctic you first need the time so, in order to streamline your

193
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
work processes and improve your productivity, you should also take their Productivity Masterclass

194
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,040
course by fellow YouTuber and all-around nice guy, Thomas Frank.

195
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,680
In addition to these two, Skillshare has about 22,000 courses so it's the perfect place

196
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,060
to go for those with varied interests.

197
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,720
Best of all, you can take either and all of these courses for free for two months by being

198
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,920
one of the first 500 to go to skl.sh.wendover for.

199
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,120
Also, one last note, I recently got on Instagram to post personal updates and behind-the-scenes

200
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,960
photos of all the travels I do to make these videos so if that sounds interesting to you,

201
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,400
you can go follow it at instagram.com slash sam dot from dot wendover.

202
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,060
Thanks for watching and I'll see you again in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

203
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,560
video.
