00:09.040 --> 00:11.140
The Arctic is warming.

00:11.140 --> 00:16.220
That is not an assumption, a belief, a theory, or a political stance—that is an empirical

00:16.220 --> 00:18.880
fact based on empirical data.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.780
Just in 2018, based off the average between 1958 and 2002, the yearly average temperature

00:23.780 --> 00:27.640
in the Arctic should have been this, but in reality, it was this.

00:27.640 --> 00:35.520
One year is not a trend, but here was 2017, here was 2016, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

00:35.520 --> 00:40.680
In 2017, overall annual Arctic air temperatures were 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.6 degrees

00:40.680 --> 00:42.440
Celsius above average.

00:42.440 --> 00:46.220
That may not seem like much, but that small difference is like if Paris' climate changed

00:46.220 --> 00:48.040
to that of Istanbul.

00:48.040 --> 00:51.880
Humans have lived in the Arctic for tens of thousands of years, it's far from impossible,

00:51.880 --> 00:52.880
but it is difficult.

00:52.880 --> 00:57.120
We're no strangers to living in difficult places—humans survive on islands days away

00:57.120 --> 01:01.380
from civilization, in deserts nearly completely devoid of natural resources, and in places

01:01.380 --> 01:05.840
like the Arctic where cold and darkness create some of the most rugged conditions on earth.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.280
At least some of us seem to enjoy living in tough conditions.

01:09.280 --> 01:12.520
Where humans are lazy in a sense, though, is economically.

01:12.520 --> 01:16.700
When there's an option to get the same for less, we'll almost always take it.

01:16.700 --> 01:20.660
The Arctic is an enormous area with plenty of natural and human resources, but it's

01:20.660 --> 01:25.920
also a harsh and isolated place meaning there's always been the same options for less—at

01:25.920 --> 01:27.480
least until now.

01:27.480 --> 01:31.220
Traditionally, the Arctic has been far from a center of economic activity.

01:31.220 --> 01:36.700
For example, the Canadian territory of Nunavut has a gross domestic product of just $2 billion.

01:36.700 --> 01:41.360
That means that, despite being the largest province or territory composing 21% of Canada's

01:41.360 --> 01:46.320
land area, Nunavut only makes up 0.13% of the national economy.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.480
The same is true elsewhere, in the Arctic.

01:48.480 --> 01:54.020
Alaska makes up 16% of the US' land but only 0.27% of its economy.

01:54.020 --> 01:59.400
The Finnish region of Lapland makes up 27% of the country's land but only 2.5% of its

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
economy.

02:00.400 --> 02:04.980
In perhaps the most staggering example, Greenland has a physical size larger than that of Mexico

02:04.980 --> 02:09.140
and yet its economy is smaller than that of the tiny island country of Aruba.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.640
However, it is this very desolation, both physically and economically, that's spurring

02:13.640 --> 02:15.760
new Arctic industries.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.400
Emptiness is an asset.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.780
This space is being filled by those seeking isolation.

02:20.780 --> 02:25.260
Tourism has established itself as the first of two major sectors growing in the Arctic.

02:25.260 --> 02:29.620
For example, Finland's Lapland region has seen double-digit tourism growth over recent

02:29.620 --> 02:30.620
years.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.460
This area has particularly benefited from the attention it receives from Europe's

02:33.460 --> 02:35.500
package holiday industry.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.820
Particularly in the month leading up to Christmas, charter flights by companies like Thomas Cook

02:38.820 --> 02:43.820
and TUI will leave from nearly every UK airport to far north Lapland airports like Kitila,

02:43.820 --> 02:45.600
Rovaniemi, and Ivalo.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.840
Tourists come to visit destinations like Santa Claus Village, an amusement park that bills

02:48.840 --> 02:53.080
itself as the home of Santa, as well as engaging in outdoor activities such as snowmobiling,

02:53.080 --> 02:54.700
dog sledding, and skiing.

02:54.700 --> 02:58.960
With the relative ease of visiting these destinations via direct flights from destinations around

02:58.960 --> 03:03.600
Europe and especially the UK, package tour companies even sell day trips to the Arctic.

03:03.600 --> 03:07.160
One flies out from somewhere like London in the morning, visits Santa Claus Village, and

03:07.160 --> 03:08.880
flies back in the evening.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.220
Of course, this tourism industry, despite its rapid growth, has its shortcomings.

03:13.220 --> 03:18.240
About 44% of all yearly arrivals happen in December and January making it highly seasonal

03:18.240 --> 03:22.440
so the region has put efforts into attracting more spring, summer, and fall visitors.

03:22.440 --> 03:26.680
Lapland has nonetheless decided that tourism is likely its most promising driver of growth

03:26.680 --> 03:30.980
so it has placed this industry at the forefront of its economic development efforts.

03:30.980 --> 03:35.000
The promise of tourism has been identified by other Arctic areas as well.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.360
Visits are increasing steadily in Alaska, the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut,

03:39.360 --> 03:42.720
Svalbard—it's tough to find an Arctic region where tourism isn't growing.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.880
While at a much smaller scale than places like Alaska or Lapland, Greenland has made

03:46.880 --> 03:50.040
moderately successful efforts to expand tourism as well.

03:50.040 --> 03:54.640
It has seen healthy growth rates from 181,000 nights stayed by tourists 20 years ago to

03:54.640 --> 03:56.760
263,000 today.

03:56.760 --> 04:00.720
Like many places in the Arctic, though, it suffers from accessibility issues.

04:00.720 --> 04:03.520
It's just hard to get to Greenland.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.280
There are really only two ways to travel there from the outside world—via the three-hour

04:07.280 --> 04:11.560
turboprop flight from Reykjavik or the four-hour jet flight from Copenhagen.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.680
Both options are expensive with the flight from Reykjavik or Copenhagen to Nuuk, Greenland's

04:15.680 --> 04:19.160
total, costing around, at best, $800.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.320
There are no day trips to Greenland.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.880
This is part of the reason why much of the growth in tourism both in Greenland and the

04:24.880 --> 04:28.760
rest of the Arctic uses another means of transport—cruise ships.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.260
In another video we've covered how the warming of the Arctic is melting sea ice and opening

04:32.260 --> 04:33.920
up new maritime routes.

04:33.920 --> 04:37.780
This is making it far easier for large cruise ships to sail through the Arctic waters into

04:37.780 --> 04:39.480
small northern towns.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.360
Now, Arctic cruises have happened for decades to a certain extent but in the past they were

04:43.360 --> 04:45.560
always done by ships like this.

04:45.560 --> 04:49.040
Small expedition-style vessels with strengthened hulls to withstand ice.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.760
In 2016, though, the beast of Arctic cruises, the Northwest Passage route through the Canadian

04:53.760 --> 04:59.560
archipelago from the Pacific to the Atlantic, was completed by this ship—the Crystal Serenity.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.840
Thanks to lower ice levels, it's now possible to sail large, traditional ships through this

05:03.840 --> 05:04.840
route.

05:04.840 --> 05:08.680
The Crystal Serenity is a regular cruise ship built with a regular hull just like every

05:08.680 --> 05:10.040
other cruise ship.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.820
Unlike the smaller ships of before, this one carried 1,000 passengers through the high

05:13.820 --> 05:19.300
Arctic in comfort with onboard restaurants, a spa, theater, casino, and more.

05:19.300 --> 05:24.220
When making voyages like this, ships typically make stops in some of the tiny Alaskan, Canadian,

05:24.220 --> 05:26.580
and Greenlandic towns along the route.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.420
One of the most popular stops is the town of Pond Inlet.

05:29.420 --> 05:33.380
Normally, the only way in here is via the three-hour flight from Iqaluit that costs

05:33.380 --> 05:38.260
well over $1,000 round-trip but a few times a year tourists just wake up a couple hundred

05:38.260 --> 05:39.940
feet off its shore.

05:39.940 --> 05:44.700
Over 1,600 people live in Pond Inlet and yet in 2018, 18 cruise ships stopped in the

05:44.700 --> 05:46.900
town carrying over 3,200 passengers.

05:46.900 --> 05:52.680
That's up from 10 ships in 2015, 9 in 2016, and 13 in 2017.

05:52.680 --> 05:57.720
For a small town of 1,600, especially one like Pond Inlet with a 22% unemployment rate,

05:57.720 --> 06:01.380
the significance of thousands of the kind of tourists willing to pay tens of thousands

06:01.380 --> 06:03.760
for an Arctic cruise visiting is enormous.

06:03.760 --> 06:07.620
The local government runs programs to help develop businesses to cater to cruise guests,

06:07.620 --> 06:11.720
stores stock up on products to sell to visitors, and dozens gain temporary employment to help

06:11.720 --> 06:13.740
coordinate the tourists' shore visits.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.660
Then, on a rapid-fire basis in August and early September—the only time period when

06:17.660 --> 06:21.840
the Northwest Passage is navigable—ships show up just off the coast of Pond Inlet and

06:21.840 --> 06:25.980
dozens of other northern Canadian and Alaskan towns every few days.

06:25.980 --> 06:32.800
The economic benefit of these visits is indisputable—Pond Inlet earned $250,000 in docking fees in 2018

06:32.800 --> 06:35.860
in addition to the benefit local businesses and employees received.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.020
It's not all good news, though.

06:38.020 --> 06:42.080
Due to the enormous price of shipping goods to Arctic towns like Pond Inlet, most of the

06:42.080 --> 06:46.620
indigenous residents hunt whale, seal, caribou, and other indigenous animals to feed their

06:46.620 --> 06:47.620
families.

06:47.620 --> 06:50.880
There's little hard research on its effect yet but many are concerned about these large

06:50.880 --> 06:54.140
ships driving away animals and changing hunting grounds.

06:54.140 --> 06:57.340
This is in addition to the effect climate change itself is already having.

06:57.340 --> 07:01.640
There are also some concerned about poor air quality from ship exhaust, pollution from

07:01.640 --> 07:05.520
ship discharge, for the safety of passengers in an emergency considering the limited search

07:05.520 --> 07:09.600
and rescue capability, and with the preservation of these local cultures.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.360
Just like the nature around them, the isolation of these towns has kept the traditions and

07:13.360 --> 07:17.160
customs of these communities alive in the modern era and one can imagine what it's

07:17.160 --> 07:21.280
like to have 1,000 tourists suddenly show up in a town of 1,600 that's used to having,

07:21.280 --> 07:24.280
at most, a few dozen outsiders there at a time.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.160
The Arctic wants economic development but they don't want these towns to turn into

07:28.160 --> 07:29.680
tourist destinations.

07:29.680 --> 07:34.240
Most want the cruise ships to come but they also want to keep the surroundings unspoiled.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.760
One comes at the cost of the other so it's all just a balancing act of interests.

07:38.760 --> 07:43.080
There are, though, more heavily weighted scales balancing the economy and the environment.

07:43.080 --> 07:48.800
According to estimates, this area, the Arctic, holds 13% of the world's undiscovered oil.

07:48.800 --> 07:54.080
That represents 90 billion barrels which, at current prices, are worth more than $4

07:54.080 --> 07:55.080
trillion.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.960
The thing is, it doesn't really make sense to drill in the Arctic right now.

07:58.960 --> 08:03.480
That's because, in the Arctic, to drill that barrel of oil which, in January 2017,

08:03.480 --> 08:07.080
is selling for $46, it costs about $78.

08:07.080 --> 08:11.520
That's compared to costs as low as $29 per barrel with onshore drilling in the Middle

08:11.520 --> 08:12.520
East.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.720
Whereas in the Middle East all you have to do is build an oil rig, in the Arctic, where

08:15.720 --> 08:19.840
there's limited infrastructure, for offshore drilling, one has to build a rig, get icebreaker

08:19.840 --> 08:23.840
ships, establish a port, set up a transportation and supply network, and more.

08:23.840 --> 08:28.080
In some ways, therefore, Arctic ice melt is helping reduce these costs as it's easier

08:28.080 --> 08:31.900
for ships to move around both to explore for oil and serve rigs.

08:31.900 --> 08:36.420
In other ways, though, this is adding difficulties as less ice leads to larger waves which require

08:36.420 --> 08:40.180
bigger, more expensive boats to navigate which sometimes require dredging in the shallow

08:40.180 --> 08:42.700
waters of some oil-rich locations.

08:42.700 --> 08:46.860
Right now, Arctic oil drilling is sort of in a holding pattern until oil prices increase

08:46.860 --> 08:50.700
or drilling costs decrease enough for it to become economically viable.

08:50.700 --> 08:54.720
As a whole, though, in the long term, Arctic warming decreases costs for the oil and gas

08:54.720 --> 08:59.640
industry as it makes the area look and act more like the cheaper and warmer South.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.280
The economic impact for other industries is more of a mixed bag, though.

09:03.280 --> 09:07.880
For example, fishing represents a large proportion of the current Arctic economy and, while some

09:07.880 --> 09:12.320
species of fish will grow in number due to warmer waters, others will slowly disappear.

09:12.320 --> 09:15.800
In mining, the opening of sea routes will make the transportation cheaper but the industry

09:15.800 --> 09:19.860
actually benefits from having the frozen permafrost land which is disappearing since it gives

09:19.860 --> 09:23.600
a stable platform for equipment and therefore makes setup less expensive.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.800
In fact, land transportation infrastructure in general, including airports, is expected

09:27.800 --> 09:31.920
to deteriorate rapidly as permafrost melts and land becomes less stable.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.800
The tourism industry, which does benefit from easier access and increased activity in the

09:35.800 --> 09:38.520
Arctic, suffers too from Arctic warming.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.720
In November, 2018, Lapland lacked any snow due to unseasonably high temperatures which

09:42.720 --> 09:46.440
led to mass trip cancellations by tourists who booked their trips to see the traditionally

09:46.440 --> 09:48.040
snowy Arctic.

09:48.040 --> 09:51.720
Tourists come for the winter weather so a future without snow in the region is potentially

09:51.720 --> 09:54.360
a future without tourism in Lapland.

09:54.360 --> 09:59.400
In addition, the pristine natural environment is the asset of the Arctic tourism industry

09:59.400 --> 10:04.500
so an Arctic without that pristine natural environment is one without its tourism industry.

10:04.500 --> 10:08.920
Even ignoring the irreversible, disastrous consequences the warming of the Arctic is

10:08.920 --> 10:13.400
already having on polar bears and caribou and fish and walruses and reindeer and all

10:13.400 --> 10:18.860
the other native Arctic species, this circle is home to four million people.

10:18.860 --> 10:23.160
The Arctic, plus a few more degrees, is an Arctic that has fundamentally changed the

10:23.160 --> 10:27.440
way these four million people live and work and that's an Arctic that may no longer

10:27.440 --> 10:29.460
truly be home to them.

10:29.460 --> 10:33.620
The people, animals, and environment of the Arctic, in a metaphorical sense, are situated

10:33.620 --> 10:37.240
between two massive, slow-moving icebergs.

10:37.240 --> 10:41.340
One is the power of climate change and the other is the power of the economy.

10:41.340 --> 10:46.000
Climate change could possibly be slowed or stopped or reversed but only with great effort

10:46.000 --> 10:48.460
by more than just the people of the Arctic.

10:48.460 --> 10:53.340
On the other side, the power of economic pushes and pulls is perhaps just as difficult

10:53.340 --> 10:54.340
to stop.

10:54.340 --> 10:58.340
If it makes economic sense for industries to be in the Arctic, they're almost certainly

10:58.340 --> 11:02.460
going to be in the Arctic even if it means environmental ruin.

11:02.460 --> 11:06.140
These two massive, slow-moving icebergs are on their collision course with the Arctic

11:06.140 --> 11:09.800
already and it might just be too late to stop them.

11:09.800 --> 11:14.820
The physical, economic, and social landscape of the Arctic is going to change.

11:14.820 --> 11:17.160
This might be a story without a happy ending.

11:17.160 --> 11:21.300
The only positive note to end on is that, while riding the sinking ship, there's at

11:21.300 --> 11:25.880
least a chance to make some money on the way down.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.660
If you ever get a chance to visit the Arctic which, as someone who's been there, I highly

11:29.660 --> 11:33.540
recommend if you have the opportunity, the number one thing you should bring is a camera

11:33.540 --> 11:36.920
to capture these stunning landscapes and distinctive towns.

11:36.920 --> 11:40.480
Before heading off, though, you should brush up on your photography skills with Skillshare's

11:40.480 --> 11:41.960
landscape photography class.

11:41.960 --> 11:46.280
Using their iOS or Android apps, you can even download the classes offline for the flight.

11:46.280 --> 11:50.160
Of course, to go to the Arctic you first need the time so, in order to streamline your

11:50.160 --> 11:54.160
work processes and improve your productivity, you should also take their Productivity Masterclass

11:54.160 --> 11:58.040
course by fellow YouTuber and all-around nice guy, Thomas Frank.

11:58.040 --> 12:02.680
In addition to these two, Skillshare has about 22,000 courses so it's the perfect place

12:02.680 --> 12:05.060
to go for those with varied interests.

12:05.060 --> 12:08.720
Best of all, you can take either and all of these courses for free for two months by being

12:08.720 --> 12:12.920
one of the first 500 to go to skl.sh.wendover for.

12:13.080 --> 12:17.120
Also, one last note, I recently got on Instagram to post personal updates and behind-the-scenes

12:17.120 --> 12:20.960
photos of all the travels I do to make these videos so if that sounds interesting to you,

12:20.960 --> 12:25.400
you can go follow it at instagram.com slash sam dot from dot wendover.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.060
Thanks for watching and I'll see you again in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

12:29.060 --> 12:29.560
video.
