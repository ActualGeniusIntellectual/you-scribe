0	5540	This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Squarespace.
5540	9240	Make your next move with a beautiful website from Squarespace.
9240	13780	This video is a bit of a continuation of my last one—why planes don't fly faster.
13780	18420	I ended up talking a lot about the Concorde, the supersonic plane, but part of the story
18420	20260	was left untold.
20260	24420	Even though the Concorde failed, even though it wasn't commercially viable, it still
24420	27980	had a profound effect on how we fly today.
27980	29460	Let me explain.
29460	32060	Economy class is not how airlines make money.
32060	36180	The real money, at least for the traditional airlines, is in premium cabins.
36180	39880	Let's take, for example, this British Airways 777.
39880	44740	There are 224 total seats on this plane and it flies daily between London Heathrow and
44740	46500	Washington Dulles Airport.
46500	51540	A round-trip economy class ticket leaving March 15th and returning on March 22nd costs,
51540	55060	at the time of writing, $876.
55060	61300	That means that, if each one of the 122 economy class seats is filled, the entire back section
61300	66180	of the plane will make the airline, round-trip, $106,872.
66180	74320	Meanwhile, the going rate for one of their premium economy seats is $2,633 round-trip
74320	79500	meaning the entire cabin will make $105,320.
79500	83940	Already you can see that the entire 40 seat premium economy section makes British Airways
83940	87360	roughly as much as the entire economy class section.
87360	98020	Going up to business class, there are 48 seats sold each for $6,723 making the airline $322,704.
98020	106100	The 14 first class seats are sold for $8,715 each or $122,010 total.
106100	112080	So once again, the 14 passengers at the front of the plane make the airline more money than
112080	115200	the $122 at the back of the plane.
115200	120640	In total, the three premium cabins—premium economy, business, and first—make the airline
120640	124880	on this flight $550,034.
124880	130760	That means that 45% of the passengers account for 84% of the airline's revenue.
130760	133080	Now, I need to add some caveats.
133080	138520	There is no airline on earth that makes half a million dollars for a six-hour flight over
138520	139520	the Atlantic.
139520	141880	If they did they would be swimming in money.
141880	146360	The fares for this particular routing are significantly higher than the average fare
146360	151680	paid for that flight because they're non-stop fares between two high-income, high-demand
151680	152680	cities.
152680	156440	Of course, a majority of passengers on that flight will not be traveling between London
156440	158920	and Washington—they'll have connected.
158920	164460	If you originate the ticket in, say, Stockholm, and connect onto that 777 flight to Washington,
164460	172140	the economy class price drops to $392, the premium economy to $1,150, the business class
172140	178220	to $3,025, and the first class to $5,564.
178220	182460	But the proportions are still roughly the same—a vast majority of the revenue comes
182460	184900	from a minority of passengers.
184900	189420	This particular British Airways 777 is also a very premium-heavy configuration because
189420	195340	British Airways is an airline that focuses a lot on premium travel, but still, on average,
195340	200720	two-thirds of any airline's revenue comes from passengers in first, business, or premium
200720	203940	economy class, but this wasn't always the case.
203940	208660	In the beginning of commercial aviation there weren't really any classes because everything
208660	209660	was premium.
209660	214020	That's not to say that planes were very luxurious—a 1920's plane looked like this—but
214020	218220	flying was just so expensive that the experience of flying was the luxury itself.
218220	222620	It's kind of like how you don't see Virgin Galactic selling first, business, and economy
222620	225660	class seats on their planned tourist flights to space.
225660	228140	The experience itself is the luxury.
228140	232520	Once commercial space travel becomes commonplace, we'll almost certainly see a classification
232520	236780	of the experience, but until a transport method is at a cost where it's attainable to the
236780	239680	normal person, it's all first class.
239680	246100	In 1950, a round-trip coach fare between New York and London was $675.
246100	252060	And for inflation, that's $6,800 today—roughly the same price as a first class ticket on
252060	253540	the same route nowadays.
253540	258100	It's the exact same type of passenger flying in both these seats.
258100	261320	What's changed is who's flying further back in the plane.
261320	265740	So the story of the development of airline classes really isn't the story of how airlines
265740	271300	developed more and more luxurious seats, it's how they cut costs to allow more and more
271300	272500	people to fly.
272500	276060	It's also a fascinating demonstration of economics.
276060	280500	Airlines have figured out a way to sell the same product for different prices to different
280500	281500	people.
281500	285020	The overall product the airline is selling is the same no matter which class you're
285020	289240	flying—a flight from point A to point B. What's different is the experience within
289240	290240	the plane.
290240	293980	The first classification of air travel happened in the 40s and 50s.
293980	298320	A significant amount of revenue for airlines at the time came from contracts for air mail
298320	300600	routes with the US Postal Service.
300600	304060	These flights flew with many stops often overnight or at odd hours.
304060	308140	While the planes mostly carried mail, they still had a passenger section.
308140	312500	The first class fares got you, for example, on a non-stop flight between New York and
312500	317080	Chicago while the coach fare might get you on a mail flight that left at 2 AM and stopped
317080	319660	in Pittsburgh and Cleveland on the way to Chicago.
319660	323740	While the fare was cheaper and the flight took longer, the experience onboard the plane
323740	325160	was largely the same.
325160	330780	It wasn't until 1952 that airlines started selling the same flights for different prices.
330780	335060	One airline, for example, sold standard class one-way tickets between New York and London
335060	339660	for $395 and tourist class tickets for $270.
339660	345540	It was the exact same flight on the exact same plane—the difference was in the ticket.
345540	349540	Tourist class tickets had to be purchased in advance and had no flexibility.
349540	352900	You had to fly on the exact flight the tickets were purchased for.
352900	356940	As the name suggests, these tickets were primarily for tourists.
356940	362020	Travelers plan trips far in advance and don't really need flexibility so it was no problem
362020	364420	for them to commit to one flight.
364420	368900	The full fare tickets were for the other type of traveler—the businessperson.
368900	372540	Business travelers, first off, don't typically pay for their own tickets.
372540	376960	They're paid for by their employer so they individually don't really care what the
376960	378220	ticket costs.
378220	382700	Business travelers also require flexibility and generally don't purchase tickets until
382700	383860	the last minute.
383860	388040	At the time, it was a common practice to just walk up to the counter an hour before a flight
388040	389180	and buy a ticket.
389180	392080	That's what these full fare tickets were for.
392080	396720	Through this system, the airlines segmented the market into two categories based on what
396720	398440	people were willing to pay.
398440	403380	Over the coming decades, this was the only large classification system in air travel.
403380	408920	Then, between 1969 and 1978, three things happened.
408920	414040	The 747 flew for the first time, the Concorde flew for the first time, and airlines were
414040	416120	deregulated in the US.
416120	421800	The 747 gave airlines the space to experiment with luxury, the Concorde gave them the reason
421800	425400	to, and deregulation gave them the ability to.
425400	429820	Previously, all airlines were heavily regulated in the US and it was difficult for airlines
429820	434560	to charge the costs they wanted for different classes, but with deregulation, airlines now
434560	437240	had full control over their ticket prices.
437240	441000	Now, at the time, much of the difference was still in the ticket.
441000	445120	Some airlines had introduced first class fares with nicer seats, but airlines realized that
445120	449680	they had to start treating the business people who bought a full fare coach ticket differently
449680	452200	than the tourists paying a discounted fare.
452200	456020	More and more of the business travelers were just paying the tourist class fare.
456020	459080	It began by just physically separating the passengers.
459080	462720	The full fare passengers would be seated up front while the discounted fare passengers
462720	464320	would be put at the back.
464320	469240	In 2017, some airlines began blocking out the middle seat next to the full fare passengers.
469240	474280	Finally, some airlines started to build cabins with slightly nicer seats and better amenities.
474280	478400	But, with exceptions, airlines avoided first class.
478400	482920	Most focused on capturing that middle tier of traveler because the Concorde was going
482920	486160	to be the first class plane for the rich and famous.
486160	488900	Regular planes would be the business and economy class.
488900	490640	At least that's what they thought.
490640	496420	Of course, as you heard about in my last video, the Concorde failed, spectacularly.
496420	500440	Airlines avoided first class in the 70's and 80's because of the Concorde, but as
500440	505120	they started to catch onto the failure of supersonic flight, select airlines slowly
505120	508240	reintroduced first class to subsonic planes.
508240	510400	But the effect is still seen today.
510400	515720	Of the dozens of airlines flying transatlantic, only six have a first class cabin.
515720	520320	Back in the 60's and 70's, the imminent perceived competition of the Concorde really
520320	525640	invigorated airlines to optimize that middle class—business class—but we likely would
525640	530240	not have seen it as early as we did without the looming disruption to the industry.
530240	532400	But there's another trend to explain.
532400	534280	First class is going away—again.
534280	538180	Let's take a look at this seat map of Etihad A380.
538180	543320	Each economy class seat on this plane takes up 3.77 square feet of floor space.
543320	548180	The business class seats take up 10.14 square feet of floor space and the first class seats
548180	550860	take up 35 square feet of floor space.
550860	557360	On a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York, economy class tickets are $1,253 round trip, business
557360	564440	class tickets are $6,140, and first class tickets are $14,128.
564440	571100	That means that economy class seats make $332 per square foot, business class seats $605
571100	575800	per square foot, and first class seats $403 per square foot.
575800	580640	The difference between economy class and business class is huge—it's a cramped seat versus
580640	585220	a bed—but the difference between business class and first class is just a bit more room
585220	586460	and some better food.
586460	591080	It's very hard for airlines to sell first class for much more than business class since
591080	596280	the experience is largely the same, but the cost for airlines to run a first class cabin
596280	598340	is significantly more.
598340	602220	Therefore, more and more airlines are taking out their first class to just put in more
602220	604320	business class—it just makes more money.
604320	609320	If an airline could fill a plane full of business class passengers it would—it's been tried,
609320	615080	but pretty much no route has the premium demand to fill a plane full of business class.
615080	619700	Everyone in economy, in the end, is just there to fill the plane.
619700	622480	This video was made possible by Squarespace.
622480	625480	Squarespace is the absolute easiest way to make your website.
625660	629560	I've used them for a few different sites including wendoverproductions.com.
629560	633500	As I said last time, I basically bought that domain to be sure nobody else could.
633500	637620	I didn't really have the time or need to create a fancy website so I just spent about
637620	640440	15 minutes to throw together a landing page.
640440	644660	It was incredibly easy with the Squarespace templates and, in my opinion at least, it
644660	645660	looks great.
645660	649920	Now I can give people one link that takes them to a page with the links to all my different
649920	651680	social media profiles.
651680	656660	You can create a landing page like this, a blog, a store, really anything with Squarespace
656660	661540	and what's best is that you can get 10% off your first order by using the code wendover
