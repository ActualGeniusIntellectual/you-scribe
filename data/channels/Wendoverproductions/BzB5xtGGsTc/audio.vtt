This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Squarespace.

00:05.540 --> 00:09.240
Make your next move with a beautiful website from Squarespace.

00:09.240 --> 00:13.780
This video is a bit of a continuation of my last one—why planes don't fly faster.

00:13.780 --> 00:18.420
I ended up talking a lot about the Concorde, the supersonic plane, but part of the story

00:18.420 --> 00:20.260
was left untold.

00:20.260 --> 00:24.420
Even though the Concorde failed, even though it wasn't commercially viable, it still

00:24.420 --> 00:27.980
had a profound effect on how we fly today.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.460
Let me explain.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.060
Economy class is not how airlines make money.

00:32.060 --> 00:36.180
The real money, at least for the traditional airlines, is in premium cabins.

00:36.180 --> 00:39.880
Let's take, for example, this British Airways 777.

00:39.880 --> 00:44.740
There are 224 total seats on this plane and it flies daily between London Heathrow and

00:44.740 --> 00:46.500
Washington Dulles Airport.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.540
A round-trip economy class ticket leaving March 15th and returning on March 22nd costs,

00:51.540 --> 00:55.060
at the time of writing, $876.

00:55.060 --> 01:01.300
That means that, if each one of the 122 economy class seats is filled, the entire back section

01:01.300 --> 01:06.180
of the plane will make the airline, round-trip, $106,872.

01:06.180 --> 01:14.320
Meanwhile, the going rate for one of their premium economy seats is $2,633 round-trip

01:14.320 --> 01:19.500
meaning the entire cabin will make $105,320.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.940
Already you can see that the entire 40 seat premium economy section makes British Airways

01:23.940 --> 01:27.360
roughly as much as the entire economy class section.

01:27.360 --> 01:38.020
Going up to business class, there are 48 seats sold each for $6,723 making the airline $322,704.

01:38.020 --> 01:46.100
The 14 first class seats are sold for $8,715 each or $122,010 total.

01:46.100 --> 01:52.080
So once again, the 14 passengers at the front of the plane make the airline more money than

01:52.080 --> 01:55.200
the $122 at the back of the plane.

01:55.200 --> 02:00.640
In total, the three premium cabins—premium economy, business, and first—make the airline

02:00.640 --> 02:04.880
on this flight $550,034.

02:04.880 --> 02:10.760
That means that 45% of the passengers account for 84% of the airline's revenue.

02:10.760 --> 02:13.080
Now, I need to add some caveats.

02:13.080 --> 02:18.520
There is no airline on earth that makes half a million dollars for a six-hour flight over

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
the Atlantic.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.880
If they did they would be swimming in money.

02:21.880 --> 02:26.360
The fares for this particular routing are significantly higher than the average fare

02:26.360 --> 02:31.680
paid for that flight because they're non-stop fares between two high-income, high-demand

02:31.680 --> 02:32.680
cities.

02:32.680 --> 02:36.440
Of course, a majority of passengers on that flight will not be traveling between London

02:36.440 --> 02:38.920
and Washington—they'll have connected.

02:38.920 --> 02:44.460
If you originate the ticket in, say, Stockholm, and connect onto that 777 flight to Washington,

02:44.460 --> 02:52.140
the economy class price drops to $392, the premium economy to $1,150, the business class

02:52.140 --> 02:58.220
to $3,025, and the first class to $5,564.

02:58.220 --> 03:02.460
But the proportions are still roughly the same—a vast majority of the revenue comes

03:02.460 --> 03:04.900
from a minority of passengers.

03:04.900 --> 03:09.420
This particular British Airways 777 is also a very premium-heavy configuration because

03:09.420 --> 03:15.340
British Airways is an airline that focuses a lot on premium travel, but still, on average,

03:15.340 --> 03:20.720
two-thirds of any airline's revenue comes from passengers in first, business, or premium

03:20.720 --> 03:23.940
economy class, but this wasn't always the case.

03:23.940 --> 03:28.660
In the beginning of commercial aviation there weren't really any classes because everything

03:28.660 --> 03:29.660
was premium.

03:29.660 --> 03:34.020
That's not to say that planes were very luxurious—a 1920's plane looked like this—but

03:34.020 --> 03:38.220
flying was just so expensive that the experience of flying was the luxury itself.

03:38.220 --> 03:42.620
It's kind of like how you don't see Virgin Galactic selling first, business, and economy

03:42.620 --> 03:45.660
class seats on their planned tourist flights to space.

03:45.660 --> 03:48.140
The experience itself is the luxury.

03:48.140 --> 03:52.520
Once commercial space travel becomes commonplace, we'll almost certainly see a classification

03:52.520 --> 03:56.780
of the experience, but until a transport method is at a cost where it's attainable to the

03:56.780 --> 03:59.680
normal person, it's all first class.

03:59.680 --> 04:06.100
In 1950, a round-trip coach fare between New York and London was $675.

04:06.100 --> 04:12.060
And for inflation, that's $6,800 today—roughly the same price as a first class ticket on

04:12.060 --> 04:13.540
the same route nowadays.

04:13.540 --> 04:18.100
It's the exact same type of passenger flying in both these seats.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.320
What's changed is who's flying further back in the plane.

04:21.320 --> 04:25.740
So the story of the development of airline classes really isn't the story of how airlines

04:25.740 --> 04:31.300
developed more and more luxurious seats, it's how they cut costs to allow more and more

04:31.300 --> 04:32.500
people to fly.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.060
It's also a fascinating demonstration of economics.

04:36.060 --> 04:40.500
Airlines have figured out a way to sell the same product for different prices to different

04:40.500 --> 04:41.500
people.

04:41.500 --> 04:45.020
The overall product the airline is selling is the same no matter which class you're

04:45.020 --> 04:49.240
flying—a flight from point A to point B. What's different is the experience within

04:49.240 --> 04:50.240
the plane.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.980
The first classification of air travel happened in the 40s and 50s.

04:53.980 --> 04:58.320
A significant amount of revenue for airlines at the time came from contracts for air mail

04:58.320 --> 05:00.600
routes with the US Postal Service.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.060
These flights flew with many stops often overnight or at odd hours.

05:04.060 --> 05:08.140
While the planes mostly carried mail, they still had a passenger section.

05:08.140 --> 05:12.500
The first class fares got you, for example, on a non-stop flight between New York and

05:12.500 --> 05:17.080
Chicago while the coach fare might get you on a mail flight that left at 2 AM and stopped

05:17.080 --> 05:19.660
in Pittsburgh and Cleveland on the way to Chicago.

05:19.660 --> 05:23.740
While the fare was cheaper and the flight took longer, the experience onboard the plane

05:23.740 --> 05:25.160
was largely the same.

05:25.160 --> 05:30.780
It wasn't until 1952 that airlines started selling the same flights for different prices.

05:30.780 --> 05:35.060
One airline, for example, sold standard class one-way tickets between New York and London

05:35.060 --> 05:39.660
for $395 and tourist class tickets for $270.

05:39.660 --> 05:45.540
It was the exact same flight on the exact same plane—the difference was in the ticket.

05:45.540 --> 05:49.540
Tourist class tickets had to be purchased in advance and had no flexibility.

05:49.540 --> 05:52.900
You had to fly on the exact flight the tickets were purchased for.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.940
As the name suggests, these tickets were primarily for tourists.

05:56.940 --> 06:02.020
Travelers plan trips far in advance and don't really need flexibility so it was no problem

06:02.020 --> 06:04.420
for them to commit to one flight.

06:04.420 --> 06:08.900
The full fare tickets were for the other type of traveler—the businessperson.

06:08.900 --> 06:12.540
Business travelers, first off, don't typically pay for their own tickets.

06:12.540 --> 06:16.960
They're paid for by their employer so they individually don't really care what the

06:16.960 --> 06:18.220
ticket costs.

06:18.220 --> 06:22.700
Business travelers also require flexibility and generally don't purchase tickets until

06:22.700 --> 06:23.860
the last minute.

06:23.860 --> 06:28.040
At the time, it was a common practice to just walk up to the counter an hour before a flight

06:28.040 --> 06:29.180
and buy a ticket.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.080
That's what these full fare tickets were for.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.720
Through this system, the airlines segmented the market into two categories based on what

06:36.720 --> 06:38.440
people were willing to pay.

06:38.440 --> 06:43.380
Over the coming decades, this was the only large classification system in air travel.

06:43.380 --> 06:48.920
Then, between 1969 and 1978, three things happened.

06:48.920 --> 06:54.040
The 747 flew for the first time, the Concorde flew for the first time, and airlines were

06:54.040 --> 06:56.120
deregulated in the US.

06:56.120 --> 07:01.800
The 747 gave airlines the space to experiment with luxury, the Concorde gave them the reason

07:01.800 --> 07:05.400
to, and deregulation gave them the ability to.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.820
Previously, all airlines were heavily regulated in the US and it was difficult for airlines

07:09.820 --> 07:14.560
to charge the costs they wanted for different classes, but with deregulation, airlines now

07:14.560 --> 07:17.240
had full control over their ticket prices.

07:17.240 --> 07:21.000
Now, at the time, much of the difference was still in the ticket.

07:21.000 --> 07:25.120
Some airlines had introduced first class fares with nicer seats, but airlines realized that

07:25.120 --> 07:29.680
they had to start treating the business people who bought a full fare coach ticket differently

07:29.680 --> 07:32.200
than the tourists paying a discounted fare.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.020
More and more of the business travelers were just paying the tourist class fare.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.080
It began by just physically separating the passengers.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.720
The full fare passengers would be seated up front while the discounted fare passengers

07:42.720 --> 07:44.320
would be put at the back.

07:44.320 --> 07:49.240
In 2017, some airlines began blocking out the middle seat next to the full fare passengers.

07:49.240 --> 07:54.280
Finally, some airlines started to build cabins with slightly nicer seats and better amenities.

07:54.280 --> 07:58.400
But, with exceptions, airlines avoided first class.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.920
Most focused on capturing that middle tier of traveler because the Concorde was going

08:02.920 --> 08:06.160
to be the first class plane for the rich and famous.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.900
Regular planes would be the business and economy class.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.640
At least that's what they thought.

08:10.640 --> 08:16.420
Of course, as you heard about in my last video, the Concorde failed, spectacularly.

08:16.420 --> 08:20.440
Airlines avoided first class in the 70's and 80's because of the Concorde, but as

08:20.440 --> 08:25.120
they started to catch onto the failure of supersonic flight, select airlines slowly

08:25.120 --> 08:28.240
reintroduced first class to subsonic planes.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.400
But the effect is still seen today.

08:30.400 --> 08:35.720
Of the dozens of airlines flying transatlantic, only six have a first class cabin.

08:35.720 --> 08:40.320
Back in the 60's and 70's, the imminent perceived competition of the Concorde really

08:40.320 --> 08:45.640
invigorated airlines to optimize that middle class—business class—but we likely would

08:45.640 --> 08:50.240
not have seen it as early as we did without the looming disruption to the industry.

08:50.240 --> 08:52.400
But there's another trend to explain.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.280
First class is going away—again.

08:54.280 --> 08:58.180
Let's take a look at this seat map of Etihad A380.

08:58.180 --> 09:03.320
Each economy class seat on this plane takes up 3.77 square feet of floor space.

09:03.320 --> 09:08.180
The business class seats take up 10.14 square feet of floor space and the first class seats

09:08.180 --> 09:10.860
take up 35 square feet of floor space.

09:10.860 --> 09:17.360
On a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York, economy class tickets are $1,253 round trip, business

09:17.360 --> 09:24.440
class tickets are $6,140, and first class tickets are $14,128.

09:24.440 --> 09:31.100
That means that economy class seats make $332 per square foot, business class seats $605

09:31.100 --> 09:35.800
per square foot, and first class seats $403 per square foot.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.640
The difference between economy class and business class is huge—it's a cramped seat versus

09:40.640 --> 09:45.220
a bed—but the difference between business class and first class is just a bit more room

09:45.220 --> 09:46.460
and some better food.

09:46.460 --> 09:51.080
It's very hard for airlines to sell first class for much more than business class since

09:51.080 --> 09:56.280
the experience is largely the same, but the cost for airlines to run a first class cabin

09:56.280 --> 09:58.340
is significantly more.

09:58.340 --> 10:02.220
Therefore, more and more airlines are taking out their first class to just put in more

10:02.220 --> 10:04.320
business class—it just makes more money.

10:04.320 --> 10:09.320
If an airline could fill a plane full of business class passengers it would—it's been tried,

10:09.320 --> 10:15.080
but pretty much no route has the premium demand to fill a plane full of business class.

10:15.080 --> 10:19.700
Everyone in economy, in the end, is just there to fill the plane.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.480
This video was made possible by Squarespace.

10:22.480 --> 10:25.480
Squarespace is the absolute easiest way to make your website.

10:25.660 --> 10:29.560
I've used them for a few different sites including wendoverproductions.com.

10:29.560 --> 10:33.500
As I said last time, I basically bought that domain to be sure nobody else could.

10:33.500 --> 10:37.620
I didn't really have the time or need to create a fancy website so I just spent about

10:37.620 --> 10:40.440
15 minutes to throw together a landing page.

10:40.440 --> 10:44.660
It was incredibly easy with the Squarespace templates and, in my opinion at least, it

10:44.660 --> 10:45.660
looks great.

10:45.660 --> 10:49.920
Now I can give people one link that takes them to a page with the links to all my different

10:49.920 --> 10:51.680
social media profiles.

10:51.680 --> 10:56.660
You can create a landing page like this, a blog, a store, really anything with Squarespace

10:56.660 --> 11:01.540
and what's best is that you can get 10% off your first order by using the code wendover
