3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,780
This video is a bit of a continuation of my last one—why planes don't fly faster.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,420
I ended up talking a lot about the Concorde, the supersonic plane, but part of the story

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,260
was left untold.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,420
Even though the Concorde failed, even though it wasn't commercially viable, it still

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,980
had a profound effect on how we fly today.

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,460
Let me explain.

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,060
Economy class is not how airlines make money.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,180
The real money, at least for the traditional airlines, is in premium cabins.

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,880
Let's take, for example, this British Airways 777.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,740
There are 224 total seats on this plane and it flies daily between London Heathrow and

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,500
Washington Dulles Airport.

14
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,540
A round-trip economy class ticket leaving March 15th and returning on March 22nd costs,

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,060
at the time of writing, $876.

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:01,300
That means that, if each one of the 122 economy class seats is filled, the entire back section

17
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,180
of the plane will make the airline, round-trip, $106,872.

18
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:14,320
Meanwhile, the going rate for one of their premium economy seats is $2,633 round-trip

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,500
meaning the entire cabin will make $105,320.

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,940
Already you can see that the entire 40 seat premium economy section makes British Airways

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,360
roughly as much as the entire economy class section.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:38,020
Going up to business class, there are 48 seats sold each for $6,723 making the airline $322,704.

23
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:46,100
The 14 first class seats are sold for $8,715 each or $122,010 total.

24
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:52,080
So once again, the 14 passengers at the front of the plane make the airline more money than

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,200
the $122 at the back of the plane.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,640
In total, the three premium cabins—premium economy, business, and first—make the airline

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,880
on this flight $550,034.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,760
That means that 45% of the passengers account for 84% of the airline's revenue.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,080
Now, I need to add some caveats.

30
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,520
There is no airline on earth that makes half a million dollars for a six-hour flight over

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
the Atlantic.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,880
If they did they would be swimming in money.

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:26,360
The fares for this particular routing are significantly higher than the average fare

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,680
paid for that flight because they're non-stop fares between two high-income, high-demand

35
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
cities.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,440
Of course, a majority of passengers on that flight will not be traveling between London

37
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,920
and Washington—they'll have connected.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,460
If you originate the ticket in, say, Stockholm, and connect onto that 777 flight to Washington,

39
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,140
the economy class price drops to $392, the premium economy to $1,150, the business class

40
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,220
to $3,025, and the first class to $5,564.

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,460
But the proportions are still roughly the same—a vast majority of the revenue comes

42
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,900
from a minority of passengers.

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,420
This particular British Airways 777 is also a very premium-heavy configuration because

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,340
British Airways is an airline that focuses a lot on premium travel, but still, on average,

45
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:20,720
two-thirds of any airline's revenue comes from passengers in first, business, or premium

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,940
economy class, but this wasn't always the case.

47
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,660
In the beginning of commercial aviation there weren't really any classes because everything

48
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
was premium.

49
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,020
That's not to say that planes were very luxurious—a 1920's plane looked like this—but

50
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,220
flying was just so expensive that the experience of flying was the luxury itself.

51
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,620
It's kind of like how you don't see Virgin Galactic selling first, business, and economy

52
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,660
class seats on their planned tourist flights to space.

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,140
The experience itself is the luxury.

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,520
Once commercial space travel becomes commonplace, we'll almost certainly see a classification

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,780
of the experience, but until a transport method is at a cost where it's attainable to the

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,680
normal person, it's all first class.

57
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,100
In 1950, a round-trip coach fare between New York and London was $675.

58
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:12,060
And for inflation, that's $6,800 today—roughly the same price as a first class ticket on

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,540
the same route nowadays.

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,100
It's the exact same type of passenger flying in both these seats.

61
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,320
What's changed is who's flying further back in the plane.

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,740
So the story of the development of airline classes really isn't the story of how airlines

63
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,300
developed more and more luxurious seats, it's how they cut costs to allow more and more

64
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,500
people to fly.

65
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,060
It's also a fascinating demonstration of economics.

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,500
Airlines have figured out a way to sell the same product for different prices to different

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
people.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,020
The overall product the airline is selling is the same no matter which class you're

69
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,240
flying—a flight from point A to point B. What's different is the experience within

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
the plane.

71
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,980
The first classification of air travel happened in the 40s and 50s.

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,320
A significant amount of revenue for airlines at the time came from contracts for air mail

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,600
routes with the US Postal Service.

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,060
These flights flew with many stops often overnight or at odd hours.

75
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,140
While the planes mostly carried mail, they still had a passenger section.

76
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,500
The first class fares got you, for example, on a non-stop flight between New York and

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,080
Chicago while the coach fare might get you on a mail flight that left at 2 AM and stopped

78
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,660
in Pittsburgh and Cleveland on the way to Chicago.

79
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,740
While the fare was cheaper and the flight took longer, the experience onboard the plane

80
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,160
was largely the same.

81
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,780
It wasn't until 1952 that airlines started selling the same flights for different prices.

82
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,060
One airline, for example, sold standard class one-way tickets between New York and London

83
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,660
for $395 and tourist class tickets for $270.

84
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,540
It was the exact same flight on the exact same plane—the difference was in the ticket.

85
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Tourist class tickets had to be purchased in advance and had no flexibility.

86
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,900
You had to fly on the exact flight the tickets were purchased for.

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,940
As the name suggests, these tickets were primarily for tourists.

88
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,020
Travelers plan trips far in advance and don't really need flexibility so it was no problem

89
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,420
for them to commit to one flight.

90
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:08,900
The full fare tickets were for the other type of traveler—the businessperson.

91
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,540
Business travelers, first off, don't typically pay for their own tickets.

92
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,960
They're paid for by their employer so they individually don't really care what the

93
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,220
ticket costs.

94
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,700
Business travelers also require flexibility and generally don't purchase tickets until

95
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,860
the last minute.

96
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,040
At the time, it was a common practice to just walk up to the counter an hour before a flight

97
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,180
and buy a ticket.

98
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,080
That's what these full fare tickets were for.

99
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,720
Through this system, the airlines segmented the market into two categories based on what

100
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,440
people were willing to pay.

101
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,380
Over the coming decades, this was the only large classification system in air travel.

102
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,920
Then, between 1969 and 1978, three things happened.

103
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,040
The 747 flew for the first time, the Concorde flew for the first time, and airlines were

104
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,120
deregulated in the US.

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,800
The 747 gave airlines the space to experiment with luxury, the Concorde gave them the reason

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,400
to, and deregulation gave them the ability to.

107
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,820
Previously, all airlines were heavily regulated in the US and it was difficult for airlines

108
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,560
to charge the costs they wanted for different classes, but with deregulation, airlines now

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,240
had full control over their ticket prices.

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, at the time, much of the difference was still in the ticket.

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,120
Some airlines had introduced first class fares with nicer seats, but airlines realized that

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,680
they had to start treating the business people who bought a full fare coach ticket differently

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,200
than the tourists paying a discounted fare.

114
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,020
More and more of the business travelers were just paying the tourist class fare.

115
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,080
It began by just physically separating the passengers.

116
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,720
The full fare passengers would be seated up front while the discounted fare passengers

117
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,320
would be put at the back.

118
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,240
In 2017, some airlines began blocking out the middle seat next to the full fare passengers.

119
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,280
Finally, some airlines started to build cabins with slightly nicer seats and better amenities.

120
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,400
But, with exceptions, airlines avoided first class.

121
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,920
Most focused on capturing that middle tier of traveler because the Concorde was going

122
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:06,160
to be the first class plane for the rich and famous.

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,900
Regular planes would be the business and economy class.

124
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,640
At least that's what they thought.

125
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,420
Of course, as you heard about in my last video, the Concorde failed, spectacularly.

126
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,440
Airlines avoided first class in the 70's and 80's because of the Concorde, but as

127
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,120
they started to catch onto the failure of supersonic flight, select airlines slowly

128
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
reintroduced first class to subsonic planes.

129
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
But the effect is still seen today.

130
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,720
Of the dozens of airlines flying transatlantic, only six have a first class cabin.

131
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,320
Back in the 60's and 70's, the imminent perceived competition of the Concorde really

132
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,640
invigorated airlines to optimize that middle class—business class—but we likely would

133
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,240
not have seen it as early as we did without the looming disruption to the industry.

134
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,400
But there's another trend to explain.

135
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,280
First class is going away—again.

136
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,180
Let's take a look at this seat map of Etihad A380.

137
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:03,320
Each economy class seat on this plane takes up 3.77 square feet of floor space.

138
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,180
The business class seats take up 10.14 square feet of floor space and the first class seats

139
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,860
take up 35 square feet of floor space.

140
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:17,360
On a flight from Abu Dhabi to New York, economy class tickets are $1,253 round trip, business

141
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,440
class tickets are $6,140, and first class tickets are $14,128.

142
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,100
That means that economy class seats make $332 per square foot, business class seats $605

143
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,800
per square foot, and first class seats $403 per square foot.

144
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,640
The difference between economy class and business class is huge—it's a cramped seat versus

145
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,220
a bed—but the difference between business class and first class is just a bit more room

146
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,460
and some better food.

147
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,080
It's very hard for airlines to sell first class for much more than business class since

148
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,280
the experience is largely the same, but the cost for airlines to run a first class cabin

149
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,340
is significantly more.

150
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,220
Therefore, more and more airlines are taking out their first class to just put in more

151
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
business class—it just makes more money.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,320
If an airline could fill a plane full of business class passengers it would—it's been tried,

153
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,080
but pretty much no route has the premium demand to fill a plane full of business class.

154
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,700
Everyone in economy, in the end, is just there to fill the plane.

155
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,480
This video was made possible by Squarespace.

156
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Squarespace is the absolute easiest way to make your website.

157
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,560
I've used them for a few different sites including wendoverproductions.com.

158
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,500
As I said last time, I basically bought that domain to be sure nobody else could.

159
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,620
I didn't really have the time or need to create a fancy website so I just spent about

160
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,440
15 minutes to throw together a landing page.

161
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,660
It was incredibly easy with the Squarespace templates and, in my opinion at least, it

162
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,660
looks great.

163
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,920
Now I can give people one link that takes them to a page with the links to all my different

164
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,680
social media profiles.

165
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,660
You can create a landing page like this, a blog, a store, really anything with Squarespace

166
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,540
and what's best is that you can get 10% off your first order by using the code wendover

167
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,620
over at squarespace.com slash wendover.

168
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,920
That also helps you help the channel so please do go check out Squarespace at squarespace.com

169
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,700
slash wendover.

170
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,620
Other than that, you can support Wendover Productions at patreon.com slash wendoverproductions,

171
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,720

172
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,760
