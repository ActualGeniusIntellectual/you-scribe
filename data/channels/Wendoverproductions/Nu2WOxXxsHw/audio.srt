3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,720
The post office made America.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,000
It's an ambitious claim, I know, but without it, the United States as we know it today

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,860
would not exist.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,540
As author Winifred Gallagher eloquently pointed out in her book How the Post Office Created

7
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,620
America, in the years following the American Revolution, one didn't say, the United States

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,940
is, they said, the United States are.

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,540
The country at the time was just a loose collectivity of states.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,300
The national government was weak.

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,960
People identified with their state first and their country second.

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,540
With the opening of the post office, however, Americans across the continent had, for the

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:49,160
first time, a direct link to the federal government and the outside world.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,340
In the New England colonies that preceded the United States, infrastructure was poor.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,460
It was considered a great achievement when travelers could finally reach New York from

16
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,980
Boston in under a week.

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,700
There was little emphasis on creating roads between colonies since each was a unique,

18
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,220
independent entity.

19
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,180
Some have even attributed the colonists' lack of attachment to the crown to their lack

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,400
of roads.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,940
Those living outside of cities might have never met a royal official in their lives

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,780
just because of how hard it was to get around.

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,820
Given this, the crown's postal system in the colonies was slow, expensive, and emphasized

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,820
links across the Atlantic to Britain almost more than it did links between the colonies.

25
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,100
Before the American Revolution, there were unofficial, almost black market ways of getting

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,860
mail around, but the increasingly legitimate Continental Congress—the group that eventually

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,060
declared American independence—realized that in order to properly coordinate and collaborate,

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,700
the member colonists needed a way to effectively communicate.

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,140
Therefore, surprisingly, the United States post office was founded almost a full year

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,980
before the United States itself.

31
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,880
In the century following its founding, the US had a bit of a good problem—it expanded

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,480
in territory faster than it could expand in people.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,700
For much of its history and still to an extent today, the United States was a country of

34
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,140
vast, untamed wilderness.

35
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,340
This was especially true in the early years to the west of the Appalachians.

36
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,780
Despite the gold rush, California only hit a population of 1 million in about 1890.

37
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,340
By that time, the nation had a population of over 60 million and between California

38
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:28,740
and the Appalachians during the early 1800s, there was hardly anything—especially roads.

39
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,540
California might as well have been an island.

40
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,900
To get there, most people and mail would take a steamship down to Panama, cross the country

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,920
on land, and then re-board a ship to California rather than attempting to cross the continent

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,240
by land.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,060
People were naturally afraid to settle the frontier.

44
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,500
The idea of being physically and informationally detached from the civilized world while surrounded

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:56,140
by untamed and dangerous wilderness made it difficult for the new nation to push west.

46
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,740
You have to remember that until the telegraph became widespread in the 1850s and 60s, mail

47
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,180
was quite literally the only way to communicate long distance.

48
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,760
If you had a post office, you were connected.

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,780
If you didn't, you were alone.

50
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,580
Therefore, one of the first steps for a new town to legitimize itself was to appeal to

51
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,860
the federal government for a post office and this was usually granted.

52
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,220
Having a physical vestige of the federal government in towns across the continent was immensely

53
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,420
beneficial.

54
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,020
Many would even say it played a large role in America's success.

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,140
You see the US today as a fiercely nationalistic country, but as mentioned, for a while, state

56
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,660
came before country.

57
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,580
However, these new brick and mortar representations of the power and benefit of the federal government

58
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,820
helped tie the nation together, but the post office's impact didn't stop at its mere

59
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,460
existence.

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,820
Newspapers shipped free, or at least close to free, and that revolutionized the spread

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
of information.

62
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,620
In the 1850s, this meant that someone in brand new Houston, Texas could read a newspaper

63
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,980
just as easily as someone in Washington DC.

64
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,300
If it had been more difficult to distribute national newspapers, individuals wouldn't

65
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
have had information on national politics.

66
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,180
Without knowledge of national politics, the state might have stayed as the dominant entity.

67
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,660
The long overland routes to tiny frontier towns absolutely did not make money, but the

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,720
post office wasn't supposed to make money at the time.

69
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,780
It was there to make living in a frontier town of 1,000 as similar as possible to living

70
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,540
in an east coast town of 100,000.

71
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,380
150 years ago, it took more than a month and a half to travel to many parts of the frontier

72
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,020
from New York—if you could get to them at all.

73
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,500
However, the post offices needed faster routes so it created post roads—long rudimentary

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,820
overland routes.

75
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,180
With time and traffic, however, these post roads developed into America's first interstate

76
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
roads.

77
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,020
The informational links led to physical links.

78
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,360
A big question, however, was how to efficiently get the mail out into and across the frontier.

79
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,020
In 1860, the railroad ended in western Missouri and after that the mail had to go out overland.

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,340
The Pony Express was a short-lived commercial express mail service connecting the end of

81
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,040
the railroad to California.

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,000
In only ten days, it could get a letter from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,140
This was unbelievable at the time.

84
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,340
Once mail arrived at the end of the railroad line in St. Joseph's, Missouri, a writer

85
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:33,540
would take the pouch of mail and immediately start riding west at up to 25 miles per hour—full

86
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,140
speed—and then every ten or so miles they'd stop at a Pony Express station to switch to

87
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,380
a fresh horse.

88
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,780
Every 75 miles, they'd switch riders to keep the mail pouch thundering across the

89
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,940
country day and night.

90
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,060
This didn't come cheap.

91
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:53,060
It was the equivalent of $130 to send just one half ounce letter, but time is money and

92
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
people did pay.

93
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:59,540
One of the most famous rides of the short-lived Pony Express was following the 1860 election.

94
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,540
Telegraph did exist at the time but it didn't stretch all the way across the country.

95
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,300
The eastern line ended in Fort Kearney, Nebraska so following the news of Lincoln's win,

96
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,140
a writer set out west.

97
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,380
Using the relay system, writers made their way across the country to Fort Churchill,

98
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,140
Nevada—the beginning of the western telegraph line—to transmit the news.

99
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,780
The west coast papers therefore published the news of Lincoln's win only seven days

100
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,820
and seventeen hours behind the east coast papers.

101
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,720
Just two years earlier, it took seventeen days for news to cross the continent.

102
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,380
This was an unbelievable feat.

103
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,580
With the completion of the transcontinental telegraph line in 1861, however, the Pony

104
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:44,420
Express closed its doors after only 19 months of operation, but it did play a big role in

105
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,280
the innovation of mail systems.

106
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,020
As mail volume rose to the west coast, the US post office looked for ways to further

107
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,860
shorten the travel time across the continent.

108
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,860
Until the opening of the transcontinental railroad in 1863, most transcontinental mail

109
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,980
went out to Missouri by rail before switching to lower cost stagecoach rather than the Pony

110
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,180
Express.

111
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,820
At first all westward mail was put on the train to be sorted in Missouri, but in 1862,

112
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,460
the first post office on wheels was put into operation.

113
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,640
A staffer would sort the mail while on the move in an identical way as a post office

114
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,480
on land so when it arrived in St. Joseph's, Missouri it was all split up in different

115
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,840
bundles for different destinations.

116
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,760
This system proved incredibly successful and in the coming decades, the post office gave

117
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,120
exorbitant subsidies and payments to railroads across the country to move mail.

118
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,820
Most lines to small communities would never have been financially viable without the post

119
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,820
office contracts they attracted.

120
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:48,160
The post office, therefore, was instrumental in physically connecting small towns across

121
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,900
America to the outside world.

122
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,600
Expansion was getting easy.

123
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,080
This role in innovation happened once again in the 1920s.

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,820
Aviation became big during World War I, but once peace was settled it almost became irrelevant.

125
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,000
Civil aviation was at first nearly non-existent.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,620
Just months after the end of World War I, however, the first regularly scheduled airmail

127
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,220
route between DC and New York began.

128
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:19,500
By 1925, airmail routes stretched to hundreds of towns all across the United States.

129
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,960
Just like with the railroad, the post's subsidies allowed for air service to towns

130
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,920
that would never have been profitable with passenger only flights.

131
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,360
The US airmail service grew to become the largest in the world making the US one of

132
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,540
the most connected countries in the world and its legacy still survives today.

133
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,240
Many of the airlines that merged into United, Delta, and American Airlines were founded

134
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,680
as airmail operators.

135
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,880
It's easy to forget that 200 years ago, only 8 million people lived in the 20 states

136
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,560
and 4 territories that formed the union.

137
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,160
The continent filled in incredibly fast and a lot of the credit has to be given to the

138
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,560
postal system.

139
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,920
Few countries as large as the US have such a strong national identity.

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,480
The spread of information is one of the greatest determinants of a country's success and

141
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,720
it's unlikely the US would be such a global superpower today without the education, connectivity,

142
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,180
and innovation that the post office brought.

143
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,420
Of the five largest countries in the world, the US is the only to not have a serious present

144
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,820
day sovereignty movement within its borders.

145
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,340
This has to be at least partially attributed to how easy it has always been to spread information

146
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
across the country.

147
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,660
It may be obsolete today, but the post office was once the peak of innovation—so much

148
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:42,740
so that it made America.

149
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,120
This video was made possible by Away.

150
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,040
This past weekend I traveled Transatlantic with my new Away suitcase and I can now honestly

151
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,280
say it's the perfect suitcase.

152
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,320
It's just wonderfully designed.

153
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,120
It looks great and has a built-in TSA approved lock on the top.

154
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,640
Inside, you put bulky stuff on the left held in by the mesh and clothes on the right to

155
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
be compressed by straps.

156
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,660
It has a spot for a laptop and even a waterproof laundry bag to fill up as you go.

157
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,140
By far the best feature, though, has to be the built-in battery to charge your phone,

158
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,700
tablet, or anything else powered by USB.

159
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,420
It can charge your iPhone up to five times so that you know that you'll always have

160
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,980
a charge when you're on the go.

161
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,200
You can get your Away suitcase with $20 off and free shipping within the contiguous United

162
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,140
States by going to awaytravel.com slash wendover and using the code wendover at checkout.

163
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,280
