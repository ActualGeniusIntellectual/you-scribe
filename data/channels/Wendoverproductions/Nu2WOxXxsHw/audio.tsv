9560	11720	The post office made America.
11720	17000	It's an ambitious claim, I know, but without it, the United States as we know it today
17000	18860	would not exist.
18860	23540	As author Winifred Gallagher eloquently pointed out in her book How the Post Office Created
23540	27620	America, in the years following the American Revolution, one didn't say, the United States
27620	30940	is, they said, the United States are.
30940	34540	The country at the time was just a loose collectivity of states.
34540	36300	The national government was weak.
36300	39960	People identified with their state first and their country second.
39960	44540	With the opening of the post office, however, Americans across the continent had, for the
44540	49160	first time, a direct link to the federal government and the outside world.
49160	53340	In the New England colonies that preceded the United States, infrastructure was poor.
53340	57460	It was considered a great achievement when travelers could finally reach New York from
57460	58980	Boston in under a week.
58980	63700	There was little emphasis on creating roads between colonies since each was a unique,
63700	65220	independent entity.
65220	69180	Some have even attributed the colonists' lack of attachment to the crown to their lack
69180	70400	of roads.
70400	74940	Those living outside of cities might have never met a royal official in their lives
74940	77780	just because of how hard it was to get around.
77780	82820	Given this, the crown's postal system in the colonies was slow, expensive, and emphasized
82820	87820	links across the Atlantic to Britain almost more than it did links between the colonies.
87820	92100	Before the American Revolution, there were unofficial, almost black market ways of getting
92100	96860	mail around, but the increasingly legitimate Continental Congress—the group that eventually
96860	102060	declared American independence—realized that in order to properly coordinate and collaborate,
102060	105700	the member colonists needed a way to effectively communicate.
105700	111140	Therefore, surprisingly, the United States post office was founded almost a full year
111140	113980	before the United States itself.
113980	118880	In the century following its founding, the US had a bit of a good problem—it expanded
118880	122480	in territory faster than it could expand in people.
122480	126700	For much of its history and still to an extent today, the United States was a country of
126700	129140	vast, untamed wilderness.
129140	133340	This was especially true in the early years to the west of the Appalachians.
133340	138780	Despite the gold rush, California only hit a population of 1 million in about 1890.
138780	143340	By that time, the nation had a population of over 60 million and between California
143340	148740	and the Appalachians during the early 1800s, there was hardly anything—especially roads.
148740	151540	California might as well have been an island.
151540	155900	To get there, most people and mail would take a steamship down to Panama, cross the country
155900	160920	on land, and then re-board a ship to California rather than attempting to cross the continent
160920	162240	by land.
162240	165060	People were naturally afraid to settle the frontier.
165060	170500	The idea of being physically and informationally detached from the civilized world while surrounded
170500	176140	by untamed and dangerous wilderness made it difficult for the new nation to push west.
176140	181740	You have to remember that until the telegraph became widespread in the 1850s and 60s, mail
181740	186180	was quite literally the only way to communicate long distance.
186180	188760	If you had a post office, you were connected.
188760	190780	If you didn't, you were alone.
190780	195580	Therefore, one of the first steps for a new town to legitimize itself was to appeal to
195580	199860	the federal government for a post office and this was usually granted.
199860	205220	Having a physical vestige of the federal government in towns across the continent was immensely
205220	206420	beneficial.
206420	211020	Many would even say it played a large role in America's success.
211020	217140	You see the US today as a fiercely nationalistic country, but as mentioned, for a while, state
217140	218660	came before country.
218660	224580	However, these new brick and mortar representations of the power and benefit of the federal government
224580	229820	helped tie the nation together, but the post office's impact didn't stop at its mere
229820	231460	existence.
231460	236820	Newspapers shipped free, or at least close to free, and that revolutionized the spread
236820	237820	of information.
237820	243620	In the 1850s, this meant that someone in brand new Houston, Texas could read a newspaper
243620	246980	just as easily as someone in Washington DC.
246980	251300	If it had been more difficult to distribute national newspapers, individuals wouldn't
251300	254100	have had information on national politics.
254100	259180	Without knowledge of national politics, the state might have stayed as the dominant entity.
259180	263660	The long overland routes to tiny frontier towns absolutely did not make money, but the
263660	266720	post office wasn't supposed to make money at the time.
266720	271780	It was there to make living in a frontier town of 1,000 as similar as possible to living
271780	274540	in an east coast town of 100,000.
274900	280380	150 years ago, it took more than a month and a half to travel to many parts of the frontier
280380	283020	from New York—if you could get to them at all.
283020	288500	However, the post offices needed faster routes so it created post roads—long rudimentary
288500	289820	overland routes.
289820	295180	With time and traffic, however, these post roads developed into America's first interstate
295180	296180	roads.
296180	299020	The informational links led to physical links.
299020	305360	A big question, however, was how to efficiently get the mail out into and across the frontier.
305360	312020	In 1860, the railroad ended in western Missouri and after that the mail had to go out overland.
312020	316340	The Pony Express was a short-lived commercial express mail service connecting the end of
316340	318040	the railroad to California.
318040	322000	In only ten days, it could get a letter from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
322000	324140	This was unbelievable at the time.
324140	328340	Once mail arrived at the end of the railroad line in St. Joseph's, Missouri, a writer
328340	333540	would take the pouch of mail and immediately start riding west at up to 25 miles per hour—full
333540	338140	speed—and then every ten or so miles they'd stop at a Pony Express station to switch to
338140	339380	a fresh horse.
339380	343780	Every 75 miles, they'd switch riders to keep the mail pouch thundering across the
343780	345940	country day and night.
345940	347060	This didn't come cheap.
347060	353060	It was the equivalent of $130 to send just one half ounce letter, but time is money and
353060	354060	people did pay.
354260	359540	One of the most famous rides of the short-lived Pony Express was following the 1860 election.
359540	363540	Telegraph did exist at the time but it didn't stretch all the way across the country.
363540	368300	The eastern line ended in Fort Kearney, Nebraska so following the news of Lincoln's win,
368300	370140	a writer set out west.
370140	374380	Using the relay system, writers made their way across the country to Fort Churchill,
374380	378140	Nevada—the beginning of the western telegraph line—to transmit the news.
378140	382780	The west coast papers therefore published the news of Lincoln's win only seven days
382780	385820	and seventeen hours behind the east coast papers.
385820	390720	Just two years earlier, it took seventeen days for news to cross the continent.
390720	393380	This was an unbelievable feat.
393380	398580	With the completion of the transcontinental telegraph line in 1861, however, the Pony
398580	404420	Express closed its doors after only 19 months of operation, but it did play a big role in
404420	406280	the innovation of mail systems.
406280	411020	As mail volume rose to the west coast, the US post office looked for ways to further
411020	413860	shorten the travel time across the continent.
413860	418860	Until the opening of the transcontinental railroad in 1863, most transcontinental mail
418860	423980	went out to Missouri by rail before switching to lower cost stagecoach rather than the Pony
423980	425180	Express.
425180	430820	At first all westward mail was put on the train to be sorted in Missouri, but in 1862,
430820	434460	the first post office on wheels was put into operation.
434460	438640	A staffer would sort the mail while on the move in an identical way as a post office
438640	443480	on land so when it arrived in St. Joseph's, Missouri it was all split up in different
443480	445840	bundles for different destinations.
445840	450760	This system proved incredibly successful and in the coming decades, the post office gave
450760	456120	exorbitant subsidies and payments to railroads across the country to move mail.
456120	460820	Most lines to small communities would never have been financially viable without the post
460820	462820	office contracts they attracted.
462820	468160	The post office, therefore, was instrumental in physically connecting small towns across
468160	470900	America to the outside world.
470900	472600	Expansion was getting easy.
472600	477080	This role in innovation happened once again in the 1920s.
477080	482820	Aviation became big during World War I, but once peace was settled it almost became irrelevant.
482820	486000	Civil aviation was at first nearly non-existent.
486000	490620	Just months after the end of World War I, however, the first regularly scheduled airmail
490620	493220	route between DC and New York began.
493220	499500	By 1925, airmail routes stretched to hundreds of towns all across the United States.
499500	503960	Just like with the railroad, the post's subsidies allowed for air service to towns
503960	507920	that would never have been profitable with passenger only flights.
507920	512360	The US airmail service grew to become the largest in the world making the US one of
512360	517540	the most connected countries in the world and its legacy still survives today.
517540	522240	Many of the airlines that merged into United, Delta, and American Airlines were founded
522240	523680	as airmail operators.
523680	529880	It's easy to forget that 200 years ago, only 8 million people lived in the 20 states
529880	532560	and 4 territories that formed the union.
532560	537160	The continent filled in incredibly fast and a lot of the credit has to be given to the
537160	538560	postal system.
538560	542920	Few countries as large as the US have such a strong national identity.
542920	547480	The spread of information is one of the greatest determinants of a country's success and
547480	553720	it's unlikely the US would be such a global superpower today without the education, connectivity,
553720	556180	and innovation that the post office brought.
556180	561420	Of the five largest countries in the world, the US is the only to not have a serious present
561420	563820	day sovereignty movement within its borders.
563820	569340	This has to be at least partially attributed to how easy it has always been to spread information
569340	570340	across the country.
570340	575660	It may be obsolete today, but the post office was once the peak of innovation—so much
575660	582740	so that it made America.

585120	590040	This past weekend I traveled Transatlantic with my new Away suitcase and I can now honestly
590040	592280	say it's the perfect suitcase.
592280	594320	It's just wonderfully designed.
594320	598120	It looks great and has a built-in TSA approved lock on the top.
598120	602640	Inside, you put bulky stuff on the left held in by the mesh and clothes on the right to
602640	604120	be compressed by straps.
604120	609660	It has a spot for a laptop and even a waterproof laundry bag to fill up as you go.
609660	614140	By far the best feature, though, has to be the built-in battery to charge your phone,
614140	616700	tablet, or anything else powered by USB.
616700	620420	It can charge your iPhone up to five times so that you know that you'll always have
620420	621980	a charge when you're on the go.
621980	627200	You can get your Away suitcase with $20 off and free shipping within the contiguous United
627200	633140	States by going to awaytravel.com slash wendover and using the code wendover at checkout.
