00:09.560 --> 00:11.720
The post office made America.

00:11.720 --> 00:17.000
It's an ambitious claim, I know, but without it, the United States as we know it today

00:17.000 --> 00:18.860
would not exist.

00:18.860 --> 00:23.540
As author Winifred Gallagher eloquently pointed out in her book How the Post Office Created

00:23.540 --> 00:27.620
America, in the years following the American Revolution, one didn't say, the United States

00:27.620 --> 00:30.940
is, they said, the United States are.

00:30.940 --> 00:34.540
The country at the time was just a loose collectivity of states.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.300
The national government was weak.

00:36.300 --> 00:39.960
People identified with their state first and their country second.

00:39.960 --> 00:44.540
With the opening of the post office, however, Americans across the continent had, for the

00:44.540 --> 00:49.160
first time, a direct link to the federal government and the outside world.

00:49.160 --> 00:53.340
In the New England colonies that preceded the United States, infrastructure was poor.

00:53.340 --> 00:57.460
It was considered a great achievement when travelers could finally reach New York from

00:57.460 --> 00:58.980
Boston in under a week.

00:58.980 --> 01:03.700
There was little emphasis on creating roads between colonies since each was a unique,

01:03.700 --> 01:05.220
independent entity.

01:05.220 --> 01:09.180
Some have even attributed the colonists' lack of attachment to the crown to their lack

01:09.180 --> 01:10.400
of roads.

01:10.400 --> 01:14.940
Those living outside of cities might have never met a royal official in their lives

01:14.940 --> 01:17.780
just because of how hard it was to get around.

01:17.780 --> 01:22.820
Given this, the crown's postal system in the colonies was slow, expensive, and emphasized

01:22.820 --> 01:27.820
links across the Atlantic to Britain almost more than it did links between the colonies.

01:27.820 --> 01:32.100
Before the American Revolution, there were unofficial, almost black market ways of getting

01:32.100 --> 01:36.860
mail around, but the increasingly legitimate Continental Congress—the group that eventually

01:36.860 --> 01:42.060
declared American independence—realized that in order to properly coordinate and collaborate,

01:42.060 --> 01:45.700
the member colonists needed a way to effectively communicate.

01:45.700 --> 01:51.140
Therefore, surprisingly, the United States post office was founded almost a full year

01:51.140 --> 01:53.980
before the United States itself.

01:53.980 --> 01:58.880
In the century following its founding, the US had a bit of a good problem—it expanded

01:58.880 --> 02:02.480
in territory faster than it could expand in people.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.700
For much of its history and still to an extent today, the United States was a country of

02:06.700 --> 02:09.140
vast, untamed wilderness.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.340
This was especially true in the early years to the west of the Appalachians.

02:13.340 --> 02:18.780
Despite the gold rush, California only hit a population of 1 million in about 1890.

02:18.780 --> 02:23.340
By that time, the nation had a population of over 60 million and between California

02:23.340 --> 02:28.740
and the Appalachians during the early 1800s, there was hardly anything—especially roads.

02:28.740 --> 02:31.540
California might as well have been an island.

02:31.540 --> 02:35.900
To get there, most people and mail would take a steamship down to Panama, cross the country

02:35.900 --> 02:40.920
on land, and then re-board a ship to California rather than attempting to cross the continent

02:40.920 --> 02:42.240
by land.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.060
People were naturally afraid to settle the frontier.

02:45.060 --> 02:50.500
The idea of being physically and informationally detached from the civilized world while surrounded

02:50.500 --> 02:56.140
by untamed and dangerous wilderness made it difficult for the new nation to push west.

02:56.140 --> 03:01.740
You have to remember that until the telegraph became widespread in the 1850s and 60s, mail

03:01.740 --> 03:06.180
was quite literally the only way to communicate long distance.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.760
If you had a post office, you were connected.

03:08.760 --> 03:10.780
If you didn't, you were alone.

03:10.780 --> 03:15.580
Therefore, one of the first steps for a new town to legitimize itself was to appeal to

03:15.580 --> 03:19.860
the federal government for a post office and this was usually granted.

03:19.860 --> 03:25.220
Having a physical vestige of the federal government in towns across the continent was immensely

03:25.220 --> 03:26.420
beneficial.

03:26.420 --> 03:31.020
Many would even say it played a large role in America's success.

03:31.020 --> 03:37.140
You see the US today as a fiercely nationalistic country, but as mentioned, for a while, state

03:37.140 --> 03:38.660
came before country.

03:38.660 --> 03:44.580
However, these new brick and mortar representations of the power and benefit of the federal government

03:44.580 --> 03:49.820
helped tie the nation together, but the post office's impact didn't stop at its mere

03:49.820 --> 03:51.460
existence.

03:51.460 --> 03:56.820
Newspapers shipped free, or at least close to free, and that revolutionized the spread

03:56.820 --> 03:57.820
of information.

03:57.820 --> 04:03.620
In the 1850s, this meant that someone in brand new Houston, Texas could read a newspaper

04:03.620 --> 04:06.980
just as easily as someone in Washington DC.

04:06.980 --> 04:11.300
If it had been more difficult to distribute national newspapers, individuals wouldn't

04:11.300 --> 04:14.100
have had information on national politics.

04:14.100 --> 04:19.180
Without knowledge of national politics, the state might have stayed as the dominant entity.

04:19.180 --> 04:23.660
The long overland routes to tiny frontier towns absolutely did not make money, but the

04:23.660 --> 04:26.720
post office wasn't supposed to make money at the time.

04:26.720 --> 04:31.780
It was there to make living in a frontier town of 1,000 as similar as possible to living

04:31.780 --> 04:34.540
in an east coast town of 100,000.

04:34.900 --> 04:40.380
150 years ago, it took more than a month and a half to travel to many parts of the frontier

04:40.380 --> 04:43.020
from New York—if you could get to them at all.

04:43.020 --> 04:48.500
However, the post offices needed faster routes so it created post roads—long rudimentary

04:48.500 --> 04:49.820
overland routes.

04:49.820 --> 04:55.180
With time and traffic, however, these post roads developed into America's first interstate

04:55.180 --> 04:56.180
roads.

04:56.180 --> 04:59.020
The informational links led to physical links.

04:59.020 --> 05:05.360
A big question, however, was how to efficiently get the mail out into and across the frontier.

05:05.360 --> 05:12.020
In 1860, the railroad ended in western Missouri and after that the mail had to go out overland.

05:12.020 --> 05:16.340
The Pony Express was a short-lived commercial express mail service connecting the end of

05:16.340 --> 05:18.040
the railroad to California.

05:18.040 --> 05:22.000
In only ten days, it could get a letter from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.140
This was unbelievable at the time.

05:24.140 --> 05:28.340
Once mail arrived at the end of the railroad line in St. Joseph's, Missouri, a writer

05:28.340 --> 05:33.540
would take the pouch of mail and immediately start riding west at up to 25 miles per hour—full

05:33.540 --> 05:38.140
speed—and then every ten or so miles they'd stop at a Pony Express station to switch to

05:38.140 --> 05:39.380
a fresh horse.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.780
Every 75 miles, they'd switch riders to keep the mail pouch thundering across the

05:43.780 --> 05:45.940
country day and night.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.060
This didn't come cheap.

05:47.060 --> 05:53.060
It was the equivalent of $130 to send just one half ounce letter, but time is money and

05:53.060 --> 05:54.060
people did pay.

05:54.260 --> 05:59.540
One of the most famous rides of the short-lived Pony Express was following the 1860 election.

05:59.540 --> 06:03.540
Telegraph did exist at the time but it didn't stretch all the way across the country.

06:03.540 --> 06:08.300
The eastern line ended in Fort Kearney, Nebraska so following the news of Lincoln's win,

06:08.300 --> 06:10.140
a writer set out west.

06:10.140 --> 06:14.380
Using the relay system, writers made their way across the country to Fort Churchill,

06:14.380 --> 06:18.140
Nevada—the beginning of the western telegraph line—to transmit the news.

06:18.140 --> 06:22.780
The west coast papers therefore published the news of Lincoln's win only seven days

06:22.780 --> 06:25.820
and seventeen hours behind the east coast papers.

06:25.820 --> 06:30.720
Just two years earlier, it took seventeen days for news to cross the continent.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.380
This was an unbelievable feat.

06:33.380 --> 06:38.580
With the completion of the transcontinental telegraph line in 1861, however, the Pony

06:38.580 --> 06:44.420
Express closed its doors after only 19 months of operation, but it did play a big role in

06:44.420 --> 06:46.280
the innovation of mail systems.

06:46.280 --> 06:51.020
As mail volume rose to the west coast, the US post office looked for ways to further

06:51.020 --> 06:53.860
shorten the travel time across the continent.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.860
Until the opening of the transcontinental railroad in 1863, most transcontinental mail

06:58.860 --> 07:03.980
went out to Missouri by rail before switching to lower cost stagecoach rather than the Pony

07:03.980 --> 07:05.180
Express.

07:05.180 --> 07:10.820
At first all westward mail was put on the train to be sorted in Missouri, but in 1862,

07:10.820 --> 07:14.460
the first post office on wheels was put into operation.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.640
A staffer would sort the mail while on the move in an identical way as a post office

07:18.640 --> 07:23.480
on land so when it arrived in St. Joseph's, Missouri it was all split up in different

07:23.480 --> 07:25.840
bundles for different destinations.

07:25.840 --> 07:30.760
This system proved incredibly successful and in the coming decades, the post office gave

07:30.760 --> 07:36.120
exorbitant subsidies and payments to railroads across the country to move mail.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.820
Most lines to small communities would never have been financially viable without the post

07:40.820 --> 07:42.820
office contracts they attracted.

07:42.820 --> 07:48.160
The post office, therefore, was instrumental in physically connecting small towns across

07:48.160 --> 07:50.900
America to the outside world.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.600
Expansion was getting easy.

07:52.600 --> 07:57.080
This role in innovation happened once again in the 1920s.

07:57.080 --> 08:02.820
Aviation became big during World War I, but once peace was settled it almost became irrelevant.

08:02.820 --> 08:06.000
Civil aviation was at first nearly non-existent.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.620
Just months after the end of World War I, however, the first regularly scheduled airmail

08:10.620 --> 08:13.220
route between DC and New York began.

08:13.220 --> 08:19.500
By 1925, airmail routes stretched to hundreds of towns all across the United States.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.960
Just like with the railroad, the post's subsidies allowed for air service to towns

08:23.960 --> 08:27.920
that would never have been profitable with passenger only flights.

08:27.920 --> 08:32.360
The US airmail service grew to become the largest in the world making the US one of

08:32.360 --> 08:37.540
the most connected countries in the world and its legacy still survives today.

08:37.540 --> 08:42.240
Many of the airlines that merged into United, Delta, and American Airlines were founded

08:42.240 --> 08:43.680
as airmail operators.

08:43.680 --> 08:49.880
It's easy to forget that 200 years ago, only 8 million people lived in the 20 states

08:49.880 --> 08:52.560
and 4 territories that formed the union.

08:52.560 --> 08:57.160
The continent filled in incredibly fast and a lot of the credit has to be given to the

08:57.160 --> 08:58.560
postal system.

08:58.560 --> 09:02.920
Few countries as large as the US have such a strong national identity.

09:02.920 --> 09:07.480
The spread of information is one of the greatest determinants of a country's success and

09:07.480 --> 09:13.720
it's unlikely the US would be such a global superpower today without the education, connectivity,

09:13.720 --> 09:16.180
and innovation that the post office brought.

09:16.180 --> 09:21.420
Of the five largest countries in the world, the US is the only to not have a serious present

09:21.420 --> 09:23.820
day sovereignty movement within its borders.

09:23.820 --> 09:29.340
This has to be at least partially attributed to how easy it has always been to spread information

09:29.340 --> 09:30.340
across the country.

09:30.340 --> 09:35.660
It may be obsolete today, but the post office was once the peak of innovation—so much

09:35.660 --> 09:42.740
so that it made America.

09:42.740 --> 09:45.120
This video was made possible by Away.

09:45.120 --> 09:50.040
This past weekend I traveled Transatlantic with my new Away suitcase and I can now honestly

09:50.040 --> 09:52.280
say it's the perfect suitcase.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.320
It's just wonderfully designed.

09:54.320 --> 09:58.120
It looks great and has a built-in TSA approved lock on the top.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.640
Inside, you put bulky stuff on the left held in by the mesh and clothes on the right to

10:02.640 --> 10:04.120
be compressed by straps.

10:04.120 --> 10:09.660
It has a spot for a laptop and even a waterproof laundry bag to fill up as you go.

10:09.660 --> 10:14.140
By far the best feature, though, has to be the built-in battery to charge your phone,

10:14.140 --> 10:16.700
tablet, or anything else powered by USB.

10:16.700 --> 10:20.420
It can charge your iPhone up to five times so that you know that you'll always have

10:20.420 --> 10:21.980
a charge when you're on the go.

10:21.980 --> 10:27.200
You can get your Away suitcase with $20 off and free shipping within the contiguous United

10:27.200 --> 10:33.140
