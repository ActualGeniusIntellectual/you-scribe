00:09.980 --> 00:15.180
The South Pole is, without a doubt, one of the most extreme places on earth that's

00:15.180 --> 00:17.580
continuously inhabited by humans.

00:17.580 --> 00:22.380
In fact, it's safe to say that there's nowhere on earth with such a large population—about

00:22.380 --> 00:28.660
45 in the winter and 150 in the summer—where nature is so constantly working to kill you.

00:28.660 --> 00:33.460
The warmest it's ever been at the pole, in recorded history, is just 10 degrees Fahrenheit

00:33.460 --> 00:38.300
or negative 12 degrees Celsius—a temperature that most of the world would consider absolutely

00:38.300 --> 00:44.280
unbearable, while most of the year is spent at 50 or 60 below zero, but it's not just

00:44.280 --> 00:47.340
temperature that gives the pole its extreme classification.

00:47.340 --> 00:52.180
It's also one of the driest places on earth, with a relative humidity regularly dipping

00:52.180 --> 00:54.900
to 0.03%.

00:54.900 --> 01:00.920
In comparison, most places' humidity hovers between 55 and 75%, meaning that those at

01:00.920 --> 01:05.540
the South Pole are constantly battling skin and body dehydration.

01:05.540 --> 01:10.220
In addition to all that, due to the thousands of feet of ice and snow layered on top of

01:10.220 --> 01:16.180
the ground below, the pole is located at around 9,300 feet or 2,800 meters above sea level,

01:16.180 --> 01:19.580
which for most people isn't high enough to be deadly, but is enough to potentially

01:19.580 --> 01:23.760
lead to sickness which could elevate the severity of other conditions.

01:23.760 --> 01:28.560
Put together, these factors compound to paint a pretty clear picture.

01:28.560 --> 01:34.200
The South Pole was not made for humans, but nonetheless, through sheer force of will,

01:34.200 --> 01:36.840
we're there permanently.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.280
What makes this possible is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.

01:41.280 --> 01:44.820
This American-run facility is now in its third iteration.

01:44.820 --> 01:49.920
The first was built in 1956 as a simple, wooden, prefabricated structure that quickly became

01:49.920 --> 01:51.500
buried by snow.

01:51.500 --> 01:57.060
This was upgraded in 1974 to a larger geodesic dome that itself protected buildings inside,

01:57.060 --> 02:01.460
and this too was buried by snow each winter, meaning that each summer, considerable time

02:01.460 --> 02:04.720
and fuel had to be used to dig the station out.

02:04.720 --> 02:09.180
In a place where absolutely everything has to be flown in, this was an enormous expense

02:09.180 --> 02:11.580
that got in the way of the science.

02:11.580 --> 02:15.800
Therefore, in the years leading up to the turn of the millennia, the United States Antarctic

02:15.800 --> 02:20.420
Program worked to develop a more permanent solution.

02:20.420 --> 02:22.700
And that solution was this.

02:22.700 --> 02:27.700
Now, this current structure is undoubtedly distinctive, but its design comes with good

02:27.700 --> 02:28.780
reason.

02:28.780 --> 02:33.300
The building itself is shaped like an airplane wing, with a leading edge facing the prevailing

02:33.300 --> 02:34.300
winds.

02:34.300 --> 02:38.940
This pushes air down, accelerating it underneath the facility, which naturally clears out the

02:38.940 --> 02:39.940
snow.

02:39.940 --> 02:44.860
As most of Antarctica is a desert, only about 8 inches or 20 centimeters of snow per year

02:44.860 --> 02:49.380
accumulates at the South Pole, but as the temperature quite literally never goes above

02:49.380 --> 02:52.100
freezing, the snow never melts.

02:52.100 --> 02:56.260
In addition, since the landscape surrounding the pole is quite flat, and the winds are

02:56.260 --> 03:00.980
strong, enormous snowbanks quickly form on the upwind side of any building.

03:00.980 --> 03:05.340
While the shape of the main station building reduces this, snow still does accumulate in

03:05.340 --> 03:06.900
front and under it.

03:06.900 --> 03:11.500
Therefore, it's designed so that, every 10 to 15 years, the structure will be raised

03:11.500 --> 03:13.380
up a few feet.

03:13.380 --> 03:17.320
This is a 30-day process, which can only happen over the three-month summer period when the

03:17.320 --> 03:21.440
station can be reached by plane, meaning that in order to not shut down the facility during

03:21.440 --> 03:25.840
its busiest period, the building was designed to be operational while it's lifted.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.280
Therefore, its different components are connected by a number of flexible joints that can move

03:30.280 --> 03:32.760
during the lifting process.

03:32.760 --> 03:37.920
Of course, the actual purpose of the station is for research, but that poses the question,

03:37.920 --> 03:41.840
what sort of research do you actually need to be at the South Pole for?

03:41.840 --> 03:45.160
Well, as it turns out, quite a lot.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.680
One of the top uses is for astronomy.

03:47.680 --> 03:52.520
You see, in most places, water vapor in the air ever so slightly distorts the image from

03:52.520 --> 03:56.420
telescopes, which for most types of astronomy isn't a problem, but when one is trying

03:56.420 --> 04:01.960
to observe galaxies billions of light-years away, for example, precision is key.

04:01.960 --> 04:08.560
In fact, the South Pole telescope itself has discovered truly countless far-away galaxies.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.040
In addition, thanks to this clarity, it was a crucial component of the planet-wide network

04:13.040 --> 04:18.400
of telescopes that created the first-ever direct image of a black hole in 2019.

04:18.400 --> 04:23.080
Beyond that, the clean air of the pole allows for super-precise atmospheric research, and

04:23.080 --> 04:27.400
the relatively low annual accumulation allows for climate research through studying ice

04:27.400 --> 04:28.540
cores.

04:28.540 --> 04:33.360
This is all to say, the South Pole station isn't just there for prestige—it's a

04:33.360 --> 04:39.120
critical piece of scientific infrastructure supporting a huge variety of research.

04:39.200 --> 04:44.400
However, most of the research itself isn't actually conducted there.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.320
Given how expensive it is to travel to the pole, various institutions generally only

04:48.320 --> 04:52.200
send a small number of people to the station to calibrate and maintain their scientific

04:52.200 --> 04:57.140
equipment, while the data are sent back to their respective headquarters for analysis.

04:57.140 --> 05:01.180
That means that, each summer, in that three-month window when flights can land, there's a

05:01.180 --> 05:06.360
flurry of activity as personnel try to get all their work done before the season is over.

05:06.600 --> 05:11.880
Then, over winter, only a skeleton crew remains to keep everything running.

05:11.880 --> 05:16.580
Of course, given the absolute isolation that occurs over this period, the station staff

05:16.580 --> 05:18.840
is very carefully selected.

05:18.840 --> 05:22.640
Everyone is screened to assure that they're in near-perfect physical health, as conditions

05:22.640 --> 05:26.580
that might be minor in the rest of the world can turn deadly given the station's lack

05:26.580 --> 05:31.520
of advanced medical care, and they're also subject to extensive psychological evaluation.

05:31.520 --> 05:35.560
This is primarily to assure that they can handle this severe degree of isolation, six

05:35.560 --> 05:40.520
months of continuous darkness, and small work community for nine months as, if mental health

05:40.520 --> 05:45.660
deteriorates over winter, there's truly no way out.

05:45.660 --> 05:49.880
Over this period, there tends to only be a single doctor at the station, conducting their

05:49.880 --> 05:52.700
work with somewhat limited medical facilities.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.600
This doctor is subject to even more rigorous medical screening themselves, given their

05:56.600 --> 05:59.800
importance to the health of everyone else at the facility.

05:59.800 --> 06:04.000
In fact, some countries' Antarctic programs even require their doctors to have their appendix

06:04.000 --> 06:07.580
removed to prevent the possibility of appendicitis.

06:07.580 --> 06:12.300
Of course, a single doctor can't know everything, so for any advanced conditions that arise

06:12.300 --> 06:17.020
with station staff, the facility is outfitted with advanced telemedicine equipment which

06:17.020 --> 06:21.620
can transmit medical data in real time, so specialists in the US can attempt to diagnose

06:21.620 --> 06:24.080
and treat a patient remotely.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.860
Of course, in order to do that, they need internet, which is yet another challenge at

06:28.860 --> 06:30.600
the South Pole.

06:30.600 --> 06:35.400
Most non-polar, isolated research stations now are able to rely completely on commercial

06:35.400 --> 06:40.040
satellite internet providers, but that's not entirely possible at the bottom of the

06:40.040 --> 06:41.280
world.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.720
Commercial satellite internet is only widespread where there's a market, and there's only

06:44.720 --> 06:47.520
a market where there are lots of people.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.740
That means that most telecommunications satellites are not positioned in an orbit that the South

06:51.740 --> 06:53.920
Pole can reliably view.

06:53.920 --> 06:58.520
Therefore, the station has to largely count on the NASA network of communications satellites

06:58.520 --> 07:00.760
designed to link spacecraft to Earth.

07:00.760 --> 07:04.880
In fact, this network is the very one the International Space Station uses for data

07:04.880 --> 07:06.520
up and downlink.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.840
Even this system, though, is only in view of the pole a few times per day.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.740
On November 13th, 2020, for example, the South Pole could connect to one of its satellites

07:14.740 --> 07:22.240
from 3.29 to 3.55 pm, 4.59 to 7.05 pm, and 8.09 to 9.27 pm, meaning they only had a connection

07:22.240 --> 07:25.640
for three hours and fifty minutes that day.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.340
These NASA satellites provide the bulk of the station's data connection, with an overall

07:29.340 --> 07:34.280
capacity of 275 megabits per second, meaning they use these short passes to transmit the

07:34.280 --> 07:38.200
bulk of the scientific data back to the outside world, and this is also the time when it's

07:38.200 --> 07:41.280
possible for the station staff to use the internet themselves to connect with their

07:41.280 --> 07:43.080
families or friends.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.840
The station supplements this connection, though, with a daily four and a half hour pass by

07:46.840 --> 07:52.120
a UK Ministry of Defense communications satellite, which provides a much leaner 1.54 megabits

07:52.120 --> 07:57.280
per second data link, and a subsequent four-hour pass by a US military communications satellite,

07:57.280 --> 08:02.360
which allows for 10 megabits per second of uplink and 30 megabits per second of downlink.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.740
For the rest of the day, the station only has a very rudimentary 38 kilobits per second

08:06.740 --> 08:11.320
data link through the Iridium satellite network, meaning, for all but the most urgent communications,

08:11.320 --> 08:14.440
it's cut off from the world.

08:14.440 --> 08:19.000
Beyond that, even just taking out the trash is difficult at the South Pole.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.280
The station is required by international law to limit waste as much as possible, and this

08:23.280 --> 08:27.280
means that nearly everything brought in is eventually brought out.

08:27.280 --> 08:31.260
All trash and recycling is collected during the winter season, and flown back to the much

08:31.260 --> 08:33.160
larger McMurdo station.

08:33.160 --> 08:37.260
There, recycling is processed, while trash is grouped together and stored to be sent

08:37.260 --> 08:41.300
all the way back to the US on the single annual resupply ship.

08:41.300 --> 08:46.200
That means that any garbage will travel 8,000 miles or 13,000 kilometers over a period of

08:46.200 --> 08:50.720
up to a year from a trash can at the South Pole station to a landfill in the US in order

08:50.720 --> 08:52.500
to be disposed of.

08:52.500 --> 08:57.880
The reason for this obsessiveness around cleanliness goes beyond environmental consciousness—it's

08:57.880 --> 09:00.200
crucial to the science conducted there.

09:00.200 --> 09:04.600
For example, there's a zone that stretches 98 miles or 150 kilometers northwest of the

09:04.600 --> 09:07.920
station where no motor vehicles at all are allowed.

09:07.920 --> 09:12.240
That's because this zone is upwind from the station's Atmospheric Research Station,

09:12.240 --> 09:16.520
which is located there due to the pollutant-free air, and the exhaust of one snowmobile could

09:16.520 --> 09:20.840
contaminate the air enough to throw off the observations, potentially complicating some

09:20.840 --> 09:21.840
research.

09:21.840 --> 09:26.860
Now, it's worth pointing out that this structure, the South Pole station, is the only thing

09:26.860 --> 09:31.620
separating the staff of the facility from the deadly Antarctic environment, and, for

09:31.620 --> 09:36.000
nine months a year, the facility is entirely unreachable.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.080
Outside of the summer season, stretching from November to mid-February, the weather is simply

09:40.080 --> 09:45.040
too harsh for planes to land with any degree of safety, so if this facility fails, there

09:45.040 --> 09:48.460
is almost zero opportunity for evacuation.

09:48.460 --> 09:53.080
To put this into perspective, if the International Space Station fails, for example, astronauts

09:53.080 --> 09:57.800
can almost immediately load into the spacecraft they came in and return to earth.

09:57.800 --> 10:01.840
At the South Pole, even if it were life or death, and even if a pilot was willing to

10:01.840 --> 10:05.980
put their life on the line to get to the pole, there are stretches of weeks when the weather

10:05.980 --> 10:11.460
makes it physically impossible to get a plane on the ground in one piece.

10:11.460 --> 10:16.200
However, in very limited circumstances, when it becomes clear that someone has developed

10:16.200 --> 10:20.140
a medical condition severe enough that they will not make it till summer, and when there's

10:20.140 --> 10:23.860
a flight crew willing to put their lives on the line to save another's, the Antarctic

10:23.860 --> 10:27.720
program has authorized attempts at evacuation.

10:27.720 --> 10:31.000
This has only happened successfully three times.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.380
Each of these flights was conducted by extremely experienced pilots from Ken Borick Air, a

10:35.380 --> 10:39.140
Canadian airline accustomed to operating at the poles, in small, twin-order aircraft—one

10:39.140 --> 10:42.400
of the only types that can withstand the Antarctic winter cold.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.860
These aircraft had to be ferried down from Canada, and then landed and held short of

10:45.860 --> 10:49.740
the continent for a number of days while waiting for a weather window to fly further south

10:49.740 --> 10:51.060
to the pole.

10:51.060 --> 10:55.160
Once that happened, though, they flew the final stretch and landed in darkness, quickly

10:55.160 --> 10:59.280
picking up their patient before the aircraft froze, and then flew to South America to reach

10:59.280 --> 11:01.020
an advanced hospital.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.140
With these evacuations, it took more than a week to actually get an aircraft down to

11:05.140 --> 11:10.540
the pole, so if something went catastrophically wrong that made the entire station uninhabitable,

11:10.540 --> 11:14.940
like a fire, for example, there'd be little chance of getting everyone out in time.

11:14.940 --> 11:20.200
That's why there's a smaller, self-sufficient, fireproof wing of the station designated as

11:20.200 --> 11:22.180
an emergency lifeboat.

11:22.180 --> 11:26.660
This has a kitchen, a small living area, a dedicated generator, a water treatment plant,

11:26.660 --> 11:30.340
and it's designed to be able to keep the station staff alive through the winter until

11:30.340 --> 11:34.420
an evacuation is possible, if the rest of the station fails.

11:34.420 --> 11:39.220
All in all, the 45 or so people living at the South Pole over the winter have to be,

11:39.220 --> 11:44.020
in the most true sense possible, self-sufficient, because there is almost no opportunity for

11:44.020 --> 11:49.100
outside help, and that's exactly what makes it so dangerous.

11:49.100 --> 11:53.320
This season, though, the potential for danger is escalated.

11:53.320 --> 11:58.160
Right now, in November 2020, the South Pole is reconnecting to the world, for the first

11:58.160 --> 12:02.020
time since February 14th, as its summer season gets started.

12:02.020 --> 12:07.700
Now, the world has obviously changed a lot between February and November, but Antarctica

12:07.700 --> 12:09.960
has pretty much stayed the same.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.300
Up until now, COVID was not a threat to the continent, since it severed its link to the

12:14.300 --> 12:17.060
world before the virus became widespread.

12:17.060 --> 12:22.020
Antarctica is currently the only COVID-free continent, and it's crucial it stays that

12:22.020 --> 12:23.020
way.

12:23.020 --> 12:27.420
In the cramped facilities of the various spaces, social distancing is impossible, one case

12:27.420 --> 12:31.720
can turn into a major outbreak very quickly, and there's really no ability for the intensive

12:31.720 --> 12:34.400
care that severe cases require.

12:34.400 --> 12:39.360
If the virus took hold in the Antarctic population, a winter season, with limited possibility

12:39.360 --> 12:44.240
for evacuation, could become very difficult or impossible.

12:44.240 --> 12:49.220
Therefore, all staff is now intensely tested and quarantined for at least two weeks before

12:49.220 --> 12:53.080
flying to the continent, and the stations are implementing policies such as mask wearing

12:53.080 --> 12:55.640
for the first time as an extra precaution.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.760
Also, this season's activities have been scaled back to essentially the bare minimum

12:59.760 --> 13:03.480
required to keep the science going, such as crucial maintenance and resupply, and so

13:03.480 --> 13:06.880
almost all construction projects have been cancelled.

13:06.880 --> 13:12.320
That means that McMurdo Station, for example, will have a peak population of just 450 compared

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
to 1,250 normally.

13:14.320 --> 13:19.920
It's tough to understate how tough it is to live year-round at the South Pole, and

13:19.920 --> 13:23.420
COVID is making it even more challenging.

13:23.420 --> 13:27.440
Life at the bottom of the world is certainly an adventure, but it's one that requires

13:27.440 --> 13:32.680
spending the vast majority of the year indoors, in a single building, with a small number

13:32.680 --> 13:33.680
of people.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.960
It's undoubtedly a sacrifice.

13:36.960 --> 13:41.000
Most of those living and working there don't do so because it's fun, because for the

13:41.000 --> 13:47.200
most part, it's not, but rather, they do so because they believe so deeply and fundamentally

13:47.200 --> 13:54.360
that the science, even in the face of extreme adversity, is worth it.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.200
Because Wendover Productions has grown into a more fully-fledged business over the years,

13:58.200 --> 14:02.560
it's more important than ever that we present ourselves professionally.

14:02.560 --> 14:06.720
In my opinion, a crucial component of that is making sure that the email addresses we

14:06.720 --> 14:11.200
use to communicate with sponsors, interview subjects, and others are unique and professional,

14:11.200 --> 14:13.720
so that's why I use Hover.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.160
They helped me find our Wendover.Productions domain, which I purchased for a super-reasonable

14:18.160 --> 14:22.520
price, then I was able to set up custom email addresses ending in "@Wendover.Productions

14:22.520 --> 14:24.760
in quite literally 30 seconds."

14:24.760 --> 14:29.800
Nowadays, having an email ending in Gmail or Yahoo or iCloud just doesn't cut it—it

14:29.800 --> 14:34.680
just looks unprofessional—and through Hover, setting up a custom email at your domain really

14:34.680 --> 14:36.580
isn't expensive at all.

14:36.580 --> 14:40.440
Hover also lets you buy a custom domain, which you can use for your website, or you can set

14:40.440 --> 14:44.120
up to forward to your YouTube channel, your LinkedIn account, your Twitter, really anything.

14:44.120 --> 14:49.400
Thanks to their hundreds of domain extensions, you can go way beyond .com or .net and create

14:49.400 --> 14:52.800
a super-unique domain like Wendover.Productions.

14:52.800 --> 14:57.840
All in all, if you want a professional, unique email and domain, Hover is the place to get

14:57.840 --> 15:00.600
it, and it's worth getting now before it's gone.

15:00.600 --> 15:04.800
What's more, by going to Hover.com slash Wendover, you'll get 10% off your first

15:04.800 --> 15:08.080
purchase and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
