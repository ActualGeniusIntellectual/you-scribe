3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,180
The South Pole is, without a doubt, one of the most extreme places on earth that's

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,580
continuously inhabited by humans.

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,380
In fact, it's safe to say that there's nowhere on earth with such a large population—about

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,660
45 in the winter and 150 in the summer—where nature is so constantly working to kill you.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,460
The warmest it's ever been at the pole, in recorded history, is just 10 degrees Fahrenheit

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,300
or negative 12 degrees Celsius—a temperature that most of the world would consider absolutely

9
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,280
unbearable, while most of the year is spent at 50 or 60 below zero, but it's not just

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,340
temperature that gives the pole its extreme classification.

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,180
It's also one of the driest places on earth, with a relative humidity regularly dipping

12
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,900
to 0.03%.

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,920
In comparison, most places' humidity hovers between 55 and 75%, meaning that those at

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,540
the South Pole are constantly battling skin and body dehydration.

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,220
In addition to all that, due to the thousands of feet of ice and snow layered on top of

16
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,180
the ground below, the pole is located at around 9,300 feet or 2,800 meters above sea level,

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,580
which for most people isn't high enough to be deadly, but is enough to potentially

18
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,760
lead to sickness which could elevate the severity of other conditions.

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,560
Put together, these factors compound to paint a pretty clear picture.

20
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,200
The South Pole was not made for humans, but nonetheless, through sheer force of will,

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,840
we're there permanently.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
What makes this possible is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.

23
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,820
This American-run facility is now in its third iteration.

24
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,920
The first was built in 1956 as a simple, wooden, prefabricated structure that quickly became

25
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,500
buried by snow.

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,060
This was upgraded in 1974 to a larger geodesic dome that itself protected buildings inside,

27
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,460
and this too was buried by snow each winter, meaning that each summer, considerable time

28
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,720
and fuel had to be used to dig the station out.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,180
In a place where absolutely everything has to be flown in, this was an enormous expense

30
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,580
that got in the way of the science.

31
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,800
Therefore, in the years leading up to the turn of the millennia, the United States Antarctic

32
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,420
Program worked to develop a more permanent solution.

33
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,700
And that solution was this.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Now, this current structure is undoubtedly distinctive, but its design comes with good

35
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,780
reason.

36
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,300
The building itself is shaped like an airplane wing, with a leading edge facing the prevailing

37
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,300
winds.

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,940
This pushes air down, accelerating it underneath the facility, which naturally clears out the

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
snow.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,860
As most of Antarctica is a desert, only about 8 inches or 20 centimeters of snow per year

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,380
accumulates at the South Pole, but as the temperature quite literally never goes above

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,100
freezing, the snow never melts.

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,260
In addition, since the landscape surrounding the pole is quite flat, and the winds are

44
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,980
strong, enormous snowbanks quickly form on the upwind side of any building.

45
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,340
While the shape of the main station building reduces this, snow still does accumulate in

46
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,900
front and under it.

47
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,500
Therefore, it's designed so that, every 10 to 15 years, the structure will be raised

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,380
up a few feet.

49
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,320
This is a 30-day process, which can only happen over the three-month summer period when the

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,440
station can be reached by plane, meaning that in order to not shut down the facility during

51
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,840
its busiest period, the building was designed to be operational while it's lifted.

52
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,280
Therefore, its different components are connected by a number of flexible joints that can move

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,760
during the lifting process.

54
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Of course, the actual purpose of the station is for research, but that poses the question,

55
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
what sort of research do you actually need to be at the South Pole for?

56
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,160
Well, as it turns out, quite a lot.

57
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,680
One of the top uses is for astronomy.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,520
You see, in most places, water vapor in the air ever so slightly distorts the image from

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,420
telescopes, which for most types of astronomy isn't a problem, but when one is trying

60
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,960
to observe galaxies billions of light-years away, for example, precision is key.

61
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:08,560
In fact, the South Pole telescope itself has discovered truly countless far-away galaxies.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,040
In addition, thanks to this clarity, it was a crucial component of the planet-wide network

63
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,400
of telescopes that created the first-ever direct image of a black hole in 2019.

64
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,080
Beyond that, the clean air of the pole allows for super-precise atmospheric research, and

65
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,400
the relatively low annual accumulation allows for climate research through studying ice

66
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,540
cores.

67
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,360
This is all to say, the South Pole station isn't just there for prestige—it's a

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,120
critical piece of scientific infrastructure supporting a huge variety of research.

69
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,400
However, most of the research itself isn't actually conducted there.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,320
Given how expensive it is to travel to the pole, various institutions generally only

71
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,200
send a small number of people to the station to calibrate and maintain their scientific

72
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,140
equipment, while the data are sent back to their respective headquarters for analysis.

73
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,180
That means that, each summer, in that three-month window when flights can land, there's a

74
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,360
flurry of activity as personnel try to get all their work done before the season is over.

75
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,880
Then, over winter, only a skeleton crew remains to keep everything running.

76
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,580
Of course, given the absolute isolation that occurs over this period, the station staff

77
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,840
is very carefully selected.

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,640
Everyone is screened to assure that they're in near-perfect physical health, as conditions

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,580
that might be minor in the rest of the world can turn deadly given the station's lack

80
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,520
of advanced medical care, and they're also subject to extensive psychological evaluation.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,560
This is primarily to assure that they can handle this severe degree of isolation, six

82
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,520
months of continuous darkness, and small work community for nine months as, if mental health

83
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,660
deteriorates over winter, there's truly no way out.

84
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,880
Over this period, there tends to only be a single doctor at the station, conducting their

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,700
work with somewhat limited medical facilities.

86
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,600
This doctor is subject to even more rigorous medical screening themselves, given their

87
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,800
importance to the health of everyone else at the facility.

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,000
In fact, some countries' Antarctic programs even require their doctors to have their appendix

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,580
removed to prevent the possibility of appendicitis.

90
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,300
Of course, a single doctor can't know everything, so for any advanced conditions that arise

91
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,020
with station staff, the facility is outfitted with advanced telemedicine equipment which

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,620
can transmit medical data in real time, so specialists in the US can attempt to diagnose

93
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,080
and treat a patient remotely.

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,860
Of course, in order to do that, they need internet, which is yet another challenge at

95
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,600
the South Pole.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,400
Most non-polar, isolated research stations now are able to rely completely on commercial

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,040
satellite internet providers, but that's not entirely possible at the bottom of the

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,280
world.

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,720
Commercial satellite internet is only widespread where there's a market, and there's only

100
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,520
a market where there are lots of people.

101
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,740
That means that most telecommunications satellites are not positioned in an orbit that the South

102
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,920
Pole can reliably view.

103
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:58,520
Therefore, the station has to largely count on the NASA network of communications satellites

104
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,760
designed to link spacecraft to Earth.

105
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,880
In fact, this network is the very one the International Space Station uses for data

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,520
up and downlink.

107
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,840
Even this system, though, is only in view of the pole a few times per day.

108
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,740
On November 13th, 2020, for example, the South Pole could connect to one of its satellites

109
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:22,240
from 3.29 to 3.55 pm, 4.59 to 7.05 pm, and 8.09 to 9.27 pm, meaning they only had a connection

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,640
for three hours and fifty minutes that day.

111
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,340
These NASA satellites provide the bulk of the station's data connection, with an overall

112
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,280
capacity of 275 megabits per second, meaning they use these short passes to transmit the

113
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,200
bulk of the scientific data back to the outside world, and this is also the time when it's

114
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,280
possible for the station staff to use the internet themselves to connect with their

115
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,080
families or friends.

116
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,840
The station supplements this connection, though, with a daily four and a half hour pass by

117
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,120
a UK Ministry of Defense communications satellite, which provides a much leaner 1.54 megabits

118
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,280
per second data link, and a subsequent four-hour pass by a US military communications satellite,

119
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,360
which allows for 10 megabits per second of uplink and 30 megabits per second of downlink.

120
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,740
For the rest of the day, the station only has a very rudimentary 38 kilobits per second

121
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,320
data link through the Iridium satellite network, meaning, for all but the most urgent communications,

122
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,440
it's cut off from the world.

123
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,000
Beyond that, even just taking out the trash is difficult at the South Pole.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,280
The station is required by international law to limit waste as much as possible, and this

125
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,280
means that nearly everything brought in is eventually brought out.

126
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,260
All trash and recycling is collected during the winter season, and flown back to the much

127
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,160
larger McMurdo station.

128
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,260
There, recycling is processed, while trash is grouped together and stored to be sent

129
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,300
all the way back to the US on the single annual resupply ship.

130
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,200
That means that any garbage will travel 8,000 miles or 13,000 kilometers over a period of

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,720
up to a year from a trash can at the South Pole station to a landfill in the US in order

132
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,500
to be disposed of.

133
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,880
The reason for this obsessiveness around cleanliness goes beyond environmental consciousness—it's

134
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,200
crucial to the science conducted there.

135
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,600
For example, there's a zone that stretches 98 miles or 150 kilometers northwest of the

136
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,920
station where no motor vehicles at all are allowed.

137
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,240
That's because this zone is upwind from the station's Atmospheric Research Station,

138
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,520
which is located there due to the pollutant-free air, and the exhaust of one snowmobile could

139
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,840
contaminate the air enough to throw off the observations, potentially complicating some

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,840
research.

141
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,860
Now, it's worth pointing out that this structure, the South Pole station, is the only thing

142
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,620
separating the staff of the facility from the deadly Antarctic environment, and, for

143
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,000
nine months a year, the facility is entirely unreachable.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
Outside of the summer season, stretching from November to mid-February, the weather is simply

145
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,040
too harsh for planes to land with any degree of safety, so if this facility fails, there

146
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,460
is almost zero opportunity for evacuation.

147
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,080
To put this into perspective, if the International Space Station fails, for example, astronauts

148
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,800
can almost immediately load into the spacecraft they came in and return to earth.

149
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,840
At the South Pole, even if it were life or death, and even if a pilot was willing to

150
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,980
put their life on the line to get to the pole, there are stretches of weeks when the weather

151
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,460
makes it physically impossible to get a plane on the ground in one piece.

152
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,200
However, in very limited circumstances, when it becomes clear that someone has developed

153
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,140
a medical condition severe enough that they will not make it till summer, and when there's

154
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,860
a flight crew willing to put their lives on the line to save another's, the Antarctic

155
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,720
program has authorized attempts at evacuation.

156
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,000
This has only happened successfully three times.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,380
Each of these flights was conducted by extremely experienced pilots from Ken Borick Air, a

158
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,140
Canadian airline accustomed to operating at the poles, in small, twin-order aircraft—one

159
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:42,400
of the only types that can withstand the Antarctic winter cold.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,860
These aircraft had to be ferried down from Canada, and then landed and held short of

161
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,740
the continent for a number of days while waiting for a weather window to fly further south

162
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,060
to the pole.

163
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,160
Once that happened, though, they flew the final stretch and landed in darkness, quickly

164
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,280
picking up their patient before the aircraft froze, and then flew to South America to reach

165
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,020
an advanced hospital.

166
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,140
With these evacuations, it took more than a week to actually get an aircraft down to

167
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,540
the pole, so if something went catastrophically wrong that made the entire station uninhabitable,

168
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,940
like a fire, for example, there'd be little chance of getting everyone out in time.

169
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,200
That's why there's a smaller, self-sufficient, fireproof wing of the station designated as

170
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,180
an emergency lifeboat.

171
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,660
This has a kitchen, a small living area, a dedicated generator, a water treatment plant,

172
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,340
and it's designed to be able to keep the station staff alive through the winter until

173
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,420
an evacuation is possible, if the rest of the station fails.

174
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,220
All in all, the 45 or so people living at the South Pole over the winter have to be,

175
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,020
in the most true sense possible, self-sufficient, because there is almost no opportunity for

176
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,100
outside help, and that's exactly what makes it so dangerous.

177
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,320
This season, though, the potential for danger is escalated.

178
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Right now, in November 2020, the South Pole is reconnecting to the world, for the first

179
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,020
time since February 14th, as its summer season gets started.

180
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,700
Now, the world has obviously changed a lot between February and November, but Antarctica

181
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,960
has pretty much stayed the same.

182
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,300
Up until now, COVID was not a threat to the continent, since it severed its link to the

183
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,060
world before the virus became widespread.

184
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:22,020
Antarctica is currently the only COVID-free continent, and it's crucial it stays that

185
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
way.

186
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,420
In the cramped facilities of the various spaces, social distancing is impossible, one case

187
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,720
can turn into a major outbreak very quickly, and there's really no ability for the intensive

188
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,400
care that severe cases require.

189
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,360
If the virus took hold in the Antarctic population, a winter season, with limited possibility

190
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,240
for evacuation, could become very difficult or impossible.

191
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:49,220
Therefore, all staff is now intensely tested and quarantined for at least two weeks before

192
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,080
flying to the continent, and the stations are implementing policies such as mask wearing

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,640
for the first time as an extra precaution.

194
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,760
Also, this season's activities have been scaled back to essentially the bare minimum

195
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,480
required to keep the science going, such as crucial maintenance and resupply, and so

196
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,880
almost all construction projects have been cancelled.

197
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,320
That means that McMurdo Station, for example, will have a peak population of just 450 compared

198
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
to 1,250 normally.

199
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,920
It's tough to understate how tough it is to live year-round at the South Pole, and

200
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,420
COVID is making it even more challenging.

201
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,440
Life at the bottom of the world is certainly an adventure, but it's one that requires

202
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,680
spending the vast majority of the year indoors, in a single building, with a small number

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
of people.

204
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,960
It's undoubtedly a sacrifice.

205
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,000
Most of those living and working there don't do so because it's fun, because for the

206
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,200
most part, it's not, but rather, they do so because they believe so deeply and fundamentally

207
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,360
that the science, even in the face of extreme adversity, is worth it.

208
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Because Wendover Productions has grown into a more fully-fledged business over the years,

209
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,560
it's more important than ever that we present ourselves professionally.

210
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,720
In my opinion, a crucial component of that is making sure that the email addresses we

211
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,200
use to communicate with sponsors, interview subjects, and others are unique and professional,

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,720
so that's why I use Hover.

213
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,160
They helped me find our Wendover.Productions domain, which I purchased for a super-reasonable

214
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,520
price, then I was able to set up custom email addresses ending in "@Wendover.Productions

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,760
in quite literally 30 seconds."

216
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,800
Nowadays, having an email ending in Gmail or Yahoo or iCloud just doesn't cut it—it

217
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,680
just looks unprofessional—and through Hover, setting up a custom email at your domain really

218
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,580
isn't expensive at all.

219
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,440
Hover also lets you buy a custom domain, which you can use for your website, or you can set

220
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,120
up to forward to your YouTube channel, your LinkedIn account, your Twitter, really anything.

221
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,400
Thanks to their hundreds of domain extensions, you can go way beyond .com or .net and create

222
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,800
a super-unique domain like Wendover.Productions.

223
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,840
All in all, if you want a professional, unique email and domain, Hover is the place to get

224
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,600
it, and it's worth getting now before it's gone.

225
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,800
What's more, by going to Hover.com slash Wendover, you'll get 10% off your first

226
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,080
purchase and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
