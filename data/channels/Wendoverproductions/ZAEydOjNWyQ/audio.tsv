9980	15180	The South Pole is, without a doubt, one of the most extreme places on earth that's
15180	17580	continuously inhabited by humans.
17580	22380	In fact, it's safe to say that there's nowhere on earth with such a large population—about
22380	28660	45 in the winter and 150 in the summer—where nature is so constantly working to kill you.
28660	33460	The warmest it's ever been at the pole, in recorded history, is just 10 degrees Fahrenheit
33460	38300	or negative 12 degrees Celsius—a temperature that most of the world would consider absolutely
38300	44280	unbearable, while most of the year is spent at 50 or 60 below zero, but it's not just
44280	47340	temperature that gives the pole its extreme classification.
47340	52180	It's also one of the driest places on earth, with a relative humidity regularly dipping
52180	54900	to 0.03%.
54900	60920	In comparison, most places' humidity hovers between 55 and 75%, meaning that those at
60920	65540	the South Pole are constantly battling skin and body dehydration.
65540	70220	In addition to all that, due to the thousands of feet of ice and snow layered on top of
70220	76180	the ground below, the pole is located at around 9,300 feet or 2,800 meters above sea level,
76180	79580	which for most people isn't high enough to be deadly, but is enough to potentially
79580	83760	lead to sickness which could elevate the severity of other conditions.
83760	88560	Put together, these factors compound to paint a pretty clear picture.
88560	94200	The South Pole was not made for humans, but nonetheless, through sheer force of will,
94200	96840	we're there permanently.
96840	101280	What makes this possible is the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.
101280	104820	This American-run facility is now in its third iteration.
104820	109920	The first was built in 1956 as a simple, wooden, prefabricated structure that quickly became
109920	111500	buried by snow.
111500	117060	This was upgraded in 1974 to a larger geodesic dome that itself protected buildings inside,
117060	121460	and this too was buried by snow each winter, meaning that each summer, considerable time
121460	124720	and fuel had to be used to dig the station out.
124720	129180	In a place where absolutely everything has to be flown in, this was an enormous expense
129180	131580	that got in the way of the science.
131580	135800	Therefore, in the years leading up to the turn of the millennia, the United States Antarctic
135800	140420	Program worked to develop a more permanent solution.
140420	142700	And that solution was this.
142700	147700	Now, this current structure is undoubtedly distinctive, but its design comes with good
147700	148780	reason.
148780	153300	The building itself is shaped like an airplane wing, with a leading edge facing the prevailing
153300	154300	winds.
154300	158940	This pushes air down, accelerating it underneath the facility, which naturally clears out the
158940	159940	snow.
159940	164860	As most of Antarctica is a desert, only about 8 inches or 20 centimeters of snow per year
164860	169380	accumulates at the South Pole, but as the temperature quite literally never goes above
169380	172100	freezing, the snow never melts.
172100	176260	In addition, since the landscape surrounding the pole is quite flat, and the winds are
176260	180980	strong, enormous snowbanks quickly form on the upwind side of any building.
180980	185340	While the shape of the main station building reduces this, snow still does accumulate in
185340	186900	front and under it.
186900	191500	Therefore, it's designed so that, every 10 to 15 years, the structure will be raised
191500	193380	up a few feet.
193380	197320	This is a 30-day process, which can only happen over the three-month summer period when the
197320	201440	station can be reached by plane, meaning that in order to not shut down the facility during
201440	205840	its busiest period, the building was designed to be operational while it's lifted.
205840	210280	Therefore, its different components are connected by a number of flexible joints that can move
210280	212760	during the lifting process.
212760	217920	Of course, the actual purpose of the station is for research, but that poses the question,
217920	221840	what sort of research do you actually need to be at the South Pole for?
221840	225160	Well, as it turns out, quite a lot.
225160	227680	One of the top uses is for astronomy.
227680	232520	You see, in most places, water vapor in the air ever so slightly distorts the image from
232520	236420	telescopes, which for most types of astronomy isn't a problem, but when one is trying
236420	241960	to observe galaxies billions of light-years away, for example, precision is key.
241960	248560	In fact, the South Pole telescope itself has discovered truly countless far-away galaxies.
248560	253040	In addition, thanks to this clarity, it was a crucial component of the planet-wide network
253040	258400	of telescopes that created the first-ever direct image of a black hole in 2019.
258400	263080	Beyond that, the clean air of the pole allows for super-precise atmospheric research, and
263080	267400	the relatively low annual accumulation allows for climate research through studying ice
267400	268540	cores.
268540	273360	This is all to say, the South Pole station isn't just there for prestige—it's a
273360	279120	critical piece of scientific infrastructure supporting a huge variety of research.
279200	284400	However, most of the research itself isn't actually conducted there.
284400	288320	Given how expensive it is to travel to the pole, various institutions generally only
288320	292200	send a small number of people to the station to calibrate and maintain their scientific
292200	297140	equipment, while the data are sent back to their respective headquarters for analysis.
297140	301180	That means that, each summer, in that three-month window when flights can land, there's a
301180	306360	flurry of activity as personnel try to get all their work done before the season is over.
306600	311880	Then, over winter, only a skeleton crew remains to keep everything running.
311880	316580	Of course, given the absolute isolation that occurs over this period, the station staff
316580	318840	is very carefully selected.
318840	322640	Everyone is screened to assure that they're in near-perfect physical health, as conditions
322640	326580	that might be minor in the rest of the world can turn deadly given the station's lack
326580	331520	of advanced medical care, and they're also subject to extensive psychological evaluation.
331520	335560	This is primarily to assure that they can handle this severe degree of isolation, six
335560	340520	months of continuous darkness, and small work community for nine months as, if mental health
340520	345660	deteriorates over winter, there's truly no way out.
345660	349880	Over this period, there tends to only be a single doctor at the station, conducting their
349880	352700	work with somewhat limited medical facilities.
352700	356600	This doctor is subject to even more rigorous medical screening themselves, given their
356600	359800	importance to the health of everyone else at the facility.
359800	364000	In fact, some countries' Antarctic programs even require their doctors to have their appendix
364000	367580	removed to prevent the possibility of appendicitis.
367580	372300	Of course, a single doctor can't know everything, so for any advanced conditions that arise
372300	377020	with station staff, the facility is outfitted with advanced telemedicine equipment which
377020	381620	can transmit medical data in real time, so specialists in the US can attempt to diagnose
381620	384080	and treat a patient remotely.
384080	388860	Of course, in order to do that, they need internet, which is yet another challenge at
388860	390600	the South Pole.
390600	395400	Most non-polar, isolated research stations now are able to rely completely on commercial
395400	400040	satellite internet providers, but that's not entirely possible at the bottom of the
400040	401280	world.
401280	404720	Commercial satellite internet is only widespread where there's a market, and there's only
404720	407520	a market where there are lots of people.
407520	411740	That means that most telecommunications satellites are not positioned in an orbit that the South
411740	413920	Pole can reliably view.
413920	418520	Therefore, the station has to largely count on the NASA network of communications satellites
418520	420760	designed to link spacecraft to Earth.
420760	424880	In fact, this network is the very one the International Space Station uses for data
424880	426520	up and downlink.
426520	430840	Even this system, though, is only in view of the pole a few times per day.
430840	434740	On November 13th, 2020, for example, the South Pole could connect to one of its satellites
434740	442240	from 3.29 to 3.55 pm, 4.59 to 7.05 pm, and 8.09 to 9.27 pm, meaning they only had a connection
442240	445640	for three hours and fifty minutes that day.
445640	449340	These NASA satellites provide the bulk of the station's data connection, with an overall
449340	454280	capacity of 275 megabits per second, meaning they use these short passes to transmit the
454280	458200	bulk of the scientific data back to the outside world, and this is also the time when it's
458200	461280	possible for the station staff to use the internet themselves to connect with their
461280	463080	families or friends.
463080	466840	The station supplements this connection, though, with a daily four and a half hour pass by
466840	472120	a UK Ministry of Defense communications satellite, which provides a much leaner 1.54 megabits
472120	477280	per second data link, and a subsequent four-hour pass by a US military communications satellite,
477280	482360	which allows for 10 megabits per second of uplink and 30 megabits per second of downlink.
482360	486740	For the rest of the day, the station only has a very rudimentary 38 kilobits per second
486740	491320	data link through the Iridium satellite network, meaning, for all but the most urgent communications,
491320	494440	it's cut off from the world.
494440	499000	Beyond that, even just taking out the trash is difficult at the South Pole.
499000	503280	The station is required by international law to limit waste as much as possible, and this
503280	507280	means that nearly everything brought in is eventually brought out.
507280	511260	All trash and recycling is collected during the winter season, and flown back to the much
511260	513160	larger McMurdo station.
513160	517260	There, recycling is processed, while trash is grouped together and stored to be sent
517260	521300	all the way back to the US on the single annual resupply ship.
521300	526200	That means that any garbage will travel 8,000 miles or 13,000 kilometers over a period of
526200	530720	up to a year from a trash can at the South Pole station to a landfill in the US in order
530720	532500	to be disposed of.
532500	537880	The reason for this obsessiveness around cleanliness goes beyond environmental consciousness—it's
537880	540200	crucial to the science conducted there.
540200	544600	For example, there's a zone that stretches 98 miles or 150 kilometers northwest of the
544600	547920	station where no motor vehicles at all are allowed.
547920	552240	That's because this zone is upwind from the station's Atmospheric Research Station,
552240	556520	which is located there due to the pollutant-free air, and the exhaust of one snowmobile could
556520	560840	contaminate the air enough to throw off the observations, potentially complicating some
560840	561840	research.
561840	566860	Now, it's worth pointing out that this structure, the South Pole station, is the only thing
566860	571620	separating the staff of the facility from the deadly Antarctic environment, and, for
571620	576000	nine months a year, the facility is entirely unreachable.
576000	580080	Outside of the summer season, stretching from November to mid-February, the weather is simply
580080	585040	too harsh for planes to land with any degree of safety, so if this facility fails, there
585040	588460	is almost zero opportunity for evacuation.
588460	593080	To put this into perspective, if the International Space Station fails, for example, astronauts
593080	597800	can almost immediately load into the spacecraft they came in and return to earth.
597800	601840	At the South Pole, even if it were life or death, and even if a pilot was willing to
601840	605980	put their life on the line to get to the pole, there are stretches of weeks when the weather
605980	611460	makes it physically impossible to get a plane on the ground in one piece.
611460	616200	However, in very limited circumstances, when it becomes clear that someone has developed
616200	620140	a medical condition severe enough that they will not make it till summer, and when there's
620140	623860	a flight crew willing to put their lives on the line to save another's, the Antarctic
623860	627720	program has authorized attempts at evacuation.
627720	631000	This has only happened successfully three times.
631000	635380	Each of these flights was conducted by extremely experienced pilots from Ken Borick Air, a
635380	639140	Canadian airline accustomed to operating at the poles, in small, twin-order aircraft—one
639140	642400	of the only types that can withstand the Antarctic winter cold.
642400	645860	These aircraft had to be ferried down from Canada, and then landed and held short of
645860	649740	the continent for a number of days while waiting for a weather window to fly further south
649740	651060	to the pole.
651060	655160	Once that happened, though, they flew the final stretch and landed in darkness, quickly
655160	659280	picking up their patient before the aircraft froze, and then flew to South America to reach
659280	661020	an advanced hospital.
661020	665140	With these evacuations, it took more than a week to actually get an aircraft down to
665140	670540	the pole, so if something went catastrophically wrong that made the entire station uninhabitable,
670540	674940	like a fire, for example, there'd be little chance of getting everyone out in time.
674940	680200	That's why there's a smaller, self-sufficient, fireproof wing of the station designated as
680200	682180	an emergency lifeboat.
682180	686660	This has a kitchen, a small living area, a dedicated generator, a water treatment plant,
686660	690340	and it's designed to be able to keep the station staff alive through the winter until
690340	694420	an evacuation is possible, if the rest of the station fails.
694420	699220	All in all, the 45 or so people living at the South Pole over the winter have to be,
699220	704020	in the most true sense possible, self-sufficient, because there is almost no opportunity for
704020	709100	outside help, and that's exactly what makes it so dangerous.
709100	713320	This season, though, the potential for danger is escalated.
713320	718160	Right now, in November 2020, the South Pole is reconnecting to the world, for the first
718160	722020	time since February 14th, as its summer season gets started.
722020	727700	Now, the world has obviously changed a lot between February and November, but Antarctica
727700	729960	has pretty much stayed the same.
729960	734300	Up until now, COVID was not a threat to the continent, since it severed its link to the
734300	737060	world before the virus became widespread.
737060	742020	Antarctica is currently the only COVID-free continent, and it's crucial it stays that
742020	743020	way.
743020	747420	In the cramped facilities of the various spaces, social distancing is impossible, one case
747420	751720	can turn into a major outbreak very quickly, and there's really no ability for the intensive
751720	754400	care that severe cases require.
754400	759360	If the virus took hold in the Antarctic population, a winter season, with limited possibility
759360	764240	for evacuation, could become very difficult or impossible.
764240	769220	Therefore, all staff is now intensely tested and quarantined for at least two weeks before
769220	773080	flying to the continent, and the stations are implementing policies such as mask wearing
773080	775640	for the first time as an extra precaution.
775640	779760	Also, this season's activities have been scaled back to essentially the bare minimum
779760	783480	required to keep the science going, such as crucial maintenance and resupply, and so
783480	786880	almost all construction projects have been cancelled.
786880	792320	That means that McMurdo Station, for example, will have a peak population of just 450 compared
792320	794320	to 1,250 normally.
794320	799920	It's tough to understate how tough it is to live year-round at the South Pole, and
799920	803420	COVID is making it even more challenging.
803420	807440	Life at the bottom of the world is certainly an adventure, but it's one that requires
807440	812680	spending the vast majority of the year indoors, in a single building, with a small number
812680	813680	of people.
813680	816960	It's undoubtedly a sacrifice.
816960	821000	Most of those living and working there don't do so because it's fun, because for the
821000	827200	most part, it's not, but rather, they do so because they believe so deeply and fundamentally
827200	834360	that the science, even in the face of extreme adversity, is worth it.
834360	838200	Because Wendover Productions has grown into a more fully-fledged business over the years,
838200	842560	it's more important than ever that we present ourselves professionally.
842560	846720	In my opinion, a crucial component of that is making sure that the email addresses we
846720	851200	use to communicate with sponsors, interview subjects, and others are unique and professional,
851200	853720	so that's why I use Hover.
853720	858160	They helped me find our Wendover.Productions domain, which I purchased for a super-reasonable
858160	862520	price, then I was able to set up custom email addresses ending in "@Wendover.Productions
862520	864760	in quite literally 30 seconds."
864760	869800	Nowadays, having an email ending in Gmail or Yahoo or iCloud just doesn't cut it—it
869800	874680	just looks unprofessional—and through Hover, setting up a custom email at your domain really
874680	876580	isn't expensive at all.
876580	880440	Hover also lets you buy a custom domain, which you can use for your website, or you can set
880440	884120	up to forward to your YouTube channel, your LinkedIn account, your Twitter, really anything.
884120	889400	Thanks to their hundreds of domain extensions, you can go way beyond .com or .net and create
889400	892800	a super-unique domain like Wendover.Productions.
892800	897840	All in all, if you want a professional, unique email and domain, Hover is the place to get
897840	900600	it, and it's worth getting now before it's gone.
