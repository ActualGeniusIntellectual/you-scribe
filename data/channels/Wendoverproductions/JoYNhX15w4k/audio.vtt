Hello! I'm Sam, this is my channel, this is That Wikipedia List, and this is That Wikipedia List.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.280
September 3rd, 1967.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.360
Sweden decides to switch from left to right.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.800
Swedish motorists accustomed to left side of the road driving

00:16.800 --> 00:21.200
join the growing trend throughout Europe to cross over to right side traffic flow.

00:21.840 --> 00:23.920
That was a crazy day for Sweden.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.240
Prior to 1967, Sweden, much like many other European countries,

00:28.240 --> 00:29.520
drove on the left.

00:29.520 --> 00:33.440
Most countries in the world, in fact, began driving on the left because that's how carriages

00:33.440 --> 00:36.560
did it and carriages did it that way because that's how horses did it.

00:36.560 --> 00:39.280
The rules started in the first place because back in the old days,

00:39.280 --> 00:41.760
most would brandish their sword on their right side.

00:41.760 --> 00:46.560
So when riding, they wanted to be able to respond to an oncoming attacker on the right side.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.640
Archaeological evidence proves that left side riding was the norm throughout much of

00:50.640 --> 00:54.800
the ancient world. The shift to right side riding came when freight wagons got larger.

00:54.800 --> 01:00.080
As trade became more common, demand grew so teamsters, the old term for wagon drivers,

01:00.080 --> 01:03.920
started adding more and more horses to pull heavier and heavier loads.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.680
There weren't seats on these wagons so teamsters just sat on a horse.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.520
Most chose to sit on the back left horse so they could whip with their right hand

01:11.520 --> 01:15.920
since the vast majority of people, especially at the time, were right hand dominant.

01:15.920 --> 01:20.000
Therefore, the teamsters chose to ride on the right side of the road so that oncoming

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
wagons could pass on their left and they could clearly see that their wheels were clear.

01:24.640 --> 01:29.680
Fast forward 200 years and 65% of the world's population drives on the right side of the road,

01:29.680 --> 01:33.040
which, as it turns out, is the worst side to drive on.

01:33.040 --> 01:36.640
You see, humans are naturally right side dominant. As we know,

01:36.640 --> 01:40.320
the vast majority of the world's population is right handed—about 90%.

01:40.880 --> 01:44.080
But the vast majority of the world is also right eye dominant.

01:44.080 --> 01:47.520
Humans actually do have an eye that works better than the other.

01:47.520 --> 01:51.120
For about 70% of the world's population, that's the right eye.

01:51.200 --> 01:55.040
While driving on the left, the right eye will focus on oncoming traffic

01:55.040 --> 01:57.280
while the left will see what's passing by.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.760
This may contribute to the slightly lower accident rate in left side driving countries.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.640
Anyways, let's get back to Dagen H—the name for the day Sweden switched.

02:06.640 --> 02:11.280
In 1955, Sweden held a referendum on the issue of driving directionality

02:11.280 --> 02:15.280
and a staggering 83% voted against changing the direction.

02:15.280 --> 02:20.320
The national legislator known as the Riksdag promptly responded by deciding to make the change.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.000
The rationale was that every single one of Sweden's neighbors drove on the right,

02:24.000 --> 02:28.640
and most imported cars, which were the cheapest cars, were designed to be driven on the right.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.000
In the months leading up to Dagen H, every intersection was outfitted

02:32.000 --> 02:35.360
with an extra set of signals and signs wrapped in black plastic.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.880
8,000 buses were retrofitted with new doors on the right side,

02:38.880 --> 02:41.600
and the rest were sold to Pakistan and Kenya.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.800
New lines were painted on the roads, then covered in black tape.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.200
Milk cartons and underwear with the day's logo were sold in stores around the country.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.840
Contests were held for songs about the change, then finally, on September 3rd,

02:53.840 --> 03:00.560
1967, at 3pm, the law switched, and the entire country had won enormous traffic jam

03:00.560 --> 03:04.640
as drivers slowly inched across the white line to get to the new normal.

03:05.280 --> 03:10.400
No one died that day on Swedish roads. In fact, nobody died the day after as well.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.440
There were only 125 collisions compared to the average of 164.

03:15.440 --> 03:20.960
It seemed that the switch worked. However, by 1969, collision rates were back to normal.

03:20.960 --> 03:24.640
It turned out that the roads were only safer because drivers were more cautious

03:24.640 --> 03:28.560
as they learned the new traffic patterns. I'll end with an only somewhat related but

03:28.560 --> 03:32.960
interesting tidbit. The Geneva Conventions have a treaty that outlines international rules of

03:32.960 --> 03:37.200
the road, including the rule that traffic directionality must be uniform throughout

03:37.200 --> 03:42.080
the same country. The vast majority of countries follow this rule with no problem. However,

03:42.080 --> 03:47.200
the good old US of A holds the territory of the US Virgin Islands, where all drivers drive on the

03:47.200 --> 03:51.760
left, and therefore the US is technically in violation of the Geneva Conventions,

03:51.760 --> 03:56.640
which, as the no-longer-existent country of Yugoslavia knows, is kind of a big deal.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.200

04:09.920 --> 04:15.600
stops you from copying money here or watch an old video of mine on space law here. Lastly,

04:15.600 --> 04:19.840
I think it's worth mentioning that I've been putting out videos far less frequently recently.

04:19.840 --> 04:23.760
I work seasonally in outdoor recreation and summer is a really big time for that,

04:23.760 --> 04:27.440
so I just don't have as much video-making time. Once mid-August rolls along,

04:27.440 --> 04:32.640
I'll be back to releasing videos almost every week.
