Hello! I'm Sam, this is my channel, this is That Wikipedia List, and this is That Wikipedia List.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,280
September 3rd, 1967.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,360
Sweden decides to switch from left to right.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,800
Swedish motorists accustomed to left side of the road driving

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,200
join the growing trend throughout Europe to cross over to right side traffic flow.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,920
That was a crazy day for Sweden.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,240
Prior to 1967, Sweden, much like many other European countries,

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,520
drove on the left.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,440
Most countries in the world, in fact, began driving on the left because that's how carriages

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,560
did it and carriages did it that way because that's how horses did it.

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,280
The rules started in the first place because back in the old days,

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
most would brandish their sword on their right side.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,560
So when riding, they wanted to be able to respond to an oncoming attacker on the right side.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,640
Archaeological evidence proves that left side riding was the norm throughout much of

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,800
the ancient world. The shift to right side riding came when freight wagons got larger.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,080
As trade became more common, demand grew so teamsters, the old term for wagon drivers,

17
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,920
started adding more and more horses to pull heavier and heavier loads.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
There weren't seats on these wagons so teamsters just sat on a horse.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
Most chose to sit on the back left horse so they could whip with their right hand

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,920
since the vast majority of people, especially at the time, were right hand dominant.

21
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,000
Therefore, the teamsters chose to ride on the right side of the road so that oncoming

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
wagons could pass on their left and they could clearly see that their wheels were clear.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,680
Fast forward 200 years and 65% of the world's population drives on the right side of the road,

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,040
which, as it turns out, is the worst side to drive on.

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,640
You see, humans are naturally right side dominant. As we know,

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,320
the vast majority of the world's population is right handed—about 90%.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,080
But the vast majority of the world is also right eye dominant.

28
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,520
Humans actually do have an eye that works better than the other.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,120
For about 70% of the world's population, that's the right eye.

30
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,040
While driving on the left, the right eye will focus on oncoming traffic

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,280
while the left will see what's passing by.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,760
This may contribute to the slightly lower accident rate in left side driving countries.

33
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,640
Anyways, let's get back to Dagen H—the name for the day Sweden switched.

34
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,280
In 1955, Sweden held a referendum on the issue of driving directionality

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,280
and a staggering 83% voted against changing the direction.

36
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,320
The national legislator known as the Riksdag promptly responded by deciding to make the change.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,000
The rationale was that every single one of Sweden's neighbors drove on the right,

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,640
and most imported cars, which were the cheapest cars, were designed to be driven on the right.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,000
In the months leading up to Dagen H, every intersection was outfitted

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,360
with an extra set of signals and signs wrapped in black plastic.

41
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,880
8,000 buses were retrofitted with new doors on the right side,

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,600
and the rest were sold to Pakistan and Kenya.

43
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,800
New lines were painted on the roads, then covered in black tape.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,200
Milk cartons and underwear with the day's logo were sold in stores around the country.

45
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,840
Contests were held for songs about the change, then finally, on September 3rd,

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,560
1967, at 3pm, the law switched, and the entire country had won enormous traffic jam

47
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,640
as drivers slowly inched across the white line to get to the new normal.

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,400
No one died that day on Swedish roads. In fact, nobody died the day after as well.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,440
There were only 125 collisions compared to the average of 164.

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,960
It seemed that the switch worked. However, by 1969, collision rates were back to normal.

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,640
It turned out that the roads were only safer because drivers were more cautious

52
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
as they learned the new traffic patterns. I'll end with an only somewhat related but

53
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,960
interesting tidbit. The Geneva Conventions have a treaty that outlines international rules of

54
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:37,200
the road, including the rule that traffic directionality must be uniform throughout

55
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,080
the same country. The vast majority of countries follow this rule with no problem. However,

56
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,200
the good old US of A holds the territory of the US Virgin Islands, where all drivers drive on the

57
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,760
left, and therefore the US is technically in violation of the Geneva Conventions,

58
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,640
which, as the no-longer-existent country of Yugoslavia knows, is kind of a big deal.

62
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,600
stops you from copying money here or watch an old video of mine on space law here. Lastly,

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,840
I think it's worth mentioning that I've been putting out videos far less frequently recently.

64
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,760
I work seasonally in outdoor recreation and summer is a really big time for that,

65
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,440
so I just don't have as much video-making time. Once mid-August rolls along,

66
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,640
I'll be back to releasing videos almost every week.
