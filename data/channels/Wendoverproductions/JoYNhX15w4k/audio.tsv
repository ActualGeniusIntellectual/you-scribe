0	6480	Hello! I'm Sam, this is my channel, this is That Wikipedia List, and this is That Wikipedia List.
7040	9280	September 3rd, 1967.
10480	13360	Sweden decides to switch from left to right.
13360	16800	Swedish motorists accustomed to left side of the road driving
16800	21200	join the growing trend throughout Europe to cross over to right side traffic flow.
21840	23920	That was a crazy day for Sweden.
23920	28240	Prior to 1967, Sweden, much like many other European countries,
28240	29520	drove on the left.
29520	33440	Most countries in the world, in fact, began driving on the left because that's how carriages
33440	36560	did it and carriages did it that way because that's how horses did it.
36560	39280	The rules started in the first place because back in the old days,
39280	41760	most would brandish their sword on their right side.
41760	46560	So when riding, they wanted to be able to respond to an oncoming attacker on the right side.
46560	50640	Archaeological evidence proves that left side riding was the norm throughout much of
50640	54800	the ancient world. The shift to right side riding came when freight wagons got larger.
54800	60080	As trade became more common, demand grew so teamsters, the old term for wagon drivers,
60080	63920	started adding more and more horses to pull heavier and heavier loads.
63920	67680	There weren't seats on these wagons so teamsters just sat on a horse.
67680	71520	Most chose to sit on the back left horse so they could whip with their right hand
71520	75920	since the vast majority of people, especially at the time, were right hand dominant.
75920	80000	Therefore, the teamsters chose to ride on the right side of the road so that oncoming
80000	84000	wagons could pass on their left and they could clearly see that their wheels were clear.
84640	89680	Fast forward 200 years and 65% of the world's population drives on the right side of the road,
89680	93040	which, as it turns out, is the worst side to drive on.
93040	96640	You see, humans are naturally right side dominant. As we know,
96640	100320	the vast majority of the world's population is right handed—about 90%.
100880	104080	But the vast majority of the world is also right eye dominant.
104080	107520	Humans actually do have an eye that works better than the other.
107520	111120	For about 70% of the world's population, that's the right eye.
111200	115040	While driving on the left, the right eye will focus on oncoming traffic
115040	117280	while the left will see what's passing by.
117280	121760	This may contribute to the slightly lower accident rate in left side driving countries.
122480	126640	Anyways, let's get back to Dagen H—the name for the day Sweden switched.
126640	131280	In 1955, Sweden held a referendum on the issue of driving directionality
131280	135280	and a staggering 83% voted against changing the direction.
135280	140320	The national legislator known as the Riksdag promptly responded by deciding to make the change.
140320	144000	The rationale was that every single one of Sweden's neighbors drove on the right,
144000	148640	and most imported cars, which were the cheapest cars, were designed to be driven on the right.
148640	152000	In the months leading up to Dagen H, every intersection was outfitted
152000	155360	with an extra set of signals and signs wrapped in black plastic.
155360	158880	8,000 buses were retrofitted with new doors on the right side,
158880	161600	and the rest were sold to Pakistan and Kenya.
161600	164800	New lines were painted on the roads, then covered in black tape.
164800	169200	Milk cartons and underwear with the day's logo were sold in stores around the country.
169200	173840	Contests were held for songs about the change, then finally, on September 3rd,
173840	180560	1967, at 3pm, the law switched, and the entire country had won enormous traffic jam
180560	184640	as drivers slowly inched across the white line to get to the new normal.
185280	190400	No one died that day on Swedish roads. In fact, nobody died the day after as well.
190400	195440	There were only 125 collisions compared to the average of 164.
195440	200960	It seemed that the switch worked. However, by 1969, collision rates were back to normal.
200960	204640	It turned out that the roads were only safer because drivers were more cautious
204640	208560	as they learned the new traffic patterns. I'll end with an only somewhat related but
208560	212960	interesting tidbit. The Geneva Conventions have a treaty that outlines international rules of
212960	217200	the road, including the rule that traffic directionality must be uniform throughout
217200	222080	the same country. The vast majority of countries follow this rule with no problem. However,
222080	227200	the good old US of A holds the territory of the US Virgin Islands, where all drivers drive on the
227200	231760	left, and therefore the US is technically in violation of the Geneva Conventions,
231760	236640	which, as the no-longer-existent country of Yugoslavia knows, is kind of a big deal.
236640	241200	Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this video. Make sure to click subscribe to catch more episodes

249920	255600	stops you from copying money here or watch an old video of mine on space law here. Lastly,
255600	259840	I think it's worth mentioning that I've been putting out videos far less frequently recently.
259840	263760	I work seasonally in outdoor recreation and summer is a really big time for that,
263760	267440	so I just don't have as much video-making time. Once mid-August rolls along,
267440	272640	I'll be back to releasing videos almost every week.
