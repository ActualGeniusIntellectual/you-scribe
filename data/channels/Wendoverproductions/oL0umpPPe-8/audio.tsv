0	4200	Geographically speaking, South Korea should be poor.
4200	8960	Fractionally larger than the state of Indiana, South Korea isn't big, and unlike Indiana,
8960	11360	it's not agriculturally productive.
11360	17200	The nation is rugged and steep to the extent that only 22% of its land is actually arable.
17200	22000	Worse still, this rocky disposition doesn't make up for its agricultural shortcomings
22000	24800	through any sort of mineral wealth.
24920	30860	South Korea has coal, but not much, as it ranks 49th globally in proven reserves—far
30860	33320	behind even its dirt-poor neighbor to the north.
33320	37760	And perhaps most problematic is the fact that the country's 81st in the world in natural
37760	43360	gas reserves and is tied dead last in oil with none at all.
43360	46000	And all of these are only the domestic challenges.
46000	50400	Zoom out from the Rocky Peninsula and the region's a who's who of past and present
50400	52120	powerhouses.
52120	56800	Squeezed through history by empires around it and limited natural resources, South Korea
56800	57800	should be poor.
57800	60600	But it's not—it's rich.
60600	67000	By nominal GDP, South Korea has the 10th largest economy in the world—a fact that has much
67000	70920	to do with a single company.
70920	74480	Before there was a republic of Korea, and before there was a war to define the economic
74480	78920	doctrine of Korea, there was a grocery-trading shop in the southern city of Daegu that dealt
78920	82520	in fish and noodles and went by the name of Samsung.
82520	87000	While the shop's owner, Lee Byung-chui, couldn't have known it in 1938, his business
87000	91680	would soon serve as the backbone of one of the most dramatic economic transformations
91680	97760	of the 20th century—what economists would come to call the Miracle on the Han River.
97760	101560	Now, Miracle is a bit of a misnomer.
101560	107640	Ultimately, what took South Korean GDP from here to here, on 100-fold growth over 40 years,
107680	110400	was extraordinary but also explainable.
110400	116600	It was a function of successful long-term planning combining forces with savvy opportunists.
116600	121440	It was also, in part, a function of the fact that in 1950, South Korea nearly ceased to
121440	124000	exist at all.
124000	128400	By August of that year, South Korean forces had little land left to defend after the communist
128400	131520	north had taken all but this corner of the peninsula.
131520	135520	From a southern perspective, it was the bleakest point in the war.
135520	141800	But war, and South Korea's reversal of fortunes in the years that followed, created opportunity.
141800	145560	In the midst of the Korean War's wreckage, Lee pivoted.
145560	150220	In 1953, with leftover Japanese colonial assets selling for cents on the dollar, and much
150220	154440	of South Korea's already meager industrial infrastructure in ruin, Lee launched Choe
154440	159580	Jidang, a sugar refinery, then, in the year following, Choe Majik, a wool mill, both under
159580	163080	what could now be considered the Samsung Group.
163080	166820	For Lee, it was a logical progression, as South Koreans desperately needed everyday
166820	170640	products and food while South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, had begun funneling
170640	175200	international aid to allied industrialists in hopes of reducing reliance on imports.
175200	178960	Rhee's government funded the construction of facilities and the importation of raw sugar
178960	183720	for Lee's new projects and soon, with few to compete with in a war-torn nation and after
183720	189540	a few timely expansions, the Samsung Group became the nation's fourth largest borrower.
189540	194100	With cozy political connections and a stronghold over critical industry, the Samsung Group
194100	195100	took off.
195100	199100	In the years that followed, it acquired An Kook Fire and Marine Insurance and Cho Hung
199100	203380	Bank while also becoming a major shareholder in four other banks.
203380	207940	Less than a decade after acquiring that first sugar refinery, Samsung was the peninsula's
207940	213460	most powerful conglomerate, and Lee's net worth was estimated to represent 19% of all
213460	215460	South Korean wealth.
215460	218620	The company had burst into a massive success.
218620	222940	The problem was, while South Korea had distributed Western recovery funds and done away with
222940	227900	feudal land practices, South Koreans were still poor and the country was still overwhelmingly
227900	232660	agricultural and underdeveloped—issues that came to a head when the military overthrew
232660	235620	Rhee's government in 1961.
235620	240340	South Korea's economic rise began under a new leader—Park Chung-hee.
240340	244500	With a laser-like focus on expanding industrial exports and maximizing South Korea's human
244500	250580	capital, GDP growth shot skyward, only dipping under 9% annually on three occasions from
250580	253540	1963 to 1978.
253540	256620	Driving this growth more than anything were the conglomerates.
256620	260380	While Park had publicly stated plans of crushing Korean monopolies that rose through shady
260380	265180	dealings in the post-war period during his rise to power, his presidency took a different
265180	266380	approach.
266380	270340	Rather than breaking the conglomerates up, he assigned them the exportation era's most
270340	275160	critical task—getting Korean-made goods to the wider world.
275160	279220	With the government providing cheap steel, a plethora of subsidies, lenient loans, and
279220	284020	tax breaks to major manufacturers, the likes of Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and SK Group did
284020	288460	just that, expanding vertically and horizontally.
288460	293800	These family-controlled, government-aided corporate groups came to be known as Chapels—a
293800	298620	term that entered common Korean parlance during the 60s and 70s as the institutions grew.
298620	304220	In the 70s and 80s, Chapels dominated, pulling the South Korean economy up as they pushed
304220	306380	their products out to the world.
306380	310820	Samsung launched TVs, then semiconductors, then mobile phones for export.
310820	315140	Hyundai sold cars on the international market, and LG opened up a factory in Huntsville,
315140	316140	Alabama.
316140	320220	Though South Korean citizens came to argue over the role of Chapels in politics and society,
320220	325180	what wasn't up for debate was the remarkably positive impacts they had on everyday standards
325180	326180	of life.
326460	331380	Life expectancy doubled from 1950 to 1990, while infant mortality cratered to less than
331380	334060	a tenth of what it was at the war's end.
334060	338080	All the while, Chapels showed no sign of slowing.
338080	342600	Through the turn of the century, South Korea's GDP continued to grow, and even with the death
342600	347920	of Yibongchui in 1987, Samsung continued to expand globally and dominate domestically
347920	351420	under the guidance of his son, Yikong He.
351460	357060	Today, just seven decades on from the company's prescient pivot, South Korea is Samsung, and
357060	359220	Samsung is South Korea.
359220	363460	For the average resident, it's a relationship with a corporation as deep as that with the
363460	369380	government itself, perhaps best demonstrated through a single, eye-popping statistic.
369380	376040	Year after year, just about 20% of the entire nation's GDP is made up of Samsung Group
376040	377340	revenue.
377340	381480	The only single entity that can rival that is the South Korean government, whose spending
381480	385360	typically makes up 20-25% of GDP.
385360	390020	This staggering degree of economic concentration makes even the most extreme examples in the
390020	391860	rest of the world appear routine.
391860	397700	Japan's biggest company, Toyota, accounts for about 5% of GDP, while the US's, Walmart,
397700	400060	sits at just 2.5%.
400060	404900	An entire fifth of an economy being attributed to a single company, especially a single company
404900	410020	controlled by a single family in a major, advanced, diversified economy is absolutely
410020	413860	unparalleled, even at a global scale.
413860	418680	Undoubtedly, this exceptional centrality permeates into everyday life.
418680	422580	Young people, and especially their parents, tend to fixate on the singular path towards
422580	425300	becoming the so-called Samsung Man.
425300	429460	It's considered the pinnacle of success to have passed all the academic and social
429460	434060	hurdles necessary to be deemed worthy to work at the country's largest company, and therefore
434220	438760	this idealistic vision is encapsulated across South Korean society.
438760	442740	Characters in pursuit of a position of the company even borders on cliché as a plot
442740	445300	point in the country's film and television.
445300	449100	Just as American youth might fixate on moving to LA to make it into Hollywood or living
449100	454020	in New York to break into big business, Korean kids prepare their entire childhood to apply
454020	459220	for the opportunity to pack into testing centers along with 100,000 others to take the bi-annual
459220	464620	Samsung Aptitude Test, hoping to score high enough to get recruiters' attention.
464620	468420	Hundreds of thousands won't even be allowed to take the test, then all but a few thousand
468420	472820	won't advance past it, leaving legions of disappointed youth who move on to the next
472820	477660	layer in the social hierarchy of careers, working for the smaller, lesser chables like
477660	479620	Hyundai or LG.
479620	483580	For those that don't succeed there, they move on to the country's small and medium-sized
483580	487580	employers—a fact they will try to hide from extended family and friends due to its
487580	490740	characterization as failure.
490740	495920	This centrality of focus can perhaps be attributed partially to the extent that Samsung has permeated
495920	497500	into South Korean life.
497500	501300	When you buy a smartphone in South Korea, you buy it from Samsung.
501300	504980	When you need life insurance in South Korea, you purchase a policy with Samsung.
504980	509220	When you take the ferry in South Korea, you step onto a ship built by Samsung.
509220	514800	When you go to the theme park in South Korea, you once again pay your money to Samsung.
514800	519280	This convoluted, seemingly scattershot structure of the conglomerate is reflective of the way
519280	524160	that Samsung has followed and captured opportunity wherever it exists through history, and has
524160	528280	actually been a critical factor in the Yi family's continued grip on power.
528280	533520	Today, there are 59 major Samsung affiliate companies, although, like many aspects of
533520	538560	Samsung's ownership structure, this is a soft, subjective definition, as so much of
538560	542200	the way in which controls held across the empire is soft and subjective.
542600	547020	But let's say there were just two affiliates—one of which wholly owned by the Yi family, one
547020	553080	of which wholly owned by outside investors—both worth $50 million, respectively.
553080	557740	Now, most major business decisions are settled with a simple majority, meaning to approve
557740	562580	a budget for the next year, for example, just 50% worth of shareholders plus one needs to
562580	563580	vote affirmatively.
563580	569560	So that's to say, 49.9% of the Yi family ownership in the first affiliate is effectively
569560	573680	worthless from a control perspective, at least for most decisions.
573680	579760	So what they could do is sell that 49.9%, buy 49.9% of the other affiliate, then use
579760	584680	a tiny bit of extra cash to get up to 50% plus one ownership of both affiliates.
584680	589440	It's essentially the same amount of money invested, but two companies under Yi family
589440	591660	control instead of one.
591660	595560	But now using their control of both of these companies, they could instruct each to use
595560	600460	annual operating profit to buy up 50% plus one ownership in a third affiliate, rather
600460	603640	than paying it back to themselves and the other owners, which would be subject to income
603640	607760	tax, and while they wouldn't directly own the third affiliate, they would control it
607760	612040	because they control the first two affiliates, which control the third.
612040	616940	And even then, while 50% plus one ownership is technically needed for control, in practice
616940	622320	it's often overkill as it only becomes relevant in a case of complete dissent by every other
622320	626520	investor, which is rare, especially when one has generated the degree of cult of personality
626520	628440	that the Yi family has.
628440	633460	So the Yi family might only need 30 or 40% direct or indirect control of a given affiliate
633460	638980	if another 10 or 20% is owned by trustworthy, allied, outside investors.
638980	644360	Through the decades, these and other systems have compounded to create this—a scattered,
644360	648520	convoluted web of ownership that can confuse even the savviest financial analysts, but
648520	652240	ultimately result in what matters to the Yi family most.
652280	655120	They need control of the entire empire.
655120	661520	But these structures are tenuous, especially when someone dies.
661520	666660	South Korea has one of the highest inheritance taxes in the world—50%.
666660	670360	That means that 50% of the value of assets goes to the government when they're passed
670360	672400	from one generation to the next.
672400	678020	Therefore, if Lee Kong-hee, for example, passed $5 billion in shares to his son, Lee Jae-yong,
678020	681960	the heir would have to find some $2.5 billion to pay the government, which he likely could
682000	688720	only do by selling $2.5 billion worth of shares—therefore losing the voting power that they bestow.
688720	695000	This hypothetical started to feel far more concrete in May of 2014 due to this—the
695000	698280	heart attack of Lee Kong-hee.
698280	701320	The chairman survived, but only barely.
701320	706240	As he sat comatose in a hospital bed at the Samsung Medical Center for days, weeks, months,
706240	710600	and eventually years, his children were thrown into a power struggle as they used the time
710600	715400	to craft a plan that would keep Samsung in family control after paying inheritance taxes
715400	719860	upon their father's inevitable and seemingly impending death.
719860	725840	This was difficult, the numbers were tough, and so it required some creativity—perhaps
725840	726840	too much.
726840	731040	Two of the most critical links in the e-family ownership web were Samsung Construction and
731040	736600	Trading, or CNT, and Choi Industries—each of which, as two of the oldest Samsung affiliates,
736600	739840	acted primarily as de facto holding companies of sorts.
740080	744280	But e-family control of CNT, and therefore electronics, engineering, chemicals, and the
744280	749800	other affiliates partially owned by CNT, was fading as outside, increasingly hostile investors
749800	751880	continued to buy in.
751880	757400	If Lee Kong-hee never awoke from his coma, the 50% inheritance tax would be a death blow,
757400	759800	and the house of cards would crumble.
759800	762080	Therefore, a plan.
762080	765700	They'd merge CNT and Choi.
765700	769480	While quantifying their control of each is difficult due to the extent of their soft,
769480	773760	informal control, what's important to note is that e-control of Choi was much stronger
773760	778580	than that of CNT, so what would make the restructuring productive for them would be if it overvalued
778580	784020	Choi and undervalued CNT so that post-merger, they'd effectively end up with more relative
784020	788780	control over the new combined de facto holding company, and therefore more control over the
788780	793380	entire empire without having spent a cent.
793380	797280	So they proposed exactly that—an objectively bad deal.
797280	801040	One CNT share would convert to 0.35 Choi shares.
801040	805960	CNT shareholders, and specifically its largest, American hedge fund Elliott, started campaigning
805960	810640	against the merger, arguing that Choi was objectively worth about $3.42 billion, but
810640	817560	a merger ratio of 0.35 inflated its value to $4.08 billion, effectively gifting hundreds
817560	823240	of millions of dollars in value to the ease straight from the pockets of CNT shareholders.
823240	829200	It was an unbelievably good deal for the family, but they couldn't do it alone.
829200	832820	Unlike most business decisions, which the e-family could directly control through their
832820	838180	de facto simple majority, mergers and acquisitions require supermajority approval of two-thirds
838180	839180	of shareholders.
839180	843040	They could get most of the way there themselves, but to push it over the edge, they needed
843040	847760	to convince CNT shareholders to vote against their own interests.
847760	850480	But there was one whale.
850480	856000	The single largest outside shareholder, with 11.6% of ownership, was the South Korean National
856000	859800	Pension Service, which was run by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which was run by the
859800	863760	South Korean government, which at the time was run by President Park Geun-hye.
863760	870420	That's to say, if they could get to President Park, she might be able to get to the pension
870420	871600	service.
871600	877240	Conveniently, they had a backdoor—long-time Park confidant and daughter of an influential
877240	879000	cult leader Choi Sun-si.
879520	883880	It was an open secret among South Korea's power brokers that Choi, despite holding no
883880	888080	official position in Park's government, exerted deep influence over the President's
888080	892280	decision-making—even to the extent of picking out outfits, editing speeches, and making
892280	895040	specific policy propositions.
895040	899160	On the surface, Choi worked as the owner of an Italian restaurant in Seoul's Ritsi Gangam
899160	903640	neighborhood, but politicians and businesspeople were often seen walking up to the third floor,
903640	908400	to her office, where she solicited donations for two nonprofits she had set up—the Mir
908440	912480	and K Sports Foundations, supposedly dealing with cultural exchanges and sports-related
912480	917880	projects, but in practice acting as the top of the funnel in a complex, globe-spanning,
917880	919240	money laundering scheme.
919240	921440	Samsung, at the direction of E.J.
921440	927000	Young, donated a combined $36 million to Choi's foundations, and while still little is known
927000	932520	about the specific inner workings, soon after, the state pension fund voted in favor of C&T
932520	937040	and Choi's merger, the measure passed, the two companies combined, and the E family shored
937040	940320	up control of the Samsung empire into the next generation.
940320	944640	Of course, we now know about this.
944640	948640	We know how Park influenced the pension fund, we know how Choi influenced Park, and we know
948640	949640	how E.J.
949640	950920	Young influenced Choi.
950920	956560	Clearly, the secret was built, a massive scandal erupted, Park was impeached and jailed, E.J.
956560	961960	Young was indicted and jailed, but today, everything's pretty much back to normal.
961960	966520	Park was pardoned and freed in 2021, then one year later, so too was E.J.
966520	972760	Young, and as of October 27th, 2022, following the death of his father in 2020 after years
972760	974400	in that hospital bed, E.J.
974400	978640	Young was appointed chairman of the Samsung group.
978640	980680	Social order was returned.
980680	984800	The E family power was maintained.
984800	987000	This is a familiar refrain.
987720	988720	In fact, E.J.
988720	992440	Young's legal troubles are practically a mirror image of his father's from a decade
992440	993440	before.
993440	998120	Lee Kun-hee was sentenced to three years in jail in 2008 for, among other things, bribery,
998120	1002200	but only one year later was pardoned by the President so that he could remain on the International
1002200	1006080	Olympic Committee and shepherd South Korea's bid for the 2018 Games through.
1006080	1010160	While that was the publicly stated reason, Lee Kun-hee was later revealed to have used
1010160	1014680	bribery to convince the President to pardon him for his bribery charges.
1014680	1018520	Later justifications were used in summer 2022 with the pardon of E.J.
1018520	1019520	Young.
1019520	1023380	Samsung, South Korean business groups, and even the US Chamber of Commerce had been lobbying
1023380	1028720	for years for a pardon, and while on parole, Lee still acted as de facto leader of Samsung,
1028720	1032060	even meeting with President Biden in May 2022.
1032060	1036280	So two months on, President Jung-seok Yoy justified Lee's pardon in a straightforward
1036280	1041180	manner, saying that, as the only realistic family heir to the Samsung chairmanship, his
1041180	1045580	leadership was necessary to guide the country's largest company as both recovered from the
1045580	1047620	COVID-19 pandemic.
1047620	1050660	This justification isn't that far-fetched.
1050660	1055180	While undoubtedly unfair, considering the sheer degree of economic influence Samsung
1055180	1058920	has on South Korea, it might be pragmatic.
1058920	1061660	The ends might genuinely justify the means.
1061660	1066140	But it does perpetuate the cycle that seemingly cannot be broken.
1066400	1072260	South Korea, and especially South Korean politicians, cannot survive without Samsung.
1072260	1075780	But to an extent, Samsung can survive without South Korea.
1075780	1081660	It can always restructure, relocate, and refocus away from the nation in the long term.
1081660	1086620	This power structure of enterprise above nation is inherent to a situation where such a large
1086620	1092020	company exists in such a small country, but it's hard to believe it's tenable.
1092020	1096300	Companies can't run countries, and public dissent towards Samsung is growing in younger
1096300	1100340	generations, lacking the sympathy borne from viewing the company's integral role in the
1100340	1104820	nation's ascent, are increasingly fighting back against the cronyism and corruption.
1104820	1109340	It's tough to know which house of cards will crumble first.
1109340	1113220	Will it be the convoluted ownership structure that keeps the Lee family in control, or will
1113220	1117860	it be the tenuous power balance between Samsung and South Korea, knocked down by the very
1117860	1122500	people that make up the entirety of both venerable institutions?
1122500	1127460	For those of you that have demonstrated that you like this type of video by staying till
1127460	1132460	the end, I have some suggestions on what to watch next that I'm sure you'll like.
1132460	1136700	First I'd start with Polymatter's excellent series China Actually, which demystifies how
1136700	1140820	one of the world's most consequential countries really works by answering questions like why
1140820	1145540	China won't abandon its zero-COVID policies, and how the nation manages to survive without
1145540	1148820	essentially any major international allies.
1148820	1152340	Then I'd watch the episode of RealLifeLore's series Modern Conflicts on the Korean conflict
1152340	1156620	in the 21st century—it provides amazing insight into what's kept the tenuous peace,
1156620	1160700	and how that could crumble and threaten major multinationals like Samsung.
1160700	1165140	Both of these series, and far, far more, are exclusive to Nebula, which is no surprise
1165140	1169980	considering Polymatter, RealLifeLore, myself, and loads of other creators teamed up, founded
1169980	1175120	Nebula, and designed it from the ground floor to be the best home to the stuff we make.
1175700	1179140	Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have believed that enough to sign up so far, but to explain
1179140	1182960	to those of you who haven't, the idea behind Nebula was to remove many of the perverse
1182960	1187540	incentives that compromises video quality on ad-supported platforms like YouTube.
1187540	1192060	By putting it behind a paywall, we're incentivized as creators to make the absolute best videos
1192060	1195260	that will keep you all subscribed, rather than incentivized to just make the videos
1195260	1197580	that will make you click and zone out.
1197580	1201280	We use these subscription fees to pay to run the service, to provide ongoing revenue to
1201280	1205060	Nebula creators, and to fund our big-budget Nebula originals, which allows creators to
1205060	1209540	pursue their big, ambitious passion projects, which has led to some really good stuff, including
1209540	1212480	all of these made by the Wendover team.
1212480	1215680	Of course, even while being a good deal for the creators, we also want it to be a good
1215680	1220320	deal for you all, our audience, and it really is thanks to our partnership with CuriosityStream.
1220320	1225300	You see, they're an entirely different streaming service with a huge catalog of non-fiction
1225300	1229360	shows and documentaries like David Attenborough's Light on the Earth about the amazing world
1229360	1230840	of bioluminescent animals.
1230840	1235120	They're running a deal where by subscribing to any of their memberships at CuriosityStream.com
1235120	1239640	slash Wendover, they'll give you a Nebula subscription for free for as long as you stay
1239640	1240640	subscribed.
1240640	1244240	They've even discounted their annual plan to under $15 a year, which means you get two
1244240	1247620	streaming sites, both of which have great stuff that you'll actually watch, for less
1247620	1251280	than you'd probably pay for a month of one of the big streamers, and even while doing
1251280	1254800	that, you'll be helping support hundreds of independent creators that you probably
1254800	1255800	already watch.
1256240	1259920	So click the button on screen or head over to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover to sign
1259920	1262920	up, and thanks in advance for your support.
