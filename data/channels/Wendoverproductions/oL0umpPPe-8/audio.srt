1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Geographically speaking, South Korea should be poor.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,960
Fractionally larger than the state of Indiana, South Korea isn't big, and unlike Indiana,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,360
it's not agriculturally productive.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,200
The nation is rugged and steep to the extent that only 22% of its land is actually arable.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Worse still, this rocky disposition doesn't make up for its agricultural shortcomings

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,800
through any sort of mineral wealth.

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,860
South Korea has coal, but not much, as it ranks 49th globally in proven reserves—far

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:33,320
behind even its dirt-poor neighbor to the north.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,760
And perhaps most problematic is the fact that the country's 81st in the world in natural

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,360
gas reserves and is tied dead last in oil with none at all.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,000
And all of these are only the domestic challenges.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Zoom out from the Rocky Peninsula and the region's a who's who of past and present

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,120
powerhouses.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,800
Squeezed through history by empires around it and limited natural resources, South Korea

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
should be poor.

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,600
But it's not—it's rich.

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,000
By nominal GDP, South Korea has the 10th largest economy in the world—a fact that has much

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,920
to do with a single company.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,480
Before there was a republic of Korea, and before there was a war to define the economic

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,920
doctrine of Korea, there was a grocery-trading shop in the southern city of Daegu that dealt

21
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,520
in fish and noodles and went by the name of Samsung.

22
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,000
While the shop's owner, Lee Byung-chui, couldn't have known it in 1938, his business

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,680
would soon serve as the backbone of one of the most dramatic economic transformations

24
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,760
of the 20th century—what economists would come to call the Miracle on the Han River.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,560
Now, Miracle is a bit of a misnomer.

26
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,640
Ultimately, what took South Korean GDP from here to here, on 100-fold growth over 40 years,

27
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,400
was extraordinary but also explainable.

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,600
It was a function of successful long-term planning combining forces with savvy opportunists.

29
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,440
It was also, in part, a function of the fact that in 1950, South Korea nearly ceased to

30
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,000
exist at all.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,400
By August of that year, South Korean forces had little land left to defend after the communist

32
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,520
north had taken all but this corner of the peninsula.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
From a southern perspective, it was the bleakest point in the war.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,800
But war, and South Korea's reversal of fortunes in the years that followed, created opportunity.

35
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,560
In the midst of the Korean War's wreckage, Lee pivoted.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,220
In 1953, with leftover Japanese colonial assets selling for cents on the dollar, and much

37
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,440
of South Korea's already meager industrial infrastructure in ruin, Lee launched Choe

38
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,580
Jidang, a sugar refinery, then, in the year following, Choe Majik, a wool mill, both under

39
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,080
what could now be considered the Samsung Group.

40
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,820
For Lee, it was a logical progression, as South Koreans desperately needed everyday

41
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:50,640
products and food while South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, had begun funneling

42
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
international aid to allied industrialists in hopes of reducing reliance on imports.

43
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,960
Rhee's government funded the construction of facilities and the importation of raw sugar

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,720
for Lee's new projects and soon, with few to compete with in a war-torn nation and after

45
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,540
a few timely expansions, the Samsung Group became the nation's fourth largest borrower.

46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,100
With cozy political connections and a stronghold over critical industry, the Samsung Group

47
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
took off.

48
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,100
In the years that followed, it acquired An Kook Fire and Marine Insurance and Cho Hung

49
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,380
Bank while also becoming a major shareholder in four other banks.

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,940
Less than a decade after acquiring that first sugar refinery, Samsung was the peninsula's

51
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,460
most powerful conglomerate, and Lee's net worth was estimated to represent 19% of all

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,460
South Korean wealth.

53
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,620
The company had burst into a massive success.

54
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,940
The problem was, while South Korea had distributed Western recovery funds and done away with

55
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,900
feudal land practices, South Koreans were still poor and the country was still overwhelmingly

56
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,660
agricultural and underdeveloped—issues that came to a head when the military overthrew

57
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,620
Rhee's government in 1961.

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,340
South Korea's economic rise began under a new leader—Park Chung-hee.

59
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,500
With a laser-like focus on expanding industrial exports and maximizing South Korea's human

60
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,580
capital, GDP growth shot skyward, only dipping under 9% annually on three occasions from

61
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,540
1963 to 1978.

62
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,620
Driving this growth more than anything were the conglomerates.

63
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,380
While Park had publicly stated plans of crushing Korean monopolies that rose through shady

64
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,180
dealings in the post-war period during his rise to power, his presidency took a different

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,380
approach.

66
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,340
Rather than breaking the conglomerates up, he assigned them the exportation era's most

67
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,160
critical task—getting Korean-made goods to the wider world.

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,220
With the government providing cheap steel, a plethora of subsidies, lenient loans, and

69
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,020
tax breaks to major manufacturers, the likes of Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and SK Group did

70
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,460
just that, expanding vertically and horizontally.

71
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,800
These family-controlled, government-aided corporate groups came to be known as Chapels—a

72
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,620
term that entered common Korean parlance during the 60s and 70s as the institutions grew.

73
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,220
In the 70s and 80s, Chapels dominated, pulling the South Korean economy up as they pushed

74
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,380
their products out to the world.

75
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,820
Samsung launched TVs, then semiconductors, then mobile phones for export.

76
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,140
Hyundai sold cars on the international market, and LG opened up a factory in Huntsville,

77
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Alabama.

78
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,220
Though South Korean citizens came to argue over the role of Chapels in politics and society,

79
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,180
what wasn't up for debate was the remarkably positive impacts they had on everyday standards

80
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,180
of life.

81
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,380
Life expectancy doubled from 1950 to 1990, while infant mortality cratered to less than

82
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,060
a tenth of what it was at the war's end.

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:38,080
All the while, Chapels showed no sign of slowing.

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,600
Through the turn of the century, South Korea's GDP continued to grow, and even with the death

85
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,920
of Yibongchui in 1987, Samsung continued to expand globally and dominate domestically

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,420
under the guidance of his son, Yikong He.

87
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:57,060
Today, just seven decades on from the company's prescient pivot, South Korea is Samsung, and

88
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,220
Samsung is South Korea.

89
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,460
For the average resident, it's a relationship with a corporation as deep as that with the

90
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,380
government itself, perhaps best demonstrated through a single, eye-popping statistic.

91
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:16,040
Year after year, just about 20% of the entire nation's GDP is made up of Samsung Group

92
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,340
revenue.

93
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,480
The only single entity that can rival that is the South Korean government, whose spending

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,360
typically makes up 20-25% of GDP.

95
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,020
This staggering degree of economic concentration makes even the most extreme examples in the

96
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,860
rest of the world appear routine.

97
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,700
Japan's biggest company, Toyota, accounts for about 5% of GDP, while the US's, Walmart,

98
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,060
sits at just 2.5%.

99
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,900
An entire fifth of an economy being attributed to a single company, especially a single company

100
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,020
controlled by a single family in a major, advanced, diversified economy is absolutely

101
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,860
unparalleled, even at a global scale.

102
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,680
Undoubtedly, this exceptional centrality permeates into everyday life.

103
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,580
Young people, and especially their parents, tend to fixate on the singular path towards

104
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,300
becoming the so-called Samsung Man.

105
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,460
It's considered the pinnacle of success to have passed all the academic and social

106
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,060
hurdles necessary to be deemed worthy to work at the country's largest company, and therefore

107
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,760
this idealistic vision is encapsulated across South Korean society.

108
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,740
Characters in pursuit of a position of the company even borders on cliché as a plot

109
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,300
point in the country's film and television.

110
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,100
Just as American youth might fixate on moving to LA to make it into Hollywood or living

111
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,020
in New York to break into big business, Korean kids prepare their entire childhood to apply

112
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,220
for the opportunity to pack into testing centers along with 100,000 others to take the bi-annual

113
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,620
Samsung Aptitude Test, hoping to score high enough to get recruiters' attention.

114
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,420
Hundreds of thousands won't even be allowed to take the test, then all but a few thousand

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,820
won't advance past it, leaving legions of disappointed youth who move on to the next

116
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,660
layer in the social hierarchy of careers, working for the smaller, lesser chables like

117
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,620
Hyundai or LG.

118
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,580
For those that don't succeed there, they move on to the country's small and medium-sized

119
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,580
employers—a fact they will try to hide from extended family and friends due to its

120
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,740
characterization as failure.

121
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,920
This centrality of focus can perhaps be attributed partially to the extent that Samsung has permeated

122
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,500
into South Korean life.

123
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,300
When you buy a smartphone in South Korea, you buy it from Samsung.

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,980
When you need life insurance in South Korea, you purchase a policy with Samsung.

125
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,220
When you take the ferry in South Korea, you step onto a ship built by Samsung.

126
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,800
When you go to the theme park in South Korea, you once again pay your money to Samsung.

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,280
This convoluted, seemingly scattershot structure of the conglomerate is reflective of the way

128
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,160
that Samsung has followed and captured opportunity wherever it exists through history, and has

129
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,280
actually been a critical factor in the Yi family's continued grip on power.

130
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:53,520
Today, there are 59 major Samsung affiliate companies, although, like many aspects of

131
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,560
Samsung's ownership structure, this is a soft, subjective definition, as so much of

132
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,200
the way in which controls held across the empire is soft and subjective.

133
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,020
But let's say there were just two affiliates—one of which wholly owned by the Yi family, one

134
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,080
of which wholly owned by outside investors—both worth $50 million, respectively.

135
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,740
Now, most major business decisions are settled with a simple majority, meaning to approve

136
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,580
a budget for the next year, for example, just 50% worth of shareholders plus one needs to

137
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
vote affirmatively.

138
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,560
So that's to say, 49.9% of the Yi family ownership in the first affiliate is effectively

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,680
worthless from a control perspective, at least for most decisions.

140
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,760
So what they could do is sell that 49.9%, buy 49.9% of the other affiliate, then use

141
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,680
a tiny bit of extra cash to get up to 50% plus one ownership of both affiliates.

142
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,440
It's essentially the same amount of money invested, but two companies under Yi family

143
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,660
control instead of one.

144
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,560
But now using their control of both of these companies, they could instruct each to use

145
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,460
annual operating profit to buy up 50% plus one ownership in a third affiliate, rather

146
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,640
than paying it back to themselves and the other owners, which would be subject to income

147
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,760
tax, and while they wouldn't directly own the third affiliate, they would control it

148
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,040
because they control the first two affiliates, which control the third.

149
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,940
And even then, while 50% plus one ownership is technically needed for control, in practice

150
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,320
it's often overkill as it only becomes relevant in a case of complete dissent by every other

151
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,520
investor, which is rare, especially when one has generated the degree of cult of personality

152
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,440
that the Yi family has.

153
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,460
So the Yi family might only need 30 or 40% direct or indirect control of a given affiliate

154
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:38,980
if another 10 or 20% is owned by trustworthy, allied, outside investors.

155
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:44,360
Through the decades, these and other systems have compounded to create this—a scattered,

156
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,520
convoluted web of ownership that can confuse even the savviest financial analysts, but

157
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,240
ultimately result in what matters to the Yi family most.

158
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,120
They need control of the entire empire.

159
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,520
But these structures are tenuous, especially when someone dies.

160
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,660
South Korea has one of the highest inheritance taxes in the world—50%.

161
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,360
That means that 50% of the value of assets goes to the government when they're passed

162
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,400
from one generation to the next.

163
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,020
Therefore, if Lee Kong-hee, for example, passed $5 billion in shares to his son, Lee Jae-yong,

164
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,960
the heir would have to find some $2.5 billion to pay the government, which he likely could

165
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,720
only do by selling $2.5 billion worth of shares—therefore losing the voting power that they bestow.

166
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,000
This hypothetical started to feel far more concrete in May of 2014 due to this—the

167
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,280
heart attack of Lee Kong-hee.

168
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,320
The chairman survived, but only barely.

169
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,240
As he sat comatose in a hospital bed at the Samsung Medical Center for days, weeks, months,

170
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,600
and eventually years, his children were thrown into a power struggle as they used the time

171
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,400
to craft a plan that would keep Samsung in family control after paying inheritance taxes

172
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,860
upon their father's inevitable and seemingly impending death.

173
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,840
This was difficult, the numbers were tough, and so it required some creativity—perhaps

174
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
too much.

175
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,040
Two of the most critical links in the e-family ownership web were Samsung Construction and

176
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,600
Trading, or CNT, and Choi Industries—each of which, as two of the oldest Samsung affiliates,

177
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,840
acted primarily as de facto holding companies of sorts.

178
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,280
But e-family control of CNT, and therefore electronics, engineering, chemicals, and the

179
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,800
other affiliates partially owned by CNT, was fading as outside, increasingly hostile investors

180
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,880
continued to buy in.

181
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,400
If Lee Kong-hee never awoke from his coma, the 50% inheritance tax would be a death blow,

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,800
and the house of cards would crumble.

183
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,080
Therefore, a plan.

184
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,700
They'd merge CNT and Choi.

185
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,480
While quantifying their control of each is difficult due to the extent of their soft,

186
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,760
informal control, what's important to note is that e-control of Choi was much stronger

187
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,580
than that of CNT, so what would make the restructuring productive for them would be if it overvalued

188
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:04,020
Choi and undervalued CNT so that post-merger, they'd effectively end up with more relative

189
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,780
control over the new combined de facto holding company, and therefore more control over the

190
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,380
entire empire without having spent a cent.

191
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,280
So they proposed exactly that—an objectively bad deal.

192
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,040
One CNT share would convert to 0.35 Choi shares.

193
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,960
CNT shareholders, and specifically its largest, American hedge fund Elliott, started campaigning

194
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:30,640
against the merger, arguing that Choi was objectively worth about $3.42 billion, but

195
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,560
a merger ratio of 0.35 inflated its value to $4.08 billion, effectively gifting hundreds

196
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,240
of millions of dollars in value to the ease straight from the pockets of CNT shareholders.

197
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,200
It was an unbelievably good deal for the family, but they couldn't do it alone.

198
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,820
Unlike most business decisions, which the e-family could directly control through their

199
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:58,180
de facto simple majority, mergers and acquisitions require supermajority approval of two-thirds

200
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
of shareholders.

201
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,040
They could get most of the way there themselves, but to push it over the edge, they needed

202
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,760
to convince CNT shareholders to vote against their own interests.

203
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,480
But there was one whale.

204
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,000
The single largest outside shareholder, with 11.6% of ownership, was the South Korean National

205
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,800
Pension Service, which was run by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which was run by the

206
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:23,760
South Korean government, which at the time was run by President Park Geun-hye.

207
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,420
That's to say, if they could get to President Park, she might be able to get to the pension

208
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,600
service.

209
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,240
Conveniently, they had a backdoor—long-time Park confidant and daughter of an influential

210
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,000
cult leader Choi Sun-si.

211
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,880
It was an open secret among South Korea's power brokers that Choi, despite holding no

212
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,080
official position in Park's government, exerted deep influence over the President's

213
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,280
decision-making—even to the extent of picking out outfits, editing speeches, and making

214
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,040
specific policy propositions.

215
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,160
On the surface, Choi worked as the owner of an Italian restaurant in Seoul's Ritsi Gangam

216
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,640
neighborhood, but politicians and businesspeople were often seen walking up to the third floor,

217
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,400
to her office, where she solicited donations for two nonprofits she had set up—the Mir

218
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,480
and K Sports Foundations, supposedly dealing with cultural exchanges and sports-related

219
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,880
projects, but in practice acting as the top of the funnel in a complex, globe-spanning,

220
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,240
money laundering scheme.

221
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,440
Samsung, at the direction of E.J.

222
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,000
Young, donated a combined $36 million to Choi's foundations, and while still little is known

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,520
about the specific inner workings, soon after, the state pension fund voted in favor of C&T

224
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,040
and Choi's merger, the measure passed, the two companies combined, and the E family shored

225
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,320
up control of the Samsung empire into the next generation.

226
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,640
Of course, we now know about this.

227
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
We know how Park influenced the pension fund, we know how Choi influenced Park, and we know

228
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
how E.J.

229
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,920
Young influenced Choi.

230
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,560
Clearly, the secret was built, a massive scandal erupted, Park was impeached and jailed, E.J.

231
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,960
Young was indicted and jailed, but today, everything's pretty much back to normal.

232
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,520
Park was pardoned and freed in 2021, then one year later, so too was E.J.

233
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:12,760
Young, and as of October 27th, 2022, following the death of his father in 2020 after years

234
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,400
in that hospital bed, E.J.

235
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,640
Young was appointed chairman of the Samsung group.

236
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,680
Social order was returned.

237
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,800
The E family power was maintained.

238
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,000
This is a familiar refrain.

239
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
In fact, E.J.

240
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,440
Young's legal troubles are practically a mirror image of his father's from a decade

241
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
before.

242
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,120
Lee Kun-hee was sentenced to three years in jail in 2008 for, among other things, bribery,

243
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,200
but only one year later was pardoned by the President so that he could remain on the International

244
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,080
Olympic Committee and shepherd South Korea's bid for the 2018 Games through.

245
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,160
While that was the publicly stated reason, Lee Kun-hee was later revealed to have used

246
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,680
bribery to convince the President to pardon him for his bribery charges.

247
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,520
Later justifications were used in summer 2022 with the pardon of E.J.

248
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Young.

249
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:03,380
Samsung, South Korean business groups, and even the US Chamber of Commerce had been lobbying

250
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,720
for years for a pardon, and while on parole, Lee still acted as de facto leader of Samsung,

251
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,060
even meeting with President Biden in May 2022.

252
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,280
So two months on, President Jung-seok Yoy justified Lee's pardon in a straightforward

253
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,180
manner, saying that, as the only realistic family heir to the Samsung chairmanship, his

254
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,580
leadership was necessary to guide the country's largest company as both recovered from the

255
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,620
COVID-19 pandemic.

256
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,660
This justification isn't that far-fetched.

257
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,180
While undoubtedly unfair, considering the sheer degree of economic influence Samsung

258
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:38,920
has on South Korea, it might be pragmatic.

259
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,660
The ends might genuinely justify the means.

260
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:46,140
But it does perpetuate the cycle that seemingly cannot be broken.

261
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,260
South Korea, and especially South Korean politicians, cannot survive without Samsung.

262
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,780
But to an extent, Samsung can survive without South Korea.

263
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:01,660
It can always restructure, relocate, and refocus away from the nation in the long term.

264
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,620
This power structure of enterprise above nation is inherent to a situation where such a large

265
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,020
company exists in such a small country, but it's hard to believe it's tenable.

266
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,300
Companies can't run countries, and public dissent towards Samsung is growing in younger

267
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,340
generations, lacking the sympathy borne from viewing the company's integral role in the

268
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,820
nation's ascent, are increasingly fighting back against the cronyism and corruption.

269
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,340
It's tough to know which house of cards will crumble first.

270
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,220
Will it be the convoluted ownership structure that keeps the Lee family in control, or will

271
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,860
it be the tenuous power balance between Samsung and South Korea, knocked down by the very

272
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,500
people that make up the entirety of both venerable institutions?

273
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:47,460
For those of you that have demonstrated that you like this type of video by staying till

274
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,460
the end, I have some suggestions on what to watch next that I'm sure you'll like.

275
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,700
First I'd start with Polymatter's excellent series China Actually, which demystifies how

276
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,820
one of the world's most consequential countries really works by answering questions like why

277
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:05,540
China won't abandon its zero-COVID policies, and how the nation manages to survive without

278
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,820
essentially any major international allies.

279
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,340
Then I'd watch the episode of RealLifeLore's series Modern Conflicts on the Korean conflict

280
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:16,620
in the 21st century—it provides amazing insight into what's kept the tenuous peace,

281
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,700
and how that could crumble and threaten major multinationals like Samsung.

282
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,140
Both of these series, and far, far more, are exclusive to Nebula, which is no surprise

283
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,980
considering Polymatter, RealLifeLore, myself, and loads of other creators teamed up, founded

284
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,120
Nebula, and designed it from the ground floor to be the best home to the stuff we make.

285
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,140
Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have believed that enough to sign up so far, but to explain

286
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:42,960
to those of you who haven't, the idea behind Nebula was to remove many of the perverse

287
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,540
incentives that compromises video quality on ad-supported platforms like YouTube.

288
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,060
By putting it behind a paywall, we're incentivized as creators to make the absolute best videos

289
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,260
that will keep you all subscribed, rather than incentivized to just make the videos

290
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,580
that will make you click and zone out.

291
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,280
We use these subscription fees to pay to run the service, to provide ongoing revenue to

292
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,060
Nebula creators, and to fund our big-budget Nebula originals, which allows creators to

293
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,540
pursue their big, ambitious passion projects, which has led to some really good stuff, including

294
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,480
all of these made by the Wendover team.

295
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,680
Of course, even while being a good deal for the creators, we also want it to be a good

296
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,320
deal for you all, our audience, and it really is thanks to our partnership with CuriosityStream.

297
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,300
You see, they're an entirely different streaming service with a huge catalog of non-fiction

298
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,360
shows and documentaries like David Attenborough's Light on the Earth about the amazing world

299
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,840
of bioluminescent animals.

300
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,120
They're running a deal where by subscribing to any of their memberships at CuriosityStream.com

301
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,640
slash Wendover, they'll give you a Nebula subscription for free for as long as you stay

302
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,640
subscribed.

303
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,240
They've even discounted their annual plan to under $15 a year, which means you get two

304
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,620
streaming sites, both of which have great stuff that you'll actually watch, for less

305
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:51,280
than you'd probably pay for a month of one of the big streamers, and even while doing

306
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,800
that, you'll be helping support hundreds of independent creators that you probably

307
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
already watch.

308
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,920
So click the button on screen or head over to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover to sign

309
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
