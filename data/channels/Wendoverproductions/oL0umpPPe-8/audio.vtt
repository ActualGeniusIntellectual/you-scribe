00:00.000 --> 00:04.200
Geographically speaking, South Korea should be poor.

00:04.200 --> 00:08.960
Fractionally larger than the state of Indiana, South Korea isn't big, and unlike Indiana,

00:08.960 --> 00:11.360
it's not agriculturally productive.

00:11.360 --> 00:17.200
The nation is rugged and steep to the extent that only 22% of its land is actually arable.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.000
Worse still, this rocky disposition doesn't make up for its agricultural shortcomings

00:22.000 --> 00:24.800
through any sort of mineral wealth.

00:24.920 --> 00:30.860
South Korea has coal, but not much, as it ranks 49th globally in proven reserves—far

00:30.860 --> 00:33.320
behind even its dirt-poor neighbor to the north.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.760
And perhaps most problematic is the fact that the country's 81st in the world in natural

00:37.760 --> 00:43.360
gas reserves and is tied dead last in oil with none at all.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.000
And all of these are only the domestic challenges.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.400
Zoom out from the Rocky Peninsula and the region's a who's who of past and present

00:50.400 --> 00:52.120
powerhouses.

00:52.120 --> 00:56.800
Squeezed through history by empires around it and limited natural resources, South Korea

00:56.800 --> 00:57.800
should be poor.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.600
But it's not—it's rich.

01:00.600 --> 01:07.000
By nominal GDP, South Korea has the 10th largest economy in the world—a fact that has much

01:07.000 --> 01:10.920
to do with a single company.

01:10.920 --> 01:14.480
Before there was a republic of Korea, and before there was a war to define the economic

01:14.480 --> 01:18.920
doctrine of Korea, there was a grocery-trading shop in the southern city of Daegu that dealt

01:18.920 --> 01:22.520
in fish and noodles and went by the name of Samsung.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.000
While the shop's owner, Lee Byung-chui, couldn't have known it in 1938, his business

01:27.000 --> 01:31.680
would soon serve as the backbone of one of the most dramatic economic transformations

01:31.680 --> 01:37.760
of the 20th century—what economists would come to call the Miracle on the Han River.

01:37.760 --> 01:41.560
Now, Miracle is a bit of a misnomer.

01:41.560 --> 01:47.640
Ultimately, what took South Korean GDP from here to here, on 100-fold growth over 40 years,

01:47.680 --> 01:50.400
was extraordinary but also explainable.

01:50.400 --> 01:56.600
It was a function of successful long-term planning combining forces with savvy opportunists.

01:56.600 --> 02:01.440
It was also, in part, a function of the fact that in 1950, South Korea nearly ceased to

02:01.440 --> 02:04.000
exist at all.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.400
By August of that year, South Korean forces had little land left to defend after the communist

02:08.400 --> 02:11.520
north had taken all but this corner of the peninsula.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.520
From a southern perspective, it was the bleakest point in the war.

02:15.520 --> 02:21.800
But war, and South Korea's reversal of fortunes in the years that followed, created opportunity.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.560
In the midst of the Korean War's wreckage, Lee pivoted.

02:25.560 --> 02:30.220
In 1953, with leftover Japanese colonial assets selling for cents on the dollar, and much

02:30.220 --> 02:34.440
of South Korea's already meager industrial infrastructure in ruin, Lee launched Choe

02:34.440 --> 02:39.580
Jidang, a sugar refinery, then, in the year following, Choe Majik, a wool mill, both under

02:39.580 --> 02:43.080
what could now be considered the Samsung Group.

02:43.080 --> 02:46.820
For Lee, it was a logical progression, as South Koreans desperately needed everyday

02:46.820 --> 02:50.640
products and food while South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, had begun funneling

02:50.640 --> 02:55.200
international aid to allied industrialists in hopes of reducing reliance on imports.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.960
Rhee's government funded the construction of facilities and the importation of raw sugar

02:58.960 --> 03:03.720
for Lee's new projects and soon, with few to compete with in a war-torn nation and after

03:03.720 --> 03:09.540
a few timely expansions, the Samsung Group became the nation's fourth largest borrower.

03:09.540 --> 03:14.100
With cozy political connections and a stronghold over critical industry, the Samsung Group

03:14.100 --> 03:15.100
took off.

03:15.100 --> 03:19.100
In the years that followed, it acquired An Kook Fire and Marine Insurance and Cho Hung

03:19.100 --> 03:23.380
Bank while also becoming a major shareholder in four other banks.

03:23.380 --> 03:27.940
Less than a decade after acquiring that first sugar refinery, Samsung was the peninsula's

03:27.940 --> 03:33.460
most powerful conglomerate, and Lee's net worth was estimated to represent 19% of all

03:33.460 --> 03:35.460
South Korean wealth.

03:35.460 --> 03:38.620
The company had burst into a massive success.

03:38.620 --> 03:42.940
The problem was, while South Korea had distributed Western recovery funds and done away with

03:42.940 --> 03:47.900
feudal land practices, South Koreans were still poor and the country was still overwhelmingly

03:47.900 --> 03:52.660
agricultural and underdeveloped—issues that came to a head when the military overthrew

03:52.660 --> 03:55.620
Rhee's government in 1961.

03:55.620 --> 04:00.340
South Korea's economic rise began under a new leader—Park Chung-hee.

04:00.340 --> 04:04.500
With a laser-like focus on expanding industrial exports and maximizing South Korea's human

04:04.500 --> 04:10.580
capital, GDP growth shot skyward, only dipping under 9% annually on three occasions from

04:10.580 --> 04:13.540
1963 to 1978.

04:13.540 --> 04:16.620
Driving this growth more than anything were the conglomerates.

04:16.620 --> 04:20.380
While Park had publicly stated plans of crushing Korean monopolies that rose through shady

04:20.380 --> 04:25.180
dealings in the post-war period during his rise to power, his presidency took a different

04:25.180 --> 04:26.380
approach.

04:26.380 --> 04:30.340
Rather than breaking the conglomerates up, he assigned them the exportation era's most

04:30.340 --> 04:35.160
critical task—getting Korean-made goods to the wider world.

04:35.160 --> 04:39.220
With the government providing cheap steel, a plethora of subsidies, lenient loans, and

04:39.220 --> 04:44.020
tax breaks to major manufacturers, the likes of Samsung, LG, Hyundai, and SK Group did

04:44.020 --> 04:48.460
just that, expanding vertically and horizontally.

04:48.460 --> 04:53.800
These family-controlled, government-aided corporate groups came to be known as Chapels—a

04:53.800 --> 04:58.620
term that entered common Korean parlance during the 60s and 70s as the institutions grew.

04:58.620 --> 05:04.220
In the 70s and 80s, Chapels dominated, pulling the South Korean economy up as they pushed

05:04.220 --> 05:06.380
their products out to the world.

05:06.380 --> 05:10.820
Samsung launched TVs, then semiconductors, then mobile phones for export.

05:10.820 --> 05:15.140
Hyundai sold cars on the international market, and LG opened up a factory in Huntsville,

05:15.140 --> 05:16.140
Alabama.

05:16.140 --> 05:20.220
Though South Korean citizens came to argue over the role of Chapels in politics and society,

05:20.220 --> 05:25.180
what wasn't up for debate was the remarkably positive impacts they had on everyday standards

05:25.180 --> 05:26.180
of life.

05:26.460 --> 05:31.380
Life expectancy doubled from 1950 to 1990, while infant mortality cratered to less than

05:31.380 --> 05:34.060
a tenth of what it was at the war's end.

05:34.060 --> 05:38.080
All the while, Chapels showed no sign of slowing.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.600
Through the turn of the century, South Korea's GDP continued to grow, and even with the death

05:42.600 --> 05:47.920
of Yibongchui in 1987, Samsung continued to expand globally and dominate domestically

05:47.920 --> 05:51.420
under the guidance of his son, Yikong He.

05:51.460 --> 05:57.060
Today, just seven decades on from the company's prescient pivot, South Korea is Samsung, and

05:57.060 --> 05:59.220
Samsung is South Korea.

05:59.220 --> 06:03.460
For the average resident, it's a relationship with a corporation as deep as that with the

06:03.460 --> 06:09.380
government itself, perhaps best demonstrated through a single, eye-popping statistic.

06:09.380 --> 06:16.040
Year after year, just about 20% of the entire nation's GDP is made up of Samsung Group

06:16.040 --> 06:17.340
revenue.

06:17.340 --> 06:21.480
The only single entity that can rival that is the South Korean government, whose spending

06:21.480 --> 06:25.360
typically makes up 20-25% of GDP.

06:25.360 --> 06:30.020
This staggering degree of economic concentration makes even the most extreme examples in the

06:30.020 --> 06:31.860
rest of the world appear routine.

06:31.860 --> 06:37.700
Japan's biggest company, Toyota, accounts for about 5% of GDP, while the US's, Walmart,

06:37.700 --> 06:40.060
sits at just 2.5%.

06:40.060 --> 06:44.900
An entire fifth of an economy being attributed to a single company, especially a single company

06:44.900 --> 06:50.020
controlled by a single family in a major, advanced, diversified economy is absolutely

06:50.020 --> 06:53.860
unparalleled, even at a global scale.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.680
Undoubtedly, this exceptional centrality permeates into everyday life.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.580
Young people, and especially their parents, tend to fixate on the singular path towards

07:02.580 --> 07:05.300
becoming the so-called Samsung Man.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.460
It's considered the pinnacle of success to have passed all the academic and social

07:09.460 --> 07:14.060
hurdles necessary to be deemed worthy to work at the country's largest company, and therefore

07:14.220 --> 07:18.760
this idealistic vision is encapsulated across South Korean society.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.740
Characters in pursuit of a position of the company even borders on cliché as a plot

07:22.740 --> 07:25.300
point in the country's film and television.

07:25.300 --> 07:29.100
Just as American youth might fixate on moving to LA to make it into Hollywood or living

07:29.100 --> 07:34.020
in New York to break into big business, Korean kids prepare their entire childhood to apply

07:34.020 --> 07:39.220
for the opportunity to pack into testing centers along with 100,000 others to take the bi-annual

07:39.220 --> 07:44.620
Samsung Aptitude Test, hoping to score high enough to get recruiters' attention.

07:44.620 --> 07:48.420
Hundreds of thousands won't even be allowed to take the test, then all but a few thousand

07:48.420 --> 07:52.820
won't advance past it, leaving legions of disappointed youth who move on to the next

07:52.820 --> 07:57.660
layer in the social hierarchy of careers, working for the smaller, lesser chables like

07:57.660 --> 07:59.620
Hyundai or LG.

07:59.620 --> 08:03.580
For those that don't succeed there, they move on to the country's small and medium-sized

08:03.580 --> 08:07.580
employers—a fact they will try to hide from extended family and friends due to its

08:07.580 --> 08:10.740
characterization as failure.

08:10.740 --> 08:15.920
This centrality of focus can perhaps be attributed partially to the extent that Samsung has permeated

08:15.920 --> 08:17.500
into South Korean life.

08:17.500 --> 08:21.300
When you buy a smartphone in South Korea, you buy it from Samsung.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.980
When you need life insurance in South Korea, you purchase a policy with Samsung.

08:24.980 --> 08:29.220
When you take the ferry in South Korea, you step onto a ship built by Samsung.

08:29.220 --> 08:34.800
When you go to the theme park in South Korea, you once again pay your money to Samsung.

08:34.800 --> 08:39.280
This convoluted, seemingly scattershot structure of the conglomerate is reflective of the way

08:39.280 --> 08:44.160
that Samsung has followed and captured opportunity wherever it exists through history, and has

08:44.160 --> 08:48.280
actually been a critical factor in the Yi family's continued grip on power.

08:48.280 --> 08:53.520
Today, there are 59 major Samsung affiliate companies, although, like many aspects of

08:53.520 --> 08:58.560
Samsung's ownership structure, this is a soft, subjective definition, as so much of

08:58.560 --> 09:02.200
the way in which controls held across the empire is soft and subjective.

09:02.600 --> 09:07.020
But let's say there were just two affiliates—one of which wholly owned by the Yi family, one

09:07.020 --> 09:13.080
of which wholly owned by outside investors—both worth $50 million, respectively.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.740
Now, most major business decisions are settled with a simple majority, meaning to approve

09:17.740 --> 09:22.580
a budget for the next year, for example, just 50% worth of shareholders plus one needs to

09:22.580 --> 09:23.580
vote affirmatively.

09:23.580 --> 09:29.560
So that's to say, 49.9% of the Yi family ownership in the first affiliate is effectively

09:29.560 --> 09:33.680
worthless from a control perspective, at least for most decisions.

09:33.680 --> 09:39.760
So what they could do is sell that 49.9%, buy 49.9% of the other affiliate, then use

09:39.760 --> 09:44.680
a tiny bit of extra cash to get up to 50% plus one ownership of both affiliates.

09:44.680 --> 09:49.440
It's essentially the same amount of money invested, but two companies under Yi family

09:49.440 --> 09:51.660
control instead of one.

09:51.660 --> 09:55.560
But now using their control of both of these companies, they could instruct each to use

09:55.560 --> 10:00.460
annual operating profit to buy up 50% plus one ownership in a third affiliate, rather

10:00.460 --> 10:03.640
than paying it back to themselves and the other owners, which would be subject to income

10:03.640 --> 10:07.760
tax, and while they wouldn't directly own the third affiliate, they would control it

10:07.760 --> 10:12.040
because they control the first two affiliates, which control the third.

10:12.040 --> 10:16.940
And even then, while 50% plus one ownership is technically needed for control, in practice

10:16.940 --> 10:22.320
it's often overkill as it only becomes relevant in a case of complete dissent by every other

10:22.320 --> 10:26.520
investor, which is rare, especially when one has generated the degree of cult of personality

10:26.520 --> 10:28.440
that the Yi family has.

10:28.440 --> 10:33.460
So the Yi family might only need 30 or 40% direct or indirect control of a given affiliate

10:33.460 --> 10:38.980
if another 10 or 20% is owned by trustworthy, allied, outside investors.

10:38.980 --> 10:44.360
Through the decades, these and other systems have compounded to create this—a scattered,

10:44.360 --> 10:48.520
convoluted web of ownership that can confuse even the savviest financial analysts, but

10:48.520 --> 10:52.240
ultimately result in what matters to the Yi family most.

10:52.280 --> 10:55.120
They need control of the entire empire.

10:55.120 --> 11:01.520
But these structures are tenuous, especially when someone dies.

11:01.520 --> 11:06.660
South Korea has one of the highest inheritance taxes in the world—50%.

11:06.660 --> 11:10.360
That means that 50% of the value of assets goes to the government when they're passed

11:10.360 --> 11:12.400
from one generation to the next.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.020
Therefore, if Lee Kong-hee, for example, passed $5 billion in shares to his son, Lee Jae-yong,

11:18.020 --> 11:21.960
the heir would have to find some $2.5 billion to pay the government, which he likely could

11:22.000 --> 11:28.720
only do by selling $2.5 billion worth of shares—therefore losing the voting power that they bestow.

11:28.720 --> 11:35.000
This hypothetical started to feel far more concrete in May of 2014 due to this—the

11:35.000 --> 11:38.280
heart attack of Lee Kong-hee.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.320
The chairman survived, but only barely.

11:41.320 --> 11:46.240
As he sat comatose in a hospital bed at the Samsung Medical Center for days, weeks, months,

11:46.240 --> 11:50.600
and eventually years, his children were thrown into a power struggle as they used the time

11:50.600 --> 11:55.400
to craft a plan that would keep Samsung in family control after paying inheritance taxes

11:55.400 --> 11:59.860
upon their father's inevitable and seemingly impending death.

11:59.860 --> 12:05.840
This was difficult, the numbers were tough, and so it required some creativity—perhaps

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
too much.

12:06.840 --> 12:11.040
Two of the most critical links in the e-family ownership web were Samsung Construction and

12:11.040 --> 12:16.600
Trading, or CNT, and Choi Industries—each of which, as two of the oldest Samsung affiliates,

12:16.600 --> 12:19.840
acted primarily as de facto holding companies of sorts.

12:20.080 --> 12:24.280
But e-family control of CNT, and therefore electronics, engineering, chemicals, and the

12:24.280 --> 12:29.800
other affiliates partially owned by CNT, was fading as outside, increasingly hostile investors

12:29.800 --> 12:31.880
continued to buy in.

12:31.880 --> 12:37.400
If Lee Kong-hee never awoke from his coma, the 50% inheritance tax would be a death blow,

12:37.400 --> 12:39.800
and the house of cards would crumble.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.080
Therefore, a plan.

12:42.080 --> 12:45.700
They'd merge CNT and Choi.

12:45.700 --> 12:49.480
While quantifying their control of each is difficult due to the extent of their soft,

12:49.480 --> 12:53.760
informal control, what's important to note is that e-control of Choi was much stronger

12:53.760 --> 12:58.580
than that of CNT, so what would make the restructuring productive for them would be if it overvalued

12:58.580 --> 13:04.020
Choi and undervalued CNT so that post-merger, they'd effectively end up with more relative

13:04.020 --> 13:08.780
control over the new combined de facto holding company, and therefore more control over the

13:08.780 --> 13:13.380
entire empire without having spent a cent.

13:13.380 --> 13:17.280
So they proposed exactly that—an objectively bad deal.

13:17.280 --> 13:21.040
One CNT share would convert to 0.35 Choi shares.

13:21.040 --> 13:25.960
CNT shareholders, and specifically its largest, American hedge fund Elliott, started campaigning

13:25.960 --> 13:30.640
against the merger, arguing that Choi was objectively worth about $3.42 billion, but

13:30.640 --> 13:37.560
a merger ratio of 0.35 inflated its value to $4.08 billion, effectively gifting hundreds

13:37.560 --> 13:43.240
of millions of dollars in value to the ease straight from the pockets of CNT shareholders.

13:43.240 --> 13:49.200
It was an unbelievably good deal for the family, but they couldn't do it alone.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.820
Unlike most business decisions, which the e-family could directly control through their

13:52.820 --> 13:58.180
de facto simple majority, mergers and acquisitions require supermajority approval of two-thirds

13:58.180 --> 13:59.180
of shareholders.

13:59.180 --> 14:03.040
They could get most of the way there themselves, but to push it over the edge, they needed

14:03.040 --> 14:07.760
to convince CNT shareholders to vote against their own interests.

14:07.760 --> 14:10.480
But there was one whale.

14:10.480 --> 14:16.000
The single largest outside shareholder, with 11.6% of ownership, was the South Korean National

14:16.000 --> 14:19.800
Pension Service, which was run by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which was run by the

14:19.800 --> 14:23.760
South Korean government, which at the time was run by President Park Geun-hye.

14:23.760 --> 14:30.420
That's to say, if they could get to President Park, she might be able to get to the pension

14:30.420 --> 14:31.600
service.

14:31.600 --> 14:37.240
Conveniently, they had a backdoor—long-time Park confidant and daughter of an influential

14:37.240 --> 14:39.000
cult leader Choi Sun-si.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.880
It was an open secret among South Korea's power brokers that Choi, despite holding no

14:43.880 --> 14:48.080
official position in Park's government, exerted deep influence over the President's

14:48.080 --> 14:52.280
decision-making—even to the extent of picking out outfits, editing speeches, and making

14:52.280 --> 14:55.040
specific policy propositions.

14:55.040 --> 14:59.160
On the surface, Choi worked as the owner of an Italian restaurant in Seoul's Ritsi Gangam

14:59.160 --> 15:03.640
neighborhood, but politicians and businesspeople were often seen walking up to the third floor,

15:03.640 --> 15:08.400
to her office, where she solicited donations for two nonprofits she had set up—the Mir

15:08.440 --> 15:12.480
and K Sports Foundations, supposedly dealing with cultural exchanges and sports-related

15:12.480 --> 15:17.880
projects, but in practice acting as the top of the funnel in a complex, globe-spanning,

15:17.880 --> 15:19.240
money laundering scheme.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.440
Samsung, at the direction of E.J.

15:21.440 --> 15:27.000
Young, donated a combined $36 million to Choi's foundations, and while still little is known

15:27.000 --> 15:32.520
about the specific inner workings, soon after, the state pension fund voted in favor of C&T

15:32.520 --> 15:37.040
and Choi's merger, the measure passed, the two companies combined, and the E family shored

15:37.040 --> 15:40.320
up control of the Samsung empire into the next generation.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.640
Of course, we now know about this.

15:44.640 --> 15:48.640
We know how Park influenced the pension fund, we know how Choi influenced Park, and we know

15:48.640 --> 15:49.640
how E.J.

15:49.640 --> 15:50.920
Young influenced Choi.

15:50.920 --> 15:56.560
Clearly, the secret was built, a massive scandal erupted, Park was impeached and jailed, E.J.

15:56.560 --> 16:01.960
Young was indicted and jailed, but today, everything's pretty much back to normal.

16:01.960 --> 16:06.520
Park was pardoned and freed in 2021, then one year later, so too was E.J.

16:06.520 --> 16:12.760
Young, and as of October 27th, 2022, following the death of his father in 2020 after years

16:12.760 --> 16:14.400
in that hospital bed, E.J.

16:14.400 --> 16:18.640
Young was appointed chairman of the Samsung group.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.680
Social order was returned.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.800
The E family power was maintained.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.000
This is a familiar refrain.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
In fact, E.J.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.440
Young's legal troubles are practically a mirror image of his father's from a decade

16:32.440 --> 16:33.440
before.

16:33.440 --> 16:38.120
Lee Kun-hee was sentenced to three years in jail in 2008 for, among other things, bribery,

16:38.120 --> 16:42.200
but only one year later was pardoned by the President so that he could remain on the International

16:42.200 --> 16:46.080
Olympic Committee and shepherd South Korea's bid for the 2018 Games through.

16:46.080 --> 16:50.160
While that was the publicly stated reason, Lee Kun-hee was later revealed to have used

16:50.160 --> 16:54.680
bribery to convince the President to pardon him for his bribery charges.

16:54.680 --> 16:58.520
Later justifications were used in summer 2022 with the pardon of E.J.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
Young.

16:59.520 --> 17:03.380
Samsung, South Korean business groups, and even the US Chamber of Commerce had been lobbying

17:03.380 --> 17:08.720
for years for a pardon, and while on parole, Lee still acted as de facto leader of Samsung,

17:08.720 --> 17:12.060
even meeting with President Biden in May 2022.

17:12.060 --> 17:16.280
So two months on, President Jung-seok Yoy justified Lee's pardon in a straightforward

17:16.280 --> 17:21.180
manner, saying that, as the only realistic family heir to the Samsung chairmanship, his

17:21.180 --> 17:25.580
leadership was necessary to guide the country's largest company as both recovered from the

17:25.580 --> 17:27.620
COVID-19 pandemic.

17:27.620 --> 17:30.660
This justification isn't that far-fetched.

17:30.660 --> 17:35.180
While undoubtedly unfair, considering the sheer degree of economic influence Samsung

17:35.180 --> 17:38.920
has on South Korea, it might be pragmatic.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.660
The ends might genuinely justify the means.

17:41.660 --> 17:46.140
But it does perpetuate the cycle that seemingly cannot be broken.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.260
South Korea, and especially South Korean politicians, cannot survive without Samsung.

17:52.260 --> 17:55.780
But to an extent, Samsung can survive without South Korea.

17:55.780 --> 18:01.660
It can always restructure, relocate, and refocus away from the nation in the long term.

18:01.660 --> 18:06.620
This power structure of enterprise above nation is inherent to a situation where such a large

18:06.620 --> 18:12.020
company exists in such a small country, but it's hard to believe it's tenable.

18:12.020 --> 18:16.300
Companies can't run countries, and public dissent towards Samsung is growing in younger

18:16.300 --> 18:20.340
generations, lacking the sympathy borne from viewing the company's integral role in the

18:20.340 --> 18:24.820
nation's ascent, are increasingly fighting back against the cronyism and corruption.

18:24.820 --> 18:29.340
It's tough to know which house of cards will crumble first.

18:29.340 --> 18:33.220
Will it be the convoluted ownership structure that keeps the Lee family in control, or will

18:33.220 --> 18:37.860
it be the tenuous power balance between Samsung and South Korea, knocked down by the very

18:37.860 --> 18:42.500
people that make up the entirety of both venerable institutions?

18:42.500 --> 18:47.460
For those of you that have demonstrated that you like this type of video by staying till

18:47.460 --> 18:52.460
the end, I have some suggestions on what to watch next that I'm sure you'll like.

18:52.460 --> 18:56.700
First I'd start with Polymatter's excellent series China Actually, which demystifies how

18:56.700 --> 19:00.820
one of the world's most consequential countries really works by answering questions like why

19:00.820 --> 19:05.540
China won't abandon its zero-COVID policies, and how the nation manages to survive without

19:05.540 --> 19:08.820
essentially any major international allies.

19:08.820 --> 19:12.340
Then I'd watch the episode of RealLifeLore's series Modern Conflicts on the Korean conflict

19:12.340 --> 19:16.620
in the 21st century—it provides amazing insight into what's kept the tenuous peace,

19:16.620 --> 19:20.700
and how that could crumble and threaten major multinationals like Samsung.

19:20.700 --> 19:25.140
Both of these series, and far, far more, are exclusive to Nebula, which is no surprise

19:25.140 --> 19:29.980
considering Polymatter, RealLifeLore, myself, and loads of other creators teamed up, founded

19:29.980 --> 19:35.120
Nebula, and designed it from the ground floor to be the best home to the stuff we make.

19:35.700 --> 19:39.140
Over 50,000 Wendover viewers have believed that enough to sign up so far, but to explain

19:39.140 --> 19:42.960
to those of you who haven't, the idea behind Nebula was to remove many of the perverse

19:42.960 --> 19:47.540
incentives that compromises video quality on ad-supported platforms like YouTube.

19:47.540 --> 19:52.060
By putting it behind a paywall, we're incentivized as creators to make the absolute best videos

19:52.060 --> 19:55.260
that will keep you all subscribed, rather than incentivized to just make the videos

19:55.260 --> 19:57.580
that will make you click and zone out.

19:57.580 --> 20:01.280
We use these subscription fees to pay to run the service, to provide ongoing revenue to

20:01.280 --> 20:05.060
Nebula creators, and to fund our big-budget Nebula originals, which allows creators to

20:05.060 --> 20:09.540
pursue their big, ambitious passion projects, which has led to some really good stuff, including

20:09.540 --> 20:12.480
all of these made by the Wendover team.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.680
Of course, even while being a good deal for the creators, we also want it to be a good

20:15.680 --> 20:20.320
deal for you all, our audience, and it really is thanks to our partnership with CuriosityStream.

20:20.320 --> 20:25.300
You see, they're an entirely different streaming service with a huge catalog of non-fiction

20:25.300 --> 20:29.360
shows and documentaries like David Attenborough's Light on the Earth about the amazing world

20:29.360 --> 20:30.840
of bioluminescent animals.

20:30.840 --> 20:35.120
They're running a deal where by subscribing to any of their memberships at CuriosityStream.com

20:35.120 --> 20:39.640
slash Wendover, they'll give you a Nebula subscription for free for as long as you stay

20:39.640 --> 20:40.640
subscribed.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.240
They've even discounted their annual plan to under $15 a year, which means you get two

20:44.240 --> 20:47.620
streaming sites, both of which have great stuff that you'll actually watch, for less

20:47.620 --> 20:51.280
than you'd probably pay for a month of one of the big streamers, and even while doing

20:51.280 --> 20:54.800
that, you'll be helping support hundreds of independent creators that you probably

20:54.800 --> 20:55.800
already watch.

20:56.240 --> 20:59.920
So click the button on screen or head over to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover to sign

20:59.920 --> 21:02.920
up, and thanks in advance for your support.
