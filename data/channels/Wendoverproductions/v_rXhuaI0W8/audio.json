There was a time, earlier in 2020, when there was no news but COVID news. There was this time when every word, of every story, of every front page, of every paper, either directly or indirectly dealt with the coronavirus, but now, many months on, that is no longer the case. The world has awoken in a way that there is more of relevance. However, in certain circles, in those most dramatically impacted, COVID is still everything. That is certainly the case in aviation. Almost nothing they do nowadays is not dictated by the ever-present backdrop of the centuries first pandemic. Most of what anyone has been talking about recently, including us, has been on how this will fundamentally change the industry\u2014on how the airline of 2029 will look markedly different than that of 2019. Today, though, in October 2020, we're nearing the one-year mark since when SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have made the jump from animal to human. With this amount of time behind us, the airline industry has already changed. The airline of October 2020 is already different than the airline of October 2019. So, to see what's happened already, we're going to look at eight flights that, for reasons either big or small, would have been considered strange, unique, or even unimaginable just a year ago today, but now are nothing out of the ordinary. We'll start with the end for one aircraft\u2014at least for a while. On September 25th, Qantas's VH-OQI, an A380, flew from Dresden, Germany to Victorville, California\u2014a route that is quite clearly unordinary for an airline based in Australia, but it's not the route that made this notable. VH-OQI had been flown to Dresden in March for cabin refurbishment. By September, though, it became clear that not only was the refurbishment unnecessary, but that the aircraft was too. Therefore, the decision was made to put this fleet of aircraft into long-term storage, and this particular flight from Dresden would mark the last time a Qantas A380 would be airborne until at least 2023. This demonstrates that this is the soonest Qantas believes passenger demand could return to 2019 levels\u2014when the A380 served as its flagship aircraft. However, the fact specifically that the airline would bother storing the aircraft, rather than scrapping or selling it, also marks a hint of optimism. Long-term aircraft storage is not cheap\u2014it involves quite regular maintenance and monitoring, and so this means that Qantas does truly believe that demand will return to the levels of before\u2014an opinion not held by all. Qantas desperately needs every dollar they can get right now, so they would only spend money on keeping their A380s if they truly believed that there was a significant need for super-large aircraft in the medium-term future. Therefore, while it's plenty easy to find negative signs for the future of aviation, this flight does represent a belief that the good times will return, for airlines. This next flight, meanwhile, didn't, and in some ways couldn't, exist a year ago. On October 8th, Southwest Flight 1920 flew from Phoenix, Arizona to San Jose del Cabo, Mexico. This certainly looks like a fairly normal flight\u2014just another big city to resort town route\u2014but the backstory behind it explains its peculiarity. Mexico is one of the few major countries that has not restricted entry to Americans, so, when the US emerged from lockdown in May and June, Cabo was one of the first international destinations added back to Southwest's network. This is, without a doubt, due to the fact that it's both open to Americans and, crucially, a leisure destination. Airplane demand is traditionally split into leisure and business, and these two segments have had very different stories of recovery. Leisure demand picked up quickly and sharply as soon as stay-at-home orders lifted, while business demand has barely increased at all. This is no surprise considering that, overwhelmingly, offices are still closed, conferences are still cancelled, and clients are still cautious. Therefore, airlines have had to respond by removing capacity from where people travel for work and adding it to where people travel for vacation, such as Cabo. Right now, there's a huge amount of capacity being dumped into the Florida and Mexico markets. For example, in the coming winter, there are 24 flights a week scheduled between New York and Cabo versus just two a week last winter. Some leisure destinations have not only recovered faster, but have come out ahead versus how they were before. This is certainly the case with Cabo, and the October 8th flight from Phoenix represented the first of many, with Southwest adding this city pair to their network. Overall, leisure is winning, business is losing, and therefore airlines that have historically been more leisure-oriented, like Southwest, have fared far better than their more business-oriented competitors. One of those more business-oriented competitors is United, which announced this new route from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Fort Myers, Florida. Much like Southwest's flight, this probably doesn't seem that strange, but for United, it's a dramatic deviation from the mean. You see, like most legacy carriers, United has traditionally been a strict follower of the hub-and-spoke school of network planning. Every single flight they fly, with very limited exception, either originates or terminates in DC, Newark, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Guam\u2014their hub airports. This flight, though, along with a whole package of others announced at the same time, does not. United wouldn't break from precedent without a good reason, and so this must mean something. Most likely, it indicates a mix of desperation and innovation\u2014desperation because they're now seriously competing on leisure routes, something they avoided before, and innovation because United is reinventing its network design and getting a little more creative. Creativity and innovation is what pushes an industry forward, and so, even if it comes in the form of a route that is just ever so slightly different, it demonstrates a characteristic that would be welcome once the downturn is over. Airlines are now willing to find revenue wherever it might be, whereas in the past they might have only chosen to pursue the most profitable form of revenue, so this flight\u2014UA-2861, from Guam to Singapore on a 787\u2014is another that could never have existed a year ago. Now, Guam is a United hub, but it's never had flights to Singapore, definitely never had these on a 787, and absolutely never operated them without passengers, and yet now, four times a week, they are. With the current lack in long-haul flights, which traditionally carry freight in their belly holds, global cargo capacity is down, meaning prices are up, meaning airplanes can reliably turn a slight profit flying passenger airplanes without passengers. In a matter of months, United has turned its Guam hub essentially into a mini cargo hub, with regular flights stopping over from the US, going on to Asian destinations. Beyond this, globally, United now operates hundreds of cargo-only flights per week, even though one year ago, it didn't operate a single one. Whether it'll turn Guam into a major passenger hub for the US-to-Asia market is an unanswerable question right now, but at the very least, this further demonstrates how airlines will truly take any revenue they can get, even if it involves turning into a cargo airline in a matter of months. Revenue is, of course, half of the equation for profitability, but the other part is, of course, costs. Therefore, for weathering this crisis, airlines need to get as much revenue as possible, while also minimizing cost. This American Airlines flight from Eagle County Airport to Aspen was not about bringing in revenue, but rather about reducing costs. You see, only 29 miles or 46 kilometers separate these two airports, meaning nobody's really looking to fly between them. However, this flight was part of an overall flight that went from Dallas to Eagle County to Aspen to Montrose and back to Dallas, meaning a passenger going to Montrose would have to sit through at least two stops. Now, a passenger is much more likely to take a one-stop itinerary than a two, so in a time when American Airlines is fighting for every customer it can get, why would it fly such a clearly uncompetitive itinerary? Well, the reason is that American didn't really care how many people took this flight, because it was always going to be very close to none. They couldn't, however, just cancel it, because airlines in the US received a package of financial aid from the government in exchange for, among other things, agreeing to continue serving every airport they did previously. American had previously served these three airports which primarily act as entry points for tourist towns\u2014each of which implemented restrictions preventing visitors during their stay-at-home periods. This meant demand for traveling to these places was essentially zero\u2014in the case of Aspen in May, for example, just 7% of American's seats were filled. Therefore, instead of operating three different empty flights, they rather operated just one that stopped at each of the three airports, thereby creating that 29-mile flight which was, at the time, the shortest commercial flight in America. Until the CARES Act expired on October 1st, American and other airlines found ways to both stay loyal to their new masters in the government while also minimizing costs to the lowest level. But back on the revenue side, on September 25th, Qantas operated QF 1570 from Canberra to Gold Coast Airport in Australia. Exactly one week earlier, on September 18th, Queensland, the state that the Gold Coast is in, announced that it was opening its borders to the Australian Capital Territory, the territory that Canberra is in. That very same day, Qantas announced that it would start a new route between these two airports one week later. Now, normally, when airlines announce new routes, they do so months or even years in advance. For example, when Qantas announced a new route from Brisbane to Chicago, originally slated to start in April 2020 but now pushed back, they did so in July 2019\u2014a full eight months in advance. To shorten this to one week is unprecedented, but with borders opening and closing at a moment's notice, predicting demand has become incredibly tough. So, in this case, Qantas saw that demand for travel to Queensland was going to surge and they were able to respond lightning fast\u2014allowing for them to capture it. Other airlines around the world have done the same, and the industry, in general, has become more agile and data-driven. These will be useful skills for airlines to maintain long into the future as, when there is demand, a company's excuse should never be that they couldn't act fast enough to capture it. Sometimes, though, it's strategic to ignore demand. On October 6th, American Airlines flew its last flight from Greenville, North Carolina, for at least a month, but likely longer. An airline pulling service from a small regional airport in a time of economic crisis is nothing unexpected, but this case stands out. The cut was originally announced as only for a month, from October 7th to November 4th\u2014a date recognizable for its proximity to the November 3rd US election. There's no reason for an airline to believe that the economic conditions that make a route unprofitable on October 7th would be resolved by November 4th\u2014if anything, they should get worse as winter nears, so suspending a route for only one month to save money doesn't make sense. In addition, this service suspension was announced along with 14 others impacting 14 small airports in 14 different states\u2014including Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, and other swing states in the 2020 election. Also, many of the states that American Airlines cut service to have incumbent senators who polling data indicate might lose on November 3rd. This includes Thom Tillis who, as happens when small airports lose their only commercial service, immediately faced pressure from his constituents to bring flights back to Greenville. American Airlines is essentially playing chicken with the US government. With CARES Act funding having now expired, airlines desperately want more financial aid from Congress, and with 15 routes to 15 states cut, there are now 30 senators that have to answer for why they haven't passed an airline relief bill to help save the small town's service. In the end, three of these suspensions didn't go through, but most others were extended another month, thereby ratcheting up the pressure on Congress by signaling that these temporary suspensions might not be so temporary if they don't get the relief they say they need. While in the US and elsewhere, airlines' continued survival is increasingly linked to politics, in other places, it's always been. China's aviation recovery has played a key part in the country's narrative of overall recovery, which is, at least compared to other places, genuine. On August 28th, Chengdu Airlines flight 2712 was the first to leave from the airport that, eight months earlier, undoubtedly played a central role in spreading the virus across the globe\u2014Wuhan Tianhe International. This flight, though, was the first of hundreds to leave Wuhan that day, and that day, in fact, was the first when the number of flights in the country reached 100% relative to January 1st of the same year. China's aviation recovery was fast, in part because China's virus recovery was fast. The country's airlines are not completely back to normal yet\u2014their load factors and fares are lower than before and their international market is still nearly non-existent\u2014but China's airlines, along with those of New Zealand, Australia, and all the other countries that have successfully curbed the virus, demonstrate that the economic crisis cannot end until the public health crisis does, and therefore, no matter which one cares about more, the route to recovery always starts with health.
