16300	21720	There was a time, earlier in 2020, when there was no news but COVID news.
21720	27520	There was this time when every word, of every story, of every front page, of every paper,
27520	34360	either directly or indirectly dealt with the coronavirus, but now, many months on, that
34360	36800	is no longer the case.
36800	41160	The world has awoken in a way that there is more of relevance.
41160	49260	However, in certain circles, in those most dramatically impacted, COVID is still everything.
49260	52480	That is certainly the case in aviation.
52480	57420	Almost nothing they do nowadays is not dictated by the ever-present backdrop of the centuries
57420	59460	first pandemic.
59460	63580	Most of what anyone has been talking about recently, including us, has been on how this
63580	68800	will fundamentally change the industry—on how the airline of 2029 will look markedly
68800	70540	different than that of 2019.
70540	77220	Today, though, in October 2020, we're nearing the one-year mark since when SARS-CoV-2 is
77220	80000	believed to have made the jump from animal to human.
80000	85280	With this amount of time behind us, the airline industry has already changed.
85280	91200	The airline of October 2020 is already different than the airline of October 2019.
91200	96620	So, to see what's happened already, we're going to look at eight flights that, for reasons
96620	101940	either big or small, would have been considered strange, unique, or even unimaginable just
101940	106600	a year ago today, but now are nothing out of the ordinary.
106600	111800	We'll start with the end for one aircraft—at least for a while.
111800	117620	On September 25th, Qantas's VH-OQI, an A380, flew from Dresden, Germany to Victorville,
117620	123160	California—a route that is quite clearly unordinary for an airline based in Australia,
123160	126360	but it's not the route that made this notable.
126360	130840	VH-OQI had been flown to Dresden in March for cabin refurbishment.
130840	135920	By September, though, it became clear that not only was the refurbishment unnecessary,
135920	138160	but that the aircraft was too.
138520	142640	Therefore, the decision was made to put this fleet of aircraft into long-term storage,
142640	147120	and this particular flight from Dresden would mark the last time a Qantas A380 would be
147120	151160	airborne until at least 2023.
151160	155960	This demonstrates that this is the soonest Qantas believes passenger demand could return
155960	160480	to 2019 levels—when the A380 served as its flagship aircraft.
160480	165520	However, the fact specifically that the airline would bother storing the aircraft, rather
165520	170460	than scrapping or selling it, also marks a hint of optimism.
170460	175400	Long-term aircraft storage is not cheap—it involves quite regular maintenance and monitoring,
175400	181320	and so this means that Qantas does truly believe that demand will return to the levels of before—an
181320	183480	opinion not held by all.
183480	187420	Qantas desperately needs every dollar they can get right now, so they would only spend
187420	191760	money on keeping their A380s if they truly believed that there was a significant need
191760	195000	for super-large aircraft in the medium-term future.
195000	199560	Therefore, while it's plenty easy to find negative signs for the future of aviation,
199560	204960	this flight does represent a belief that the good times will return, for airlines.
204960	210260	This next flight, meanwhile, didn't, and in some ways couldn't, exist a year ago.
210260	215520	On October 8th, Southwest Flight 1920 flew from Phoenix, Arizona to San Jose del Cabo,
215520	216520	Mexico.
216520	220360	This certainly looks like a fairly normal flight—just another big city to resort town
220360	224860	route—but the backstory behind it explains its peculiarity.
224860	230400	Mexico is one of the few major countries that has not restricted entry to Americans, so,
230400	235560	when the US emerged from lockdown in May and June, Cabo was one of the first international
235560	238740	destinations added back to Southwest's network.
238740	244100	This is, without a doubt, due to the fact that it's both open to Americans and, crucially,
244100	246120	a leisure destination.
246120	250360	Airplane demand is traditionally split into leisure and business, and these two segments
250360	253680	have had very different stories of recovery.
253680	259160	Leisure demand picked up quickly and sharply as soon as stay-at-home orders lifted, while
259160	262280	business demand has barely increased at all.
262280	267200	This is no surprise considering that, overwhelmingly, offices are still closed, conferences are
267200	270440	still cancelled, and clients are still cautious.
270440	274260	Therefore, airlines have had to respond by removing capacity from where people travel
274260	279180	for work and adding it to where people travel for vacation, such as Cabo.
279180	284500	Right now, there's a huge amount of capacity being dumped into the Florida and Mexico markets.
284500	289380	For example, in the coming winter, there are 24 flights a week scheduled between New York
289380	292960	and Cabo versus just two a week last winter.
292960	297620	Some leisure destinations have not only recovered faster, but have come out ahead versus how
297620	299260	they were before.
299260	303420	This is certainly the case with Cabo, and the October 8th flight from Phoenix represented
303420	307860	the first of many, with Southwest adding this city pair to their network.
307860	312960	Overall, leisure is winning, business is losing, and therefore airlines that have historically
312960	318180	been more leisure-oriented, like Southwest, have fared far better than their more business-oriented
318180	319940	competitors.
319940	324100	One of those more business-oriented competitors is United, which announced this new route
324100	327220	from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Fort Myers, Florida.
327220	332340	Much like Southwest's flight, this probably doesn't seem that strange, but for United,
332340	336080	it's a dramatic deviation from the mean.
336080	341260	You see, like most legacy carriers, United has traditionally been a strict follower of
341260	344300	the hub-and-spoke school of network planning.
344300	349620	Every single flight they fly, with very limited exception, either originates or terminates
349620	355820	in DC, Newark, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Guam—their hub
355820	357180	airports.
357180	361780	This flight, though, along with a whole package of others announced at the same time, does
361780	362780	not.
362780	368480	United wouldn't break from precedent without a good reason, and so this must mean something.
368480	374100	Most likely, it indicates a mix of desperation and innovation—desperation because they're
374100	378600	now seriously competing on leisure routes, something they avoided before, and innovation
378600	384540	because United is reinventing its network design and getting a little more creative.
384540	389420	Creativity and innovation is what pushes an industry forward, and so, even if it comes
389420	394620	in the form of a route that is just ever so slightly different, it demonstrates a characteristic
394620	398980	that would be welcome once the downturn is over.
398980	402920	Airlines are now willing to find revenue wherever it might be, whereas in the past they might
402920	408740	have only chosen to pursue the most profitable form of revenue, so this flight—UA-2861,
408740	414380	from Guam to Singapore on a 787—is another that could never have existed a year ago.
414380	419420	Now, Guam is a United hub, but it's never had flights to Singapore, definitely never
419420	426060	had these on a 787, and absolutely never operated them without passengers, and yet now, four
426060	428380	times a week, they are.
428380	431720	With the current lack in long-haul flights, which traditionally carry freight in their
431720	436440	belly holds, global cargo capacity is down, meaning prices are up, meaning airplanes can
436440	441740	reliably turn a slight profit flying passenger airplanes without passengers.
441740	446120	In a matter of months, United has turned its Guam hub essentially into a mini cargo
446120	451500	hub, with regular flights stopping over from the US, going on to Asian destinations.
451500	457300	Beyond this, globally, United now operates hundreds of cargo-only flights per week, even
457300	460780	though one year ago, it didn't operate a single one.
460780	465380	Whether it'll turn Guam into a major passenger hub for the US-to-Asia market is an unanswerable
465380	470060	question right now, but at the very least, this further demonstrates how airlines will
470060	474580	truly take any revenue they can get, even if it involves turning into a cargo airline
474580	476980	in a matter of months.
476980	481900	Revenue is, of course, half of the equation for profitability, but the other part is,
481900	483780	of course, costs.
483780	489140	Therefore, for weathering this crisis, airlines need to get as much revenue as possible, while
489140	491420	also minimizing cost.
491420	496260	This American Airlines flight from Eagle County Airport to Aspen was not about bringing in
496260	499140	revenue, but rather about reducing costs.
499140	505060	You see, only 29 miles or 46 kilometers separate these two airports, meaning nobody's really
505060	507020	looking to fly between them.
507020	511180	However, this flight was part of an overall flight that went from Dallas to Eagle County
511180	515840	to Aspen to Montrose and back to Dallas, meaning a passenger going to Montrose would have to
515840	518220	sit through at least two stops.
518220	524100	Now, a passenger is much more likely to take a one-stop itinerary than a two, so in a time
524100	529140	when American Airlines is fighting for every customer it can get, why would it fly such
529140	531740	a clearly uncompetitive itinerary?
531740	536340	Well, the reason is that American didn't really care how many people took this flight,
536340	539100	because it was always going to be very close to none.
539100	543640	They couldn't, however, just cancel it, because airlines in the US received a package
543640	548180	of financial aid from the government in exchange for, among other things, agreeing to continue
548180	551580	serving every airport they did previously.
551580	555980	American had previously served these three airports which primarily act as entry points
555980	560100	for tourist towns—each of which implemented restrictions preventing visitors during their
560100	561660	stay-at-home periods.
561660	566300	This meant demand for traveling to these places was essentially zero—in the case of Aspen
566300	570660	in May, for example, just 7% of American's seats were filled.
570660	575300	Therefore, instead of operating three different empty flights, they rather operated just one
575300	579680	that stopped at each of the three airports, thereby creating that 29-mile flight which
579680	583880	was, at the time, the shortest commercial flight in America.
583880	588520	Until the CARES Act expired on October 1st, American and other airlines found ways to
588520	592640	both stay loyal to their new masters in the government while also minimizing costs to
592640	594360	the lowest level.
594360	599920	But back on the revenue side, on September 25th, Qantas operated QF 1570 from Canberra
599920	603000	to Gold Coast Airport in Australia.
603000	607320	Exactly one week earlier, on September 18th, Queensland, the state that the Gold Coast
607320	611420	is in, announced that it was opening its borders to the Australian Capital Territory,
611420	613260	the territory that Canberra is in.
613260	617400	That very same day, Qantas announced that it would start a new route between these two
617400	619880	airports one week later.
619880	625760	Now, normally, when airlines announce new routes, they do so months or even years in
625760	626760	advance.
626760	631120	For example, when Qantas announced a new route from Brisbane to Chicago, originally slated
631120	637200	to start in April 2020 but now pushed back, they did so in July 2019—a full eight months
637200	638380	in advance.
638380	642720	To shorten this to one week is unprecedented, but with borders opening and closing at a
642720	647040	moment's notice, predicting demand has become incredibly tough.
647040	652520	So, in this case, Qantas saw that demand for travel to Queensland was going to surge and
652520	657560	they were able to respond lightning fast—allowing for them to capture it.
657560	661880	Other airlines around the world have done the same, and the industry, in general, has
661880	664880	become more agile and data-driven.
664880	669160	These will be useful skills for airlines to maintain long into the future as, when
669160	674000	there is demand, a company's excuse should never be that they couldn't act fast enough
674000	675320	to capture it.
675320	679740	Sometimes, though, it's strategic to ignore demand.
679740	685000	On October 6th, American Airlines flew its last flight from Greenville, North Carolina,
685000	687960	for at least a month, but likely longer.
687960	692720	An airline pulling service from a small regional airport in a time of economic crisis is nothing
692720	696360	unexpected, but this case stands out.
696360	701560	The cut was originally announced as only for a month, from October 7th to November 4th—a
701560	705560	date recognizable for its proximity to the November 3rd US election.
705560	710180	There's no reason for an airline to believe that the economic conditions that make a route
710180	715120	unprofitable on October 7th would be resolved by November 4th—if anything, they should
715120	720800	get worse as winter nears, so suspending a route for only one month to save money doesn't
720800	722280	make sense.
722280	728200	In addition, this service suspension was announced along with 14 others impacting 14 small airports
728200	733580	in 14 different states—including Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, and other swing states
733580	735520	in the 2020 election.
735520	740460	Also, many of the states that American Airlines cut service to have incumbent senators who
740460	744360	polling data indicate might lose on November 3rd.
744360	748840	This includes Thom Tillis who, as happens when small airports lose their only commercial
748840	753240	service, immediately faced pressure from his constituents to bring flights back to
753240	754240	Greenville.
754240	758520	American Airlines is essentially playing chicken with the US government.
758520	762940	With CARES Act funding having now expired, airlines desperately want more financial aid
762940	768180	from Congress, and with 15 routes to 15 states cut, there are now 30 senators that have to
768180	773160	answer for why they haven't passed an airline relief bill to help save the small town's
773160	774240	service.
774240	778440	In the end, three of these suspensions didn't go through, but most others were extended
778440	782280	another month, thereby ratcheting up the pressure on Congress by signaling that these
782280	787200	temporary suspensions might not be so temporary if they don't get the relief they say they
787200	788200	need.
788200	792040	While in the US and elsewhere, airlines' continued survival is increasingly linked
792040	795520	to politics, in other places, it's always been.
795520	800840	China's aviation recovery has played a key part in the country's narrative of overall
800840	804600	recovery, which is, at least compared to other places, genuine.
804600	810160	On August 28th, Chengdu Airlines flight 2712 was the first to leave from the airport that,
810160	814660	eight months earlier, undoubtedly played a central role in spreading the virus across
814660	817960	the globe—Wuhan Tianhe International.
817960	822880	This flight, though, was the first of hundreds to leave Wuhan that day, and that day, in
822880	828120	fact, was the first when the number of flights in the country reached 100% relative to January
828120	829840	1st of the same year.
830280	836040	China's aviation recovery was fast, in part because China's virus recovery was fast.
836040	839840	The country's airlines are not completely back to normal yet—their load factors and
839840	844560	fares are lower than before and their international market is still nearly non-existent—but
844560	848640	China's airlines, along with those of New Zealand, Australia, and all the other countries
848640	854040	that have successfully curbed the virus, demonstrate that the economic crisis cannot end until
854040	859040	the public health crisis does, and therefore, no matter which one cares about more, the
859040	864160	route to recovery always starts with health.
864160	869440	The YouTube algorithm, as any creator knows, is optimized for one thing—keeping the average
869440	874620	person on the platform for the longest time—but for us in the educational niche, our audience
874620	877520	likes different things than the average YouTube viewer.
877520	881480	We know what our audience wants, but sometimes that doesn't line up with the stuff that
881480	883400	the YouTube algorithm will favor.
883400	888200	For example, I wanted to make this video longer, but I had to keep it within the key 10-15
888200	890960	at length so that performance didn't tank.
890960	895480	Instead, I've cut it down from covering ten flights to just eight, and put an extended
895480	900000	version with what I thought were the least important of the ten on Nebula.
