5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,720
There was a time, earlier in 2020, when there was no news but COVID news.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,520
There was this time when every word, of every story, of every front page, of every paper,

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,360
either directly or indirectly dealt with the coronavirus, but now, many months on, that

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,800
is no longer the case.

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,160
The world has awoken in a way that there is more of relevance.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:49,260
However, in certain circles, in those most dramatically impacted, COVID is still everything.

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,480
That is certainly the case in aviation.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,420
Almost nothing they do nowadays is not dictated by the ever-present backdrop of the centuries

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,460
first pandemic.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,580
Most of what anyone has been talking about recently, including us, has been on how this

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,800
will fundamentally change the industry—on how the airline of 2029 will look markedly

16
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,540
different than that of 2019.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:17,220
Today, though, in October 2020, we're nearing the one-year mark since when SARS-CoV-2 is

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,000
believed to have made the jump from animal to human.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,280
With this amount of time behind us, the airline industry has already changed.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,200
The airline of October 2020 is already different than the airline of October 2019.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,620
So, to see what's happened already, we're going to look at eight flights that, for reasons

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,940
either big or small, would have been considered strange, unique, or even unimaginable just

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,600
a year ago today, but now are nothing out of the ordinary.

24
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,800
We'll start with the end for one aircraft—at least for a while.

25
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,620
On September 25th, Qantas's VH-OQI, an A380, flew from Dresden, Germany to Victorville,

26
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,160
California—a route that is quite clearly unordinary for an airline based in Australia,

27
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,360
but it's not the route that made this notable.

28
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,840
VH-OQI had been flown to Dresden in March for cabin refurbishment.

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,920
By September, though, it became clear that not only was the refurbishment unnecessary,

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,160
but that the aircraft was too.

31
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,640
Therefore, the decision was made to put this fleet of aircraft into long-term storage,

32
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
and this particular flight from Dresden would mark the last time a Qantas A380 would be

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,160
airborne until at least 2023.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,960
This demonstrates that this is the soonest Qantas believes passenger demand could return

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,480
to 2019 levels—when the A380 served as its flagship aircraft.

36
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,520
However, the fact specifically that the airline would bother storing the aircraft, rather

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,460
than scrapping or selling it, also marks a hint of optimism.

38
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,400
Long-term aircraft storage is not cheap—it involves quite regular maintenance and monitoring,

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,320
and so this means that Qantas does truly believe that demand will return to the levels of before—an

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,480
opinion not held by all.

41
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,420
Qantas desperately needs every dollar they can get right now, so they would only spend

42
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,760
money on keeping their A380s if they truly believed that there was a significant need

43
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,000
for super-large aircraft in the medium-term future.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,560
Therefore, while it's plenty easy to find negative signs for the future of aviation,

45
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,960
this flight does represent a belief that the good times will return, for airlines.

46
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:30,260
This next flight, meanwhile, didn't, and in some ways couldn't, exist a year ago.

47
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,520
On October 8th, Southwest Flight 1920 flew from Phoenix, Arizona to San Jose del Cabo,

48
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Mexico.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,360
This certainly looks like a fairly normal flight—just another big city to resort town

50
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,860
route—but the backstory behind it explains its peculiarity.

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,400
Mexico is one of the few major countries that has not restricted entry to Americans, so,

52
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,560
when the US emerged from lockdown in May and June, Cabo was one of the first international

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,740
destinations added back to Southwest's network.

54
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:04,100
This is, without a doubt, due to the fact that it's both open to Americans and, crucially,

55
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,120
a leisure destination.

56
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,360
Airplane demand is traditionally split into leisure and business, and these two segments

57
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,680
have had very different stories of recovery.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,160
Leisure demand picked up quickly and sharply as soon as stay-at-home orders lifted, while

59
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,280
business demand has barely increased at all.

60
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,200
This is no surprise considering that, overwhelmingly, offices are still closed, conferences are

61
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,440
still cancelled, and clients are still cautious.

62
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,260
Therefore, airlines have had to respond by removing capacity from where people travel

63
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,180
for work and adding it to where people travel for vacation, such as Cabo.

64
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,500
Right now, there's a huge amount of capacity being dumped into the Florida and Mexico markets.

65
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:49,380
For example, in the coming winter, there are 24 flights a week scheduled between New York

66
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,960
and Cabo versus just two a week last winter.

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,620
Some leisure destinations have not only recovered faster, but have come out ahead versus how

68
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,260
they were before.

69
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,420
This is certainly the case with Cabo, and the October 8th flight from Phoenix represented

70
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,860
the first of many, with Southwest adding this city pair to their network.

71
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,960
Overall, leisure is winning, business is losing, and therefore airlines that have historically

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,180
been more leisure-oriented, like Southwest, have fared far better than their more business-oriented

73
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,940
competitors.

74
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:24,100
One of those more business-oriented competitors is United, which announced this new route

75
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,220
from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Fort Myers, Florida.

76
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,340
Much like Southwest's flight, this probably doesn't seem that strange, but for United,

77
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,080
it's a dramatic deviation from the mean.

78
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,260
You see, like most legacy carriers, United has traditionally been a strict follower of

79
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,300
the hub-and-spoke school of network planning.

80
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,620
Every single flight they fly, with very limited exception, either originates or terminates

81
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,820
in DC, Newark, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Guam—their hub

82
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,180
airports.

83
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,780
This flight, though, along with a whole package of others announced at the same time, does

84
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
not.

85
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,480
United wouldn't break from precedent without a good reason, and so this must mean something.

86
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,100
Most likely, it indicates a mix of desperation and innovation—desperation because they're

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,600
now seriously competing on leisure routes, something they avoided before, and innovation

88
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,540
because United is reinventing its network design and getting a little more creative.

89
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,420
Creativity and innovation is what pushes an industry forward, and so, even if it comes

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,620
in the form of a route that is just ever so slightly different, it demonstrates a characteristic

91
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,980
that would be welcome once the downturn is over.

92
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,920
Airlines are now willing to find revenue wherever it might be, whereas in the past they might

93
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:48,740
have only chosen to pursue the most profitable form of revenue, so this flight—UA-2861,

94
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,380
from Guam to Singapore on a 787—is another that could never have existed a year ago.

95
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,420
Now, Guam is a United hub, but it's never had flights to Singapore, definitely never

96
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:06,060
had these on a 787, and absolutely never operated them without passengers, and yet now, four

97
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,380
times a week, they are.

98
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,720
With the current lack in long-haul flights, which traditionally carry freight in their

99
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,440
belly holds, global cargo capacity is down, meaning prices are up, meaning airplanes can

100
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,740
reliably turn a slight profit flying passenger airplanes without passengers.

101
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,120
In a matter of months, United has turned its Guam hub essentially into a mini cargo

102
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,500
hub, with regular flights stopping over from the US, going on to Asian destinations.

103
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,300
Beyond this, globally, United now operates hundreds of cargo-only flights per week, even

104
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,780
though one year ago, it didn't operate a single one.

105
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,380
Whether it'll turn Guam into a major passenger hub for the US-to-Asia market is an unanswerable

106
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,060
question right now, but at the very least, this further demonstrates how airlines will

107
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,580
truly take any revenue they can get, even if it involves turning into a cargo airline

108
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,980
in a matter of months.

109
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,900
Revenue is, of course, half of the equation for profitability, but the other part is,

110
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,780
of course, costs.

111
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,140
Therefore, for weathering this crisis, airlines need to get as much revenue as possible, while

112
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,420
also minimizing cost.

113
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:16,260
This American Airlines flight from Eagle County Airport to Aspen was not about bringing in

114
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,140
revenue, but rather about reducing costs.

115
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:25,060
You see, only 29 miles or 46 kilometers separate these two airports, meaning nobody's really

116
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,020
looking to fly between them.

117
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,180
However, this flight was part of an overall flight that went from Dallas to Eagle County

118
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:35,840
to Aspen to Montrose and back to Dallas, meaning a passenger going to Montrose would have to

119
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,220
sit through at least two stops.

120
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,100
Now, a passenger is much more likely to take a one-stop itinerary than a two, so in a time

121
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,140
when American Airlines is fighting for every customer it can get, why would it fly such

122
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,740
a clearly uncompetitive itinerary?

123
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,340
Well, the reason is that American didn't really care how many people took this flight,

124
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,100
because it was always going to be very close to none.

125
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,640
They couldn't, however, just cancel it, because airlines in the US received a package

126
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,180
of financial aid from the government in exchange for, among other things, agreeing to continue

127
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,580
serving every airport they did previously.

128
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,980
American had previously served these three airports which primarily act as entry points

129
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,100
for tourist towns—each of which implemented restrictions preventing visitors during their

130
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,660
stay-at-home periods.

131
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,300
This meant demand for traveling to these places was essentially zero—in the case of Aspen

132
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,660
in May, for example, just 7% of American's seats were filled.

133
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,300
Therefore, instead of operating three different empty flights, they rather operated just one

134
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,680
that stopped at each of the three airports, thereby creating that 29-mile flight which

135
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,880
was, at the time, the shortest commercial flight in America.

136
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,520
Until the CARES Act expired on October 1st, American and other airlines found ways to

137
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,640
both stay loyal to their new masters in the government while also minimizing costs to

138
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,360
the lowest level.

139
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,920
But back on the revenue side, on September 25th, Qantas operated QF 1570 from Canberra

140
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,000
to Gold Coast Airport in Australia.

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,320
Exactly one week earlier, on September 18th, Queensland, the state that the Gold Coast

142
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,420
is in, announced that it was opening its borders to the Australian Capital Territory,

143
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,260
the territory that Canberra is in.

144
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:17,400
That very same day, Qantas announced that it would start a new route between these two

145
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,880
airports one week later.

146
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:25,760
Now, normally, when airlines announce new routes, they do so months or even years in

147
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
advance.

148
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,120
For example, when Qantas announced a new route from Brisbane to Chicago, originally slated

149
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,200
to start in April 2020 but now pushed back, they did so in July 2019—a full eight months

150
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,380
in advance.

151
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,720
To shorten this to one week is unprecedented, but with borders opening and closing at a

152
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,040
moment's notice, predicting demand has become incredibly tough.

153
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,520
So, in this case, Qantas saw that demand for travel to Queensland was going to surge and

154
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:57,560
they were able to respond lightning fast—allowing for them to capture it.

155
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,880
Other airlines around the world have done the same, and the industry, in general, has

156
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
become more agile and data-driven.

157
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,160
These will be useful skills for airlines to maintain long into the future as, when

158
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,000
there is demand, a company's excuse should never be that they couldn't act fast enough

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,320
to capture it.

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,740
Sometimes, though, it's strategic to ignore demand.

161
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,000
On October 6th, American Airlines flew its last flight from Greenville, North Carolina,

162
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,960
for at least a month, but likely longer.

163
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,720
An airline pulling service from a small regional airport in a time of economic crisis is nothing

164
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,360
unexpected, but this case stands out.

165
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,560
The cut was originally announced as only for a month, from October 7th to November 4th—a

166
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,560
date recognizable for its proximity to the November 3rd US election.

167
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,180
There's no reason for an airline to believe that the economic conditions that make a route

168
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,120
unprofitable on October 7th would be resolved by November 4th—if anything, they should

169
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,800
get worse as winter nears, so suspending a route for only one month to save money doesn't

170
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,280
make sense.

171
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,200
In addition, this service suspension was announced along with 14 others impacting 14 small airports

172
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,580
in 14 different states—including Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, and other swing states

173
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,520
in the 2020 election.

174
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,460
Also, many of the states that American Airlines cut service to have incumbent senators who

175
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,360
polling data indicate might lose on November 3rd.

176
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,840
This includes Thom Tillis who, as happens when small airports lose their only commercial

177
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,240
service, immediately faced pressure from his constituents to bring flights back to

178
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
Greenville.

179
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,520
American Airlines is essentially playing chicken with the US government.

180
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,940
With CARES Act funding having now expired, airlines desperately want more financial aid

181
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:48,180
from Congress, and with 15 routes to 15 states cut, there are now 30 senators that have to

182
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,160
answer for why they haven't passed an airline relief bill to help save the small town's

183
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,240
service.

184
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,440
In the end, three of these suspensions didn't go through, but most others were extended

185
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,280
another month, thereby ratcheting up the pressure on Congress by signaling that these

186
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,200
temporary suspensions might not be so temporary if they don't get the relief they say they

187
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
need.

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,040
While in the US and elsewhere, airlines' continued survival is increasingly linked

189
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,520
to politics, in other places, it's always been.

190
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,840
China's aviation recovery has played a key part in the country's narrative of overall

191
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,600
recovery, which is, at least compared to other places, genuine.

192
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,160
On August 28th, Chengdu Airlines flight 2712 was the first to leave from the airport that,

193
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,660
eight months earlier, undoubtedly played a central role in spreading the virus across

194
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,960
the globe—Wuhan Tianhe International.

195
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,880
This flight, though, was the first of hundreds to leave Wuhan that day, and that day, in

196
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,120
fact, was the first when the number of flights in the country reached 100% relative to January

197
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,840
1st of the same year.

198
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:56,040
China's aviation recovery was fast, in part because China's virus recovery was fast.

199
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,840
The country's airlines are not completely back to normal yet—their load factors and

200
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,560
fares are lower than before and their international market is still nearly non-existent—but

201
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,640
China's airlines, along with those of New Zealand, Australia, and all the other countries

202
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,040
that have successfully curbed the virus, demonstrate that the economic crisis cannot end until

203
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,040
the public health crisis does, and therefore, no matter which one cares about more, the

204
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,160
route to recovery always starts with health.

205
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,440
The YouTube algorithm, as any creator knows, is optimized for one thing—keeping the average

206
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,620
person on the platform for the longest time—but for us in the educational niche, our audience

207
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:37,520
likes different things than the average YouTube viewer.

208
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,480
We know what our audience wants, but sometimes that doesn't line up with the stuff that

209
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,400
the YouTube algorithm will favor.

210
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,200
For example, I wanted to make this video longer, but I had to keep it within the key 10-15

211
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,960
at length so that performance didn't tank.

212
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,480
Instead, I've cut it down from covering ten flights to just eight, and put an extended

213
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,000
version with what I thought were the least important of the ten on Nebula.

214
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,160
This is just one of the many pieces of exclusive content you can get on there, including Showmakers,

215
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,760
the podcast from Real Engineering and myself, where we interview other great creators such

216
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,000
as Stephanie from Real Science or Evan from Polymatter, or our next Nebula original, which

217
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,160
we're putting the final touches on currently and will release in a few weeks.

218
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,920
Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula is through the CuriosityStream bundle

219
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,580
deal, which also gives you access to all their thousands of truly interesting documentaries

220
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,440
and non-fiction shows, which each entertain and educate.

221
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,880
Together, CuriosityStream and Nebula represent the best deal in streaming because, at $15

222
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,640
a year, it's the same price as a month at other single streaming services, so make sure

223
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,080
to sign up before the current sale pricing is over at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

224
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
