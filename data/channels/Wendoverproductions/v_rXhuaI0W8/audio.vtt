00:16.300 --> 00:21.720
There was a time, earlier in 2020, when there was no news but COVID news.

00:21.720 --> 00:27.520
There was this time when every word, of every story, of every front page, of every paper,

00:27.520 --> 00:34.360
either directly or indirectly dealt with the coronavirus, but now, many months on, that

00:34.360 --> 00:36.800
is no longer the case.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.160
The world has awoken in a way that there is more of relevance.

00:41.160 --> 00:49.260
However, in certain circles, in those most dramatically impacted, COVID is still everything.

00:49.260 --> 00:52.480
That is certainly the case in aviation.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.420
Almost nothing they do nowadays is not dictated by the ever-present backdrop of the centuries

00:57.420 --> 00:59.460
first pandemic.

00:59.460 --> 01:03.580
Most of what anyone has been talking about recently, including us, has been on how this

01:03.580 --> 01:08.800
will fundamentally change the industry—on how the airline of 2029 will look markedly

01:08.800 --> 01:10.540
different than that of 2019.

01:10.540 --> 01:17.220
Today, though, in October 2020, we're nearing the one-year mark since when SARS-CoV-2 is

01:17.220 --> 01:20.000
believed to have made the jump from animal to human.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.280
With this amount of time behind us, the airline industry has already changed.

01:25.280 --> 01:31.200
The airline of October 2020 is already different than the airline of October 2019.

01:31.200 --> 01:36.620
So, to see what's happened already, we're going to look at eight flights that, for reasons

01:36.620 --> 01:41.940
either big or small, would have been considered strange, unique, or even unimaginable just

01:41.940 --> 01:46.600
a year ago today, but now are nothing out of the ordinary.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.800
We'll start with the end for one aircraft—at least for a while.

01:51.800 --> 01:57.620
On September 25th, Qantas's VH-OQI, an A380, flew from Dresden, Germany to Victorville,

01:57.620 --> 02:03.160
California—a route that is quite clearly unordinary for an airline based in Australia,

02:03.160 --> 02:06.360
but it's not the route that made this notable.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.840
VH-OQI had been flown to Dresden in March for cabin refurbishment.

02:10.840 --> 02:15.920
By September, though, it became clear that not only was the refurbishment unnecessary,

02:15.920 --> 02:18.160
but that the aircraft was too.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.640
Therefore, the decision was made to put this fleet of aircraft into long-term storage,

02:22.640 --> 02:27.120
and this particular flight from Dresden would mark the last time a Qantas A380 would be

02:27.120 --> 02:31.160
airborne until at least 2023.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.960
This demonstrates that this is the soonest Qantas believes passenger demand could return

02:35.960 --> 02:40.480
to 2019 levels—when the A380 served as its flagship aircraft.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.520
However, the fact specifically that the airline would bother storing the aircraft, rather

02:45.520 --> 02:50.460
than scrapping or selling it, also marks a hint of optimism.

02:50.460 --> 02:55.400
Long-term aircraft storage is not cheap—it involves quite regular maintenance and monitoring,

02:55.400 --> 03:01.320
and so this means that Qantas does truly believe that demand will return to the levels of before—an

03:01.320 --> 03:03.480
opinion not held by all.

03:03.480 --> 03:07.420
Qantas desperately needs every dollar they can get right now, so they would only spend

03:07.420 --> 03:11.760
money on keeping their A380s if they truly believed that there was a significant need

03:11.760 --> 03:15.000
for super-large aircraft in the medium-term future.

03:15.000 --> 03:19.560
Therefore, while it's plenty easy to find negative signs for the future of aviation,

03:19.560 --> 03:24.960
this flight does represent a belief that the good times will return, for airlines.

03:24.960 --> 03:30.260
This next flight, meanwhile, didn't, and in some ways couldn't, exist a year ago.

03:30.260 --> 03:35.520
On October 8th, Southwest Flight 1920 flew from Phoenix, Arizona to San Jose del Cabo,

03:35.520 --> 03:36.520
Mexico.

03:36.520 --> 03:40.360
This certainly looks like a fairly normal flight—just another big city to resort town

03:40.360 --> 03:44.860
route—but the backstory behind it explains its peculiarity.

03:44.860 --> 03:50.400
Mexico is one of the few major countries that has not restricted entry to Americans, so,

03:50.400 --> 03:55.560
when the US emerged from lockdown in May and June, Cabo was one of the first international

03:55.560 --> 03:58.740
destinations added back to Southwest's network.

03:58.740 --> 04:04.100
This is, without a doubt, due to the fact that it's both open to Americans and, crucially,

04:04.100 --> 04:06.120
a leisure destination.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.360
Airplane demand is traditionally split into leisure and business, and these two segments

04:10.360 --> 04:13.680
have had very different stories of recovery.

04:13.680 --> 04:19.160
Leisure demand picked up quickly and sharply as soon as stay-at-home orders lifted, while

04:19.160 --> 04:22.280
business demand has barely increased at all.

04:22.280 --> 04:27.200
This is no surprise considering that, overwhelmingly, offices are still closed, conferences are

04:27.200 --> 04:30.440
still cancelled, and clients are still cautious.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.260
Therefore, airlines have had to respond by removing capacity from where people travel

04:34.260 --> 04:39.180
for work and adding it to where people travel for vacation, such as Cabo.

04:39.180 --> 04:44.500
Right now, there's a huge amount of capacity being dumped into the Florida and Mexico markets.

04:44.500 --> 04:49.380
For example, in the coming winter, there are 24 flights a week scheduled between New York

04:49.380 --> 04:52.960
and Cabo versus just two a week last winter.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.620
Some leisure destinations have not only recovered faster, but have come out ahead versus how

04:57.620 --> 04:59.260
they were before.

04:59.260 --> 05:03.420
This is certainly the case with Cabo, and the October 8th flight from Phoenix represented

05:03.420 --> 05:07.860
the first of many, with Southwest adding this city pair to their network.

05:07.860 --> 05:12.960
Overall, leisure is winning, business is losing, and therefore airlines that have historically

05:12.960 --> 05:18.180
been more leisure-oriented, like Southwest, have fared far better than their more business-oriented

05:18.180 --> 05:19.940
competitors.

05:19.940 --> 05:24.100
One of those more business-oriented competitors is United, which announced this new route

05:24.100 --> 05:27.220
from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Fort Myers, Florida.

05:27.220 --> 05:32.340
Much like Southwest's flight, this probably doesn't seem that strange, but for United,

05:32.340 --> 05:36.080
it's a dramatic deviation from the mean.

05:36.080 --> 05:41.260
You see, like most legacy carriers, United has traditionally been a strict follower of

05:41.260 --> 05:44.300
the hub-and-spoke school of network planning.

05:44.300 --> 05:49.620
Every single flight they fly, with very limited exception, either originates or terminates

05:49.620 --> 05:55.820
in DC, Newark, Chicago, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, or Guam—their hub

05:55.820 --> 05:57.180
airports.

05:57.180 --> 06:01.780
This flight, though, along with a whole package of others announced at the same time, does

06:01.780 --> 06:02.780
not.

06:02.780 --> 06:08.480
United wouldn't break from precedent without a good reason, and so this must mean something.

06:08.480 --> 06:14.100
Most likely, it indicates a mix of desperation and innovation—desperation because they're

06:14.100 --> 06:18.600
now seriously competing on leisure routes, something they avoided before, and innovation

06:18.600 --> 06:24.540
because United is reinventing its network design and getting a little more creative.

06:24.540 --> 06:29.420
Creativity and innovation is what pushes an industry forward, and so, even if it comes

06:29.420 --> 06:34.620
in the form of a route that is just ever so slightly different, it demonstrates a characteristic

06:34.620 --> 06:38.980
that would be welcome once the downturn is over.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.920
Airlines are now willing to find revenue wherever it might be, whereas in the past they might

06:42.920 --> 06:48.740
have only chosen to pursue the most profitable form of revenue, so this flight—UA-2861,

06:48.740 --> 06:54.380
from Guam to Singapore on a 787—is another that could never have existed a year ago.

06:54.380 --> 06:59.420
Now, Guam is a United hub, but it's never had flights to Singapore, definitely never

06:59.420 --> 07:06.060
had these on a 787, and absolutely never operated them without passengers, and yet now, four

07:06.060 --> 07:08.380
times a week, they are.

07:08.380 --> 07:11.720
With the current lack in long-haul flights, which traditionally carry freight in their

07:11.720 --> 07:16.440
belly holds, global cargo capacity is down, meaning prices are up, meaning airplanes can

07:16.440 --> 07:21.740
reliably turn a slight profit flying passenger airplanes without passengers.

07:21.740 --> 07:26.120
In a matter of months, United has turned its Guam hub essentially into a mini cargo

07:26.120 --> 07:31.500
hub, with regular flights stopping over from the US, going on to Asian destinations.

07:31.500 --> 07:37.300
Beyond this, globally, United now operates hundreds of cargo-only flights per week, even

07:37.300 --> 07:40.780
though one year ago, it didn't operate a single one.

07:40.780 --> 07:45.380
Whether it'll turn Guam into a major passenger hub for the US-to-Asia market is an unanswerable

07:45.380 --> 07:50.060
question right now, but at the very least, this further demonstrates how airlines will

07:50.060 --> 07:54.580
truly take any revenue they can get, even if it involves turning into a cargo airline

07:54.580 --> 07:56.980
in a matter of months.

07:56.980 --> 08:01.900
Revenue is, of course, half of the equation for profitability, but the other part is,

08:01.900 --> 08:03.780
of course, costs.

08:03.780 --> 08:09.140
Therefore, for weathering this crisis, airlines need to get as much revenue as possible, while

08:09.140 --> 08:11.420
also minimizing cost.

08:11.420 --> 08:16.260
This American Airlines flight from Eagle County Airport to Aspen was not about bringing in

08:16.260 --> 08:19.140
revenue, but rather about reducing costs.

08:19.140 --> 08:25.060
You see, only 29 miles or 46 kilometers separate these two airports, meaning nobody's really

08:25.060 --> 08:27.020
looking to fly between them.

08:27.020 --> 08:31.180
However, this flight was part of an overall flight that went from Dallas to Eagle County

08:31.180 --> 08:35.840
to Aspen to Montrose and back to Dallas, meaning a passenger going to Montrose would have to

08:35.840 --> 08:38.220
sit through at least two stops.

08:38.220 --> 08:44.100
Now, a passenger is much more likely to take a one-stop itinerary than a two, so in a time

08:44.100 --> 08:49.140
when American Airlines is fighting for every customer it can get, why would it fly such

08:49.140 --> 08:51.740
a clearly uncompetitive itinerary?

08:51.740 --> 08:56.340
Well, the reason is that American didn't really care how many people took this flight,

08:56.340 --> 08:59.100
because it was always going to be very close to none.

08:59.100 --> 09:03.640
They couldn't, however, just cancel it, because airlines in the US received a package

09:03.640 --> 09:08.180
of financial aid from the government in exchange for, among other things, agreeing to continue

09:08.180 --> 09:11.580
serving every airport they did previously.

09:11.580 --> 09:15.980
American had previously served these three airports which primarily act as entry points

09:15.980 --> 09:20.100
for tourist towns—each of which implemented restrictions preventing visitors during their

09:20.100 --> 09:21.660
stay-at-home periods.

09:21.660 --> 09:26.300
This meant demand for traveling to these places was essentially zero—in the case of Aspen

09:26.300 --> 09:30.660
in May, for example, just 7% of American's seats were filled.

09:30.660 --> 09:35.300
Therefore, instead of operating three different empty flights, they rather operated just one

09:35.300 --> 09:39.680
that stopped at each of the three airports, thereby creating that 29-mile flight which

09:39.680 --> 09:43.880
was, at the time, the shortest commercial flight in America.

09:43.880 --> 09:48.520
Until the CARES Act expired on October 1st, American and other airlines found ways to

09:48.520 --> 09:52.640
both stay loyal to their new masters in the government while also minimizing costs to

09:52.640 --> 09:54.360
the lowest level.

09:54.360 --> 09:59.920
But back on the revenue side, on September 25th, Qantas operated QF 1570 from Canberra

09:59.920 --> 10:03.000
to Gold Coast Airport in Australia.

10:03.000 --> 10:07.320
Exactly one week earlier, on September 18th, Queensland, the state that the Gold Coast

10:07.320 --> 10:11.420
is in, announced that it was opening its borders to the Australian Capital Territory,

10:11.420 --> 10:13.260
the territory that Canberra is in.

10:13.260 --> 10:17.400
That very same day, Qantas announced that it would start a new route between these two

10:17.400 --> 10:19.880
airports one week later.

10:19.880 --> 10:25.760
Now, normally, when airlines announce new routes, they do so months or even years in

10:25.760 --> 10:26.760
advance.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.120
For example, when Qantas announced a new route from Brisbane to Chicago, originally slated

10:31.120 --> 10:37.200
to start in April 2020 but now pushed back, they did so in July 2019—a full eight months

10:37.200 --> 10:38.380
in advance.

10:38.380 --> 10:42.720
To shorten this to one week is unprecedented, but with borders opening and closing at a

10:42.720 --> 10:47.040
moment's notice, predicting demand has become incredibly tough.

10:47.040 --> 10:52.520
So, in this case, Qantas saw that demand for travel to Queensland was going to surge and

10:52.520 --> 10:57.560
they were able to respond lightning fast—allowing for them to capture it.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.880
Other airlines around the world have done the same, and the industry, in general, has

11:01.880 --> 11:04.880
become more agile and data-driven.

11:04.880 --> 11:09.160
These will be useful skills for airlines to maintain long into the future as, when

11:09.160 --> 11:14.000
there is demand, a company's excuse should never be that they couldn't act fast enough

11:14.000 --> 11:15.320
to capture it.

11:15.320 --> 11:19.740
Sometimes, though, it's strategic to ignore demand.

11:19.740 --> 11:25.000
On October 6th, American Airlines flew its last flight from Greenville, North Carolina,

11:25.000 --> 11:27.960
for at least a month, but likely longer.

11:27.960 --> 11:32.720
An airline pulling service from a small regional airport in a time of economic crisis is nothing

11:32.720 --> 11:36.360
unexpected, but this case stands out.

11:36.360 --> 11:41.560
The cut was originally announced as only for a month, from October 7th to November 4th—a

11:41.560 --> 11:45.560
date recognizable for its proximity to the November 3rd US election.

11:45.560 --> 11:50.180
There's no reason for an airline to believe that the economic conditions that make a route

11:50.180 --> 11:55.120
unprofitable on October 7th would be resolved by November 4th—if anything, they should

11:55.120 --> 12:00.800
get worse as winter nears, so suspending a route for only one month to save money doesn't

12:00.800 --> 12:02.280
make sense.

12:02.280 --> 12:08.200
In addition, this service suspension was announced along with 14 others impacting 14 small airports

12:08.200 --> 12:13.580
in 14 different states—including Pennsylvania, Iowa, North Carolina, and other swing states

12:13.580 --> 12:15.520
in the 2020 election.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.460
Also, many of the states that American Airlines cut service to have incumbent senators who

12:20.460 --> 12:24.360
polling data indicate might lose on November 3rd.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.840
This includes Thom Tillis who, as happens when small airports lose their only commercial

12:28.840 --> 12:33.240
service, immediately faced pressure from his constituents to bring flights back to

12:33.240 --> 12:34.240
Greenville.

12:34.240 --> 12:38.520
American Airlines is essentially playing chicken with the US government.

12:38.520 --> 12:42.940
With CARES Act funding having now expired, airlines desperately want more financial aid

12:42.940 --> 12:48.180
from Congress, and with 15 routes to 15 states cut, there are now 30 senators that have to

12:48.180 --> 12:53.160
answer for why they haven't passed an airline relief bill to help save the small town's

12:53.160 --> 12:54.240
service.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.440
In the end, three of these suspensions didn't go through, but most others were extended

12:58.440 --> 13:02.280
another month, thereby ratcheting up the pressure on Congress by signaling that these

13:02.280 --> 13:07.200
temporary suspensions might not be so temporary if they don't get the relief they say they

13:07.200 --> 13:08.200
need.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.040
While in the US and elsewhere, airlines' continued survival is increasingly linked

13:12.040 --> 13:15.520
to politics, in other places, it's always been.

13:15.520 --> 13:20.840
China's aviation recovery has played a key part in the country's narrative of overall

13:20.840 --> 13:24.600
recovery, which is, at least compared to other places, genuine.

13:24.600 --> 13:30.160
On August 28th, Chengdu Airlines flight 2712 was the first to leave from the airport that,

13:30.160 --> 13:34.660
eight months earlier, undoubtedly played a central role in spreading the virus across

13:34.660 --> 13:37.960
the globe—Wuhan Tianhe International.

13:37.960 --> 13:42.880
This flight, though, was the first of hundreds to leave Wuhan that day, and that day, in

13:42.880 --> 13:48.120
fact, was the first when the number of flights in the country reached 100% relative to January

13:48.120 --> 13:49.840
1st of the same year.

13:50.280 --> 13:56.040
China's aviation recovery was fast, in part because China's virus recovery was fast.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.840
The country's airlines are not completely back to normal yet—their load factors and

13:59.840 --> 14:04.560
fares are lower than before and their international market is still nearly non-existent—but

14:04.560 --> 14:08.640
China's airlines, along with those of New Zealand, Australia, and all the other countries

14:08.640 --> 14:14.040
that have successfully curbed the virus, demonstrate that the economic crisis cannot end until

14:14.040 --> 14:19.040
the public health crisis does, and therefore, no matter which one cares about more, the

14:19.040 --> 14:24.160
route to recovery always starts with health.

14:24.160 --> 14:29.440
The YouTube algorithm, as any creator knows, is optimized for one thing—keeping the average

14:29.440 --> 14:34.620
person on the platform for the longest time—but for us in the educational niche, our audience

14:34.620 --> 14:37.520
likes different things than the average YouTube viewer.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.480
We know what our audience wants, but sometimes that doesn't line up with the stuff that

14:41.480 --> 14:43.400
the YouTube algorithm will favor.

14:43.400 --> 14:48.200
For example, I wanted to make this video longer, but I had to keep it within the key 10-15

14:48.200 --> 14:50.960
at length so that performance didn't tank.

14:50.960 --> 14:55.480
Instead, I've cut it down from covering ten flights to just eight, and put an extended

14:55.480 --> 15:00.000
version with what I thought were the least important of the ten on Nebula.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.160
This is just one of the many pieces of exclusive content you can get on there, including Showmakers,

15:05.160 --> 15:08.760
the podcast from Real Engineering and myself, where we interview other great creators such

15:08.760 --> 15:13.000
as Stephanie from Real Science or Evan from Polymatter, or our next Nebula original, which

15:13.000 --> 15:17.160
we're putting the final touches on currently and will release in a few weeks.

15:17.160 --> 15:20.920
Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula is through the CuriosityStream bundle

15:20.920 --> 15:25.580
deal, which also gives you access to all their thousands of truly interesting documentaries

15:25.580 --> 15:29.440
and non-fiction shows, which each entertain and educate.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.880
Together, CuriosityStream and Nebula represent the best deal in streaming because, at $15

15:34.880 --> 15:39.640
a year, it's the same price as a month at other single streaming services, so make sure

15:39.640 --> 15:45.080
to sign up before the current sale pricing is over at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.160
Thank you very much.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.160
Thank you.

15:49.160 --> 15:49.660
Thank you.
