00:00.000 --> 00:05.980
Remember this, remember that moment in April of 2020 when the oil market made headlines,

00:05.980 --> 00:10.480
when the value of West Texas intermediate futures plummeted 300%, when the cost of a

00:10.480 --> 00:17.640
barrel hit $0, then went below zero, then closed the day at negative $37.62?

00:17.640 --> 00:21.880
Maybe you don't—it was a never-before-seen moment nestled between countless never-before-seen

00:21.880 --> 00:27.240
moments—but this moment created this one—oil futures trading at the highest levels in a

00:27.240 --> 00:30.760
decade, gas prices at an all-time high.

00:30.760 --> 00:36.240
The worst day in the oil market's history is responsible for ushering in a new era of

00:36.240 --> 00:38.680
record industry profits.

00:38.680 --> 00:43.080
In the wake of a singular crash, and looking down the barrel of the industry's most existential

00:43.080 --> 00:49.160
threat to date, oil and gas has found a new way to extract more money than ever from the

00:49.160 --> 00:50.160
earth.

00:50.160 --> 00:55.940
The era of scarcity is here, and oil's old ways are over.

00:55.940 --> 01:00.700
Three decades ago, Azerbaijan found itself in front of opportunity.

01:00.700 --> 01:05.380
With the end of August 1991 came the start of the independent Republic of Azerbaijan

01:05.380 --> 01:10.560
as the Soviet Union shed yet another one of its states, and the Iron Curtain rose to reveal

01:10.560 --> 01:13.540
a massive reservoir of oil.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.600
Laying beneath the Caspian was one of the biggest opportunities ever presented to the

01:17.600 --> 01:19.560
Western oil and gas industry.

01:19.560 --> 01:24.360
For decades up until that point, the USSR had been the world's largest oil producer,

01:24.360 --> 01:29.200
but of increasing ire to the private Western producers was OPEC—a cartel of major Middle

01:29.200 --> 01:33.080
Eastern, African, and South American oil-producing countries.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.800
Collectively, market power swayed increasingly away from Washington, but the Caspian had

01:37.800 --> 01:41.740
the potential to put power of the world's most valuable commodity back into what was

01:41.740 --> 01:44.120
considered more trusted hands.

01:44.120 --> 01:48.480
But simultaneously, if managed poorly, it had the same potential to cement the power

01:48.480 --> 01:51.400
of OPEC or the new Russian state.

01:51.440 --> 01:56.760
So, the starter pistol had sounded, and the scramble of the century began.

01:56.760 --> 02:01.200
Azerbaijan has a history as an oil economy—in fact, in the earliest days of the industry,

02:01.200 --> 02:05.000
the country's exports accounted for more than half of the world's supply, but a lack

02:05.000 --> 02:09.400
of focus and investment by their Soviet rulers had transformed the former power player into

02:09.400 --> 02:12.200
a dilapidated, insignificant producer.

02:12.200 --> 02:15.960
To change that, the nation would need investment—and a lot of it.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.560
Baku Street soon hosted a rotating cast of oil executives and diplomats, all there to

02:20.560 --> 02:24.760
court the government into signing a contract with them, rather than their competitor.

02:24.760 --> 02:29.720
A conclusion came in 1994, when ten companies gathered together to sign what was described

02:29.720 --> 02:34.400
as the contract of the century—they would jointly invest, develop, and operate one of

02:34.400 --> 02:37.900
the most valuable oil fields the world had ever produced.

02:37.900 --> 02:42.360
The supply was set, so now all they needed was a way to sell it.

02:42.360 --> 02:46.400
Despite its name and stature, the Caspian Sea is not truly a sea.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.120
It's an endorheic basin, meaning water flows in, but only evaporates out.

02:51.120 --> 02:56.200
Therefore, crucially, unlike its neighbor the Black Sea, the Caspian has no connection

02:56.200 --> 02:57.440
to the ocean.

02:57.440 --> 03:01.680
Simply loading crude into a tanker and sending it to market was impossible—the consortium

03:01.680 --> 03:03.800
needed another route to market.

03:03.800 --> 03:08.200
For the longest time, Azerbaijan exported oil by loading into rail cars routed west

03:08.200 --> 03:12.500
to the Black Sea, where it would be transferred to tanker ships, but both rail and tanker

03:12.500 --> 03:15.160
took substantial cuts out of the profit.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.320
While rails provide an excellent stopgap during pipeline construction or production

03:18.320 --> 03:23.000
booms, travel along already established infrastructure, and can flexibly ship oil to where the market's

03:23.000 --> 03:25.860
the hottest, they don't come cheap.

03:25.860 --> 03:30.200
Using present-day rates from the US, rail transport adds between $5 and $10 a barrel

03:30.200 --> 03:34.320
in cost, making it two to three times more expensive than by pipeline.

03:34.320 --> 03:37.980
Trains were more accident-prone too, and considering that the outbound oil from the Caspian had

03:37.980 --> 03:42.660
a predetermined origin and destination, the only benefit the consortium gained by transporting

03:42.660 --> 03:46.200
oil from the Caspian to the Black Sea via rail was that it didn't have to front the

03:46.200 --> 03:48.420
cost of building a pipeline.

03:48.420 --> 03:53.420
Like the railways, shipping oil out of the Black Sea on tankers proved workable but inefficient.

03:53.420 --> 03:57.300
While connected to the Mediterranean and the world beyond, navigating the 12th treacherously

03:57.300 --> 04:01.700
tight and winding turns of the Bosporus Strait, linking the Black Sea to the wider world through

04:01.700 --> 04:05.040
the very heart of Istanbul, was less than ideal.

04:05.040 --> 04:09.580
The strait proved too narrow for the increasingly common very large crude carriers capable of

04:09.580 --> 04:13.520
shipping 2 million barrels, while the ever-present risk of a single miscalculation closing the

04:13.520 --> 04:18.860
strait for months and stopping Azerbaijani oil in its tracks loomed over the precarious

04:18.860 --> 04:19.860
operation.

04:19.860 --> 04:24.960
That left one good option—pipeline—the safest, most efficient method of shipping

04:24.960 --> 04:26.460
crude oil.

04:26.460 --> 04:29.820
With minimal operating costs and maintenance requirements, shipping a barrel by pipeline

04:29.820 --> 04:35.000
in the US today only adds about $3 to $5 in cost, varying slightly based on quality of

04:35.000 --> 04:36.660
product and distance traveled.

04:36.740 --> 04:40.900
But while pipelines are incredibly cost-effective once in use, to the extent that the US and

04:40.900 --> 04:46.560
Canada are crossed by 100,000 miles or 160,000 kilometers of them, getting such systems online

04:46.560 --> 04:49.660
represents a major upfront investment.

04:49.660 --> 04:54.300
In a 2016 study, economists estimated that building a modest regional pipeline, 12 inches

04:54.300 --> 04:59.260
or 30 centimeters wide and approximately 200 miles or 320 kilometers in length across mostly

04:59.260 --> 05:07.100
flat land would cost a staggering $1.5 million per mile or $960,000 per kilometer.

05:07.100 --> 05:11.100
Connecting the Caspian Sea to the outside world via pipeline would be anything but a

05:11.100 --> 05:12.520
modest endeavor.

05:12.520 --> 05:16.200
The simplest project, for instance, would have been to reverse an existing pipeline

05:16.200 --> 05:21.440
previously used to supply Azerbaijan to route oil northward into Russia's extensive network,

05:21.440 --> 05:23.980
but the US vehemently opposed this.

05:23.980 --> 05:27.820
That would give Russia even greater influence over Azerbaijan's economy.

05:27.820 --> 05:31.360
Another option, routing through Iran, was briefly floated, but this was quickly shot

05:31.360 --> 05:33.980
down due to geopolitical factors as well.

05:33.980 --> 05:38.620
Therefore, that left the western option, which, too, was undesirable.

05:38.620 --> 05:43.420
Georgia was a geopolitically unstable country composed almost exclusively of rough mountainous

05:43.420 --> 05:46.900
terrain, so building a pipeline through it would be risky and expensive.

05:46.900 --> 05:52.740
But it was also the only option left, so construction started on one of the costliest pipelines

05:52.740 --> 05:53.740
in history.

05:53.740 --> 05:58.380
Then, as it became clear that the Bosporus Strait wasn't viable long-term, they started

05:58.380 --> 06:00.300
building another.

06:00.300 --> 06:05.020
To provide a stable route to market, to get that crucial Mediterranean Sea access, the

06:05.020 --> 06:09.020
consortium would have to build one of the longest oil pipelines in the world over some

06:09.020 --> 06:12.380
of the harshest terrain ever spanned by a pipeline.

06:12.380 --> 06:17.380
The 41-inch, 104-centimeter pipe would have to cross three countries, the towering peaks

06:17.380 --> 06:23.660
of the Caucasus, 1,500 streams and rivers, and 3,000 roads, railways, and utility lines.

06:23.660 --> 06:33.260
Therefore, it came with a stratospheric price tag—inflation-adjusted $5.5 billion—but

06:33.260 --> 06:36.840
the consortium was willing to write this check as it was what was necessary to capture the

06:36.840 --> 06:40.220
massive profit potential of Caspian oil.

06:40.220 --> 06:46.120
But for every 1990s Caspian sea boom, there's a 2021 Permian Basin bust.

06:46.120 --> 06:50.600
For reliant nation-states, this volatility is dangerous.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.080
Volatility though, has been largely countered by cooperation.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.760
Beginning at a Baghdad conference in 1960 attended by officials from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,

06:58.760 --> 07:03.680
Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, major Middle Eastern, African, and South American oil producers

07:03.680 --> 07:09.120
have sought to limit overproduction and price fluctuation by controlling global supply.

07:09.120 --> 07:13.600
Made up of these 13 countries today, OPEC sets oil production quotas to maintain the

07:13.600 --> 07:19.120
organization's position of power and, to the extent they can, set a barrel's price.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.960
The organization does this by relying on each member state's ability to ramp or cut crude

07:22.960 --> 07:27.520
production and the organization's sheer scale—that its members produce 40% of the

07:27.520 --> 07:32.040
world's supply and account for nearly 80% of the world's proven reserves.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.240
While Western producers rely on private companies to navigate the massive booms and busts of

07:36.240 --> 07:41.080
the free market with comparatively limited state influence, OPEC functions as an international

07:41.080 --> 07:46.680
cartel whose structure and geological advantages have proved difficult to circumvent, undermine,

07:46.680 --> 07:47.980
or unseat.

07:47.980 --> 07:53.320
In this context, OPEC introduces a crucial component of oil economics—that the price

07:53.320 --> 07:58.000
per barrel is not exactly dependent on the cost of producing that barrel.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.640
Take 2016, for example.

07:59.640 --> 08:04.180
In a year when West Texas intermediate crude prices plummeted below $40, a mark so low

08:04.180 --> 08:09.200
that OPEC broke convention by welcoming Russia into OPEC+, and vowing to make explicit production

08:09.200 --> 08:13.800
cuts, producing a barrel in OPEC's three largest producers—Saudi Arabia, Iran, and

08:13.800 --> 08:19.820
Iraq—cost at most, in the case of Iraq, a paltry $10.57.

08:19.820 --> 08:25.480
In the US, the average price of production was over $20 while in the UK, $44.

08:25.480 --> 08:30.740
At base, oil prices are simply a natural function of supply and demand, but thanks to a tangled

08:30.740 --> 08:35.800
web of nation-states, cartels, technical and geological constraints, investor confidence,

08:35.800 --> 08:42.120
geopolitical rivalries, and political negotiations, the supply side is anything but natural.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.880
Furthering the convolution as to what actually influences what you pay at the pump, and why

08:45.880 --> 08:52.400
it skyrocketed in 2022, is the fact that cars don't run on crude oil, they run on gasoline.

08:52.400 --> 08:57.560
Turning oil into gas requires a whole list of additional steps, and each step, in turn,

08:57.560 --> 08:59.440
accrues additional costs.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.680
Let's say some thousands of barrels have navigated the pumping, pricing, and shipping

09:03.680 --> 09:07.880
process and have made their way from Kuwait to Valero's marine terminal here at the

09:07.880 --> 09:11.000
Port of Los Angeles's berth 164.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.940
From there, it's transported here, to Valero's Wilmington Refinery.

09:14.940 --> 09:18.560
After spending some time in storage, the oil is sent through distilling towers, where it's

09:18.560 --> 09:22.800
heated until boiling, then, depending on its boiling point, divided off.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.760
The crude which boiled off at the lowest temperature, after treatment, will become propane, while

09:26.760 --> 09:29.880
the oil with the highest boiling point will end up as asphalt.

09:30.280 --> 09:33.840
While the exact traits of the oil, and the exact configuration of the refinery leads

09:33.840 --> 09:39.200
to discrepancies from plant to plant, on average, each barrel of oil produces about 19 gallons

09:39.200 --> 09:41.940
or 72 liters of car-grade gasoline.

09:41.940 --> 09:45.820
In other words, about 45% of the crude sent through Valero's Wilmington Towers will

09:45.820 --> 09:47.480
become gas.

09:47.480 --> 09:52.980
Refining oil into gas isn't cheap—in fact, 18% of gas' price emanates from this step

09:52.980 --> 09:54.340
alone.

09:54.340 --> 09:57.640
After Valero's distilling towers separate the gasoline, it is then treated and blended

09:57.640 --> 10:01.280
with additional ingredients like butane and ethanol, depending on the season and state

10:01.280 --> 10:06.660
environmental regulations, before being transported by rail, pipeline, and trucks to gas stations.

10:06.660 --> 10:10.200
Considering Southern California's rampant demand, there's a good chance that the gasoline

10:10.200 --> 10:14.400
process just up from the Port of Los Angeles goes on to get consumed within a 100 mile

10:14.400 --> 10:15.400
radius.

10:15.400 --> 10:20.320
Nationally, this step, distribution and marketing, accounts for another 12% of gas' price at

10:20.320 --> 10:24.500
the pump, and as any Californian will tell you, nearby refinement doesn't come with

10:24.500 --> 10:26.440
any sort of local discount.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.920
In fact, the state of California is home to the most expensive gas in the US.

10:30.920 --> 10:35.160
While favorable geography explains its critical ports, it's also geography that explains

10:35.160 --> 10:40.960
why its tankers, and practically only tankers, are supplying the state in the first place.

10:40.960 --> 10:45.040
Separated for many American suppliers by the towering Rockies and Sierras, California is

10:45.040 --> 10:47.640
effectively an energy island.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.520
With rail shipping from areas as far away as the Bakken prohibitively expensive, and

10:51.520 --> 10:56.900
pipeline projects both impractical and highly unpopular, California is nearly entirely reliant

10:56.900 --> 10:58.840
on importing oil by ship.

10:58.840 --> 11:02.320
But California's isolation isn't strictly geographical.

11:02.320 --> 11:07.240
The state's gas is more expensive than even Hawaii's because the gas itself is physically

11:07.240 --> 11:11.040
different, as California's uniquely strict environmental laws require additives like

11:11.040 --> 11:15.560
methyl turt butyl ether or ethanol mixed in to ensure a cleaner burn.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.980
Additionally, state fees for greenhouse gas initiatives and a higher state tax push California

11:19.980 --> 11:22.740
gas prices higher than national averages.

11:22.740 --> 11:27.040
And whether in California or not, taxes on gasoline contributed another major influence

11:27.040 --> 11:32.060
on price, making up, on national average, 11% of consumer gas prices.

11:32.060 --> 11:36.660
But as eye-popping as the state's prices may be, they represent a proportional climb

11:36.660 --> 11:39.900
relative to the eye-popping California prices of yesteryear.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.520
That's because while there are situational factors from state to state or country to

11:43.520 --> 11:47.980
country that influence prices, those are often used as strawmen to point fingers at state

11:47.980 --> 11:49.720
or national politicians.

11:49.720 --> 11:53.860
These factors hardly change in the short-term, so it truly informs the swings, what makes

11:53.860 --> 11:59.200
up 59% of the price of the pump is the price of the underlying commodity—the price of

11:59.200 --> 12:01.200
oil itself.

12:01.200 --> 12:05.360
This is a graph of 24 years of the world's total liquid fuels production, while this

12:05.360 --> 12:09.260
represents 24 years of the world's total liquid fuels consumption.

12:09.260 --> 12:13.560
By and large, the two lines match up quite closely—the world makes about as much fuel

12:13.560 --> 12:19.660
as it consumes at any given moment—however, it's the minor mismatches that matter here.

12:19.660 --> 12:24.100
Back in 07', a number of supply shocks occurred all at once—Venezuela cut off

12:24.100 --> 12:28.600
sales to ExxonMobil, Scottish oil workers went on strike, Iraqi pipelines were destroyed

12:28.600 --> 12:33.620
by saboteurs, Nigerian production was hampered by strikes and militant attacks—slowly and

12:33.620 --> 12:37.900
unintentionally, the supply line slipped beneath the demand line.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.260
Prices skyrocketed.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.380
While only some of the spike can be attributed directly to supply, and not to ensuing speculation

12:44.380 --> 12:48.820
and other market-based factors, the period demonstrated the sheer power of the law of

12:48.820 --> 12:51.200
supply and demand in oil and gas.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.220
Due to the inflexibility of consumption, with most unable to dramatically change their use

12:55.220 --> 13:01.280
of fossil fuels in the short-term, small changes in supply lead to huge changes in price.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.940
For cartels such as OPEC, with its unique ability to turn off the taps, this was hugely

13:05.940 --> 13:07.300
valuable knowledge.

13:07.300 --> 13:12.240
2008's rally was soon reversed by 2008's financial crisis, but prices steadily crept

13:12.240 --> 13:16.860
up to a comfortably high level for oil companies as the world economy heated up in the early

13:16.860 --> 13:18.160
2010s.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.340
In North America, however, innovators were brewing up one of the most dramatic revolutions

13:22.340 --> 13:25.540
in the oil industry's history.

13:25.540 --> 13:27.400
Shale is a dense rock.

13:27.400 --> 13:31.400
Unlike the sand or limestone that typically hosts the oil that ends up at the pump, this

13:31.400 --> 13:35.480
rock just isn't permeable enough for its hydrocarbons to flow out freely.

13:35.480 --> 13:39.600
This fact long informed the mindset of oil and gas executives, who considered the countless

13:39.600 --> 13:44.240
unexploited reservoirs of oil embedded within shale inaccessible—at least while turning

13:44.240 --> 13:45.240
a profit.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.640
But then came fracking.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.160
By injecting a fluid at high pressures and boreholes dug deep through the ground, one

13:50.160 --> 13:54.040
could create fissures in the rock out of which oil and natural gas flow freely.

13:54.040 --> 13:57.840
Ignoring the countless externalities, this brought the cost of producing shale oil to

13:57.840 --> 14:02.400
a competitive level, and thus began the Shale Revolution.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.840
Two of the world's most significant shale deposits sit in the US—West Texas's Permian

14:06.840 --> 14:10.280
Basin and Montana and North Dakota's Bakken Formation.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.980
Conveniently, unlike with much of the rest of the world, oil and gas deposits beneath

14:13.980 --> 14:18.020
the ground in the US are generally the property of the owner of said land, making the process

14:18.020 --> 14:22.380
of requiring rights to drill far less centralized and state-controlled than with the rest of

14:22.380 --> 14:23.380
the world.

14:23.380 --> 14:28.580
Therefore, in the early 2010s, as fracking propagated, each of these areas experienced

14:28.580 --> 14:30.980
a boom of gold rush proportions.

14:30.980 --> 14:36.380
What was the quiet, 14,000-person agricultural community of Williston, North Dakota, doubled

14:36.380 --> 14:39.540
in population across just four years.

14:39.540 --> 14:43.300
Oil workers flew in from around the country to claim six-figure starting salaries, but

14:43.340 --> 14:47.700
they had to deal with rent prices higher than those in Manhattan or San Francisco—$2,000

14:47.700 --> 14:51.460
a month for a one-bedroom and far more for a nice one.

14:51.460 --> 14:56.740
Everyone, from waiters to bartenders to cashiers to land-owning farmers, was making incredible

14:56.740 --> 15:00.500
amounts of money as the industry refused to stop growing.

15:00.500 --> 15:05.140
While the break-even price for shale oil was far higher than that of more traditional production

15:05.140 --> 15:09.780
methods, the upfront investment was relatively low—it was far cheaper to construct a fracking

15:09.780 --> 15:14.140
rig than an offshore oil rig, for example, so the boom was shepherded in not by Shell

15:14.140 --> 15:17.980
or Chevron, but by small, independent operators.

15:17.980 --> 15:21.980
These independent operators were too small to individually influence oil prices, but

15:21.980 --> 15:25.260
in net, they flooded the market with supply.

15:25.260 --> 15:29.620
Indicative of a boom time, operators were operating regardless of profitability—they

15:29.620 --> 15:33.680
were willing to lose in the short-term to secure market share in the long-term because

15:33.680 --> 15:35.740
they believed in the long-term potential.

15:35.740 --> 15:39.020
But that long-term hardly shaped up as expected.

15:39.020 --> 15:45.220
This supply glut was the major factor behind 2015's crash, and prices hardly recovered.

15:45.220 --> 15:49.860
OPEC and Western supermajors had simply lost control of the market.

15:49.860 --> 15:55.820
Oil was abundant, and, no matter how much they cut production, buyers found supply elsewhere.

15:55.820 --> 15:59.940
Observers everywhere started to question whether this was the end of OPEC.

15:59.940 --> 16:03.740
The cartel is only as good as the faith of its members in its effectiveness, and across

16:03.740 --> 16:07.420
much of the 2010s, it was hardly looking effective.

16:07.420 --> 16:10.020
But then came the before and after moment.

16:10.020 --> 16:12.960
Then came negative oil prices.

16:12.960 --> 16:18.520
Out of the most dramatic crash the industry had ever seen emerged an opportunity.

16:18.520 --> 16:23.660
Operators everywhere cut back, including the independent American shale companies.

16:23.660 --> 16:28.080
After slashing production faster and more deeply than ever before, OPEC brought back

16:28.080 --> 16:34.260
supply slowly—crucially slower than demand—and therefore the industry entered the longest

16:34.260 --> 16:38.620
sustained period of supply and demand mismatch since 2008.

16:38.620 --> 16:43.720
Indigitivly, prices climbed at a far faster pace than demand's recovery, and OPEC once

16:43.720 --> 16:48.460
again held control of the market—they once again became the entity that the world pointed

16:48.460 --> 16:51.500
to as the culprit behind the prices at the pump.

16:51.500 --> 16:55.960
But while broadly accurate, that would be an oversimplification.

16:55.960 --> 17:00.420
Western producers, too, have been tepid in building production back up, and it shows

17:00.420 --> 17:01.420
in the numbers.

17:01.420 --> 17:06.260
US shale oil producers' reinvestment rate—as in, the share of cash flow going back into

17:06.260 --> 17:10.220
the business rather than out to investors—is at an all-time low.

17:10.220 --> 17:14.340
Whereas last time oil prices sat at a comparable level, the reinvestment rate was quite literally

17:14.340 --> 17:19.580
off the charts, today, less than half of their money is being put back into the business.

17:19.580 --> 17:23.780
This investment is typically what would go into developing new rigs, but today, it's

17:23.780 --> 17:25.980
just getting paid out as profit.

17:25.980 --> 17:30.780
Companies have the ability to produce more—the US Bureau of Land Management has exactly 9,000

17:30.780 --> 17:35.540
approved but unused drilling permits on record—but companies just don't have the appetite to

17:35.540 --> 17:36.540
drill.

17:36.540 --> 17:41.200
Industry-wide, it's the same situation—Exxon Mobile, Shell, Chevron, and BP's capital

17:41.200 --> 17:45.100
expenditures are each at or near all-time lows.

17:45.100 --> 17:49.920
Simply put, oil companies are not investing in the future anymore—they're investing

17:49.920 --> 17:51.540
in now.

17:51.540 --> 17:53.780
This is not a misinformed strategy.

17:53.780 --> 17:59.940
Out of the S&P 500 Index's 11 distinct sectors, the energy sector—made up almost exclusively

17:59.940 --> 18:05.100
of oil and gas companies—has been by far the lowest performer since 2007.

18:05.100 --> 18:10.780
The sector only gained 41.7% in value across that era, which means it was actually flat

18:10.780 --> 18:11.980
with inflation.

18:11.980 --> 18:16.380
The oil and gas industry simply is not a good investment anymore, and so it's no surprise

18:16.380 --> 18:19.020
that it's not getting investment from outside or in.

18:19.020 --> 18:22.980
While it's up to debate whether we've reached peak oil, it'd be much easier to

18:22.980 --> 18:26.480
argue that we've reached peak oil investment.

18:26.480 --> 18:31.400
Because of the temporary, finite nature of any oil supply, a relatively high level of

18:31.400 --> 18:34.880
investment is needed just to keep production capacity stable.

18:34.880 --> 18:39.760
When the world looked like this, when climbing oil demand was all we knew, the logic behind

18:39.760 --> 18:44.360
investing $5.5 billion in a single pipeline was sound.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.640
Now, with the world looking like this, with the future of demand looking less confident

18:48.640 --> 18:54.400
than ever, even investing a couple tens of millions in a single fracking rig is risky.

18:54.400 --> 19:01.080
Oil going negative appeared to spur a fundamental mindset change among oil executives and investors.

19:01.080 --> 19:05.120
After having spent the past decades watching both the power of scarcity and the ruin of

19:05.120 --> 19:08.720
abundance, supplies become the enemy.

19:08.720 --> 19:13.680
Oil's under more pressure than ever to deliver profits now, because confidence in the future

19:13.680 --> 19:15.000
has been lost.

19:15.000 --> 19:22.120
ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, and BP each successfully posted record profits in 2021, and this can

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
continue.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.720
The end of oil is near.

19:25.720 --> 19:31.460
The momentum is already too strong—renewables are taking over—but the orchestra can keep

19:31.460 --> 19:33.700
playing as the ship goes down.

19:33.700 --> 19:38.440
In an era where there is no future industry growth to capture, scarcity is the name of

19:38.440 --> 19:39.440
the game.

19:39.440 --> 19:44.280
If oil companies keep supply tight, they'll keep prices high and capture consistent profits

19:44.280 --> 19:47.320
even as they add to the incentives of renewables.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.920
This appears to be the dominant strategy.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.560
The alternative would be to keep prices low to slow down the switch, but considering the

19:53.560 --> 19:57.640
driving force behind the transition is the prevention of the destruction of the planet,

19:57.640 --> 20:01.940
rather than the search for a more cost-effective source of energy, the profit-focused approach

20:01.940 --> 20:04.120
appears the most intuitive.

20:04.120 --> 20:09.160
Astonishingly, this means that the oil industry is seeding the market—they've lost, they're

20:09.160 --> 20:13.240
shepherding in renewables, but they're not going down without a fight.

20:13.240 --> 20:17.680
Moving to a carbonless world will take time, and the oil industry can shrink faster than

20:17.680 --> 20:19.280
renewables can grow.

20:19.280 --> 20:24.120
Therefore, short of a fundamental strategy shift by one of the world's largest industries,

20:24.120 --> 20:27.660
the era of high fuel prices is here to stay.

20:27.660 --> 20:32.400
For those unable or unwilling to transition early, the wait will cost them.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.380
For those who held onto ownership in the sector, they're starting to experience one last

20:36.380 --> 20:42.840
great rally—because the oil industry's party at the end of the world just started.

20:42.840 --> 20:47.720
As you may or may not have noticed, this video is really, secretly, a persuasive essay.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.400
In fact, pretty much every video of mine is a persuasive essay.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.180
No matter if I'm arguing that cyberwarfare is already a major threat, or that Russian

20:54.180 --> 20:58.600
military logistics failed in Ukraine, or that the fine art market is a scam, I'm almost

20:58.600 --> 21:02.520
always arguing something, and I'd also argue that a big reason behind the success of this

21:02.520 --> 21:05.280
channel is my ability to do that effectively.

21:05.280 --> 21:08.800
There are a lot of techniques that are objectively useful in trying to persuade someone of a

21:08.800 --> 21:11.960
point, so I've gathered everything I've learned both by studying persuasive theory

21:11.960 --> 21:15.840
in college and doing this for the past six years, and made a class about the theories

21:15.840 --> 21:17.720
and techniques of persuasion.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.440
And not only did I make a class, I made an online classes platform.

21:21.440 --> 21:25.440
Myself, my co-founders, and the incredible management, production, and engineering teams

21:25.440 --> 21:29.400
behind Nebula have been working for much of the past year to bring you the platform's

21:29.400 --> 21:32.980
biggest expansion to date—Nebula Classes.

21:32.980 --> 21:36.620
We know that many of you want to learn more, and in more detail, from the educational creators

21:36.620 --> 21:39.840
you already watch, so this is the platform for that.

21:39.840 --> 21:44.200
In addition to mine, there are already other courses by Volksgeist, Amy Nolte, LowSpecGamer,

21:44.200 --> 21:49.520
Georgia Dow, Thomas Frank, and others, and there will be new ones every single week.

21:49.520 --> 21:53.440
Each is fantastically produced, with creators having flown out to a dedicated studio to

21:53.440 --> 21:55.720
assure consistent quality.

21:55.720 --> 21:59.840
Classes is available for just $10 a month or $100 a year, and that includes the over

21:59.840 --> 22:04.400
10,000 videos and originals created by the curated list of 150 Nebula creators already.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.440
However, for the tens of thousands of Wendover viewers that have already signed up for Nebula,

22:08.440 --> 22:13.160
including through CuriosityStream, it's just $5 a month or $50 a year to upgrade.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.040
Click the button on screen or head to the link in the description to sign up, and you'll

22:16.040 --> 22:20.160
be supporting Wendover and loads of other independent creators while you're at it.
