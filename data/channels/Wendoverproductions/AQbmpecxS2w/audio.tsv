0	5980	Remember this, remember that moment in April of 2020 when the oil market made headlines,
5980	10480	when the value of West Texas intermediate futures plummeted 300%, when the cost of a
10480	17640	barrel hit $0, then went below zero, then closed the day at negative $37.62?
17640	21880	Maybe you don't—it was a never-before-seen moment nestled between countless never-before-seen
21880	27240	moments—but this moment created this one—oil futures trading at the highest levels in a
27240	30760	decade, gas prices at an all-time high.
30760	36240	The worst day in the oil market's history is responsible for ushering in a new era of
36240	38680	record industry profits.
38680	43080	In the wake of a singular crash, and looking down the barrel of the industry's most existential
43080	49160	threat to date, oil and gas has found a new way to extract more money than ever from the
49160	50160	earth.
50160	55940	The era of scarcity is here, and oil's old ways are over.
55940	60700	Three decades ago, Azerbaijan found itself in front of opportunity.
60700	65380	With the end of August 1991 came the start of the independent Republic of Azerbaijan
65380	70560	as the Soviet Union shed yet another one of its states, and the Iron Curtain rose to reveal
70560	73540	a massive reservoir of oil.
73540	77600	Laying beneath the Caspian was one of the biggest opportunities ever presented to the
77600	79560	Western oil and gas industry.
79560	84360	For decades up until that point, the USSR had been the world's largest oil producer,
84360	89200	but of increasing ire to the private Western producers was OPEC—a cartel of major Middle
89200	93080	Eastern, African, and South American oil-producing countries.
93080	97800	Collectively, market power swayed increasingly away from Washington, but the Caspian had
97800	101740	the potential to put power of the world's most valuable commodity back into what was
101740	104120	considered more trusted hands.
104120	108480	But simultaneously, if managed poorly, it had the same potential to cement the power
108480	111400	of OPEC or the new Russian state.
111440	116760	So, the starter pistol had sounded, and the scramble of the century began.
116760	121200	Azerbaijan has a history as an oil economy—in fact, in the earliest days of the industry,
121200	125000	the country's exports accounted for more than half of the world's supply, but a lack
125000	129400	of focus and investment by their Soviet rulers had transformed the former power player into
129400	132200	a dilapidated, insignificant producer.
132200	135960	To change that, the nation would need investment—and a lot of it.
135960	140560	Baku Street soon hosted a rotating cast of oil executives and diplomats, all there to
140560	144760	court the government into signing a contract with them, rather than their competitor.
144760	149720	A conclusion came in 1994, when ten companies gathered together to sign what was described
149720	154400	as the contract of the century—they would jointly invest, develop, and operate one of
154400	157900	the most valuable oil fields the world had ever produced.
157900	162360	The supply was set, so now all they needed was a way to sell it.
162360	166400	Despite its name and stature, the Caspian Sea is not truly a sea.
166760	171120	It's an endorheic basin, meaning water flows in, but only evaporates out.
171120	176200	Therefore, crucially, unlike its neighbor the Black Sea, the Caspian has no connection
176200	177440	to the ocean.
177440	181680	Simply loading crude into a tanker and sending it to market was impossible—the consortium
181680	183800	needed another route to market.
183800	188200	For the longest time, Azerbaijan exported oil by loading into rail cars routed west
188200	192500	to the Black Sea, where it would be transferred to tanker ships, but both rail and tanker
192500	195160	took substantial cuts out of the profit.
195160	198320	While rails provide an excellent stopgap during pipeline construction or production
198320	203000	booms, travel along already established infrastructure, and can flexibly ship oil to where the market's
203000	205860	the hottest, they don't come cheap.
205860	210200	Using present-day rates from the US, rail transport adds between $5 and $10 a barrel
210200	214320	in cost, making it two to three times more expensive than by pipeline.
214320	217980	Trains were more accident-prone too, and considering that the outbound oil from the Caspian had
217980	222660	a predetermined origin and destination, the only benefit the consortium gained by transporting
222660	226200	oil from the Caspian to the Black Sea via rail was that it didn't have to front the
226200	228420	cost of building a pipeline.
228420	233420	Like the railways, shipping oil out of the Black Sea on tankers proved workable but inefficient.
233420	237300	While connected to the Mediterranean and the world beyond, navigating the 12th treacherously
237300	241700	tight and winding turns of the Bosporus Strait, linking the Black Sea to the wider world through
241700	245040	the very heart of Istanbul, was less than ideal.
245040	249580	The strait proved too narrow for the increasingly common very large crude carriers capable of
249580	253520	shipping 2 million barrels, while the ever-present risk of a single miscalculation closing the
253520	258860	strait for months and stopping Azerbaijani oil in its tracks loomed over the precarious
258860	259860	operation.
259860	264960	That left one good option—pipeline—the safest, most efficient method of shipping
264960	266460	crude oil.
266460	269820	With minimal operating costs and maintenance requirements, shipping a barrel by pipeline
269820	275000	in the US today only adds about $3 to $5 in cost, varying slightly based on quality of
275000	276660	product and distance traveled.
276740	280900	But while pipelines are incredibly cost-effective once in use, to the extent that the US and
280900	286560	Canada are crossed by 100,000 miles or 160,000 kilometers of them, getting such systems online
286560	289660	represents a major upfront investment.
289660	294300	In a 2016 study, economists estimated that building a modest regional pipeline, 12 inches
294300	299260	or 30 centimeters wide and approximately 200 miles or 320 kilometers in length across mostly
299260	307100	flat land would cost a staggering $1.5 million per mile or $960,000 per kilometer.
307100	311100	Connecting the Caspian Sea to the outside world via pipeline would be anything but a
311100	312520	modest endeavor.
312520	316200	The simplest project, for instance, would have been to reverse an existing pipeline
316200	321440	previously used to supply Azerbaijan to route oil northward into Russia's extensive network,
321440	323980	but the US vehemently opposed this.
323980	327820	That would give Russia even greater influence over Azerbaijan's economy.
327820	331360	Another option, routing through Iran, was briefly floated, but this was quickly shot
331360	333980	down due to geopolitical factors as well.
333980	338620	Therefore, that left the western option, which, too, was undesirable.
338620	343420	Georgia was a geopolitically unstable country composed almost exclusively of rough mountainous
343420	346900	terrain, so building a pipeline through it would be risky and expensive.
346900	352740	But it was also the only option left, so construction started on one of the costliest pipelines
352740	353740	in history.
353740	358380	Then, as it became clear that the Bosporus Strait wasn't viable long-term, they started
358380	360300	building another.
360300	365020	To provide a stable route to market, to get that crucial Mediterranean Sea access, the
365020	369020	consortium would have to build one of the longest oil pipelines in the world over some
369020	372380	of the harshest terrain ever spanned by a pipeline.
372380	377380	The 41-inch, 104-centimeter pipe would have to cross three countries, the towering peaks
377380	383660	of the Caucasus, 1,500 streams and rivers, and 3,000 roads, railways, and utility lines.
383660	393260	Therefore, it came with a stratospheric price tag—inflation-adjusted $5.5 billion—but
393260	396840	the consortium was willing to write this check as it was what was necessary to capture the
396840	400220	massive profit potential of Caspian oil.
400220	406120	But for every 1990s Caspian sea boom, there's a 2021 Permian Basin bust.
406120	410600	For reliant nation-states, this volatility is dangerous.
410600	414080	Volatility though, has been largely countered by cooperation.
414080	418760	Beginning at a Baghdad conference in 1960 attended by officials from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
418760	423680	Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, major Middle Eastern, African, and South American oil producers
423680	429120	have sought to limit overproduction and price fluctuation by controlling global supply.
429120	433600	Made up of these 13 countries today, OPEC sets oil production quotas to maintain the
433600	439120	organization's position of power and, to the extent they can, set a barrel's price.
439120	442960	The organization does this by relying on each member state's ability to ramp or cut crude
442960	447520	production and the organization's sheer scale—that its members produce 40% of the
447520	452040	world's supply and account for nearly 80% of the world's proven reserves.
452040	456240	While Western producers rely on private companies to navigate the massive booms and busts of
456240	461080	the free market with comparatively limited state influence, OPEC functions as an international
461080	466680	cartel whose structure and geological advantages have proved difficult to circumvent, undermine,
466680	467980	or unseat.
467980	473320	In this context, OPEC introduces a crucial component of oil economics—that the price
473320	478000	per barrel is not exactly dependent on the cost of producing that barrel.
478000	479640	Take 2016, for example.
479640	484180	In a year when West Texas intermediate crude prices plummeted below $40, a mark so low
484180	489200	that OPEC broke convention by welcoming Russia into OPEC+, and vowing to make explicit production
489200	493800	cuts, producing a barrel in OPEC's three largest producers—Saudi Arabia, Iran, and
493800	499820	Iraq—cost at most, in the case of Iraq, a paltry $10.57.
499820	505480	In the US, the average price of production was over $20 while in the UK, $44.
505480	510740	At base, oil prices are simply a natural function of supply and demand, but thanks to a tangled
510740	515800	web of nation-states, cartels, technical and geological constraints, investor confidence,
515800	522120	geopolitical rivalries, and political negotiations, the supply side is anything but natural.
522120	525880	Furthering the convolution as to what actually influences what you pay at the pump, and why
525880	532400	it skyrocketed in 2022, is the fact that cars don't run on crude oil, they run on gasoline.
532400	537560	Turning oil into gas requires a whole list of additional steps, and each step, in turn,
537560	539440	accrues additional costs.
539440	543680	Let's say some thousands of barrels have navigated the pumping, pricing, and shipping
543680	547880	process and have made their way from Kuwait to Valero's marine terminal here at the
547880	551000	Port of Los Angeles's berth 164.
551000	554940	From there, it's transported here, to Valero's Wilmington Refinery.
554940	558560	After spending some time in storage, the oil is sent through distilling towers, where it's
558560	562800	heated until boiling, then, depending on its boiling point, divided off.
562800	566760	The crude which boiled off at the lowest temperature, after treatment, will become propane, while
566760	569880	the oil with the highest boiling point will end up as asphalt.
570280	573840	While the exact traits of the oil, and the exact configuration of the refinery leads
573840	579200	to discrepancies from plant to plant, on average, each barrel of oil produces about 19 gallons
579200	581940	or 72 liters of car-grade gasoline.
581940	585820	In other words, about 45% of the crude sent through Valero's Wilmington Towers will
585820	587480	become gas.
587480	592980	Refining oil into gas isn't cheap—in fact, 18% of gas' price emanates from this step
592980	594340	alone.
594340	597640	After Valero's distilling towers separate the gasoline, it is then treated and blended
597640	601280	with additional ingredients like butane and ethanol, depending on the season and state
601280	606660	environmental regulations, before being transported by rail, pipeline, and trucks to gas stations.
606660	610200	Considering Southern California's rampant demand, there's a good chance that the gasoline
610200	614400	process just up from the Port of Los Angeles goes on to get consumed within a 100 mile
614400	615400	radius.
615400	620320	Nationally, this step, distribution and marketing, accounts for another 12% of gas' price at
620320	624500	the pump, and as any Californian will tell you, nearby refinement doesn't come with
624500	626440	any sort of local discount.
626440	630920	In fact, the state of California is home to the most expensive gas in the US.
630920	635160	While favorable geography explains its critical ports, it's also geography that explains
635160	640960	why its tankers, and practically only tankers, are supplying the state in the first place.
640960	645040	Separated for many American suppliers by the towering Rockies and Sierras, California is
645040	647640	effectively an energy island.
647640	651520	With rail shipping from areas as far away as the Bakken prohibitively expensive, and
651520	656900	pipeline projects both impractical and highly unpopular, California is nearly entirely reliant
656900	658840	on importing oil by ship.
658840	662320	But California's isolation isn't strictly geographical.
662320	667240	The state's gas is more expensive than even Hawaii's because the gas itself is physically
667240	671040	different, as California's uniquely strict environmental laws require additives like
671040	675560	methyl turt butyl ether or ethanol mixed in to ensure a cleaner burn.
675560	679980	Additionally, state fees for greenhouse gas initiatives and a higher state tax push California
679980	682740	gas prices higher than national averages.
682740	687040	And whether in California or not, taxes on gasoline contributed another major influence
687040	692060	on price, making up, on national average, 11% of consumer gas prices.
692060	696660	But as eye-popping as the state's prices may be, they represent a proportional climb
696660	699900	relative to the eye-popping California prices of yesteryear.
699900	703520	That's because while there are situational factors from state to state or country to
703520	707980	country that influence prices, those are often used as strawmen to point fingers at state
707980	709720	or national politicians.
709720	713860	These factors hardly change in the short-term, so it truly informs the swings, what makes
713860	719200	up 59% of the price of the pump is the price of the underlying commodity—the price of
719200	721200	oil itself.
721200	725360	This is a graph of 24 years of the world's total liquid fuels production, while this
725360	729260	represents 24 years of the world's total liquid fuels consumption.
729260	733560	By and large, the two lines match up quite closely—the world makes about as much fuel
733560	739660	as it consumes at any given moment—however, it's the minor mismatches that matter here.
739660	744100	Back in 07', a number of supply shocks occurred all at once—Venezuela cut off
744100	748600	sales to ExxonMobil, Scottish oil workers went on strike, Iraqi pipelines were destroyed
748600	753620	by saboteurs, Nigerian production was hampered by strikes and militant attacks—slowly and
753620	757900	unintentionally, the supply line slipped beneath the demand line.
757900	760260	Prices skyrocketed.
760260	764380	While only some of the spike can be attributed directly to supply, and not to ensuing speculation
764380	768820	and other market-based factors, the period demonstrated the sheer power of the law of
768820	771200	supply and demand in oil and gas.
771200	775220	Due to the inflexibility of consumption, with most unable to dramatically change their use
775220	781280	of fossil fuels in the short-term, small changes in supply lead to huge changes in price.
781280	785940	For cartels such as OPEC, with its unique ability to turn off the taps, this was hugely
785940	787300	valuable knowledge.
787300	792240	2008's rally was soon reversed by 2008's financial crisis, but prices steadily crept
792240	796860	up to a comfortably high level for oil companies as the world economy heated up in the early
796860	798160	2010s.
798160	802340	In North America, however, innovators were brewing up one of the most dramatic revolutions
802340	805540	in the oil industry's history.
805540	807400	Shale is a dense rock.
807400	811400	Unlike the sand or limestone that typically hosts the oil that ends up at the pump, this
811400	815480	rock just isn't permeable enough for its hydrocarbons to flow out freely.
815480	819600	This fact long informed the mindset of oil and gas executives, who considered the countless
819600	824240	unexploited reservoirs of oil embedded within shale inaccessible—at least while turning
824240	825240	a profit.
825240	826640	But then came fracking.
826640	830160	By injecting a fluid at high pressures and boreholes dug deep through the ground, one
830160	834040	could create fissures in the rock out of which oil and natural gas flow freely.
834040	837840	Ignoring the countless externalities, this brought the cost of producing shale oil to
837840	842400	a competitive level, and thus began the Shale Revolution.
842400	846840	Two of the world's most significant shale deposits sit in the US—West Texas's Permian
846840	850280	Basin and Montana and North Dakota's Bakken Formation.
850280	853980	Conveniently, unlike with much of the rest of the world, oil and gas deposits beneath
853980	858020	the ground in the US are generally the property of the owner of said land, making the process
858020	862380	of requiring rights to drill far less centralized and state-controlled than with the rest of
862380	863380	the world.
863380	868580	Therefore, in the early 2010s, as fracking propagated, each of these areas experienced
868580	870980	a boom of gold rush proportions.
870980	876380	What was the quiet, 14,000-person agricultural community of Williston, North Dakota, doubled
876380	879540	in population across just four years.
879540	883300	Oil workers flew in from around the country to claim six-figure starting salaries, but
883340	887700	they had to deal with rent prices higher than those in Manhattan or San Francisco—$2,000
887700	891460	a month for a one-bedroom and far more for a nice one.
891460	896740	Everyone, from waiters to bartenders to cashiers to land-owning farmers, was making incredible
896740	900500	amounts of money as the industry refused to stop growing.
900500	905140	While the break-even price for shale oil was far higher than that of more traditional production
905140	909780	methods, the upfront investment was relatively low—it was far cheaper to construct a fracking
909780	914140	rig than an offshore oil rig, for example, so the boom was shepherded in not by Shell
914140	917980	or Chevron, but by small, independent operators.
917980	921980	These independent operators were too small to individually influence oil prices, but
921980	925260	in net, they flooded the market with supply.
925260	929620	Indicative of a boom time, operators were operating regardless of profitability—they
929620	933680	were willing to lose in the short-term to secure market share in the long-term because
933680	935740	they believed in the long-term potential.
935740	939020	But that long-term hardly shaped up as expected.
939020	945220	This supply glut was the major factor behind 2015's crash, and prices hardly recovered.
945220	949860	OPEC and Western supermajors had simply lost control of the market.
949860	955820	Oil was abundant, and, no matter how much they cut production, buyers found supply elsewhere.
955820	959940	Observers everywhere started to question whether this was the end of OPEC.
959940	963740	The cartel is only as good as the faith of its members in its effectiveness, and across
963740	967420	much of the 2010s, it was hardly looking effective.
967420	970020	But then came the before and after moment.
970020	972960	Then came negative oil prices.
972960	978520	Out of the most dramatic crash the industry had ever seen emerged an opportunity.
978520	983660	Operators everywhere cut back, including the independent American shale companies.
983660	988080	After slashing production faster and more deeply than ever before, OPEC brought back
988080	994260	supply slowly—crucially slower than demand—and therefore the industry entered the longest
994260	998620	sustained period of supply and demand mismatch since 2008.
998620	1003720	Indigitivly, prices climbed at a far faster pace than demand's recovery, and OPEC once
1003720	1008460	again held control of the market—they once again became the entity that the world pointed
1008460	1011500	to as the culprit behind the prices at the pump.
1011500	1015960	But while broadly accurate, that would be an oversimplification.
1015960	1020420	Western producers, too, have been tepid in building production back up, and it shows
1020420	1021420	in the numbers.
1021420	1026260	US shale oil producers' reinvestment rate—as in, the share of cash flow going back into
1026260	1030220	the business rather than out to investors—is at an all-time low.
1030220	1034340	Whereas last time oil prices sat at a comparable level, the reinvestment rate was quite literally
1034340	1039580	off the charts, today, less than half of their money is being put back into the business.
1039580	1043780	This investment is typically what would go into developing new rigs, but today, it's
1043780	1045980	just getting paid out as profit.
1045980	1050780	Companies have the ability to produce more—the US Bureau of Land Management has exactly 9,000
1050780	1055540	approved but unused drilling permits on record—but companies just don't have the appetite to
1055540	1056540	drill.
1056540	1061200	Industry-wide, it's the same situation—Exxon Mobile, Shell, Chevron, and BP's capital
1061200	1065100	expenditures are each at or near all-time lows.
1065100	1069920	Simply put, oil companies are not investing in the future anymore—they're investing
1069920	1071540	in now.
1071540	1073780	This is not a misinformed strategy.
1073780	1079940	Out of the S&P 500 Index's 11 distinct sectors, the energy sector—made up almost exclusively
1079940	1085100	of oil and gas companies—has been by far the lowest performer since 2007.
1085100	1090780	The sector only gained 41.7% in value across that era, which means it was actually flat
1090780	1091980	with inflation.
1091980	1096380	The oil and gas industry simply is not a good investment anymore, and so it's no surprise
1096380	1099020	that it's not getting investment from outside or in.
1099020	1102980	While it's up to debate whether we've reached peak oil, it'd be much easier to
1102980	1106480	argue that we've reached peak oil investment.
1106480	1111400	Because of the temporary, finite nature of any oil supply, a relatively high level of
1111400	1114880	investment is needed just to keep production capacity stable.
1114880	1119760	When the world looked like this, when climbing oil demand was all we knew, the logic behind
1119760	1124360	investing $5.5 billion in a single pipeline was sound.
1124360	1128640	Now, with the world looking like this, with the future of demand looking less confident
1128640	1134400	than ever, even investing a couple tens of millions in a single fracking rig is risky.
1134400	1141080	Oil going negative appeared to spur a fundamental mindset change among oil executives and investors.
1141080	1145120	After having spent the past decades watching both the power of scarcity and the ruin of
1145120	1148720	abundance, supplies become the enemy.
1148720	1153680	Oil's under more pressure than ever to deliver profits now, because confidence in the future
1153680	1155000	has been lost.
1155000	1162120	ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, and BP each successfully posted record profits in 2021, and this can
1162120	1163120	continue.
1163120	1165720	The end of oil is near.
1165720	1171460	The momentum is already too strong—renewables are taking over—but the orchestra can keep
1171460	1173700	playing as the ship goes down.
1173700	1178440	In an era where there is no future industry growth to capture, scarcity is the name of
1178440	1179440	the game.
1179440	1184280	If oil companies keep supply tight, they'll keep prices high and capture consistent profits
1184280	1187320	even as they add to the incentives of renewables.
1187320	1189920	This appears to be the dominant strategy.
1189920	1193560	The alternative would be to keep prices low to slow down the switch, but considering the
1193560	1197640	driving force behind the transition is the prevention of the destruction of the planet,
1197640	1201940	rather than the search for a more cost-effective source of energy, the profit-focused approach
1201940	1204120	appears the most intuitive.
1204120	1209160	Astonishingly, this means that the oil industry is seeding the market—they've lost, they're
1209160	1213240	shepherding in renewables, but they're not going down without a fight.
1213240	1217680	Moving to a carbonless world will take time, and the oil industry can shrink faster than
1217680	1219280	renewables can grow.
1219280	1224120	Therefore, short of a fundamental strategy shift by one of the world's largest industries,
1224120	1227660	the era of high fuel prices is here to stay.
1227660	1232400	For those unable or unwilling to transition early, the wait will cost them.
1232400	1236380	For those who held onto ownership in the sector, they're starting to experience one last
1236380	1242840	great rally—because the oil industry's party at the end of the world just started.
1242840	1247720	As you may or may not have noticed, this video is really, secretly, a persuasive essay.
1247720	1250400	In fact, pretty much every video of mine is a persuasive essay.
1250400	1254180	No matter if I'm arguing that cyberwarfare is already a major threat, or that Russian
1254180	1258600	military logistics failed in Ukraine, or that the fine art market is a scam, I'm almost
1258600	1262520	always arguing something, and I'd also argue that a big reason behind the success of this
1262520	1265280	channel is my ability to do that effectively.
1265280	1268800	There are a lot of techniques that are objectively useful in trying to persuade someone of a
1268800	1271960	point, so I've gathered everything I've learned both by studying persuasive theory
1271960	1275840	in college and doing this for the past six years, and made a class about the theories
1275840	1277720	and techniques of persuasion.
1277720	1281440	And not only did I make a class, I made an online classes platform.
1281440	1285440	Myself, my co-founders, and the incredible management, production, and engineering teams
1285440	1289400	behind Nebula have been working for much of the past year to bring you the platform's
1289400	1292980	biggest expansion to date—Nebula Classes.
1292980	1296620	We know that many of you want to learn more, and in more detail, from the educational creators
1296620	1299840	you already watch, so this is the platform for that.
1299840	1304200	In addition to mine, there are already other courses by Volksgeist, Amy Nolte, LowSpecGamer,
1304200	1309520	Georgia Dow, Thomas Frank, and others, and there will be new ones every single week.
1309520	1313440	Each is fantastically produced, with creators having flown out to a dedicated studio to
1313440	1315720	assure consistent quality.
1315720	1319840	Classes is available for just $10 a month or $100 a year, and that includes the over
1319840	1324400	10,000 videos and originals created by the curated list of 150 Nebula creators already.
1324400	1328440	However, for the tens of thousands of Wendover viewers that have already signed up for Nebula,
1328440	1333160	including through CuriosityStream, it's just $5 a month or $50 a year to upgrade.
1333160	1336040	Click the button on screen or head to the link in the description to sign up, and you'll
1336040	1340160	be supporting Wendover and loads of other independent creators while you're at it.
