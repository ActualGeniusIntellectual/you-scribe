1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
Remember this, remember that moment in April of 2020 when the oil market made headlines,

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:10,480
when the value of West Texas intermediate futures plummeted 300%, when the cost of a

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:17,640
barrel hit $0, then went below zero, then closed the day at negative $37.62?

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,880
Maybe you don't—it was a never-before-seen moment nestled between countless never-before-seen

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,240
moments—but this moment created this one—oil futures trading at the highest levels in a

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,760
decade, gas prices at an all-time high.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,240
The worst day in the oil market's history is responsible for ushering in a new era of

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,680
record industry profits.

9
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,080
In the wake of a singular crash, and looking down the barrel of the industry's most existential

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:49,160
threat to date, oil and gas has found a new way to extract more money than ever from the

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,160
earth.

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,940
The era of scarcity is here, and oil's old ways are over.

13
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,700
Three decades ago, Azerbaijan found itself in front of opportunity.

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,380
With the end of August 1991 came the start of the independent Republic of Azerbaijan

15
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:10,560
as the Soviet Union shed yet another one of its states, and the Iron Curtain rose to reveal

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,540
a massive reservoir of oil.

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,600
Laying beneath the Caspian was one of the biggest opportunities ever presented to the

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,560
Western oil and gas industry.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,360
For decades up until that point, the USSR had been the world's largest oil producer,

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,200
but of increasing ire to the private Western producers was OPEC—a cartel of major Middle

21
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,080
Eastern, African, and South American oil-producing countries.

22
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,800
Collectively, market power swayed increasingly away from Washington, but the Caspian had

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,740
the potential to put power of the world's most valuable commodity back into what was

24
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,120
considered more trusted hands.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,480
But simultaneously, if managed poorly, it had the same potential to cement the power

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,400
of OPEC or the new Russian state.

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,760
So, the starter pistol had sounded, and the scramble of the century began.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:01,200
Azerbaijan has a history as an oil economy—in fact, in the earliest days of the industry,

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,000
the country's exports accounted for more than half of the world's supply, but a lack

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,400
of focus and investment by their Soviet rulers had transformed the former power player into

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,200
a dilapidated, insignificant producer.

32
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,960
To change that, the nation would need investment—and a lot of it.

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,560
Baku Street soon hosted a rotating cast of oil executives and diplomats, all there to

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,760
court the government into signing a contract with them, rather than their competitor.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,720
A conclusion came in 1994, when ten companies gathered together to sign what was described

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,400
as the contract of the century—they would jointly invest, develop, and operate one of

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,900
the most valuable oil fields the world had ever produced.

38
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:42,360
The supply was set, so now all they needed was a way to sell it.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,400
Despite its name and stature, the Caspian Sea is not truly a sea.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,120
It's an endorheic basin, meaning water flows in, but only evaporates out.

41
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,200
Therefore, crucially, unlike its neighbor the Black Sea, the Caspian has no connection

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,440
to the ocean.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Simply loading crude into a tanker and sending it to market was impossible—the consortium

44
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,800
needed another route to market.

45
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,200
For the longest time, Azerbaijan exported oil by loading into rail cars routed west

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,500
to the Black Sea, where it would be transferred to tanker ships, but both rail and tanker

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,160
took substantial cuts out of the profit.

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,320
While rails provide an excellent stopgap during pipeline construction or production

49
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,000
booms, travel along already established infrastructure, and can flexibly ship oil to where the market's

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,860
the hottest, they don't come cheap.

51
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,200
Using present-day rates from the US, rail transport adds between $5 and $10 a barrel

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,320
in cost, making it two to three times more expensive than by pipeline.

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,980
Trains were more accident-prone too, and considering that the outbound oil from the Caspian had

54
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,660
a predetermined origin and destination, the only benefit the consortium gained by transporting

55
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,200
oil from the Caspian to the Black Sea via rail was that it didn't have to front the

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,420
cost of building a pipeline.

57
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,420
Like the railways, shipping oil out of the Black Sea on tankers proved workable but inefficient.

58
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,300
While connected to the Mediterranean and the world beyond, navigating the 12th treacherously

59
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,700
tight and winding turns of the Bosporus Strait, linking the Black Sea to the wider world through

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,040
the very heart of Istanbul, was less than ideal.

61
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,580
The strait proved too narrow for the increasingly common very large crude carriers capable of

62
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,520
shipping 2 million barrels, while the ever-present risk of a single miscalculation closing the

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,860
strait for months and stopping Azerbaijani oil in its tracks loomed over the precarious

64
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
operation.

65
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,960
That left one good option—pipeline—the safest, most efficient method of shipping

66
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,460
crude oil.

67
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,820
With minimal operating costs and maintenance requirements, shipping a barrel by pipeline

68
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,000
in the US today only adds about $3 to $5 in cost, varying slightly based on quality of

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,660
product and distance traveled.

70
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,900
But while pipelines are incredibly cost-effective once in use, to the extent that the US and

71
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,560
Canada are crossed by 100,000 miles or 160,000 kilometers of them, getting such systems online

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,660
represents a major upfront investment.

73
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,300
In a 2016 study, economists estimated that building a modest regional pipeline, 12 inches

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,260
or 30 centimeters wide and approximately 200 miles or 320 kilometers in length across mostly

75
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:07,100
flat land would cost a staggering $1.5 million per mile or $960,000 per kilometer.

76
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Connecting the Caspian Sea to the outside world via pipeline would be anything but a

77
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,520
modest endeavor.

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,200
The simplest project, for instance, would have been to reverse an existing pipeline

79
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:21,440
previously used to supply Azerbaijan to route oil northward into Russia's extensive network,

80
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,980
but the US vehemently opposed this.

81
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,820
That would give Russia even greater influence over Azerbaijan's economy.

82
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,360
Another option, routing through Iran, was briefly floated, but this was quickly shot

83
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,980
down due to geopolitical factors as well.

84
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,620
Therefore, that left the western option, which, too, was undesirable.

85
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,420
Georgia was a geopolitically unstable country composed almost exclusively of rough mountainous

86
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,900
terrain, so building a pipeline through it would be risky and expensive.

87
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,740
But it was also the only option left, so construction started on one of the costliest pipelines

88
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,740
in history.

89
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,380
Then, as it became clear that the Bosporus Strait wasn't viable long-term, they started

90
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,300
building another.

91
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,020
To provide a stable route to market, to get that crucial Mediterranean Sea access, the

92
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,020
consortium would have to build one of the longest oil pipelines in the world over some

93
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,380
of the harshest terrain ever spanned by a pipeline.

94
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,380
The 41-inch, 104-centimeter pipe would have to cross three countries, the towering peaks

95
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,660
of the Caucasus, 1,500 streams and rivers, and 3,000 roads, railways, and utility lines.

96
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:33,260
Therefore, it came with a stratospheric price tag—inflation-adjusted $5.5 billion—but

97
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,840
the consortium was willing to write this check as it was what was necessary to capture the

98
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,220
massive profit potential of Caspian oil.

99
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:46,120
But for every 1990s Caspian sea boom, there's a 2021 Permian Basin bust.

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,600
For reliant nation-states, this volatility is dangerous.

101
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,080
Volatility though, has been largely countered by cooperation.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,760
Beginning at a Baghdad conference in 1960 attended by officials from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,680
Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela, major Middle Eastern, African, and South American oil producers

104
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,120
have sought to limit overproduction and price fluctuation by controlling global supply.

105
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Made up of these 13 countries today, OPEC sets oil production quotas to maintain the

106
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,120
organization's position of power and, to the extent they can, set a barrel's price.

107
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
The organization does this by relying on each member state's ability to ramp or cut crude

108
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,520
production and the organization's sheer scale—that its members produce 40% of the

109
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,040
world's supply and account for nearly 80% of the world's proven reserves.

110
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,240
While Western producers rely on private companies to navigate the massive booms and busts of

111
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,080
the free market with comparatively limited state influence, OPEC functions as an international

112
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,680
cartel whose structure and geological advantages have proved difficult to circumvent, undermine,

113
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,980
or unseat.

114
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,320
In this context, OPEC introduces a crucial component of oil economics—that the price

115
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,000
per barrel is not exactly dependent on the cost of producing that barrel.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,640
Take 2016, for example.

117
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,180
In a year when West Texas intermediate crude prices plummeted below $40, a mark so low

118
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,200
that OPEC broke convention by welcoming Russia into OPEC+, and vowing to make explicit production

119
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,800
cuts, producing a barrel in OPEC's three largest producers—Saudi Arabia, Iran, and

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,820
Iraq—cost at most, in the case of Iraq, a paltry $10.57.

121
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,480
In the US, the average price of production was over $20 while in the UK, $44.

122
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,740
At base, oil prices are simply a natural function of supply and demand, but thanks to a tangled

123
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:35,800
web of nation-states, cartels, technical and geological constraints, investor confidence,

124
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,120
geopolitical rivalries, and political negotiations, the supply side is anything but natural.

125
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,880
Furthering the convolution as to what actually influences what you pay at the pump, and why

126
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,400
it skyrocketed in 2022, is the fact that cars don't run on crude oil, they run on gasoline.

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,560
Turning oil into gas requires a whole list of additional steps, and each step, in turn,

128
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
accrues additional costs.

129
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
Let's say some thousands of barrels have navigated the pumping, pricing, and shipping

130
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,880
process and have made their way from Kuwait to Valero's marine terminal here at the

131
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,000
Port of Los Angeles's berth 164.

132
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,940
From there, it's transported here, to Valero's Wilmington Refinery.

133
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,560
After spending some time in storage, the oil is sent through distilling towers, where it's

134
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,800
heated until boiling, then, depending on its boiling point, divided off.

135
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,760
The crude which boiled off at the lowest temperature, after treatment, will become propane, while

136
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,880
the oil with the highest boiling point will end up as asphalt.

137
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,840
While the exact traits of the oil, and the exact configuration of the refinery leads

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,200
to discrepancies from plant to plant, on average, each barrel of oil produces about 19 gallons

139
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,940
or 72 liters of car-grade gasoline.

140
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,820
In other words, about 45% of the crude sent through Valero's Wilmington Towers will

141
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,480
become gas.

142
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,980
Refining oil into gas isn't cheap—in fact, 18% of gas' price emanates from this step

143
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,340
alone.

144
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,640
After Valero's distilling towers separate the gasoline, it is then treated and blended

145
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,280
with additional ingredients like butane and ethanol, depending on the season and state

146
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,660
environmental regulations, before being transported by rail, pipeline, and trucks to gas stations.

147
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:10,200
Considering Southern California's rampant demand, there's a good chance that the gasoline

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,400
process just up from the Port of Los Angeles goes on to get consumed within a 100 mile

149
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
radius.

150
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,320
Nationally, this step, distribution and marketing, accounts for another 12% of gas' price at

151
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,500
the pump, and as any Californian will tell you, nearby refinement doesn't come with

152
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,440
any sort of local discount.

153
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,920
In fact, the state of California is home to the most expensive gas in the US.

154
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,160
While favorable geography explains its critical ports, it's also geography that explains

155
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,960
why its tankers, and practically only tankers, are supplying the state in the first place.

156
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:45,040
Separated for many American suppliers by the towering Rockies and Sierras, California is

157
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,640
effectively an energy island.

158
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,520
With rail shipping from areas as far away as the Bakken prohibitively expensive, and

159
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,900
pipeline projects both impractical and highly unpopular, California is nearly entirely reliant

160
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,840
on importing oil by ship.

161
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,320
But California's isolation isn't strictly geographical.

162
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,240
The state's gas is more expensive than even Hawaii's because the gas itself is physically

163
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,040
different, as California's uniquely strict environmental laws require additives like

164
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,560
methyl turt butyl ether or ethanol mixed in to ensure a cleaner burn.

165
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,980
Additionally, state fees for greenhouse gas initiatives and a higher state tax push California

166
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,740
gas prices higher than national averages.

167
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,040
And whether in California or not, taxes on gasoline contributed another major influence

168
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,060
on price, making up, on national average, 11% of consumer gas prices.

169
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:36,660
But as eye-popping as the state's prices may be, they represent a proportional climb

170
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,900
relative to the eye-popping California prices of yesteryear.

171
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,520
That's because while there are situational factors from state to state or country to

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,980
country that influence prices, those are often used as strawmen to point fingers at state

173
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,720
or national politicians.

174
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,860
These factors hardly change in the short-term, so it truly informs the swings, what makes

175
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,200
up 59% of the price of the pump is the price of the underlying commodity—the price of

176
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
oil itself.

177
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,360
This is a graph of 24 years of the world's total liquid fuels production, while this

178
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,260
represents 24 years of the world's total liquid fuels consumption.

179
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:13,560
By and large, the two lines match up quite closely—the world makes about as much fuel

180
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:19,660
as it consumes at any given moment—however, it's the minor mismatches that matter here.

181
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,100
Back in 07', a number of supply shocks occurred all at once—Venezuela cut off

182
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,600
sales to ExxonMobil, Scottish oil workers went on strike, Iraqi pipelines were destroyed

183
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,620
by saboteurs, Nigerian production was hampered by strikes and militant attacks—slowly and

184
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,900
unintentionally, the supply line slipped beneath the demand line.

185
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,260
Prices skyrocketed.

186
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,380
While only some of the spike can be attributed directly to supply, and not to ensuing speculation

187
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,820
and other market-based factors, the period demonstrated the sheer power of the law of

188
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,200
supply and demand in oil and gas.

189
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,220
Due to the inflexibility of consumption, with most unable to dramatically change their use

190
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:01,280
of fossil fuels in the short-term, small changes in supply lead to huge changes in price.

191
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,940
For cartels such as OPEC, with its unique ability to turn off the taps, this was hugely

192
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,300
valuable knowledge.

193
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,240
2008's rally was soon reversed by 2008's financial crisis, but prices steadily crept

194
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,860
up to a comfortably high level for oil companies as the world economy heated up in the early

195
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,160
2010s.

196
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,340
In North America, however, innovators were brewing up one of the most dramatic revolutions

197
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,540
in the oil industry's history.

198
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,400
Shale is a dense rock.

199
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Unlike the sand or limestone that typically hosts the oil that ends up at the pump, this

200
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,480
rock just isn't permeable enough for its hydrocarbons to flow out freely.

201
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,600
This fact long informed the mindset of oil and gas executives, who considered the countless

202
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,240
unexploited reservoirs of oil embedded within shale inaccessible—at least while turning

203
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
a profit.

204
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,640
But then came fracking.

205
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,160
By injecting a fluid at high pressures and boreholes dug deep through the ground, one

206
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,040
could create fissures in the rock out of which oil and natural gas flow freely.

207
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,840
Ignoring the countless externalities, this brought the cost of producing shale oil to

208
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,400
a competitive level, and thus began the Shale Revolution.

209
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,840
Two of the world's most significant shale deposits sit in the US—West Texas's Permian

210
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,280
Basin and Montana and North Dakota's Bakken Formation.

211
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,980
Conveniently, unlike with much of the rest of the world, oil and gas deposits beneath

212
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,020
the ground in the US are generally the property of the owner of said land, making the process

213
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,380
of requiring rights to drill far less centralized and state-controlled than with the rest of

214
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,380
the world.

215
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,580
Therefore, in the early 2010s, as fracking propagated, each of these areas experienced

216
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,980
a boom of gold rush proportions.

217
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,380
What was the quiet, 14,000-person agricultural community of Williston, North Dakota, doubled

218
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,540
in population across just four years.

219
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:43,300
Oil workers flew in from around the country to claim six-figure starting salaries, but

220
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,700
they had to deal with rent prices higher than those in Manhattan or San Francisco—$2,000

221
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,460
a month for a one-bedroom and far more for a nice one.

222
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,740
Everyone, from waiters to bartenders to cashiers to land-owning farmers, was making incredible

223
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,500
amounts of money as the industry refused to stop growing.

224
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:05,140
While the break-even price for shale oil was far higher than that of more traditional production

225
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,780
methods, the upfront investment was relatively low—it was far cheaper to construct a fracking

226
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,140
rig than an offshore oil rig, for example, so the boom was shepherded in not by Shell

227
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,980
or Chevron, but by small, independent operators.

228
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,980
These independent operators were too small to individually influence oil prices, but

229
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,260
in net, they flooded the market with supply.

230
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,620
Indicative of a boom time, operators were operating regardless of profitability—they

231
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,680
were willing to lose in the short-term to secure market share in the long-term because

232
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,740
they believed in the long-term potential.

233
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:39,020
But that long-term hardly shaped up as expected.

234
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:45,220
This supply glut was the major factor behind 2015's crash, and prices hardly recovered.

235
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,860
OPEC and Western supermajors had simply lost control of the market.

236
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,820
Oil was abundant, and, no matter how much they cut production, buyers found supply elsewhere.

237
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,940
Observers everywhere started to question whether this was the end of OPEC.

238
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,740
The cartel is only as good as the faith of its members in its effectiveness, and across

239
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,420
much of the 2010s, it was hardly looking effective.

240
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,020
But then came the before and after moment.

241
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,960
Then came negative oil prices.

242
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,520
Out of the most dramatic crash the industry had ever seen emerged an opportunity.

243
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,660
Operators everywhere cut back, including the independent American shale companies.

244
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,080
After slashing production faster and more deeply than ever before, OPEC brought back

245
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:34,260
supply slowly—crucially slower than demand—and therefore the industry entered the longest

246
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,620
sustained period of supply and demand mismatch since 2008.

247
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,720
Indigitivly, prices climbed at a far faster pace than demand's recovery, and OPEC once

248
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,460
again held control of the market—they once again became the entity that the world pointed

249
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,500
to as the culprit behind the prices at the pump.

250
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,960
But while broadly accurate, that would be an oversimplification.

251
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,420
Western producers, too, have been tepid in building production back up, and it shows

252
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,420
in the numbers.

253
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,260
US shale oil producers' reinvestment rate—as in, the share of cash flow going back into

254
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,220
the business rather than out to investors—is at an all-time low.

255
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,340
Whereas last time oil prices sat at a comparable level, the reinvestment rate was quite literally

256
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,580
off the charts, today, less than half of their money is being put back into the business.

257
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,780
This investment is typically what would go into developing new rigs, but today, it's

258
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,980
just getting paid out as profit.

259
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,780
Companies have the ability to produce more—the US Bureau of Land Management has exactly 9,000

260
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,540
approved but unused drilling permits on record—but companies just don't have the appetite to

261
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
drill.

262
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,200
Industry-wide, it's the same situation—Exxon Mobile, Shell, Chevron, and BP's capital

263
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,100
expenditures are each at or near all-time lows.

264
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,920
Simply put, oil companies are not investing in the future anymore—they're investing

265
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,540
in now.

266
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,780
This is not a misinformed strategy.

267
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,940
Out of the S&P 500 Index's 11 distinct sectors, the energy sector—made up almost exclusively

268
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,100
of oil and gas companies—has been by far the lowest performer since 2007.

269
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,780
The sector only gained 41.7% in value across that era, which means it was actually flat

270
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,980
with inflation.

271
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,380
The oil and gas industry simply is not a good investment anymore, and so it's no surprise

272
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,020
that it's not getting investment from outside or in.

273
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,980
While it's up to debate whether we've reached peak oil, it'd be much easier to

274
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,480
argue that we've reached peak oil investment.

275
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,400
Because of the temporary, finite nature of any oil supply, a relatively high level of

276
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,880
investment is needed just to keep production capacity stable.

277
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,760
When the world looked like this, when climbing oil demand was all we knew, the logic behind

278
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,360
investing $5.5 billion in a single pipeline was sound.

279
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,640
Now, with the world looking like this, with the future of demand looking less confident

280
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,400
than ever, even investing a couple tens of millions in a single fracking rig is risky.

281
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:01,080
Oil going negative appeared to spur a fundamental mindset change among oil executives and investors.

282
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,120
After having spent the past decades watching both the power of scarcity and the ruin of

283
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,720
abundance, supplies become the enemy.

284
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,680
Oil's under more pressure than ever to deliver profits now, because confidence in the future

285
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,000
has been lost.

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,120
ExxonMobil, Shell, Chevron, and BP each successfully posted record profits in 2021, and this can

287
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
continue.

288
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,720
The end of oil is near.

289
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,460
The momentum is already too strong—renewables are taking over—but the orchestra can keep

290
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,700
playing as the ship goes down.

291
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,440
In an era where there is no future industry growth to capture, scarcity is the name of

292
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
the game.

293
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,280
If oil companies keep supply tight, they'll keep prices high and capture consistent profits

294
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,320
even as they add to the incentives of renewables.

295
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,920
This appears to be the dominant strategy.

296
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:53,560
The alternative would be to keep prices low to slow down the switch, but considering the

297
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,640
driving force behind the transition is the prevention of the destruction of the planet,

298
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,940
rather than the search for a more cost-effective source of energy, the profit-focused approach

299
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,120
appears the most intuitive.

300
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,160
Astonishingly, this means that the oil industry is seeding the market—they've lost, they're

301
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,240
shepherding in renewables, but they're not going down without a fight.

302
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,680
Moving to a carbonless world will take time, and the oil industry can shrink faster than

303
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
renewables can grow.

304
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,120
Therefore, short of a fundamental strategy shift by one of the world's largest industries,

305
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,660
the era of high fuel prices is here to stay.

306
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:32,400
For those unable or unwilling to transition early, the wait will cost them.

307
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,380
For those who held onto ownership in the sector, they're starting to experience one last

308
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,840
great rally—because the oil industry's party at the end of the world just started.

309
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,720
As you may or may not have noticed, this video is really, secretly, a persuasive essay.

310
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,400
In fact, pretty much every video of mine is a persuasive essay.

311
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,180
No matter if I'm arguing that cyberwarfare is already a major threat, or that Russian

312
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,600
military logistics failed in Ukraine, or that the fine art market is a scam, I'm almost

313
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,520
always arguing something, and I'd also argue that a big reason behind the success of this

314
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,280
channel is my ability to do that effectively.

315
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,800
There are a lot of techniques that are objectively useful in trying to persuade someone of a

316
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,960
point, so I've gathered everything I've learned both by studying persuasive theory

317
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,840
in college and doing this for the past six years, and made a class about the theories

318
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,720
and techniques of persuasion.

319
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,440
And not only did I make a class, I made an online classes platform.

320
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Myself, my co-founders, and the incredible management, production, and engineering teams

321
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,400
behind Nebula have been working for much of the past year to bring you the platform's

322
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,980
biggest expansion to date—Nebula Classes.

323
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,620
We know that many of you want to learn more, and in more detail, from the educational creators

324
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,840
you already watch, so this is the platform for that.

325
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,200
In addition to mine, there are already other courses by Volksgeist, Amy Nolte, LowSpecGamer,

326
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,520
Georgia Dow, Thomas Frank, and others, and there will be new ones every single week.

327
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,440
Each is fantastically produced, with creators having flown out to a dedicated studio to

328
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,720
assure consistent quality.

329
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,840
Classes is available for just $10 a month or $100 a year, and that includes the over

330
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,400
10,000 videos and originals created by the curated list of 150 Nebula creators already.

331
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,440
However, for the tens of thousands of Wendover viewers that have already signed up for Nebula,

332
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,160
including through CuriosityStream, it's just $5 a month or $50 a year to upgrade.

334
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,160
