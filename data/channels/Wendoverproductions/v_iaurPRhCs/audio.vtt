00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.360
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.360 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.060 --> 00:23.420
bit more about our amazing world.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.140
With that, let's find this week's article.

00:26.140 --> 00:34.520
Oh, you know what, I know what this is, we're going to do this.

00:34.520 --> 00:38.140
So believe it or not, there is still land on earth that's not part of any country.

00:38.140 --> 00:40.740
Ber Tawil is that land.

00:40.740 --> 00:46.200
This 800 square mile area between Egypt and Sudan is claimed by neither Egypt nor Sudan.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.920
To understand why this is, we have to go back to 1899.

00:50.920 --> 00:54.760
At the turn of the 20th century, Britain had a large and rapidly expanding empire across

00:54.760 --> 00:55.880
the world.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.360
A large part of this empire was in Africa where colonialism had taken root.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.900
Britain held a complex level of authority in northeast Africa and through that they

01:03.900 --> 01:08.880
got to decide that the border between Sudan and Egypt was going to be the 22nd parallel.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.720
The problem with this border was that it made no consideration for the placement of actual

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
people.

01:13.720 --> 01:18.080
It just put a big line in the sand and arbitrarily split up tribes and people.

01:18.080 --> 01:23.420
In 1902, Britain decided to draw a new, administrative boundary that put into consideration the use

01:23.420 --> 01:25.920
of land by various tribes.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.880
That way, tribes wouldn't be living in one territory and grazing their cattle in another.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.360
Fast forward 114 years and both territories are now fully fledged countries, no longer

01:35.360 --> 01:37.160
under British rule.

01:37.160 --> 01:42.640
The problem is, Sudan now recognizes the 1902 administrative boundary as the real border

01:42.640 --> 01:49.080
while Egypt recognizes the 1899 border on the 22nd parallel as the real border.

01:49.080 --> 01:53.120
What this means is that Bir Tawil is south of Egypt's border, so Egypt thinks it's

01:53.120 --> 01:58.960
part of Sudan, while also north of Sudan's border, so Sudan thinks it's part of Egypt.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.000
This doesn't really create many problems though since there's a whopping zero people

02:03.000 --> 02:04.720
living in Bir Tawil.

02:04.720 --> 02:10.620
There's not even any roads or anything, it's just 800 square miles of nothing ruled

02:10.620 --> 02:13.780
by nobody.

02:13.780 --> 02:17.740
This same border issue does create issues in other places though.

02:17.740 --> 02:22.100
The Halaib Triangle is ten times bigger than Bir Tawil and instead of being claimed by

02:22.100 --> 02:24.900
no country, it's claimed by two countries.

02:24.900 --> 02:29.040
That's because it's north of what Egypt thinks is the border while simultaneously

02:29.040 --> 02:32.160
south of what Sudan thinks is the border.

02:32.160 --> 02:36.180
The two countries actually care about this piece of land because there are things.

02:36.260 --> 02:41.260
There's a road, and sea access, and 1,000 residents.

02:41.260 --> 02:46.780
Currently, the land is administered by Egypt, but let's get back to Bir Tawil.

02:46.780 --> 02:51.580
In his 2014 book, Alistair Bonnet said that Bir Tawil is, "...the only place on the

02:51.580 --> 02:55.360
planet that is both habitable and unclaimed."

02:55.360 --> 02:59.540
The biggest unclaimed piece of land is the Mary Bird Land, but that's not considered

02:59.540 --> 03:04.420
to be habitable land since, you know, it's in Antarctica.

03:04.420 --> 03:09.580
There's one other area of technically unclaimed land on the Danube River between Croatia and

03:09.580 --> 03:15.120
Serbia due to a similar border dispute, however, practically, the land, while on a map not

03:15.120 --> 03:18.940
part of either country, is well divided administratively.

03:18.940 --> 03:23.700
Therefore, Bir Tawil is the only place on earth where people might actually be able

03:23.700 --> 03:25.660
to create a new country.

03:25.660 --> 03:27.100
So what's stopping people?

03:27.100 --> 03:28.940
Well, not much.

03:28.940 --> 03:32.660
Scores of people have claimed the land as their own country, but if my video on how

03:32.660 --> 03:36.180
to create a country taught you anything, it's that it doesn't matter if you think

03:36.180 --> 03:40.280
you're a country, it matters if other people think you're a country.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.920
No recognized country currently recognizes any claim to Bir Tawil, likely because nobody

03:44.920 --> 03:49.220
has set up a government or permanent population in Bir Tawil.

03:49.220 --> 03:53.660
While the land is habitable, there's no infrastructure to bring in supplies to support

03:53.660 --> 03:55.260
a settlement.

03:55.260 --> 03:59.340
With it being a desert and all, agriculture doesn't do so well so any prospective country

03:59.340 --> 04:03.320
founder would need to build a road or airport to bring in food.

04:03.320 --> 04:07.880
In addition, there really aren't any natural resources so it's unlikely that any country

04:07.880 --> 04:11.700
established in the area would be self-sustaining economically.

04:11.700 --> 04:17.420
However, if someone was able to set up a democratic government in the area with a permanent population,

04:17.420 --> 04:22.020
it's entirely possible that they would gain recognition and there would be 197th country

04:22.020 --> 04:23.020
in the world.

04:23.020 --> 04:24.020
Or 194th.

04:24.020 --> 04:25.020
Or 193rd.

04:25.020 --> 04:27.980
Or it really just depends on who you ask.
