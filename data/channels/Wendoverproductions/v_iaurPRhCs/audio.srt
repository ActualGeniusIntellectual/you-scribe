00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,360
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,420
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,140
With that, let's find this week's article.

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:34,520
Oh, you know what, I know what this is, we're going to do this.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,140
So believe it or not, there is still land on earth that's not part of any country.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,740
Ber Tawil is that land.

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:46,200
This 800 square mile area between Egypt and Sudan is claimed by neither Egypt nor Sudan.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,920
To understand why this is, we have to go back to 1899.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,760
At the turn of the 20th century, Britain had a large and rapidly expanding empire across

16
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,880
the world.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,360
A large part of this empire was in Africa where colonialism had taken root.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,900
Britain held a complex level of authority in northeast Africa and through that they

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,880
got to decide that the border between Sudan and Egypt was going to be the 22nd parallel.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,720
The problem with this border was that it made no consideration for the placement of actual

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
people.

22
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,080
It just put a big line in the sand and arbitrarily split up tribes and people.

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,420
In 1902, Britain decided to draw a new, administrative boundary that put into consideration the use

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,920
of land by various tribes.

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,880
That way, tribes wouldn't be living in one territory and grazing their cattle in another.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,360
Fast forward 114 years and both territories are now fully fledged countries, no longer

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,160
under British rule.

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,640
The problem is, Sudan now recognizes the 1902 administrative boundary as the real border

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:49,080
while Egypt recognizes the 1899 border on the 22nd parallel as the real border.

30
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,120
What this means is that Bir Tawil is south of Egypt's border, so Egypt thinks it's

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,960
part of Sudan, while also north of Sudan's border, so Sudan thinks it's part of Egypt.

32
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,000
This doesn't really create many problems though since there's a whopping zero people

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,720
living in Bir Tawil.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,620
There's not even any roads or anything, it's just 800 square miles of nothing ruled

35
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,780
by nobody.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,740
This same border issue does create issues in other places though.

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,100
The Halaib Triangle is ten times bigger than Bir Tawil and instead of being claimed by

38
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,900
no country, it's claimed by two countries.

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,040
That's because it's north of what Egypt thinks is the border while simultaneously

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,160
south of what Sudan thinks is the border.

41
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,180
The two countries actually care about this piece of land because there are things.

42
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,260
There's a road, and sea access, and 1,000 residents.

43
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,780
Currently, the land is administered by Egypt, but let's get back to Bir Tawil.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,580
In his 2014 book, Alistair Bonnet said that Bir Tawil is, "...the only place on the

45
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,360
planet that is both habitable and unclaimed."

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,540
The biggest unclaimed piece of land is the Mary Bird Land, but that's not considered

47
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,420
to be habitable land since, you know, it's in Antarctica.

48
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,580
There's one other area of technically unclaimed land on the Danube River between Croatia and

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,120
Serbia due to a similar border dispute, however, practically, the land, while on a map not

50
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,940
part of either country, is well divided administratively.

51
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,700
Therefore, Bir Tawil is the only place on earth where people might actually be able

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,660
to create a new country.

53
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,100
So what's stopping people?

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,940
Well, not much.

55
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,660
Scores of people have claimed the land as their own country, but if my video on how

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,180
to create a country taught you anything, it's that it doesn't matter if you think

57
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,280
you're a country, it matters if other people think you're a country.

58
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,920
No recognized country currently recognizes any claim to Bir Tawil, likely because nobody

59
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,220
has set up a government or permanent population in Bir Tawil.

60
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,660
While the land is habitable, there's no infrastructure to bring in supplies to support

61
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,260
a settlement.

62
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,340
With it being a desert and all, agriculture doesn't do so well so any prospective country

63
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,320
founder would need to build a road or airport to bring in food.

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,880
In addition, there really aren't any natural resources so it's unlikely that any country

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,700
established in the area would be self-sustaining economically.

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,420
However, if someone was able to set up a democratic government in the area with a permanent population,

67
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:22,020
it's entirely possible that they would gain recognition and there would be 197th country

68
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,020
in the world.

69
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Or 194th.

70
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
Or 193rd.

71
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,980
Or it really just depends on who you ask.
