0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13360	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13360	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21060	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21060	23420	bit more about our amazing world.
23420	26140	With that, let's find this week's article.
26140	34520	Oh, you know what, I know what this is, we're going to do this.
34520	38140	So believe it or not, there is still land on earth that's not part of any country.
38140	40740	Ber Tawil is that land.
40740	46200	This 800 square mile area between Egypt and Sudan is claimed by neither Egypt nor Sudan.
46200	50920	To understand why this is, we have to go back to 1899.
50920	54760	At the turn of the 20th century, Britain had a large and rapidly expanding empire across
54760	55880	the world.
55880	60360	A large part of this empire was in Africa where colonialism had taken root.
60360	63900	Britain held a complex level of authority in northeast Africa and through that they
63900	68880	got to decide that the border between Sudan and Egypt was going to be the 22nd parallel.
68880	72720	The problem with this border was that it made no consideration for the placement of actual
72720	73720	people.
73720	78080	It just put a big line in the sand and arbitrarily split up tribes and people.
78080	83420	In 1902, Britain decided to draw a new, administrative boundary that put into consideration the use
83420	85920	of land by various tribes.
85920	90880	That way, tribes wouldn't be living in one territory and grazing their cattle in another.
90880	95360	Fast forward 114 years and both territories are now fully fledged countries, no longer
95360	97160	under British rule.
97160	102640	The problem is, Sudan now recognizes the 1902 administrative boundary as the real border
102640	109080	while Egypt recognizes the 1899 border on the 22nd parallel as the real border.
109080	113120	What this means is that Bir Tawil is south of Egypt's border, so Egypt thinks it's
113120	118960	part of Sudan, while also north of Sudan's border, so Sudan thinks it's part of Egypt.
118960	123000	This doesn't really create many problems though since there's a whopping zero people
123000	124720	living in Bir Tawil.
124720	130620	There's not even any roads or anything, it's just 800 square miles of nothing ruled
130620	133780	by nobody.
133780	137740	This same border issue does create issues in other places though.
137740	142100	The Halaib Triangle is ten times bigger than Bir Tawil and instead of being claimed by
142100	144900	no country, it's claimed by two countries.
144900	149040	That's because it's north of what Egypt thinks is the border while simultaneously
149040	152160	south of what Sudan thinks is the border.
152160	156180	The two countries actually care about this piece of land because there are things.
156260	161260	There's a road, and sea access, and 1,000 residents.
161260	166780	Currently, the land is administered by Egypt, but let's get back to Bir Tawil.
166780	171580	In his 2014 book, Alistair Bonnet said that Bir Tawil is, "...the only place on the
171580	175360	planet that is both habitable and unclaimed."
175360	179540	The biggest unclaimed piece of land is the Mary Bird Land, but that's not considered
179540	184420	to be habitable land since, you know, it's in Antarctica.
184420	189580	There's one other area of technically unclaimed land on the Danube River between Croatia and
189580	195120	Serbia due to a similar border dispute, however, practically, the land, while on a map not
195120	198940	part of either country, is well divided administratively.
198940	203700	Therefore, Bir Tawil is the only place on earth where people might actually be able
203700	205660	to create a new country.
205660	207100	So what's stopping people?
207100	208940	Well, not much.
208940	212660	Scores of people have claimed the land as their own country, but if my video on how
212660	216180	to create a country taught you anything, it's that it doesn't matter if you think
216180	220280	you're a country, it matters if other people think you're a country.
220280	224920	No recognized country currently recognizes any claim to Bir Tawil, likely because nobody
224920	229220	has set up a government or permanent population in Bir Tawil.
229220	233660	While the land is habitable, there's no infrastructure to bring in supplies to support
233660	235260	a settlement.
235260	239340	With it being a desert and all, agriculture doesn't do so well so any prospective country
239340	243320	founder would need to build a road or airport to bring in food.
243320	247880	In addition, there really aren't any natural resources so it's unlikely that any country
247880	251700	established in the area would be self-sustaining economically.
251700	257420	However, if someone was able to set up a democratic government in the area with a permanent population,
257420	262020	it's entirely possible that they would gain recognition and there would be 197th country
262020	263020	in the world.
263020	264020	Or 194th.
264020	265020	Or 193rd.
265020	267980	Or it really just depends on who you ask.
