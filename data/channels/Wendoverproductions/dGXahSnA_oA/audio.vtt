00:11.180 --> 00:13.920
Airlines are notoriously difficult businesses to run.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.840
Each and every flight operated is a multi-thousand dollar gamble on whether or not passengers

00:18.840 --> 00:20.360
will buy tickets.

00:20.360 --> 00:24.620
Aside from cost, the strongest factor for customers on which flight they will take is

00:24.620 --> 00:29.660
often the overall travel time so airlines put enormous effort into properly assembling

00:29.660 --> 00:34.160
their puzzle of flights so they can offer the shortest connection time possible.

00:34.160 --> 00:39.140
With so many destinations all across the world, it's just natural that most routes require

00:39.140 --> 00:43.860
connections, so airlines need to attract connecting passengers in order to stay in business.

00:43.860 --> 00:48.260
Now, most flight connections for traditional airlines happen out of their hub airports.

00:48.260 --> 00:53.020
American Airlines, for example, has ten across the United States and every single one of

00:53.020 --> 00:58.300
their flights either begins or ends at these airports, but not all hubs are created equal.

00:58.300 --> 01:02.600
Charlotte Douglas, Reagan National, and LaGuardia are largely built for north-south traffic

01:02.600 --> 01:06.740
and terminating traffic, Miami is for connecting north American travelers to flights to the

01:06.740 --> 01:11.300
Caribbean and South America, Philadelphia is a bit of a hybrid hub connecting both north-south

01:11.300 --> 01:15.700
traffic and north American traffic onto flights to Europe, JFK is the major hub for connecting

01:15.700 --> 01:19.580
north American traffic to European flights, and the Los Angeles hub's main purpose is

01:19.580 --> 01:23.620
to connect north American traffic to Asia and Oceania bound flights, but then there

01:23.620 --> 01:28.860
are these three—Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airports.

01:28.860 --> 01:32.500
These three airports are the truly important connection airports since they lie between

01:32.500 --> 01:35.140
the coasts and their schedules reflect this.

01:35.140 --> 01:39.740
The east-west routes are the most competitive in the United States so American has to offer

01:39.740 --> 01:42.580
short connections in order to dominate the market.

01:42.580 --> 01:46.700
So, what American Airlines has done is that they've banked their hubs.

01:46.700 --> 01:51.740
What this means is that, for the most part, all their flights arrive and depart at roughly

01:51.740 --> 01:53.240
the same time.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.020
For example, on any given Wednesday in the fall, the Philadelphia flight will arrive

01:57.020 --> 02:03.360
at 11.14 am, then the Atlanta flight at 11.17 am, the DC one at 11.29, and the Nashville

02:03.360 --> 02:05.560
flight at 11.45.

02:05.560 --> 02:10.640
Then at 12.40 the flight to Denver leaves, then at 12.45 the one in Las Vegas, at 1.00

02:10.640 --> 02:14.520
the one to San Francisco, and at 1.10 the flight to Los Angeles.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.880
This way, nobody has to wait for longer than two hours to connect.

02:18.880 --> 02:24.000
Almost every flight American operates in and out of DFW falls into one of their ten

02:24.000 --> 02:25.280
daily banks.

02:25.280 --> 02:29.720
This is how the airline gets those connecting passengers—by offering shorter connection

02:29.720 --> 02:30.720
times.

02:30.720 --> 02:36.040
Nearby Dallas Love Field is Southwest Airlines' main hub, but it operates in an entirely different

02:36.040 --> 02:37.040
way.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.200
It just has planes arriving and leaving at a consistent average of about 8 to 12 flights

02:41.200 --> 02:47.640
per hour all day long and there's a good reason for this—Southwest is a budget airline.

02:47.640 --> 02:53.000
Banked hubs are significantly more expensive to run because they require more resources.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.420
The airline needs to have enough equipment, people, and gates to turn around all their

02:57.420 --> 02:59.640
planes at the same time.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.840
If the planes came in at a smooth pace, all the people and equipment could be used continuously

03:04.840 --> 03:08.840
but at a banked hub the airline still needs to pay for the people and equipment during

03:08.840 --> 03:10.960
the downtime between the banks.

03:10.960 --> 03:16.680
If a plane leaves Philadelphia bound for DC at 9.30 with a 9 to 10 am bank it will arrive

03:16.720 --> 03:22.040
around 10 am, but it will have to wait to leave until about 11.15 to time its arrival

03:22.040 --> 03:25.300
with the 11.45 to 12.45 bank.

03:25.300 --> 03:29.380
Planes cost money whether they're in the air or sitting on the ground so having planes

03:29.380 --> 03:32.560
wait around to time with banks costs money too.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.360
This is why a budget airline will never schedule their planes to sit on the ground during the

03:36.360 --> 03:38.080
day for more than an hour.

03:38.080 --> 03:43.300
Once a plane lands, it immediately loads up and takes off again as soon as possible.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.900
For this reason, the planes of a budget airline like Spirit Airlines are in the air for an

03:47.900 --> 03:52.980
average of 11 hours per day while American Airlines only uses their planes for an average

03:52.980 --> 03:55.260
of 8.5 hours per day.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.860
Banks hubs can also make delays more probable.

03:57.860 --> 04:01.560
When there are so many planes going out at once an airport might just not be able to

04:01.560 --> 04:03.380
cope with a surge in activity.

04:03.380 --> 04:07.860
If a thunderstorm hits an airport, for example, a whole bank of flights might be delayed or

04:07.860 --> 04:12.020
cancelled which would create a knock-on effect all across the country.

04:12.020 --> 04:17.140
These banking systems are essentially higher risk, higher reward in terms of delays, but

04:17.140 --> 04:21.140
some airlines have taken the banked hub concept to an extreme.

04:21.140 --> 04:27.140
Etihad Airways' hub in Abu Dhabi essentially operates with just two big banks a day.

04:27.140 --> 04:31.860
Almost all their flights from the west arrive between 7 and 8.30 pm then eastbound flights

04:31.860 --> 04:34.860
depart between 9.30 and 10.30 pm.

04:34.860 --> 04:39.540
Flights coming in from the east land between about 11.30 pm and 12.30 am and then the final

04:39.540 --> 04:44.240
bank of westbound flights departs between 2 and 3.30 am.

04:44.240 --> 04:48.660
With this system, almost every flight from Europe or the US can connect to a flight to

04:48.660 --> 04:52.400
Asia or Australia in no more than two hours.

04:52.400 --> 04:57.780
The whole operation also takes about 8 and a half hours—perfectly timed for one work

04:57.780 --> 04:58.780
shift.

04:58.780 --> 05:03.080
But of course, however, this leads to a lot of planes sitting around.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.900
Their flight to Hong Kong, for example, departs at 9.50 pm Abu Dhabi time and arrives at 10.05

05:08.900 --> 05:10.380
am Hong Kong time.

05:10.380 --> 05:16.180
The plane then has to sit around until 6.55 pm in order to time its arrival with the rest

05:16.180 --> 05:17.460
of the westbound bank.

05:17.460 --> 05:22.300
That's almost nine hours of waiting, but in order to schedule flights correctly, it's

05:22.300 --> 05:25.440
fairly typical for planes to sit around.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.540
Flights from north to south America are notoriously difficult to schedule.

05:29.540 --> 05:34.300
Sao Paulo, Brazil is only one hour ahead of New York during daylight saving time so southbound

05:34.300 --> 05:38.340
flights tend to leave in the evening and arrive 10 hours later in the morning.

05:38.340 --> 05:41.140
But the tricky part is when the flight should return.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.140
If the flight left at 7 pm and arrived the following morning at 6 am it could turn around

05:45.140 --> 05:50.020
and fly back at 9 am and arrive at 6 pm but the airline doesn't want to do that.

05:50.020 --> 05:54.420
The problem is that airlines rely heavily on connecting traffic to fill their flights

05:54.420 --> 05:58.380
and by the time arriving travelers got off the plane and made it through customs it would

05:58.380 --> 06:04.220
be 7.30 pm at best by which time the majority of flights have left for the night.

06:04.220 --> 06:08.640
Airlines therefore almost universally decide to leave their planes on the ground in south

06:08.640 --> 06:14.460
America all day to fly back overnight so travelers can connect onwards to their final destination

06:14.460 --> 06:15.860
on morning flights.

06:15.860 --> 06:20.780
This is likely part of the reason why flights from north to south America are so expensive,

06:20.780 --> 06:25.660
but some of the airlines have found a way to take advantage of the time on the ground.

06:25.660 --> 06:30.380
Labor is significantly cheaper in south America so airlines have started to perform maintenance

06:30.380 --> 06:34.460
work on planes while they're waiting around for the evening flight back.

06:34.460 --> 06:40.780
American Airlines, for example, recently started building a $100 million hanger in Sao Paulo

06:40.780 --> 06:43.260
to support their maintenance operations there.

06:43.260 --> 06:47.860
Qantas made a similar move to take advantage of time on the ground by opening up an A380

06:47.860 --> 06:51.620
sized maintenance hanger in Los Angeles for their planes that sometimes sit there for

06:51.620 --> 06:56.420
up to 14 hours but that's not the only trick Qantas has up its sleeves.

06:56.420 --> 07:01.380
Australia is just so isolated that no plane can currently fly non-stop from the country

07:01.380 --> 07:03.220
to the US east coast.

07:03.220 --> 07:08.460
The US west coast, however, is close enough that a plane can make it in a 12-14 hour flight

07:08.460 --> 07:13.660
so Qantas has non-stop flights from Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane to Los Angeles.

07:13.660 --> 07:18.780
The trick is that they are all scheduled to arrive between about 6 and 6.30 am then, at

07:18.780 --> 07:23.980
8.20 am, one of the planes continues on to New York with the passengers booked through.

07:23.980 --> 07:26.380
This is known as a scissor hub.

07:26.380 --> 07:30.700
WestJet operates an even more advanced one in St. John's, Canada.

07:30.700 --> 07:36.140
They have flights arriving from Orlando, Toronto, and Ottawa all around 9.30 to 10 pm then just

07:36.140 --> 07:39.340
past 11 their flights to Dublin and London leave.

07:39.340 --> 07:44.420
This way, they can fly six routes with just three planes and, even better for them, since

07:44.420 --> 07:48.100
it's only a four and a half hour flight from St. John's to the British Isles they

07:48.100 --> 07:53.260
can fly small, inexpensive, single-aisle planes transatlantic.

07:53.260 --> 07:57.180
All of these schedule patterns and tricks serve to help an airline achieve its ultimate

07:57.180 --> 07:59.660
goal—to maximize revenue.

07:59.660 --> 08:04.460
In this industry, time truly is money since planes cost money and people pay more to fly

08:04.460 --> 08:13.880
faster so few aspects of the business are as important as properly scheduling flights.

08:13.880 --> 08:17.740
If you like spending less time at airports one way is to fly with shorter connections

08:17.740 --> 08:20.360
but perhaps the easiest way is to use clear.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.320
I tried them out for myself on a recent trip and the footage speaks for itself.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.980
Clear uses biometrics to replace the TSA ID check so you always go straight to either

08:28.980 --> 08:32.200
the pre-check or regular screening without waiting in line.

08:32.200 --> 08:37.020
As you can see here, it took me exactly one minute and seven seconds to go from walking

08:37.020 --> 08:40.160
in the door of LaGuardia to getting into security.

08:40.160 --> 08:43.720
The x-ray was completely backed up with a few people in wheelchairs when I went through

08:43.720 --> 08:47.680
but that's actually a good thing because what I am showing you here is the absolute

08:47.680 --> 08:51.120
worst case scenario—the slowest security with clear will be.

08:51.120 --> 08:55.400
I put my camera in my bag during the screening so the TSA agents would yell at me but the

08:55.400 --> 08:57.320
timer is still running.

08:57.320 --> 09:02.000
So, even with all that backup at the x-ray, I went from walking through the door to the

09:02.000 --> 09:04.580
gate in seven minutes.

09:04.580 --> 09:10.060
