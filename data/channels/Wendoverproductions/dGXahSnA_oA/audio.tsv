11180	13920	Airlines are notoriously difficult businesses to run.
13920	18840	Each and every flight operated is a multi-thousand dollar gamble on whether or not passengers
18840	20360	will buy tickets.
20360	24620	Aside from cost, the strongest factor for customers on which flight they will take is
24620	29660	often the overall travel time so airlines put enormous effort into properly assembling
29660	34160	their puzzle of flights so they can offer the shortest connection time possible.
34160	39140	With so many destinations all across the world, it's just natural that most routes require
39140	43860	connections, so airlines need to attract connecting passengers in order to stay in business.
43860	48260	Now, most flight connections for traditional airlines happen out of their hub airports.
48260	53020	American Airlines, for example, has ten across the United States and every single one of
53020	58300	their flights either begins or ends at these airports, but not all hubs are created equal.
58300	62600	Charlotte Douglas, Reagan National, and LaGuardia are largely built for north-south traffic
62600	66740	and terminating traffic, Miami is for connecting north American travelers to flights to the
66740	71300	Caribbean and South America, Philadelphia is a bit of a hybrid hub connecting both north-south
71300	75700	traffic and north American traffic onto flights to Europe, JFK is the major hub for connecting
75700	79580	north American traffic to European flights, and the Los Angeles hub's main purpose is
79580	83620	to connect north American traffic to Asia and Oceania bound flights, but then there
83620	88860	are these three—Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airports.
88860	92500	These three airports are the truly important connection airports since they lie between
92500	95140	the coasts and their schedules reflect this.
95140	99740	The east-west routes are the most competitive in the United States so American has to offer
99740	102580	short connections in order to dominate the market.
102580	106700	So, what American Airlines has done is that they've banked their hubs.
106700	111740	What this means is that, for the most part, all their flights arrive and depart at roughly
111740	113240	the same time.
113240	117020	For example, on any given Wednesday in the fall, the Philadelphia flight will arrive
117020	123360	at 11.14 am, then the Atlanta flight at 11.17 am, the DC one at 11.29, and the Nashville
123360	125560	flight at 11.45.
125560	130640	Then at 12.40 the flight to Denver leaves, then at 12.45 the one in Las Vegas, at 1.00
130640	134520	the one to San Francisco, and at 1.10 the flight to Los Angeles.
134520	138880	This way, nobody has to wait for longer than two hours to connect.
138880	144000	Almost every flight American operates in and out of DFW falls into one of their ten
144000	145280	daily banks.
145280	149720	This is how the airline gets those connecting passengers—by offering shorter connection
149720	150720	times.
150720	156040	Nearby Dallas Love Field is Southwest Airlines' main hub, but it operates in an entirely different
156040	157040	way.
157040	161200	It just has planes arriving and leaving at a consistent average of about 8 to 12 flights
161200	167640	per hour all day long and there's a good reason for this—Southwest is a budget airline.
167640	173000	Banked hubs are significantly more expensive to run because they require more resources.
173000	177420	The airline needs to have enough equipment, people, and gates to turn around all their
177420	179640	planes at the same time.
179640	184840	If the planes came in at a smooth pace, all the people and equipment could be used continuously
184840	188840	but at a banked hub the airline still needs to pay for the people and equipment during
188840	190960	the downtime between the banks.
190960	196680	If a plane leaves Philadelphia bound for DC at 9.30 with a 9 to 10 am bank it will arrive
196720	202040	around 10 am, but it will have to wait to leave until about 11.15 to time its arrival
202040	205300	with the 11.45 to 12.45 bank.
205300	209380	Planes cost money whether they're in the air or sitting on the ground so having planes
209380	212560	wait around to time with banks costs money too.
212560	216360	This is why a budget airline will never schedule their planes to sit on the ground during the
216360	218080	day for more than an hour.
218080	223300	Once a plane lands, it immediately loads up and takes off again as soon as possible.
223300	227900	For this reason, the planes of a budget airline like Spirit Airlines are in the air for an
227900	232980	average of 11 hours per day while American Airlines only uses their planes for an average
232980	235260	of 8.5 hours per day.
235260	237860	Banks hubs can also make delays more probable.
237860	241560	When there are so many planes going out at once an airport might just not be able to
241560	243380	cope with a surge in activity.
243380	247860	If a thunderstorm hits an airport, for example, a whole bank of flights might be delayed or
247860	252020	cancelled which would create a knock-on effect all across the country.
252020	257140	These banking systems are essentially higher risk, higher reward in terms of delays, but
257140	261140	some airlines have taken the banked hub concept to an extreme.
261140	267140	Etihad Airways' hub in Abu Dhabi essentially operates with just two big banks a day.
267140	271860	Almost all their flights from the west arrive between 7 and 8.30 pm then eastbound flights
271860	274860	depart between 9.30 and 10.30 pm.
274860	279540	Flights coming in from the east land between about 11.30 pm and 12.30 am and then the final
279540	284240	bank of westbound flights departs between 2 and 3.30 am.
284240	288660	With this system, almost every flight from Europe or the US can connect to a flight to
288660	292400	Asia or Australia in no more than two hours.
292400	297780	The whole operation also takes about 8 and a half hours—perfectly timed for one work
297780	298780	shift.
298780	303080	But of course, however, this leads to a lot of planes sitting around.
303080	308900	Their flight to Hong Kong, for example, departs at 9.50 pm Abu Dhabi time and arrives at 10.05
308900	310380	am Hong Kong time.
310380	316180	The plane then has to sit around until 6.55 pm in order to time its arrival with the rest
316180	317460	of the westbound bank.
317460	322300	That's almost nine hours of waiting, but in order to schedule flights correctly, it's
322300	325440	fairly typical for planes to sit around.
325440	329540	Flights from north to south America are notoriously difficult to schedule.
329540	334300	Sao Paulo, Brazil is only one hour ahead of New York during daylight saving time so southbound
334300	338340	flights tend to leave in the evening and arrive 10 hours later in the morning.
338340	341140	But the tricky part is when the flight should return.
341140	345140	If the flight left at 7 pm and arrived the following morning at 6 am it could turn around
345140	350020	and fly back at 9 am and arrive at 6 pm but the airline doesn't want to do that.
350020	354420	The problem is that airlines rely heavily on connecting traffic to fill their flights
354420	358380	and by the time arriving travelers got off the plane and made it through customs it would
358380	364220	be 7.30 pm at best by which time the majority of flights have left for the night.
364220	368640	Airlines therefore almost universally decide to leave their planes on the ground in south
368640	374460	America all day to fly back overnight so travelers can connect onwards to their final destination
374460	375860	on morning flights.
375860	380780	This is likely part of the reason why flights from north to south America are so expensive,
380780	385660	but some of the airlines have found a way to take advantage of the time on the ground.
385660	390380	Labor is significantly cheaper in south America so airlines have started to perform maintenance
390380	394460	work on planes while they're waiting around for the evening flight back.
394460	400780	American Airlines, for example, recently started building a $100 million hanger in Sao Paulo
400780	403260	to support their maintenance operations there.
403260	407860	Qantas made a similar move to take advantage of time on the ground by opening up an A380
407860	411620	sized maintenance hanger in Los Angeles for their planes that sometimes sit there for
411620	416420	up to 14 hours but that's not the only trick Qantas has up its sleeves.
416420	421380	Australia is just so isolated that no plane can currently fly non-stop from the country
421380	423220	to the US east coast.
423220	428460	The US west coast, however, is close enough that a plane can make it in a 12-14 hour flight
428460	433660	so Qantas has non-stop flights from Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane to Los Angeles.
433660	438780	The trick is that they are all scheduled to arrive between about 6 and 6.30 am then, at
438780	443980	8.20 am, one of the planes continues on to New York with the passengers booked through.
443980	446380	This is known as a scissor hub.
446380	450700	WestJet operates an even more advanced one in St. John's, Canada.
450700	456140	They have flights arriving from Orlando, Toronto, and Ottawa all around 9.30 to 10 pm then just
456140	459340	past 11 their flights to Dublin and London leave.
459340	464420	This way, they can fly six routes with just three planes and, even better for them, since
464420	468100	it's only a four and a half hour flight from St. John's to the British Isles they
468100	473260	can fly small, inexpensive, single-aisle planes transatlantic.
473260	477180	All of these schedule patterns and tricks serve to help an airline achieve its ultimate
477180	479660	goal—to maximize revenue.
479660	484460	In this industry, time truly is money since planes cost money and people pay more to fly
484460	493880	faster so few aspects of the business are as important as properly scheduling flights.
493880	497740	If you like spending less time at airports one way is to fly with shorter connections
497740	500360	but perhaps the easiest way is to use clear.
500360	504320	I tried them out for myself on a recent trip and the footage speaks for itself.
504320	508980	Clear uses biometrics to replace the TSA ID check so you always go straight to either
508980	512200	the pre-check or regular screening without waiting in line.
512200	517020	As you can see here, it took me exactly one minute and seven seconds to go from walking
517020	520160	in the door of LaGuardia to getting into security.
520160	523720	The x-ray was completely backed up with a few people in wheelchairs when I went through
523720	527680	but that's actually a good thing because what I am showing you here is the absolute
527680	531120	worst case scenario—the slowest security with clear will be.
531120	535400	I put my camera in my bag during the screening so the TSA agents would yell at me but the
535400	537320	timer is still running.
537320	542000	So, even with all that backup at the x-ray, I went from walking through the door to the
542000	544580	gate in seven minutes.
