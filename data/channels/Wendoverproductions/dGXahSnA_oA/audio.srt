4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,920
Airlines are notoriously difficult businesses to run.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,840
Each and every flight operated is a multi-thousand dollar gamble on whether or not passengers

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,360
will buy tickets.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,620
Aside from cost, the strongest factor for customers on which flight they will take is

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,660
often the overall travel time so airlines put enormous effort into properly assembling

9
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:34,160
their puzzle of flights so they can offer the shortest connection time possible.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,140
With so many destinations all across the world, it's just natural that most routes require

11
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,860
connections, so airlines need to attract connecting passengers in order to stay in business.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,260
Now, most flight connections for traditional airlines happen out of their hub airports.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,020
American Airlines, for example, has ten across the United States and every single one of

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,300
their flights either begins or ends at these airports, but not all hubs are created equal.

15
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,600
Charlotte Douglas, Reagan National, and LaGuardia are largely built for north-south traffic

16
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,740
and terminating traffic, Miami is for connecting north American travelers to flights to the

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,300
Caribbean and South America, Philadelphia is a bit of a hybrid hub connecting both north-south

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,700
traffic and north American traffic onto flights to Europe, JFK is the major hub for connecting

19
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,580
north American traffic to European flights, and the Los Angeles hub's main purpose is

20
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,620
to connect north American traffic to Asia and Oceania bound flights, but then there

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,860
are these three—Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airports.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,500
These three airports are the truly important connection airports since they lie between

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,140
the coasts and their schedules reflect this.

24
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:39,740
The east-west routes are the most competitive in the United States so American has to offer

25
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,580
short connections in order to dominate the market.

26
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,700
So, what American Airlines has done is that they've banked their hubs.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,740
What this means is that, for the most part, all their flights arrive and depart at roughly

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,240
the same time.

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,020
For example, on any given Wednesday in the fall, the Philadelphia flight will arrive

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,360
at 11.14 am, then the Atlanta flight at 11.17 am, the DC one at 11.29, and the Nashville

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,560
flight at 11.45.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,640
Then at 12.40 the flight to Denver leaves, then at 12.45 the one in Las Vegas, at 1.00

33
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,520
the one to San Francisco, and at 1.10 the flight to Los Angeles.

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,880
This way, nobody has to wait for longer than two hours to connect.

35
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,000
Almost every flight American operates in and out of DFW falls into one of their ten

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,280
daily banks.

37
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,720
This is how the airline gets those connecting passengers—by offering shorter connection

38
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
times.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,040
Nearby Dallas Love Field is Southwest Airlines' main hub, but it operates in an entirely different

40
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
way.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,200
It just has planes arriving and leaving at a consistent average of about 8 to 12 flights

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,640
per hour all day long and there's a good reason for this—Southwest is a budget airline.

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,000
Banked hubs are significantly more expensive to run because they require more resources.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,420
The airline needs to have enough equipment, people, and gates to turn around all their

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,640
planes at the same time.

46
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,840
If the planes came in at a smooth pace, all the people and equipment could be used continuously

47
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,840
but at a banked hub the airline still needs to pay for the people and equipment during

48
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,960
the downtime between the banks.

49
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,680
If a plane leaves Philadelphia bound for DC at 9.30 with a 9 to 10 am bank it will arrive

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,040
around 10 am, but it will have to wait to leave until about 11.15 to time its arrival

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,300
with the 11.45 to 12.45 bank.

52
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,380
Planes cost money whether they're in the air or sitting on the ground so having planes

53
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,560
wait around to time with banks costs money too.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,360
This is why a budget airline will never schedule their planes to sit on the ground during the

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,080
day for more than an hour.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,300
Once a plane lands, it immediately loads up and takes off again as soon as possible.

57
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,900
For this reason, the planes of a budget airline like Spirit Airlines are in the air for an

58
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,980
average of 11 hours per day while American Airlines only uses their planes for an average

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,260
of 8.5 hours per day.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,860
Banks hubs can also make delays more probable.

61
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,560
When there are so many planes going out at once an airport might just not be able to

62
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,380
cope with a surge in activity.

63
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,860
If a thunderstorm hits an airport, for example, a whole bank of flights might be delayed or

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,020
cancelled which would create a knock-on effect all across the country.

65
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,140
These banking systems are essentially higher risk, higher reward in terms of delays, but

66
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,140
some airlines have taken the banked hub concept to an extreme.

67
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Etihad Airways' hub in Abu Dhabi essentially operates with just two big banks a day.

68
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,860
Almost all their flights from the west arrive between 7 and 8.30 pm then eastbound flights

69
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
depart between 9.30 and 10.30 pm.

70
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,540
Flights coming in from the east land between about 11.30 pm and 12.30 am and then the final

71
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,240
bank of westbound flights departs between 2 and 3.30 am.

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,660
With this system, almost every flight from Europe or the US can connect to a flight to

73
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,400
Asia or Australia in no more than two hours.

74
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,780
The whole operation also takes about 8 and a half hours—perfectly timed for one work

75
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
shift.

76
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,080
But of course, however, this leads to a lot of planes sitting around.

77
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,900
Their flight to Hong Kong, for example, departs at 9.50 pm Abu Dhabi time and arrives at 10.05

78
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,380
am Hong Kong time.

79
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:16,180
The plane then has to sit around until 6.55 pm in order to time its arrival with the rest

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,460
of the westbound bank.

81
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,300
That's almost nine hours of waiting, but in order to schedule flights correctly, it's

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,440
fairly typical for planes to sit around.

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,540
Flights from north to south America are notoriously difficult to schedule.

84
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,300
Sao Paulo, Brazil is only one hour ahead of New York during daylight saving time so southbound

85
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,340
flights tend to leave in the evening and arrive 10 hours later in the morning.

86
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,140
But the tricky part is when the flight should return.

87
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,140
If the flight left at 7 pm and arrived the following morning at 6 am it could turn around

88
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,020
and fly back at 9 am and arrive at 6 pm but the airline doesn't want to do that.

89
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,420
The problem is that airlines rely heavily on connecting traffic to fill their flights

90
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,380
and by the time arriving travelers got off the plane and made it through customs it would

91
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,220
be 7.30 pm at best by which time the majority of flights have left for the night.

92
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,640
Airlines therefore almost universally decide to leave their planes on the ground in south

93
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,460
America all day to fly back overnight so travelers can connect onwards to their final destination

94
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,860
on morning flights.

95
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,780
This is likely part of the reason why flights from north to south America are so expensive,

96
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,660
but some of the airlines have found a way to take advantage of the time on the ground.

97
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,380
Labor is significantly cheaper in south America so airlines have started to perform maintenance

98
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,460
work on planes while they're waiting around for the evening flight back.

99
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,780
American Airlines, for example, recently started building a $100 million hanger in Sao Paulo

100
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,260
to support their maintenance operations there.

101
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,860
Qantas made a similar move to take advantage of time on the ground by opening up an A380

102
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,620
sized maintenance hanger in Los Angeles for their planes that sometimes sit there for

103
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,420
up to 14 hours but that's not the only trick Qantas has up its sleeves.

104
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,380
Australia is just so isolated that no plane can currently fly non-stop from the country

105
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,220
to the US east coast.

106
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,460
The US west coast, however, is close enough that a plane can make it in a 12-14 hour flight

107
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,660
so Qantas has non-stop flights from Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane to Los Angeles.

108
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,780
The trick is that they are all scheduled to arrive between about 6 and 6.30 am then, at

109
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,980
8.20 am, one of the planes continues on to New York with the passengers booked through.

110
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,380
This is known as a scissor hub.

111
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,700
WestJet operates an even more advanced one in St. John's, Canada.

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,140
They have flights arriving from Orlando, Toronto, and Ottawa all around 9.30 to 10 pm then just

113
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,340
past 11 their flights to Dublin and London leave.

114
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,420
This way, they can fly six routes with just three planes and, even better for them, since

115
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:48,100
it's only a four and a half hour flight from St. John's to the British Isles they

116
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,260
can fly small, inexpensive, single-aisle planes transatlantic.

117
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,180
All of these schedule patterns and tricks serve to help an airline achieve its ultimate

118
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,660
goal—to maximize revenue.

119
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,460
In this industry, time truly is money since planes cost money and people pay more to fly

120
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:13,880
faster so few aspects of the business are as important as properly scheduling flights.

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,740
If you like spending less time at airports one way is to fly with shorter connections

122
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,360
but perhaps the easiest way is to use clear.

123
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,320
I tried them out for myself on a recent trip and the footage speaks for itself.

124
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,980
Clear uses biometrics to replace the TSA ID check so you always go straight to either

125
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,200
the pre-check or regular screening without waiting in line.

126
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,020
As you can see here, it took me exactly one minute and seven seconds to go from walking

127
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,160
in the door of LaGuardia to getting into security.

128
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,720
The x-ray was completely backed up with a few people in wheelchairs when I went through

129
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,680
but that's actually a good thing because what I am showing you here is the absolute

130
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,120
worst case scenario—the slowest security with clear will be.

131
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,400
I put my camera in my bag during the screening so the TSA agents would yell at me but the

132
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,320
timer is still running.

133
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,000
So, even with all that backup at the x-ray, I went from walking through the door to the

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,580
gate in seven minutes.

135
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,060
The good news is that the first 200 people to sign up over at clearme.com slash wendover

136
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,480
get to speed through airport security at Clear's 24 US airports for free for three months.

137
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
This is not a publicly available trial so it's worth signing up while it's available.

138
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:28,000
Once again, that's clearme.com slash wendover for three free months of faster airport security.
