1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
The 8.9 mile gap between the European and African continent known as the Strait of Gibraltar

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,680
is home to multiple strange territories and borders.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,900
On the European side, there's a 2.6 square mile British overseas territory named Gibraltar.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,600
This means that Britain shares a small land border with Spain.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,640
On the African side of the Strait is the Spanish city of Ceuta, separated completely from the

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,640
rest of Spain.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,200
This city is an autonomous community within Spain essentially having similar rights as

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,800
the independent regions that make up Spain.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,200
A little more than 100 miles down the African coast is Mejia, another Spanish exclave in

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,720
Northern Africa.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,480
All this means that Spain shares significant land borders with Morocco and that in effect

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,300
only one country separates British soil from African soil.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,560
Two other European countries also have strange border relations.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,000
Conventional wisdom would say that the Netherlands and France do not share land border.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,720
Belgium stands between the two countries, however, on the other side of the world, the

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,640
two countries do share a border.

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,080
The Caribbean island of Saint Martin is split between a French collectivity, Saint Martin,

18
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,680
and a Dutch constituent colony, Saint Martin, meaning that you can walk from France to the

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,800
Netherlands without crossing through another country.

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,920
Also part of France is French Guiana.

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,520
French Guiana has the exact same political power as any other French department and region

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,960
despite being on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,200
It has a comparable relationship as Hawaii to the United States, geographically separated

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,000
but politically integrated.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,440
This means that France shares a land border with both Brazil and Suriname.

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,180
There are two daily flights from French Guiana to Paris which make for one of the longest

27
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,120
domestic flights in the world.

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,000
These flights take off in France and land in France but take 9 hours and cross 4,401

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
miles.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,580
Despite this, this is not the longest domestic flight in the world.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,980
The longest is also within France and goes from Paris to the French overseas department

32
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,740
of RÃ©union, located in the Indian Ocean.

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,900
The flight is 5,809 miles long and takes just over 11 hours.

34
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,180
And over to North America, it's impossible to walk or drive from New York to LA without

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,740
crossing over water.

36
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:11,740
The Saint Lawrence River connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, then the Chicago

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,020
River connects to the DePlains River, which connects to the Illinois River, which connects

38
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,100
to the Mississippi River, which flows out into the Gulf of Mexico.

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,740
It's also impossible to go from the south to the north of the US without crossing water.

40
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,000
There's one creek in the Teton Wilderness of Wyoming that divides at a place called

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,780
the Parting of the Waters.

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,980
One side flows 3,488 miles to the Atlantic while the other 1,353 miles to the Pacific.

43
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,300
This means that this is one of the few natural waterways connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.

44
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,700
Near those Great Lakes that make up part of the water split is Middle Island in Canada,

45
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,100
the southernmost point in Canada.

46
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,440
A majority of US states, 27, actually lie fully or partially north of this point.

47
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,420
The closest point in Europe to the US is the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland, only 2,539 miles

48
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,080
away from Hamel, Maine.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,880
The island of Ireland is politically divided between the autonomous country of the Republic

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,420
of Ireland and the section of Great Britain called Northern Ireland.

51
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,460
Although, despite the name, the northernmost part of the island of Ireland is not in Northern

52
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Ireland.

53
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,820
It's Malinhead, part of the Republic of Ireland.

54
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,860
Now to finish it off, we'll head up to Norway.

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,780
Norway's land stretches over Sweden and Finland to actually share a border with Russia.

56
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,740
On the other side of Eurasia, Russia also shares a tiny 11-mile border with North Korea.

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,900
This means that only one country separates the Nordic social democracy in Norway from

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,420
the communist dictatorship of North Korea.

59
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:44,260
Let's say there's a trolley and some tracks.

60
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,300
On those tracks are five men.

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,860
Charlie's barreling down those tracks, meaning with absolute certainty that it will hit those

62
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
five men.

63
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,180
Although, there is a sidetrack with one man on it.
