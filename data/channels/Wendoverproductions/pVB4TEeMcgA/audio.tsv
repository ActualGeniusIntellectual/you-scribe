0	9320	The 8.9 mile gap between the European and African continent known as the Strait of Gibraltar
9320	12680	is home to multiple strange territories and borders.
12680	17900	On the European side, there's a 2.6 square mile British overseas territory named Gibraltar.
17900	21600	This means that Britain shares a small land border with Spain.
21600	25640	On the African side of the Strait is the Spanish city of Ceuta, separated completely from the
25640	26640	rest of Spain.
27040	31200	This city is an autonomous community within Spain essentially having similar rights as
31200	33800	the independent regions that make up Spain.
33800	38200	A little more than 100 miles down the African coast is Mejia, another Spanish exclave in
38200	39720	Northern Africa.
39720	44480	All this means that Spain shares significant land borders with Morocco and that in effect
44480	48300	only one country separates British soil from African soil.
48300	51560	Two other European countries also have strange border relations.
51560	55000	Conventional wisdom would say that the Netherlands and France do not share land border.
55000	58720	Belgium stands between the two countries, however, on the other side of the world, the
58720	60640	two countries do share a border.
60640	65080	The Caribbean island of Saint Martin is split between a French collectivity, Saint Martin,
65080	69680	and a Dutch constituent colony, Saint Martin, meaning that you can walk from France to the
69680	72800	Netherlands without crossing through another country.
72800	74920	Also part of France is French Guiana.
74920	79520	French Guiana has the exact same political power as any other French department and region
79520	81960	despite being on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.
82520	87200	It has a comparable relationship as Hawaii to the United States, geographically separated
87200	89000	but politically integrated.
89000	93440	This means that France shares a land border with both Brazil and Suriname.
93440	97180	There are two daily flights from French Guiana to Paris which make for one of the longest
97180	99120	domestic flights in the world.
99120	105000	These flights take off in France and land in France but take 9 hours and cross 4,401
105000	106200	miles.
106200	109580	Despite this, this is not the longest domestic flight in the world.
109580	113980	The longest is also within France and goes from Paris to the French overseas department
113980	116740	of RÃ©union, located in the Indian Ocean.
116740	121900	The flight is 5,809 miles long and takes just over 11 hours.
121900	126180	And over to North America, it's impossible to walk or drive from New York to LA without
126180	127740	crossing over water.
127740	131740	The Saint Lawrence River connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, then the Chicago
131740	136020	River connects to the DePlains River, which connects to the Illinois River, which connects
136020	140100	to the Mississippi River, which flows out into the Gulf of Mexico.
140100	144740	It's also impossible to go from the south to the north of the US without crossing water.
144740	149000	There's one creek in the Teton Wilderness of Wyoming that divides at a place called
149000	150780	the Parting of the Waters.
150780	158980	One side flows 3,488 miles to the Atlantic while the other 1,353 miles to the Pacific.
158980	164300	This means that this is one of the few natural waterways connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.
164300	168700	Near those Great Lakes that make up part of the water split is Middle Island in Canada,
168700	171100	the southernmost point in Canada.
171100	177440	A majority of US states, 27, actually lie fully or partially north of this point.
177440	183420	The closest point in Europe to the US is the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland, only 2,539 miles
183420	185080	away from Hamel, Maine.
185080	188880	The island of Ireland is politically divided between the autonomous country of the Republic
188880	192420	of Ireland and the section of Great Britain called Northern Ireland.
192420	196460	Although, despite the name, the northernmost part of the island of Ireland is not in Northern
196460	197460	Ireland.
197460	199820	It's Malinhead, part of the Republic of Ireland.
199820	202860	Now to finish it off, we'll head up to Norway.
202860	207780	Norway's land stretches over Sweden and Finland to actually share a border with Russia.
207780	212740	On the other side of Eurasia, Russia also shares a tiny 11-mile border with North Korea.
212740	216900	This means that only one country separates the Nordic social democracy in Norway from
216900	219420	the communist dictatorship of North Korea.
219420	224260	Let's say there's a trolley and some tracks.
224260	226300	On those tracks are five men.
226300	230860	Charlie's barreling down those tracks, meaning with absolute certainty that it will hit those
230860	231860	five men.
231860	234180	Although, there is a sidetrack with one man on it.
