00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
The 8.9 mile gap between the European and African continent known as the Strait of Gibraltar

00:09.320 --> 00:12.680
is home to multiple strange territories and borders.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.900
On the European side, there's a 2.6 square mile British overseas territory named Gibraltar.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.600
This means that Britain shares a small land border with Spain.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.640
On the African side of the Strait is the Spanish city of Ceuta, separated completely from the

00:25.640 --> 00:26.640
rest of Spain.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.200
This city is an autonomous community within Spain essentially having similar rights as

00:31.200 --> 00:33.800
the independent regions that make up Spain.

00:33.800 --> 00:38.200
A little more than 100 miles down the African coast is Mejia, another Spanish exclave in

00:38.200 --> 00:39.720
Northern Africa.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.480
All this means that Spain shares significant land borders with Morocco and that in effect

00:44.480 --> 00:48.300
only one country separates British soil from African soil.

00:48.300 --> 00:51.560
Two other European countries also have strange border relations.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.000
Conventional wisdom would say that the Netherlands and France do not share land border.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.720
Belgium stands between the two countries, however, on the other side of the world, the

00:58.720 --> 01:00.640
two countries do share a border.

01:00.640 --> 01:05.080
The Caribbean island of Saint Martin is split between a French collectivity, Saint Martin,

01:05.080 --> 01:09.680
and a Dutch constituent colony, Saint Martin, meaning that you can walk from France to the

01:09.680 --> 01:12.800
Netherlands without crossing through another country.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.920
Also part of France is French Guiana.

01:14.920 --> 01:19.520
French Guiana has the exact same political power as any other French department and region

01:19.520 --> 01:21.960
despite being on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.

01:22.520 --> 01:27.200
It has a comparable relationship as Hawaii to the United States, geographically separated

01:27.200 --> 01:29.000
but politically integrated.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.440
This means that France shares a land border with both Brazil and Suriname.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.180
There are two daily flights from French Guiana to Paris which make for one of the longest

01:37.180 --> 01:39.120
domestic flights in the world.

01:39.120 --> 01:45.000
These flights take off in France and land in France but take 9 hours and cross 4,401

01:45.000 --> 01:46.200
miles.

01:46.200 --> 01:49.580
Despite this, this is not the longest domestic flight in the world.

01:49.580 --> 01:53.980
The longest is also within France and goes from Paris to the French overseas department

01:53.980 --> 01:56.740
of RÃ©union, located in the Indian Ocean.

01:56.740 --> 02:01.900
The flight is 5,809 miles long and takes just over 11 hours.

02:01.900 --> 02:06.180
And over to North America, it's impossible to walk or drive from New York to LA without

02:06.180 --> 02:07.740
crossing over water.

02:07.740 --> 02:11.740
The Saint Lawrence River connects the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, then the Chicago

02:11.740 --> 02:16.020
River connects to the DePlains River, which connects to the Illinois River, which connects

02:16.020 --> 02:20.100
to the Mississippi River, which flows out into the Gulf of Mexico.

02:20.100 --> 02:24.740
It's also impossible to go from the south to the north of the US without crossing water.

02:24.740 --> 02:29.000
There's one creek in the Teton Wilderness of Wyoming that divides at a place called

02:29.000 --> 02:30.780
the Parting of the Waters.

02:30.780 --> 02:38.980
One side flows 3,488 miles to the Atlantic while the other 1,353 miles to the Pacific.

02:38.980 --> 02:44.300
This means that this is one of the few natural waterways connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific.

02:44.300 --> 02:48.700
Near those Great Lakes that make up part of the water split is Middle Island in Canada,

02:48.700 --> 02:51.100
the southernmost point in Canada.

02:51.100 --> 02:57.440
A majority of US states, 27, actually lie fully or partially north of this point.

02:57.440 --> 03:03.420
The closest point in Europe to the US is the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland, only 2,539 miles

03:03.420 --> 03:05.080
away from Hamel, Maine.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.880
The island of Ireland is politically divided between the autonomous country of the Republic

03:08.880 --> 03:12.420
of Ireland and the section of Great Britain called Northern Ireland.

03:12.420 --> 03:16.460
Although, despite the name, the northernmost part of the island of Ireland is not in Northern

03:16.460 --> 03:17.460
Ireland.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.820
It's Malinhead, part of the Republic of Ireland.

03:19.820 --> 03:22.860
Now to finish it off, we'll head up to Norway.

03:22.860 --> 03:27.780
Norway's land stretches over Sweden and Finland to actually share a border with Russia.

03:27.780 --> 03:32.740
On the other side of Eurasia, Russia also shares a tiny 11-mile border with North Korea.

03:32.740 --> 03:36.900
This means that only one country separates the Nordic social democracy in Norway from

03:36.900 --> 03:39.420
the communist dictatorship of North Korea.

03:39.420 --> 03:44.260
Let's say there's a trolley and some tracks.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.300
On those tracks are five men.

03:46.300 --> 03:50.860
Charlie's barreling down those tracks, meaning with absolute certainty that it will hit those

03:50.860 --> 03:51.860
five men.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.180
Although, there is a sidetrack with one man on it.
