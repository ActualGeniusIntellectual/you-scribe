3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,900
This is Heathrow Airport—Britain's busiest.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,080
Each day, about 650 flights take off from one of its two runways.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,780
At the busiest times, this represents one aircraft every 45 seconds.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:26,800
Of those 650, about 20 flights daily head to Frankfurt.

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,520
During British Airways and Lufthansa, flights on this route depart more than hourly throughout

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,600
the daytime.

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,080
This makes Frankfurt one of Heathrow's most frequently served destinations.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,280
Despite the unremarkable nature of such a flight, the complexity of even this one hour

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,000
hop is enormous.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,760
It takes dozens of people spread out all across the continent to coordinate and navigate just

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,000
one of these flights safely to its destination.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,300
This is everything that happens within the 90 minutes it takes for a plane to get from

15
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,020
its gate at Heathrow to its gate in Frankfurt.

16
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,760
Hours before the flight is scheduled to take off, British Airways will have sent a flight

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,220
plan to HERE—Eurocontrol's Network Manager Operation Center in Brussels.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,900
Now, Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental air traffic management organization.

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:20,160
Well Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental organization of 43 states—Eurocontrol and beyond—and

20
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,260
we do air traffic management service transversal.

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,220
What that means is that Eurocontrol deals with a variety of different aspects of the

22
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,180
job of managing air traffic in Europe.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,400
One element of that is what's called network management.

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,380
This function essentially involves, from this room, making sure that flights make their

25
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,180
way through Europe as safely and smoothly as possible.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,060
That field is headed up by Sopo Prisinati—Eurocontrol's Director of Network Management.

27
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,500
So, here you see that's our operational room.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:57,940
The scope is to provide services to 43 air navigation service providers, to provide services

29
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,940
to more than 500 airports, and to provide services to more than 1,000 airlines over

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,180
the network.

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,260
One corner of this room is devoted to checking those flight plans that airlines send in.

32
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,080
Now, what they need to check is that these plans are following the rules.

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,160
You see, two aircraft, the sky does not look like this, but rather this.

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,640
At least in most of Europe, there are thousands upon thousands of predefined airways each

35
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,640
with their own rules on directionality and routes and more so aircraft not only need

36
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,520
to fly on these roads but they also need to follow the rules of the roads.

37
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,240
Looking at this map, you can see why, for example, you won't see many planes flying

38
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,880
over this area in the east of England—there just aren't many airways there.

39
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,560
Eurocontrol sends the flight plans through a program to check that they follow these

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
rules but if the computer rejects it, then it goes to these people in about 2% of cases

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,880
who coordinate with the airline to fix it manually.

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,440
From there, they'll distribute the flight plans to all the air traffic control centers

43
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,720
that each aircraft is expected to fly over.

44
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,320
That process happens before the flight has even taken off.

45
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,640
Going back to that British Airways Heathrow to Frankfurt flight, once their plan is approved,

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,460
the plane is fueled, loaded, and ready to go, the pilot will get approval from British

47
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,320
Airways' flight dispatcher, and Heathrow's ground control to push back.

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Ground control is responsible for navigating all the vehicles and planes safely across

49
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,340
the apron until when they reach the runway.

50
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,440
The moment an aircraft gets to the runway, they are then the responsibility of tower

51
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,700
control which, assuming all is well, clears them for takeoff.

52
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,440
As the plane reaches altitude, it will be passed off to the London Terminal Control

53
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,360
Center located here near Southampton which navigates aircraft through the complex London

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,040
area airspace until they reach 24,500 feet or flight level 245 which for this flight

55
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,240
should be just about when it reaches the coast.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,000
From there, they'll be transferred to the London Area Control Center, which is physically

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,640
located in the same building, to navigate them across the channel.

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,200
Once they reach about halfway across, however, they leave the UK's airspace and enter Belgium's.

59
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,860
With that, they are now the responsibility of the Maastricht Upper Area Control Center,

60
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,080
also managed by Eurocontrol.

61
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:20,480
We are a European nonprofit cross-border military-civil air navigation service provider and our job

62
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:27,020
is that we handle safely and in an efficient and performant way all traffic above flight

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,920
level 245, 24,500 feet.

64
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:38,200
To reiterate, they handle traffic across this whole area, above 24,500 feet or 7,500 meters.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:49,200
So we manage what more or less 1.9 million of movements per year so between 5,000-5,700

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,360
movements depending on the season and the day per day.

67
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,840
It's one of the busiest and most complex airspaces in Europe especially as it receives

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,200
a significant amount of traffic climbing from or descending into four of Europe's

69
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:07,180
five busiest airports—Heathrow, Schiphol, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.

70
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,040
Every single one of those flights, as long as it's between flight level 245 and 660,

71
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,560
is in contact with the people in this room.

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,880
Now, the Maastricht Control Center's airspace is divided into three sector groups—the

73
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,920
Brussels, Hanover, and Deco sector groups.

74
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,240
Each sector group is staffed by their own set of controllers who only work on their

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
group.

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,800
A Brussels sector group controller would very rarely switch over to the Hanover group, for

77
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
example.

78
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,820
Many controllers spend their entire careers working at one control center within one sector

79
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,840
group.

80
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,720
This allows them to really learn the design of their airspace in depth.

81
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Each of these sector groups is then divided into sectors themselves.

82
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,600
Now, sectors can be divided both horizontally and vertically.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,840
For example, there's the Luxembourg sector, between flight level 245 and 355, and also

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,060
the Luxembourg High sector, above flight level 355.

85
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,680
At the very busiest times, each sector will have its own dedicated set of controllers.

86
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,800
At less busy times, though, they can and do combine the upper and lower sectors together

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,600
so they're staffed by one set of controllers.

88
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,440
At the least busy times, such as in the middle of night, they'll often combine a number

89
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,540
of sectors.

90
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,180
For example, the entirety of Belgian airspace is typically controlled by one set of controllers

91
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,600
in the dead of night.

92
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,300
In charge of each sector are two controllers working as a team.

93
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,020
One is in charge of talking to pilots, the other is in charge of talking to their counterparts

94
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,260
at other sectors to coordinate handovers.

95
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,280
Now, in practice, for that London to Frankfurt flight, before it enters Maastricht airspace

96
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,660
in the Coxie sector, they'll receive info on where and at which flight level it will

97
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
arrive.

98
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,180
They'll also get info from the flight plan on where it's supposed to exit their sector.

99
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,780
An aircraft might also enter at one altitude and be planned to exit at another.

100
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,540
The task is then to safely navigate the aircraft from the entry point to exit point and deliver

101
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,100
it to the next sector at the desired altitude.

102
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,220
Now, assuming no added obstruction such as weather or airspace closures, the main obstacles

103
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,100
planes need to avoid at this altitude are other planes.

104
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,220
There are rules about how close a plane can be to another in order to avoid any chance

105
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,280
of mid-air collision and the controller's job is to make sure that these rules are not

106
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,640
broken or, if they are, to get to the correct level of separation as soon as possible.

107
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,180
An aircraft must be either vertically or horizontally separated from all others at any given time.

108
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,140
What this means is that typically, a commercial aircraft cruising at this altitude can be

109
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,180
as little as 1,000 vertical feet or 300 vertical meters away from another.

110
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,220
That's vertical separation.

111
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,740
Alternatively, an aircraft can be horizontally separated.

112
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,740
They have to be at least five nautical miles, six miles, or nine kilometers apart if they're

113
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,780
within 1,000 feet vertically.

114
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,660
Now, in order to achieve the goals of getting the aircraft to its exit point without breaking

115
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,860
minimum separation, there are three factors that the controller can instruct the pilot

116
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,660
to change—speed, altitude, and direction.

117
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,860
That is essentially what a controller spends most of their time doing—determining where

118
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,860
the aircraft needs to go, how to get it there, and communicating that to the pilot.

119
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,340
Soon enough, after just a few minutes, as the aircraft reaches its exit point from the

120
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,840
sector, it will be passed onto the controller of the next sector.

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,380
In this case, it'll go into Nikki sector, then Olno sector, then it will move onto airspace

122
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,760
beyond what the Maastricht upper area control center manages.

123
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,260
As the plane starts to descend, it will be passed onto controllers dealing with lower

124
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,540
airspace, then approach in tower control to guide it into landing.

125
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:41,020
All told, on just this hour-long flight, more than a dozen air traffic controllers will

126
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,140
have dealt with this aircraft.

127
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,000
But that's what happens when absolutely everything is going right, which is rarely

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
the case.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,700
You see, back at Eurocontrol's network manager room, the second thing they do with the flight

130
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,340
plans they receive is to make sure that once an aircraft gets flying, there are actually

131
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,900
enough air traffic controllers to manage it.

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,140
So air traffic controllers, they decide on their capacity, i.e. how many flights can

133
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,700
safely be handed in one piece of airspace by one air traffic controller.

134
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:17,660
That's their decision based on their staffing, based on their infrastructure, their tools,

135
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,700
and that is communicated to us.

136
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,540
So there's a limited number of flights a single air traffic controller can handle,

137
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,780
but there's also a limited number of air traffic controllers.

138
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,900
It's no secret that Europe, along with much of the world, is suffering through an air

139
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,580
traffic controller shortage right now.

140
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,780
Simultaneously, along with much of the world, Europe has been experiencing a tremendous

141
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,540
increase in its number of flights.

142
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,580
This supply and demand mismatch has consequences.

143
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:49,220
In 2018, 60% of all in-route delays, as in while the aircraft is actually flying, were

144
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,960
because of not having enough air traffic control capacity.

145
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,380
Part of Eurocontrol's job, therefore, is to utilize the limited resources in the most

146
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,140
effective way possible.

147
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,900
Often, they'll reduce overall delays by delaying flights.

148
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,620
Sometimes it's just for a few minutes, sometimes it's for longer, but if you're flying

149
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,900
in Europe and you hear that your flight is delayed for air traffic control reasons, that

150
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,580
decision was probably made in this room.

151
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,260
It's just like a ramp meter on a highway—they let a manageable number of flights fly at

152
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,060
any given time when there are capacity constraints.

153
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:28,300
Now, when a flight receives a delay by Eurocontrol, the airline essentially has two choices—accept

154
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,020
the delay and wait it out or fly a different route.

155
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,300
Airlines have access to Eurocontrol's system to help them make this decision.

156
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,780
For instance, here's a flight—it's a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester going to

157
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:46,180
Antalya in Turkey—and they have planned this blue route here.

158
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,920
This is the route that Thomas Cook has decided is best for them—it's the least expensive

159
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,740
considering fuel costs, overflight costs, and everything.

160
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,840
Given that it flies through capacity constrained areas, though, to fly this route, they would

161
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,980
have to sit through a delay.

162
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,180
Through our system now they can look at to see, okay, where are routes that do not give

163
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
them delay?

164
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,580
Those are all the blue routes you can see here.

165
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,560
And actually then there's a gray route here which is the shortest of the blue.

166
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,480
So system says if you want to avoid your route which has delay, you can take blue routes

167
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,000
or the shortest blue which is the gray and it's up to you.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,980
The airline can then go and decide whether it's worth it to them to fly the alternate

169
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,420
route or wait out the delay.

170
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,820
Europe's network management role is really most applicable on the worst days for flying

171
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,820
in Europe.

172
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,620
Their job is to make the bad days as okay as possible.

173
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,860
An example of a really bad day for flying was Thursday, May 9th, 2019.

174
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,780
The main issue was a large-scale French air traffic controller strike meaning there was

175
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,500
little air traffic control capacity in French airspace—one of the busiest areas.

176
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:58,340
If you look at this map, that shows the magnitude of the impact on the sectors that the color

177
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:04,360
red means that there were delays in the order of 45 minutes or above per flight.

178
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,220
On days such as this, many airlines will choose to fly around France as to be less delayed

179
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:14,780
but, of course, the ATC centers in the surrounding countries need to be able to cope with demand.

180
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,740
Starting from three to four days before this event is confirmed, we would coordinate with

181
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,860
Spain, North African countries, Algeria, Tunisia, we would coordinate with Switzerland, Italy,

182
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Germany, Calgary, we would coordinate with Maastricht and UK to be able to get extra

183
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,620
capacity for all those who have to go out.

184
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:50,780
So, one alternative route from UK to go down to south of Spain and a continuation on that,

185
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,660
what we call tango.

186
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,740
Tango route takes planes way out west into oceanic airspace to take a wide curve around

187
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,820
French airspace and is commonly flown when French airspace is restricted.

188
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,260
It is, of course, not efficient.

189
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,540
A flight from Alicante to London, for example, which normally takes just two hours, would

190
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,980
take over three by using tango route but, overall, it would typically arrive earlier

191
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,700
than if they waited for approval to fly through French airspace.

192
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,460
What made the 9th of May even worse is that drones were spotted at Frankfurt airport meaning

193
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,260
all arrivals and departures were stopped.

194
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:32,260
What we do, we immediately get in contact with all the airports around, if you like.

195
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:51,580
Eurocontrol will get information from the surrounding airports on how many diverted

196
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,380
aircraft they can handle and passes this information on airlines so they can quickly book a diversion

197
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,540
slot for their aircraft.

198
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:04,460
All told, there were over 300,000 minutes of delays on May 9th but initial calculations

199
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:08,620
determined that there was the potential for over 1 million minutes of delays which means

200
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,220
that Eurocontrol likely succeeded in their task of improving the day.

201
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,540
Eurocontrol's network manager room is expected to be quite busy in the coming months.

202
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,380
Right now, in early June, they already know summer 2019 is going to be messy.

203
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,380
It's the busiest period of the year for flights and there's actually less air traffic

204
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,780
control capacity than there was in summer 2018 when they had 26 million minutes of delays.

205
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,400
They fear this summer could be worse but, they made their action plan months ago and

206
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,680
will be here non-stop through the coming months to make the summer travel season as smooth

207
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,980
as it can be.

208
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,280
Overall, this room, air traffic control centers, and the rest of the world's air traffic

209
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,340
management infrastructure are crucial tools to make sure that routine, uneventful flights

210
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,680
like London to Frankfurt stay uneventful.

211
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,400
One thing that aviation loves is checklists.

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,300
They make sure you complete crucial steps and that's why, when I launch something

213
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,780
new, I have my own checklist of crucial steps.

214
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,700
One of the first steps, after coming up with a name, is buying the domain name.

215
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,680
That's because I know that domains go fast and, if you wait too long, someone else might

216
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,260
take your perfect domain.

217
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,320
I recently launched a podcast, for example, and immediately bought the domain extremitiespodcast.com

218
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
through Hover.

219
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,720
I haven't even set up a website yet but, considering the low price, it was worth it

220
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,380
to me to sit on the domain and, for now, I took about 30 seconds to set up the domain

221
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,100
to redirect to the podcast download page.

222
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,280
No matter what you're doing, whether it be a YouTube channel, a podcast, a business,

223
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,900
or anything else, you should get your domain now before it's gone and Hover makes that

224
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,800
absurdly simple.

225
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,320
First of all, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you will get 10% off your first

226
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:50,880
domain.
