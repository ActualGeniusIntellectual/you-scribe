00:08.640 --> 00:11.900
This is Heathrow Airport—Britain's busiest.

00:11.900 --> 00:17.080
Each day, about 650 flights take off from one of its two runways.

00:17.080 --> 00:21.780
At the busiest times, this represents one aircraft every 45 seconds.

00:21.780 --> 00:26.800
Of those 650, about 20 flights daily head to Frankfurt.

00:26.800 --> 00:31.520
During British Airways and Lufthansa, flights on this route depart more than hourly throughout

00:31.520 --> 00:32.600
the daytime.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.080
This makes Frankfurt one of Heathrow's most frequently served destinations.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.280
Despite the unremarkable nature of such a flight, the complexity of even this one hour

00:41.280 --> 00:43.000
hop is enormous.

00:43.000 --> 00:47.760
It takes dozens of people spread out all across the continent to coordinate and navigate just

00:47.760 --> 00:51.000
one of these flights safely to its destination.

00:51.000 --> 00:55.300
This is everything that happens within the 90 minutes it takes for a plane to get from

00:55.300 --> 00:59.020
its gate at Heathrow to its gate in Frankfurt.

00:59.020 --> 01:02.760
Hours before the flight is scheduled to take off, British Airways will have sent a flight

01:02.760 --> 01:08.220
plan to HERE—Eurocontrol's Network Manager Operation Center in Brussels.

01:08.220 --> 01:12.900
Now, Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental air traffic management organization.

01:12.900 --> 01:20.160
Well Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental organization of 43 states—Eurocontrol and beyond—and

01:20.160 --> 01:23.260
we do air traffic management service transversal.

01:23.260 --> 01:27.220
What that means is that Eurocontrol deals with a variety of different aspects of the

01:27.220 --> 01:30.180
job of managing air traffic in Europe.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.400
One element of that is what's called network management.

01:33.400 --> 01:37.380
This function essentially involves, from this room, making sure that flights make their

01:37.380 --> 01:41.180
way through Europe as safely and smoothly as possible.

01:41.180 --> 01:46.060
That field is headed up by Sopo Prisinati—Eurocontrol's Director of Network Management.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.500
So, here you see that's our operational room.

01:49.500 --> 01:57.940
The scope is to provide services to 43 air navigation service providers, to provide services

01:57.940 --> 02:04.940
to more than 500 airports, and to provide services to more than 1,000 airlines over

02:04.940 --> 02:06.180
the network.

02:06.180 --> 02:10.260
One corner of this room is devoted to checking those flight plans that airlines send in.

02:10.260 --> 02:15.080
Now, what they need to check is that these plans are following the rules.

02:15.080 --> 02:20.160
You see, two aircraft, the sky does not look like this, but rather this.

02:20.160 --> 02:24.640
At least in most of Europe, there are thousands upon thousands of predefined airways each

02:24.640 --> 02:29.640
with their own rules on directionality and routes and more so aircraft not only need

02:29.640 --> 02:34.520
to fly on these roads but they also need to follow the rules of the roads.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.240
Looking at this map, you can see why, for example, you won't see many planes flying

02:38.240 --> 02:42.880
over this area in the east of England—there just aren't many airways there.

02:42.880 --> 02:46.560
Eurocontrol sends the flight plans through a program to check that they follow these

02:46.560 --> 02:51.840
rules but if the computer rejects it, then it goes to these people in about 2% of cases

02:51.840 --> 02:54.880
who coordinate with the airline to fix it manually.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.440
From there, they'll distribute the flight plans to all the air traffic control centers

02:58.440 --> 03:01.720
that each aircraft is expected to fly over.

03:01.720 --> 03:05.320
That process happens before the flight has even taken off.

03:05.320 --> 03:09.640
Going back to that British Airways Heathrow to Frankfurt flight, once their plan is approved,

03:09.640 --> 03:13.460
the plane is fueled, loaded, and ready to go, the pilot will get approval from British

03:13.460 --> 03:18.320
Airways' flight dispatcher, and Heathrow's ground control to push back.

03:18.320 --> 03:22.320
Ground control is responsible for navigating all the vehicles and planes safely across

03:22.320 --> 03:25.340
the apron until when they reach the runway.

03:25.340 --> 03:29.440
The moment an aircraft gets to the runway, they are then the responsibility of tower

03:29.440 --> 03:33.700
control which, assuming all is well, clears them for takeoff.

03:33.700 --> 03:37.440
As the plane reaches altitude, it will be passed off to the London Terminal Control

03:37.440 --> 03:42.360
Center located here near Southampton which navigates aircraft through the complex London

03:42.360 --> 03:48.040
area airspace until they reach 24,500 feet or flight level 245 which for this flight

03:48.040 --> 03:51.240
should be just about when it reaches the coast.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.000
From there, they'll be transferred to the London Area Control Center, which is physically

03:55.000 --> 03:58.640
located in the same building, to navigate them across the channel.

03:58.640 --> 04:04.200
Once they reach about halfway across, however, they leave the UK's airspace and enter Belgium's.

04:04.200 --> 04:08.860
With that, they are now the responsibility of the Maastricht Upper Area Control Center,

04:08.860 --> 04:11.080
also managed by Eurocontrol.

04:11.080 --> 04:20.480
We are a European nonprofit cross-border military-civil air navigation service provider and our job

04:20.480 --> 04:27.020
is that we handle safely and in an efficient and performant way all traffic above flight

04:27.020 --> 04:30.920
level 245, 24,500 feet.

04:30.920 --> 04:38.200
To reiterate, they handle traffic across this whole area, above 24,500 feet or 7,500 meters.

04:38.200 --> 04:49.200
So we manage what more or less 1.9 million of movements per year so between 5,000-5,700

04:49.200 --> 04:53.360
movements depending on the season and the day per day.

04:53.360 --> 04:57.840
It's one of the busiest and most complex airspaces in Europe especially as it receives

04:57.840 --> 05:02.200
a significant amount of traffic climbing from or descending into four of Europe's

05:02.200 --> 05:07.180
five busiest airports—Heathrow, Schiphol, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.

05:07.180 --> 05:12.040
Every single one of those flights, as long as it's between flight level 245 and 660,

05:12.040 --> 05:14.560
is in contact with the people in this room.

05:14.560 --> 05:19.880
Now, the Maastricht Control Center's airspace is divided into three sector groups—the

05:19.880 --> 05:22.920
Brussels, Hanover, and Deco sector groups.

05:22.920 --> 05:27.240
Each sector group is staffed by their own set of controllers who only work on their

05:27.240 --> 05:28.240
group.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.800
A Brussels sector group controller would very rarely switch over to the Hanover group, for

05:31.800 --> 05:32.800
example.

05:32.800 --> 05:37.820
Many controllers spend their entire careers working at one control center within one sector

05:37.820 --> 05:38.840
group.

05:38.840 --> 05:42.720
This allows them to really learn the design of their airspace in depth.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.320
Each of these sector groups is then divided into sectors themselves.

05:46.320 --> 05:50.600
Now, sectors can be divided both horizontally and vertically.

05:50.600 --> 05:55.840
For example, there's the Luxembourg sector, between flight level 245 and 355, and also

05:55.840 --> 06:00.060
the Luxembourg High sector, above flight level 355.

06:00.060 --> 06:05.680
At the very busiest times, each sector will have its own dedicated set of controllers.

06:05.680 --> 06:10.800
At less busy times, though, they can and do combine the upper and lower sectors together

06:10.800 --> 06:13.600
so they're staffed by one set of controllers.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.440
At the least busy times, such as in the middle of night, they'll often combine a number

06:17.440 --> 06:18.540
of sectors.

06:18.540 --> 06:23.180
For example, the entirety of Belgian airspace is typically controlled by one set of controllers

06:23.180 --> 06:24.600
in the dead of night.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.300
In charge of each sector are two controllers working as a team.

06:28.300 --> 06:32.020
One is in charge of talking to pilots, the other is in charge of talking to their counterparts

06:32.020 --> 06:34.260
at other sectors to coordinate handovers.

06:34.260 --> 06:39.280
Now, in practice, for that London to Frankfurt flight, before it enters Maastricht airspace

06:39.280 --> 06:43.660
in the Coxie sector, they'll receive info on where and at which flight level it will

06:43.660 --> 06:44.660
arrive.

06:44.660 --> 06:49.180
They'll also get info from the flight plan on where it's supposed to exit their sector.

06:49.180 --> 06:53.780
An aircraft might also enter at one altitude and be planned to exit at another.

06:53.780 --> 06:58.540
The task is then to safely navigate the aircraft from the entry point to exit point and deliver

06:58.540 --> 07:01.100
it to the next sector at the desired altitude.

07:01.100 --> 07:06.220
Now, assuming no added obstruction such as weather or airspace closures, the main obstacles

07:06.220 --> 07:10.100
planes need to avoid at this altitude are other planes.

07:10.100 --> 07:14.220
There are rules about how close a plane can be to another in order to avoid any chance

07:14.220 --> 07:18.280
of mid-air collision and the controller's job is to make sure that these rules are not

07:18.280 --> 07:23.640
broken or, if they are, to get to the correct level of separation as soon as possible.

07:23.640 --> 07:29.180
An aircraft must be either vertically or horizontally separated from all others at any given time.

07:29.180 --> 07:33.140
What this means is that typically, a commercial aircraft cruising at this altitude can be

07:33.140 --> 07:38.180
as little as 1,000 vertical feet or 300 vertical meters away from another.

07:38.180 --> 07:40.220
That's vertical separation.

07:40.220 --> 07:43.740
Alternatively, an aircraft can be horizontally separated.

07:43.740 --> 07:48.740
They have to be at least five nautical miles, six miles, or nine kilometers apart if they're

07:48.740 --> 07:50.780
within 1,000 feet vertically.

07:50.780 --> 07:55.660
Now, in order to achieve the goals of getting the aircraft to its exit point without breaking

07:55.660 --> 07:59.860
minimum separation, there are three factors that the controller can instruct the pilot

07:59.860 --> 08:03.660
to change—speed, altitude, and direction.

08:03.660 --> 08:07.860
That is essentially what a controller spends most of their time doing—determining where

08:07.860 --> 08:12.860
the aircraft needs to go, how to get it there, and communicating that to the pilot.

08:12.860 --> 08:17.340
Soon enough, after just a few minutes, as the aircraft reaches its exit point from the

08:17.340 --> 08:20.840
sector, it will be passed onto the controller of the next sector.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.380
In this case, it'll go into Nikki sector, then Olno sector, then it will move onto airspace

08:25.380 --> 08:28.760
beyond what the Maastricht upper area control center manages.

08:28.760 --> 08:32.260
As the plane starts to descend, it will be passed onto controllers dealing with lower

08:32.260 --> 08:36.540
airspace, then approach in tower control to guide it into landing.

08:36.540 --> 08:41.020
All told, on just this hour-long flight, more than a dozen air traffic controllers will

08:41.020 --> 08:43.140
have dealt with this aircraft.

08:43.140 --> 08:47.000
But that's what happens when absolutely everything is going right, which is rarely

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
the case.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.700
You see, back at Eurocontrol's network manager room, the second thing they do with the flight

08:52.700 --> 08:57.340
plans they receive is to make sure that once an aircraft gets flying, there are actually

08:57.340 --> 08:59.900
enough air traffic controllers to manage it.

08:59.900 --> 09:05.140
So air traffic controllers, they decide on their capacity, i.e. how many flights can

09:05.140 --> 09:09.700
safely be handed in one piece of airspace by one air traffic controller.

09:09.700 --> 09:17.660
That's their decision based on their staffing, based on their infrastructure, their tools,

09:17.660 --> 09:19.700
and that is communicated to us.

09:19.700 --> 09:23.540
So there's a limited number of flights a single air traffic controller can handle,

09:23.540 --> 09:26.780
but there's also a limited number of air traffic controllers.

09:26.780 --> 09:30.900
It's no secret that Europe, along with much of the world, is suffering through an air

09:30.900 --> 09:33.580
traffic controller shortage right now.

09:33.580 --> 09:37.780
Simultaneously, along with much of the world, Europe has been experiencing a tremendous

09:37.780 --> 09:40.540
increase in its number of flights.

09:40.540 --> 09:43.580
This supply and demand mismatch has consequences.

09:43.580 --> 09:49.220
In 2018, 60% of all in-route delays, as in while the aircraft is actually flying, were

09:49.220 --> 09:52.960
because of not having enough air traffic control capacity.

09:52.960 --> 09:57.380
Part of Eurocontrol's job, therefore, is to utilize the limited resources in the most

09:57.380 --> 09:59.140
effective way possible.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.900
Often, they'll reduce overall delays by delaying flights.

10:03.900 --> 10:07.620
Sometimes it's just for a few minutes, sometimes it's for longer, but if you're flying

10:07.620 --> 10:11.900
in Europe and you hear that your flight is delayed for air traffic control reasons, that

10:11.900 --> 10:14.580
decision was probably made in this room.

10:14.580 --> 10:19.260
It's just like a ramp meter on a highway—they let a manageable number of flights fly at

10:19.260 --> 10:22.060
any given time when there are capacity constraints.

10:22.060 --> 10:28.300
Now, when a flight receives a delay by Eurocontrol, the airline essentially has two choices—accept

10:28.300 --> 10:32.020
the delay and wait it out or fly a different route.

10:32.020 --> 10:35.300
Airlines have access to Eurocontrol's system to help them make this decision.

10:35.860 --> 10:40.780
For instance, here's a flight—it's a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester going to

10:40.780 --> 10:46.180
Antalya in Turkey—and they have planned this blue route here.

10:46.180 --> 10:50.920
This is the route that Thomas Cook has decided is best for them—it's the least expensive

10:50.920 --> 10:54.740
considering fuel costs, overflight costs, and everything.

10:54.740 --> 10:58.840
Given that it flies through capacity constrained areas, though, to fly this route, they would

10:58.840 --> 11:00.980
have to sit through a delay.

11:00.980 --> 11:05.180
Through our system now they can look at to see, okay, where are routes that do not give

11:05.180 --> 11:06.180
them delay?

11:06.180 --> 11:08.580
Those are all the blue routes you can see here.

11:08.580 --> 11:12.560
And actually then there's a gray route here which is the shortest of the blue.

11:12.560 --> 11:17.480
So system says if you want to avoid your route which has delay, you can take blue routes

11:17.480 --> 11:21.000
or the shortest blue which is the gray and it's up to you.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.980
The airline can then go and decide whether it's worth it to them to fly the alternate

11:24.980 --> 11:27.420
route or wait out the delay.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.820
Europe's network management role is really most applicable on the worst days for flying

11:31.820 --> 11:32.820
in Europe.

11:32.820 --> 11:36.620
Their job is to make the bad days as okay as possible.

11:36.620 --> 11:41.860
An example of a really bad day for flying was Thursday, May 9th, 2019.

11:41.860 --> 11:45.780
The main issue was a large-scale French air traffic controller strike meaning there was

11:45.780 --> 11:50.500
little air traffic control capacity in French airspace—one of the busiest areas.

11:50.500 --> 11:58.340
If you look at this map, that shows the magnitude of the impact on the sectors that the color

11:58.340 --> 12:04.360
red means that there were delays in the order of 45 minutes or above per flight.

12:04.360 --> 12:09.220
On days such as this, many airlines will choose to fly around France as to be less delayed

12:09.220 --> 12:14.780
but, of course, the ATC centers in the surrounding countries need to be able to cope with demand.

12:14.780 --> 12:21.740
Starting from three to four days before this event is confirmed, we would coordinate with

12:21.740 --> 12:29.860
Spain, North African countries, Algeria, Tunisia, we would coordinate with Switzerland, Italy,

12:29.860 --> 12:37.860
Germany, Calgary, we would coordinate with Maastricht and UK to be able to get extra

12:37.860 --> 12:42.620
capacity for all those who have to go out.

12:42.620 --> 12:50.780
So, one alternative route from UK to go down to south of Spain and a continuation on that,

12:50.780 --> 12:52.660
what we call tango.

12:52.660 --> 12:57.740
Tango route takes planes way out west into oceanic airspace to take a wide curve around

12:57.740 --> 13:01.820
French airspace and is commonly flown when French airspace is restricted.

13:01.820 --> 13:04.260
It is, of course, not efficient.

13:04.260 --> 13:08.540
A flight from Alicante to London, for example, which normally takes just two hours, would

13:08.540 --> 13:12.980
take over three by using tango route but, overall, it would typically arrive earlier

13:12.980 --> 13:16.700
than if they waited for approval to fly through French airspace.

13:16.700 --> 13:21.460
What made the 9th of May even worse is that drones were spotted at Frankfurt airport meaning

13:21.460 --> 13:24.260
all arrivals and departures were stopped.

13:24.260 --> 13:32.260
What we do, we immediately get in contact with all the airports around, if you like.

13:32.260 --> 13:51.580
Eurocontrol will get information from the surrounding airports on how many diverted

13:51.580 --> 13:56.380
aircraft they can handle and passes this information on airlines so they can quickly book a diversion

13:56.380 --> 13:58.540
slot for their aircraft.

13:58.540 --> 14:04.460
All told, there were over 300,000 minutes of delays on May 9th but initial calculations

14:04.460 --> 14:08.620
determined that there was the potential for over 1 million minutes of delays which means

14:08.620 --> 14:13.220
that Eurocontrol likely succeeded in their task of improving the day.

14:13.220 --> 14:17.540
Eurocontrol's network manager room is expected to be quite busy in the coming months.

14:17.540 --> 14:22.380
Right now, in early June, they already know summer 2019 is going to be messy.

14:22.380 --> 14:26.380
It's the busiest period of the year for flights and there's actually less air traffic

14:26.380 --> 14:32.780
control capacity than there was in summer 2018 when they had 26 million minutes of delays.

14:32.780 --> 14:37.400
They fear this summer could be worse but, they made their action plan months ago and

14:37.400 --> 14:41.680
will be here non-stop through the coming months to make the summer travel season as smooth

14:41.680 --> 14:42.980
as it can be.

14:42.980 --> 14:47.280
Overall, this room, air traffic control centers, and the rest of the world's air traffic

14:47.280 --> 14:52.340
management infrastructure are crucial tools to make sure that routine, uneventful flights

14:52.340 --> 14:56.680
like London to Frankfurt stay uneventful.

14:56.680 --> 14:59.400
One thing that aviation loves is checklists.

14:59.400 --> 15:03.300
They make sure you complete crucial steps and that's why, when I launch something

15:03.300 --> 15:06.780
new, I have my own checklist of crucial steps.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.700
One of the first steps, after coming up with a name, is buying the domain name.

15:10.700 --> 15:15.680
That's because I know that domains go fast and, if you wait too long, someone else might

15:15.680 --> 15:17.260
take your perfect domain.

15:17.260 --> 15:22.320
I recently launched a podcast, for example, and immediately bought the domain extremitiespodcast.com

15:22.320 --> 15:23.320
through Hover.

15:23.320 --> 15:27.720
I haven't even set up a website yet but, considering the low price, it was worth it

15:27.720 --> 15:32.380
to me to sit on the domain and, for now, I took about 30 seconds to set up the domain

15:32.380 --> 15:35.100
to redirect to the podcast download page.

15:35.100 --> 15:39.280
No matter what you're doing, whether it be a YouTube channel, a podcast, a business,

15:39.280 --> 15:43.900
or anything else, you should get your domain now before it's gone and Hover makes that

15:43.900 --> 15:45.800
absurdly simple.

15:45.800 --> 15:50.320
First of all, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you will get 10% off your first

15:50.320 --> 15:50.880
domain.
