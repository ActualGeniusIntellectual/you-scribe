8640	11900	This is Heathrow Airport—Britain's busiest.
11900	17080	Each day, about 650 flights take off from one of its two runways.
17080	21780	At the busiest times, this represents one aircraft every 45 seconds.
21780	26800	Of those 650, about 20 flights daily head to Frankfurt.
26800	31520	During British Airways and Lufthansa, flights on this route depart more than hourly throughout
31520	32600	the daytime.
32600	37080	This makes Frankfurt one of Heathrow's most frequently served destinations.
37080	41280	Despite the unremarkable nature of such a flight, the complexity of even this one hour
41280	43000	hop is enormous.
43000	47760	It takes dozens of people spread out all across the continent to coordinate and navigate just
47760	51000	one of these flights safely to its destination.
51000	55300	This is everything that happens within the 90 minutes it takes for a plane to get from
55300	59020	its gate at Heathrow to its gate in Frankfurt.
59020	62760	Hours before the flight is scheduled to take off, British Airways will have sent a flight
62760	68220	plan to HERE—Eurocontrol's Network Manager Operation Center in Brussels.
68220	72900	Now, Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental air traffic management organization.
72900	80160	Well Eurocontrol is an intergovernmental organization of 43 states—Eurocontrol and beyond—and
80160	83260	we do air traffic management service transversal.
83260	87220	What that means is that Eurocontrol deals with a variety of different aspects of the
87220	90180	job of managing air traffic in Europe.
90180	93400	One element of that is what's called network management.
93400	97380	This function essentially involves, from this room, making sure that flights make their
97380	101180	way through Europe as safely and smoothly as possible.
101180	106060	That field is headed up by Sopo Prisinati—Eurocontrol's Director of Network Management.
106060	109500	So, here you see that's our operational room.
109500	117940	The scope is to provide services to 43 air navigation service providers, to provide services
117940	124940	to more than 500 airports, and to provide services to more than 1,000 airlines over
124940	126180	the network.
126180	130260	One corner of this room is devoted to checking those flight plans that airlines send in.
130260	135080	Now, what they need to check is that these plans are following the rules.
135080	140160	You see, two aircraft, the sky does not look like this, but rather this.
140160	144640	At least in most of Europe, there are thousands upon thousands of predefined airways each
144640	149640	with their own rules on directionality and routes and more so aircraft not only need
149640	154520	to fly on these roads but they also need to follow the rules of the roads.
154520	158240	Looking at this map, you can see why, for example, you won't see many planes flying
158240	162880	over this area in the east of England—there just aren't many airways there.
162880	166560	Eurocontrol sends the flight plans through a program to check that they follow these
166560	171840	rules but if the computer rejects it, then it goes to these people in about 2% of cases
171840	174880	who coordinate with the airline to fix it manually.
174880	178440	From there, they'll distribute the flight plans to all the air traffic control centers
178440	181720	that each aircraft is expected to fly over.
181720	185320	That process happens before the flight has even taken off.
185320	189640	Going back to that British Airways Heathrow to Frankfurt flight, once their plan is approved,
189640	193460	the plane is fueled, loaded, and ready to go, the pilot will get approval from British
193460	198320	Airways' flight dispatcher, and Heathrow's ground control to push back.
198320	202320	Ground control is responsible for navigating all the vehicles and planes safely across
202320	205340	the apron until when they reach the runway.
205340	209440	The moment an aircraft gets to the runway, they are then the responsibility of tower
209440	213700	control which, assuming all is well, clears them for takeoff.
213700	217440	As the plane reaches altitude, it will be passed off to the London Terminal Control
217440	222360	Center located here near Southampton which navigates aircraft through the complex London
222360	228040	area airspace until they reach 24,500 feet or flight level 245 which for this flight
228040	231240	should be just about when it reaches the coast.
231240	235000	From there, they'll be transferred to the London Area Control Center, which is physically
235000	238640	located in the same building, to navigate them across the channel.
238640	244200	Once they reach about halfway across, however, they leave the UK's airspace and enter Belgium's.
244200	248860	With that, they are now the responsibility of the Maastricht Upper Area Control Center,
248860	251080	also managed by Eurocontrol.
251080	260480	We are a European nonprofit cross-border military-civil air navigation service provider and our job
260480	267020	is that we handle safely and in an efficient and performant way all traffic above flight
267020	270920	level 245, 24,500 feet.
270920	278200	To reiterate, they handle traffic across this whole area, above 24,500 feet or 7,500 meters.
278200	289200	So we manage what more or less 1.9 million of movements per year so between 5,000-5,700
289200	293360	movements depending on the season and the day per day.
293360	297840	It's one of the busiest and most complex airspaces in Europe especially as it receives
297840	302200	a significant amount of traffic climbing from or descending into four of Europe's
302200	307180	five busiest airports—Heathrow, Schiphol, Frankfurt, and Paris Charles de Gaulle.
307180	312040	Every single one of those flights, as long as it's between flight level 245 and 660,
312040	314560	is in contact with the people in this room.
314560	319880	Now, the Maastricht Control Center's airspace is divided into three sector groups—the
319880	322920	Brussels, Hanover, and Deco sector groups.
322920	327240	Each sector group is staffed by their own set of controllers who only work on their
327240	328240	group.
328240	331800	A Brussels sector group controller would very rarely switch over to the Hanover group, for
331800	332800	example.
332800	337820	Many controllers spend their entire careers working at one control center within one sector
337820	338840	group.
338840	342720	This allows them to really learn the design of their airspace in depth.
342720	346320	Each of these sector groups is then divided into sectors themselves.
346320	350600	Now, sectors can be divided both horizontally and vertically.
350600	355840	For example, there's the Luxembourg sector, between flight level 245 and 355, and also
355840	360060	the Luxembourg High sector, above flight level 355.
360060	365680	At the very busiest times, each sector will have its own dedicated set of controllers.
365680	370800	At less busy times, though, they can and do combine the upper and lower sectors together
370800	373600	so they're staffed by one set of controllers.
373600	377440	At the least busy times, such as in the middle of night, they'll often combine a number
377440	378540	of sectors.
378540	383180	For example, the entirety of Belgian airspace is typically controlled by one set of controllers
383180	384600	in the dead of night.
384600	388300	In charge of each sector are two controllers working as a team.
388300	392020	One is in charge of talking to pilots, the other is in charge of talking to their counterparts
392020	394260	at other sectors to coordinate handovers.
394260	399280	Now, in practice, for that London to Frankfurt flight, before it enters Maastricht airspace
399280	403660	in the Coxie sector, they'll receive info on where and at which flight level it will
403660	404660	arrive.
404660	409180	They'll also get info from the flight plan on where it's supposed to exit their sector.
409180	413780	An aircraft might also enter at one altitude and be planned to exit at another.
413780	418540	The task is then to safely navigate the aircraft from the entry point to exit point and deliver
418540	421100	it to the next sector at the desired altitude.
421100	426220	Now, assuming no added obstruction such as weather or airspace closures, the main obstacles
426220	430100	planes need to avoid at this altitude are other planes.
430100	434220	There are rules about how close a plane can be to another in order to avoid any chance
434220	438280	of mid-air collision and the controller's job is to make sure that these rules are not
438280	443640	broken or, if they are, to get to the correct level of separation as soon as possible.
443640	449180	An aircraft must be either vertically or horizontally separated from all others at any given time.
449180	453140	What this means is that typically, a commercial aircraft cruising at this altitude can be
453140	458180	as little as 1,000 vertical feet or 300 vertical meters away from another.
458180	460220	That's vertical separation.
460220	463740	Alternatively, an aircraft can be horizontally separated.
463740	468740	They have to be at least five nautical miles, six miles, or nine kilometers apart if they're
468740	470780	within 1,000 feet vertically.
470780	475660	Now, in order to achieve the goals of getting the aircraft to its exit point without breaking
475660	479860	minimum separation, there are three factors that the controller can instruct the pilot
479860	483660	to change—speed, altitude, and direction.
483660	487860	That is essentially what a controller spends most of their time doing—determining where
487860	492860	the aircraft needs to go, how to get it there, and communicating that to the pilot.
492860	497340	Soon enough, after just a few minutes, as the aircraft reaches its exit point from the
497340	500840	sector, it will be passed onto the controller of the next sector.
500840	505380	In this case, it'll go into Nikki sector, then Olno sector, then it will move onto airspace
505380	508760	beyond what the Maastricht upper area control center manages.
508760	512260	As the plane starts to descend, it will be passed onto controllers dealing with lower
512260	516540	airspace, then approach in tower control to guide it into landing.
516540	521020	All told, on just this hour-long flight, more than a dozen air traffic controllers will
521020	523140	have dealt with this aircraft.
523140	527000	But that's what happens when absolutely everything is going right, which is rarely
527000	528000	the case.
528000	532700	You see, back at Eurocontrol's network manager room, the second thing they do with the flight
532700	537340	plans they receive is to make sure that once an aircraft gets flying, there are actually
537340	539900	enough air traffic controllers to manage it.
539900	545140	So air traffic controllers, they decide on their capacity, i.e. how many flights can
545140	549700	safely be handed in one piece of airspace by one air traffic controller.
549700	557660	That's their decision based on their staffing, based on their infrastructure, their tools,
557660	559700	and that is communicated to us.
559700	563540	So there's a limited number of flights a single air traffic controller can handle,
563540	566780	but there's also a limited number of air traffic controllers.
566780	570900	It's no secret that Europe, along with much of the world, is suffering through an air
570900	573580	traffic controller shortage right now.
573580	577780	Simultaneously, along with much of the world, Europe has been experiencing a tremendous
577780	580540	increase in its number of flights.
580540	583580	This supply and demand mismatch has consequences.
583580	589220	In 2018, 60% of all in-route delays, as in while the aircraft is actually flying, were
589220	592960	because of not having enough air traffic control capacity.
592960	597380	Part of Eurocontrol's job, therefore, is to utilize the limited resources in the most
597380	599140	effective way possible.
599140	603900	Often, they'll reduce overall delays by delaying flights.
603900	607620	Sometimes it's just for a few minutes, sometimes it's for longer, but if you're flying
607620	611900	in Europe and you hear that your flight is delayed for air traffic control reasons, that
611900	614580	decision was probably made in this room.
614580	619260	It's just like a ramp meter on a highway—they let a manageable number of flights fly at
619260	622060	any given time when there are capacity constraints.
622060	628300	Now, when a flight receives a delay by Eurocontrol, the airline essentially has two choices—accept
628300	632020	the delay and wait it out or fly a different route.
632020	635300	Airlines have access to Eurocontrol's system to help them make this decision.
635860	640780	For instance, here's a flight—it's a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester going to
640780	646180	Antalya in Turkey—and they have planned this blue route here.
646180	650920	This is the route that Thomas Cook has decided is best for them—it's the least expensive
650920	654740	considering fuel costs, overflight costs, and everything.
654740	658840	Given that it flies through capacity constrained areas, though, to fly this route, they would
658840	660980	have to sit through a delay.
660980	665180	Through our system now they can look at to see, okay, where are routes that do not give
665180	666180	them delay?
666180	668580	Those are all the blue routes you can see here.
668580	672560	And actually then there's a gray route here which is the shortest of the blue.
672560	677480	So system says if you want to avoid your route which has delay, you can take blue routes
677480	681000	or the shortest blue which is the gray and it's up to you.
681000	684980	The airline can then go and decide whether it's worth it to them to fly the alternate
684980	687420	route or wait out the delay.
687420	691820	Europe's network management role is really most applicable on the worst days for flying
691820	692820	in Europe.
692820	696620	Their job is to make the bad days as okay as possible.
696620	701860	An example of a really bad day for flying was Thursday, May 9th, 2019.
701860	705780	The main issue was a large-scale French air traffic controller strike meaning there was
705780	710500	little air traffic control capacity in French airspace—one of the busiest areas.
710500	718340	If you look at this map, that shows the magnitude of the impact on the sectors that the color
718340	724360	red means that there were delays in the order of 45 minutes or above per flight.
724360	729220	On days such as this, many airlines will choose to fly around France as to be less delayed
729220	734780	but, of course, the ATC centers in the surrounding countries need to be able to cope with demand.
734780	741740	Starting from three to four days before this event is confirmed, we would coordinate with
741740	749860	Spain, North African countries, Algeria, Tunisia, we would coordinate with Switzerland, Italy,
749860	757860	Germany, Calgary, we would coordinate with Maastricht and UK to be able to get extra
757860	762620	capacity for all those who have to go out.
762620	770780	So, one alternative route from UK to go down to south of Spain and a continuation on that,
770780	772660	what we call tango.
772660	777740	Tango route takes planes way out west into oceanic airspace to take a wide curve around
777740	781820	French airspace and is commonly flown when French airspace is restricted.
781820	784260	It is, of course, not efficient.
784260	788540	A flight from Alicante to London, for example, which normally takes just two hours, would
788540	792980	take over three by using tango route but, overall, it would typically arrive earlier
792980	796700	than if they waited for approval to fly through French airspace.
796700	801460	What made the 9th of May even worse is that drones were spotted at Frankfurt airport meaning
801460	804260	all arrivals and departures were stopped.
804260	812260	What we do, we immediately get in contact with all the airports around, if you like.
812260	831580	Eurocontrol will get information from the surrounding airports on how many diverted
831580	836380	aircraft they can handle and passes this information on airlines so they can quickly book a diversion
836380	838540	slot for their aircraft.
838540	844460	All told, there were over 300,000 minutes of delays on May 9th but initial calculations
844460	848620	determined that there was the potential for over 1 million minutes of delays which means
848620	853220	that Eurocontrol likely succeeded in their task of improving the day.
853220	857540	Eurocontrol's network manager room is expected to be quite busy in the coming months.
857540	862380	Right now, in early June, they already know summer 2019 is going to be messy.
862380	866380	It's the busiest period of the year for flights and there's actually less air traffic
866380	872780	control capacity than there was in summer 2018 when they had 26 million minutes of delays.
872780	877400	They fear this summer could be worse but, they made their action plan months ago and
877400	881680	will be here non-stop through the coming months to make the summer travel season as smooth
881680	882980	as it can be.
882980	887280	Overall, this room, air traffic control centers, and the rest of the world's air traffic
887280	892340	management infrastructure are crucial tools to make sure that routine, uneventful flights
892340	896680	like London to Frankfurt stay uneventful.
896680	899400	One thing that aviation loves is checklists.
899400	903300	They make sure you complete crucial steps and that's why, when I launch something
903300	906780	new, I have my own checklist of crucial steps.
906780	910700	One of the first steps, after coming up with a name, is buying the domain name.
910700	915680	That's because I know that domains go fast and, if you wait too long, someone else might
915680	917260	take your perfect domain.
917260	922320	I recently launched a podcast, for example, and immediately bought the domain extremitiespodcast.com
922320	923320	through Hover.
923320	927720	I haven't even set up a website yet but, considering the low price, it was worth it
927720	932380	to me to sit on the domain and, for now, I took about 30 seconds to set up the domain
932380	935100	to redirect to the podcast download page.
935100	939280	No matter what you're doing, whether it be a YouTube channel, a podcast, a business,
939280	943900	or anything else, you should get your domain now before it's gone and Hover makes that
943900	945800	absurdly simple.
945800	950320	First of all, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you will get 10% off your first
950320	950880	domain.
