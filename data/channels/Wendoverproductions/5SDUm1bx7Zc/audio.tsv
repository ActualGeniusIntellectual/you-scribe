7180	10700	Among the many former British colonies that have grown into some of the world's most
10700	14260	developed countries, Australia is unique.
14260	19180	Specifically, its economy has developed into something unlike that of any other and a big
19180	24180	player in the story of that economy is China—for better or worse.
24180	27840	To understand China's role in Australia and the problem this poses down under, one
27840	32520	has to start in a very different place—the United States.
32520	36400	If it were not for the US, Australia might not exist.
36400	40180	Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Britain would primarily send their prisoners to the
40180	43280	American colonies when sentenced to transportation.
43280	47260	Once the colonies became the independent country of the United States, Britain needed to find
47260	52480	a new place to put their convicts and for that, they chose what is now Sydney.
52480	55920	The first fleet of convicts who arrived in Botany Bay were the origins of what is now
55920	60440	the country of Australia and they might not have made the long trek to there if not for
60440	62840	the founding of the United States.
62840	68060	Beyond just this, the history of Australia and the history of the US are eerily similar
68060	69400	and interlinked.
69400	75360	The two countries' founding are offset from each other by 180 years, but parallel significantly.
75360	79440	Australia is almost the exact same size as the contiguous United States and even has
79440	82020	similar dimensions to the US.
82020	87260	Both nations include similarly diverse landscapes and climates, and both started in the east.
87260	91500	They then each expanded west, taking over indigenous land, largely fueled by the discovery
91500	93340	of gold and its subsequent mining.
93340	97800	While the scale is obviously quite different, both nations were quite isolated by distance
97800	102220	to the European world, although close to a number of other European colonies.
102220	105620	Both nations started with their small British populations and then grew primarily through
105620	109500	immigration from English-speaking countries, secondly through immigration from non-English-speaking
109500	113180	European countries, and thirdly through immigration from the rest of the world.
113180	117140	They even share the same story in the founding of their capital cities—they each built
117140	121500	a planned city in a central location between their two major population centers as to not
121500	123420	favor one over the other.
123420	127800	The similarities go on and on, but the point is that Australia and the US were largely
127800	132200	dealt the same cards but got vastly different results.
132200	136520	The US quickly developed into one of the most politically, economically, and socially powerful
136520	140800	countries on earth, with a population well over 300 million.
140800	146540	Australia, however, never grew into more than a small regional power with a small population
146540	148400	of just 25 million.
148400	151800	Now, Australia is no doubt a highly successful nation.
151800	155680	It's among the world's most wealthy countries, the world's most developed countries, it
155680	159440	has one of the world's lowest poverty rates, and is one of the highest scoring in the World
159440	160440	Happiness Index.
160440	164200	What the country is definitively not, though, is a superpower.
164200	168100	While you can never forget the role of pure chance, given the similar starting position
168100	173480	of both countries, the first thing one has to look at for a reason behind this is Australia's
173480	174480	geography.
174480	179640	Despite their similar sizes, what differentiates Australia from the US is its desolation.
179640	184840	About 35% of the landmass is considered desert, which generally cannot sustain large population
184840	185840	centers.
185840	189580	There are, of course, exceptions to this, most notably in the Middle East where huge
189580	194180	cities such as Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh sprung up in the middle of deserts, but each of these
194180	198420	largely developed as a result of oil booms in their respective countries.
198420	202620	While the deserts of Australia do have oil deposits, none of these are at a similar scale
202620	206900	to those of the Middle East, have not been significantly exploited, and, in addition,
206900	211900	it's largely Perth, on the western coast, that has emerged as a hub for oil rather than
211900	213340	an inland city.
213340	218440	With limited arable land and a harsh climate, the inland of Australia just isn't conducive
218440	220700	to most human life.
220740	224680	This results in a fairly striking population density map.
224680	230360	Just five major population centers have emerged—Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth.
230360	232980	Each of these is directly on the coast.
232980	236920	The largest city in Australia that's not directly on the coast, in fact, is Canberra,
236920	241400	the capital, which has a population of just 400,000 and was a planned city, meaning its
241400	246380	development cannot be a perfect indicator for the viability of inland life in Australia.
246380	250220	Even then, it sits a mere 70 miles or 115 kilometers from the coast.
250220	254620	If you're talking about population centers that are significantly offset from the coast,
254620	259300	in the outback, as it's called, the largest would probably be Alice Springs—a northern
259300	262380	territory town of just 24,000.
262380	266160	This desolation can be further exemplified by the country's road network.
266160	270260	The primary highway linking the population centers of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and
270260	275100	Adelaide to Perth is just a single two-lane road traversing the southern coast of the
275100	276100	country.
276100	279500	The same is the case for the Stewart Highway, which serves as the primary link from the
279500	284660	south coast and the north coast up the center of the country—it, too, is just a two-lane
284660	285700	road.
285700	290180	What this all means is that much of Australia's land just doesn't lend itself to the development
290180	294140	of large-scale human settlements, leaving it fairly empty.
294140	298660	Australia's vastness served a crucial role in developing it into one of the world's
298660	300220	wealthiest economies, though.
300220	303760	The country is now the world's largest exporter of minerals.
303760	309140	It has huge amounts of coal, iron, lead, diamonds, gold, uranium, and more, mostly
309140	311560	in its vast, open outback.
311560	315940	That means that the primary economic activity in Australia's interior is mining, and with
315940	320400	natural resources making up a majority of the country's exports, it were these minerals
320400	324280	that played a major part in growing Australia into a wealthy economy.
324280	328760	They also cemented who Australia's economic partners would be.
328760	333400	Nearly 30% of Australia's exports go to China, primarily driven by China's significant
333400	334600	demand for minerals.
334600	339900	China, in fact, in the number one spot, buys more from Australia than the number two, three,
339900	343640	and four countries combined—Japan, the US, and South Korea.
343640	347000	Beyond just Chinese companies buying minerals from Australian mining companies to use in
347000	352080	their factories, there are also sizable amounts of investment coming in from Chinese companies.
352080	356760	Overall, it's safe to say that the Australian mining sector would not be what it is without
356760	361900	China, but Australia also relies on the billion people up north to act as customers for another
361900	365220	crucial aspect of their economy—education.
365220	369260	As strange as it might sound, universities, which in most cases are non-profits, form
369260	373420	a sizable part of the Australian economy as Australian universities are some of the most
373420	377000	successful in the world at attracting international students.
377000	382740	The country is home to about 875,000 international students across all types of schools.
382740	389220	Now, of course, remember, the entire population of Australia is only about 25 million.
389220	394860	What that means is that, in the entire country, one out of every 28 people are international
394860	395920	students.
395920	401060	Of these international students, the highest proportion by far are Chinese at 30%.
401060	405480	That represents a quarter of a million Chinese students studying in Australia.
405480	410380	On the flip side, that means that at any given time, one out of every 5,000 Chinese people
410380	412160	are studying in Australia.
412160	416700	Within universities, Chinese make up 10% of the average student body, however, considering
416700	421580	they tend to cluster together, certain universities have far higher proportions.
421580	427380	At UNSW the proportion is 23%, at University of Sydney it's 24%, and numbers are similar
427380	429140	at other hotspots.
429140	433660	All in all, these Chinese students contribute more than about $10 billion a year to the
433660	435520	Australian economy.
435520	439220	There are also plenty of other sectors that play a part of China's huge economic influence
439220	443200	in Australia such as tourism, manufacturing, services, and more.
443200	449660	Given how much the two economies are interlinked, therefore, as China has risen so too has Australia.
449660	454280	This link to the success of one of the biggest economic success stories ever has helped Australia
454280	461560	earn an impressive record—it has gone 28 years, since 1991, without a recession.
461560	464440	While the rest of the world struggled through the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of
464440	469080	the dot-com bubble, and the Great Recession, Australia just kept on going with quarter
469080	472580	after quarter after quarter of economic growth.
472580	478380	By most measures, in modern history, no developed country has ever gone such a long period without
478380	479620	a recession.
479620	482460	But this all, of course, has a flip-side.
482460	486140	Such heavy economic reliance on a country that politically Australia doesn't always
486140	488340	agree with is dangerous.
488340	492900	An Australian-Chinese trade war would certainly cause a lot more damage down under than up
492900	493900	north.
493900	498940	At the same time, there are quite a few efforts by China to influence Australia.
498940	503100	Australia has made plenty of attempts to tip politics in the country in their favor.
503100	507860	As one small example, Chinese Communist Party-run or affiliated WeChat accounts—a popular
507860	512700	social network in China—released post-critical and mocking of Australian politician and current
512700	517260	Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the run-up to the May 2019 Australian election.
517260	521540	Beyond that, the Chinese government has been known to unofficially sponsor certain pro-China
521540	526140	ethnically Chinese candidates for various Australian offices through a variety of methods.
526140	530220	In media, China has been known to impart vast control over Chinese language outlets
530220	534940	in Australia, and responds harshly to criticism through defamation lawsuits and more.
534940	539140	On university campuses, the Chinese Communist Party is known to have vast amounts of influence,
539140	543260	with accusations that the government has built spy networks within Australian universities
543260	546000	to monitor Chinese students and their political views.
546000	550420	In one instance, a Chinese student studying in Brisbane participated in a rally supporting
550420	555140	the anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, and days later, the student's family back in
555140	557440	China were visited by the authorities.
557440	562160	There is a very clear but unspoken threat by China to Australia—if you make things
562160	566520	difficult for us politically, we'll make things difficult for you economically.
566520	571220	How things typically work in China is that, in order to achieve business success even
571220	575700	when running a fully private company, one needs to be cozy with the Chinese Communist
575700	577660	Party that runs the government.
577660	582260	Therefore, even if a Chinese company is fully private, it knows that it needs to act in
582260	585100	a way that aligns with China's politics.
585100	588820	Of course, while some of China's tools of economic warfare are more traditional,
588820	593580	like tariffs, a lot of its influence stems from the actions of the private sector.
593580	597940	Any private Chinese company knows that, if Australia suddenly took a hard, pro-Hong Kong
597940	602540	independence stance, for example, the CCP might not be happy about continued business
602540	603540	with the country.
603540	608540	Australia is therefore in a tricky spot, where it's a Western country socially and politically,
608540	612060	but in many ways, an Eastern country economically.
612060	617500	As a result, taking a political stance against any actions by China comes at a much higher
617500	620940	cost than that of a less economically linked country.
620940	624820	Australia, quite literally, cannot afford to lose China.
624820	630380	A trade war with China on the scale of the US's would devastate the Australian economy.
630380	635260	China no doubt has done wonders for Australia, but the point is that too much reliance on
635260	640460	any economy, no matter how strong that economy may be, is a risky strategy.
640460	644300	Even that strong economy is run by a foreign government that can adjust its flows in an
644300	646300	instant, that's even riskier.
646300	651060	According to one study run by the Reserve Bank of Australia, if China's GDP contracted
651060	657220	by just 5%, that would result in Australia's GDP falling by 2.5%.
657220	663460	That is a clear-cut case of economic reliance so, if Australia wants to keep up its unprecedented
663460	669620	period of economic growth irregardless of how China's doing, diversification is crucial.
