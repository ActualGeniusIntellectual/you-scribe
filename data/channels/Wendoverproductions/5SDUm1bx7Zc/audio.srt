other e-commerce businesses.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,700
Among the many former British colonies that have grown into some of the world's most

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,260
developed countries, Australia is unique.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,180
Specifically, its economy has developed into something unlike that of any other and a big

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,180
player in the story of that economy is China—for better or worse.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,840
To understand China's role in Australia and the problem this poses down under, one

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,520
has to start in a very different place—the United States.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,400
If it were not for the US, Australia might not exist.

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,180
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Britain would primarily send their prisoners to the

11
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,280
American colonies when sentenced to transportation.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,260
Once the colonies became the independent country of the United States, Britain needed to find

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,480
a new place to put their convicts and for that, they chose what is now Sydney.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,920
The first fleet of convicts who arrived in Botany Bay were the origins of what is now

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,440
the country of Australia and they might not have made the long trek to there if not for

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,840
the founding of the United States.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,060
Beyond just this, the history of Australia and the history of the US are eerily similar

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,400
and interlinked.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:15,360
The two countries' founding are offset from each other by 180 years, but parallel significantly.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,440
Australia is almost the exact same size as the contiguous United States and even has

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,020
similar dimensions to the US.

22
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,260
Both nations include similarly diverse landscapes and climates, and both started in the east.

23
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,500
They then each expanded west, taking over indigenous land, largely fueled by the discovery

24
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,340
of gold and its subsequent mining.

25
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,800
While the scale is obviously quite different, both nations were quite isolated by distance

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,220
to the European world, although close to a number of other European colonies.

27
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,620
Both nations started with their small British populations and then grew primarily through

28
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,500
immigration from English-speaking countries, secondly through immigration from non-English-speaking

29
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,180
European countries, and thirdly through immigration from the rest of the world.

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,140
They even share the same story in the founding of their capital cities—they each built

31
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,500
a planned city in a central location between their two major population centers as to not

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,420
favor one over the other.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,800
The similarities go on and on, but the point is that Australia and the US were largely

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,200
dealt the same cards but got vastly different results.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,520
The US quickly developed into one of the most politically, economically, and socially powerful

36
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,800
countries on earth, with a population well over 300 million.

37
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,540
Australia, however, never grew into more than a small regional power with a small population

38
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,400
of just 25 million.

39
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Now, Australia is no doubt a highly successful nation.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,680
It's among the world's most wealthy countries, the world's most developed countries, it

41
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
has one of the world's lowest poverty rates, and is one of the highest scoring in the World

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Happiness Index.

43
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,200
What the country is definitively not, though, is a superpower.

44
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,100
While you can never forget the role of pure chance, given the similar starting position

45
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,480
of both countries, the first thing one has to look at for a reason behind this is Australia's

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,480
geography.

47
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,640
Despite their similar sizes, what differentiates Australia from the US is its desolation.

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,840
About 35% of the landmass is considered desert, which generally cannot sustain large population

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
centers.

50
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,580
There are, of course, exceptions to this, most notably in the Middle East where huge

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,180
cities such as Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh sprung up in the middle of deserts, but each of these

52
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,420
largely developed as a result of oil booms in their respective countries.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,620
While the deserts of Australia do have oil deposits, none of these are at a similar scale

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,900
to those of the Middle East, have not been significantly exploited, and, in addition,

55
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:31,900
it's largely Perth, on the western coast, that has emerged as a hub for oil rather than

56
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,340
an inland city.

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,440
With limited arable land and a harsh climate, the inland of Australia just isn't conducive

58
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,700
to most human life.

59
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,680
This results in a fairly striking population density map.

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,360
Just five major population centers have emerged—Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth.

61
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,980
Each of these is directly on the coast.

62
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,920
The largest city in Australia that's not directly on the coast, in fact, is Canberra,

63
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,400
the capital, which has a population of just 400,000 and was a planned city, meaning its

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,380
development cannot be a perfect indicator for the viability of inland life in Australia.

65
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,220
Even then, it sits a mere 70 miles or 115 kilometers from the coast.

66
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,620
If you're talking about population centers that are significantly offset from the coast,

67
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,300
in the outback, as it's called, the largest would probably be Alice Springs—a northern

68
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,380
territory town of just 24,000.

69
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,160
This desolation can be further exemplified by the country's road network.

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,260
The primary highway linking the population centers of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and

71
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,100
Adelaide to Perth is just a single two-lane road traversing the southern coast of the

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
country.

73
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,500
The same is the case for the Stewart Highway, which serves as the primary link from the

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,660
south coast and the north coast up the center of the country—it, too, is just a two-lane

75
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,700
road.

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,180
What this all means is that much of Australia's land just doesn't lend itself to the development

77
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,140
of large-scale human settlements, leaving it fairly empty.

78
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,660
Australia's vastness served a crucial role in developing it into one of the world's

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,220
wealthiest economies, though.

80
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,760
The country is now the world's largest exporter of minerals.

81
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,140
It has huge amounts of coal, iron, lead, diamonds, gold, uranium, and more, mostly

82
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,560
in its vast, open outback.

83
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,940
That means that the primary economic activity in Australia's interior is mining, and with

84
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,400
natural resources making up a majority of the country's exports, it were these minerals

85
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,280
that played a major part in growing Australia into a wealthy economy.

86
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,760
They also cemented who Australia's economic partners would be.

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,400
Nearly 30% of Australia's exports go to China, primarily driven by China's significant

88
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,600
demand for minerals.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,900
China, in fact, in the number one spot, buys more from Australia than the number two, three,

90
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,640
and four countries combined—Japan, the US, and South Korea.

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,000
Beyond just Chinese companies buying minerals from Australian mining companies to use in

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,080
their factories, there are also sizable amounts of investment coming in from Chinese companies.

93
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,760
Overall, it's safe to say that the Australian mining sector would not be what it is without

94
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,900
China, but Australia also relies on the billion people up north to act as customers for another

95
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,220
crucial aspect of their economy—education.

96
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,260
As strange as it might sound, universities, which in most cases are non-profits, form

97
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:13,420
a sizable part of the Australian economy as Australian universities are some of the most

98
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,000
successful in the world at attracting international students.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,740
The country is home to about 875,000 international students across all types of schools.

100
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,220
Now, of course, remember, the entire population of Australia is only about 25 million.

101
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,860
What that means is that, in the entire country, one out of every 28 people are international

102
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,920
students.

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,060
Of these international students, the highest proportion by far are Chinese at 30%.

104
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,480
That represents a quarter of a million Chinese students studying in Australia.

105
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,380
On the flip side, that means that at any given time, one out of every 5,000 Chinese people

106
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,160
are studying in Australia.

107
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,700
Within universities, Chinese make up 10% of the average student body, however, considering

108
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:01,580
they tend to cluster together, certain universities have far higher proportions.

109
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:07,380
At UNSW the proportion is 23%, at University of Sydney it's 24%, and numbers are similar

110
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,140
at other hotspots.

111
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,660
All in all, these Chinese students contribute more than about $10 billion a year to the

112
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,520
Australian economy.

113
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,220
There are also plenty of other sectors that play a part of China's huge economic influence

114
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,200
in Australia such as tourism, manufacturing, services, and more.

115
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,660
Given how much the two economies are interlinked, therefore, as China has risen so too has Australia.

116
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,280
This link to the success of one of the biggest economic success stories ever has helped Australia

117
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,560
earn an impressive record—it has gone 28 years, since 1991, without a recession.

118
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,440
While the rest of the world struggled through the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of

119
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:49,080
the dot-com bubble, and the Great Recession, Australia just kept on going with quarter

120
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,580
after quarter after quarter of economic growth.

121
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,380
By most measures, in modern history, no developed country has ever gone such a long period without

122
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,620
a recession.

123
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,460
But this all, of course, has a flip-side.

124
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,140
Such heavy economic reliance on a country that politically Australia doesn't always

125
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:08,340
agree with is dangerous.

126
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,900
An Australian-Chinese trade war would certainly cause a lot more damage down under than up

127
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
north.

128
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,940
At the same time, there are quite a few efforts by China to influence Australia.

129
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,100
Australia has made plenty of attempts to tip politics in the country in their favor.

130
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,860
As one small example, Chinese Communist Party-run or affiliated WeChat accounts—a popular

131
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,700
social network in China—released post-critical and mocking of Australian politician and current

132
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,260
Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the run-up to the May 2019 Australian election.

133
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,540
Beyond that, the Chinese government has been known to unofficially sponsor certain pro-China

134
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,140
ethnically Chinese candidates for various Australian offices through a variety of methods.

135
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,220
In media, China has been known to impart vast control over Chinese language outlets

136
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,940
in Australia, and responds harshly to criticism through defamation lawsuits and more.

137
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,140
On university campuses, the Chinese Communist Party is known to have vast amounts of influence,

138
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,260
with accusations that the government has built spy networks within Australian universities

139
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,000
to monitor Chinese students and their political views.

140
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,420
In one instance, a Chinese student studying in Brisbane participated in a rally supporting

141
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,140
the anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, and days later, the student's family back in

142
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,440
China were visited by the authorities.

143
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,160
There is a very clear but unspoken threat by China to Australia—if you make things

144
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,520
difficult for us politically, we'll make things difficult for you economically.

145
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,220
How things typically work in China is that, in order to achieve business success even

146
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,700
when running a fully private company, one needs to be cozy with the Chinese Communist

147
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
Party that runs the government.

148
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,260
Therefore, even if a Chinese company is fully private, it knows that it needs to act in

149
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,100
a way that aligns with China's politics.

150
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,820
Of course, while some of China's tools of economic warfare are more traditional,

151
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,580
like tariffs, a lot of its influence stems from the actions of the private sector.

152
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,940
Any private Chinese company knows that, if Australia suddenly took a hard, pro-Hong Kong

153
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,540
independence stance, for example, the CCP might not be happy about continued business

154
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
with the country.

155
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,540
Australia is therefore in a tricky spot, where it's a Western country socially and politically,

156
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,060
but in many ways, an Eastern country economically.

157
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,500
As a result, taking a political stance against any actions by China comes at a much higher

158
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,940
cost than that of a less economically linked country.

159
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,820
Australia, quite literally, cannot afford to lose China.

160
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,380
A trade war with China on the scale of the US's would devastate the Australian economy.

161
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,260
China no doubt has done wonders for Australia, but the point is that too much reliance on

162
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,460
any economy, no matter how strong that economy may be, is a risky strategy.

163
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,300
Even that strong economy is run by a foreign government that can adjust its flows in an

164
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
instant, that's even riskier.

165
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,060
According to one study run by the Reserve Bank of Australia, if China's GDP contracted

166
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:57,220
by just 5%, that would result in Australia's GDP falling by 2.5%.

167
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,460
That is a clear-cut case of economic reliance so, if Australia wants to keep up its unprecedented

168
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:09,620
period of economic growth irregardless of how China's doing, diversification is crucial.

169
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,540
I know a lot of Wendover Productions viewers are the type of people who already run or

170
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,400
would like to run their own businesses, and one of the fastest growing industries out

171
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,900
there is of course, e-commerce.

172
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,960
Traditionally, starting any sort of business that involves selling physical goods required

173
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,180
a ton of work to build out the infrastructure necessary to do that, there was a huge barrier

174
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,780
to entry, but nowadays, it's super simple, especially thanks to platforms like Shopify.

175
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,060
Shopify now powers more than a million online businesses meaning you've almost certainly

176
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,460
bought something through Shopify, but on the merchant side, it makes setting up, marketing,

177
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,260
running, and managing your business easy.

178
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,900
I, of course, know, since it's what I've used for ages to run my Wendover Productions

179
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
merch store.

180
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,540
