This video is made possible by Shopify—the platform behind Wendover and thousands of

00:04.400 --> 00:07.180
other e-commerce businesses.

00:07.180 --> 00:10.700
Among the many former British colonies that have grown into some of the world's most

00:10.700 --> 00:14.260
developed countries, Australia is unique.

00:14.260 --> 00:19.180
Specifically, its economy has developed into something unlike that of any other and a big

00:19.180 --> 00:24.180
player in the story of that economy is China—for better or worse.

00:24.180 --> 00:27.840
To understand China's role in Australia and the problem this poses down under, one

00:27.840 --> 00:32.520
has to start in a very different place—the United States.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.400
If it were not for the US, Australia might not exist.

00:36.400 --> 00:40.180
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Britain would primarily send their prisoners to the

00:40.180 --> 00:43.280
American colonies when sentenced to transportation.

00:43.280 --> 00:47.260
Once the colonies became the independent country of the United States, Britain needed to find

00:47.260 --> 00:52.480
a new place to put their convicts and for that, they chose what is now Sydney.

00:52.480 --> 00:55.920
The first fleet of convicts who arrived in Botany Bay were the origins of what is now

00:55.920 --> 01:00.440
the country of Australia and they might not have made the long trek to there if not for

01:00.440 --> 01:02.840
the founding of the United States.

01:02.840 --> 01:08.060
Beyond just this, the history of Australia and the history of the US are eerily similar

01:08.060 --> 01:09.400
and interlinked.

01:09.400 --> 01:15.360
The two countries' founding are offset from each other by 180 years, but parallel significantly.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.440
Australia is almost the exact same size as the contiguous United States and even has

01:19.440 --> 01:22.020
similar dimensions to the US.

01:22.020 --> 01:27.260
Both nations include similarly diverse landscapes and climates, and both started in the east.

01:27.260 --> 01:31.500
They then each expanded west, taking over indigenous land, largely fueled by the discovery

01:31.500 --> 01:33.340
of gold and its subsequent mining.

01:33.340 --> 01:37.800
While the scale is obviously quite different, both nations were quite isolated by distance

01:37.800 --> 01:42.220
to the European world, although close to a number of other European colonies.

01:42.220 --> 01:45.620
Both nations started with their small British populations and then grew primarily through

01:45.620 --> 01:49.500
immigration from English-speaking countries, secondly through immigration from non-English-speaking

01:49.500 --> 01:53.180
European countries, and thirdly through immigration from the rest of the world.

01:53.180 --> 01:57.140
They even share the same story in the founding of their capital cities—they each built

01:57.140 --> 02:01.500
a planned city in a central location between their two major population centers as to not

02:01.500 --> 02:03.420
favor one over the other.

02:03.420 --> 02:07.800
The similarities go on and on, but the point is that Australia and the US were largely

02:07.800 --> 02:12.200
dealt the same cards but got vastly different results.

02:12.200 --> 02:16.520
The US quickly developed into one of the most politically, economically, and socially powerful

02:16.520 --> 02:20.800
countries on earth, with a population well over 300 million.

02:20.800 --> 02:26.540
Australia, however, never grew into more than a small regional power with a small population

02:26.540 --> 02:28.400
of just 25 million.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.800
Now, Australia is no doubt a highly successful nation.

02:31.800 --> 02:35.680
It's among the world's most wealthy countries, the world's most developed countries, it

02:35.680 --> 02:39.440
has one of the world's lowest poverty rates, and is one of the highest scoring in the World

02:39.440 --> 02:40.440
Happiness Index.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.200
What the country is definitively not, though, is a superpower.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.100
While you can never forget the role of pure chance, given the similar starting position

02:48.100 --> 02:53.480
of both countries, the first thing one has to look at for a reason behind this is Australia's

02:53.480 --> 02:54.480
geography.

02:54.480 --> 02:59.640
Despite their similar sizes, what differentiates Australia from the US is its desolation.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.840
About 35% of the landmass is considered desert, which generally cannot sustain large population

03:04.840 --> 03:05.840
centers.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.580
There are, of course, exceptions to this, most notably in the Middle East where huge

03:09.580 --> 03:14.180
cities such as Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh sprung up in the middle of deserts, but each of these

03:14.180 --> 03:18.420
largely developed as a result of oil booms in their respective countries.

03:18.420 --> 03:22.620
While the deserts of Australia do have oil deposits, none of these are at a similar scale

03:22.620 --> 03:26.900
to those of the Middle East, have not been significantly exploited, and, in addition,

03:26.900 --> 03:31.900
it's largely Perth, on the western coast, that has emerged as a hub for oil rather than

03:31.900 --> 03:33.340
an inland city.

03:33.340 --> 03:38.440
With limited arable land and a harsh climate, the inland of Australia just isn't conducive

03:38.440 --> 03:40.700
to most human life.

03:40.740 --> 03:44.680
This results in a fairly striking population density map.

03:44.680 --> 03:50.360
Just five major population centers have emerged—Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.980
Each of these is directly on the coast.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.920
The largest city in Australia that's not directly on the coast, in fact, is Canberra,

03:56.920 --> 04:01.400
the capital, which has a population of just 400,000 and was a planned city, meaning its

04:01.400 --> 04:06.380
development cannot be a perfect indicator for the viability of inland life in Australia.

04:06.380 --> 04:10.220
Even then, it sits a mere 70 miles or 115 kilometers from the coast.

04:10.220 --> 04:14.620
If you're talking about population centers that are significantly offset from the coast,

04:14.620 --> 04:19.300
in the outback, as it's called, the largest would probably be Alice Springs—a northern

04:19.300 --> 04:22.380
territory town of just 24,000.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.160
This desolation can be further exemplified by the country's road network.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.260
The primary highway linking the population centers of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and

04:30.260 --> 04:35.100
Adelaide to Perth is just a single two-lane road traversing the southern coast of the

04:35.100 --> 04:36.100
country.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.500
The same is the case for the Stewart Highway, which serves as the primary link from the

04:39.500 --> 04:44.660
south coast and the north coast up the center of the country—it, too, is just a two-lane

04:44.660 --> 04:45.700
road.

04:45.700 --> 04:50.180
What this all means is that much of Australia's land just doesn't lend itself to the development

04:50.180 --> 04:54.140
of large-scale human settlements, leaving it fairly empty.

04:54.140 --> 04:58.660
Australia's vastness served a crucial role in developing it into one of the world's

04:58.660 --> 05:00.220
wealthiest economies, though.

05:00.220 --> 05:03.760
The country is now the world's largest exporter of minerals.

05:03.760 --> 05:09.140
It has huge amounts of coal, iron, lead, diamonds, gold, uranium, and more, mostly

05:09.140 --> 05:11.560
in its vast, open outback.

05:11.560 --> 05:15.940
That means that the primary economic activity in Australia's interior is mining, and with

05:15.940 --> 05:20.400
natural resources making up a majority of the country's exports, it were these minerals

05:20.400 --> 05:24.280
that played a major part in growing Australia into a wealthy economy.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.760
They also cemented who Australia's economic partners would be.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.400
Nearly 30% of Australia's exports go to China, primarily driven by China's significant

05:33.400 --> 05:34.600
demand for minerals.

05:34.600 --> 05:39.900
China, in fact, in the number one spot, buys more from Australia than the number two, three,

05:39.900 --> 05:43.640
and four countries combined—Japan, the US, and South Korea.

05:43.640 --> 05:47.000
Beyond just Chinese companies buying minerals from Australian mining companies to use in

05:47.000 --> 05:52.080
their factories, there are also sizable amounts of investment coming in from Chinese companies.

05:52.080 --> 05:56.760
Overall, it's safe to say that the Australian mining sector would not be what it is without

05:56.760 --> 06:01.900
China, but Australia also relies on the billion people up north to act as customers for another

06:01.900 --> 06:05.220
crucial aspect of their economy—education.

06:05.220 --> 06:09.260
As strange as it might sound, universities, which in most cases are non-profits, form

06:09.260 --> 06:13.420
a sizable part of the Australian economy as Australian universities are some of the most

06:13.420 --> 06:17.000
successful in the world at attracting international students.

06:17.000 --> 06:22.740
The country is home to about 875,000 international students across all types of schools.

06:22.740 --> 06:29.220
Now, of course, remember, the entire population of Australia is only about 25 million.

06:29.220 --> 06:34.860
What that means is that, in the entire country, one out of every 28 people are international

06:34.860 --> 06:35.920
students.

06:35.920 --> 06:41.060
Of these international students, the highest proportion by far are Chinese at 30%.

06:41.060 --> 06:45.480
That represents a quarter of a million Chinese students studying in Australia.

06:45.480 --> 06:50.380
On the flip side, that means that at any given time, one out of every 5,000 Chinese people

06:50.380 --> 06:52.160
are studying in Australia.

06:52.160 --> 06:56.700
Within universities, Chinese make up 10% of the average student body, however, considering

06:56.700 --> 07:01.580
they tend to cluster together, certain universities have far higher proportions.

07:01.580 --> 07:07.380
At UNSW the proportion is 23%, at University of Sydney it's 24%, and numbers are similar

07:07.380 --> 07:09.140
at other hotspots.

07:09.140 --> 07:13.660
All in all, these Chinese students contribute more than about $10 billion a year to the

07:13.660 --> 07:15.520
Australian economy.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.220
There are also plenty of other sectors that play a part of China's huge economic influence

07:19.220 --> 07:23.200
in Australia such as tourism, manufacturing, services, and more.

07:23.200 --> 07:29.660
Given how much the two economies are interlinked, therefore, as China has risen so too has Australia.

07:29.660 --> 07:34.280
This link to the success of one of the biggest economic success stories ever has helped Australia

07:34.280 --> 07:41.560
earn an impressive record—it has gone 28 years, since 1991, without a recession.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.440
While the rest of the world struggled through the Asian financial crisis, the collapse of

07:44.440 --> 07:49.080
the dot-com bubble, and the Great Recession, Australia just kept on going with quarter

07:49.080 --> 07:52.580
after quarter after quarter of economic growth.

07:52.580 --> 07:58.380
By most measures, in modern history, no developed country has ever gone such a long period without

07:58.380 --> 07:59.620
a recession.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.460
But this all, of course, has a flip-side.

08:02.460 --> 08:06.140
Such heavy economic reliance on a country that politically Australia doesn't always

08:06.140 --> 08:08.340
agree with is dangerous.

08:08.340 --> 08:12.900
An Australian-Chinese trade war would certainly cause a lot more damage down under than up

08:12.900 --> 08:13.900
north.

08:13.900 --> 08:18.940
At the same time, there are quite a few efforts by China to influence Australia.

08:18.940 --> 08:23.100
Australia has made plenty of attempts to tip politics in the country in their favor.

08:23.100 --> 08:27.860
As one small example, Chinese Communist Party-run or affiliated WeChat accounts—a popular

08:27.860 --> 08:32.700
social network in China—released post-critical and mocking of Australian politician and current

08:32.700 --> 08:37.260
Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the run-up to the May 2019 Australian election.

08:37.260 --> 08:41.540
Beyond that, the Chinese government has been known to unofficially sponsor certain pro-China

08:41.540 --> 08:46.140
ethnically Chinese candidates for various Australian offices through a variety of methods.

08:46.140 --> 08:50.220
In media, China has been known to impart vast control over Chinese language outlets

08:50.220 --> 08:54.940
in Australia, and responds harshly to criticism through defamation lawsuits and more.

08:54.940 --> 08:59.140
On university campuses, the Chinese Communist Party is known to have vast amounts of influence,

08:59.140 --> 09:03.260
with accusations that the government has built spy networks within Australian universities

09:03.260 --> 09:06.000
to monitor Chinese students and their political views.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.420
In one instance, a Chinese student studying in Brisbane participated in a rally supporting

09:10.420 --> 09:15.140
the anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, and days later, the student's family back in

09:15.140 --> 09:17.440
China were visited by the authorities.

09:17.440 --> 09:22.160
There is a very clear but unspoken threat by China to Australia—if you make things

09:22.160 --> 09:26.520
difficult for us politically, we'll make things difficult for you economically.

09:26.520 --> 09:31.220
How things typically work in China is that, in order to achieve business success even

09:31.220 --> 09:35.700
when running a fully private company, one needs to be cozy with the Chinese Communist

09:35.700 --> 09:37.660
Party that runs the government.

09:37.660 --> 09:42.260
Therefore, even if a Chinese company is fully private, it knows that it needs to act in

09:42.260 --> 09:45.100
a way that aligns with China's politics.

09:45.100 --> 09:48.820
Of course, while some of China's tools of economic warfare are more traditional,

09:48.820 --> 09:53.580
like tariffs, a lot of its influence stems from the actions of the private sector.

09:53.580 --> 09:57.940
Any private Chinese company knows that, if Australia suddenly took a hard, pro-Hong Kong

09:57.940 --> 10:02.540
independence stance, for example, the CCP might not be happy about continued business

10:02.540 --> 10:03.540
with the country.

10:03.540 --> 10:08.540
Australia is therefore in a tricky spot, where it's a Western country socially and politically,

10:08.540 --> 10:12.060
but in many ways, an Eastern country economically.

10:12.060 --> 10:17.500
As a result, taking a political stance against any actions by China comes at a much higher

10:17.500 --> 10:20.940
cost than that of a less economically linked country.

10:20.940 --> 10:24.820
Australia, quite literally, cannot afford to lose China.

10:24.820 --> 10:30.380
A trade war with China on the scale of the US's would devastate the Australian economy.

10:30.380 --> 10:35.260
China no doubt has done wonders for Australia, but the point is that too much reliance on

10:35.260 --> 10:40.460
any economy, no matter how strong that economy may be, is a risky strategy.

10:40.460 --> 10:44.300
Even that strong economy is run by a foreign government that can adjust its flows in an

10:44.300 --> 10:46.300
instant, that's even riskier.

10:46.300 --> 10:51.060
According to one study run by the Reserve Bank of Australia, if China's GDP contracted

10:51.060 --> 10:57.220
by just 5%, that would result in Australia's GDP falling by 2.5%.

10:57.220 --> 11:03.460
That is a clear-cut case of economic reliance so, if Australia wants to keep up its unprecedented

11:03.460 --> 11:09.620
period of economic growth irregardless of how China's doing, diversification is crucial.

11:09.620 --> 11:14.540
I know a lot of Wendover Productions viewers are the type of people who already run or

11:14.540 --> 11:18.400
would like to run their own businesses, and one of the fastest growing industries out

11:18.400 --> 11:20.900
there is of course, e-commerce.

11:20.900 --> 11:24.960
Traditionally, starting any sort of business that involves selling physical goods required

11:24.960 --> 11:29.180
a ton of work to build out the infrastructure necessary to do that, there was a huge barrier

11:29.180 --> 11:34.780
to entry, but nowadays, it's super simple, especially thanks to platforms like Shopify.

11:34.780 --> 11:39.060

11:39.060 --> 11:43.460
bought something through Shopify, but on the merchant side, it makes setting up, marketing,

11:43.460 --> 11:45.260

11:49.900 --> 11:50.900
merch store.
