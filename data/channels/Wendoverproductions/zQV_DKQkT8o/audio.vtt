00:10.020 --> 00:14.520
Political alliances manifest themselves here—on the voting floor of the United Nations General

00:14.520 --> 00:16.880
Assembly in New York, New York.

00:16.880 --> 00:20.960
In this room, countries impose legislation that carries weight worldwide and so what

00:20.960 --> 00:25.560
happens in this room is the physical materialization of the world's politics.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.160
47 years ago, exactly that happened when one of the General Assembly's most consequential

00:30.160 --> 00:31.320
votes occurred.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.640
China, you see, essentially has two governments.

00:34.640 --> 00:39.080
There's the Republic of China which used to control the mainland and Taiwan but today

00:39.080 --> 00:42.800
only administers Taiwan and there's the People's Republic of China which controls

00:42.800 --> 00:43.960
the mainland.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.000
Both claim to be the rightful governments of all of the Chinese territory—both Taiwan

00:48.000 --> 00:52.760
and the mainland—and so back in 1971, the United Nations had to decide which government

00:52.760 --> 00:54.360
would represent China.

00:54.360 --> 00:58.520
Essentially, the question was which government was the rightful leader of the territory as

00:58.520 --> 01:01.320
there could only be one in the United Nations.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.600
The US was the main superpower opposing the People's Republic representing China as

01:05.600 --> 01:09.880
it had a strong political and military alliance with the Republic of China government and

01:09.880 --> 01:14.400
so the vote was essentially the US's sphere of influence versus the world.

01:14.400 --> 01:19.180
Among the 35 countries that voted against the People's Republic were much of Africa—the

01:19.180 --> 01:24.280
Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Liberia, Niger, South Africa, and plenty of other

01:24.280 --> 01:26.160
others that sided with the US.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.840
Despite the US's effort, the resolution ended up passing and the representative government

01:29.840 --> 01:33.600
for China in the UN was switched to the People's Republic of China but what's interesting

01:33.600 --> 01:38.640
about this vote is not the result, it's who voted against the People's Republic.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.780
Since that 1971 vote, you see, something has changed.

01:42.780 --> 01:47.960
In 2007, the UN General Assembly met once again to vote on whether to adopt a resolution

01:47.960 --> 01:50.960
condemning the human rights situation in North Korea.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.920
As one of North Korea's strongest allies, this vote was China and its sphere of influence

01:54.920 --> 01:56.520
versus the world.

01:56.520 --> 02:02.760
In this vote, though, only Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia,

02:02.760 --> 02:06.880
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, and Tanzania voted against China.

02:06.880 --> 02:12.200
All the 43 other African countries either abstained or voted no along with China because

02:12.200 --> 02:16.800
in the 40 years between these votes, political ties changed.

02:16.800 --> 02:19.440
Africa no longer bows to the US.

02:19.440 --> 02:23.340
Much of the continent is now economically and politically aligned with the world's

02:23.340 --> 02:26.200
fastest emerging superpower—China.

02:26.200 --> 02:30.240
The simple answer for why this is is because China has pumped huge amounts of money into

02:30.240 --> 02:31.600
the continent of Africa.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.560
They're buying allies.

02:33.560 --> 02:38.720
For example, China built a $3.2 billion dollar railway in Kenya trekking the 300 miles from

02:38.720 --> 02:43.560
Nairobi, the capital, to Mombasa, the second largest city and primary port, in 4 hours

02:43.560 --> 02:44.560
and 30 minutes.

02:44.560 --> 02:48.800
That's faster than what the fastest train in the US, the Acela Express, takes to travel

02:48.800 --> 02:51.960
the equivalent distance from Philadelphia to Boston.

02:51.960 --> 02:56.700
China also built a $526 million dollar dam in Guinea which helped push the country from

02:56.700 --> 03:00.900
having constant power shortages to making more energy than it needs and selling the

03:00.900 --> 03:03.160
extra capacity to its neighbors.

03:03.160 --> 03:08.640
China also built a $475 million dollar light rail system in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the

03:08.640 --> 03:12.800
first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa, designed as a way to combat the capital's crippling

03:12.800 --> 03:13.800
traffic.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.380
These are only a sampling.

03:15.380 --> 03:19.700
There are literally hundreds of others of Chinese infrastructure projects in Africa

03:19.700 --> 03:20.740
each year.

03:20.740 --> 03:24.940
All across the continent, China is playing a part in projects both big and small that

03:24.940 --> 03:27.140
are transforming African economies.

03:27.140 --> 03:31.180
It's important to note that these projects are not, though, free.

03:31.180 --> 03:34.980
Each of these three were financed by loans granted by China's state-owned and controlled

03:34.980 --> 03:39.160
export-import bank and these loans do, of course, need to be paid back by the countries

03:39.160 --> 03:40.380
granted them.

03:40.380 --> 03:44.220
Large African infrastructure projects, though, would be viewed as risky by any traditional

03:44.220 --> 03:48.220
bank and would therefore struggle to get financed but China's export-import bank

03:48.220 --> 03:49.580
doesn't care.

03:49.580 --> 03:53.400
Assuming cooperation between the Chinese and African countries' governments, this bank

03:53.400 --> 03:57.640
will give low-interest or no-interest loans to African countries so they can build these

03:57.640 --> 04:00.380
trains or dams or other projects.

04:00.380 --> 04:04.020
These loans are therefore considered a form of foreign aid since China doesn't expect

04:04.020 --> 04:07.740
to get all their money back, at least adjusted for inflation, since they're not charging

04:07.740 --> 04:10.600
much interest and there's a high risk of default.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.240
Of course, China isn't just financing these projects out of kindness.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.200
For each of them, there's a political goal behind it.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.660
You see, the country of China is running out of growth potential.

04:20.660 --> 04:25.160
Its era of double-digit year-over-year GDP growth is over as it makes the shift from

04:25.160 --> 04:27.600
industrializing to industrialized.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.780
Africa, meanwhile, is one of the least developed areas of the world and a lack of development

04:32.780 --> 04:35.360
actually makes fast growth easy.

04:35.360 --> 04:40.240
The first step of economic development for many countries is natural resource exploitation.

04:40.280 --> 04:44.760
Not only every country has some level of natural resources that can be used to kickstart growth,

04:44.760 --> 04:48.200
but first they need to have enough money to build the infrastructure and take the steps

04:48.200 --> 04:50.760
needed to gather these natural resources.

04:50.760 --> 04:55.240
As everyone knows, it takes money to make money and China has money.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.000
By investing in African mining and farming, China can profit off Africa's growth and

04:59.000 --> 05:03.260
fuel the business back in China that requires minerals and food, but in addition to serving

05:03.260 --> 05:08.260
as a source of natural resources, Africa has another resource—labor.

05:08.260 --> 05:12.440
It might seem strange that China, the country that the world uses for low-cost manufacturing,

05:12.440 --> 05:16.940
is looking for a labor source elsewhere, but that is exactly what it's doing.

05:16.940 --> 05:19.440
China is a victim of its own success.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.360
The economic development that its manufacturing industry brought pushed a large segment of

05:23.360 --> 05:26.900
its population into the middle class which raised labor costs country-wide.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.180
It's not bad news.

05:29.180 --> 05:32.820
China as a country has shifted from having a low-skilled to a medium-skilled workforce

05:32.820 --> 05:37.980
as their education level has improved, but for the lowest-cost, lowest-skilled manufacturing

05:37.980 --> 05:41.140
work, the country of China is no longer competitive.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.860
Therefore, Chinese manufacturing firms are setting up their own operations in Africa—one

05:45.860 --> 05:49.460
of the cheapest and lowest-skilled labor markets in the world.

05:49.460 --> 05:53.580
Today, China is now the largest trading partner with Africa as a whole.

05:53.580 --> 05:58.260
Despite China being a vastly larger country than the US in population, the US and China

05:58.260 --> 06:01.980
both trade a similar value of goods worldwide each year.

06:01.980 --> 06:05.740
In this case, though, whereas $48 billion worth of goods were exchanged between the

06:05.740 --> 06:12.300
US and Africa in 2016, China traded $128 billion worth of goods—nearly three times

06:12.300 --> 06:13.300
as much.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.380
Now, the whole idea of setting up a structure of power over other less-developed states

06:17.380 --> 06:22.060
in order to gather resources and use their labor force might sound familiar because that's

06:22.060 --> 06:24.000
largely what colonialism was.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.940
The motives behind European powers expanding their territory to less-developed nations

06:27.940 --> 06:32.860
in the 15th through 20th centuries were remarkably similar to the motivations between China's

06:32.860 --> 06:36.020
growing economic influence in the developing world today.

06:36.020 --> 06:40.720
Despite what some may say, there is empirical evidence that China has been using these infrastructure

06:40.720 --> 06:43.220
investments to affect worldwide politics.

06:43.220 --> 06:47.860
It's been found that if an African country recognizes Taiwan as a country, they receive,

06:47.860 --> 06:52.900
on average, 2.7 fewer Chinese infrastructure projects within their borders each year.

06:52.900 --> 06:57.660
Conversely, if an African country votes overwhelmingly along with China in the United Nations General

06:57.660 --> 07:02.140
Assembly, they receive 1.8 more infrastructure projects each year.

07:02.140 --> 07:05.740
Considering that the General Assembly is an equal representative body where each country

07:05.740 --> 07:10.080
gets one vote no matter if they have a million residents or a billion, China is getting a

07:10.080 --> 07:14.580
lot of influence for, in the grand scheme of things, not a lot of money.

07:14.580 --> 07:18.620
China touts the fact that their foreign investment and aid is no strings attached.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.300
Unlike other institutions that give low or no interest loans to developing countries

07:22.300 --> 07:26.460
like the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, China gives loans with no requirements

07:26.460 --> 07:29.900
on factors like respect of human rights or democratic elections.

07:29.900 --> 07:33.960
Of course, this data linking infrastructure investment with political leanings shows that

07:33.960 --> 07:38.600
there are indeed hidden strings that require benefit for China rather than benefit for

07:38.600 --> 07:40.260
the receiving country.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.980
Western powers are understandably concerned about this shift in power dynamics towards

07:43.980 --> 07:46.620
a country with vastly different ideals.

07:46.620 --> 07:51.860
In 2017, China entered a select club as it opened a military base in Djibouti.

07:51.860 --> 07:57.500
While four other countries have bases in Djibouti—France, Italy, Japan, and the US—this base was unique

07:57.500 --> 08:02.780
as it was China's first base abroad and those by themselves, military bases abroad,

08:02.780 --> 08:03.780
are unique.

08:03.780 --> 08:08.220
Only 15 of the world's most developed and militarily powerful countries worldwide have

08:08.220 --> 08:10.700
them and now China is one of them.

08:10.700 --> 08:14.480
Although, Western powers might be worried for the wrong reasons.

08:14.480 --> 08:18.780
The government of China is clearly putting a lot of focus and money into Africa but not

08:18.780 --> 08:22.700
as much as you'd think based off the result they're getting—vast amounts of influence

08:22.700 --> 08:24.540
over a whole continent.

08:24.540 --> 08:26.420
There are two key numbers to look at.

08:26.420 --> 08:31.460
In 2015, China loaned just $12 billion to African countries.

08:31.460 --> 08:36.140
In the same year, the country invested a mere $3 billion into the continent.

08:36.140 --> 08:40.460
That's just not much but the reason China is gaining this enormous influence over the

08:40.460 --> 08:45.420
continent is because the Chinese government no longer has to force this phenomenon.

08:45.420 --> 08:48.620
Private Chinese industry is taking hold of Africa.

08:48.620 --> 08:54.380
Of the estimated 10,000 Chinese businesses in Africa, 90% of them are privately owned

08:54.380 --> 08:57.580
rather than one of the numerous Chinese state-run companies.

08:57.580 --> 09:02.120
The Chinese companies in Africa are actually making money, some substantially so.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.860
The Chinese government certainly has provided a considerable push to the industrialization

09:05.860 --> 09:10.700
of Africa but now that that's done, economic forces are pushing the initiative further

09:10.700 --> 09:11.700
forward.

09:11.700 --> 09:14.460
Chinese small business is gripping the continent.

09:14.460 --> 09:18.060
Much of the Western world is ignoring the prospects of the continent—ignoring that

09:18.060 --> 09:22.460
business in Africa can now be as profitable as business in China was when its period of

09:22.460 --> 09:24.180
tremendous growth began.

09:24.180 --> 09:29.320
Right now, Africa is establishing itself as the source of labor and resources for China

09:29.320 --> 09:34.120
and so, until the West pays attention, Africa will continue inching forward on its path

09:34.120 --> 09:36.900
towards becoming China's China.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.680
One of the techniques used to predict the GDP or GDP growth of a country, which is of

09:40.680 --> 09:44.380
course used to decide which country to invest in, is machine learning.

09:44.380 --> 09:47.800
For example, here's what a machine learning model predicted a country's GDP would be

09:47.800 --> 09:50.800
over three months and here's what it actually was.

09:50.800 --> 09:54.240
It forecasted the country's GDP far better than humans did.

09:54.240 --> 09:58.120
The science behind predictions like this is complex but fascinating.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.860
If you want to learn how it works, though, the best place to do so is brilliant.org.

10:02.860 --> 10:07.520
Their machine learning course makes this advanced concept simple because their simple explanations,

10:07.520 --> 10:11.260
illuminating graphics, and thought-provoking questions break a concept down into small

10:11.260 --> 10:14.280
packages and then builds it back up to the final result.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.200
They truly are experts in successfully teaching complex topics.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.360
They also have plenty of other fascinating courses on topics like computational biology,

10:22.360 --> 10:25.560
number theory, artificial neural networks, and more.
