10020	14520	Political alliances manifest themselves here—on the voting floor of the United Nations General
14520	16880	Assembly in New York, New York.
16880	20960	In this room, countries impose legislation that carries weight worldwide and so what
20960	25560	happens in this room is the physical materialization of the world's politics.
25560	30160	47 years ago, exactly that happened when one of the General Assembly's most consequential
30160	31320	votes occurred.
31320	34640	China, you see, essentially has two governments.
34640	39080	There's the Republic of China which used to control the mainland and Taiwan but today
39080	42800	only administers Taiwan and there's the People's Republic of China which controls
42800	43960	the mainland.
43960	48000	Both claim to be the rightful governments of all of the Chinese territory—both Taiwan
48000	52760	and the mainland—and so back in 1971, the United Nations had to decide which government
52760	54360	would represent China.
54360	58520	Essentially, the question was which government was the rightful leader of the territory as
58520	61320	there could only be one in the United Nations.
61320	65600	The US was the main superpower opposing the People's Republic representing China as
65600	69880	it had a strong political and military alliance with the Republic of China government and
69880	74400	so the vote was essentially the US's sphere of influence versus the world.
74400	79180	Among the 35 countries that voted against the People's Republic were much of Africa—the
79180	84280	Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Liberia, Niger, South Africa, and plenty of other
84280	86160	others that sided with the US.
86160	89840	Despite the US's effort, the resolution ended up passing and the representative government
89840	93600	for China in the UN was switched to the People's Republic of China but what's interesting
93600	98640	about this vote is not the result, it's who voted against the People's Republic.
98640	102780	Since that 1971 vote, you see, something has changed.
102780	107960	In 2007, the UN General Assembly met once again to vote on whether to adopt a resolution
107960	110960	condemning the human rights situation in North Korea.
110960	114920	As one of North Korea's strongest allies, this vote was China and its sphere of influence
114920	116520	versus the world.
116520	122760	In this vote, though, only Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia,
122760	126880	Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, and Tanzania voted against China.
126880	132200	All the 43 other African countries either abstained or voted no along with China because
132200	136800	in the 40 years between these votes, political ties changed.
136800	139440	Africa no longer bows to the US.
139440	143340	Much of the continent is now economically and politically aligned with the world's
143340	146200	fastest emerging superpower—China.
146200	150240	The simple answer for why this is is because China has pumped huge amounts of money into
150240	151600	the continent of Africa.
151600	153560	They're buying allies.
153560	158720	For example, China built a $3.2 billion dollar railway in Kenya trekking the 300 miles from
158720	163560	Nairobi, the capital, to Mombasa, the second largest city and primary port, in 4 hours
163560	164560	and 30 minutes.
164560	168800	That's faster than what the fastest train in the US, the Acela Express, takes to travel
168800	171960	the equivalent distance from Philadelphia to Boston.
171960	176700	China also built a $526 million dollar dam in Guinea which helped push the country from
176700	180900	having constant power shortages to making more energy than it needs and selling the
180900	183160	extra capacity to its neighbors.
183160	188640	China also built a $475 million dollar light rail system in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the
188640	192800	first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa, designed as a way to combat the capital's crippling
192800	193800	traffic.
193800	195380	These are only a sampling.
195380	199700	There are literally hundreds of others of Chinese infrastructure projects in Africa
199700	200740	each year.
200740	204940	All across the continent, China is playing a part in projects both big and small that
204940	207140	are transforming African economies.
207140	211180	It's important to note that these projects are not, though, free.
211180	214980	Each of these three were financed by loans granted by China's state-owned and controlled
214980	219160	export-import bank and these loans do, of course, need to be paid back by the countries
219160	220380	granted them.
220380	224220	Large African infrastructure projects, though, would be viewed as risky by any traditional
224220	228220	bank and would therefore struggle to get financed but China's export-import bank
228220	229580	doesn't care.
229580	233400	Assuming cooperation between the Chinese and African countries' governments, this bank
233400	237640	will give low-interest or no-interest loans to African countries so they can build these
237640	240380	trains or dams or other projects.
240380	244020	These loans are therefore considered a form of foreign aid since China doesn't expect
244020	247740	to get all their money back, at least adjusted for inflation, since they're not charging
247740	250600	much interest and there's a high risk of default.
250600	254240	Of course, China isn't just financing these projects out of kindness.
254240	257200	For each of them, there's a political goal behind it.
257200	260660	You see, the country of China is running out of growth potential.
260660	265160	Its era of double-digit year-over-year GDP growth is over as it makes the shift from
265160	267600	industrializing to industrialized.
267600	272780	Africa, meanwhile, is one of the least developed areas of the world and a lack of development
272780	275360	actually makes fast growth easy.
275360	280240	The first step of economic development for many countries is natural resource exploitation.
280280	284760	Not only every country has some level of natural resources that can be used to kickstart growth,
284760	288200	but first they need to have enough money to build the infrastructure and take the steps
288200	290760	needed to gather these natural resources.
290760	295240	As everyone knows, it takes money to make money and China has money.
295240	299000	By investing in African mining and farming, China can profit off Africa's growth and
299000	303260	fuel the business back in China that requires minerals and food, but in addition to serving
303260	308260	as a source of natural resources, Africa has another resource—labor.
308260	312440	It might seem strange that China, the country that the world uses for low-cost manufacturing,
312440	316940	is looking for a labor source elsewhere, but that is exactly what it's doing.
316940	319440	China is a victim of its own success.
319440	323360	The economic development that its manufacturing industry brought pushed a large segment of
323360	326900	its population into the middle class which raised labor costs country-wide.
326900	329180	It's not bad news.
329180	332820	China as a country has shifted from having a low-skilled to a medium-skilled workforce
332820	337980	as their education level has improved, but for the lowest-cost, lowest-skilled manufacturing
337980	341140	work, the country of China is no longer competitive.
341140	345860	Therefore, Chinese manufacturing firms are setting up their own operations in Africa—one
345860	349460	of the cheapest and lowest-skilled labor markets in the world.
349460	353580	Today, China is now the largest trading partner with Africa as a whole.
353580	358260	Despite China being a vastly larger country than the US in population, the US and China
358260	361980	both trade a similar value of goods worldwide each year.
361980	365740	In this case, though, whereas $48 billion worth of goods were exchanged between the
365740	372300	US and Africa in 2016, China traded $128 billion worth of goods—nearly three times
372300	373300	as much.
373300	377380	Now, the whole idea of setting up a structure of power over other less-developed states
377380	382060	in order to gather resources and use their labor force might sound familiar because that's
382060	384000	largely what colonialism was.
384000	387940	The motives behind European powers expanding their territory to less-developed nations
387940	392860	in the 15th through 20th centuries were remarkably similar to the motivations between China's
392860	396020	growing economic influence in the developing world today.
396020	400720	Despite what some may say, there is empirical evidence that China has been using these infrastructure
400720	403220	investments to affect worldwide politics.
403220	407860	It's been found that if an African country recognizes Taiwan as a country, they receive,
407860	412900	on average, 2.7 fewer Chinese infrastructure projects within their borders each year.
412900	417660	Conversely, if an African country votes overwhelmingly along with China in the United Nations General
417660	422140	Assembly, they receive 1.8 more infrastructure projects each year.
422140	425740	Considering that the General Assembly is an equal representative body where each country
425740	430080	gets one vote no matter if they have a million residents or a billion, China is getting a
430080	434580	lot of influence for, in the grand scheme of things, not a lot of money.
434580	438620	China touts the fact that their foreign investment and aid is no strings attached.
438620	442300	Unlike other institutions that give low or no interest loans to developing countries
442300	446460	like the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, China gives loans with no requirements
446460	449900	on factors like respect of human rights or democratic elections.
449900	453960	Of course, this data linking infrastructure investment with political leanings shows that
453960	458600	there are indeed hidden strings that require benefit for China rather than benefit for
458600	460260	the receiving country.
460260	463980	Western powers are understandably concerned about this shift in power dynamics towards
463980	466620	a country with vastly different ideals.
466620	471860	In 2017, China entered a select club as it opened a military base in Djibouti.
471860	477500	While four other countries have bases in Djibouti—France, Italy, Japan, and the US—this base was unique
477500	482780	as it was China's first base abroad and those by themselves, military bases abroad,
482780	483780	are unique.
483780	488220	Only 15 of the world's most developed and militarily powerful countries worldwide have
488220	490700	them and now China is one of them.
490700	494480	Although, Western powers might be worried for the wrong reasons.
494480	498780	The government of China is clearly putting a lot of focus and money into Africa but not
498780	502700	as much as you'd think based off the result they're getting—vast amounts of influence
502700	504540	over a whole continent.
504540	506420	There are two key numbers to look at.
506420	511460	In 2015, China loaned just $12 billion to African countries.
511460	516140	In the same year, the country invested a mere $3 billion into the continent.
516140	520460	That's just not much but the reason China is gaining this enormous influence over the
520460	525420	continent is because the Chinese government no longer has to force this phenomenon.
525420	528620	Private Chinese industry is taking hold of Africa.
528620	534380	Of the estimated 10,000 Chinese businesses in Africa, 90% of them are privately owned
534380	537580	rather than one of the numerous Chinese state-run companies.
537580	542120	The Chinese companies in Africa are actually making money, some substantially so.
542120	545860	The Chinese government certainly has provided a considerable push to the industrialization
545860	550700	of Africa but now that that's done, economic forces are pushing the initiative further
550700	551700	forward.
551700	554460	Chinese small business is gripping the continent.
554460	558060	Much of the Western world is ignoring the prospects of the continent—ignoring that
558060	562460	business in Africa can now be as profitable as business in China was when its period of
562460	564180	tremendous growth began.
564180	569320	Right now, Africa is establishing itself as the source of labor and resources for China
569320	574120	and so, until the West pays attention, Africa will continue inching forward on its path
574120	576900	towards becoming China's China.
576900	580680	One of the techniques used to predict the GDP or GDP growth of a country, which is of
580680	584380	course used to decide which country to invest in, is machine learning.
584380	587800	For example, here's what a machine learning model predicted a country's GDP would be
587800	590800	over three months and here's what it actually was.
590800	594240	It forecasted the country's GDP far better than humans did.
594240	598120	The science behind predictions like this is complex but fascinating.
598120	602860	If you want to learn how it works, though, the best place to do so is brilliant.org.
602860	607520	Their machine learning course makes this advanced concept simple because their simple explanations,
607520	611260	illuminating graphics, and thought-provoking questions break a concept down into small
611260	614280	packages and then builds it back up to the final result.
614280	618200	They truly are experts in successfully teaching complex topics.
618200	622360	They also have plenty of other fascinating courses on topics like computational biology,
622360	625560	number theory, artificial neural networks, and more.
