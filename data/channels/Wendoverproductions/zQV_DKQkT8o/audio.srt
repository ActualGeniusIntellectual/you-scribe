4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,520
Political alliances manifest themselves here—on the voting floor of the United Nations General

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,880
Assembly in New York, New York.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
In this room, countries impose legislation that carries weight worldwide and so what

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,560
happens in this room is the physical materialization of the world's politics.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,160
47 years ago, exactly that happened when one of the General Assembly's most consequential

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,320
votes occurred.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,640
China, you see, essentially has two governments.

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,080
There's the Republic of China which used to control the mainland and Taiwan but today

12
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,800
only administers Taiwan and there's the People's Republic of China which controls

13
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,960
the mainland.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,000
Both claim to be the rightful governments of all of the Chinese territory—both Taiwan

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,760
and the mainland—and so back in 1971, the United Nations had to decide which government

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,360
would represent China.

17
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,520
Essentially, the question was which government was the rightful leader of the territory as

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,320
there could only be one in the United Nations.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,600
The US was the main superpower opposing the People's Republic representing China as

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,880
it had a strong political and military alliance with the Republic of China government and

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,400
so the vote was essentially the US's sphere of influence versus the world.

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,180
Among the 35 countries that voted against the People's Republic were much of Africa—the

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,280
Central African Republic, Chad, Gabon, Liberia, Niger, South Africa, and plenty of other

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,160
others that sided with the US.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,840
Despite the US's effort, the resolution ended up passing and the representative government

26
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
for China in the UN was switched to the People's Republic of China but what's interesting

27
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,640
about this vote is not the result, it's who voted against the People's Republic.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,780
Since that 1971 vote, you see, something has changed.

29
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,960
In 2007, the UN General Assembly met once again to vote on whether to adopt a resolution

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,960
condemning the human rights situation in North Korea.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,920
As one of North Korea's strongest allies, this vote was China and its sphere of influence

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,520
versus the world.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,760
In this vote, though, only Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia,

34
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,880
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, and Tanzania voted against China.

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,200
All the 43 other African countries either abstained or voted no along with China because

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:16,800
in the 40 years between these votes, political ties changed.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,440
Africa no longer bows to the US.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,340
Much of the continent is now economically and politically aligned with the world's

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,200
fastest emerging superpower—China.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,240
The simple answer for why this is is because China has pumped huge amounts of money into

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,600
the continent of Africa.

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,560
They're buying allies.

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,720
For example, China built a $3.2 billion dollar railway in Kenya trekking the 300 miles from

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,560
Nairobi, the capital, to Mombasa, the second largest city and primary port, in 4 hours

45
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,560
and 30 minutes.

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,800
That's faster than what the fastest train in the US, the Acela Express, takes to travel

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,960
the equivalent distance from Philadelphia to Boston.

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,700
China also built a $526 million dollar dam in Guinea which helped push the country from

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,900
having constant power shortages to making more energy than it needs and selling the

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,160
extra capacity to its neighbors.

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,640
China also built a $475 million dollar light rail system in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the

52
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,800
first of its kind in sub-Saharan Africa, designed as a way to combat the capital's crippling

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,800
traffic.

54
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,380
These are only a sampling.

55
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:19,700
There are literally hundreds of others of Chinese infrastructure projects in Africa

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,740
each year.

57
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,940
All across the continent, China is playing a part in projects both big and small that

58
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,140
are transforming African economies.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,180
It's important to note that these projects are not, though, free.

60
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,980
Each of these three were financed by loans granted by China's state-owned and controlled

61
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,160
export-import bank and these loans do, of course, need to be paid back by the countries

62
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,380
granted them.

63
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,220
Large African infrastructure projects, though, would be viewed as risky by any traditional

64
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,220
bank and would therefore struggle to get financed but China's export-import bank

65
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,580
doesn't care.

66
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,400
Assuming cooperation between the Chinese and African countries' governments, this bank

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,640
will give low-interest or no-interest loans to African countries so they can build these

68
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,380
trains or dams or other projects.

69
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,020
These loans are therefore considered a form of foreign aid since China doesn't expect

70
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,740
to get all their money back, at least adjusted for inflation, since they're not charging

71
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,600
much interest and there's a high risk of default.

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,240
Of course, China isn't just financing these projects out of kindness.

73
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,200
For each of them, there's a political goal behind it.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,660
You see, the country of China is running out of growth potential.

75
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,160
Its era of double-digit year-over-year GDP growth is over as it makes the shift from

76
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,600
industrializing to industrialized.

77
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,780
Africa, meanwhile, is one of the least developed areas of the world and a lack of development

78
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,360
actually makes fast growth easy.

79
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
The first step of economic development for many countries is natural resource exploitation.

80
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,760
Not only every country has some level of natural resources that can be used to kickstart growth,

81
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,200
but first they need to have enough money to build the infrastructure and take the steps

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,760
needed to gather these natural resources.

83
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,240
As everyone knows, it takes money to make money and China has money.

84
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,000
By investing in African mining and farming, China can profit off Africa's growth and

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,260
fuel the business back in China that requires minerals and food, but in addition to serving

86
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,260
as a source of natural resources, Africa has another resource—labor.

87
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,440
It might seem strange that China, the country that the world uses for low-cost manufacturing,

88
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,940
is looking for a labor source elsewhere, but that is exactly what it's doing.

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,440
China is a victim of its own success.

90
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,360
The economic development that its manufacturing industry brought pushed a large segment of

91
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,900
its population into the middle class which raised labor costs country-wide.

92
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,180
It's not bad news.

93
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,820
China as a country has shifted from having a low-skilled to a medium-skilled workforce

94
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,980
as their education level has improved, but for the lowest-cost, lowest-skilled manufacturing

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:41,140
work, the country of China is no longer competitive.

96
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,860
Therefore, Chinese manufacturing firms are setting up their own operations in Africa—one

97
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,460
of the cheapest and lowest-skilled labor markets in the world.

98
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:53,580
Today, China is now the largest trading partner with Africa as a whole.

99
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,260
Despite China being a vastly larger country than the US in population, the US and China

100
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,980
both trade a similar value of goods worldwide each year.

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,740
In this case, though, whereas $48 billion worth of goods were exchanged between the

102
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,300
US and Africa in 2016, China traded $128 billion worth of goods—nearly three times

103
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
as much.

104
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,380
Now, the whole idea of setting up a structure of power over other less-developed states

105
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,060
in order to gather resources and use their labor force might sound familiar because that's

106
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,000
largely what colonialism was.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,940
The motives behind European powers expanding their territory to less-developed nations

108
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:32,860
in the 15th through 20th centuries were remarkably similar to the motivations between China's

109
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,020
growing economic influence in the developing world today.

110
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,720
Despite what some may say, there is empirical evidence that China has been using these infrastructure

111
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,220
investments to affect worldwide politics.

112
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,860
It's been found that if an African country recognizes Taiwan as a country, they receive,

113
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,900
on average, 2.7 fewer Chinese infrastructure projects within their borders each year.

114
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,660
Conversely, if an African country votes overwhelmingly along with China in the United Nations General

115
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,140
Assembly, they receive 1.8 more infrastructure projects each year.

116
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,740
Considering that the General Assembly is an equal representative body where each country

117
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,080
gets one vote no matter if they have a million residents or a billion, China is getting a

118
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,580
lot of influence for, in the grand scheme of things, not a lot of money.

119
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,620
China touts the fact that their foreign investment and aid is no strings attached.

120
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,300
Unlike other institutions that give low or no interest loans to developing countries

121
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,460
like the International Monetary Fund or World Bank, China gives loans with no requirements

122
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,900
on factors like respect of human rights or democratic elections.

123
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,960
Of course, this data linking infrastructure investment with political leanings shows that

124
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,600
there are indeed hidden strings that require benefit for China rather than benefit for

125
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,260
the receiving country.

126
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,980
Western powers are understandably concerned about this shift in power dynamics towards

127
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,620
a country with vastly different ideals.

128
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,860
In 2017, China entered a select club as it opened a military base in Djibouti.

129
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,500
While four other countries have bases in Djibouti—France, Italy, Japan, and the US—this base was unique

130
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,780
as it was China's first base abroad and those by themselves, military bases abroad,

131
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,780
are unique.

132
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,220
Only 15 of the world's most developed and militarily powerful countries worldwide have

133
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,700
them and now China is one of them.

134
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,480
Although, Western powers might be worried for the wrong reasons.

135
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,780
The government of China is clearly putting a lot of focus and money into Africa but not

136
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,700
as much as you'd think based off the result they're getting—vast amounts of influence

137
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,540
over a whole continent.

138
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,420
There are two key numbers to look at.

139
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,460
In 2015, China loaned just $12 billion to African countries.

140
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,140
In the same year, the country invested a mere $3 billion into the continent.

141
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,460
That's just not much but the reason China is gaining this enormous influence over the

142
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,420
continent is because the Chinese government no longer has to force this phenomenon.

143
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,620
Private Chinese industry is taking hold of Africa.

144
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:54,380
Of the estimated 10,000 Chinese businesses in Africa, 90% of them are privately owned

145
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,580
rather than one of the numerous Chinese state-run companies.

146
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,120
The Chinese companies in Africa are actually making money, some substantially so.

147
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,860
The Chinese government certainly has provided a considerable push to the industrialization

148
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,700
of Africa but now that that's done, economic forces are pushing the initiative further

149
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
forward.

150
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,460
Chinese small business is gripping the continent.

151
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,060
Much of the Western world is ignoring the prospects of the continent—ignoring that

152
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:22,460
business in Africa can now be as profitable as business in China was when its period of

153
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,180
tremendous growth began.

154
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,320
Right now, Africa is establishing itself as the source of labor and resources for China

155
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,120
and so, until the West pays attention, Africa will continue inching forward on its path

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,900
towards becoming China's China.

157
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,680
One of the techniques used to predict the GDP or GDP growth of a country, which is of

158
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,380
course used to decide which country to invest in, is machine learning.

159
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,800
For example, here's what a machine learning model predicted a country's GDP would be

160
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
over three months and here's what it actually was.

161
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
It forecasted the country's GDP far better than humans did.

162
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,120
The science behind predictions like this is complex but fascinating.

163
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,860
