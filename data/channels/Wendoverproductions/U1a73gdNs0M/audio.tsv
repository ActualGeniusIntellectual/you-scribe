9980	14460	A quite reasonable question would be why the American government is paying United Airlines
14460	22100	$4,780,955 a year to fly from their hub in Newark to the small northern main town of
22100	23100	Presque Isle.
23100	30580	The question could also be asked for why they pay Boutique Air $3,328,207 a year to fly
30580	35140	from Dallas and Houston to the small Texan city of Victoria, or why United Airlines is
35140	40700	paid $2,317,073 a year to fly from Denver to Pueblo, Colorado.
40700	45160	Well, these are subsidies, and in some cases, quite hefty ones.
45160	47740	Take that flight from Houston to Victoria, Texas.
47740	52580	Boutique will sell one of their seats on their small prop plane for as low as $54 on this
52580	53580	route.
53580	59260	The government, however, will chip in an additional $380 per passenger through this subsidy.
59260	65860	For Denver to Pueblo, Colorado, United sells tickets for $86 but then pockets $282 from
65860	67060	the government.
67060	71380	Each of these routes and hundreds more around the US are part of a little-known US government
71380	74440	program called the Essential Air Service.
74440	79180	The premise of the program is simple—for the most part, and of course there are exceptions,
79180	83540	flying to small towns is not profitable for commercial airlines.
83540	84980	This makes sense.
84980	89300	When operating an airline, there are a number of fixed costs for every flight operated.
89300	93500	No matter if an aircraft seats six passengers or 600, an airline is going to need to have
93500	99420	check-in agents, baggage handlers, gate agents, pilots, dispatchers, sales agents, and more.
99420	103540	Since those fixed costs are distributed between fewer passengers with smaller planes, the
103540	108100	cost to operate per passenger tends to get higher when you get down to the smallest sizes
108100	109220	of planes.
109220	113400	Of course, airlines could compensate for this by raising fares on these routes, but like
113400	119660	many countries, the US has a significant economic divide between its rural and urban parts.
119660	124220	In general, the more populated a place is, the wealthier its inhabitants are.
124220	128420	So, say there's a city of one million and a town of 10,000.
128420	132020	Barring any other variables, you would expect the demand for flights in the city of one
132020	137080	million to be about 100 times greater than in the town of 10,000 since its population
137080	142140	is 100 times greater, but when you add the real-world variable of income, knowing that
142140	146940	those in the town of 10,000 earn less, demand would go down for flights from the town since
146940	149480	its inhabitants are less able to pay.
149480	154920	Therefore, considering income, you might expect to have 150 times more demand from the city
154920	157980	even though its population is only 100 times greater.
157980	161600	When you then add the variable of price, given that tickets average more expensive from smaller
161600	167060	towns, that would further reduce their demand so now, a city might have 200 times more demand
167060	170140	despite having only 100 times higher population.
170140	174020	Of course, airlines need demand to make a route viable.
174020	178620	Even if they're only flying a tiny plane to that 10,000 person town daily, they still
178620	181800	need seats filled to make it commercially successful.
181800	186780	As we've just demonstrated, demand decreases exponentially the smaller a town gets so the
186780	190640	number of small towns that would actually prove to be commercially viable to airlines
190640	192460	in the US is small.
192460	194820	That's not to say they don't exist, though.
194820	199620	For example, let's look at Colorado's 13 commercial airports—Grand Junction, Cortez,
199620	205660	Durango, Telluride, Montrose, Gunnison, Aspen, Hayden, Eagle County, Alamosa, Pueblo, Colorado
205660	207260	Springs, and Denver.
207260	212440	Of these, clearly Denver and Colorado Springs, as cities, are not going to be subsidized,
212440	216620	but then the remaining 11 airports are all in fairly small towns.
216620	222380	However, of these 11, only the service to Cortez, Alamosa, and Pueblo are subsidized
222380	224420	with the Essential Air Service program.
224420	228980	Now, this is interesting, considering that Gunnison has a smaller population than Cortez,
228980	232660	Hayden has a smaller population than Alamosa, and Grand Junction has a smaller population
232660	233660	than Pueblo.
233660	237400	The difference between these three subsidized airports and the other small ones is that
237400	243020	these are all in the mountains—Cortez, Alamosa, and Pueblo are not.
243020	246940	That means that all these other airports are near ski resorts and therefore have strong
246940	249060	inbound demand from tourists.
249060	253260	This is the major circumstance when service to small towns is commercially viable alone—when
253260	257360	it serves tourist hotspots—but in other cases, it's just extremely rare for these
257360	260940	types of routes to make enough money for it to be worth it to airlines.
260940	266020	So, very simply, the idea of the Essential Air Service program is to close the gap between
266020	269620	what it takes for a route to be worth it to an airline and how much they'll earn from
269620	271480	operating to a small city.
271480	275460	Through a bidding process, airlines will be granted the contract to operate these routes,
275460	280140	getting paid anywhere from $144,000 a year—as in the case of Mokulele Airlines' service
280140	284840	from Kailui to Hana, Hawaii—up to $4.7 million a year—as in the case of United
284840	287420	Service from Newark to Presque Isle, Maine.
287420	291740	Now, airlines are paid per flight operated, not per passenger, which means that they will
291740	296620	happily and regularly operate flights with just a couple, or no, passengers.
296620	301460	Plenty of airlines running EAS routes would be profitable without selling a single ticket,
301460	305340	solely through the government's payment, so a whole industry has arisen around servicing
305340	306340	these routes.
306420	311020	While the large airlines like United, Delta, and American do bid and operate these routes,
311020	315180	the smallest plane they each operate is a 50-seat CRJ-200.
315180	319560	Plenty of these routes have far less demand than that, even if there's just one daily
319560	320560	flight.
320560	323100	That's why smaller airlines have evolved.
323100	325300	Take the example of Air Choice One.
325300	329500	They're a tiny airline operating a dozen Cessna Grand Caravans from Minneapolis to
329500	334540	Ironwood, Mason City, and Fort Dodge, Chicago to Ironwood, Mason City, and Burlington, Mason
334540	338820	City to Fort Dodge and Burlington, St. Louis to Burlington, Fort Dodge, Jonesborough,
338820	341860	and Jackson, and then finally Atlanta to Jackson.
341860	347360	Of Air Choice One's 13 routes, every single one is subsidized by the Essential Air Service.
347360	353060	The airline earns $15.7 million in revenue yearly through this before actual ticket sales.
353060	357180	These sorts of small regional airlines, of which there are dozens in the US, would likely
357180	361540	not exist without the Essential Air Service program as the type of flying they do would
361540	363860	certainly not be profitable.
363860	368100	Worth mentioning is that a system of subsidies for routes to small towns is not unique to
368100	369100	the US.
369100	373200	In Europe, they're known as Public Service Obligation Routes, or PSOs.
373200	377060	This system is a little more complicated than the US is with varying terms for when and
377060	382320	how airlines get paid, but the amount of compensation varies quite a bit more than in the US.
382320	388620	For example, in the UK, the effective per-passenger subsidy ranges all the way from $4.57 for
388620	393640	Flybe's route from London Heathrow to Newquay up to, apparently, more than $1,000 per passenger
393640	396720	in the case of Airtask's routes in the Shetland Islands.
396720	401000	The US, though, has more federally subsidized routes than the entirety of the European Union
401000	405920	because, after all, the geography of the US is quite different.
405920	409680	The US is one of the least dense developed countries in the world.
409680	414220	If the population of the US lived as densely as that of the UK, it would fit comfortably
414220	417940	in just California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.
417940	421560	Given this spread, it does have an issue with transport.
421560	426920	The rural areas of the US are just hard to get to and from, and this can make a bad economic
426920	428320	situation worse.
428320	433480	As just one example, companies can and have made the decision to move their operations,
433480	437520	whether factories or headquarters, from smaller towns to bigger ones in order to be closer
437520	439260	to large airports.
439260	443840	Outside the US, transport to rural areas is often provided by train and, while part of
443840	448180	the reason for the US's minimal development of passenger railroads is lack of interest,
448180	452700	it would also be tough, in many places, to build a financially viable passenger railroad
452700	454980	due to the country's vastness.
454980	459780	Without these flights, the only public transportation in or out of much of rural America would be
459780	461980	the bus, at best.
461980	465000	In the lower 48, this program helps communities.
465000	469900	In Alaska, though, there are plenty of communities that quite literally would not exist without
469900	470900	these subsidies.
470900	476220	65 of the US's 179 EAS routes are within the state of Alaska.
476220	481020	A big reason for that is that only 14% of Alaska's municipalities are connected to
481020	482820	the outside world by road.
482820	488100	The state is just so vast and harsh that building roads to most of these areas wouldn't make
488100	489100	sense.
489100	493940	In place of roads, Alaska's rural towns have airports, meaning that, in many cases,
493940	498420	their essential air service subsidized flights are the only ways in or out.
498420	503480	So, the way the essential air service works is clear, but is it effective at its goal
503480	506880	of elevating the economy of rural areas of America?
506880	511880	Well, according to one of the most comprehensive studies done on the matter in recent years,
511880	516700	every 1% increase in passenger traffic at a subsidized airport leads to the per capita
516700	520320	income of that community increasing by 0.12%.
520320	525120	It's tough to know exactly how much of a passenger number increase the program leads
525120	529880	to, but this at least serves as evidence that the underlying supposition of the program,
529880	532840	that air service leads to economic opportunity, is true.
532880	537440	What's also true, though, is that the essential air service program is not as efficient as
537440	538440	it could be.
538440	543320	For example, for the longest time, Southern Airways Express has been getting $2.3 million
543320	546880	a year to fly from Hagerstown, Maryland to Pittsburgh and Baltimore.
546880	552760	That's despite the fact that BWI Airport is just 67 miles or 108 kilometers away from
552760	553800	Hagerstown.
553800	557880	In the air, the flight takes about 30 to 40 minutes, given the slow speed of the Cessna
557880	559320	Grand Caravan.
559320	563800	Traveling between the two airports takes about 70 to 80 minutes and, for anyone without a
563800	567680	car, there are commercial airport shuttles operating between Hagerstown and BWI.
567680	573360	What's more, Hagerstown is also an hour's drive from DC's National and Dulles Airports,
573360	578840	and Hagerstown Airport even has regular, non-EAS subsidized routes to Myrtle Beach, Orlando,
578840	579840	and Tampa.
579840	584260	It's safe to say that a town like Hagerstown is benefiting far less from its multi-million
584260	586960	dollar subsidy than a town like Adak, Alaska.
586960	592820	That's why, in late October 2019, Hagerstown got the axe—it will no longer be subsidized
592820	595420	by the Essential Air Service program.
595420	599060	Under increased scrutiny, the requirements for this program have gotten stricter and
599060	601120	stricter in recent years.
601120	606340	Nowadays, to be eligible, a community has to be more than 70 miles or 110 kilometers
606340	610680	from the nearest major airport, has to cost the government less than $200 per passenger
610680	615320	if it's within 210 miles or 340 kilometers of the nearest major airport, and has to average
615320	620280	more than 10 passengers per day unless it's further than 175 miles or 280 kilometers from
620280	622160	the nearest major airport.
622160	626480	With these requirements, more and more communities are losing their funding.
626480	628680	Some of these are clearly justified.
628680	632840	While flights might be nice, nobody's losing out on opportunity by having to drive or take
632840	635860	the bus an hour from Hagerstown to BWI.
635860	640080	There is and long has been, though, talk of completely eliminating the program.
640080	644220	Now, without telling you what to think, I'm just going to present some numbers.
644220	649760	It costs the US government about $290 million a year to run the Essential Air Service—a
649760	652600	program that connects hundreds of communities to the outside world.
652600	656780	For that same amount of money, the government could build about 40 miles or 65 kilometers
656780	660800	of highway, it could pay to maintain all of the US government's empty or disused buildings
660800	665580	for 62 days, or it could buy one-seventh of a B-2 Spirit bomber.
665580	672160	In government terms, $290 million just isn't that much.
672160	676040	Some exciting news—I've just gotten back from filming a documentary about something,
676040	677040	somewhere.
677040	679640	That's all the info you get, aside from that it's actually good and that it's
679640	683040	a Nebula original, meaning that to watch it when it comes out at the end of November,
683040	686800	you'll have to head to Nebula—the streaming site built by myself and a bunch of other
686800	687800	creators.
687800	691620	To make that easier, though, Nebula has partnered with CuriosityStream—the streaming site
691620	695760	home to thousands of top-quality documentaries and non-fiction TV shows.
695760	698440	CuriosityStream is worth signing up for by itself.
698440	701960	Beyond just its great library, it's available pretty much everywhere for a very reasonable
701960	704000	cost of just $3 a month.
704000	708700	That $3 a month CuriosityStream membership, though, now also gets you access to Nebula
708700	711680	if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
711680	716520	That's really an amazing deal for two top-quality streaming sites and, the best part is, you'll
716520	720440	be supporting myself and so many other independent creators while you do it.
