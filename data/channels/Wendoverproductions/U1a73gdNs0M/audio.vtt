00:09.980 --> 00:14.460
A quite reasonable question would be why the American government is paying United Airlines

00:14.460 --> 00:22.100
$4,780,955 a year to fly from their hub in Newark to the small northern main town of

00:22.100 --> 00:23.100
Presque Isle.

00:23.100 --> 00:30.580
The question could also be asked for why they pay Boutique Air $3,328,207 a year to fly

00:30.580 --> 00:35.140
from Dallas and Houston to the small Texan city of Victoria, or why United Airlines is

00:35.140 --> 00:40.700
paid $2,317,073 a year to fly from Denver to Pueblo, Colorado.

00:40.700 --> 00:45.160
Well, these are subsidies, and in some cases, quite hefty ones.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.740
Take that flight from Houston to Victoria, Texas.

00:47.740 --> 00:52.580
Boutique will sell one of their seats on their small prop plane for as low as $54 on this

00:52.580 --> 00:53.580
route.

00:53.580 --> 00:59.260
The government, however, will chip in an additional $380 per passenger through this subsidy.

00:59.260 --> 01:05.860
For Denver to Pueblo, Colorado, United sells tickets for $86 but then pockets $282 from

01:05.860 --> 01:07.060
the government.

01:07.060 --> 01:11.380
Each of these routes and hundreds more around the US are part of a little-known US government

01:11.380 --> 01:14.440
program called the Essential Air Service.

01:14.440 --> 01:19.180
The premise of the program is simple—for the most part, and of course there are exceptions,

01:19.180 --> 01:23.540
flying to small towns is not profitable for commercial airlines.

01:23.540 --> 01:24.980
This makes sense.

01:24.980 --> 01:29.300
When operating an airline, there are a number of fixed costs for every flight operated.

01:29.300 --> 01:33.500
No matter if an aircraft seats six passengers or 600, an airline is going to need to have

01:33.500 --> 01:39.420
check-in agents, baggage handlers, gate agents, pilots, dispatchers, sales agents, and more.

01:39.420 --> 01:43.540
Since those fixed costs are distributed between fewer passengers with smaller planes, the

01:43.540 --> 01:48.100
cost to operate per passenger tends to get higher when you get down to the smallest sizes

01:48.100 --> 01:49.220
of planes.

01:49.220 --> 01:53.400
Of course, airlines could compensate for this by raising fares on these routes, but like

01:53.400 --> 01:59.660
many countries, the US has a significant economic divide between its rural and urban parts.

01:59.660 --> 02:04.220
In general, the more populated a place is, the wealthier its inhabitants are.

02:04.220 --> 02:08.420
So, say there's a city of one million and a town of 10,000.

02:08.420 --> 02:12.020
Barring any other variables, you would expect the demand for flights in the city of one

02:12.020 --> 02:17.080
million to be about 100 times greater than in the town of 10,000 since its population

02:17.080 --> 02:22.140
is 100 times greater, but when you add the real-world variable of income, knowing that

02:22.140 --> 02:26.940
those in the town of 10,000 earn less, demand would go down for flights from the town since

02:26.940 --> 02:29.480
its inhabitants are less able to pay.

02:29.480 --> 02:34.920
Therefore, considering income, you might expect to have 150 times more demand from the city

02:34.920 --> 02:37.980
even though its population is only 100 times greater.

02:37.980 --> 02:41.600
When you then add the variable of price, given that tickets average more expensive from smaller

02:41.600 --> 02:47.060
towns, that would further reduce their demand so now, a city might have 200 times more demand

02:47.060 --> 02:50.140
despite having only 100 times higher population.

02:50.140 --> 02:54.020
Of course, airlines need demand to make a route viable.

02:54.020 --> 02:58.620
Even if they're only flying a tiny plane to that 10,000 person town daily, they still

02:58.620 --> 03:01.800
need seats filled to make it commercially successful.

03:01.800 --> 03:06.780
As we've just demonstrated, demand decreases exponentially the smaller a town gets so the

03:06.780 --> 03:10.640
number of small towns that would actually prove to be commercially viable to airlines

03:10.640 --> 03:12.460
in the US is small.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.820
That's not to say they don't exist, though.

03:14.820 --> 03:19.620
For example, let's look at Colorado's 13 commercial airports—Grand Junction, Cortez,

03:19.620 --> 03:25.660
Durango, Telluride, Montrose, Gunnison, Aspen, Hayden, Eagle County, Alamosa, Pueblo, Colorado

03:25.660 --> 03:27.260
Springs, and Denver.

03:27.260 --> 03:32.440
Of these, clearly Denver and Colorado Springs, as cities, are not going to be subsidized,

03:32.440 --> 03:36.620
but then the remaining 11 airports are all in fairly small towns.

03:36.620 --> 03:42.380
However, of these 11, only the service to Cortez, Alamosa, and Pueblo are subsidized

03:42.380 --> 03:44.420
with the Essential Air Service program.

03:44.420 --> 03:48.980
Now, this is interesting, considering that Gunnison has a smaller population than Cortez,

03:48.980 --> 03:52.660
Hayden has a smaller population than Alamosa, and Grand Junction has a smaller population

03:52.660 --> 03:53.660
than Pueblo.

03:53.660 --> 03:57.400
The difference between these three subsidized airports and the other small ones is that

03:57.400 --> 04:03.020
these are all in the mountains—Cortez, Alamosa, and Pueblo are not.

04:03.020 --> 04:06.940
That means that all these other airports are near ski resorts and therefore have strong

04:06.940 --> 04:09.060
inbound demand from tourists.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.260
This is the major circumstance when service to small towns is commercially viable alone—when

04:13.260 --> 04:17.360
it serves tourist hotspots—but in other cases, it's just extremely rare for these

04:17.360 --> 04:20.940
types of routes to make enough money for it to be worth it to airlines.

04:20.940 --> 04:26.020
So, very simply, the idea of the Essential Air Service program is to close the gap between

04:26.020 --> 04:29.620
what it takes for a route to be worth it to an airline and how much they'll earn from

04:29.620 --> 04:31.480
operating to a small city.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.460
Through a bidding process, airlines will be granted the contract to operate these routes,

04:35.460 --> 04:40.140
getting paid anywhere from $144,000 a year—as in the case of Mokulele Airlines' service

04:40.140 --> 04:44.840
from Kailui to Hana, Hawaii—up to $4.7 million a year—as in the case of United

04:44.840 --> 04:47.420
Service from Newark to Presque Isle, Maine.

04:47.420 --> 04:51.740
Now, airlines are paid per flight operated, not per passenger, which means that they will

04:51.740 --> 04:56.620
happily and regularly operate flights with just a couple, or no, passengers.

04:56.620 --> 05:01.460
Plenty of airlines running EAS routes would be profitable without selling a single ticket,

05:01.460 --> 05:05.340
solely through the government's payment, so a whole industry has arisen around servicing

05:05.340 --> 05:06.340
these routes.

05:06.420 --> 05:11.020
While the large airlines like United, Delta, and American do bid and operate these routes,

05:11.020 --> 05:15.180
the smallest plane they each operate is a 50-seat CRJ-200.

05:15.180 --> 05:19.560
Plenty of these routes have far less demand than that, even if there's just one daily

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
flight.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.100
That's why smaller airlines have evolved.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.300
Take the example of Air Choice One.

05:25.300 --> 05:29.500
They're a tiny airline operating a dozen Cessna Grand Caravans from Minneapolis to

05:29.500 --> 05:34.540
Ironwood, Mason City, and Fort Dodge, Chicago to Ironwood, Mason City, and Burlington, Mason

05:34.540 --> 05:38.820
City to Fort Dodge and Burlington, St. Louis to Burlington, Fort Dodge, Jonesborough,

05:38.820 --> 05:41.860
and Jackson, and then finally Atlanta to Jackson.

05:41.860 --> 05:47.360
Of Air Choice One's 13 routes, every single one is subsidized by the Essential Air Service.

05:47.360 --> 05:53.060
The airline earns $15.7 million in revenue yearly through this before actual ticket sales.

05:53.060 --> 05:57.180
These sorts of small regional airlines, of which there are dozens in the US, would likely

05:57.180 --> 06:01.540
not exist without the Essential Air Service program as the type of flying they do would

06:01.540 --> 06:03.860
certainly not be profitable.

06:03.860 --> 06:08.100
Worth mentioning is that a system of subsidies for routes to small towns is not unique to

06:08.100 --> 06:09.100
the US.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.200
In Europe, they're known as Public Service Obligation Routes, or PSOs.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.060
This system is a little more complicated than the US is with varying terms for when and

06:17.060 --> 06:22.320
how airlines get paid, but the amount of compensation varies quite a bit more than in the US.

06:22.320 --> 06:28.620
For example, in the UK, the effective per-passenger subsidy ranges all the way from $4.57 for

06:28.620 --> 06:33.640
Flybe's route from London Heathrow to Newquay up to, apparently, more than $1,000 per passenger

06:33.640 --> 06:36.720
in the case of Airtask's routes in the Shetland Islands.

06:36.720 --> 06:41.000
The US, though, has more federally subsidized routes than the entirety of the European Union

06:41.000 --> 06:45.920
because, after all, the geography of the US is quite different.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.680
The US is one of the least dense developed countries in the world.

06:49.680 --> 06:54.220
If the population of the US lived as densely as that of the UK, it would fit comfortably

06:54.220 --> 06:57.940
in just California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.

06:57.940 --> 07:01.560
Given this spread, it does have an issue with transport.

07:01.560 --> 07:06.920
The rural areas of the US are just hard to get to and from, and this can make a bad economic

07:06.920 --> 07:08.320
situation worse.

07:08.320 --> 07:13.480
As just one example, companies can and have made the decision to move their operations,

07:13.480 --> 07:17.520
whether factories or headquarters, from smaller towns to bigger ones in order to be closer

07:17.520 --> 07:19.260
to large airports.

07:19.260 --> 07:23.840
Outside the US, transport to rural areas is often provided by train and, while part of

07:23.840 --> 07:28.180
the reason for the US's minimal development of passenger railroads is lack of interest,

07:28.180 --> 07:32.700
it would also be tough, in many places, to build a financially viable passenger railroad

07:32.700 --> 07:34.980
due to the country's vastness.

07:34.980 --> 07:39.780
Without these flights, the only public transportation in or out of much of rural America would be

07:39.780 --> 07:41.980
the bus, at best.

07:41.980 --> 07:45.000
In the lower 48, this program helps communities.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.900
In Alaska, though, there are plenty of communities that quite literally would not exist without

07:49.900 --> 07:50.900
these subsidies.

07:50.900 --> 07:56.220
65 of the US's 179 EAS routes are within the state of Alaska.

07:56.220 --> 08:01.020
A big reason for that is that only 14% of Alaska's municipalities are connected to

08:01.020 --> 08:02.820
the outside world by road.

08:02.820 --> 08:08.100
The state is just so vast and harsh that building roads to most of these areas wouldn't make

08:08.100 --> 08:09.100
sense.

08:09.100 --> 08:13.940
In place of roads, Alaska's rural towns have airports, meaning that, in many cases,

08:13.940 --> 08:18.420
their essential air service subsidized flights are the only ways in or out.

08:18.420 --> 08:23.480
So, the way the essential air service works is clear, but is it effective at its goal

08:23.480 --> 08:26.880
of elevating the economy of rural areas of America?

08:26.880 --> 08:31.880
Well, according to one of the most comprehensive studies done on the matter in recent years,

08:31.880 --> 08:36.700
every 1% increase in passenger traffic at a subsidized airport leads to the per capita

08:36.700 --> 08:40.320
income of that community increasing by 0.12%.

08:40.320 --> 08:45.120
It's tough to know exactly how much of a passenger number increase the program leads

08:45.120 --> 08:49.880
to, but this at least serves as evidence that the underlying supposition of the program,

08:49.880 --> 08:52.840
that air service leads to economic opportunity, is true.

08:52.880 --> 08:57.440
What's also true, though, is that the essential air service program is not as efficient as

08:57.440 --> 08:58.440
it could be.

08:58.440 --> 09:03.320
For example, for the longest time, Southern Airways Express has been getting $2.3 million

09:03.320 --> 09:06.880
a year to fly from Hagerstown, Maryland to Pittsburgh and Baltimore.

09:06.880 --> 09:12.760
That's despite the fact that BWI Airport is just 67 miles or 108 kilometers away from

09:12.760 --> 09:13.800
Hagerstown.

09:13.800 --> 09:17.880
In the air, the flight takes about 30 to 40 minutes, given the slow speed of the Cessna

09:17.880 --> 09:19.320
Grand Caravan.

09:19.320 --> 09:23.800
Traveling between the two airports takes about 70 to 80 minutes and, for anyone without a

09:23.800 --> 09:27.680
car, there are commercial airport shuttles operating between Hagerstown and BWI.

09:27.680 --> 09:33.360
What's more, Hagerstown is also an hour's drive from DC's National and Dulles Airports,

09:33.360 --> 09:38.840
and Hagerstown Airport even has regular, non-EAS subsidized routes to Myrtle Beach, Orlando,

09:38.840 --> 09:39.840
and Tampa.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.260
It's safe to say that a town like Hagerstown is benefiting far less from its multi-million

09:44.260 --> 09:46.960
dollar subsidy than a town like Adak, Alaska.

09:46.960 --> 09:52.820
That's why, in late October 2019, Hagerstown got the axe—it will no longer be subsidized

09:52.820 --> 09:55.420
by the Essential Air Service program.

09:55.420 --> 09:59.060
Under increased scrutiny, the requirements for this program have gotten stricter and

09:59.060 --> 10:01.120
stricter in recent years.

10:01.120 --> 10:06.340
Nowadays, to be eligible, a community has to be more than 70 miles or 110 kilometers

10:06.340 --> 10:10.680
from the nearest major airport, has to cost the government less than $200 per passenger

10:10.680 --> 10:15.320
if it's within 210 miles or 340 kilometers of the nearest major airport, and has to average

10:15.320 --> 10:20.280
more than 10 passengers per day unless it's further than 175 miles or 280 kilometers from

10:20.280 --> 10:22.160
the nearest major airport.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.480
With these requirements, more and more communities are losing their funding.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.680
Some of these are clearly justified.

10:28.680 --> 10:32.840
While flights might be nice, nobody's losing out on opportunity by having to drive or take

10:32.840 --> 10:35.860
the bus an hour from Hagerstown to BWI.

10:35.860 --> 10:40.080
There is and long has been, though, talk of completely eliminating the program.

10:40.080 --> 10:44.220
Now, without telling you what to think, I'm just going to present some numbers.

10:44.220 --> 10:49.760
It costs the US government about $290 million a year to run the Essential Air Service—a

10:49.760 --> 10:52.600
program that connects hundreds of communities to the outside world.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.780
For that same amount of money, the government could build about 40 miles or 65 kilometers

10:56.780 --> 11:00.800
of highway, it could pay to maintain all of the US government's empty or disused buildings

11:00.800 --> 11:05.580
for 62 days, or it could buy one-seventh of a B-2 Spirit bomber.

11:05.580 --> 11:12.160
In government terms, $290 million just isn't that much.

11:12.160 --> 11:16.040
Some exciting news—I've just gotten back from filming a documentary about something,

11:16.040 --> 11:17.040
somewhere.

11:17.040 --> 11:19.640
That's all the info you get, aside from that it's actually good and that it's

11:19.640 --> 11:23.040
a Nebula original, meaning that to watch it when it comes out at the end of November,

11:23.040 --> 11:26.800
you'll have to head to Nebula—the streaming site built by myself and a bunch of other

11:26.800 --> 11:27.800
creators.

11:27.800 --> 11:31.620
To make that easier, though, Nebula has partnered with CuriosityStream—the streaming site

11:31.620 --> 11:35.760
home to thousands of top-quality documentaries and non-fiction TV shows.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.440
CuriosityStream is worth signing up for by itself.

11:38.440 --> 11:41.960
Beyond just its great library, it's available pretty much everywhere for a very reasonable

11:41.960 --> 11:44.000
cost of just $3 a month.

11:44.000 --> 11:48.700
That $3 a month CuriosityStream membership, though, now also gets you access to Nebula

11:48.700 --> 11:51.680
if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

11:51.680 --> 11:56.520
That's really an amazing deal for two top-quality streaming sites and, the best part is, you'll

11:56.520 --> 12:00.440
be supporting myself and so many other independent creators while you do it.
