4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,460
A quite reasonable question would be why the American government is paying United Airlines

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,100
$4,780,955 a year to fly from their hub in Newark to the small northern main town of

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
Presque Isle.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,580
The question could also be asked for why they pay Boutique Air $3,328,207 a year to fly

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,140
from Dallas and Houston to the small Texan city of Victoria, or why United Airlines is

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,700
paid $2,317,073 a year to fly from Denver to Pueblo, Colorado.

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,160
Well, these are subsidies, and in some cases, quite hefty ones.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,740
Take that flight from Houston to Victoria, Texas.

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,580
Boutique will sell one of their seats on their small prop plane for as low as $54 on this

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,580
route.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,260
The government, however, will chip in an additional $380 per passenger through this subsidy.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,860
For Denver to Pueblo, Colorado, United sells tickets for $86 but then pockets $282 from

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,060
the government.

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,380
Each of these routes and hundreds more around the US are part of a little-known US government

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,440
program called the Essential Air Service.

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:19,180
The premise of the program is simple—for the most part, and of course there are exceptions,

20
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:23,540
flying to small towns is not profitable for commercial airlines.

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,980
This makes sense.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,300
When operating an airline, there are a number of fixed costs for every flight operated.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,500
No matter if an aircraft seats six passengers or 600, an airline is going to need to have

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:39,420
check-in agents, baggage handlers, gate agents, pilots, dispatchers, sales agents, and more.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,540
Since those fixed costs are distributed between fewer passengers with smaller planes, the

26
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,100
cost to operate per passenger tends to get higher when you get down to the smallest sizes

27
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,220
of planes.

28
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,400
Of course, airlines could compensate for this by raising fares on these routes, but like

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,660
many countries, the US has a significant economic divide between its rural and urban parts.

30
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,220
In general, the more populated a place is, the wealthier its inhabitants are.

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,420
So, say there's a city of one million and a town of 10,000.

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,020
Barring any other variables, you would expect the demand for flights in the city of one

33
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,080
million to be about 100 times greater than in the town of 10,000 since its population

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,140
is 100 times greater, but when you add the real-world variable of income, knowing that

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,940
those in the town of 10,000 earn less, demand would go down for flights from the town since

36
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,480
its inhabitants are less able to pay.

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,920
Therefore, considering income, you might expect to have 150 times more demand from the city

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,980
even though its population is only 100 times greater.

39
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,600
When you then add the variable of price, given that tickets average more expensive from smaller

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,060
towns, that would further reduce their demand so now, a city might have 200 times more demand

41
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,140
despite having only 100 times higher population.

42
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,020
Of course, airlines need demand to make a route viable.

43
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,620
Even if they're only flying a tiny plane to that 10,000 person town daily, they still

44
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,800
need seats filled to make it commercially successful.

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,780
As we've just demonstrated, demand decreases exponentially the smaller a town gets so the

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,640
number of small towns that would actually prove to be commercially viable to airlines

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,460
in the US is small.

48
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,820
That's not to say they don't exist, though.

49
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:19,620
For example, let's look at Colorado's 13 commercial airports—Grand Junction, Cortez,

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,660
Durango, Telluride, Montrose, Gunnison, Aspen, Hayden, Eagle County, Alamosa, Pueblo, Colorado

51
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,260
Springs, and Denver.

52
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,440
Of these, clearly Denver and Colorado Springs, as cities, are not going to be subsidized,

53
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,620
but then the remaining 11 airports are all in fairly small towns.

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,380
However, of these 11, only the service to Cortez, Alamosa, and Pueblo are subsidized

55
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,420
with the Essential Air Service program.

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,980
Now, this is interesting, considering that Gunnison has a smaller population than Cortez,

57
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,660
Hayden has a smaller population than Alamosa, and Grand Junction has a smaller population

58
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,660
than Pueblo.

59
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,400
The difference between these three subsidized airports and the other small ones is that

60
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,020
these are all in the mountains—Cortez, Alamosa, and Pueblo are not.

61
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,940
That means that all these other airports are near ski resorts and therefore have strong

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,060
inbound demand from tourists.

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,260
This is the major circumstance when service to small towns is commercially viable alone—when

64
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,360
it serves tourist hotspots—but in other cases, it's just extremely rare for these

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,940
types of routes to make enough money for it to be worth it to airlines.

66
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,020
So, very simply, the idea of the Essential Air Service program is to close the gap between

67
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,620
what it takes for a route to be worth it to an airline and how much they'll earn from

68
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,480
operating to a small city.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,460
Through a bidding process, airlines will be granted the contract to operate these routes,

70
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,140
getting paid anywhere from $144,000 a year—as in the case of Mokulele Airlines' service

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,840
from Kailui to Hana, Hawaii—up to $4.7 million a year—as in the case of United

72
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,420
Service from Newark to Presque Isle, Maine.

73
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,740
Now, airlines are paid per flight operated, not per passenger, which means that they will

74
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,620
happily and regularly operate flights with just a couple, or no, passengers.

75
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,460
Plenty of airlines running EAS routes would be profitable without selling a single ticket,

76
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,340
solely through the government's payment, so a whole industry has arisen around servicing

77
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,340
these routes.

78
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,020
While the large airlines like United, Delta, and American do bid and operate these routes,

79
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,180
the smallest plane they each operate is a 50-seat CRJ-200.

80
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:19,560
Plenty of these routes have far less demand than that, even if there's just one daily

81
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
flight.

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,100
That's why smaller airlines have evolved.

83
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,300
Take the example of Air Choice One.

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,500
They're a tiny airline operating a dozen Cessna Grand Caravans from Minneapolis to

85
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:34,540
Ironwood, Mason City, and Fort Dodge, Chicago to Ironwood, Mason City, and Burlington, Mason

86
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,820
City to Fort Dodge and Burlington, St. Louis to Burlington, Fort Dodge, Jonesborough,

87
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,860
and Jackson, and then finally Atlanta to Jackson.

88
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,360
Of Air Choice One's 13 routes, every single one is subsidized by the Essential Air Service.

89
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,060
The airline earns $15.7 million in revenue yearly through this before actual ticket sales.

90
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,180
These sorts of small regional airlines, of which there are dozens in the US, would likely

91
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,540
not exist without the Essential Air Service program as the type of flying they do would

92
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,860
certainly not be profitable.

93
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,100
Worth mentioning is that a system of subsidies for routes to small towns is not unique to

94
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,100
the US.

95
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,200
In Europe, they're known as Public Service Obligation Routes, or PSOs.

96
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,060
This system is a little more complicated than the US is with varying terms for when and

97
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,320
how airlines get paid, but the amount of compensation varies quite a bit more than in the US.

98
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:28,620
For example, in the UK, the effective per-passenger subsidy ranges all the way from $4.57 for

99
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,640
Flybe's route from London Heathrow to Newquay up to, apparently, more than $1,000 per passenger

100
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,720
in the case of Airtask's routes in the Shetland Islands.

101
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,000
The US, though, has more federally subsidized routes than the entirety of the European Union

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,920
because, after all, the geography of the US is quite different.

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,680
The US is one of the least dense developed countries in the world.

104
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,220
If the population of the US lived as densely as that of the UK, it would fit comfortably

105
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,940
in just California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona.

106
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,560
Given this spread, it does have an issue with transport.

107
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,920
The rural areas of the US are just hard to get to and from, and this can make a bad economic

108
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,320
situation worse.

109
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,480
As just one example, companies can and have made the decision to move their operations,

110
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,520
whether factories or headquarters, from smaller towns to bigger ones in order to be closer

111
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,260
to large airports.

112
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,840
Outside the US, transport to rural areas is often provided by train and, while part of

113
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,180
the reason for the US's minimal development of passenger railroads is lack of interest,

114
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,700
it would also be tough, in many places, to build a financially viable passenger railroad

115
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,980
due to the country's vastness.

116
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,780
Without these flights, the only public transportation in or out of much of rural America would be

117
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,980
the bus, at best.

118
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,000
In the lower 48, this program helps communities.

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,900
In Alaska, though, there are plenty of communities that quite literally would not exist without

120
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,900
these subsidies.

121
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,220
65 of the US's 179 EAS routes are within the state of Alaska.

122
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:01,020
A big reason for that is that only 14% of Alaska's municipalities are connected to

123
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,820
the outside world by road.

124
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,100
The state is just so vast and harsh that building roads to most of these areas wouldn't make

125
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
sense.

126
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,940
In place of roads, Alaska's rural towns have airports, meaning that, in many cases,

127
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,420
their essential air service subsidized flights are the only ways in or out.

128
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,480
So, the way the essential air service works is clear, but is it effective at its goal

129
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,880
of elevating the economy of rural areas of America?

130
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,880
Well, according to one of the most comprehensive studies done on the matter in recent years,

131
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,700
every 1% increase in passenger traffic at a subsidized airport leads to the per capita

132
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,320
income of that community increasing by 0.12%.

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,120
It's tough to know exactly how much of a passenger number increase the program leads

134
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,880
to, but this at least serves as evidence that the underlying supposition of the program,

135
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,840
that air service leads to economic opportunity, is true.

136
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,440
What's also true, though, is that the essential air service program is not as efficient as

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
it could be.

138
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,320
For example, for the longest time, Southern Airways Express has been getting $2.3 million

139
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,880
a year to fly from Hagerstown, Maryland to Pittsburgh and Baltimore.

140
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,760
That's despite the fact that BWI Airport is just 67 miles or 108 kilometers away from

141
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,800
Hagerstown.

142
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,880
In the air, the flight takes about 30 to 40 minutes, given the slow speed of the Cessna

143
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,320
Grand Caravan.

144
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,800
Traveling between the two airports takes about 70 to 80 minutes and, for anyone without a

145
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,680
car, there are commercial airport shuttles operating between Hagerstown and BWI.

146
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,360
What's more, Hagerstown is also an hour's drive from DC's National and Dulles Airports,

147
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,840
and Hagerstown Airport even has regular, non-EAS subsidized routes to Myrtle Beach, Orlando,

148
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
and Tampa.

149
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:44,260
It's safe to say that a town like Hagerstown is benefiting far less from its multi-million

150
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,960
dollar subsidy than a town like Adak, Alaska.

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,820
That's why, in late October 2019, Hagerstown got the axe—it will no longer be subsidized

152
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,420
by the Essential Air Service program.

153
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,060
Under increased scrutiny, the requirements for this program have gotten stricter and

154
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,120
stricter in recent years.

155
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,340
Nowadays, to be eligible, a community has to be more than 70 miles or 110 kilometers

156
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,680
from the nearest major airport, has to cost the government less than $200 per passenger

157
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,320
if it's within 210 miles or 340 kilometers of the nearest major airport, and has to average

158
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,280
more than 10 passengers per day unless it's further than 175 miles or 280 kilometers from

159
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,160
the nearest major airport.

160
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,480
With these requirements, more and more communities are losing their funding.

161
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,680
Some of these are clearly justified.

162
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,840
While flights might be nice, nobody's losing out on opportunity by having to drive or take

163
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,860
the bus an hour from Hagerstown to BWI.

164
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:40,080
There is and long has been, though, talk of completely eliminating the program.

165
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,220
Now, without telling you what to think, I'm just going to present some numbers.

166
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,760
It costs the US government about $290 million a year to run the Essential Air Service—a

167
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,600
program that connects hundreds of communities to the outside world.

168
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,780
For that same amount of money, the government could build about 40 miles or 65 kilometers

169
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,800
of highway, it could pay to maintain all of the US government's empty or disused buildings

170
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,580
for 62 days, or it could buy one-seventh of a B-2 Spirit bomber.

171
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,160
In government terms, $290 million just isn't that much.

172
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,040
Some exciting news—I've just gotten back from filming a documentary about something,

173
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
somewhere.

174
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,640
That's all the info you get, aside from that it's actually good and that it's

175
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,040
a Nebula original, meaning that to watch it when it comes out at the end of November,

176
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,800
you'll have to head to Nebula—the streaming site built by myself and a bunch of other

177
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
creators.

178
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,620
To make that easier, though, Nebula has partnered with CuriosityStream—the streaming site

179
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,760
home to thousands of top-quality documentaries and non-fiction TV shows.

180
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,440
CuriosityStream is worth signing up for by itself.

181
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,960
Beyond just its great library, it's available pretty much everywhere for a very reasonable

182
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,000
cost of just $3 a month.

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,700
That $3 a month CuriosityStream membership, though, now also gets you access to Nebula

184
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,680
if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.

185
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,520
That's really an amazing deal for two top-quality streaming sites and, the best part is, you'll

186
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,440
be supporting myself and so many other independent creators while you do it.
