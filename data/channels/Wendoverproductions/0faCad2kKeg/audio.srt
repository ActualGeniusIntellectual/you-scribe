1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
This is electromagnetic radiation. You can't see it, but it's there. In fact, it's everywhere,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,280
but here's a more relatable form. This is the color cyan, but, more accurately, this is waves

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:23,920
of electromagnetic radiation oscillating at about 616,856,909,465,021 times per second. As they reach

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
your eyes, light receptive cells translate the radiation into electric signals which travel to

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,040
your brain and are generally perceived as the color that we collectively refer to as cyan.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,560
If we strip away our interpretation, though, the radiation, scaled up about 100,000 times,

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,920
looks like this. The color cyan is waves of energy roughly 486 nanometers wide, but what happens if

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,680
that width tightens? At 380 nanometers, our perception changes to this dark purple. Meanwhile,

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,760
if it expands to a roomy 780 nanometers, our brains interpret the radiation as this shade of

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,800
dark red. Essentially, as the wavelength changes, so too do the properties. So, what happens if we

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,800
change the wavelength more dramatically, like tightening it by 100 times? Well, now the waves

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,320
have much higher energy—they're much more powerful, so much so that they can actually

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,520
pass through some less dense materials like fabric or human tissue—but they aren't quite

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,760
strong enough to pass through denser materials like metal or bone. You can see where this is

15
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,960
going. We refer to these wavelengths as X-rays, and use their special properties to look inside

16
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,800
bags at airport security and inside humans at the hospital. So, what happens at the other end

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,880
of the spectrum? What if, instead of the width of human DNA, the waves were the width of humans?

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,280
Well, this is what we'd refer to as an ultra-high frequency radio wave.

19
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,600
Its comparatively enormous wavelength allows it to travel over huge distances,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,880
pass through obstructions, and even bend around obstacles—all useful properties if you wanted

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,040
to use electromagnetic radiation to, say, communicate. Of course, in order to convey

22
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,240
information using a radio wave, we'd need a way to manipulate the radio wave that corresponds

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,080
to the desired information. For this, there are options. To start with, there's the strength of

24
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,680
the wave. We know that a blue light, for example, can be weak or strong, but no matter if it's weak

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,640
or strong, it's still blue, and the fact that it's blue means that it's still, fundamentally,

26
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,000
the same wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. The same principle applies up the spectrum with

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,200
radio waves—they can be powerful, weak, or anywhere in between, and still be the same

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,280
wavelength. In this context, we call that strength the amplitude. Therefore, we can transmit

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,800
an audio signal, for example, by modifying that amplitude by a proportional amount. The receiver

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
just needs to know how to interpret those amplitude modulations and translate them back to an audio

31
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,040
signal. In the case of an AM radio station, the radio receiver only focuses on the radiation with

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,920
a wavelength 1,119 feet or 341 meters long, for example, and it tracks the amplitude modulations

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,960
to output the audio signal that we end up hearing. Amplitude modulation radio communication has a

34
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,320
number of useful features—it's exceptionally simple and can work over huge distances—but it does

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,760
tend to be highly susceptible to outside interference. That's a big reason why AM radio

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,560
tends to be lower quality and a big reason why it's not as useful a technique for transmitting

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,880
bigger chunks of data. Of course, the wavelength can also be manipulated. That means that we can

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,920
essentially do the same thing, but this time by ever so slightly modifying the distance between

39
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,120
waves. In this context, we'd refer to this as the frequency, which is proportional to wavelength,

40
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,080
but rather than being a physical measure, it's a temporal one—how many times the wave oscillates

41
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,160
within a second. So, by slightly modulating frequency, we can transmit the same audio signal,

42
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,000
but, since this method is less susceptible to interference, we can generally get higher quality.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,280
Now, traditional radio works by encoding the audio signal itself into radio waves using amplitude or

44
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,720
frequency modulation, but computers, phones, essentially everything digital nowadays encodes

45
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,040
its data into binary code—sequences of ones and zeros. This only makes communication using

46
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
electromagnetic radiation better. We could set it up so that when the amplitude is high that

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,680
corresponds to a one, while when it's low it corresponds to a zero, or rather, when frequency

48
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,800
is high that's a one, and when low that's a zero. This is simple and already more efficient

49
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,400
than encoding the analog audio signal, but it could be even more efficient. That's because

50
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
there's yet another wave property that we can manipulate. For these purposes, we can consider

51
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,760
one full cycle of a wave, going up, down, and up again, one phase. But, we can also consider this,

52
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,920
the wave going down, then up, then down again, one phase as well. Therefore, we could assign

53
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:04,080
this upward phase to the binary digit one, and this one, the downward phase, to the binary digit

54
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,840
zero. Then, we can transmit data using a sequence of these different phases. The transmitter doesn't

55
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,040
need one phase to seamlessly go into the next, so it's an even faster, even more efficient way

56
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,080
of encoding binary sequences into electromagnetic radiation. But here's where things get really

57
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,440
cool. There can be more than two phases. We could divide the cycle into one phase starting at the

58
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,240
midpoint going upward, one starting at the crest, one starting at the midpoint going downward,

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,000
and one starting at the trough. So, with four distinct phases, one can correspond to the binary

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,200
sequence zero-one, one to one-one, one to one-zero, and one to zero-zero. Therefore,

61
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,600
we can cram twice as much data into the same signal. But it doesn't stop there. We can even

62
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
take this a step further and have eight distinct phases so that we can transmit

63
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,680
every possible three-digit sequence of ones and zeros, thereby tripling efficiency.

64
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,280
Eight distinct phases is typically the practical limit for wireless data transmission—it becomes

65
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,560
too tough to distinguish between phases with any more, so the error rate is too high—however,

66
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,600
this is just manipulating one property of the wave, and there are, of course, two others.

67
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,920
This phase, initially upward from the midpoint, could be broadcast at a high amplitude or a low

68
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,200
amplitude. So, we can say that the low-amplitude version of this correlates to the binary sequence

69
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,280
zero-zero-zero-zero while the high-amplitude version zero-zero-zero-one. By adding two

70
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,560
amplitude options to each of the eight phases, we get sixteen total transmission options,

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,680
meaning we have enough to correlate to each of the sixteen possible four-digit combinations of

72
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,560
zeros and ones. If we have an accurate enough method of transmission, we could further increase

73
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,000
the number of phase and amplitude combinations to a total of sixty-four, each corresponding to

74
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,320
a six-digit binary sequence. In fact, the newest Wi-Fi standards have one thousand and twenty-four

75
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,120
phase and amplitude combinations, while extremely accurate copper-twisted cables can deal with

76
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,960
thirty-two thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight combinations, each corresponding to a fifteen-digit

77
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,240
sequence. Constrained by the accuracy of wireless communication, your cell phone, meanwhile, uses

78
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,760
as few as sixteen combinations in the case of some 3G networks, and as many as one thousand twenty-four

79
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,280
in the most advanced 5G networks. Fundamentally, though, this is how your cell phone gets a lot

80
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,440
of data out of a little slice of the radio spectrum. Of course, transmitting data is only

81
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,000
half the battle. Something also needs to receive it. That something is, of course, a cell site.

82
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,240
Now, keep in mind that a cell phone is essentially just a fancy walkie-talkie—it uses the exact same

83
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,400
process, just more advanced. In fact, the earliest portable phones, car phones, were just one step

84
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,960
removed from walkie-talkies. A telephone company would set up a radio transmitter in a city,

85
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,200
users would install a bulky system in their car, the system would communicate with the transmitter

86
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,160
just as a walkie-talkie would, and the tower would then plug the signal into the landline network.

87
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,600
Put another way, it was just a city-wide version of cordless landlines. The only difference from

88
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:16,320
walkie-talkies was that these car phones would have a dedicated channel for outbound transmission

89
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,960
and a dedicated channel for inbound transmission so that both sides could talk simultaneously,

90
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,280
unlike with a walkie-talkie where one needs to wait and push to talk since only one channel

91
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,520
is used. These car phones were fairly similar to today's cell phones from a user experience

92
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,360
perspective, but they were horribly inefficient. In their early days, there were only 32 available

93
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,080
channels, meaning only 32 people in a city could use their car phones simultaneously.

94
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,320
In addition, if one left the service area of that one tower in their home city,

95
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,600
their car phones wouldn't work. Of course, the solution was cells.

96
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,680
The idea was this—a given area would be split up into a pattern of hexagons. At the center of

97
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,880
each of those hexagons was a cell site. These are generally thought of as cell towers, but that's

98
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,080
a misnomer since cell sites can be located on buildings, inside church sepals, at the tops of

99
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,040
mountains, or really anywhere that's elevated relative to the typical user. Fundamentally,

100
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,600
these cell sites just send and receive radio signals to and from cell phones, which is a

101
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,800
fairly simple process. Then, they need a way to plug into the wired communication network to

102
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,160
convey data over longer distances. Often, this is accomplished through physical fiber-optic cables,

103
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,360
but especially in more rural areas, that's not always practical. If one put a cell site on the

104
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,760
top of a mountain, for example, it would likely have to operate completely off-grid, powered by

105
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,000
solar or a generator, and it also couldn't physically plug into the wired communication

106
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,160
network due to its isolation. Therefore, these more remote cell sites use microwave transmitters.

107
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,080
Now, tiny microwaves, thanks to their extremely rapid frequency, are incredibly efficient at

108
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,720
moving huge amounts of data fast—the most advanced systems have reached over 100 gigabits per

109
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,040
second—but they're not very resilient. One needs a direct line of sight between the transmitter and

110
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,480
receiver to accurately transmit, which prevents microwaves' use for portable cell phones. However,

111
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,560
for fixed cell sites, this is possible. So, many are set up with microwave transmission systems

112
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,200
that relay signal to the closest site with a physical link to the wired communication network.

113
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,320
With both a wired and wireless option, cell sites can be located nearly anywhere,

114
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,600
which is important because their location absolutely matters. Centering their hexagon,

115
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,760
the signal from each of these sites must reach far enough that there is some overlap between

116
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,800
the cells. That way, if a cell phone is being used on the move, the call can be seamlessly passed

117
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,440
from one cell site to the next with no drop-off in signal, and the network can be expanded far

118
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,040
beyond the reach of one transmitter. However, the system starts to seem less ingenious once

119
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,920
you do the math. Originally, only 832 different frequencies were allocated for use by cell phones.

120
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,720
There are a lot of different uses for the radio spectrum, so regulatory bodies like the American

121
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,160
FCC, British Ofcom, or German Bnetze can only allocate so many frequencies for different

122
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,760
industries, and spectrum allocation is crucial so that two users don't try to use the same frequency,

123
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,600
which would render both of their uses useless. So, of those 832 frequencies,

124
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,920
42 were used by the cell network for its own back-end internal communication. That left 790,

125
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,040
but a call required both an outbound and inbound frequency, effectively meaning there were only

126
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,840
395 call channels. However, in order to prevent interference, no two bordering cells could use

127
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,200
the same frequency. As each hexagon had six neighbors, that meant each cell could only use

128
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,160
one-seventh of the available channels. So, each cell had 56 channels, meaning 56 users within each

129
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,840
cell could make a call at a given time. This initially worked fine, but then cell phones

130
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:59,680
got popular. To keep up with demand, cell carriers needed to find a way to do more with a single

131
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,640
frequency. When the second generation of mobile networks came along, calls were no longer

132
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,960
transmitted as analog audio waves. Rather, they started to use those digital signals, encoded

133
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,640
using phase and amplitude. The thing was, this method was more efficient, meaning using a whole

134
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:22,400
channel to transmit a single voice conversation was overkill—one only needed part of it.

135
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,800
Of course, the difficulty was that voice conversations happen in real-time—it's

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,680
not like you could compress an entire two-minute call and send it at the end. Therefore, cell

137
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,120
companies divided a given channel into eight time slots. These time slots would rotate one

138
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,240
after another in rapid succession, and a given phone would be told to use, say, the third time

139
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,840
slot. So, each time that time slot came up, it would fire off its ones and zeros quickly, then

140
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,240
wait for it to come around again, but because the data was compressed into an efficient digital

141
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,880
signal, the amount received during a time slot would be enough to decode into enough of the

142
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,320
conversation to play until the next time slot came up. This system meant that one channel could

143
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:11,920
now be used by eight phones simultaneously—what was 56 channels now became 448. But, eventually,

144
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,000
as phones became ever more commonplace, this system of time-division multiple access became,

145
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,320
once again, not good enough. The next evolution was where things got complicated,

146
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,920
but also fascinating. It's called code division multiple access. It's an ingenious way where

147
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:38,880
multiple phones can send and receive data on the same channel truly simultaneously. To explain the

148
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,160
incredibly simple version, let's say a first user wants to transmit the binary sequence 11,

149
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,880
a second user 01, and a third 10. Now, each of these users would be allocated what's called

150
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:59,280
a spreading code—0101, 0011, and 0000, respectively. For the first user,

151
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:05,200
their first binary digit, 1, would be compared to each of the four digits of their spreading code.

152
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,960
If the spread code digit and the binary digit is the same, it will output a 0. If it's different,

153
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:18,800
it will output a 1. So, for user 1, the output sequence would be 10101010. The process would

154
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,240
repeat for user 2, which outputs 00111100, and user 3, which outputs 111100. Next, the sequences

155
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,320
are translated so that zeros become positive ones and ones become negative ones. Then, each digit of

156
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,000
the three sequences of numbers are added together. That outputs the composite sequence negative 11,

157
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
negative 3, negative 1, negative 1, 1, 1, 3. This composite sequence is what is then transmitted

158
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,680
using a single channel. Now, the exact details of this process are not tremendously important,

159
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:58,240
but what is is what happens next. What happens next is that this process is reversed.

160
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,120
So, the receiver of that composite sequence would know each user's unique spreading code.

161
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,440
The spreading code is also translated so that zeros become positive ones and ones become

162
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,000
negative ones, and then the receiver multiplies the composite sequence with this translated

163
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,160
spreading code. For user 1, that outputs negative 1, negative 1, negative 3, 1, negative 1,

164
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:23,760
negative 1, 1, negative 3. Now, the first four digits of this sequence, which we know correlate

165
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,000
with the first digit of the data, are added together to get negative 4, which is then

166
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,360
divided by 4 to get negative 1. The process repeats for the second set of four to get negative 1.

167
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,400
Now, if we translate this back so that negative ones become ones and positive ones become zeros,

168
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:44,160
then we get the data sequence, 1, 1. With just the composite sequence and the unique

169
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,640
spreading code, this process figured out what user 1's unique data sequence was. If we repeat

170
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,720
this entire decoding process with user 2's spreading code, we get 0, 1—its data sequence—and

171
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:03,120
unsurprisingly, it also works for user 3. So, with one composite signal and three unique spreading

172
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,040
codes, we are able to triple up the use of one channel. In practice, this process works at a

173
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,960
much larger, much more complex scale, but it uses these same mathematical principles.

174
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,680
This, fundamentally, is how cell service works. Making a two-way radio work for one person is

175
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,480
simple. Making a two-way radio work for everyone, in the same area, at the same time, is difficult.

176
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,720
It's all about packing as much data as possible into a single transmission,

177
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
and then packing as many transmissions as possible into a single radio wave.

178
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,600
The aforementioned techniques to accomplish these two goals are only the tip of the iceberg.

179
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,080
Many of the most advanced networks have moved onto a system called orthogonal frequency division

180
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,240
multiple access to pack even more transmissions into a single wavelength, for example,

181
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,840
but they are indicative of the process that got us to today. When we move from 3G to 4G

182
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:03,200
and 4G to 5, what's happening in the background is incredibly smart people finding more and more

183
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,320
ingenious methods of transmitting more data using these same resources, all so that we,

184
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:13,840
the end users, can browse Twitter and watch YouTube just ever so slightly faster.

185
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,600
Now that this video's over, I am extremely excited to announce that in just two weeks,

186
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,440
we'll be releasing our first ever feature-length documentary. It's called The Colorado Problem—A

187
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,400
River in the Red. Never before have I been more surprised that a story isn't covered more.

188
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,440
The Colorado River, the river that single-handedly supplies water for the entire desert region of the

189
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,600
American Southwest, is becoming smaller and smaller and smaller each year and the reserves

190
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,680
are almost gone. Put another way, in much of Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California,

191
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:52,400
people need more water than they can get. Our documentary covers what led to such a

192
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,040
cataclysmic problem, and the harsh reality of the future for the American Southwest.

193
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,040
You'll be able to watch it on either CuriosityStream or Nebula when it releases

194
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,360
on February 8th, but of course, if you're not currently a subscriber of either of those

195
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,920
streaming services, the CuriosityStream-Nebula bundle deal, available on sale now for less than

196
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:16,400
