0	6480	This is electromagnetic radiation. You can't see it, but it's there. In fact, it's everywhere,
6480	13280	but here's a more relatable form. This is the color cyan, but, more accurately, this is waves
13280	23920	of electromagnetic radiation oscillating at about 616,856,909,465,021 times per second. As they reach
23920	28480	your eyes, light receptive cells translate the radiation into electric signals which travel to
28480	33040	your brain and are generally perceived as the color that we collectively refer to as cyan.
33040	38560	If we strip away our interpretation, though, the radiation, scaled up about 100,000 times,
38560	45920	looks like this. The color cyan is waves of energy roughly 486 nanometers wide, but what happens if
45920	53680	that width tightens? At 380 nanometers, our perception changes to this dark purple. Meanwhile,
53680	59760	if it expands to a roomy 780 nanometers, our brains interpret the radiation as this shade of
59760	66800	dark red. Essentially, as the wavelength changes, so too do the properties. So, what happens if we
66800	72800	change the wavelength more dramatically, like tightening it by 100 times? Well, now the waves
72800	78320	have much higher energy—they're much more powerful, so much so that they can actually
78320	83520	pass through some less dense materials like fabric or human tissue—but they aren't quite
83520	87760	strong enough to pass through denser materials like metal or bone. You can see where this is
87760	92960	going. We refer to these wavelengths as X-rays, and use their special properties to look inside
92960	98800	bags at airport security and inside humans at the hospital. So, what happens at the other end
98800	104880	of the spectrum? What if, instead of the width of human DNA, the waves were the width of humans?
104880	109280	Well, this is what we'd refer to as an ultra-high frequency radio wave.
109280	113600	Its comparatively enormous wavelength allows it to travel over huge distances,
113600	118880	pass through obstructions, and even bend around obstacles—all useful properties if you wanted
118880	125040	to use electromagnetic radiation to, say, communicate. Of course, in order to convey
125040	130240	information using a radio wave, we'd need a way to manipulate the radio wave that corresponds
130240	136080	to the desired information. For this, there are options. To start with, there's the strength of
136080	141680	the wave. We know that a blue light, for example, can be weak or strong, but no matter if it's weak
141680	146640	or strong, it's still blue, and the fact that it's blue means that it's still, fundamentally,
146640	152000	the same wavelength of electromagnetic radiation. The same principle applies up the spectrum with
152000	157200	radio waves—they can be powerful, weak, or anywhere in between, and still be the same
157200	163280	wavelength. In this context, we call that strength the amplitude. Therefore, we can transmit
163280	168800	an audio signal, for example, by modifying that amplitude by a proportional amount. The receiver
168800	173680	just needs to know how to interpret those amplitude modulations and translate them back to an audio
173680	179040	signal. In the case of an AM radio station, the radio receiver only focuses on the radiation with
179040	185920	a wavelength 1,119 feet or 341 meters long, for example, and it tracks the amplitude modulations
185920	190960	to output the audio signal that we end up hearing. Amplitude modulation radio communication has a
190960	196320	number of useful features—it's exceptionally simple and can work over huge distances—but it does
196320	201760	tend to be highly susceptible to outside interference. That's a big reason why AM radio
201760	206560	tends to be lower quality and a big reason why it's not as useful a technique for transmitting
206560	212880	bigger chunks of data. Of course, the wavelength can also be manipulated. That means that we can
212880	217920	essentially do the same thing, but this time by ever so slightly modifying the distance between
217920	223120	waves. In this context, we'd refer to this as the frequency, which is proportional to wavelength,
223120	228080	but rather than being a physical measure, it's a temporal one—how many times the wave oscillates
228080	234160	within a second. So, by slightly modulating frequency, we can transmit the same audio signal,
234160	240000	but, since this method is less susceptible to interference, we can generally get higher quality.
240000	245280	Now, traditional radio works by encoding the audio signal itself into radio waves using amplitude or
245280	250720	frequency modulation, but computers, phones, essentially everything digital nowadays encodes
250720	257040	its data into binary code—sequences of ones and zeros. This only makes communication using
257040	262000	electromagnetic radiation better. We could set it up so that when the amplitude is high that
262000	267680	corresponds to a one, while when it's low it corresponds to a zero, or rather, when frequency
267680	272800	is high that's a one, and when low that's a zero. This is simple and already more efficient
272800	278400	than encoding the analog audio signal, but it could be even more efficient. That's because
278400	283840	there's yet another wave property that we can manipulate. For these purposes, we can consider
283840	291760	one full cycle of a wave, going up, down, and up again, one phase. But, we can also consider this,
291840	297920	the wave going down, then up, then down again, one phase as well. Therefore, we could assign
297920	304080	this upward phase to the binary digit one, and this one, the downward phase, to the binary digit
304080	309840	zero. Then, we can transmit data using a sequence of these different phases. The transmitter doesn't
309840	315040	need one phase to seamlessly go into the next, so it's an even faster, even more efficient way
315040	320080	of encoding binary sequences into electromagnetic radiation. But here's where things get really
320080	325440	cool. There can be more than two phases. We could divide the cycle into one phase starting at the
325440	330240	midpoint going upward, one starting at the crest, one starting at the midpoint going downward,
330240	336000	and one starting at the trough. So, with four distinct phases, one can correspond to the binary
336000	343200	sequence zero-one, one to one-one, one to one-zero, and one to zero-zero. Therefore,
343200	349600	we can cram twice as much data into the same signal. But it doesn't stop there. We can even
349680	354160	take this a step further and have eight distinct phases so that we can transmit
354160	359680	every possible three-digit sequence of ones and zeros, thereby tripling efficiency.
359680	365280	Eight distinct phases is typically the practical limit for wireless data transmission—it becomes
365280	370560	too tough to distinguish between phases with any more, so the error rate is too high—however,
370560	375600	this is just manipulating one property of the wave, and there are, of course, two others.
376160	381920	This phase, initially upward from the midpoint, could be broadcast at a high amplitude or a low
381920	387200	amplitude. So, we can say that the low-amplitude version of this correlates to the binary sequence
387200	393280	zero-zero-zero-zero while the high-amplitude version zero-zero-zero-one. By adding two
393280	398560	amplitude options to each of the eight phases, we get sixteen total transmission options,
398560	403680	meaning we have enough to correlate to each of the sixteen possible four-digit combinations of
403680	408560	zeros and ones. If we have an accurate enough method of transmission, we could further increase
408560	414000	the number of phase and amplitude combinations to a total of sixty-four, each corresponding to
414000	420320	a six-digit binary sequence. In fact, the newest Wi-Fi standards have one thousand and twenty-four
420320	425120	phase and amplitude combinations, while extremely accurate copper-twisted cables can deal with
425120	430960	thirty-two thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight combinations, each corresponding to a fifteen-digit
430960	436240	sequence. Constrained by the accuracy of wireless communication, your cell phone, meanwhile, uses
436240	441760	as few as sixteen combinations in the case of some 3G networks, and as many as one thousand twenty-four
441760	447280	in the most advanced 5G networks. Fundamentally, though, this is how your cell phone gets a lot
447280	453440	of data out of a little slice of the radio spectrum. Of course, transmitting data is only
453440	460000	half the battle. Something also needs to receive it. That something is, of course, a cell site.
460640	466240	Now, keep in mind that a cell phone is essentially just a fancy walkie-talkie—it uses the exact same
466240	472400	process, just more advanced. In fact, the earliest portable phones, car phones, were just one step
472400	476960	removed from walkie-talkies. A telephone company would set up a radio transmitter in a city,
476960	481200	users would install a bulky system in their car, the system would communicate with the transmitter
481200	486160	just as a walkie-talkie would, and the tower would then plug the signal into the landline network.
486160	491600	Put another way, it was just a city-wide version of cordless landlines. The only difference from
491600	496320	walkie-talkies was that these car phones would have a dedicated channel for outbound transmission
496320	500960	and a dedicated channel for inbound transmission so that both sides could talk simultaneously,
500960	505280	unlike with a walkie-talkie where one needs to wait and push to talk since only one channel
505280	509520	is used. These car phones were fairly similar to today's cell phones from a user experience
509520	515360	perspective, but they were horribly inefficient. In their early days, there were only 32 available
515360	520080	channels, meaning only 32 people in a city could use their car phones simultaneously.
520080	524320	In addition, if one left the service area of that one tower in their home city,
524320	529600	their car phones wouldn't work. Of course, the solution was cells.
530240	535680	The idea was this—a given area would be split up into a pattern of hexagons. At the center of
535680	540880	each of those hexagons was a cell site. These are generally thought of as cell towers, but that's
540880	546080	a misnomer since cell sites can be located on buildings, inside church sepals, at the tops of
546080	551040	mountains, or really anywhere that's elevated relative to the typical user. Fundamentally,
551040	555600	these cell sites just send and receive radio signals to and from cell phones, which is a
555600	560800	fairly simple process. Then, they need a way to plug into the wired communication network to
560800	566160	convey data over longer distances. Often, this is accomplished through physical fiber-optic cables,
566160	571360	but especially in more rural areas, that's not always practical. If one put a cell site on the
571360	575760	top of a mountain, for example, it would likely have to operate completely off-grid, powered by
575760	580000	solar or a generator, and it also couldn't physically plug into the wired communication
580000	586160	network due to its isolation. Therefore, these more remote cell sites use microwave transmitters.
586800	592080	Now, tiny microwaves, thanks to their extremely rapid frequency, are incredibly efficient at
592080	596720	moving huge amounts of data fast—the most advanced systems have reached over 100 gigabits per
596720	603040	second—but they're not very resilient. One needs a direct line of sight between the transmitter and
603040	608480	receiver to accurately transmit, which prevents microwaves' use for portable cell phones. However,
608480	614560	for fixed cell sites, this is possible. So, many are set up with microwave transmission systems
614560	619200	that relay signal to the closest site with a physical link to the wired communication network.
619200	624320	With both a wired and wireless option, cell sites can be located nearly anywhere,
624320	629600	which is important because their location absolutely matters. Centering their hexagon,
629600	633760	the signal from each of these sites must reach far enough that there is some overlap between
633760	638800	the cells. That way, if a cell phone is being used on the move, the call can be seamlessly passed
638800	643440	from one cell site to the next with no drop-off in signal, and the network can be expanded far
643440	649040	beyond the reach of one transmitter. However, the system starts to seem less ingenious once
649040	655920	you do the math. Originally, only 832 different frequencies were allocated for use by cell phones.
655920	660720	There are a lot of different uses for the radio spectrum, so regulatory bodies like the American
660720	666160	FCC, British Ofcom, or German Bnetze can only allocate so many frequencies for different
666160	671760	industries, and spectrum allocation is crucial so that two users don't try to use the same frequency,
671760	677600	which would render both of their uses useless. So, of those 832 frequencies,
677600	683920	42 were used by the cell network for its own back-end internal communication. That left 790,
683920	689040	but a call required both an outbound and inbound frequency, effectively meaning there were only
689040	695840	395 call channels. However, in order to prevent interference, no two bordering cells could use
695840	701200	the same frequency. As each hexagon had six neighbors, that meant each cell could only use
701200	708160	one-seventh of the available channels. So, each cell had 56 channels, meaning 56 users within each
708160	713840	cell could make a call at a given time. This initially worked fine, but then cell phones
713840	719680	got popular. To keep up with demand, cell carriers needed to find a way to do more with a single
719680	724640	frequency. When the second generation of mobile networks came along, calls were no longer
724640	730960	transmitted as analog audio waves. Rather, they started to use those digital signals, encoded
730960	736640	using phase and amplitude. The thing was, this method was more efficient, meaning using a whole
736640	742400	channel to transmit a single voice conversation was overkill—one only needed part of it.
742400	746800	Of course, the difficulty was that voice conversations happen in real-time—it's
746800	751680	not like you could compress an entire two-minute call and send it at the end. Therefore, cell
751680	757120	companies divided a given channel into eight time slots. These time slots would rotate one
757120	762240	after another in rapid succession, and a given phone would be told to use, say, the third time
762240	767840	slot. So, each time that time slot came up, it would fire off its ones and zeros quickly, then
767840	772240	wait for it to come around again, but because the data was compressed into an efficient digital
772240	776880	signal, the amount received during a time slot would be enough to decode into enough of the
776880	782320	conversation to play until the next time slot came up. This system meant that one channel could
782320	791920	now be used by eight phones simultaneously—what was 56 channels now became 448. But, eventually,
791920	798000	as phones became ever more commonplace, this system of time-division multiple access became,
798000	804320	once again, not good enough. The next evolution was where things got complicated,
804320	811920	but also fascinating. It's called code division multiple access. It's an ingenious way where
811920	818880	multiple phones can send and receive data on the same channel truly simultaneously. To explain the
818880	824160	incredibly simple version, let's say a first user wants to transmit the binary sequence 11,
824160	830880	a second user 01, and a third 10. Now, each of these users would be allocated what's called
830880	839280	a spreading code—0101, 0011, and 0000, respectively. For the first user,
839280	845200	their first binary digit, 1, would be compared to each of the four digits of their spreading code.
845200	850960	If the spread code digit and the binary digit is the same, it will output a 0. If it's different,
850960	858800	it will output a 1. So, for user 1, the output sequence would be 10101010. The process would
858800	868240	repeat for user 2, which outputs 00111100, and user 3, which outputs 111100. Next, the sequences
868240	874320	are translated so that zeros become positive ones and ones become negative ones. Then, each digit of
874320	880000	the three sequences of numbers are added together. That outputs the composite sequence negative 11,
880000	886000	negative 3, negative 1, negative 1, 1, 1, 3. This composite sequence is what is then transmitted
886000	891680	using a single channel. Now, the exact details of this process are not tremendously important,
891680	898240	but what is is what happens next. What happens next is that this process is reversed.
898240	903120	So, the receiver of that composite sequence would know each user's unique spreading code.
903120	907440	The spreading code is also translated so that zeros become positive ones and ones become
907440	912000	negative ones, and then the receiver multiplies the composite sequence with this translated
912000	918160	spreading code. For user 1, that outputs negative 1, negative 1, negative 3, 1, negative 1,
918160	923760	negative 1, 1, negative 3. Now, the first four digits of this sequence, which we know correlate
923760	928000	with the first digit of the data, are added together to get negative 4, which is then
928000	933360	divided by 4 to get negative 1. The process repeats for the second set of four to get negative 1.
933360	938400	Now, if we translate this back so that negative ones become ones and positive ones become zeros,
938400	944160	then we get the data sequence, 1, 1. With just the composite sequence and the unique
944160	950640	spreading code, this process figured out what user 1's unique data sequence was. If we repeat
950640	956720	this entire decoding process with user 2's spreading code, we get 0, 1—its data sequence—and
956720	963120	unsurprisingly, it also works for user 3. So, with one composite signal and three unique spreading
963120	969040	codes, we are able to triple up the use of one channel. In practice, this process works at a
969040	974960	much larger, much more complex scale, but it uses these same mathematical principles.
975600	983680	This, fundamentally, is how cell service works. Making a two-way radio work for one person is
983680	990480	simple. Making a two-way radio work for everyone, in the same area, at the same time, is difficult.
990480	994720	It's all about packing as much data as possible into a single transmission,
994720	999040	and then packing as many transmissions as possible into a single radio wave.
999040	1003600	The aforementioned techniques to accomplish these two goals are only the tip of the iceberg.
1003600	1008080	Many of the most advanced networks have moved onto a system called orthogonal frequency division
1008080	1012240	multiple access to pack even more transmissions into a single wavelength, for example,
1012240	1017840	but they are indicative of the process that got us to today. When we move from 3G to 4G
1017840	1023200	and 4G to 5, what's happening in the background is incredibly smart people finding more and more
1023200	1028320	ingenious methods of transmitting more data using these same resources, all so that we,
1028320	1033840	the end users, can browse Twitter and watch YouTube just ever so slightly faster.
1035200	1039600	Now that this video's over, I am extremely excited to announce that in just two weeks,
1039600	1045440	we'll be releasing our first ever feature-length documentary. It's called The Colorado Problem—A
1045440	1050400	River in the Red. Never before have I been more surprised that a story isn't covered more.
1050400	1055440	The Colorado River, the river that single-handedly supplies water for the entire desert region of the
1055440	1061600	American Southwest, is becoming smaller and smaller and smaller each year and the reserves
1061600	1067680	are almost gone. Put another way, in much of Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California,
1067680	1072400	people need more water than they can get. Our documentary covers what led to such a
1072400	1077040	cataclysmic problem, and the harsh reality of the future for the American Southwest.
1077040	1081040	You'll be able to watch it on either CuriosityStream or Nebula when it releases
1081040	1085360	on February 8th, but of course, if you're not currently a subscriber of either of those
1085360	1089920	streaming services, the CuriosityStream-Nebula bundle deal, available on sale now for less than
1089920	1096400	$15 a year at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, gets you access to both. CuriosityStream has a
