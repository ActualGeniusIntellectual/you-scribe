00:00.000 --> 00:02.940
China… has a problem.

00:02.940 --> 00:06.240
The country's getting hotter, and it's getting wealthier.

00:06.240 --> 00:11.400
While in isolation one is a global challenge and the other a domestic triumph, in concert

00:11.400 --> 00:15.440
they present an issue because of this—the air conditioner.

00:15.440 --> 00:20.000
Fix China on its latitudes and move it along the longitudes, and one can see that its size,

00:20.000 --> 00:24.640
shape, and southerness is not all that different from the US's, and that reflects in its

00:24.640 --> 00:25.640
climate.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.960
Beijing's temperatures closely track with those of DC year-round, while Shanghai's

00:29.960 --> 00:31.120
reflect those of Atlanta.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.680
That's to say, China, like the US, is hot.

00:35.680 --> 00:39.720
Much of the US developed in an era of air conditioning—Florida, Texas, and Arizona

00:39.720 --> 00:44.700
had their biggest population influxes at a time when inside and out no longer correlated,

00:44.700 --> 00:49.260
and this is a direct contributor to the fact that the US today has the highest electricity

00:49.260 --> 00:52.480
consumption per capita of any major economy.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.300
China's marching down the same path—two out of every five air conditioning units made

00:57.300 --> 01:00.060
today are being sold to a Chinese person.

01:00.060 --> 01:05.340
Simply put, as personal income grows, air conditioning use grows, and so on the hottest

01:05.340 --> 01:11.580
of hottest days, some 50% of electricity consumption in China is now directly devoted to cooling

01:11.580 --> 01:16.420
down buildings—and this is only a single instance of a broader phenomena.

01:16.420 --> 01:20.340
Across the board, the exponential increase in electricity consumption as nations grow

01:20.340 --> 01:24.300
wealthier is a well-accepted and well-documented phenomena.

01:24.300 --> 01:28.580
Other prosperous regions have found a tenuous equilibrium between wealth gains and efficiency

01:28.580 --> 01:29.580
gains.

01:29.580 --> 01:33.420
Europe and the US's year-over-year electricity consumptions have more or less plateaued,

01:33.420 --> 01:38.860
but China's looks like this—it's just growing, and growing, and growing.

01:38.860 --> 01:44.360
And most crucially, no country the size of China has ever, in history, developed at the

01:44.360 --> 01:45.860
speed of China.

01:45.860 --> 01:51.460
Its people are marching up the wealth pyramid at an unprecedented pace, and so too, of course,

01:51.460 --> 01:53.580
is its electricity consumption.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.300
This has led to difficulties.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.660
China's no stranger to the occasional power crunch.

01:59.660 --> 02:03.220
In a rapidly growing economy, these effectively represent growing pains.

02:03.220 --> 02:08.760
But the power crunch across China in September and October of 2021 was different.

02:08.760 --> 02:13.160
As in other periods of unseasonably high temperatures, power-strapped grid operators accounted for

02:13.160 --> 02:16.820
an uptick in air conditioning and fans by cutting streetlights and other municipal power

02:16.820 --> 02:18.720
uses they could live without.

02:18.720 --> 02:22.820
Then they placed cuts on industrial users, notifying manufacturers and suppliers for

02:22.820 --> 02:26.340
the likes of Tesla and Apple that factory operations would have to slow for the coming

02:26.340 --> 02:27.340
week or two.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.640
While the move put a damper on the Chinese economy rallying for the first time since

02:30.640 --> 02:36.040
pandemic shutdowns, a temporary slowdown wouldn't be a major issue in the grand scheme of things.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.360
Then it got worse.

02:37.360 --> 02:41.820
Scorching droughts persisted across central China, winds unexpectedly died in the north,

02:41.820 --> 02:46.380
and across the entire country, coal reserves dwindled to a day or two's worth.

02:46.380 --> 02:50.060
Suddenly, the power crunch became rolling blackouts.

02:50.060 --> 02:53.900
For hours, Chinese cities went dark.

02:53.900 --> 02:58.100
In Laoyang, cars stacked up when traffic lights shut off, and metal workers ended up in the

02:58.100 --> 03:01.060
hospital when factory exhaust systems shut down.

03:01.060 --> 03:05.740
Shops ran by candlelight, city advised residents to stock up on clean water, building managers

03:05.740 --> 03:09.660
asked tenants to take the stairs, while at least one family got stuck in an elevator

03:09.660 --> 03:11.720
when power suddenly cut out.

03:11.720 --> 03:16.800
The international media called it unprecedented, and some Chinese citizens compared the outages

03:16.800 --> 03:19.180
to living in North Korea.

03:19.180 --> 03:23.260
To understand the true source of the crisis, beyond the short-term, simple supply and demand

03:23.260 --> 03:27.860
imbalance, one must understand China's electric grid, and to understand its grid, one must

03:27.860 --> 03:32.840
understand this—coal is everything.

03:32.840 --> 03:38.520
The two other areas with similar GDPs, Europe and the US, produce about 18 and 21% of their

03:38.520 --> 03:40.920
electricity with coal, respectively.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.920
In China, it's 62%.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.740
In fact, about half of the entire world's coal power generation capacity is within the

03:49.740 --> 03:51.240
People's Republic.

03:51.240 --> 03:56.420
In context, this isn't surprising—two or three decades ago, coal was far more significant

03:56.420 --> 04:00.260
in Europe and the US's energy mix, but in the years since, there's been a notable

04:00.260 --> 04:04.680
shift towards cleaner, more flexible, natural gas-fired power plants.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.020
China couldn't do that, at least not easily.

04:07.020 --> 04:10.980
One of the country's critical weaknesses in today's world is that it lacks significant

04:10.980 --> 04:12.940
domestic oil and gas production.

04:12.960 --> 04:17.280
It imports about half of the natural gas it uses, which means it's expensive, which

04:17.280 --> 04:22.080
means it doesn't use the fossil fuel for generating electricity, at least in any significant

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
way.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.160
Meanwhile, China is swimming in coal.

04:26.160 --> 04:31.080
Enormous deposits sit in Inner Mongolia and the Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces—the country

04:31.080 --> 04:36.120
has more natural coal deposits than anyone but Russia, Australia, and the US.

04:36.120 --> 04:40.640
Many forms of renewable electricity generation are now cost-competitive with coal and gas

04:40.640 --> 04:48.380
generation, but remember, China has been growing unbelievably, unprecedentedly fast.

04:48.380 --> 04:52.820
While the overall cost per kilowatt-hour of solar, for example, might be the same or lower

04:52.820 --> 04:57.280
than that of coal power, there's the question of when the money is spent.

04:57.280 --> 05:02.640
With solar, nearly all of the cost is upfront in the production and installation of panels.

05:02.640 --> 05:07.340
With coal, however, the cost is more distributed through the lifetime of use—there's a

05:07.340 --> 05:11.560
lower initial installation cost per unit of capacity—but it raises through time,

05:11.560 --> 05:15.380
with use, as coal has to be purchased to keep the generation ongoing.

05:15.380 --> 05:20.000
So when a country is growing at such a pace, it's much easier to spend less upfront to

05:20.000 --> 05:24.820
add capacity, knowing that more money is coming, rather than spend a larger amount upfront

05:24.820 --> 05:26.620
knowing the savings will come later.

05:26.620 --> 05:31.340
It's that simple reality that has undergirded the centrality of coal in China's energy

05:31.340 --> 05:32.340
mix.

05:32.340 --> 05:38.180
Now, the companies actually producing power in China are, almost universally, state-owned

05:38.180 --> 05:42.220
enterprises, but despite reporting up to the central government, on a day-to-day basis,

05:42.220 --> 05:46.440
these businesses do act with a certain degree of autonomy, responding to market conditions

05:46.440 --> 05:51.660
similar to how a privately-owned enterprise would—but this is a unique market.

05:51.660 --> 05:56.040
Beijing regulates how much power producers get paid for the electricity they make—typically

05:56.040 --> 06:00.280
it hovers around 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, far below the world average.

06:00.280 --> 06:05.900
The country considers this crucial because, still today, it's a largely industrial economy.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.040
Industry requires power, and just as China is competitive with the rest of the world

06:09.040 --> 06:13.240
thanks to its low labor costs, it's also competitive thanks to its low electricity

06:13.240 --> 06:18.560
costs—but low costs mean nothing if there's no electricity to be consumed.

06:18.560 --> 06:25.080
Notably, and crucially, Beijing does not regulate the cost of coal—it fluctuates wildly up

06:25.080 --> 06:28.160
and down, just as it does in the rest of the world.

06:28.160 --> 06:34.520
So companies get paid a fixed amount for what they make, but their input cost—the coal—changes.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.600
It doesn't take an expert to spot the potential issue with this.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.680
So why not renewables?

06:40.680 --> 06:45.240
Ignoring for the moment the difficulties in upfront financing, if solar and wind are competitive

06:45.240 --> 06:50.040
in cost with coal-fired power and aren't vulnerable to the short-term up-and-down fluctuations

06:50.040 --> 06:52.800
in coal prices, wouldn't they be the clear winner?

06:52.800 --> 06:56.840
Wouldn't a solar installation producing for less than 8 cents per kilowatt-hour be

06:56.840 --> 06:59.400
a guaranteed profit machine?

06:59.400 --> 07:01.680
Yes, but…

07:01.680 --> 07:07.240
Most Chinese people live where favorable conditions for renewable energy simply aren't.

07:07.240 --> 07:11.560
The country's greatest solar energy potential lies largely in the arid west and along the

07:11.560 --> 07:12.980
northern border.

07:12.980 --> 07:16.920
The same goes for wind—these regions in the far west and borderland north are also

07:16.920 --> 07:19.760
where the nation's most consistent wind potentials lie.

07:19.760 --> 07:25.040
The difficulty is, more than 90% of China's population resides on the southeast side of

07:25.040 --> 07:29.100
this divide—far from the most productive areas for renewables.

07:29.100 --> 07:32.680
Even when it comes to the nation's most heavily developed renewable, hydropower, many

07:32.680 --> 07:36.840
of the nation's largest dams are located in southern and southwestern China—near

07:36.840 --> 07:41.560
moderately populated areas, but still far from the most densely populated provinces.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.240
Making the most of renewable resources, and the already impressive amount of renewable

07:45.240 --> 07:49.160
infrastructure the central government has built out then, requires efficient means of

07:49.160 --> 07:55.680
transferring electricity over vast distances and a flexible, interconnected grid.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.600
Alongside the massive dams, solar installations, and wind farms China's taken on in the past

07:59.600 --> 08:03.900
decade is an equally impressive assortment of transmission lines, increasingly connecting

08:03.900 --> 08:08.360
the sunny, windswept hinterlands to population and industrial centers.

08:08.360 --> 08:12.920
This is an ultra-high voltage power line, and of the 36 that exist globally, China's

08:12.920 --> 08:16.000
home to 34 of them, with plans to build more.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.640
While standard overhead transmission lines run from 110 to 500 kilovolts, these run from

08:20.640 --> 08:26.420
800 to 1100, resulting in massive efficiency gains, and in turn, allowing these long-distance

08:26.420 --> 08:29.860
lines to move up to five times the power of a standard line.

08:29.860 --> 08:33.880
In China, they've been identified as the key to linking areas of high energy consumption

08:33.880 --> 08:36.440
with areas of high renewable production.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.280
And yet, while these infrastructure investments have built out wind and solar plants in remote

08:40.280 --> 08:44.480
areas as far east as the deserts of Xinjiang, then connected them directly to industrial

08:44.480 --> 08:49.920
centers like the Yanhui province, 2,000 miles or 3,200 kilometers away, China has yet to

08:49.920 --> 08:52.040
make the most out of their green investments.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.280
At the end of 2020, a report surfaced that China's future forward ultra-high voltage

08:56.280 --> 09:00.280
lines were only running at a paltry 60% of capacity.

09:00.280 --> 09:05.600
For a country with a still-climbing coal habit, this dramatic underutilization was disappointing,

09:05.600 --> 09:10.480
but not necessarily an indictment of the physical grid—rather, an indictment of how China's

09:10.480 --> 09:12.720
grid works on a policy and pricing level.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.680
China has yet to properly incentivize their renewables.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.200
They've addressed the supply side, but largely ignored demand.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.320
Critical to the full implementation of China's solar and wind farms and the power lines connecting

09:23.320 --> 09:28.040
them to population centers is the willingness of Chinese provinces to buy energy from one

09:28.040 --> 09:29.200
another.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.080
Because energy rates are set by the government rather than a market, provinces, which are

09:33.080 --> 09:36.920
largely in charge of their own grids, have prioritized purchasing electricity within

09:36.920 --> 09:41.500
their own borders, regardless of its origin, to keep the money local.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.180
Why give another province the work that could exist within?

09:44.180 --> 09:48.500
And because the provinces that need more power are more densely populated or more industrialized,

09:48.500 --> 09:52.680
they're probably eastern or coastal, and likely buying power from nearby coal plants

09:52.680 --> 09:55.220
rather than out-of-province renewables.

09:55.220 --> 09:59.820
Available renewables then take a back seat—they get used, mostly, as provinces buy this electricity

09:59.820 --> 10:02.660
as capacity insurance during peak surges.

10:02.660 --> 10:06.860
While flexible, interconnected, and national in theory, China's grid's still just more

10:06.860 --> 10:11.460
regional, rudimentary, and coal-oriented in practice.

10:11.460 --> 10:15.820
Up until today, China's grid has largely done enough to facilitate the nation's monumental

10:15.820 --> 10:20.460
rise, but as Chinese coal consumption, consumer standards, average temperatures, and weather

10:20.460 --> 10:27.420
variability rise too, the challenge will be keeping up—and in 2021, it didn't.

10:27.420 --> 10:31.100
Given the continued centrality of coal in China's energy mix, the move they took in

10:31.100 --> 10:36.820
the middle of 2020 was bold—they banned Australian coal.

10:36.820 --> 10:40.340
This move occurred in response to the Western nation's calls for an investigation into

10:40.340 --> 10:46.140
the origins of COVID-19, but up until that point, Australia supplied around half of China's

10:46.140 --> 10:47.140
imported coal.

10:47.140 --> 10:52.100
Still, as the world's largest coal producer by orders of magnitude, the ban on Australian

10:52.100 --> 10:57.460
coal, even when entering winter, could be managed—as long as it was the only challenge

10:57.460 --> 10:58.820
to manage.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.940
Next came 2021, and with it, the recovery.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.520
As China's strict quarantine and control measures virtually eliminated the COVID virus

11:05.520 --> 11:09.660
from its territory, construction and heavy industry roared back.

11:09.660 --> 11:13.700
While the sector signaled signs of life from the previously dormant Chinese economy, they

11:13.700 --> 11:18.780
also put pressure on the grid, as the first half of 2021 saw an 11% increase in coal demand

11:18.780 --> 11:21.740
from the year prior, and an 8% increase from 2019.

11:21.740 --> 11:26.860
But as business boomed, under the surface, cracks were beginning to show.

11:26.860 --> 11:32.260
While China was burning more coal than years prior, it was hardly producing any.

11:32.260 --> 11:38.940
Here, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China closed over 30 mines over land use violations,

11:38.940 --> 11:40.980
halting production for months.

11:40.980 --> 11:45.880
Here, in Shengxi, coal mines closed for over a month for safety inspections after a worker

11:45.880 --> 11:47.180
died in an accident.

11:47.180 --> 11:52.220
And at the same time domestic supply hit snags, so too did international.

11:52.220 --> 11:56.740
Indonesia, China's newest number one coal supplier, was hit by a heavy storm season

11:56.740 --> 11:59.060
that derailed its export coals.

11:59.060 --> 12:03.140
Heavy storms led to record flooding in Shengzhou, China too, requiring emergency reroutes of

12:03.140 --> 12:04.540
coal into Henan province.

12:04.540 --> 12:09.820
But the rain didn't last, and as 2021 progressed, much of China entered an intense drought which

12:09.820 --> 12:12.780
severely hampered hydroelectric production.

12:12.780 --> 12:18.700
All the while, global coal prices skyrocketed to over $200 per metric ton—four times its

12:18.700 --> 12:20.660
average from a year prior.

12:20.660 --> 12:24.220
Chinese mines struggled to produce, while Chinese power providers drained reserves to

12:24.220 --> 12:28.240
at least minimize their losses while producing for a higher cost than they could sell, then

12:28.240 --> 12:32.060
claimed they were going offline for maintenance to further mitigate their financial damage.

12:32.060 --> 12:36.200
While 20 separate provinces experienced some of the most significant rolling blackouts

12:36.200 --> 12:41.620
in decades, the global supply chain was thrown into further turmoil as producers were forced

12:41.620 --> 12:43.660
to cut back or shut down production.

12:43.660 --> 12:49.020
While the crisis passed, the bedrock of the nation's economy had been exposed as a brittle

12:49.020 --> 12:52.620
embarrassment of a system.

12:52.620 --> 12:55.860
China stuck between a rock and a hard place.

12:55.860 --> 13:00.740
The rock is the expectation, both domestic and international, of continued, tremendous

13:00.740 --> 13:07.860
economic growth, and the hard place is the unmitigated, escalating global climate crisis.

13:07.860 --> 13:10.500
China knows it needs to cut back.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.060
It knows this both because of the ironclad science of climate change, and because of

13:14.060 --> 13:16.420
its own practical experience.

13:16.420 --> 13:21.020
Less than a decade ago, China, and specifically Beijing, had some of the worst air quality

13:21.020 --> 13:23.580
in the world, and this wasn't merely unpleasant.

13:23.580 --> 13:29.140
While it's tough to accurately measure, researchers have attributed 1, 2, or 3,000

13:29.140 --> 13:34.020
excess deaths, not per year, but per day, to air pollution in China.

13:34.020 --> 13:38.100
The issue escalated to such a degree that international employers started awarding hazard

13:38.100 --> 13:42.700
pay to staff sent to the country to compensate for the very real health effects of simply

13:42.700 --> 13:44.740
existing in China.

13:44.740 --> 13:49.960
The largest single factor behind this tremendous air pollution was coal, both for power generation

13:49.960 --> 13:51.580
and household heating purposes.

13:51.580 --> 13:56.180
While in the decades since the country has made tremendous, unprecedentedly fast progress

13:56.180 --> 14:00.780
in improving its air quality, it's still far above World Health Organization targets,

14:00.780 --> 14:05.460
and is still the source of myriad excess deaths per year, but in this instance, China's

14:05.460 --> 14:09.400
air quality crisis served a demonstration to Beijing that its coal habit comes with

14:09.400 --> 14:12.580
a very real, very tangible cost.

14:12.580 --> 14:17.300
Simultaneously, the world recognizes it needs to tackle the climate crisis to avoid the

14:17.300 --> 14:23.060
worst future of unlivable temperatures, destructive sea level rise, and deadly superstorms.

14:23.060 --> 14:28.560
The world, and China itself, also recognize that China is, by an enormous margin, the

14:28.560 --> 14:32.820
single largest source of carbon emissions, responsible for more than double the CO2 than

14:32.820 --> 14:36.220
the US, even if per capita emissions are lower.

14:36.220 --> 14:42.540
And remember, its trendline looks like this—all eyes are on China to play its part.

14:42.540 --> 14:48.220
So, as the world descended on Glasgow for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference,

14:48.220 --> 14:50.260
China made a commitment.

14:50.260 --> 14:56.060
The nation would reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2060.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.860
This is aggressive.

14:57.860 --> 15:02.340
Japan said it will reach carbon neutrality 37 years after its carbon peak, the US is

15:02.340 --> 15:06.980
giving itself 43 years, and the EU a full 71.

15:06.980 --> 15:11.900
China is saying they'll do it in 30, despite the fact that their peak will be far higher

15:11.900 --> 15:12.900
than any others.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.720
But this is China.

15:14.720 --> 15:18.300
This is the country that committed to 50 years of Hong Kong autonomy.

15:18.300 --> 15:21.820
This is the country that said a mere 300 died in Tiananmen Square.

15:21.820 --> 15:25.500
This is the country that says all that's going on in Xinjiang is the lawful detention

15:25.500 --> 15:27.220
of Uyghur terrorists.

15:27.220 --> 15:30.380
Can any Chinese commitment be considered truthful?

15:30.380 --> 15:34.220
Well, when it comes to climate, it's possible.

15:34.220 --> 15:39.140
At the 2009 iteration of the UN Conference on Climate Change, China committed to reducing

15:39.140 --> 15:44.600
its carbon emissions per unit of GDP, a metric known as carbon intensity, by 45% relative

15:44.600 --> 15:47.380
to 2005 levels by 2020.

15:47.380 --> 15:53.340
Coming to the United Nations itself, China hit this three years early in 2017.

15:53.340 --> 15:58.840
At COP21 in Paris in 2015, the country committed to go even further and reduce carbon intensity

15:58.840 --> 16:05.260
by 65% relative to 2005 levels by 2030, and China still has every chance in the world

16:05.260 --> 16:06.260
to hit that.

16:06.260 --> 16:11.060
So that's to say, based on the past promises, maybe China actually will peak its emissions

16:11.060 --> 16:12.300
by 2030.

16:12.300 --> 16:17.260
But, back when originally setting its carbon intensity targets, the primary criticism among

16:17.260 --> 16:23.020
experts was that China was supposedly already on the path to hit 45% reduction by 2020.

16:23.020 --> 16:27.540
In fact, according to International Energy Agency data, the pace of decline actually

16:27.540 --> 16:32.900
slowed in the five years after the 2009 commitment, relative to the five years before.

16:32.900 --> 16:38.860
Again, carbon intensity is a measure of emissions per unit of GDP, not overall emissions, so

16:38.860 --> 16:43.240
a reduction in carbon intensity was to be expected as the country's economy started

16:43.240 --> 16:46.140
to shift from industrial to service-based.

16:46.140 --> 16:50.260
The new 2030 carbon peaking goal, however, is different.

16:50.260 --> 16:54.140
China is not currently on that path, and with just seven years left on the clock, it's

16:54.140 --> 16:56.540
getting hard to believe that it can get on that path.

16:56.540 --> 17:02.340
China's climate commitments came before its power crisis, and 2021 and 2022 have demonstrated

17:02.340 --> 17:04.580
where the nation's priorities lie.

17:04.580 --> 17:09.380
A majority of the world's planned future coal power plant construction is within China,

17:09.380 --> 17:15.300
and just last year, Beijing authorized another 370 million tons worth of coal production

17:15.300 --> 17:20.500
to go online, reversing their prior commitments to reduce the fossil fuel's production.

17:20.500 --> 17:25.180
Analysts and observers have also noted a marked tone shift among Chinese officials, more often

17:25.180 --> 17:29.220
bringing up the need for energy security in their transition towards renewables, and in

17:29.220 --> 17:34.380
December 2021, at China's annual Central Economic Work Conference, policymakers finally

17:34.380 --> 17:39.820
suggested what everyone else already knew—that there could be a delay in hitting their emissions

17:39.820 --> 17:43.240
targets as they focus on their economy.

17:43.240 --> 17:48.040
The economic story of China over the past decade has been this—a slow slide out of

17:48.040 --> 17:52.960
the era of record-setting GDP growth, placing pressure on the leaders whose power is undergirded

17:52.960 --> 17:55.720
by the continued march towards superpower status.

17:55.720 --> 18:00.960
But it's clearer than ever that China's GDP growth is tremendously linked to carbon

18:00.960 --> 18:07.040
output, and that carbon output has to stop—for the health of its own citizens, for the pressure

18:07.040 --> 18:11.220
placed by the international community, and for the pragmatic global realities of climate

18:11.220 --> 18:12.220
change.

18:12.220 --> 18:15.320
What's happening now is a tenuous dance.

18:15.320 --> 18:20.360
They can take one step forward on decarbonizing, but that relies on taking one step back on

18:20.360 --> 18:21.360
growth.

18:21.360 --> 18:25.220
They can take one step forward on growth, but that requires taking one step back on

18:25.220 --> 18:27.400
diplomatic stature.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.420
China can manage and mitigate, but at the end of the day, the past decade has borne

18:31.420 --> 18:36.880
out that renewables can't come soon enough, because soon enough, in China's eyes, is

18:36.880 --> 18:41.580
the pace of growth enabled only by low-cost, high-carbon energy.

18:41.580 --> 18:47.480
It's economy versus climate, social order versus public health, tomorrow versus the

18:47.480 --> 18:49.640
day after.

18:49.640 --> 18:54.000
Having met plenty of Wendover viewers, I know that there tends to be a bit of a type.

18:54.000 --> 18:59.020
Most of you are highly motivated people, continuously working towards a defined set of goals, whether

18:59.020 --> 19:01.800
they be personal, career, or a mix of both.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.320
So that means you're probably the type of person that values your time highly, and fills

19:05.320 --> 19:09.560
it up with work, passion, social activities, critical downtime, and more.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.860
So my question to you is, why waste your time at the grocery store?

19:13.860 --> 19:17.700
Planning meals, driving or walking to the store, searching through the aisles, waiting

19:17.700 --> 19:23.500
in line to check out—all that's unnecessary thanks to services like our sponsor, HelloFresh.

19:23.500 --> 19:27.800
Basically, HelloFresh is a meal kit that gives you all the upsides of home cooking without

19:27.800 --> 19:29.460
any of the downsides.

19:29.460 --> 19:32.900
You select what you want to eat from more than 30 weekly recipes, then a box arrives

19:32.900 --> 19:36.620
on your doorstep with all the ingredients and recipes you need to cook those meals.

19:36.620 --> 19:40.280
This cuts out all the boring bits—shopping and a lot of the prep—so you skip straight

19:40.280 --> 19:44.640
to cooking, and in about 30 minutes you have a delicious, fresh, home-cooked meal.

19:44.640 --> 19:48.760
This is all surprisingly affordable and fairly eco-friendly—getting the exact right amount

19:48.760 --> 19:53.160
of ingredients cuts food waste down by 25%, and a University of Michigan study found that

19:53.160 --> 19:56.900
their streamlined supply chain means the carbon emissions of a HelloFresh meal are actually

19:56.900 --> 19:59.640
lower than that of an equivalent bought through a grocery store.

19:59.640 --> 20:03.800
I've used HelloFresh since 2020, before they even became a channel sponsor, and have

20:03.800 --> 20:07.580
made hundreds of delicious meals through them like these bulgogi meatballs.

20:07.580 --> 20:10.900
I'd really recommend giving them a try, as they could completely transform the way

20:10.900 --> 20:14.820
you eat, especially since you can click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and

20:14.820 --> 20:18.660
