0	2940	China… has a problem.
2940	6240	The country's getting hotter, and it's getting wealthier.
6240	11400	While in isolation one is a global challenge and the other a domestic triumph, in concert
11400	15440	they present an issue because of this—the air conditioner.
15440	20000	Fix China on its latitudes and move it along the longitudes, and one can see that its size,
20000	24640	shape, and southerness is not all that different from the US's, and that reflects in its
24640	25640	climate.
25640	29960	Beijing's temperatures closely track with those of DC year-round, while Shanghai's
29960	31120	reflect those of Atlanta.
31120	35680	That's to say, China, like the US, is hot.
35680	39720	Much of the US developed in an era of air conditioning—Florida, Texas, and Arizona
39720	44700	had their biggest population influxes at a time when inside and out no longer correlated,
44700	49260	and this is a direct contributor to the fact that the US today has the highest electricity
49260	52480	consumption per capita of any major economy.
52480	57300	China's marching down the same path—two out of every five air conditioning units made
57300	60060	today are being sold to a Chinese person.
60060	65340	Simply put, as personal income grows, air conditioning use grows, and so on the hottest
65340	71580	of hottest days, some 50% of electricity consumption in China is now directly devoted to cooling
71580	76420	down buildings—and this is only a single instance of a broader phenomena.
76420	80340	Across the board, the exponential increase in electricity consumption as nations grow
80340	84300	wealthier is a well-accepted and well-documented phenomena.
84300	88580	Other prosperous regions have found a tenuous equilibrium between wealth gains and efficiency
88580	89580	gains.
89580	93420	Europe and the US's year-over-year electricity consumptions have more or less plateaued,
93420	98860	but China's looks like this—it's just growing, and growing, and growing.
98860	104360	And most crucially, no country the size of China has ever, in history, developed at the
104360	105860	speed of China.
105860	111460	Its people are marching up the wealth pyramid at an unprecedented pace, and so too, of course,
111460	113580	is its electricity consumption.
113580	116300	This has led to difficulties.
116300	119660	China's no stranger to the occasional power crunch.
119660	123220	In a rapidly growing economy, these effectively represent growing pains.
123220	128760	But the power crunch across China in September and October of 2021 was different.
128760	133160	As in other periods of unseasonably high temperatures, power-strapped grid operators accounted for
133160	136820	an uptick in air conditioning and fans by cutting streetlights and other municipal power
136820	138720	uses they could live without.
138720	142820	Then they placed cuts on industrial users, notifying manufacturers and suppliers for
142820	146340	the likes of Tesla and Apple that factory operations would have to slow for the coming
146340	147340	week or two.
147340	150640	While the move put a damper on the Chinese economy rallying for the first time since
150640	156040	pandemic shutdowns, a temporary slowdown wouldn't be a major issue in the grand scheme of things.
156040	157360	Then it got worse.
157360	161820	Scorching droughts persisted across central China, winds unexpectedly died in the north,
161820	166380	and across the entire country, coal reserves dwindled to a day or two's worth.
166380	170060	Suddenly, the power crunch became rolling blackouts.
170060	173900	For hours, Chinese cities went dark.
173900	178100	In Laoyang, cars stacked up when traffic lights shut off, and metal workers ended up in the
178100	181060	hospital when factory exhaust systems shut down.
181060	185740	Shops ran by candlelight, city advised residents to stock up on clean water, building managers
185740	189660	asked tenants to take the stairs, while at least one family got stuck in an elevator
189660	191720	when power suddenly cut out.
191720	196800	The international media called it unprecedented, and some Chinese citizens compared the outages
196800	199180	to living in North Korea.
199180	203260	To understand the true source of the crisis, beyond the short-term, simple supply and demand
203260	207860	imbalance, one must understand China's electric grid, and to understand its grid, one must
207860	212840	understand this—coal is everything.
212840	218520	The two other areas with similar GDPs, Europe and the US, produce about 18 and 21% of their
218520	220920	electricity with coal, respectively.
220920	223920	In China, it's 62%.
223920	229740	In fact, about half of the entire world's coal power generation capacity is within the
229740	231240	People's Republic.
231240	236420	In context, this isn't surprising—two or three decades ago, coal was far more significant
236420	240260	in Europe and the US's energy mix, but in the years since, there's been a notable
240260	244680	shift towards cleaner, more flexible, natural gas-fired power plants.
244680	247020	China couldn't do that, at least not easily.
247020	250980	One of the country's critical weaknesses in today's world is that it lacks significant
250980	252940	domestic oil and gas production.
252960	257280	It imports about half of the natural gas it uses, which means it's expensive, which
257280	262080	means it doesn't use the fossil fuel for generating electricity, at least in any significant
262080	263080	way.
263080	266160	Meanwhile, China is swimming in coal.
266160	271080	Enormous deposits sit in Inner Mongolia and the Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces—the country
271080	276120	has more natural coal deposits than anyone but Russia, Australia, and the US.
276120	280640	Many forms of renewable electricity generation are now cost-competitive with coal and gas
280640	288380	generation, but remember, China has been growing unbelievably, unprecedentedly fast.
288380	292820	While the overall cost per kilowatt-hour of solar, for example, might be the same or lower
292820	297280	than that of coal power, there's the question of when the money is spent.
297280	302640	With solar, nearly all of the cost is upfront in the production and installation of panels.
302640	307340	With coal, however, the cost is more distributed through the lifetime of use—there's a
307340	311560	lower initial installation cost per unit of capacity—but it raises through time,
311560	315380	with use, as coal has to be purchased to keep the generation ongoing.
315380	320000	So when a country is growing at such a pace, it's much easier to spend less upfront to
320000	324820	add capacity, knowing that more money is coming, rather than spend a larger amount upfront
324820	326620	knowing the savings will come later.
326620	331340	It's that simple reality that has undergirded the centrality of coal in China's energy
331340	332340	mix.
332340	338180	Now, the companies actually producing power in China are, almost universally, state-owned
338180	342220	enterprises, but despite reporting up to the central government, on a day-to-day basis,
342220	346440	these businesses do act with a certain degree of autonomy, responding to market conditions
346440	351660	similar to how a privately-owned enterprise would—but this is a unique market.
351660	356040	Beijing regulates how much power producers get paid for the electricity they make—typically
356040	360280	it hovers around 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, far below the world average.
360280	365900	The country considers this crucial because, still today, it's a largely industrial economy.
365900	369040	Industry requires power, and just as China is competitive with the rest of the world
369040	373240	thanks to its low labor costs, it's also competitive thanks to its low electricity
373240	378560	costs—but low costs mean nothing if there's no electricity to be consumed.
378560	385080	Notably, and crucially, Beijing does not regulate the cost of coal—it fluctuates wildly up
385080	388160	and down, just as it does in the rest of the world.
388160	394520	So companies get paid a fixed amount for what they make, but their input cost—the coal—changes.
394520	398600	It doesn't take an expert to spot the potential issue with this.
398600	400680	So why not renewables?
400680	405240	Ignoring for the moment the difficulties in upfront financing, if solar and wind are competitive
405240	410040	in cost with coal-fired power and aren't vulnerable to the short-term up-and-down fluctuations
410040	412800	in coal prices, wouldn't they be the clear winner?
412800	416840	Wouldn't a solar installation producing for less than 8 cents per kilowatt-hour be
416840	419400	a guaranteed profit machine?
419400	421680	Yes, but…
421680	427240	Most Chinese people live where favorable conditions for renewable energy simply aren't.
427240	431560	The country's greatest solar energy potential lies largely in the arid west and along the
431560	432980	northern border.
432980	436920	The same goes for wind—these regions in the far west and borderland north are also
436920	439760	where the nation's most consistent wind potentials lie.
439760	445040	The difficulty is, more than 90% of China's population resides on the southeast side of
445040	449100	this divide—far from the most productive areas for renewables.
449100	452680	Even when it comes to the nation's most heavily developed renewable, hydropower, many
452680	456840	of the nation's largest dams are located in southern and southwestern China—near
456840	461560	moderately populated areas, but still far from the most densely populated provinces.
461560	465240	Making the most of renewable resources, and the already impressive amount of renewable
465240	469160	infrastructure the central government has built out then, requires efficient means of
469160	475680	transferring electricity over vast distances and a flexible, interconnected grid.
475680	479600	Alongside the massive dams, solar installations, and wind farms China's taken on in the past
479600	483900	decade is an equally impressive assortment of transmission lines, increasingly connecting
483900	488360	the sunny, windswept hinterlands to population and industrial centers.
488360	492920	This is an ultra-high voltage power line, and of the 36 that exist globally, China's
492920	496000	home to 34 of them, with plans to build more.
496000	500640	While standard overhead transmission lines run from 110 to 500 kilovolts, these run from
500640	506420	800 to 1100, resulting in massive efficiency gains, and in turn, allowing these long-distance
506420	509860	lines to move up to five times the power of a standard line.
509860	513880	In China, they've been identified as the key to linking areas of high energy consumption
513880	516440	with areas of high renewable production.
516440	520280	And yet, while these infrastructure investments have built out wind and solar plants in remote
520280	524480	areas as far east as the deserts of Xinjiang, then connected them directly to industrial
524480	529920	centers like the Yanhui province, 2,000 miles or 3,200 kilometers away, China has yet to
529920	532040	make the most out of their green investments.
532040	536280	At the end of 2020, a report surfaced that China's future forward ultra-high voltage
536280	540280	lines were only running at a paltry 60% of capacity.
540280	545600	For a country with a still-climbing coal habit, this dramatic underutilization was disappointing,
545600	550480	but not necessarily an indictment of the physical grid—rather, an indictment of how China's
550480	552720	grid works on a policy and pricing level.
553120	555680	China has yet to properly incentivize their renewables.
555680	559200	They've addressed the supply side, but largely ignored demand.
559200	563320	Critical to the full implementation of China's solar and wind farms and the power lines connecting
563320	568040	them to population centers is the willingness of Chinese provinces to buy energy from one
568040	569200	another.
569200	573080	Because energy rates are set by the government rather than a market, provinces, which are
573080	576920	largely in charge of their own grids, have prioritized purchasing electricity within
576920	581500	their own borders, regardless of its origin, to keep the money local.
581500	584180	Why give another province the work that could exist within?
584180	588500	And because the provinces that need more power are more densely populated or more industrialized,
588500	592680	they're probably eastern or coastal, and likely buying power from nearby coal plants
592680	595220	rather than out-of-province renewables.
595220	599820	Available renewables then take a back seat—they get used, mostly, as provinces buy this electricity
599820	602660	as capacity insurance during peak surges.
602660	606860	While flexible, interconnected, and national in theory, China's grid's still just more
606860	611460	regional, rudimentary, and coal-oriented in practice.
611460	615820	Up until today, China's grid has largely done enough to facilitate the nation's monumental
615820	620460	rise, but as Chinese coal consumption, consumer standards, average temperatures, and weather
620460	627420	variability rise too, the challenge will be keeping up—and in 2021, it didn't.
627420	631100	Given the continued centrality of coal in China's energy mix, the move they took in
631100	636820	the middle of 2020 was bold—they banned Australian coal.
636820	640340	This move occurred in response to the Western nation's calls for an investigation into
640340	646140	the origins of COVID-19, but up until that point, Australia supplied around half of China's
646140	647140	imported coal.
647140	652100	Still, as the world's largest coal producer by orders of magnitude, the ban on Australian
652100	657460	coal, even when entering winter, could be managed—as long as it was the only challenge
657460	658820	to manage.
658820	661940	Next came 2021, and with it, the recovery.
661940	665520	As China's strict quarantine and control measures virtually eliminated the COVID virus
665520	669660	from its territory, construction and heavy industry roared back.
669660	673700	While the sector signaled signs of life from the previously dormant Chinese economy, they
673700	678780	also put pressure on the grid, as the first half of 2021 saw an 11% increase in coal demand
678780	681740	from the year prior, and an 8% increase from 2019.
681740	686860	But as business boomed, under the surface, cracks were beginning to show.
686860	692260	While China was burning more coal than years prior, it was hardly producing any.
692260	698940	Here, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China closed over 30 mines over land use violations,
698940	700980	halting production for months.
700980	705880	Here, in Shengxi, coal mines closed for over a month for safety inspections after a worker
705880	707180	died in an accident.
707180	712220	And at the same time domestic supply hit snags, so too did international.
712220	716740	Indonesia, China's newest number one coal supplier, was hit by a heavy storm season
716740	719060	that derailed its export coals.
719060	723140	Heavy storms led to record flooding in Shengzhou, China too, requiring emergency reroutes of
723140	724540	coal into Henan province.
724540	729820	But the rain didn't last, and as 2021 progressed, much of China entered an intense drought which
729820	732780	severely hampered hydroelectric production.
732780	738700	All the while, global coal prices skyrocketed to over $200 per metric ton—four times its
738700	740660	average from a year prior.
740660	744220	Chinese mines struggled to produce, while Chinese power providers drained reserves to
744220	748240	at least minimize their losses while producing for a higher cost than they could sell, then
748240	752060	claimed they were going offline for maintenance to further mitigate their financial damage.
752060	756200	While 20 separate provinces experienced some of the most significant rolling blackouts
756200	761620	in decades, the global supply chain was thrown into further turmoil as producers were forced
761620	763660	to cut back or shut down production.
763660	769020	While the crisis passed, the bedrock of the nation's economy had been exposed as a brittle
769020	772620	embarrassment of a system.
772620	775860	China stuck between a rock and a hard place.
775860	780740	The rock is the expectation, both domestic and international, of continued, tremendous
780740	787860	economic growth, and the hard place is the unmitigated, escalating global climate crisis.
787860	790500	China knows it needs to cut back.
790500	794060	It knows this both because of the ironclad science of climate change, and because of
794060	796420	its own practical experience.
796420	801020	Less than a decade ago, China, and specifically Beijing, had some of the worst air quality
801020	803580	in the world, and this wasn't merely unpleasant.
803580	809140	While it's tough to accurately measure, researchers have attributed 1, 2, or 3,000
809140	814020	excess deaths, not per year, but per day, to air pollution in China.
814020	818100	The issue escalated to such a degree that international employers started awarding hazard
818100	822700	pay to staff sent to the country to compensate for the very real health effects of simply
822700	824740	existing in China.
824740	829960	The largest single factor behind this tremendous air pollution was coal, both for power generation
829960	831580	and household heating purposes.
831580	836180	While in the decades since the country has made tremendous, unprecedentedly fast progress
836180	840780	in improving its air quality, it's still far above World Health Organization targets,
840780	845460	and is still the source of myriad excess deaths per year, but in this instance, China's
845460	849400	air quality crisis served a demonstration to Beijing that its coal habit comes with
849400	852580	a very real, very tangible cost.
852580	857300	Simultaneously, the world recognizes it needs to tackle the climate crisis to avoid the
857300	863060	worst future of unlivable temperatures, destructive sea level rise, and deadly superstorms.
863060	868560	The world, and China itself, also recognize that China is, by an enormous margin, the
868560	872820	single largest source of carbon emissions, responsible for more than double the CO2 than
872820	876220	the US, even if per capita emissions are lower.
876220	882540	And remember, its trendline looks like this—all eyes are on China to play its part.
882540	888220	So, as the world descended on Glasgow for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference,
888220	890260	China made a commitment.
890260	896060	The nation would reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2060.
896060	897860	This is aggressive.
897860	902340	Japan said it will reach carbon neutrality 37 years after its carbon peak, the US is
902340	906980	giving itself 43 years, and the EU a full 71.
906980	911900	China is saying they'll do it in 30, despite the fact that their peak will be far higher
911900	912900	than any others.
912900	914720	But this is China.
914720	918300	This is the country that committed to 50 years of Hong Kong autonomy.
918300	921820	This is the country that said a mere 300 died in Tiananmen Square.
921820	925500	This is the country that says all that's going on in Xinjiang is the lawful detention
925500	927220	of Uyghur terrorists.
927220	930380	Can any Chinese commitment be considered truthful?
930380	934220	Well, when it comes to climate, it's possible.
934220	939140	At the 2009 iteration of the UN Conference on Climate Change, China committed to reducing
939140	944600	its carbon emissions per unit of GDP, a metric known as carbon intensity, by 45% relative
944600	947380	to 2005 levels by 2020.
947380	953340	Coming to the United Nations itself, China hit this three years early in 2017.
953340	958840	At COP21 in Paris in 2015, the country committed to go even further and reduce carbon intensity
958840	965260	by 65% relative to 2005 levels by 2030, and China still has every chance in the world
965260	966260	to hit that.
966260	971060	So that's to say, based on the past promises, maybe China actually will peak its emissions
971060	972300	by 2030.
972300	977260	But, back when originally setting its carbon intensity targets, the primary criticism among
977260	983020	experts was that China was supposedly already on the path to hit 45% reduction by 2020.
983020	987540	In fact, according to International Energy Agency data, the pace of decline actually
987540	992900	slowed in the five years after the 2009 commitment, relative to the five years before.
992900	998860	Again, carbon intensity is a measure of emissions per unit of GDP, not overall emissions, so
998860	1003240	a reduction in carbon intensity was to be expected as the country's economy started
1003240	1006140	to shift from industrial to service-based.
1006140	1010260	The new 2030 carbon peaking goal, however, is different.
1010260	1014140	China is not currently on that path, and with just seven years left on the clock, it's
1014140	1016540	getting hard to believe that it can get on that path.
1016540	1022340	China's climate commitments came before its power crisis, and 2021 and 2022 have demonstrated
1022340	1024580	where the nation's priorities lie.
1024580	1029380	A majority of the world's planned future coal power plant construction is within China,
1029380	1035300	and just last year, Beijing authorized another 370 million tons worth of coal production
1035300	1040500	to go online, reversing their prior commitments to reduce the fossil fuel's production.
1040500	1045180	Analysts and observers have also noted a marked tone shift among Chinese officials, more often
1045180	1049220	bringing up the need for energy security in their transition towards renewables, and in
1049220	1054380	December 2021, at China's annual Central Economic Work Conference, policymakers finally
1054380	1059820	suggested what everyone else already knew—that there could be a delay in hitting their emissions
1059820	1063240	targets as they focus on their economy.
1063240	1068040	The economic story of China over the past decade has been this—a slow slide out of
1068040	1072960	the era of record-setting GDP growth, placing pressure on the leaders whose power is undergirded
1072960	1075720	by the continued march towards superpower status.
1075720	1080960	But it's clearer than ever that China's GDP growth is tremendously linked to carbon
1080960	1087040	output, and that carbon output has to stop—for the health of its own citizens, for the pressure
1087040	1091220	placed by the international community, and for the pragmatic global realities of climate
1091220	1092220	change.
1092220	1095320	What's happening now is a tenuous dance.
1095320	1100360	They can take one step forward on decarbonizing, but that relies on taking one step back on
1100360	1101360	growth.
1101360	1105220	They can take one step forward on growth, but that requires taking one step back on
1105220	1107400	diplomatic stature.
1107400	1111420	China can manage and mitigate, but at the end of the day, the past decade has borne
1111420	1116880	out that renewables can't come soon enough, because soon enough, in China's eyes, is
1116880	1121580	the pace of growth enabled only by low-cost, high-carbon energy.
1121580	1127480	It's economy versus climate, social order versus public health, tomorrow versus the
1127480	1129640	day after.
1129640	1134000	Having met plenty of Wendover viewers, I know that there tends to be a bit of a type.
1134000	1139020	Most of you are highly motivated people, continuously working towards a defined set of goals, whether
1139020	1141800	they be personal, career, or a mix of both.
1141800	1145320	So that means you're probably the type of person that values your time highly, and fills
1145320	1149560	it up with work, passion, social activities, critical downtime, and more.
1149560	1153860	So my question to you is, why waste your time at the grocery store?
1153860	1157700	Planning meals, driving or walking to the store, searching through the aisles, waiting
1157700	1163500	in line to check out—all that's unnecessary thanks to services like our sponsor, HelloFresh.

1167800	1169460	any of the downsides.

1196900	1199640	lower than that of an equivalent bought through a grocery store.
1199640	1203800	I've used HelloFresh since 2020, before they even became a channel sponsor, and have
