1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
China… has a problem.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,240
The country's getting hotter, and it's getting wealthier.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,400
While in isolation one is a global challenge and the other a domestic triumph, in concert

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,440
they present an issue because of this—the air conditioner.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,000
Fix China on its latitudes and move it along the longitudes, and one can see that its size,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
shape, and southerness is not all that different from the US's, and that reflects in its

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
climate.

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,960
Beijing's temperatures closely track with those of DC year-round, while Shanghai's

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,120
reflect those of Atlanta.

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,680
That's to say, China, like the US, is hot.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,720
Much of the US developed in an era of air conditioning—Florida, Texas, and Arizona

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,700
had their biggest population influxes at a time when inside and out no longer correlated,

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,260
and this is a direct contributor to the fact that the US today has the highest electricity

14
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,480
consumption per capita of any major economy.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,300
China's marching down the same path—two out of every five air conditioning units made

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,060
today are being sold to a Chinese person.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,340
Simply put, as personal income grows, air conditioning use grows, and so on the hottest

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,580
of hottest days, some 50% of electricity consumption in China is now directly devoted to cooling

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,420
down buildings—and this is only a single instance of a broader phenomena.

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,340
Across the board, the exponential increase in electricity consumption as nations grow

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,300
wealthier is a well-accepted and well-documented phenomena.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,580
Other prosperous regions have found a tenuous equilibrium between wealth gains and efficiency

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
gains.

24
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,420
Europe and the US's year-over-year electricity consumptions have more or less plateaued,

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,860
but China's looks like this—it's just growing, and growing, and growing.

26
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,360
And most crucially, no country the size of China has ever, in history, developed at the

27
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,860
speed of China.

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,460
Its people are marching up the wealth pyramid at an unprecedented pace, and so too, of course,

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,580
is its electricity consumption.

30
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,300
This has led to difficulties.

31
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,660
China's no stranger to the occasional power crunch.

32
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,220
In a rapidly growing economy, these effectively represent growing pains.

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,760
But the power crunch across China in September and October of 2021 was different.

34
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,160
As in other periods of unseasonably high temperatures, power-strapped grid operators accounted for

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,820
an uptick in air conditioning and fans by cutting streetlights and other municipal power

36
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,720
uses they could live without.

37
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,820
Then they placed cuts on industrial users, notifying manufacturers and suppliers for

38
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,340
the likes of Tesla and Apple that factory operations would have to slow for the coming

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
week or two.

40
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,640
While the move put a damper on the Chinese economy rallying for the first time since

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,040
pandemic shutdowns, a temporary slowdown wouldn't be a major issue in the grand scheme of things.

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,360
Then it got worse.

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,820
Scorching droughts persisted across central China, winds unexpectedly died in the north,

44
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,380
and across the entire country, coal reserves dwindled to a day or two's worth.

45
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,060
Suddenly, the power crunch became rolling blackouts.

46
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,900
For hours, Chinese cities went dark.

47
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,100
In Laoyang, cars stacked up when traffic lights shut off, and metal workers ended up in the

48
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,060
hospital when factory exhaust systems shut down.

49
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,740
Shops ran by candlelight, city advised residents to stock up on clean water, building managers

50
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,660
asked tenants to take the stairs, while at least one family got stuck in an elevator

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,720
when power suddenly cut out.

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,800
The international media called it unprecedented, and some Chinese citizens compared the outages

53
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,180
to living in North Korea.

54
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,260
To understand the true source of the crisis, beyond the short-term, simple supply and demand

55
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,860
imbalance, one must understand China's electric grid, and to understand its grid, one must

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,840
understand this—coal is everything.

57
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,520
The two other areas with similar GDPs, Europe and the US, produce about 18 and 21% of their

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,920
electricity with coal, respectively.

59
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
In China, it's 62%.

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,740
In fact, about half of the entire world's coal power generation capacity is within the

61
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,240
People's Republic.

62
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,420
In context, this isn't surprising—two or three decades ago, coal was far more significant

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,260
in Europe and the US's energy mix, but in the years since, there's been a notable

64
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,680
shift towards cleaner, more flexible, natural gas-fired power plants.

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,020
China couldn't do that, at least not easily.

66
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,980
One of the country's critical weaknesses in today's world is that it lacks significant

67
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,940
domestic oil and gas production.

68
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,280
It imports about half of the natural gas it uses, which means it's expensive, which

69
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,080
means it doesn't use the fossil fuel for generating electricity, at least in any significant

70
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
way.

71
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,160
Meanwhile, China is swimming in coal.

72
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,080
Enormous deposits sit in Inner Mongolia and the Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces—the country

73
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,120
has more natural coal deposits than anyone but Russia, Australia, and the US.

74
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,640
Many forms of renewable electricity generation are now cost-competitive with coal and gas

75
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:48,380
generation, but remember, China has been growing unbelievably, unprecedentedly fast.

76
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:52,820
While the overall cost per kilowatt-hour of solar, for example, might be the same or lower

77
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,280
than that of coal power, there's the question of when the money is spent.

78
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,640
With solar, nearly all of the cost is upfront in the production and installation of panels.

79
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,340
With coal, however, the cost is more distributed through the lifetime of use—there's a

80
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,560
lower initial installation cost per unit of capacity—but it raises through time,

81
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,380
with use, as coal has to be purchased to keep the generation ongoing.

82
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,000
So when a country is growing at such a pace, it's much easier to spend less upfront to

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,820
add capacity, knowing that more money is coming, rather than spend a larger amount upfront

84
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,620
knowing the savings will come later.

85
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,340
It's that simple reality that has undergirded the centrality of coal in China's energy

86
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
mix.

87
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,180
Now, the companies actually producing power in China are, almost universally, state-owned

88
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,220
enterprises, but despite reporting up to the central government, on a day-to-day basis,

89
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,440
these businesses do act with a certain degree of autonomy, responding to market conditions

90
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,660
similar to how a privately-owned enterprise would—but this is a unique market.

91
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,040
Beijing regulates how much power producers get paid for the electricity they make—typically

92
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,280
it hovers around 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, far below the world average.

93
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,900
The country considers this crucial because, still today, it's a largely industrial economy.

94
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,040
Industry requires power, and just as China is competitive with the rest of the world

95
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,240
thanks to its low labor costs, it's also competitive thanks to its low electricity

96
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,560
costs—but low costs mean nothing if there's no electricity to be consumed.

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,080
Notably, and crucially, Beijing does not regulate the cost of coal—it fluctuates wildly up

98
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,160
and down, just as it does in the rest of the world.

99
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,520
So companies get paid a fixed amount for what they make, but their input cost—the coal—changes.

100
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,600
It doesn't take an expert to spot the potential issue with this.

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,680
So why not renewables?

102
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,240
Ignoring for the moment the difficulties in upfront financing, if solar and wind are competitive

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,040
in cost with coal-fired power and aren't vulnerable to the short-term up-and-down fluctuations

104
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,800
in coal prices, wouldn't they be the clear winner?

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,840
Wouldn't a solar installation producing for less than 8 cents per kilowatt-hour be

106
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,400
a guaranteed profit machine?

107
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Yes, but…

108
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,240
Most Chinese people live where favorable conditions for renewable energy simply aren't.

109
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,560
The country's greatest solar energy potential lies largely in the arid west and along the

110
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,980
northern border.

111
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,920
The same goes for wind—these regions in the far west and borderland north are also

112
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,760
where the nation's most consistent wind potentials lie.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,040
The difficulty is, more than 90% of China's population resides on the southeast side of

114
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,100
this divide—far from the most productive areas for renewables.

115
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,680
Even when it comes to the nation's most heavily developed renewable, hydropower, many

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,840
of the nation's largest dams are located in southern and southwestern China—near

117
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:41,560
moderately populated areas, but still far from the most densely populated provinces.

118
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,240
Making the most of renewable resources, and the already impressive amount of renewable

119
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,160
infrastructure the central government has built out then, requires efficient means of

120
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,680
transferring electricity over vast distances and a flexible, interconnected grid.

121
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,600
Alongside the massive dams, solar installations, and wind farms China's taken on in the past

122
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,900
decade is an equally impressive assortment of transmission lines, increasingly connecting

123
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,360
the sunny, windswept hinterlands to population and industrial centers.

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,920
This is an ultra-high voltage power line, and of the 36 that exist globally, China's

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,000
home to 34 of them, with plans to build more.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,640
While standard overhead transmission lines run from 110 to 500 kilovolts, these run from

127
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,420
800 to 1100, resulting in massive efficiency gains, and in turn, allowing these long-distance

128
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,860
lines to move up to five times the power of a standard line.

129
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,880
In China, they've been identified as the key to linking areas of high energy consumption

130
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,440
with areas of high renewable production.

131
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,280
And yet, while these infrastructure investments have built out wind and solar plants in remote

132
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,480
areas as far east as the deserts of Xinjiang, then connected them directly to industrial

133
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,920
centers like the Yanhui province, 2,000 miles or 3,200 kilometers away, China has yet to

134
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,040
make the most out of their green investments.

135
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,280
At the end of 2020, a report surfaced that China's future forward ultra-high voltage

136
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,280
lines were only running at a paltry 60% of capacity.

137
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,600
For a country with a still-climbing coal habit, this dramatic underutilization was disappointing,

138
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,480
but not necessarily an indictment of the physical grid—rather, an indictment of how China's

139
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,720
grid works on a policy and pricing level.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,680
China has yet to properly incentivize their renewables.

141
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,200
They've addressed the supply side, but largely ignored demand.

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,320
Critical to the full implementation of China's solar and wind farms and the power lines connecting

143
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,040
them to population centers is the willingness of Chinese provinces to buy energy from one

144
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,200
another.

145
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,080
Because energy rates are set by the government rather than a market, provinces, which are

146
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,920
largely in charge of their own grids, have prioritized purchasing electricity within

147
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,500
their own borders, regardless of its origin, to keep the money local.

148
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,180
Why give another province the work that could exist within?

149
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,500
And because the provinces that need more power are more densely populated or more industrialized,

150
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,680
they're probably eastern or coastal, and likely buying power from nearby coal plants

151
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,220
rather than out-of-province renewables.

152
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,820
Available renewables then take a back seat—they get used, mostly, as provinces buy this electricity

153
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,660
as capacity insurance during peak surges.

154
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,860
While flexible, interconnected, and national in theory, China's grid's still just more

155
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,460
regional, rudimentary, and coal-oriented in practice.

156
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,820
Up until today, China's grid has largely done enough to facilitate the nation's monumental

157
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,460
rise, but as Chinese coal consumption, consumer standards, average temperatures, and weather

158
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:27,420
variability rise too, the challenge will be keeping up—and in 2021, it didn't.

159
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,100
Given the continued centrality of coal in China's energy mix, the move they took in

160
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,820
the middle of 2020 was bold—they banned Australian coal.

161
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,340
This move occurred in response to the Western nation's calls for an investigation into

162
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,140
the origins of COVID-19, but up until that point, Australia supplied around half of China's

163
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,140
imported coal.

164
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,100
Still, as the world's largest coal producer by orders of magnitude, the ban on Australian

165
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,460
coal, even when entering winter, could be managed—as long as it was the only challenge

166
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,820
to manage.

167
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,940
Next came 2021, and with it, the recovery.

168
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,520
As China's strict quarantine and control measures virtually eliminated the COVID virus

169
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,660
from its territory, construction and heavy industry roared back.

170
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,700
While the sector signaled signs of life from the previously dormant Chinese economy, they

171
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,780
also put pressure on the grid, as the first half of 2021 saw an 11% increase in coal demand

172
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,740
from the year prior, and an 8% increase from 2019.

173
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,860
But as business boomed, under the surface, cracks were beginning to show.

174
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,260
While China was burning more coal than years prior, it was hardly producing any.

175
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,940
Here, in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China closed over 30 mines over land use violations,

176
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,980
halting production for months.

177
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,880
Here, in Shengxi, coal mines closed for over a month for safety inspections after a worker

178
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,180
died in an accident.

179
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,220
And at the same time domestic supply hit snags, so too did international.

180
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,740
Indonesia, China's newest number one coal supplier, was hit by a heavy storm season

181
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,060
that derailed its export coals.

182
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,140
Heavy storms led to record flooding in Shengzhou, China too, requiring emergency reroutes of

183
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,540
coal into Henan province.

184
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:09,820
But the rain didn't last, and as 2021 progressed, much of China entered an intense drought which

185
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,780
severely hampered hydroelectric production.

186
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:18,700
All the while, global coal prices skyrocketed to over $200 per metric ton—four times its

187
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,660
average from a year prior.

188
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,220
Chinese mines struggled to produce, while Chinese power providers drained reserves to

189
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,240
at least minimize their losses while producing for a higher cost than they could sell, then

190
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,060
claimed they were going offline for maintenance to further mitigate their financial damage.

191
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:36,200
While 20 separate provinces experienced some of the most significant rolling blackouts

192
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,620
in decades, the global supply chain was thrown into further turmoil as producers were forced

193
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,660
to cut back or shut down production.

194
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,020
While the crisis passed, the bedrock of the nation's economy had been exposed as a brittle

195
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,620
embarrassment of a system.

196
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,860
China stuck between a rock and a hard place.

197
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,740
The rock is the expectation, both domestic and international, of continued, tremendous

198
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,860
economic growth, and the hard place is the unmitigated, escalating global climate crisis.

199
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,500
China knows it needs to cut back.

200
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,060
It knows this both because of the ironclad science of climate change, and because of

201
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,420
its own practical experience.

202
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,020
Less than a decade ago, China, and specifically Beijing, had some of the worst air quality

203
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,580
in the world, and this wasn't merely unpleasant.

204
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:29,140
While it's tough to accurately measure, researchers have attributed 1, 2, or 3,000

205
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,020
excess deaths, not per year, but per day, to air pollution in China.

206
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,100
The issue escalated to such a degree that international employers started awarding hazard

207
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,700
pay to staff sent to the country to compensate for the very real health effects of simply

208
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,740
existing in China.

209
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,960
The largest single factor behind this tremendous air pollution was coal, both for power generation

210
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,580
and household heating purposes.

211
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,180
While in the decades since the country has made tremendous, unprecedentedly fast progress

212
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,780
in improving its air quality, it's still far above World Health Organization targets,

213
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,460
and is still the source of myriad excess deaths per year, but in this instance, China's

214
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,400
air quality crisis served a demonstration to Beijing that its coal habit comes with

215
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,580
a very real, very tangible cost.

216
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,300
Simultaneously, the world recognizes it needs to tackle the climate crisis to avoid the

217
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,060
worst future of unlivable temperatures, destructive sea level rise, and deadly superstorms.

218
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,560
The world, and China itself, also recognize that China is, by an enormous margin, the

219
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,820
single largest source of carbon emissions, responsible for more than double the CO2 than

220
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,220
the US, even if per capita emissions are lower.

221
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:42,540
And remember, its trendline looks like this—all eyes are on China to play its part.

222
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,220
So, as the world descended on Glasgow for the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference,

223
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,260
China made a commitment.

224
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:56,060
The nation would reach peak carbon emissions by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2060.

225
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,860
This is aggressive.

226
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,340
Japan said it will reach carbon neutrality 37 years after its carbon peak, the US is

227
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:06,980
giving itself 43 years, and the EU a full 71.

228
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,900
China is saying they'll do it in 30, despite the fact that their peak will be far higher

229
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,900
than any others.

230
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,720
But this is China.

231
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,300
This is the country that committed to 50 years of Hong Kong autonomy.

232
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,820
This is the country that said a mere 300 died in Tiananmen Square.

233
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,500
This is the country that says all that's going on in Xinjiang is the lawful detention

234
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,220
of Uyghur terrorists.

235
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,380
Can any Chinese commitment be considered truthful?

236
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,220
Well, when it comes to climate, it's possible.

237
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,140
At the 2009 iteration of the UN Conference on Climate Change, China committed to reducing

238
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:44,600
its carbon emissions per unit of GDP, a metric known as carbon intensity, by 45% relative

239
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,380
to 2005 levels by 2020.

240
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:53,340
Coming to the United Nations itself, China hit this three years early in 2017.

241
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,840
At COP21 in Paris in 2015, the country committed to go even further and reduce carbon intensity

242
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:05,260
by 65% relative to 2005 levels by 2030, and China still has every chance in the world

243
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
to hit that.

244
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,060
So that's to say, based on the past promises, maybe China actually will peak its emissions

245
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,300
by 2030.

246
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,260
But, back when originally setting its carbon intensity targets, the primary criticism among

247
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,020
experts was that China was supposedly already on the path to hit 45% reduction by 2020.

248
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,540
In fact, according to International Energy Agency data, the pace of decline actually

249
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,900
slowed in the five years after the 2009 commitment, relative to the five years before.

250
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,860
Again, carbon intensity is a measure of emissions per unit of GDP, not overall emissions, so

251
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,240
a reduction in carbon intensity was to be expected as the country's economy started

252
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,140
to shift from industrial to service-based.

253
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,260
The new 2030 carbon peaking goal, however, is different.

254
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,140
China is not currently on that path, and with just seven years left on the clock, it's

255
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,540
getting hard to believe that it can get on that path.

256
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:02,340
China's climate commitments came before its power crisis, and 2021 and 2022 have demonstrated

257
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:04,580
where the nation's priorities lie.

258
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:09,380
A majority of the world's planned future coal power plant construction is within China,

259
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,300
and just last year, Beijing authorized another 370 million tons worth of coal production

260
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,500
to go online, reversing their prior commitments to reduce the fossil fuel's production.

261
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,180
Analysts and observers have also noted a marked tone shift among Chinese officials, more often

262
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,220
bringing up the need for energy security in their transition towards renewables, and in

263
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,380
December 2021, at China's annual Central Economic Work Conference, policymakers finally

264
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,820
suggested what everyone else already knew—that there could be a delay in hitting their emissions

265
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,240
targets as they focus on their economy.

266
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,040
The economic story of China over the past decade has been this—a slow slide out of

267
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,960
the era of record-setting GDP growth, placing pressure on the leaders whose power is undergirded

268
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,720
by the continued march towards superpower status.

269
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,960
But it's clearer than ever that China's GDP growth is tremendously linked to carbon

270
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,040
output, and that carbon output has to stop—for the health of its own citizens, for the pressure

271
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,220
placed by the international community, and for the pragmatic global realities of climate

272
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,220
change.

273
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,320
What's happening now is a tenuous dance.

274
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,360
They can take one step forward on decarbonizing, but that relies on taking one step back on

275
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
growth.

276
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,220
They can take one step forward on growth, but that requires taking one step back on

277
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,400
diplomatic stature.

278
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,420
China can manage and mitigate, but at the end of the day, the past decade has borne

279
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,880
out that renewables can't come soon enough, because soon enough, in China's eyes, is

280
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,580
the pace of growth enabled only by low-cost, high-carbon energy.

281
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,480
It's economy versus climate, social order versus public health, tomorrow versus the

282
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,640
day after.

283
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:54,000
Having met plenty of Wendover viewers, I know that there tends to be a bit of a type.

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,020
Most of you are highly motivated people, continuously working towards a defined set of goals, whether

285
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,800
they be personal, career, or a mix of both.

286
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,320
So that means you're probably the type of person that values your time highly, and fills

287
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,560
it up with work, passion, social activities, critical downtime, and more.

288
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,860
So my question to you is, why waste your time at the grocery store?

289
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,700
Planning meals, driving or walking to the store, searching through the aisles, waiting

290
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,500
in line to check out—all that's unnecessary thanks to services like our sponsor, HelloFresh.

291
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,800
Basically, HelloFresh is a meal kit that gives you all the upsides of home cooking without

292
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,460
any of the downsides.

293
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,900
You select what you want to eat from more than 30 weekly recipes, then a box arrives

294
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,620
on your doorstep with all the ingredients and recipes you need to cook those meals.

295
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,280
This cuts out all the boring bits—shopping and a lot of the prep—so you skip straight

296
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,640
to cooking, and in about 30 minutes you have a delicious, fresh, home-cooked meal.

297
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,760
This is all surprisingly affordable and fairly eco-friendly—getting the exact right amount

298
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,160
of ingredients cuts food waste down by 25%, and a University of Michigan study found that

299
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,900
their streamlined supply chain means the carbon emissions of a HelloFresh meal are actually

300
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,640
lower than that of an equivalent bought through a grocery store.

301
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,800
I've used HelloFresh since 2020, before they even became a channel sponsor, and have

302
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,580
made hundreds of delicious meals through them like these bulgogi meatballs.

303
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,900
I'd really recommend giving them a try, as they could completely transform the way

304
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,820
you eat, especially since you can click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and

305
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,660
