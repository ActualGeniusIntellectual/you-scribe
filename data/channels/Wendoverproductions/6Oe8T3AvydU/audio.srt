1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Flying is expensive.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,200
Why is this?

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,520
Well, most would say it's because of the cost of fuel, but that's not entirely true.

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,760
The Airbus A320neo can carry 6,400 gallons of fuel—that's the equivalent of 376 fully

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,560
tanked Toyota Camrys.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,880
For every mile that the A320 flies, it burns 1.5 gallons of jet fuel.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,600
That works out to a paltry .67 miles per gallon.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,000
An A320 could barely fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Terminal on that

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,340
gallon of fuel.

10
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:38,520
To fly that 213 miles from New York to DC, that A320 needs 317 gallons of fuel.

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,080
With that amount, our Toyota Camry could drive from New York to LA 49 times, but we do have

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,320
to consider that a Camry only seats 5, an A320 seats 154.

13
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,560
So, assuming that our plane is fully loaded, it now has a per person fuel efficiency of

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,720
104.7 miles per gallon.

15
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,320
That's amazing.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,480
According to the Bureau of Transport Statistics, airlines pay on average only $1.24 per gallon

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,480
of fuel.

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,440
So, flying from New York to DC, you personally only use $2.50 worth of fuel, so why do these

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,440
tickets cost upwards of $80?

20
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,040
Well, there's so much more that goes into your ticket price than fuel.

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
Before we start, I'll quickly mention that these are all rough estimates.

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,000
Many of these prices will vary widely through time and there are certainly ways that airlines

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,820
reduce these costs, but this will give you a general idea of what actually makes flying

24
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,460
so expensive.

25
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,840
The first thing we can add to our ticket price is crew costs.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,280
A pilot makes on average around $79,000 a year which works out to about $44 per flight

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
hour.

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,120
We have two pilots so for our hour long flight from New York to DC, that's $88 to the pilots.

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,360
A fully loaded A320 requires four flight attendants who are each paid around $38 per

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,400
flight hour for a total of $152 bringing our crew costs up to $240.

31
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,560
So, with our 154 seats, that works out to just about $1.50 per person in crew costs.

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,680
Alright, now we're at $4.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,880
Next we gotta pay the airports.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,040
New York's John F. Kennedy Airport charges $6.33 per thousand pounds of airplane taking

35
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,480
off and our A320 weighs 172,000 pounds.

36
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,220
That means that we have to give $1,089 to JFK or $7 per person.

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,560
Dulles Airport doesn't publish their landing fees, but we'll assume it's about the

38
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,300
same as JFK's landing fees at $1,005 for a now 170,000 pound airplane.

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,160
These fees generally include the cost of using gates, porters, and other airport resources

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,760
and divide down to $13.50 per person.

41
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,280
Our total is now at $17.50.

42
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,080
Now we get to the fun part—taxes.

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,440
There's a litany of different taxes and they all vary by country so for the sake of

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,220
simplicity we'll just cover the ones for the US.

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:09,560
The simplest tax is the domestic passenger ticket tax at 7.5% of the ticket price.

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,260
That money goes to the FAA.

47
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,680
If you land or take off at a rural airport, which is defined as, an airport with less

48
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,800
than 100,000 appointments during the second preceding calendar year and either one is

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,000
not located within 75 miles of another airport with 100,000 appointments per year, 2 is receiving

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,020
central air service subsidies, or 3 is not connected by paved roads to another airport,

51
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,360
they also tack on another 7.5%.

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,000
That, of course, doesn't apply to either of our airports.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,560
The FAA also charges $4 flat for any flight within the US, unless you go to Hawaii or

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,620
Alaska.

55
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,160
Then they charge $8.70.

56
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,080
The TSA then adds a $5.60 tax called the 9-11 security fee that goes to fund the heightened

57
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,280
security since 9-11.

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,200
Those are only just for domestic flights.

59
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,460
If we were flying from New York to Paris, we would also have to add $17.70 for the international

60
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:04,260
transportation tax, $5.50 for the US customs user fee, $5 for the US animal and plant health

61
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,280
inspection service fee, $7 for the US immigration and naturalization fee, and $14 for the French

62
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,220
civil aviation tax.

63
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,920
So with all the taxes and fees that apply to this short flight, we're now at $33 total.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,400
Now, let's remember that airplanes are expensive.

65
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,840
Our A320 costs $107 million.

66
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,200
The service life for airplanes is not actually determined by flying time, it's determined

67
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,960
by something called flight cycles which is basically a fancy word for one flight.

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,200
It doesn't really matter how long an airplane flies in its service life, what matters is

69
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,760
how many times it's pressurized.

70
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,920
This is because every time it's pressurized, micro cracks develop around the rivets that

71
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,040
connect the metal plates that make up the fuselage.

72
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,940
No matter if a plane goes on a thirty minute flight or a nine hour flight, the wear and

73
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,320
tear to the plane will be the same.

74
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,720
This is why large, long haul airplanes are often older.

75
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,640
They might only go through one flight cycle per day while small regional jets could go

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
through eight or ten.

77
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,260
So, back to our A320.

78
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,880
Our plane is actually a pretty durable aircraft.

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,620
It can fly up to 60,000 cycles.

80
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,100
So if we divide the total price of our plane by the maximum number of flight cycles, we

81
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:21,680
get that $1,783 per flight must be devoted towards paying off the initial price of the

82
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,680
airplane.

83
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,460
Per person, that works out to $11.50.

84
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,260
We're now at $44.50.

85
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,660
To keep this plane safe, airlines have to also perform regular maintenance.

86
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,820
For our hour long flight, an airline has to do maintenance that'll cost $646 in labor,

87
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:48,260
$296 in parts, $603 in inspections and component overhauls, and another $596 in engine restoration.

88
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,220
That's $2,121 total or $14 per person.

89
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,900
We're now at $58.50.

90
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,540
We also have to consider the non-flying part of flying.

91
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,300
Overseeing any flight is an airline which is a business that has costs in and of itself.

92
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,900
They need to pay administrators, executives, software engineers, marketers, consultants,

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,820
customer service personnel, public relations agents, janitors, along with rent, benefits,

94
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,660
travel costs, utilities, and more.

95
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,220
It's hard to put an exact number on how much per person this works out to, but we'll

96
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,780
make a conservative estimate of $10.

97
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,500
We're up to $68.50.

98
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:33,500
An airline will pay about $106,500 per year for insurance for an A320 and assuming our

99
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,580
plane spends 8 hours per day in the air, $36 of this insurance is for this hour long

100
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,480
flight or about $0.25 per person.

101
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,780
Our very rough grand total is $68.75.

102
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,840
We'll round this up to $70 since there are various small things I didn't cover such

103
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,860
as hotel costs for crew members, plane storage, APU rental, liability insurance, etc.

104
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,700
That means that $10 of our plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that all my estimates

105
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,020
were on the conservative end and it's all assuming a fully loaded airplane.

106
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,460
In the end, not a ton of money actually goes to the airline.

107
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,380
Back to my first line, flying is expensive.

108
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,540
Well, it really isn't and it's getting cheaper.

109
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:19,420
To fly in the Magic Metal Bird across the country from New York to LA in 6 hours costs

110
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,100
around $340 round trip.

111
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,060
To drive in our very fuel efficient Toyota Camry across the country in 40 hours costs

112
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,020
$340 just in fuel than an additional $300 in estimated maintenance and depreciation

113
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,020
costs.

114
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,580
In the past 30 years, the average inflation adjusted airfare has dropped by 50% and it's

115
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,660
still dropping.

116
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,180
In 1974, it was actually illegal for airlines to offer a flight between New York and LA

117
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,540
for less than $1,442 inflation adjusted dollars.

118
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,940
And now, you can sometimes find these flights for less than $200 round trip.

119
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,580
One of the reasons for this drop in prices is the rise of efficient airplanes.

120
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,220
Certain innovations such as composite construction, better aerodynamics, more efficient engines,

121
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,020
and perhaps most notably, winglets has driven down the cost of flying.

122
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,720
Here's the one and only Real Engineering to explain winglets.

123
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,180
As you said, the airline industry is constantly finding ways to drive down their fuel consumption.

124
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,980
In the early 70's fuel prices skyrocketed and engineers were forced to find ways of

125
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,700
making their planes more efficient.

126
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,980
One way they found was with winglets, which are those little curly bits at the end of

127
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,980
the wing.

128
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,900
Let's have a quick look at how they work.

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,620
Winglets were introduced to decrease induced drag, which occurs when high pressure air

130
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,320
below the wing begins to bleed over the edge into the low pressure air above.

131
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,780
This flow creates vortices off the tips of the wing that create drag and reduce lift,

132
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,500
which reduces the fuel economy of the plane.

133
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,580
Winglets act to reduce these vortices by reducing the airflow over the edge of the wing.

134
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,660
For a full explanation and a look at the history behind winglets head over to my channel and

139
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,900
I'll leave you with the real reason specific airfares are expensive, but also a reason

140
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,740
why they're getting cheaper—competition.

141
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,260
The airline industry is one with very little competition.

142
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,020
Airfares from New York to LA are cheap because there's a lot of demand and there's a

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,820
relatively high amount of competition.

144
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,460
Five different airlines fly direct from New York to LA, two of which are budget airlines.

145
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,920
People don't care that much which airline they fly.

146
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,900
They care about the price, so airlines will try to match the price of budget airlines.

147
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,460
Compare this to a route like Denver to Gunnison County Airport.

148
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,380
Largely because only United makes this flight, you'll often pay more than $500 for this

149
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,460
130 mile flight.

150
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,580
So that's why your plane tickets cost so much.

151
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,100
Next time you book your travel, you'll know why you're paying so much and also

152
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,740
how little of that actually goes to airlines.

153
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,100
