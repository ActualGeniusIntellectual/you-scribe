00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
Flying is expensive.

00:02.200 --> 00:03.200
Why is this?

00:03.200 --> 00:07.520
Well, most would say it's because of the cost of fuel, but that's not entirely true.

00:07.520 --> 00:14.760
The Airbus A320neo can carry 6,400 gallons of fuel—that's the equivalent of 376 fully

00:14.760 --> 00:16.560
tanked Toyota Camrys.

00:16.560 --> 00:21.880
For every mile that the A320 flies, it burns 1.5 gallons of jet fuel.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.600
That works out to a paltry .67 miles per gallon.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.000
An A320 could barely fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Terminal on that

00:30.000 --> 00:31.340
gallon of fuel.

00:31.340 --> 00:38.520
To fly that 213 miles from New York to DC, that A320 needs 317 gallons of fuel.

00:38.520 --> 00:45.080
With that amount, our Toyota Camry could drive from New York to LA 49 times, but we do have

00:45.080 --> 00:51.320
to consider that a Camry only seats 5, an A320 seats 154.

00:51.320 --> 00:57.560
So, assuming that our plane is fully loaded, it now has a per person fuel efficiency of

00:57.560 --> 01:00.720
104.7 miles per gallon.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.320
That's amazing.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.480
According to the Bureau of Transport Statistics, airlines pay on average only $1.24 per gallon

01:08.480 --> 01:09.480
of fuel.

01:09.480 --> 01:16.440
So, flying from New York to DC, you personally only use $2.50 worth of fuel, so why do these

01:16.440 --> 01:18.440
tickets cost upwards of $80?

01:18.440 --> 01:23.040
Well, there's so much more that goes into your ticket price than fuel.

01:23.040 --> 01:26.720
Before we start, I'll quickly mention that these are all rough estimates.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.000
Many of these prices will vary widely through time and there are certainly ways that airlines

01:30.000 --> 01:33.820
reduce these costs, but this will give you a general idea of what actually makes flying

01:33.820 --> 01:35.460
so expensive.

01:35.460 --> 01:38.840
The first thing we can add to our ticket price is crew costs.

01:38.840 --> 01:45.280
A pilot makes on average around $79,000 a year which works out to about $44 per flight

01:45.280 --> 01:46.280
hour.

01:46.280 --> 01:52.120
We have two pilots so for our hour long flight from New York to DC, that's $88 to the pilots.

01:52.120 --> 01:57.360
A fully loaded A320 requires four flight attendants who are each paid around $38 per

01:57.360 --> 02:03.400
flight hour for a total of $152 bringing our crew costs up to $240.

02:03.400 --> 02:10.560
So, with our 154 seats, that works out to just about $1.50 per person in crew costs.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.680
Alright, now we're at $4.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.880
Next we gotta pay the airports.

02:15.880 --> 02:22.040
New York's John F. Kennedy Airport charges $6.33 per thousand pounds of airplane taking

02:22.040 --> 02:26.480
off and our A320 weighs 172,000 pounds.

02:26.480 --> 02:32.220
That means that we have to give $1,089 to JFK or $7 per person.

02:32.220 --> 02:35.560
Dulles Airport doesn't publish their landing fees, but we'll assume it's about the

02:35.560 --> 02:42.300
same as JFK's landing fees at $1,005 for a now 170,000 pound airplane.

02:42.300 --> 02:47.160
These fees generally include the cost of using gates, porters, and other airport resources

02:47.160 --> 02:50.760
and divide down to $13.50 per person.

02:50.760 --> 02:54.280
Our total is now at $17.50.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.080
Now we get to the fun part—taxes.

02:56.080 --> 03:00.440
There's a litany of different taxes and they all vary by country so for the sake of

03:00.440 --> 03:03.220
simplicity we'll just cover the ones for the US.

03:03.220 --> 03:09.560
The simplest tax is the domestic passenger ticket tax at 7.5% of the ticket price.

03:09.560 --> 03:11.260
That money goes to the FAA.

03:11.260 --> 03:15.680
If you land or take off at a rural airport, which is defined as, an airport with less

03:15.680 --> 03:18.800
than 100,000 appointments during the second preceding calendar year and either one is

03:18.800 --> 03:23.000
not located within 75 miles of another airport with 100,000 appointments per year, 2 is receiving

03:23.000 --> 03:27.020
central air service subsidies, or 3 is not connected by paved roads to another airport,

03:27.020 --> 03:29.360
they also tack on another 7.5%.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.000
That, of course, doesn't apply to either of our airports.

03:33.000 --> 03:38.560
The FAA also charges $4 flat for any flight within the US, unless you go to Hawaii or

03:38.560 --> 03:39.620
Alaska.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.160
Then they charge $8.70.

03:42.160 --> 03:48.080
The TSA then adds a $5.60 tax called the 9-11 security fee that goes to fund the heightened

03:48.080 --> 03:50.280
security since 9-11.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.200
Those are only just for domestic flights.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.460
If we were flying from New York to Paris, we would also have to add $17.70 for the international

03:57.460 --> 04:04.260
transportation tax, $5.50 for the US customs user fee, $5 for the US animal and plant health

04:04.260 --> 04:10.280
inspection service fee, $7 for the US immigration and naturalization fee, and $14 for the French

04:10.280 --> 04:12.220
civil aviation tax.

04:12.220 --> 04:17.920
So with all the taxes and fees that apply to this short flight, we're now at $33 total.

04:17.920 --> 04:21.400
Now, let's remember that airplanes are expensive.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.840
Our A320 costs $107 million.

04:24.840 --> 04:29.200
The service life for airplanes is not actually determined by flying time, it's determined

04:29.200 --> 04:33.960
by something called flight cycles which is basically a fancy word for one flight.

04:33.960 --> 04:38.200
It doesn't really matter how long an airplane flies in its service life, what matters is

04:38.200 --> 04:40.760
how many times it's pressurized.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.920
This is because every time it's pressurized, micro cracks develop around the rivets that

04:44.920 --> 04:48.040
connect the metal plates that make up the fuselage.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.940
No matter if a plane goes on a thirty minute flight or a nine hour flight, the wear and

04:51.940 --> 04:54.320
tear to the plane will be the same.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.720
This is why large, long haul airplanes are often older.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.640
They might only go through one flight cycle per day while small regional jets could go

05:01.640 --> 05:03.040
through eight or ten.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.260
So, back to our A320.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.880
Our plane is actually a pretty durable aircraft.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.620
It can fly up to 60,000 cycles.

05:10.620 --> 05:15.100
So if we divide the total price of our plane by the maximum number of flight cycles, we

05:15.100 --> 05:21.680
get that $1,783 per flight must be devoted towards paying off the initial price of the

05:21.680 --> 05:22.680
airplane.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.460
Per person, that works out to $11.50.

05:25.460 --> 05:29.260
We're now at $44.50.

05:29.260 --> 05:33.660
To keep this plane safe, airlines have to also perform regular maintenance.

05:33.660 --> 05:39.820
For our hour long flight, an airline has to do maintenance that'll cost $646 in labor,

05:39.820 --> 05:48.260
$296 in parts, $603 in inspections and component overhauls, and another $596 in engine restoration.

05:48.260 --> 05:53.220
That's $2,121 total or $14 per person.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.900
We're now at $58.50.

05:56.900 --> 06:00.540
We also have to consider the non-flying part of flying.

06:00.540 --> 06:05.300
Overseeing any flight is an airline which is a business that has costs in and of itself.

06:05.300 --> 06:09.900
They need to pay administrators, executives, software engineers, marketers, consultants,

06:09.900 --> 06:14.820
customer service personnel, public relations agents, janitors, along with rent, benefits,

06:14.820 --> 06:16.660
travel costs, utilities, and more.

06:16.660 --> 06:21.220
It's hard to put an exact number on how much per person this works out to, but we'll

06:21.220 --> 06:23.780
make a conservative estimate of $10.

06:23.780 --> 06:27.500
We're up to $68.50.

06:27.500 --> 06:33.500
An airline will pay about $106,500 per year for insurance for an A320 and assuming our

06:33.500 --> 06:38.580
plane spends 8 hours per day in the air, $36 of this insurance is for this hour long

06:38.580 --> 06:41.480
flight or about $0.25 per person.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.780
Our very rough grand total is $68.75.

06:44.780 --> 06:49.840
We'll round this up to $70 since there are various small things I didn't cover such

06:49.840 --> 06:55.860
as hotel costs for crew members, plane storage, APU rental, liability insurance, etc.

06:55.860 --> 07:00.700
That means that $10 of our plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that all my estimates

07:00.700 --> 07:05.020
were on the conservative end and it's all assuming a fully loaded airplane.

07:05.020 --> 07:08.460
In the end, not a ton of money actually goes to the airline.

07:08.460 --> 07:11.380
Back to my first line, flying is expensive.

07:11.380 --> 07:14.540
Well, it really isn't and it's getting cheaper.

07:14.540 --> 07:19.420
To fly in the Magic Metal Bird across the country from New York to LA in 6 hours costs

07:19.420 --> 07:22.100
around $340 round trip.

07:22.100 --> 07:27.060
To drive in our very fuel efficient Toyota Camry across the country in 40 hours costs

07:27.060 --> 07:33.020
$340 just in fuel than an additional $300 in estimated maintenance and depreciation

07:33.020 --> 07:34.020
costs.

07:34.020 --> 07:39.580
In the past 30 years, the average inflation adjusted airfare has dropped by 50% and it's

07:39.580 --> 07:40.660
still dropping.

07:40.660 --> 07:46.180
In 1974, it was actually illegal for airlines to offer a flight between New York and LA

07:46.180 --> 07:50.540
for less than $1,442 inflation adjusted dollars.

07:50.540 --> 07:54.940
And now, you can sometimes find these flights for less than $200 round trip.

07:54.940 --> 07:59.580
One of the reasons for this drop in prices is the rise of efficient airplanes.

07:59.580 --> 08:05.220
Certain innovations such as composite construction, better aerodynamics, more efficient engines,

08:05.220 --> 08:10.020
and perhaps most notably, winglets has driven down the cost of flying.

08:10.020 --> 08:13.720
Here's the one and only Real Engineering to explain winglets.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.180
As you said, the airline industry is constantly finding ways to drive down their fuel consumption.

08:18.180 --> 08:22.980
In the early 70's fuel prices skyrocketed and engineers were forced to find ways of

08:22.980 --> 08:24.700
making their planes more efficient.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.980
One way they found was with winglets, which are those little curly bits at the end of

08:27.980 --> 08:28.980
the wing.

08:28.980 --> 08:30.900
Let's have a quick look at how they work.

08:30.900 --> 08:34.620
Winglets were introduced to decrease induced drag, which occurs when high pressure air

08:34.620 --> 08:39.320
below the wing begins to bleed over the edge into the low pressure air above.

08:39.320 --> 08:43.780
This flow creates vortices off the tips of the wing that create drag and reduce lift,

08:43.780 --> 08:46.500
which reduces the fuel economy of the plane.

08:46.500 --> 08:50.580
Winglets act to reduce these vortices by reducing the airflow over the edge of the wing.

08:50.580 --> 08:54.660
For a full explanation and a look at the history behind winglets head over to my channel and

08:54.660 --> 08:59.760

09:08.260 --> 09:12.900
I'll leave you with the real reason specific airfares are expensive, but also a reason

09:12.900 --> 09:15.740
why they're getting cheaper—competition.

09:15.740 --> 09:19.260
The airline industry is one with very little competition.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.020
Airfares from New York to LA are cheap because there's a lot of demand and there's a

09:23.020 --> 09:25.820
relatively high amount of competition.

09:25.820 --> 09:31.460
Five different airlines fly direct from New York to LA, two of which are budget airlines.

09:31.460 --> 09:33.920
People don't care that much which airline they fly.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.900
They care about the price, so airlines will try to match the price of budget airlines.

09:38.900 --> 09:42.460
Compare this to a route like Denver to Gunnison County Airport.

09:42.460 --> 09:47.380
Largely because only United makes this flight, you'll often pay more than $500 for this

09:47.380 --> 09:49.460
130 mile flight.

09:49.460 --> 09:52.580
So that's why your plane tickets cost so much.

09:52.580 --> 09:56.100
Next time you book your travel, you'll know why you're paying so much and also

09:56.100 --> 09:59.740
how little of that actually goes to airlines.
