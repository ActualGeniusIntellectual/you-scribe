0	2200	Flying is expensive.
2200	3200	Why is this?
3200	7520	Well, most would say it's because of the cost of fuel, but that's not entirely true.
7520	14760	The Airbus A320neo can carry 6,400 gallons of fuel—that's the equivalent of 376 fully
14760	16560	tanked Toyota Camrys.
16560	21880	For every mile that the A320 flies, it burns 1.5 gallons of jet fuel.
21880	25600	That works out to a paltry .67 miles per gallon.
25600	30000	An A320 could barely fly from the Empire State Building to Grand Central Terminal on that
30000	31340	gallon of fuel.
31340	38520	To fly that 213 miles from New York to DC, that A320 needs 317 gallons of fuel.
38520	45080	With that amount, our Toyota Camry could drive from New York to LA 49 times, but we do have
45080	51320	to consider that a Camry only seats 5, an A320 seats 154.
51320	57560	So, assuming that our plane is fully loaded, it now has a per person fuel efficiency of
57560	60720	104.7 miles per gallon.
60720	62320	That's amazing.
62320	68480	According to the Bureau of Transport Statistics, airlines pay on average only $1.24 per gallon
68480	69480	of fuel.
69480	76440	So, flying from New York to DC, you personally only use $2.50 worth of fuel, so why do these
76440	78440	tickets cost upwards of $80?
78440	83040	Well, there's so much more that goes into your ticket price than fuel.
83040	86720	Before we start, I'll quickly mention that these are all rough estimates.
86720	90000	Many of these prices will vary widely through time and there are certainly ways that airlines
90000	93820	reduce these costs, but this will give you a general idea of what actually makes flying
93820	95460	so expensive.
95460	98840	The first thing we can add to our ticket price is crew costs.
98840	105280	A pilot makes on average around $79,000 a year which works out to about $44 per flight
105280	106280	hour.
106280	112120	We have two pilots so for our hour long flight from New York to DC, that's $88 to the pilots.
112120	117360	A fully loaded A320 requires four flight attendants who are each paid around $38 per
117360	123400	flight hour for a total of $152 bringing our crew costs up to $240.
123400	130560	So, with our 154 seats, that works out to just about $1.50 per person in crew costs.
130560	133680	Alright, now we're at $4.
133680	135880	Next we gotta pay the airports.
135880	142040	New York's John F. Kennedy Airport charges $6.33 per thousand pounds of airplane taking
142040	146480	off and our A320 weighs 172,000 pounds.
146480	152220	That means that we have to give $1,089 to JFK or $7 per person.
152220	155560	Dulles Airport doesn't publish their landing fees, but we'll assume it's about the
155560	162300	same as JFK's landing fees at $1,005 for a now 170,000 pound airplane.
162300	167160	These fees generally include the cost of using gates, porters, and other airport resources
167160	170760	and divide down to $13.50 per person.
170760	174280	Our total is now at $17.50.
174280	176080	Now we get to the fun part—taxes.
176080	180440	There's a litany of different taxes and they all vary by country so for the sake of
180440	183220	simplicity we'll just cover the ones for the US.
183220	189560	The simplest tax is the domestic passenger ticket tax at 7.5% of the ticket price.
189560	191260	That money goes to the FAA.
191260	195680	If you land or take off at a rural airport, which is defined as, an airport with less
195680	198800	than 100,000 appointments during the second preceding calendar year and either one is
198800	203000	not located within 75 miles of another airport with 100,000 appointments per year, 2 is receiving
203000	207020	central air service subsidies, or 3 is not connected by paved roads to another airport,
207020	209360	they also tack on another 7.5%.
209360	213000	That, of course, doesn't apply to either of our airports.
213000	218560	The FAA also charges $4 flat for any flight within the US, unless you go to Hawaii or
218560	219620	Alaska.
219620	222160	Then they charge $8.70.
222160	228080	The TSA then adds a $5.60 tax called the 9-11 security fee that goes to fund the heightened
228080	230280	security since 9-11.
230280	232200	Those are only just for domestic flights.
232200	237460	If we were flying from New York to Paris, we would also have to add $17.70 for the international
237460	244260	transportation tax, $5.50 for the US customs user fee, $5 for the US animal and plant health
244260	250280	inspection service fee, $7 for the US immigration and naturalization fee, and $14 for the French
250280	252220	civil aviation tax.
252220	257920	So with all the taxes and fees that apply to this short flight, we're now at $33 total.
257920	261400	Now, let's remember that airplanes are expensive.
261400	264840	Our A320 costs $107 million.
264840	269200	The service life for airplanes is not actually determined by flying time, it's determined
269200	273960	by something called flight cycles which is basically a fancy word for one flight.
273960	278200	It doesn't really matter how long an airplane flies in its service life, what matters is
278200	280760	how many times it's pressurized.
280760	284920	This is because every time it's pressurized, micro cracks develop around the rivets that
284920	288040	connect the metal plates that make up the fuselage.
288040	291940	No matter if a plane goes on a thirty minute flight or a nine hour flight, the wear and
291940	294320	tear to the plane will be the same.
294320	297720	This is why large, long haul airplanes are often older.
297720	301640	They might only go through one flight cycle per day while small regional jets could go
301640	303040	through eight or ten.
303040	305260	So, back to our A320.
305260	307880	Our plane is actually a pretty durable aircraft.
307880	310620	It can fly up to 60,000 cycles.
310620	315100	So if we divide the total price of our plane by the maximum number of flight cycles, we
315100	321680	get that $1,783 per flight must be devoted towards paying off the initial price of the
321680	322680	airplane.
322680	325460	Per person, that works out to $11.50.
325460	329260	We're now at $44.50.
329260	333660	To keep this plane safe, airlines have to also perform regular maintenance.
333660	339820	For our hour long flight, an airline has to do maintenance that'll cost $646 in labor,
339820	348260	$296 in parts, $603 in inspections and component overhauls, and another $596 in engine restoration.
348260	353220	That's $2,121 total or $14 per person.
353220	356900	We're now at $58.50.
356900	360540	We also have to consider the non-flying part of flying.
360540	365300	Overseeing any flight is an airline which is a business that has costs in and of itself.
365300	369900	They need to pay administrators, executives, software engineers, marketers, consultants,
369900	374820	customer service personnel, public relations agents, janitors, along with rent, benefits,
374820	376660	travel costs, utilities, and more.
376660	381220	It's hard to put an exact number on how much per person this works out to, but we'll
381220	383780	make a conservative estimate of $10.
383780	387500	We're up to $68.50.
387500	393500	An airline will pay about $106,500 per year for insurance for an A320 and assuming our
393500	398580	plane spends 8 hours per day in the air, $36 of this insurance is for this hour long
398580	401480	flight or about $0.25 per person.
401480	404780	Our very rough grand total is $68.75.
404780	409840	We'll round this up to $70 since there are various small things I didn't cover such
409840	415860	as hotel costs for crew members, plane storage, APU rental, liability insurance, etc.
415860	420700	That means that $10 of our plane ticket is profit, but keep in mind that all my estimates
420700	425020	were on the conservative end and it's all assuming a fully loaded airplane.
425020	428460	In the end, not a ton of money actually goes to the airline.
428460	431380	Back to my first line, flying is expensive.
431380	434540	Well, it really isn't and it's getting cheaper.
434540	439420	To fly in the Magic Metal Bird across the country from New York to LA in 6 hours costs
439420	442100	around $340 round trip.
442100	447060	To drive in our very fuel efficient Toyota Camry across the country in 40 hours costs
447060	453020	$340 just in fuel than an additional $300 in estimated maintenance and depreciation
453020	454020	costs.
454020	459580	In the past 30 years, the average inflation adjusted airfare has dropped by 50% and it's
459580	460660	still dropping.
460660	466180	In 1974, it was actually illegal for airlines to offer a flight between New York and LA
466180	470540	for less than $1,442 inflation adjusted dollars.
470540	474940	And now, you can sometimes find these flights for less than $200 round trip.
474940	479580	One of the reasons for this drop in prices is the rise of efficient airplanes.
479580	485220	Certain innovations such as composite construction, better aerodynamics, more efficient engines,
485220	490020	and perhaps most notably, winglets has driven down the cost of flying.
490020	493720	Here's the one and only Real Engineering to explain winglets.
493720	498180	As you said, the airline industry is constantly finding ways to drive down their fuel consumption.
498180	502980	In the early 70's fuel prices skyrocketed and engineers were forced to find ways of
502980	504700	making their planes more efficient.
504700	507980	One way they found was with winglets, which are those little curly bits at the end of
507980	508980	the wing.
508980	510900	Let's have a quick look at how they work.
510900	514620	Winglets were introduced to decrease induced drag, which occurs when high pressure air
514620	519320	below the wing begins to bleed over the edge into the low pressure air above.
519320	523780	This flow creates vortices off the tips of the wing that create drag and reduce lift,
523780	526500	which reduces the fuel economy of the plane.
526500	530580	Winglets act to reduce these vortices by reducing the airflow over the edge of the wing.
530580	534660	For a full explanation and a look at the history behind winglets head over to my channel and
534660	539760	watch my new video, which features a special guest appearance from Wendover Productions.

548260	552900	I'll leave you with the real reason specific airfares are expensive, but also a reason
552900	555740	why they're getting cheaper—competition.
555740	559260	The airline industry is one with very little competition.
559260	563020	Airfares from New York to LA are cheap because there's a lot of demand and there's a
563020	565820	relatively high amount of competition.
565820	571460	Five different airlines fly direct from New York to LA, two of which are budget airlines.
571460	573920	People don't care that much which airline they fly.
573920	578900	They care about the price, so airlines will try to match the price of budget airlines.
578900	582460	Compare this to a route like Denver to Gunnison County Airport.
582460	587380	Largely because only United makes this flight, you'll often pay more than $500 for this
587380	589460	130 mile flight.
589460	592580	So that's why your plane tickets cost so much.
592580	596100	Next time you book your travel, you'll know why you're paying so much and also
596100	599740	how little of that actually goes to airlines.
