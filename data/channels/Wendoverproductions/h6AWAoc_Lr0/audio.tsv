0	7440	Today, we're going to talk about space law.
7440	11840	So back in ye old days, property owners had the rights to their land going up forever
11840	14160	and ever in perpetuity.
14160	17720	But then the airplane came around and smart people realized that you couldn't just go
17720	22320	around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace.
22320	26560	So governments decided that they would own the air above a certain level.
26560	31560	In general, governments decided that property owners owned their land up to 500 feet above
31560	36800	ground level and then the air above that, going up infinitely, was to be owned and controlled
36800	38460	by the government.
38460	42500	This made life easier for airplanes, but then America invented space and that made things
42500	44480	a little more complicated.
44480	48820	In most cases, satellites and spacecraft orbit around the earth so it would be a logistical
48820	54240	nightmare to request permission to enter into the airspace of each nation in an orbit.
54280	57920	Once again, smart people got together and decided that those air rights that countries
57920	61640	had given themselves should end at a certain level.
61640	65040	Different countries say different things, but all of them agree that somewhere between
65040	69880	19 miles above earth, the altitude of the highest airplanes and balloons, and 99 miles
69880	74720	above earth, the altitude of the lowest orbiting satellites, a country's claim to sovereignty
74720	76080	stops.
76080	80480	So this begs the question, which laws apply in space?
80480	84760	So let's say an astronaut commits a small crime while in space, like, I don't know,
84760	87640	doing a line while on a spacecraft.
87640	91760	This isn't a huge crime against humanity, but they're going to have to be punished.
91760	95640	If the astronaut had those happy times while on the spacecraft of a specific country, it
95640	98480	would be clear which country it would prosecute.
98480	101440	If it was in a Soyuz capsule, Russia would prosecute.
101440	105320	If it was in a SpaceX capsule, the US would prosecute.
105320	109960	Much like with boats, the spacecraft is considered to be an extension of the sovereignty of that
110440	111440	country.
111440	115700	But, let's say Mr. Astronaut did his line while on the moon, who would prosecute then?
115700	120960	The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 says that no country can claim a section of space or a
120960	126180	celestial body as their territory, so this means that no country's laws apply universally
126180	127180	on the moon.
127180	132720	Well, this is where the idea of extraterritorial jurisdiction comes into play.
132720	137720	In almost every country, citizens are subject to the laws of their own country even if they
137760	140240	are outside of the country.
140240	144240	This doesn't apply when they are in other countries since the other country's laws
144240	149080	trump the extraterritorial jurisdiction, but when they aren't in any country, these laws
149080	150600	do apply.
150600	155920	This means that two people in the exact same place can be subject to different laws.
155920	160560	An 18 year old British astronaut could technically drink on the moon while an 18 year old American
160560	162920	astronaut could not.
162920	167040	Just to make things a little bit more complicated, the rules are different on the International
167040	168720	Space Station.
168720	173660	This space station agreement, the document that outlines the rules of the ISS, says that
173660	177920	in most cases extraterritorial jurisdiction applies.
177920	181240	Each astronaut is subject to the laws of their own country.
181240	187180	However, if for example an American astronaut say, punches a French one out of frustration,
187180	190800	France would be allowed to prosecute the American astronaut.
190800	192840	The same rule applies with property.
192840	197160	If a British astronaut smashes a Canadian astronaut's computer, Canada could prosecute
197160	198800	the Brit.
198800	203980	In addition, this agreement allows for the extradition of astronauts in all cases regardless
203980	207320	if the two countries have a normal extradition treaty.
207320	211200	This is actually pretty important because Russia doesn't have an extradition treaty
211200	212600	with the US.
212600	216320	This means that Russia doesn't have to give up individuals who have committed a crime
216320	219280	in which the US has the right to prosecute.
219280	223840	In the case that a Russian commits a crime against an American on the ISS, however, Russia
223840	227600	would be obliged to extradite that astronaut.
227600	232620	Another situation to look at is what would happen if a baby was born in space.
232620	236680	First off, this is a super hypothetical because it's unknown if it's even possible for
236680	241800	a baby to be born in zero gravity and, if they were, their bones would be so brittle
241800	245440	that they would crush under their own weight if they returned to gravity.
245440	249960	It's unlikely that any country would allow for an astronaut to have a baby in space because
249960	252840	that would be like super unethical.
252840	256480	But for the sake of argument, let's say there was a space baby.
256480	258700	What nationality would that baby be?
258700	261440	There is actually precedent for this question.
261440	267800	13 babies have been born in Antarctica where there is a similar treaty that disallows sovereignty.
267800	271960	While those babies were not born in their parents' countries, they took their parents'
271960	272960	nationalities.
273000	275880	The same policy applies in space.
275880	279640	There are countries, however, that don't give citizenship to babies born outside of
279640	280840	the country.
280840	285240	So in that case, the baby would take the citizenship of the country of the spacecraft they were
285240	286600	born in.
286600	290920	This is the same rule that applies when a baby is born on an airplane in flight.
290920	294800	They take the nationality of their parents and, if that's not possible, they take the
294800	298560	nationality of the country in which the aircraft is registered.
298560	302320	And what happens if the baby is born on the moon or Mars where there is no sovereignty?
302320	306400	Well, I don't know man, what do I look like, a lawyer?
306400	309360	But seriously, nobody really knows.
309360	313520	This is just one of many flaws in current space law.
313520	318640	Only 536 people have been to space and all of them were highly trained and were representing
318640	320000	their country.
320000	323840	They just aren't the type of people to commit crimes.
323840	328540	As commercial spaceflight and space tourism develop, all these laws will need to be made
328540	331740	more clear to prevent future problems.
331740	337020	Gone is the era when these laws can just be figured out when and if the time comes.
337020	341620	In the near future, we could be seeing space mining as well, and that will require economic
341620	344820	laws and environmental treaties.
344820	349460	The coming decades will be a fascinating time as we watch not only the development of commercial
349460	354340	space industries, but also as we lay out the legal and political groundwork needed for
354340	373940	the opening of the final frontier.
