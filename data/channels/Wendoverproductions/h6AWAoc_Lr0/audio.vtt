00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Today, we're going to talk about space law.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.840
So back in ye old days, property owners had the rights to their land going up forever

00:11.840 --> 00:14.160
and ever in perpetuity.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.720
But then the airplane came around and smart people realized that you couldn't just go

00:17.720 --> 00:22.320
around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace.

00:22.320 --> 00:26.560
So governments decided that they would own the air above a certain level.

00:26.560 --> 00:31.560
In general, governments decided that property owners owned their land up to 500 feet above

00:31.560 --> 00:36.800
ground level and then the air above that, going up infinitely, was to be owned and controlled

00:36.800 --> 00:38.460
by the government.

00:38.460 --> 00:42.500
This made life easier for airplanes, but then America invented space and that made things

00:42.500 --> 00:44.480
a little more complicated.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.820
In most cases, satellites and spacecraft orbit around the earth so it would be a logistical

00:48.820 --> 00:54.240
nightmare to request permission to enter into the airspace of each nation in an orbit.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.920
Once again, smart people got together and decided that those air rights that countries

00:57.920 --> 01:01.640
had given themselves should end at a certain level.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.040
Different countries say different things, but all of them agree that somewhere between

01:05.040 --> 01:09.880
19 miles above earth, the altitude of the highest airplanes and balloons, and 99 miles

01:09.880 --> 01:14.720
above earth, the altitude of the lowest orbiting satellites, a country's claim to sovereignty

01:14.720 --> 01:16.080
stops.

01:16.080 --> 01:20.480
So this begs the question, which laws apply in space?

01:20.480 --> 01:24.760
So let's say an astronaut commits a small crime while in space, like, I don't know,

01:24.760 --> 01:27.640
doing a line while on a spacecraft.

01:27.640 --> 01:31.760
This isn't a huge crime against humanity, but they're going to have to be punished.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.640
If the astronaut had those happy times while on the spacecraft of a specific country, it

01:35.640 --> 01:38.480
would be clear which country it would prosecute.

01:38.480 --> 01:41.440
If it was in a Soyuz capsule, Russia would prosecute.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.320
If it was in a SpaceX capsule, the US would prosecute.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.960
Much like with boats, the spacecraft is considered to be an extension of the sovereignty of that

01:50.440 --> 01:51.440
country.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.700
But, let's say Mr. Astronaut did his line while on the moon, who would prosecute then?

01:55.700 --> 02:00.960
The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 says that no country can claim a section of space or a

02:00.960 --> 02:06.180
celestial body as their territory, so this means that no country's laws apply universally

02:06.180 --> 02:07.180
on the moon.

02:07.180 --> 02:12.720
Well, this is where the idea of extraterritorial jurisdiction comes into play.

02:12.720 --> 02:17.720
In almost every country, citizens are subject to the laws of their own country even if they

02:17.760 --> 02:20.240
are outside of the country.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.240
This doesn't apply when they are in other countries since the other country's laws

02:24.240 --> 02:29.080
trump the extraterritorial jurisdiction, but when they aren't in any country, these laws

02:29.080 --> 02:30.600
do apply.

02:30.600 --> 02:35.920
This means that two people in the exact same place can be subject to different laws.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.560
An 18 year old British astronaut could technically drink on the moon while an 18 year old American

02:40.560 --> 02:42.920
astronaut could not.

02:42.920 --> 02:47.040
Just to make things a little bit more complicated, the rules are different on the International

02:47.040 --> 02:48.720
Space Station.

02:48.720 --> 02:53.660
This space station agreement, the document that outlines the rules of the ISS, says that

02:53.660 --> 02:57.920
in most cases extraterritorial jurisdiction applies.

02:57.920 --> 03:01.240
Each astronaut is subject to the laws of their own country.

03:01.240 --> 03:07.180
However, if for example an American astronaut say, punches a French one out of frustration,

03:07.180 --> 03:10.800
France would be allowed to prosecute the American astronaut.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.840
The same rule applies with property.

03:12.840 --> 03:17.160
If a British astronaut smashes a Canadian astronaut's computer, Canada could prosecute

03:17.160 --> 03:18.800
the Brit.

03:18.800 --> 03:23.980
In addition, this agreement allows for the extradition of astronauts in all cases regardless

03:23.980 --> 03:27.320
if the two countries have a normal extradition treaty.

03:27.320 --> 03:31.200
This is actually pretty important because Russia doesn't have an extradition treaty

03:31.200 --> 03:32.600
with the US.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.320
This means that Russia doesn't have to give up individuals who have committed a crime

03:36.320 --> 03:39.280
in which the US has the right to prosecute.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.840
In the case that a Russian commits a crime against an American on the ISS, however, Russia

03:43.840 --> 03:47.600
would be obliged to extradite that astronaut.

03:47.600 --> 03:52.620
Another situation to look at is what would happen if a baby was born in space.

03:52.620 --> 03:56.680
First off, this is a super hypothetical because it's unknown if it's even possible for

03:56.680 --> 04:01.800
a baby to be born in zero gravity and, if they were, their bones would be so brittle

04:01.800 --> 04:05.440
that they would crush under their own weight if they returned to gravity.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.960
It's unlikely that any country would allow for an astronaut to have a baby in space because

04:09.960 --> 04:12.840
that would be like super unethical.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.480
But for the sake of argument, let's say there was a space baby.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.700
What nationality would that baby be?

04:18.700 --> 04:21.440
There is actually precedent for this question.

04:21.440 --> 04:27.800
13 babies have been born in Antarctica where there is a similar treaty that disallows sovereignty.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.960
While those babies were not born in their parents' countries, they took their parents'

04:31.960 --> 04:32.960
nationalities.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.880
The same policy applies in space.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.640
There are countries, however, that don't give citizenship to babies born outside of

04:39.640 --> 04:40.840
the country.

04:40.840 --> 04:45.240
So in that case, the baby would take the citizenship of the country of the spacecraft they were

04:45.240 --> 04:46.600
born in.

04:46.600 --> 04:50.920
This is the same rule that applies when a baby is born on an airplane in flight.

04:50.920 --> 04:54.800
They take the nationality of their parents and, if that's not possible, they take the

04:54.800 --> 04:58.560
nationality of the country in which the aircraft is registered.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.320
And what happens if the baby is born on the moon or Mars where there is no sovereignty?

05:02.320 --> 05:06.400
Well, I don't know man, what do I look like, a lawyer?

05:06.400 --> 05:09.360
But seriously, nobody really knows.

05:09.360 --> 05:13.520
This is just one of many flaws in current space law.

05:13.520 --> 05:18.640
Only 536 people have been to space and all of them were highly trained and were representing

05:18.640 --> 05:20.000
their country.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.840
They just aren't the type of people to commit crimes.

05:23.840 --> 05:28.540
As commercial spaceflight and space tourism develop, all these laws will need to be made

05:28.540 --> 05:31.740
more clear to prevent future problems.

05:31.740 --> 05:37.020
Gone is the era when these laws can just be figured out when and if the time comes.

05:37.020 --> 05:41.620
In the near future, we could be seeing space mining as well, and that will require economic

05:41.620 --> 05:44.820
laws and environmental treaties.

05:44.820 --> 05:49.460
The coming decades will be a fascinating time as we watch not only the development of commercial

05:49.460 --> 05:54.340
space industries, but also as we lay out the legal and political groundwork needed for

05:54.340 --> 06:13.940
the opening of the final frontier.
