1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Today, we're going to talk about space law.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,840
So back in ye old days, property owners had the rights to their land going up forever

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,160
and ever in perpetuity.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,720
But then the airplane came around and smart people realized that you couldn't just go

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,320
around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,560
So governments decided that they would own the air above a certain level.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,560
In general, governments decided that property owners owned their land up to 500 feet above

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,800
ground level and then the air above that, going up infinitely, was to be owned and controlled

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,460
by the government.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,500
This made life easier for airplanes, but then America invented space and that made things

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,480
a little more complicated.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,820
In most cases, satellites and spacecraft orbit around the earth so it would be a logistical

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,240
nightmare to request permission to enter into the airspace of each nation in an orbit.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,920
Once again, smart people got together and decided that those air rights that countries

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,640
had given themselves should end at a certain level.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,040
Different countries say different things, but all of them agree that somewhere between

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,880
19 miles above earth, the altitude of the highest airplanes and balloons, and 99 miles

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,720
above earth, the altitude of the lowest orbiting satellites, a country's claim to sovereignty

19
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,080
stops.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,480
So this begs the question, which laws apply in space?

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,760
So let's say an astronaut commits a small crime while in space, like, I don't know,

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,640
doing a line while on a spacecraft.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,760
This isn't a huge crime against humanity, but they're going to have to be punished.

24
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,640
If the astronaut had those happy times while on the spacecraft of a specific country, it

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,480
would be clear which country it would prosecute.

26
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,440
If it was in a Soyuz capsule, Russia would prosecute.

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,320
If it was in a SpaceX capsule, the US would prosecute.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,960
Much like with boats, the spacecraft is considered to be an extension of the sovereignty of that

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
country.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,700
But, let's say Mr. Astronaut did his line while on the moon, who would prosecute then?

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,960
The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 says that no country can claim a section of space or a

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,180
celestial body as their territory, so this means that no country's laws apply universally

33
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
on the moon.

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:12,720
Well, this is where the idea of extraterritorial jurisdiction comes into play.

35
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
In almost every country, citizens are subject to the laws of their own country even if they

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,240
are outside of the country.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,240
This doesn't apply when they are in other countries since the other country's laws

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,080
trump the extraterritorial jurisdiction, but when they aren't in any country, these laws

39
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,600
do apply.

40
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,920
This means that two people in the exact same place can be subject to different laws.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,560
An 18 year old British astronaut could technically drink on the moon while an 18 year old American

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,920
astronaut could not.

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,040
Just to make things a little bit more complicated, the rules are different on the International

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,720
Space Station.

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,660
This space station agreement, the document that outlines the rules of the ISS, says that

46
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,920
in most cases extraterritorial jurisdiction applies.

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,240
Each astronaut is subject to the laws of their own country.

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,180
However, if for example an American astronaut say, punches a French one out of frustration,

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,800
France would be allowed to prosecute the American astronaut.

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
The same rule applies with property.

51
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,160
If a British astronaut smashes a Canadian astronaut's computer, Canada could prosecute

52
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,800
the Brit.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,980
In addition, this agreement allows for the extradition of astronauts in all cases regardless

54
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,320
if the two countries have a normal extradition treaty.

55
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,200
This is actually pretty important because Russia doesn't have an extradition treaty

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,600
with the US.

57
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,320
This means that Russia doesn't have to give up individuals who have committed a crime

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,280
in which the US has the right to prosecute.

59
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,840
In the case that a Russian commits a crime against an American on the ISS, however, Russia

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,600
would be obliged to extradite that astronaut.

61
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,620
Another situation to look at is what would happen if a baby was born in space.

62
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,680
First off, this is a super hypothetical because it's unknown if it's even possible for

63
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,800
a baby to be born in zero gravity and, if they were, their bones would be so brittle

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,440
that they would crush under their own weight if they returned to gravity.

65
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,960
It's unlikely that any country would allow for an astronaut to have a baby in space because

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,840
that would be like super unethical.

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,480
But for the sake of argument, let's say there was a space baby.

68
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,700
What nationality would that baby be?

69
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,440
There is actually precedent for this question.

70
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,800
13 babies have been born in Antarctica where there is a similar treaty that disallows sovereignty.

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,960
While those babies were not born in their parents' countries, they took their parents'

72
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
nationalities.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,880
The same policy applies in space.

74
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,640
There are countries, however, that don't give citizenship to babies born outside of

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,840
the country.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,240
So in that case, the baby would take the citizenship of the country of the spacecraft they were

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,600
born in.

78
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,920
This is the same rule that applies when a baby is born on an airplane in flight.

79
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,800
They take the nationality of their parents and, if that's not possible, they take the

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
nationality of the country in which the aircraft is registered.

81
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
And what happens if the baby is born on the moon or Mars where there is no sovereignty?

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,400
Well, I don't know man, what do I look like, a lawyer?

83
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,360
But seriously, nobody really knows.

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,520
This is just one of many flaws in current space law.

85
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,640
Only 536 people have been to space and all of them were highly trained and were representing

86
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,000
their country.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,840
They just aren't the type of people to commit crimes.

88
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,540
As commercial spaceflight and space tourism develop, all these laws will need to be made

89
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,740
more clear to prevent future problems.

90
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,020
Gone is the era when these laws can just be figured out when and if the time comes.

91
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,620
In the near future, we could be seeing space mining as well, and that will require economic

92
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,820
laws and environmental treaties.

93
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,460
The coming decades will be a fascinating time as we watch not only the development of commercial

94
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:54,340
space industries, but also as we lay out the legal and political groundwork needed for

95
00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:13,940
the opening of the final frontier.
