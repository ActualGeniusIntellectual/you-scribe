00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Imagine an America where you could just go anywhere by train—one where one could pick

00:04.880 --> 00:09.600
from four daily options from Pittsburgh, each arriving in Columbus some six hours on.

00:09.600 --> 00:13.760
One where twice-daily trains left Denver, tracked south, then climbed through the most

00:13.760 --> 00:18.240
rugged reaches of the Rockies, providing passengers a selection of dozens of destinations

00:18.240 --> 00:22.640
that today can only be reached by the most reliable off-roaders. One where the same

00:22.640 --> 00:27.280
sleeper that left Washington on a Monday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday would pull

00:27.280 --> 00:32.480
into San Francisco on a Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. One where even Hawaii

00:32.480 --> 00:37.360
had trains, linking the south of Oahu to its north, stopping at countless coastal communities

00:37.360 --> 00:42.560
along the way. One where one could go from Indianapolis to Nashville, or Albany to Burlington,

00:42.560 --> 00:48.560
or Dallas to Denver, or Boise to Spokane, or anywhere to anywhere—an interconnected,

00:48.560 --> 00:53.760
frequent, reliable, affordable nationwide network where all it took to travel anywhere was a quick

00:53.760 --> 01:01.760
walk to your town's local station. This America existed. In fact, if you average America out,

01:01.760 --> 01:07.200
if you examine the country through its most persistent configuration, this is America.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.760
The development of the nation was so deeply intertwined with the development of the railroads

01:11.760 --> 01:17.120
that if anything, today, the blip in time since World War II where automobiles have come to define

01:17.120 --> 01:23.280
the landscape, that's the aberration—trains are the norm. This average configuration of

01:23.280 --> 01:28.720
America can return, but before, it has to recognize the minor yet monumentally

01:28.720 --> 01:34.560
meaningful mistake that took it off track and into today's exceptional, irrational reality.

01:34.560 --> 01:40.320
The rise of American rail was as meteoric as it was chaotic. Bolstered by favorable loans,

01:40.320 --> 01:44.320
cheap labor, and with full-fledged federal government support in the form of land grants,

01:44.320 --> 01:50.240
the back half of the 19th century saw American rail mileage nearly double for three consecutive

01:50.240 --> 01:55.760
decades. The result was a nation quickly over-indexed with a maze of mismatching rails.

01:55.760 --> 01:59.760
The race for critical market share was rash, bordering on irrational, as companies ran

01:59.760 --> 02:05.040
redundant rails into cities, dropped rates to bleed others dry, and, in the most extreme cases,

02:05.040 --> 02:10.240
even took up arms. But the frenzy launched an industry which in turn built a nation.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.360
The craze couldn't last. While railroads became the nation's second-largest employer behind

02:15.360 --> 02:19.520
only agriculture, and nationwide rail mileage would continue upward into the next century,

02:19.520 --> 02:23.760
the industry began to mature—expansion for the sake of expansion gave way to

02:23.760 --> 02:30.160
efficiency-focused consolidation. This shift in approach was best epitomized by J.P. Morgan.

02:30.160 --> 02:36.320
In 1869, Morgan entered the industry with the purchase of this—the tiny Albany-Susquehanna

02:36.320 --> 02:42.240
line—but rather than expand lines, he looked to cut unnecessary costs and inefficient practices.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.840
In the following decades, the Gilded Age financier reorganized companies,

02:45.920 --> 02:50.640
ended rate wars, and removed duplicate routings, hoovering up railroad shares as he went.

02:50.640 --> 02:56.080
By 1902, the maneuvering had wrestled Morgan control over an estimated six of all American

02:56.080 --> 03:02.560
railways, streamlining services to maximize gains. While atypically successful, Morgan's focus on

03:02.560 --> 03:08.080
efficiency was hardly unique. As his empire grew, companies like Great Northern experimented with

03:08.080 --> 03:13.040
route optimization. By employing heavy trains, focusing on maximizing car loads, and only

03:13.040 --> 03:17.440
running at full capacity, the railroad pulled higher revenue at lower costs—an approach that

03:17.440 --> 03:22.800
made railroads increasingly popular to private investors across the US. Through the expansion

03:22.800 --> 03:27.920
era, the rails had become central to American life. Like post offices and town halls, rail

03:27.920 --> 03:32.800
stations were staples of every downtown, and day to day, the average traveler and business owner

03:32.800 --> 03:38.480
alike steadfastly relied on trains' consistent, constant availability. Through the consolidation

03:38.480 --> 03:43.040
phase, however, as track gauges standardized, companies merged, and financiers looked to

03:43.040 --> 03:47.760
maximize profits, rails also became critical wealth-generating machines for the American

03:47.760 --> 03:53.520
capitalist. Effectively then, by centuries close, the rails served two masters with divergent

03:53.520 --> 03:57.920
purposes—the American public who required their passenger and freight capabilities,

03:57.920 --> 04:02.800
and their investors who poured money in with the expectation that efficiency gains and optimization

04:02.800 --> 04:08.400
would create more money. From the jump, finding the balance between these two purposes was tricky,

04:08.720 --> 04:12.960
with the arrival of the combustion engine, it became nearly impossible.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.840
The reasons behind American rails decline are well established. Affordable automobiles, improving

04:19.840 --> 04:24.880
roads and highways, and increasing consumerism sent passenger rails plummeting. And it wasn't

04:24.880 --> 04:29.840
just cars making things worse for the rails, but trucks. Freight now faced its first real

04:29.840 --> 04:34.160
competition after World War II as American trucking companies operated on interstates,

04:34.160 --> 04:38.800
moving increasingly diverse goods from increasingly dispersed factories to various

04:38.800 --> 04:44.480
alternating locations. Rails simply struggled to match the flexibility and convenience offered by

04:44.480 --> 04:50.000
the roads. In a car-centric society, passenger service was becoming less viable by the year,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.440
and while rail was still the king of heavy freight, it would need to make adjustments

04:53.440 --> 04:58.480
in the face of its first real competitor. Yet, while the writing was on the wall,

04:58.480 --> 05:02.640
iconic passenger lines—the Rio Grande Zephyr, the Santa Fe Super Chief,

05:02.640 --> 05:08.320
the Great Northern Empire Builder—continued to run through the 60s. It was entirely counterintuitive.

05:08.320 --> 05:13.520
In a 1967 government report, officials concluded that for every dollar of revenue a carrier would

05:13.520 --> 05:20.880
lose if discontinuing a passenger service, it would save from $1.45 to $2.42 in costs.

05:20.880 --> 05:25.440
But the rails didn't run these routings because they turned a profit—they ran them because they

05:25.440 --> 05:30.080
had to. The Interstate Commerce Commission, established to ensure that the rails continued

05:30.080 --> 05:34.000
to provide service for the American consumer, in this case by maintaining important travel

05:34.000 --> 05:38.480
corridors, made it practically impossible for railroads to abandon passenger routes

05:38.480 --> 05:43.520
no matter how deeply unprofitable. Since the creation of the ICC in the 1880s,

05:43.520 --> 05:49.360
the rails were closely monitored and heavily regulated. Now, yesterday's safeguards were

05:49.360 --> 05:54.320
choking them out. Railroads cut infrastructure investment, windowed down their lines, entered

05:54.320 --> 05:59.840
risky mergers, and filed for bankruptcy. By the late 60s, the industry was on the verge

05:59.840 --> 06:05.280
of collapse. With a vitally important cog to the American economy on the brink, the federal

06:05.280 --> 06:11.600
government decided to step in. The idea was simple—give the rail companies a chance by getting

06:11.600 --> 06:16.160
out of their way. Through federal grants and loans, the Department of Transportation figured

06:16.160 --> 06:20.800
the government could prop up a public corporation to provide passenger rail rather than counting

06:20.800 --> 06:25.680
on the freight lines to do so. And by maximizing profitable routings in the Northeast Corridor and

06:25.680 --> 06:30.080
elsewhere, they figured, the front-end investment would lead to the service breaking even within

06:30.080 --> 06:34.960
four years. For their side of the bargain, the railroads would hand over their passenger stock,

06:34.960 --> 06:40.800
and would allow the new service to use their rails for a fair rate. In 1970, Nixon signed the Rail

06:40.800 --> 06:46.800
Passenger Service Act, and Amtrak went from concept to reality. Looking back, from an

06:46.800 --> 06:52.400
industry perspective, the Amtrak deal and deregulation worked. Rails shed their passenger

06:52.400 --> 06:56.240
lines, they abandoned their unprofitable freight lines, and they consolidated and

06:56.240 --> 07:02.080
consolidated and consolidated until only four major companies held major claims to American

07:02.080 --> 07:08.880
rails. Things went less well for Amtrak. To its designer's dismay, it didn't turn a profit in its

07:08.880 --> 07:15.760
first four years. In fact, it didn't turn a profit in its first 50 years. Instead, it became a

07:15.760 --> 07:21.760
punching bag. Its brutally slow and infrequent long-distance lines exemplified how far American

07:21.760 --> 07:26.560
infrastructure had fallen, and its lack of punctuality served as a far too common punchline.

07:26.560 --> 07:30.640
Depending on one's political perspective, the part-government, part-private passenger

07:30.640 --> 07:36.080
service's lack of success is a function of too much government intervention, or too little.

07:36.080 --> 07:41.680
But a critical factor in why Amtrak fails to be on time, to be consistent, and to make money is

07:41.680 --> 07:48.320
a function of a tiny bit of legislation everyone has seemed to forget. Between Amtrak's creation

07:48.320 --> 07:53.840
and the further deregulation of freight lines in the 1970s, America passed the Amtrak Improvement

07:53.840 --> 07:59.600
Act of 1973. It wasn't a major piece of legislation, just one of many acts under the same

07:59.600 --> 08:04.320
title that didn't make headlines, but it resolved it would have become a confounding issue between

08:04.320 --> 08:10.480
Amtrak and the railroads—who had preference on the lines. And in no uncertain terms, it solved

08:10.480 --> 08:15.840
the confusion by stating that passenger service had rail preference over freight—effectively,

08:15.840 --> 08:23.760
that people had the right of way. Or it tried to solve the problem. Amtrak thought it solved

08:23.760 --> 08:29.680
the problem. But here's the sticking point—while the law exists on paper, passenger service

08:29.680 --> 08:36.400
priority is rarely granted in practice. Amtrak trains today, and for decades, have been at the

08:36.400 --> 08:42.880
mercy of railroads' erratic, inconsistent, and inconsiderate scheduling. The rail companies

08:42.960 --> 08:47.440
claimed the issues of matter of interpretation, Amtrak points this glaring oversight out time and

08:47.440 --> 08:51.920
time again, while the Department of Justice, which by the letter of the law is the only body that

08:51.920 --> 08:57.040
can initiate any sort of enforcement, has shown no interest in addressing the issue—only ever

08:57.040 --> 09:02.720
initiating one lawsuit on the matter in 1979. Basically, giving the railroads the benefit of

09:02.720 --> 09:08.080
the doubt, their interpretation of the industry-saving bargain's fine print has put American

09:08.080 --> 09:13.760
passenger rail in an impossible bind, but given how they're run, it's hard to give the railroads

09:13.760 --> 09:19.120
the benefit of the doubt. While on the surface freight rail might look like a natural evolution

09:19.120 --> 09:24.480
of its predecessors from a century ago, down below, the industry has reinvented itself as

09:24.480 --> 09:29.920
it's become fixated on a series of seemingly practical, but in actuality misguided operational

09:29.920 --> 09:33.920
metrics that have led its management down a path towards constructing the weakest,

09:33.920 --> 09:38.720
least competitive form of freight rail in American history, and they've taken passenger

09:38.720 --> 09:45.920
rail down with them. For example, gross tonnage per train—the more freight carried per train,

09:45.920 --> 09:52.880
the better, right? Well, longer trains are cheaper to operate—in fact, that's perhaps the paramount

09:52.880 --> 09:57.440
factor in freight rail's incredible cost competitiveness. One can just keep adding and

09:57.440 --> 10:02.240
adding cars, and with each addition, the average operating cost per unit of freight goes down,

10:02.240 --> 10:07.280
as there are few additional marginal costs for added weight or length. This is all true…

10:07.920 --> 10:12.720
in a vacuum. To actually be able to increase their gross tonnage per train,

10:12.720 --> 10:18.720
companies had to simplify. With nearly boundless options of origins and destinations all across the

10:18.720 --> 10:24.320
nation, it was simple math—they had to reduce the number of route permutations so that more traffic

10:24.320 --> 10:30.160
got aggregated into fewer routes. To accomplish that, they took advantage of the newly deregulated

10:30.160 --> 10:35.440
business environment to negotiate massive volume deals and focus on simpler types of freight—and

10:35.440 --> 10:40.240
they got really lucky. You see, as America introduced more and more air pollution

10:40.240 --> 10:45.200
restrictions, coal users increasingly shifted away from dirty Appalachian and Eastern coal,

10:45.200 --> 10:50.160
and increasingly towards so-called clean coal from the West. With that, there was no longer the

10:50.160 --> 10:54.720
sprawling Mississippi River system and its lower-cost barges to compete against—rail

10:54.720 --> 11:00.080
was the only practical way to get the fossil fuel from Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and beyond to the

11:00.640 --> 11:06.880
centers in the East. And coal is the perfect customer. Most mines can easily fill hundreds

11:06.880 --> 11:12.080
of hopper cars within a matter of hours, meaning a given train only has a single origin and a single

11:12.080 --> 11:18.320
destination—no complex, costly, labor-intensive sorting cars and railyards. And even better,

11:18.320 --> 11:24.800
the demand is huge and predictable—often multiple trainloads per day per mine—so today,

11:24.800 --> 11:30.880
some 27% of freight rail tonnage in the US is represented by coal. Through this operational

11:30.880 --> 11:35.360
simplicity, the freight railroads were able to lower their rates far below what trucking could

11:35.360 --> 11:40.800
compete with—they had created a competition-proof market segment, and this methodology could be

11:40.800 --> 11:45.680
replicated elsewhere. In concert with the deregulation of freight rail, America and

11:45.680 --> 11:50.400
others increasingly outsourced manufacturing abroad, and so rather than originating in Ohio

11:50.400 --> 11:55.520
or Indiana or Illinois, consumer goods increasingly originated in Shanghai or Guangzhou

11:55.520 --> 12:00.720
or Ho Chi Minh City, and entered the American supply chain in a small number of massive container

12:00.720 --> 12:06.240
ports. Similar to coal, this simplified operations. The aggregation was already done for them,

12:06.240 --> 12:11.920
as ships dropped off 10 or 15 or 20,000 containers at once, so all the railroads had to do was pick

12:11.920 --> 12:17.440
up a couple hundred of them and point east. It was hub to node rather than node to node,

12:17.440 --> 12:23.120
so costs, like with coal, went down. As capacity was increasingly consumed

12:23.120 --> 12:27.600
by large-volume commodities and intermodal containers, it was no longer the need to serve

12:27.600 --> 12:32.480
the needs of more minor customers—the era of sending a locomotive to haul a couple cars from

12:32.480 --> 12:38.880
a trackside factory to rail yard was over. Volume ruled supreme, so railroads cut costs by closing

12:38.880 --> 12:44.080
smaller branch lines to and from smaller towns—unless, of course, they had mines.

12:44.640 --> 12:49.520
So, the new geography of the rails and the dominance of volume combined to concentrate

12:49.520 --> 12:53.600
and enlarge the traffic on the rails, which made the infrastructure on which it operates

12:53.600 --> 12:59.840
worse and worse again for Amtrak. Today, not only are there more slow-moving freight trains to get

12:59.840 --> 13:04.640
stuck behind, but management's fixation on their all-important gross tonnage per train metric has

13:04.640 --> 13:10.000
meant that they've started running trains that are too long for their own infrastructure. Rail

13:10.000 --> 13:14.720
sidings are specifically built as stoppage points to let one train pass another, like a faster

13:14.720 --> 13:19.520
Amtrak train stuck behind a slower freight, but with the new supersized length, some freight trains

13:19.520 --> 13:24.720
are physically too long for their sidings, meaning there's sometimes no physical way to respect the

13:24.720 --> 13:30.640
already-disregarded Amtrak rail priority. And this is only one so-called productivity metric that has

13:30.640 --> 13:36.800
held Amtrak back. Perhaps above all else, the one that management fixates on most is their operating

13:36.800 --> 13:43.360
ratio—that is, operational expenses divided by operational revenue. Today, across the board,

13:43.360 --> 13:50.560
this is at an all-time low, whereas a decade ago the industry average sat at 71.6%, today it's at

13:50.560 --> 13:57.920
an unbelievable 60.4%. This is heralded by management as a massive success—they've refined

13:57.920 --> 14:03.920
their craft to such an extent that 40 cents of every operational dollar is pure profit.

14:04.720 --> 14:11.840
But here's the thing—it is very, very easy to make long-term sacrifices to boost short-term

14:11.840 --> 14:15.840
profit. Dismantling a line when it's underperforming, even when that line might

14:15.840 --> 14:20.240
become useful again in the future, boosts short-term profits at the expense of long-term

14:20.240 --> 14:24.800
competitiveness against the trucking industry. Deferring track maintenance boosts short-term

14:24.800 --> 14:29.840
profits at the expense of long-term efficiency as operating speeds have to be reduced to assure

14:29.840 --> 14:35.120
safety on poorer quality track. Electing not to expand busy corridors boosts short-term profits

14:35.120 --> 14:39.280
at the expense of long-term revenue due to additional potential traffic not captured.

14:39.840 --> 14:45.520
Freight rail management have made these short-sighted decisions time and time and

14:45.520 --> 14:50.000
time again, extracting value from the infrastructure invested in far before their

14:50.000 --> 14:56.400
time, because that's what the structure incentivizes. Short-sightedness is inherent

14:56.400 --> 15:01.680
to the decision-making process in private industry. Those in charge have an incredibly

15:01.680 --> 15:06.720
short window of time to build a legacy, and infrastructure, at least in the 21st century,

15:06.720 --> 15:12.720
moves slow. This presents a challenge unique to this form of transportation—air, sea,

15:12.720 --> 15:17.200
and road freight all rely on in-route infrastructure that either exists naturally,

15:17.200 --> 15:22.880
or is built by the government. Nobody wants to be the CEO that decides to sacrifice decades of profit

15:22.880 --> 15:28.160
to build a new track to boost revenue 30 years on, when they, their colleagues, and their stock

15:28.160 --> 15:33.440
options will be gone. Everybody wants to be the CEO that boosted stock prices by delivering the

15:33.440 --> 15:39.040
lowest operating ratio in history. Freight rail can do what freight rail wants to do.

15:39.040 --> 15:44.720
It might be a structurally flawed industry, but as a private, deregulated sector, it's their right

15:44.720 --> 15:52.080
to be structurally flawed. But there's still that one, tiny, miniscule law that marries this private,

15:52.160 --> 15:55.840
deregulated sector to the American passenger rail experience.

15:56.400 --> 16:01.440
The tragedy this presents is that Amtrak can get better, but the law it should be better,

16:01.440 --> 16:06.400
but the network on which it operates is owned and managed by a pair of duopolies whose incentives

16:06.400 --> 16:14.560
inherently push them to make the system worse and worse and worse. Opportunity exists today—for

16:14.560 --> 16:20.000
example, the Colorado Front Range. This is one of the strongest unrealized opportunities for

16:20.000 --> 16:25.840
passenger rail in America. Before a futuristic, long-shot world of dedicated high-speed rail

16:25.840 --> 16:30.720
all across the country, the realistic near-term potential on the Front Range is greater than

16:30.720 --> 16:36.560
almost anywhere else. This narrow, linear population corridor has coalesced along

16:36.560 --> 16:40.960
the plains leading up to the dramatic initial ascent of the Rocky Mountains—Pueblo,

16:40.960 --> 16:46.560
Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, and Cheyenne. These cities, in aggregate,

16:46.560 --> 16:52.000
represent one of the fastest-growing regions in America, with 16.7% more people counted in the

16:52.000 --> 16:57.600
2020 census than the 2010, and disproportionately, the influx is driven by the younger demographics

16:57.600 --> 17:02.320
that are most demanding of passenger rail. To boost the case further, the corridor is

17:02.320 --> 17:06.880
home to a sizable collection of colleges with carless young people, and the two largest,

17:06.880 --> 17:12.800
CU Boulder and CSU, sit away from the biggest population center and airport in Denver.

17:12.800 --> 17:18.000
The one major highway connecting it all, Interstate 25, is constantly at capacity,

17:18.000 --> 17:23.280
leading to crippling slowdowns, and the tracks to remedy this all already exist thanks to Union

17:23.280 --> 17:28.640
Pacific and BNSF. Amtrak's already timetabled it out—they think they could run service from

17:28.640 --> 17:33.360
Pueblo to Denver in 2 hours and 43 minutes, then the stretch from Denver to Cheyenne would last

17:33.360 --> 17:39.360
2 hours and 51 minutes—each slightly longer than the 2-hour driving times, but not by much.

17:39.360 --> 17:43.760
Faced with traffic, parking fees, and loss of remote work productivity while driving,

17:43.760 --> 17:49.360
plenty enough would elect to take the train to run 4 per day, according to Amtrak's market analysis.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.240
It's not a perfect step, but it's a step.

17:52.960 --> 17:58.640
Amtrak has already identified dozens of other imperfect steps across the nation.

17:58.640 --> 18:04.160
Three daily trains from San Luis Obispo to San Jose can work today. Two daily trains from Los

18:04.160 --> 18:10.080
Angeles to Las Vegas can work today. Three daily trains from Phoenix to Tucson can work

18:10.080 --> 18:15.120
today. Four daily trains from Chicago to Louisville can work today. Two daily trains

18:15.120 --> 18:20.720
from Atlanta to Nashville can work today. Three daily trains from Chicago to Green Bay can work

18:20.720 --> 18:28.480
today. The tracks exist, the customers exist, the economics exist, but the problem is freight rail.

18:29.200 --> 18:35.200
The track priority law matters. According to Federal Railroad Administration analysis,

18:35.200 --> 18:40.560
improving on-time performance outside of the Northeast Corridor just to 85%, just to a level

18:40.560 --> 18:45.040
that would be considered poor in the rest of the world, would reduce the company's annual operating

18:45.040 --> 18:51.600
loss by 30%. With less loss and more profit, fares could go down, capturing more customers

18:51.600 --> 18:56.960
and more revenue, leading to a virtuous cycle of improvement. But perhaps even more importantly,

18:56.960 --> 19:03.200
in the transportation business, passengers' time matters. The rail development opportunities that

19:03.200 --> 19:08.800
exist today are genuine, but they're narrow. They're not the Northeast Corridor. They're not

19:08.800 --> 19:13.920
going to usurp the airlines. They're a couple trains a day, capturing a couple hundred people

19:13.920 --> 19:19.920
in corridors with millions. They'd serve an incredibly narrow slice of the traveling public—those

19:19.920 --> 19:25.200
few that can be convinced away from flying or driving—and these are those incredibly rare places

19:25.200 --> 19:31.360
where that slice is big enough to justify the trains. So, what can't happen is for that slice

19:31.360 --> 19:37.520
to get smaller. When a three-hour train turns into five, that slice is the slice, and Amtrak

19:37.520 --> 19:44.720
reliability outside of its own tracks in the Northeast is awful. In 2021, of the 15 long-distance

19:44.720 --> 19:50.400
trains traversing America on freight rails, the best on-time rating was 83% on the route from

19:50.400 --> 19:55.920
Chicago to New Orleans. The next best was 62%, then it got worse and worse all the way down to

19:55.920 --> 20:01.680
only 28% of travelers arriving on time on the New Orleans to Los Angeles line. While theoretically

20:01.680 --> 20:06.080
Denver to Cheyenne in just an hour more than driving is a decent proposition for some,

20:06.080 --> 20:10.720
that's only if it's consistent. Getting stuck in a siding for an hour to let a freight train roll

20:10.720 --> 20:15.760
past is the perfect way to turn a skeptical first-timer into a vocal advocate for widening

20:15.760 --> 20:22.400
Interstate 25. Timeliness matters for passengers, but the freight rail industry willingly and

20:22.400 --> 20:28.240
purposefully decided to cede the timely freight market. They decided it was too hard, that

20:28.240 --> 20:33.680
trucking could have that business, and that they would focus on the slow stuff—coal and intermodal

20:33.680 --> 20:38.880
and others. So, they've created a system of infrastructure where timeliness doesn't matter,

20:38.880 --> 20:43.120
where they dispatch trains wherever they want, where they defer maintenance, let tracks go

20:43.120 --> 20:47.600
derelict, and impose speed restrictions, where they fail to expand congested corridors because

20:47.600 --> 20:53.040
the trains will get there when they get there. Increasingly, freight rail and passenger rail

20:53.040 --> 20:57.920
in America are incompatible, but because of that bargain struck decades ago, freight rail

20:57.920 --> 21:02.720
has the infrastructure, and passenger rail must use the infrastructure, so decisions are made

21:02.720 --> 21:07.840
time and time again that manufacture a network that make it harder and harder to get back to

21:07.840 --> 21:14.560
that golden era. The vast majority of Americans want a rail system like Europe or China or Japan,

21:14.560 --> 21:20.480
but that's an incredibly difficult proposition to take on. According to most, it's one we should,

21:20.480 --> 21:27.520
but to start, America can make that imperfect step. It can get just a little bit better before

21:27.520 --> 21:33.520
it gets great—it can use a little momentum to make it easier to get up to speed. But before

21:33.520 --> 21:38.720
anything, the country and its legislature needs to recognize the inherent and increasing

21:38.720 --> 21:44.080
incompatibility of passenger and freight rail. The two industries are at odds,

21:44.080 --> 21:48.960
and for the benefit of both, some sort of change needs to happen so we can stop imagining

21:48.960 --> 21:54.160
and start experiencing again an America where you could just go anywhere by train.

21:55.680 --> 22:00.240
You might remember how back in late November, the US was facing the potential of a crippling

22:00.240 --> 22:04.640
freight rail strike. The contributing factors to this are pretty closely related to what this

22:04.640 --> 22:09.200
video is about. In an effort to cut costs, management has consistently reduced average

22:09.200 --> 22:14.000
staffing per train, and implemented regressive working rules. For example, due to the imprecise

22:14.000 --> 22:17.680
nature in which these railroads are getting run, staff are required to essentially be on

22:17.680 --> 22:22.560
call non-stop for weeks at a time so that once management decides a train needs to go,

22:22.560 --> 22:27.680
there's always someone to drive it without prior planning. Now, the way I stayed up to date and

22:27.680 --> 22:31.600
informed about this dispute, and the potentially catastrophic hit to the US economy that would

22:31.600 --> 22:35.840
have ensued if the Biden administration hadn't forced an agreement, was through our sponsor,
