1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Imagine an America where you could just go anywhere by train—one where one could pick

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,600
from four daily options from Pittsburgh, each arriving in Columbus some six hours on.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,760
One where twice-daily trains left Denver, tracked south, then climbed through the most

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,240
rugged reaches of the Rockies, providing passengers a selection of dozens of destinations

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
that today can only be reached by the most reliable off-roaders. One where the same

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,280
sleeper that left Washington on a Monday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday would pull

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,480
into San Francisco on a Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. One where even Hawaii

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,360
had trains, linking the south of Oahu to its north, stopping at countless coastal communities

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,560
along the way. One where one could go from Indianapolis to Nashville, or Albany to Burlington,

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,560
or Dallas to Denver, or Boise to Spokane, or anywhere to anywhere—an interconnected,

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,760
frequent, reliable, affordable nationwide network where all it took to travel anywhere was a quick

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,760
walk to your town's local station. This America existed. In fact, if you average America out,

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,200
if you examine the country through its most persistent configuration, this is America.

14
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,760
The development of the nation was so deeply intertwined with the development of the railroads

15
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,120
that if anything, today, the blip in time since World War II where automobiles have come to define

16
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,280
the landscape, that's the aberration—trains are the norm. This average configuration of

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,720
America can return, but before, it has to recognize the minor yet monumentally

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,560
meaningful mistake that took it off track and into today's exceptional, irrational reality.

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,320
The rise of American rail was as meteoric as it was chaotic. Bolstered by favorable loans,

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
cheap labor, and with full-fledged federal government support in the form of land grants,

21
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,240
the back half of the 19th century saw American rail mileage nearly double for three consecutive

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,760
decades. The result was a nation quickly over-indexed with a maze of mismatching rails.

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,760
The race for critical market share was rash, bordering on irrational, as companies ran

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,040
redundant rails into cities, dropped rates to bleed others dry, and, in the most extreme cases,

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,240
even took up arms. But the frenzy launched an industry which in turn built a nation.

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
The craze couldn't last. While railroads became the nation's second-largest employer behind

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,520
only agriculture, and nationwide rail mileage would continue upward into the next century,

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,760
the industry began to mature—expansion for the sake of expansion gave way to

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,160
efficiency-focused consolidation. This shift in approach was best epitomized by J.P. Morgan.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,320
In 1869, Morgan entered the industry with the purchase of this—the tiny Albany-Susquehanna

31
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,240
line—but rather than expand lines, he looked to cut unnecessary costs and inefficient practices.

32
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,840
In the following decades, the Gilded Age financier reorganized companies,

33
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,640
ended rate wars, and removed duplicate routings, hoovering up railroad shares as he went.

34
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,080
By 1902, the maneuvering had wrestled Morgan control over an estimated six of all American

35
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,560
railways, streamlining services to maximize gains. While atypically successful, Morgan's focus on

36
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,080
efficiency was hardly unique. As his empire grew, companies like Great Northern experimented with

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,040
route optimization. By employing heavy trains, focusing on maximizing car loads, and only

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,440
running at full capacity, the railroad pulled higher revenue at lower costs—an approach that

39
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,800
made railroads increasingly popular to private investors across the US. Through the expansion

40
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,920
era, the rails had become central to American life. Like post offices and town halls, rail

41
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,800
stations were staples of every downtown, and day to day, the average traveler and business owner

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,480
alike steadfastly relied on trains' consistent, constant availability. Through the consolidation

43
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,040
phase, however, as track gauges standardized, companies merged, and financiers looked to

44
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
maximize profits, rails also became critical wealth-generating machines for the American

45
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,520
capitalist. Effectively then, by centuries close, the rails served two masters with divergent

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,920
purposes—the American public who required their passenger and freight capabilities,

47
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,800
and their investors who poured money in with the expectation that efficiency gains and optimization

48
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,400
would create more money. From the jump, finding the balance between these two purposes was tricky,

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,960
with the arrival of the combustion engine, it became nearly impossible.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,840
The reasons behind American rails decline are well established. Affordable automobiles, improving

51
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,880
roads and highways, and increasing consumerism sent passenger rails plummeting. And it wasn't

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,840
just cars making things worse for the rails, but trucks. Freight now faced its first real

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,160
competition after World War II as American trucking companies operated on interstates,

54
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,800
moving increasingly diverse goods from increasingly dispersed factories to various

55
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,480
alternating locations. Rails simply struggled to match the flexibility and convenience offered by

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,000
the roads. In a car-centric society, passenger service was becoming less viable by the year,

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,440
and while rail was still the king of heavy freight, it would need to make adjustments

58
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,480
in the face of its first real competitor. Yet, while the writing was on the wall,

59
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,640
iconic passenger lines—the Rio Grande Zephyr, the Santa Fe Super Chief,

60
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,320
the Great Northern Empire Builder—continued to run through the 60s. It was entirely counterintuitive.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,520
In a 1967 government report, officials concluded that for every dollar of revenue a carrier would

62
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,880
lose if discontinuing a passenger service, it would save from $1.45 to $2.42 in costs.

63
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,440
But the rails didn't run these routings because they turned a profit—they ran them because they

64
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,080
had to. The Interstate Commerce Commission, established to ensure that the rails continued

65
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
to provide service for the American consumer, in this case by maintaining important travel

66
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,480
corridors, made it practically impossible for railroads to abandon passenger routes

67
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,520
no matter how deeply unprofitable. Since the creation of the ICC in the 1880s,

68
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,360
the rails were closely monitored and heavily regulated. Now, yesterday's safeguards were

69
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,320
choking them out. Railroads cut infrastructure investment, windowed down their lines, entered

70
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,840
risky mergers, and filed for bankruptcy. By the late 60s, the industry was on the verge

71
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,280
of collapse. With a vitally important cog to the American economy on the brink, the federal

72
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,600
government decided to step in. The idea was simple—give the rail companies a chance by getting

73
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,160
out of their way. Through federal grants and loans, the Department of Transportation figured

74
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,800
the government could prop up a public corporation to provide passenger rail rather than counting

75
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,680
on the freight lines to do so. And by maximizing profitable routings in the Northeast Corridor and

76
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,080
elsewhere, they figured, the front-end investment would lead to the service breaking even within

77
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,960
four years. For their side of the bargain, the railroads would hand over their passenger stock,

78
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,800
and would allow the new service to use their rails for a fair rate. In 1970, Nixon signed the Rail

79
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Passenger Service Act, and Amtrak went from concept to reality. Looking back, from an

80
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,400
industry perspective, the Amtrak deal and deregulation worked. Rails shed their passenger

81
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,240
lines, they abandoned their unprofitable freight lines, and they consolidated and

82
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,080
consolidated and consolidated until only four major companies held major claims to American

83
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,880
rails. Things went less well for Amtrak. To its designer's dismay, it didn't turn a profit in its

84
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,760
first four years. In fact, it didn't turn a profit in its first 50 years. Instead, it became a

85
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,760
punching bag. Its brutally slow and infrequent long-distance lines exemplified how far American

86
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,560
infrastructure had fallen, and its lack of punctuality served as a far too common punchline.

87
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,640
Depending on one's political perspective, the part-government, part-private passenger

88
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,080
service's lack of success is a function of too much government intervention, or too little.

89
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,680
But a critical factor in why Amtrak fails to be on time, to be consistent, and to make money is

90
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,320
a function of a tiny bit of legislation everyone has seemed to forget. Between Amtrak's creation

91
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,840
and the further deregulation of freight lines in the 1970s, America passed the Amtrak Improvement

92
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,600
Act of 1973. It wasn't a major piece of legislation, just one of many acts under the same

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,320
title that didn't make headlines, but it resolved it would have become a confounding issue between

94
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,480
Amtrak and the railroads—who had preference on the lines. And in no uncertain terms, it solved

95
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,840
the confusion by stating that passenger service had rail preference over freight—effectively,

96
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:23,760
that people had the right of way. Or it tried to solve the problem. Amtrak thought it solved

97
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:29,680
the problem. But here's the sticking point—while the law exists on paper, passenger service

98
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,400
priority is rarely granted in practice. Amtrak trains today, and for decades, have been at the

99
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,880
mercy of railroads' erratic, inconsistent, and inconsiderate scheduling. The rail companies

100
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,440
claimed the issues of matter of interpretation, Amtrak points this glaring oversight out time and

101
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,920
time again, while the Department of Justice, which by the letter of the law is the only body that

102
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,040
can initiate any sort of enforcement, has shown no interest in addressing the issue—only ever

103
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,720
initiating one lawsuit on the matter in 1979. Basically, giving the railroads the benefit of

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,080
the doubt, their interpretation of the industry-saving bargain's fine print has put American

105
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,760
passenger rail in an impossible bind, but given how they're run, it's hard to give the railroads

106
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,120
the benefit of the doubt. While on the surface freight rail might look like a natural evolution

107
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,480
of its predecessors from a century ago, down below, the industry has reinvented itself as

108
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,920
it's become fixated on a series of seemingly practical, but in actuality misguided operational

109
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
metrics that have led its management down a path towards constructing the weakest,

110
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,720
least competitive form of freight rail in American history, and they've taken passenger

111
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,920
rail down with them. For example, gross tonnage per train—the more freight carried per train,

112
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,880
the better, right? Well, longer trains are cheaper to operate—in fact, that's perhaps the paramount

113
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,440
factor in freight rail's incredible cost competitiveness. One can just keep adding and

114
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,240
adding cars, and with each addition, the average operating cost per unit of freight goes down,

115
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,280
as there are few additional marginal costs for added weight or length. This is all true…

116
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,720
in a vacuum. To actually be able to increase their gross tonnage per train,

117
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,720
companies had to simplify. With nearly boundless options of origins and destinations all across the

118
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,320
nation, it was simple math—they had to reduce the number of route permutations so that more traffic

119
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,160
got aggregated into fewer routes. To accomplish that, they took advantage of the newly deregulated

120
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,440
business environment to negotiate massive volume deals and focus on simpler types of freight—and

121
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
they got really lucky. You see, as America introduced more and more air pollution

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,200
restrictions, coal users increasingly shifted away from dirty Appalachian and Eastern coal,

123
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,160
and increasingly towards so-called clean coal from the West. With that, there was no longer the

124
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,720
sprawling Mississippi River system and its lower-cost barges to compete against—rail

125
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,080
was the only practical way to get the fossil fuel from Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and beyond to the

126
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,880
centers in the East. And coal is the perfect customer. Most mines can easily fill hundreds

127
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,080
of hopper cars within a matter of hours, meaning a given train only has a single origin and a single

128
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:18,320
destination—no complex, costly, labor-intensive sorting cars and railyards. And even better,

129
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,800
the demand is huge and predictable—often multiple trainloads per day per mine—so today,

130
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,880
some 27% of freight rail tonnage in the US is represented by coal. Through this operational

131
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,360
simplicity, the freight railroads were able to lower their rates far below what trucking could

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,800
compete with—they had created a competition-proof market segment, and this methodology could be

133
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,680
replicated elsewhere. In concert with the deregulation of freight rail, America and

134
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,400
others increasingly outsourced manufacturing abroad, and so rather than originating in Ohio

135
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,520
or Indiana or Illinois, consumer goods increasingly originated in Shanghai or Guangzhou

136
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,720
or Ho Chi Minh City, and entered the American supply chain in a small number of massive container

137
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,240
ports. Similar to coal, this simplified operations. The aggregation was already done for them,

138
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,920
as ships dropped off 10 or 15 or 20,000 containers at once, so all the railroads had to do was pick

139
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,440
up a couple hundred of them and point east. It was hub to node rather than node to node,

140
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,120
so costs, like with coal, went down. As capacity was increasingly consumed

141
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,600
by large-volume commodities and intermodal containers, it was no longer the need to serve

142
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,480
the needs of more minor customers—the era of sending a locomotive to haul a couple cars from

143
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,880
a trackside factory to rail yard was over. Volume ruled supreme, so railroads cut costs by closing

144
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,080
smaller branch lines to and from smaller towns—unless, of course, they had mines.

145
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,520
So, the new geography of the rails and the dominance of volume combined to concentrate

146
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,600
and enlarge the traffic on the rails, which made the infrastructure on which it operates

147
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,840
worse and worse again for Amtrak. Today, not only are there more slow-moving freight trains to get

148
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,640
stuck behind, but management's fixation on their all-important gross tonnage per train metric has

149
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:10,000
meant that they've started running trains that are too long for their own infrastructure. Rail

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
sidings are specifically built as stoppage points to let one train pass another, like a faster

151
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,520
Amtrak train stuck behind a slower freight, but with the new supersized length, some freight trains

152
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,720
are physically too long for their sidings, meaning there's sometimes no physical way to respect the

153
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,640
already-disregarded Amtrak rail priority. And this is only one so-called productivity metric that has

154
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,800
held Amtrak back. Perhaps above all else, the one that management fixates on most is their operating

155
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:43,360
ratio—that is, operational expenses divided by operational revenue. Today, across the board,

156
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,560
this is at an all-time low, whereas a decade ago the industry average sat at 71.6%, today it's at

157
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,920
an unbelievable 60.4%. This is heralded by management as a massive success—they've refined

158
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,920
their craft to such an extent that 40 cents of every operational dollar is pure profit.

159
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,840
But here's the thing—it is very, very easy to make long-term sacrifices to boost short-term

160
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,840
profit. Dismantling a line when it's underperforming, even when that line might

161
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,240
become useful again in the future, boosts short-term profits at the expense of long-term

162
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,800
competitiveness against the trucking industry. Deferring track maintenance boosts short-term

163
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,840
profits at the expense of long-term efficiency as operating speeds have to be reduced to assure

164
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:35,120
safety on poorer quality track. Electing not to expand busy corridors boosts short-term profits

165
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,280
at the expense of long-term revenue due to additional potential traffic not captured.

166
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Freight rail management have made these short-sighted decisions time and time and

167
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,000
time again, extracting value from the infrastructure invested in far before their

168
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,400
time, because that's what the structure incentivizes. Short-sightedness is inherent

169
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,680
to the decision-making process in private industry. Those in charge have an incredibly

170
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,720
short window of time to build a legacy, and infrastructure, at least in the 21st century,

171
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,720
moves slow. This presents a challenge unique to this form of transportation—air, sea,

172
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,200
and road freight all rely on in-route infrastructure that either exists naturally,

173
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,880
or is built by the government. Nobody wants to be the CEO that decides to sacrifice decades of profit

174
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,160
to build a new track to boost revenue 30 years on, when they, their colleagues, and their stock

175
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,440
options will be gone. Everybody wants to be the CEO that boosted stock prices by delivering the

176
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,040
lowest operating ratio in history. Freight rail can do what freight rail wants to do.

177
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,720
It might be a structurally flawed industry, but as a private, deregulated sector, it's their right

178
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:52,080
to be structurally flawed. But there's still that one, tiny, miniscule law that marries this private,

179
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,840
deregulated sector to the American passenger rail experience.

180
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,440
The tragedy this presents is that Amtrak can get better, but the law it should be better,

181
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,400
but the network on which it operates is owned and managed by a pair of duopolies whose incentives

182
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:14,560
inherently push them to make the system worse and worse and worse. Opportunity exists today—for

183
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,000
example, the Colorado Front Range. This is one of the strongest unrealized opportunities for

184
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,840
passenger rail in America. Before a futuristic, long-shot world of dedicated high-speed rail

185
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,720
all across the country, the realistic near-term potential on the Front Range is greater than

186
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,560
almost anywhere else. This narrow, linear population corridor has coalesced along

187
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,960
the plains leading up to the dramatic initial ascent of the Rocky Mountains—Pueblo,

188
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,560
Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, and Cheyenne. These cities, in aggregate,

189
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,000
represent one of the fastest-growing regions in America, with 16.7% more people counted in the

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,600
2020 census than the 2010, and disproportionately, the influx is driven by the younger demographics

191
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,320
that are most demanding of passenger rail. To boost the case further, the corridor is

192
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,880
home to a sizable collection of colleges with carless young people, and the two largest,

193
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,800
CU Boulder and CSU, sit away from the biggest population center and airport in Denver.

194
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,000
The one major highway connecting it all, Interstate 25, is constantly at capacity,

195
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,280
leading to crippling slowdowns, and the tracks to remedy this all already exist thanks to Union

196
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,640
Pacific and BNSF. Amtrak's already timetabled it out—they think they could run service from

197
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,360
Pueblo to Denver in 2 hours and 43 minutes, then the stretch from Denver to Cheyenne would last

198
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,360
2 hours and 51 minutes—each slightly longer than the 2-hour driving times, but not by much.

199
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,760
Faced with traffic, parking fees, and loss of remote work productivity while driving,

200
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,360
plenty enough would elect to take the train to run 4 per day, according to Amtrak's market analysis.

201
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,240
It's not a perfect step, but it's a step.

202
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,640
Amtrak has already identified dozens of other imperfect steps across the nation.

203
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,160
Three daily trains from San Luis Obispo to San Jose can work today. Two daily trains from Los

204
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Angeles to Las Vegas can work today. Three daily trains from Phoenix to Tucson can work

205
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,120
today. Four daily trains from Chicago to Louisville can work today. Two daily trains

206
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,720
from Atlanta to Nashville can work today. Three daily trains from Chicago to Green Bay can work

207
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:28,480
today. The tracks exist, the customers exist, the economics exist, but the problem is freight rail.

208
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,200
The track priority law matters. According to Federal Railroad Administration analysis,

209
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,560
improving on-time performance outside of the Northeast Corridor just to 85%, just to a level

210
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,040
that would be considered poor in the rest of the world, would reduce the company's annual operating

211
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:51,600
loss by 30%. With less loss and more profit, fares could go down, capturing more customers

212
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,960
and more revenue, leading to a virtuous cycle of improvement. But perhaps even more importantly,

213
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,200
in the transportation business, passengers' time matters. The rail development opportunities that

214
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,800
exist today are genuine, but they're narrow. They're not the Northeast Corridor. They're not

215
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,920
going to usurp the airlines. They're a couple trains a day, capturing a couple hundred people

216
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,920
in corridors with millions. They'd serve an incredibly narrow slice of the traveling public—those

217
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,200
few that can be convinced away from flying or driving—and these are those incredibly rare places

218
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,360
where that slice is big enough to justify the trains. So, what can't happen is for that slice

219
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,520
to get smaller. When a three-hour train turns into five, that slice is the slice, and Amtrak

220
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:44,720
reliability outside of its own tracks in the Northeast is awful. In 2021, of the 15 long-distance

221
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,400
trains traversing America on freight rails, the best on-time rating was 83% on the route from

222
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,920
Chicago to New Orleans. The next best was 62%, then it got worse and worse all the way down to

223
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,680
only 28% of travelers arriving on time on the New Orleans to Los Angeles line. While theoretically

224
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,080
Denver to Cheyenne in just an hour more than driving is a decent proposition for some,

225
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,720
that's only if it's consistent. Getting stuck in a siding for an hour to let a freight train roll

226
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,760
past is the perfect way to turn a skeptical first-timer into a vocal advocate for widening

227
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,400
Interstate 25. Timeliness matters for passengers, but the freight rail industry willingly and

228
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,240
purposefully decided to cede the timely freight market. They decided it was too hard, that

229
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,680
trucking could have that business, and that they would focus on the slow stuff—coal and intermodal

230
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,880
and others. So, they've created a system of infrastructure where timeliness doesn't matter,

231
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,120
where they dispatch trains wherever they want, where they defer maintenance, let tracks go

232
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,600
derelict, and impose speed restrictions, where they fail to expand congested corridors because

233
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,040
the trains will get there when they get there. Increasingly, freight rail and passenger rail

234
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,920
in America are incompatible, but because of that bargain struck decades ago, freight rail

235
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,720
has the infrastructure, and passenger rail must use the infrastructure, so decisions are made

236
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,840
time and time again that manufacture a network that make it harder and harder to get back to

237
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,560
that golden era. The vast majority of Americans want a rail system like Europe or China or Japan,

238
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,480
but that's an incredibly difficult proposition to take on. According to most, it's one we should,

239
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:27,520
but to start, America can make that imperfect step. It can get just a little bit better before

240
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,520
it gets great—it can use a little momentum to make it easier to get up to speed. But before

241
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,720
anything, the country and its legislature needs to recognize the inherent and increasing

242
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,080
incompatibility of passenger and freight rail. The two industries are at odds,

243
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,960
and for the benefit of both, some sort of change needs to happen so we can stop imagining

244
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,160
and start experiencing again an America where you could just go anywhere by train.

245
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,240
You might remember how back in late November, the US was facing the potential of a crippling

246
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,640
freight rail strike. The contributing factors to this are pretty closely related to what this

247
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,200
video is about. In an effort to cut costs, management has consistently reduced average

248
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,000
staffing per train, and implemented regressive working rules. For example, due to the imprecise

249
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,680
nature in which these railroads are getting run, staff are required to essentially be on

250
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:22,560
call non-stop for weeks at a time so that once management decides a train needs to go,

251
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,680
there's always someone to drive it without prior planning. Now, the way I stayed up to date and

252
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,600
informed about this dispute, and the potentially catastrophic hit to the US economy that would

253
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,840
have ensued if the Biden administration hadn't forced an agreement, was through our sponsor,
