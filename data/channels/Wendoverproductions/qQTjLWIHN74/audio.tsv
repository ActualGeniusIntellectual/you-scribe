0	4880	Imagine an America where you could just go anywhere by train—one where one could pick
4880	9600	from four daily options from Pittsburgh, each arriving in Columbus some six hours on.
9600	13760	One where twice-daily trains left Denver, tracked south, then climbed through the most
13760	18240	rugged reaches of the Rockies, providing passengers a selection of dozens of destinations
18240	22640	that today can only be reached by the most reliable off-roaders. One where the same
22640	27280	sleeper that left Washington on a Monday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday would pull
27280	32480	into San Francisco on a Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. One where even Hawaii
32480	37360	had trains, linking the south of Oahu to its north, stopping at countless coastal communities
37360	42560	along the way. One where one could go from Indianapolis to Nashville, or Albany to Burlington,
42560	48560	or Dallas to Denver, or Boise to Spokane, or anywhere to anywhere—an interconnected,
48560	53760	frequent, reliable, affordable nationwide network where all it took to travel anywhere was a quick
53760	61760	walk to your town's local station. This America existed. In fact, if you average America out,
61760	67200	if you examine the country through its most persistent configuration, this is America.
67200	71760	The development of the nation was so deeply intertwined with the development of the railroads
71760	77120	that if anything, today, the blip in time since World War II where automobiles have come to define
77120	83280	the landscape, that's the aberration—trains are the norm. This average configuration of
83280	88720	America can return, but before, it has to recognize the minor yet monumentally
88720	94560	meaningful mistake that took it off track and into today's exceptional, irrational reality.
94560	100320	The rise of American rail was as meteoric as it was chaotic. Bolstered by favorable loans,
100320	104320	cheap labor, and with full-fledged federal government support in the form of land grants,
104320	110240	the back half of the 19th century saw American rail mileage nearly double for three consecutive
110240	115760	decades. The result was a nation quickly over-indexed with a maze of mismatching rails.
115760	119760	The race for critical market share was rash, bordering on irrational, as companies ran
119760	125040	redundant rails into cities, dropped rates to bleed others dry, and, in the most extreme cases,
125040	130240	even took up arms. But the frenzy launched an industry which in turn built a nation.
130800	135360	The craze couldn't last. While railroads became the nation's second-largest employer behind
135360	139520	only agriculture, and nationwide rail mileage would continue upward into the next century,
139520	143760	the industry began to mature—expansion for the sake of expansion gave way to
143760	150160	efficiency-focused consolidation. This shift in approach was best epitomized by J.P. Morgan.
150160	156320	In 1869, Morgan entered the industry with the purchase of this—the tiny Albany-Susquehanna
156320	162240	line—but rather than expand lines, he looked to cut unnecessary costs and inefficient practices.
162240	165840	In the following decades, the Gilded Age financier reorganized companies,
165920	170640	ended rate wars, and removed duplicate routings, hoovering up railroad shares as he went.
170640	176080	By 1902, the maneuvering had wrestled Morgan control over an estimated six of all American
176080	182560	railways, streamlining services to maximize gains. While atypically successful, Morgan's focus on
182560	188080	efficiency was hardly unique. As his empire grew, companies like Great Northern experimented with
188080	193040	route optimization. By employing heavy trains, focusing on maximizing car loads, and only
193040	197440	running at full capacity, the railroad pulled higher revenue at lower costs—an approach that
197440	202800	made railroads increasingly popular to private investors across the US. Through the expansion
202800	207920	era, the rails had become central to American life. Like post offices and town halls, rail
207920	212800	stations were staples of every downtown, and day to day, the average traveler and business owner
212800	218480	alike steadfastly relied on trains' consistent, constant availability. Through the consolidation
218480	223040	phase, however, as track gauges standardized, companies merged, and financiers looked to
223040	227760	maximize profits, rails also became critical wealth-generating machines for the American
227760	233520	capitalist. Effectively then, by centuries close, the rails served two masters with divergent
233520	237920	purposes—the American public who required their passenger and freight capabilities,
237920	242800	and their investors who poured money in with the expectation that efficiency gains and optimization
242800	248400	would create more money. From the jump, finding the balance between these two purposes was tricky,
248720	252960	with the arrival of the combustion engine, it became nearly impossible.
254000	259840	The reasons behind American rails decline are well established. Affordable automobiles, improving
259840	264880	roads and highways, and increasing consumerism sent passenger rails plummeting. And it wasn't
264880	269840	just cars making things worse for the rails, but trucks. Freight now faced its first real
269840	274160	competition after World War II as American trucking companies operated on interstates,
274160	278800	moving increasingly diverse goods from increasingly dispersed factories to various
278800	284480	alternating locations. Rails simply struggled to match the flexibility and convenience offered by
284480	290000	the roads. In a car-centric society, passenger service was becoming less viable by the year,
290000	293440	and while rail was still the king of heavy freight, it would need to make adjustments
293440	298480	in the face of its first real competitor. Yet, while the writing was on the wall,
298480	302640	iconic passenger lines—the Rio Grande Zephyr, the Santa Fe Super Chief,
302640	308320	the Great Northern Empire Builder—continued to run through the 60s. It was entirely counterintuitive.
308320	313520	In a 1967 government report, officials concluded that for every dollar of revenue a carrier would
313520	320880	lose if discontinuing a passenger service, it would save from $1.45 to $2.42 in costs.
320880	325440	But the rails didn't run these routings because they turned a profit—they ran them because they
325440	330080	had to. The Interstate Commerce Commission, established to ensure that the rails continued
330080	334000	to provide service for the American consumer, in this case by maintaining important travel
334000	338480	corridors, made it practically impossible for railroads to abandon passenger routes
338480	343520	no matter how deeply unprofitable. Since the creation of the ICC in the 1880s,
343520	349360	the rails were closely monitored and heavily regulated. Now, yesterday's safeguards were
349360	354320	choking them out. Railroads cut infrastructure investment, windowed down their lines, entered
354320	359840	risky mergers, and filed for bankruptcy. By the late 60s, the industry was on the verge
359840	365280	of collapse. With a vitally important cog to the American economy on the brink, the federal
365280	371600	government decided to step in. The idea was simple—give the rail companies a chance by getting
371600	376160	out of their way. Through federal grants and loans, the Department of Transportation figured
376160	380800	the government could prop up a public corporation to provide passenger rail rather than counting
380800	385680	on the freight lines to do so. And by maximizing profitable routings in the Northeast Corridor and
385680	390080	elsewhere, they figured, the front-end investment would lead to the service breaking even within
390080	394960	four years. For their side of the bargain, the railroads would hand over their passenger stock,
394960	400800	and would allow the new service to use their rails for a fair rate. In 1970, Nixon signed the Rail
400800	406800	Passenger Service Act, and Amtrak went from concept to reality. Looking back, from an
406800	412400	industry perspective, the Amtrak deal and deregulation worked. Rails shed their passenger
412400	416240	lines, they abandoned their unprofitable freight lines, and they consolidated and
416240	422080	consolidated and consolidated until only four major companies held major claims to American
422080	428880	rails. Things went less well for Amtrak. To its designer's dismay, it didn't turn a profit in its
428880	435760	first four years. In fact, it didn't turn a profit in its first 50 years. Instead, it became a
435760	441760	punching bag. Its brutally slow and infrequent long-distance lines exemplified how far American
441760	446560	infrastructure had fallen, and its lack of punctuality served as a far too common punchline.
446560	450640	Depending on one's political perspective, the part-government, part-private passenger
450640	456080	service's lack of success is a function of too much government intervention, or too little.
456080	461680	But a critical factor in why Amtrak fails to be on time, to be consistent, and to make money is
461680	468320	a function of a tiny bit of legislation everyone has seemed to forget. Between Amtrak's creation
468320	473840	and the further deregulation of freight lines in the 1970s, America passed the Amtrak Improvement
473840	479600	Act of 1973. It wasn't a major piece of legislation, just one of many acts under the same
479600	484320	title that didn't make headlines, but it resolved it would have become a confounding issue between
484320	490480	Amtrak and the railroads—who had preference on the lines. And in no uncertain terms, it solved
490480	495840	the confusion by stating that passenger service had rail preference over freight—effectively,
495840	503760	that people had the right of way. Or it tried to solve the problem. Amtrak thought it solved
503760	509680	the problem. But here's the sticking point—while the law exists on paper, passenger service
509680	516400	priority is rarely granted in practice. Amtrak trains today, and for decades, have been at the
516400	522880	mercy of railroads' erratic, inconsistent, and inconsiderate scheduling. The rail companies
522960	527440	claimed the issues of matter of interpretation, Amtrak points this glaring oversight out time and
527440	531920	time again, while the Department of Justice, which by the letter of the law is the only body that
531920	537040	can initiate any sort of enforcement, has shown no interest in addressing the issue—only ever
537040	542720	initiating one lawsuit on the matter in 1979. Basically, giving the railroads the benefit of
542720	548080	the doubt, their interpretation of the industry-saving bargain's fine print has put American
548080	553760	passenger rail in an impossible bind, but given how they're run, it's hard to give the railroads
553760	559120	the benefit of the doubt. While on the surface freight rail might look like a natural evolution
559120	564480	of its predecessors from a century ago, down below, the industry has reinvented itself as
564480	569920	it's become fixated on a series of seemingly practical, but in actuality misguided operational
569920	573920	metrics that have led its management down a path towards constructing the weakest,
573920	578720	least competitive form of freight rail in American history, and they've taken passenger
578720	585920	rail down with them. For example, gross tonnage per train—the more freight carried per train,
585920	592880	the better, right? Well, longer trains are cheaper to operate—in fact, that's perhaps the paramount
592880	597440	factor in freight rail's incredible cost competitiveness. One can just keep adding and
597440	602240	adding cars, and with each addition, the average operating cost per unit of freight goes down,
602240	607280	as there are few additional marginal costs for added weight or length. This is all true…
607920	612720	in a vacuum. To actually be able to increase their gross tonnage per train,
612720	618720	companies had to simplify. With nearly boundless options of origins and destinations all across the
618720	624320	nation, it was simple math—they had to reduce the number of route permutations so that more traffic
624320	630160	got aggregated into fewer routes. To accomplish that, they took advantage of the newly deregulated
630160	635440	business environment to negotiate massive volume deals and focus on simpler types of freight—and
635440	640240	they got really lucky. You see, as America introduced more and more air pollution
640240	645200	restrictions, coal users increasingly shifted away from dirty Appalachian and Eastern coal,
645200	650160	and increasingly towards so-called clean coal from the West. With that, there was no longer the
650160	654720	sprawling Mississippi River system and its lower-cost barges to compete against—rail
654720	660080	was the only practical way to get the fossil fuel from Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and beyond to the
660640	666880	centers in the East. And coal is the perfect customer. Most mines can easily fill hundreds
666880	672080	of hopper cars within a matter of hours, meaning a given train only has a single origin and a single
672080	678320	destination—no complex, costly, labor-intensive sorting cars and railyards. And even better,
678320	684800	the demand is huge and predictable—often multiple trainloads per day per mine—so today,
684800	690880	some 27% of freight rail tonnage in the US is represented by coal. Through this operational
690880	695360	simplicity, the freight railroads were able to lower their rates far below what trucking could
695360	700800	compete with—they had created a competition-proof market segment, and this methodology could be
700800	705680	replicated elsewhere. In concert with the deregulation of freight rail, America and
705680	710400	others increasingly outsourced manufacturing abroad, and so rather than originating in Ohio
710400	715520	or Indiana or Illinois, consumer goods increasingly originated in Shanghai or Guangzhou
715520	720720	or Ho Chi Minh City, and entered the American supply chain in a small number of massive container
720720	726240	ports. Similar to coal, this simplified operations. The aggregation was already done for them,
726240	731920	as ships dropped off 10 or 15 or 20,000 containers at once, so all the railroads had to do was pick
731920	737440	up a couple hundred of them and point east. It was hub to node rather than node to node,
737440	743120	so costs, like with coal, went down. As capacity was increasingly consumed
743120	747600	by large-volume commodities and intermodal containers, it was no longer the need to serve
747600	752480	the needs of more minor customers—the era of sending a locomotive to haul a couple cars from
752480	758880	a trackside factory to rail yard was over. Volume ruled supreme, so railroads cut costs by closing
758880	764080	smaller branch lines to and from smaller towns—unless, of course, they had mines.
764640	769520	So, the new geography of the rails and the dominance of volume combined to concentrate
769520	773600	and enlarge the traffic on the rails, which made the infrastructure on which it operates
773600	779840	worse and worse again for Amtrak. Today, not only are there more slow-moving freight trains to get
779840	784640	stuck behind, but management's fixation on their all-important gross tonnage per train metric has
784640	790000	meant that they've started running trains that are too long for their own infrastructure. Rail
790000	794720	sidings are specifically built as stoppage points to let one train pass another, like a faster
794720	799520	Amtrak train stuck behind a slower freight, but with the new supersized length, some freight trains
799520	804720	are physically too long for their sidings, meaning there's sometimes no physical way to respect the
804720	810640	already-disregarded Amtrak rail priority. And this is only one so-called productivity metric that has
810640	816800	held Amtrak back. Perhaps above all else, the one that management fixates on most is their operating
816800	823360	ratio—that is, operational expenses divided by operational revenue. Today, across the board,
823360	830560	this is at an all-time low, whereas a decade ago the industry average sat at 71.6%, today it's at
830560	837920	an unbelievable 60.4%. This is heralded by management as a massive success—they've refined
837920	843920	their craft to such an extent that 40 cents of every operational dollar is pure profit.
844720	851840	But here's the thing—it is very, very easy to make long-term sacrifices to boost short-term
851840	855840	profit. Dismantling a line when it's underperforming, even when that line might
855840	860240	become useful again in the future, boosts short-term profits at the expense of long-term
860240	864800	competitiveness against the trucking industry. Deferring track maintenance boosts short-term
864800	869840	profits at the expense of long-term efficiency as operating speeds have to be reduced to assure
869840	875120	safety on poorer quality track. Electing not to expand busy corridors boosts short-term profits
875120	879280	at the expense of long-term revenue due to additional potential traffic not captured.
879840	885520	Freight rail management have made these short-sighted decisions time and time and
885520	890000	time again, extracting value from the infrastructure invested in far before their
890000	896400	time, because that's what the structure incentivizes. Short-sightedness is inherent
896400	901680	to the decision-making process in private industry. Those in charge have an incredibly
901680	906720	short window of time to build a legacy, and infrastructure, at least in the 21st century,
906720	912720	moves slow. This presents a challenge unique to this form of transportation—air, sea,
912720	917200	and road freight all rely on in-route infrastructure that either exists naturally,
917200	922880	or is built by the government. Nobody wants to be the CEO that decides to sacrifice decades of profit
922880	928160	to build a new track to boost revenue 30 years on, when they, their colleagues, and their stock
928160	933440	options will be gone. Everybody wants to be the CEO that boosted stock prices by delivering the
933440	939040	lowest operating ratio in history. Freight rail can do what freight rail wants to do.
939040	944720	It might be a structurally flawed industry, but as a private, deregulated sector, it's their right
944720	952080	to be structurally flawed. But there's still that one, tiny, miniscule law that marries this private,
952160	955840	deregulated sector to the American passenger rail experience.
956400	961440	The tragedy this presents is that Amtrak can get better, but the law it should be better,
961440	966400	but the network on which it operates is owned and managed by a pair of duopolies whose incentives
966400	974560	inherently push them to make the system worse and worse and worse. Opportunity exists today—for
974560	980000	example, the Colorado Front Range. This is one of the strongest unrealized opportunities for
980000	985840	passenger rail in America. Before a futuristic, long-shot world of dedicated high-speed rail
985840	990720	all across the country, the realistic near-term potential on the Front Range is greater than
990720	996560	almost anywhere else. This narrow, linear population corridor has coalesced along
996560	1000960	the plains leading up to the dramatic initial ascent of the Rocky Mountains—Pueblo,
1000960	1006560	Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins, and Cheyenne. These cities, in aggregate,
1006560	1012000	represent one of the fastest-growing regions in America, with 16.7% more people counted in the
1012000	1017600	2020 census than the 2010, and disproportionately, the influx is driven by the younger demographics
1017600	1022320	that are most demanding of passenger rail. To boost the case further, the corridor is
1022320	1026880	home to a sizable collection of colleges with carless young people, and the two largest,
1026880	1032800	CU Boulder and CSU, sit away from the biggest population center and airport in Denver.
1032800	1038000	The one major highway connecting it all, Interstate 25, is constantly at capacity,
1038000	1043280	leading to crippling slowdowns, and the tracks to remedy this all already exist thanks to Union
1043280	1048640	Pacific and BNSF. Amtrak's already timetabled it out—they think they could run service from
1048640	1053360	Pueblo to Denver in 2 hours and 43 minutes, then the stretch from Denver to Cheyenne would last
1053360	1059360	2 hours and 51 minutes—each slightly longer than the 2-hour driving times, but not by much.
1059360	1063760	Faced with traffic, parking fees, and loss of remote work productivity while driving,
1063760	1069360	plenty enough would elect to take the train to run 4 per day, according to Amtrak's market analysis.
1069920	1072240	It's not a perfect step, but it's a step.
1072960	1078640	Amtrak has already identified dozens of other imperfect steps across the nation.
1078640	1084160	Three daily trains from San Luis Obispo to San Jose can work today. Two daily trains from Los
1084160	1090080	Angeles to Las Vegas can work today. Three daily trains from Phoenix to Tucson can work
1090080	1095120	today. Four daily trains from Chicago to Louisville can work today. Two daily trains
1095120	1100720	from Atlanta to Nashville can work today. Three daily trains from Chicago to Green Bay can work
1100720	1108480	today. The tracks exist, the customers exist, the economics exist, but the problem is freight rail.
1109200	1115200	The track priority law matters. According to Federal Railroad Administration analysis,
1115200	1120560	improving on-time performance outside of the Northeast Corridor just to 85%, just to a level
1120560	1125040	that would be considered poor in the rest of the world, would reduce the company's annual operating
1125040	1131600	loss by 30%. With less loss and more profit, fares could go down, capturing more customers
1131600	1136960	and more revenue, leading to a virtuous cycle of improvement. But perhaps even more importantly,
1136960	1143200	in the transportation business, passengers' time matters. The rail development opportunities that
1143200	1148800	exist today are genuine, but they're narrow. They're not the Northeast Corridor. They're not
1148800	1153920	going to usurp the airlines. They're a couple trains a day, capturing a couple hundred people
1153920	1159920	in corridors with millions. They'd serve an incredibly narrow slice of the traveling public—those
1159920	1165200	few that can be convinced away from flying or driving—and these are those incredibly rare places
1165200	1171360	where that slice is big enough to justify the trains. So, what can't happen is for that slice
1171360	1177520	to get smaller. When a three-hour train turns into five, that slice is the slice, and Amtrak
1177520	1184720	reliability outside of its own tracks in the Northeast is awful. In 2021, of the 15 long-distance
1184720	1190400	trains traversing America on freight rails, the best on-time rating was 83% on the route from
1190400	1195920	Chicago to New Orleans. The next best was 62%, then it got worse and worse all the way down to
1195920	1201680	only 28% of travelers arriving on time on the New Orleans to Los Angeles line. While theoretically
1201680	1206080	Denver to Cheyenne in just an hour more than driving is a decent proposition for some,
1206080	1210720	that's only if it's consistent. Getting stuck in a siding for an hour to let a freight train roll
1210720	1215760	past is the perfect way to turn a skeptical first-timer into a vocal advocate for widening
1215760	1222400	Interstate 25. Timeliness matters for passengers, but the freight rail industry willingly and
1222400	1228240	purposefully decided to cede the timely freight market. They decided it was too hard, that
1228240	1233680	trucking could have that business, and that they would focus on the slow stuff—coal and intermodal
1233680	1238880	and others. So, they've created a system of infrastructure where timeliness doesn't matter,
1238880	1243120	where they dispatch trains wherever they want, where they defer maintenance, let tracks go
1243120	1247600	derelict, and impose speed restrictions, where they fail to expand congested corridors because
1247600	1253040	the trains will get there when they get there. Increasingly, freight rail and passenger rail
1253040	1257920	in America are incompatible, but because of that bargain struck decades ago, freight rail
1257920	1262720	has the infrastructure, and passenger rail must use the infrastructure, so decisions are made
1262720	1267840	time and time again that manufacture a network that make it harder and harder to get back to
1267840	1274560	that golden era. The vast majority of Americans want a rail system like Europe or China or Japan,
1274560	1280480	but that's an incredibly difficult proposition to take on. According to most, it's one we should,
1280480	1287520	but to start, America can make that imperfect step. It can get just a little bit better before
1287520	1293520	it gets great—it can use a little momentum to make it easier to get up to speed. But before
1293520	1298720	anything, the country and its legislature needs to recognize the inherent and increasing
1298720	1304080	incompatibility of passenger and freight rail. The two industries are at odds,
1304080	1308960	and for the benefit of both, some sort of change needs to happen so we can stop imagining
1308960	1314160	and start experiencing again an America where you could just go anywhere by train.
1315680	1320240	You might remember how back in late November, the US was facing the potential of a crippling
1320240	1324640	freight rail strike. The contributing factors to this are pretty closely related to what this
1324640	1329200	video is about. In an effort to cut costs, management has consistently reduced average
1329200	1334000	staffing per train, and implemented regressive working rules. For example, due to the imprecise
1334000	1337680	nature in which these railroads are getting run, staff are required to essentially be on
1337680	1342560	call non-stop for weeks at a time so that once management decides a train needs to go,
1342560	1347680	there's always someone to drive it without prior planning. Now, the way I stayed up to date and
1347680	1351600	informed about this dispute, and the potentially catastrophic hit to the US economy that would
1351600	1355840	have ensued if the Biden administration hadn't forced an agreement, was through our sponsor,
