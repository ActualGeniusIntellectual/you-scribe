1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Moon colonization is something that humans have dreamt about for centuries and it's

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,400
entirely possible it's just a matter of cost.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,840
Bringing both humans and supplies the 234,000 miles to the lunar surface costs an enormous

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,800
amount of money and it's difficult to justify the cost to taxpayers.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
So how much would it cost?

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,860
Well that's a complicated question.

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,440
For the sake of simplicity, let's say we're doing a one year return mission with four

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,720
astronauts using NASA technology.

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,560
The first thing we'll calculate is the cost of getting there and we'll need a rocket.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,960
The Saturn V is the only rocket to have ever existed that is powerful enough to take humans

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,460
beyond low earth orbit.

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,240
The problem is, all 15 of them are long retired.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,240
The Saturn V had a lunar payload capacity of 90,000 pounds and a per launch cost of

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:51,540
$189,000,000 1971 dollars or $1,123,000,000 2016 dollars which works out to $12,500 per

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,420
pound transported to the moon.

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,900
That may seem like a lot, but that would mean that the average American, weighing 159 pounds,

17
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,980
could travel to the moon on technology that existed when computers looked like this for

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,020
a mere $2,000,000.

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,860
I know you know that that's not right.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,300
There are two problems in that calculation.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,040
First off, that doesn't include research and development costs.

22
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,780
A staggering $6.4 billion was spent to develop the Saturn V which is $38,000,000,000 in 2016

23
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,780
dollars.

24
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,860
So, considering that the Saturn V was launched 13 times, that works out to just over $4,000,000

25
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,920
per launch or $44,000 per pound.

26
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,040
To colonize the moon, you don't just need to get things to the moon, you need to get

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,540
them on the moon.

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,660
The budget allocated to develop and build 12 lunar landers back in the Apollo days was

29
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,280
$18,000,000,000 2016 dollars or $1,500,000,000 per lander.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,440
Once again, the lunar landers are no longer in service so we're including the R&D costs

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,800
in our calculations.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,760
We need two landers to bring our four astronauts to the moon and these have to be able to return

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,800
so they need to land with both launch systems and fuel.

34
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,380
So that's $1.5 billion per lander plus $4 billion per Saturn V launch so $11 billion

35
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,220
total to carry our astronauts to the moon and back.

36
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,440
During the Apollo days, NASA also developed a module called the LM truck which was designed

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,600
to deliver payloads to the surface of the moon without a crew.

38
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,520
Not only could these land with 11,000 pounds of cargo, but a Saturn V rocket could launch

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,880
with two of them.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,160
Using the truck, we can bring our per pound cost of bringing cargo to the lunar surface

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,040
down to a reasonable $318,000.

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Believe it or not, that's a bargain.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
So, once our four astronauts get to the moon, they need somewhere to live.

44
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,320
The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC did a super detailed

45
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,520
study on how much the development and construction of a lunar base would cost.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,600
For our four person base, it would cost $20 billion to develop plus one of our $4 billion

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,360
launches equaling $24 billion.

48
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,800
That's a little steep.

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,360
For a budget option, we could go with something like Bigelow Airspace's B330 spacecraft.

50
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,720
These are essentially inflatable buildings that work in space and with a bit of modification,

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,560
they could conceivably be altered to work on the surface of the moon.

52
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
Bigelow Airspace is a commercial company.

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,360
They've said that the B330 would rent out for $1.25 million per day or $465 million

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
for a one year mission.

55
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,520
Considering that's the first time I've said million when talking about a current

56
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,200
day cost, that's practically nothing.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,320
Until you consider the problem of getting the B330 to the moon, it weighs 43,000 pounds

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,600
so it'd take four LM truck landings and two Saturn V launches for a total of $14 billion.

59
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,440
Well, that's a little better than $24 billion.

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,220
Let's move on to food.

61
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:29,840
For food, the best, but not simplest solution is to just grow it.

62
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,440
One lunar greenhouse developed by the University of Arizona could produce about 5.5 pounds

63
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,660
of food per day.

64
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:39,300
In order to have variety, NASA would probably choose a few different crops that would do

65
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,720
well on the moon.

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,040
For our calculations, we'll say that the greenhouse would be filled with 76% sweet

67
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,400
potato, 16% tomato, and 10% strawberry.

68
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,800
That'll come out to 4.3 pounds of sweet potato, .8 pounds of tomato, and .4 pounds

69
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,380
of strawberries per day.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,660
Sweet potatoes have 389 calories per pound or 1,675 calories per day per greenhouse.

71
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,400
The tomatoes and strawberries will make 65 and 60 calories per day per greenhouse respectively,

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,520
so that's 1,800 calories per day per greenhouse total.

73
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,720
Each of our four astronauts would need about 3,000 calories per day equaling 12,000 total

74
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,640
per day, so we'll need 6.67 greenhouses total and since you can't really bring two

75
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,600
thirds of a greenhouse, we'll bring 7 and have surplus food, which is great for backup.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Each lunar greenhouse will require .2 pounds of fertilizer per day, which adds up to 1.4

77
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,480
pounds of fertilizer per day for our 7 greenhouses and 510 pounds for the year.

78
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,200
So, for the greenhouse's growing scheme, we'll need to physically bring the greenhouses

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:38,480
which each weigh a full metric ton or 2,200 pounds which, for the 7 of them, is 15,400

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:44,160
pounds or 4.9 billion dollars plus another 162 million dollars for fertilizer.

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,880
The International Space Station is a really good example of how water resources could

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,240
be managed on the moon.

83
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,680
Every bit used on the ISS is recycled.

84
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,360
That includes water from condensation, showers, sweat, and yes, urine.

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,960
It of course gets filtered heavily, but the water in astronauts food is the same that

86
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,080
came from, you know, other stuff.

87
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,320
NASA says that, without water recycling, 40,000 pounds of water would be needed to sustain

88
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,680
4 astronauts on the moon.

89
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,040
That would cost $12.7 billion dollars to transport.

90
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:18,040
With water recycling, we can bring that down to 5,110 pounds of water for the year.

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,600
Except we have our greenhouse, quite a bit of water is needed to grow the plants—6,920

92
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
pounds worth to be specific.

93
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,440
So that's 12,030 pounds of water for the year, which would cost $3.825 billion dollars

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
to bring.

95
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,920
So, next we need air, as in oxygen to breathe.

96
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,320
A human at moderate activity levels needs 1.85 pounds of oxygen per day.

97
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,740
So that means we'd need 7.4 pounds of oxygen per day for our four astronauts, 2,701 pounds

98
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,640
for the year, which would cost $860 million dollars.

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,700
But wait, because of our greenhouses and the amazing process of photosynthesis, we don't.

100
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,220
One lunar greenhouse produces .75 pounds of oxygen per day.

101
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,920
So our seven create 5.25 pounds of oxygen each day, so we only need to bring 2.15 pounds

102
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,120
of oxygen per day or 785 pounds for the year, which will cost a mere $250 million dollars.

103
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,760
You may ask why we don't use an oxygen scrubber and the simple answer is that it would cost

104
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,080
quite a bit more to develop, build, and deliver a scrubber capable of creating enough clean

105
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,360
air for a crew of four.

106
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,580
It's just cheaper and less risky to bring all the necessary oxygen there.

107
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,040
In terms of power, it's been proposed that the best way to bring electricity to the moon

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,080
is to literally bring a nuclear reactor.

109
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,160
It'd be a little one, but it would carry out fission reactions on the surface of the

110
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,160
moon.

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,000
NASA has only proposed, not developed, this system, but they said it could be developed,

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,080
flight tested, and delivered to the moon for only $1.4 billion dollars.

113
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,800
Now we have everything we need.

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,120
So, to answer the question you came here for, how much would it cost to live a year on the

115
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
moon?

116
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,460
I'll just say before giving my answer that these were all estimates and far from perfect.

117
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,960
For example, it's likely that if NASA ever actually colonized the moon, it would be decades

118
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,320
in the future when commercial space companies are far more developed and the cost of transport

119
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,640
would be much less.

120
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,840
Space Flight Industries already sells cargo space to lunar orbit for a mere $10 million

121
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,720
dollars per 220 pounds.

122
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,800
With prices that low, it may not be long until living on the moon and other celestial bodies

123
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,160
becomes commercially advantageous through mining and tourism.

124
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,420
The very day this video goes up, Elon Musk is anticipated to announce SpaceX's plans

125
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:25,040
to get to Mars, including a massive rocket that'll be able to carry as many as 220,000

126
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,440
pounds to Mars for less than any previous rocket, which could make Martian colonization

127
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,800
economically feasible.

128
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,160
So, after adding everything up, my conservative estimate for one year with four astronauts

129
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,680
on the moon comes out to $36 billion dollars.

130
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:50,720
That's $98 million per day, $4.1 million per hour, $68,300 per minute, or $1,138 per

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,400
second—more than an average family makes in a year in Madagascar.

132
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,760
Is it worth it?

133
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Maybe.

134
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,360
If we ever have to leave earth because of the environmental change that we've started,

135
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,400
that $36 billion dollars might be the best investment we've ever made.

136
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,880
After all, living on the moon or Mars or some other celestial body is a crucial first step

137
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,960
in learning how to survive when the earth is no longer.

138
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,500
