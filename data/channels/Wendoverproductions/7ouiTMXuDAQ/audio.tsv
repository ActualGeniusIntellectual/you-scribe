0	4400	Moon colonization is something that humans have dreamt about for centuries and it's
4400	7400	entirely possible it's just a matter of cost.
7400	12840	Bringing both humans and supplies the 234,000 miles to the lunar surface costs an enormous
12840	16800	amount of money and it's difficult to justify the cost to taxpayers.
16800	18400	So how much would it cost?
18400	19860	Well that's a complicated question.
19860	23440	For the sake of simplicity, let's say we're doing a one year return mission with four
23440	25720	astronauts using NASA technology.
25720	29560	The first thing we'll calculate is the cost of getting there and we'll need a rocket.
29560	33960	The Saturn V is the only rocket to have ever existed that is powerful enough to take humans
33960	35460	beyond low earth orbit.
35460	38240	The problem is, all 15 of them are long retired.
38240	43240	The Saturn V had a lunar payload capacity of 90,000 pounds and a per launch cost of
43240	51540	$189,000,000 1971 dollars or $1,123,000,000 2016 dollars which works out to $12,500 per
51540	53420	pound transported to the moon.
53420	57900	That may seem like a lot, but that would mean that the average American, weighing 159 pounds,
57900	61980	could travel to the moon on technology that existed when computers looked like this for
61980	64020	a mere $2,000,000.
64020	65860	I know you know that that's not right.
65860	68300	There are two problems in that calculation.
68300	71040	First off, that doesn't include research and development costs.
71040	77780	A staggering $6.4 billion was spent to develop the Saturn V which is $38,000,000,000 in 2016
77780	78780	dollars.
78780	83860	So, considering that the Saturn V was launched 13 times, that works out to just over $4,000,000
83860	86920	per launch or $44,000 per pound.
87160	91040	To colonize the moon, you don't just need to get things to the moon, you need to get
91040	92540	them on the moon.
92540	96660	The budget allocated to develop and build 12 lunar landers back in the Apollo days was
96660	101280	$18,000,000,000 2016 dollars or $1,500,000,000 per lander.
101280	105440	Once again, the lunar landers are no longer in service so we're including the R&D costs
105440	106800	in our calculations.
106800	110760	We need two landers to bring our four astronauts to the moon and these have to be able to return
110760	113800	so they need to land with both launch systems and fuel.
113800	118380	So that's $1.5 billion per lander plus $4 billion per Saturn V launch so $11 billion
118380	121220	total to carry our astronauts to the moon and back.
121220	125440	During the Apollo days, NASA also developed a module called the LM truck which was designed
125440	128600	to deliver payloads to the surface of the moon without a crew.
128600	133520	Not only could these land with 11,000 pounds of cargo, but a Saturn V rocket could launch
133520	134880	with two of them.
134880	139160	Using the truck, we can bring our per pound cost of bringing cargo to the lunar surface
139160	142040	down to a reasonable $318,000.
142080	144080	Believe it or not, that's a bargain.
144080	147920	So, once our four astronauts get to the moon, they need somewhere to live.
147920	152320	The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC did a super detailed
152320	156520	study on how much the development and construction of a lunar base would cost.
156520	161600	For our four person base, it would cost $20 billion to develop plus one of our $4 billion
161600	163360	launches equaling $24 billion.
163360	164800	That's a little steep.
164800	169360	For a budget option, we could go with something like Bigelow Airspace's B330 spacecraft.
169360	173720	These are essentially inflatable buildings that work in space and with a bit of modification,
173720	176560	they could conceivably be altered to work on the surface of the moon.
176560	178720	Bigelow Airspace is a commercial company.
178720	184360	They've said that the B330 would rent out for $1.25 million per day or $465 million
184360	185840	for a one year mission.
185840	188520	Considering that's the first time I've said million when talking about a current
188520	191200	day cost, that's practically nothing.
191200	196320	Until you consider the problem of getting the B330 to the moon, it weighs 43,000 pounds
196320	201600	so it'd take four LM truck landings and two Saturn V launches for a total of $14 billion.
201600	204440	Well, that's a little better than $24 billion.
204440	206220	Let's move on to food.
206220	209840	For food, the best, but not simplest solution is to just grow it.
209840	214440	One lunar greenhouse developed by the University of Arizona could produce about 5.5 pounds
214440	215660	of food per day.
215660	219300	In order to have variety, NASA would probably choose a few different crops that would do
219300	220720	well on the moon.
220720	224040	For our calculations, we'll say that the greenhouse would be filled with 76% sweet
224040	227400	potato, 16% tomato, and 10% strawberry.
227400	231800	That'll come out to 4.3 pounds of sweet potato, .8 pounds of tomato, and .4 pounds
231800	233380	of strawberries per day.
233380	239660	Sweet potatoes have 389 calories per pound or 1,675 calories per day per greenhouse.
239660	244400	The tomatoes and strawberries will make 65 and 60 calories per day per greenhouse respectively,
244400	247520	so that's 1,800 calories per day per greenhouse total.
247520	251720	Each of our four astronauts would need about 3,000 calories per day equaling 12,000 total
251720	255640	per day, so we'll need 6.67 greenhouses total and since you can't really bring two
255640	259600	thirds of a greenhouse, we'll bring 7 and have surplus food, which is great for backup.
259600	264280	Each lunar greenhouse will require .2 pounds of fertilizer per day, which adds up to 1.4
264280	268480	pounds of fertilizer per day for our 7 greenhouses and 510 pounds for the year.
268480	272200	So, for the greenhouse's growing scheme, we'll need to physically bring the greenhouses
272200	278480	which each weigh a full metric ton or 2,200 pounds which, for the 7 of them, is 15,400
278480	284160	pounds or 4.9 billion dollars plus another 162 million dollars for fertilizer.
284160	287880	The International Space Station is a really good example of how water resources could
287880	289240	be managed on the moon.
289240	291680	Every bit used on the ISS is recycled.
291680	296360	That includes water from condensation, showers, sweat, and yes, urine.
296360	299960	It of course gets filtered heavily, but the water in astronauts food is the same that
299960	303080	came from, you know, other stuff.
303080	308320	NASA says that, without water recycling, 40,000 pounds of water would be needed to sustain
308320	309680	4 astronauts on the moon.
309680	313040	That would cost $12.7 billion dollars to transport.
313040	318040	With water recycling, we can bring that down to 5,110 pounds of water for the year.
318040	323600	Except we have our greenhouse, quite a bit of water is needed to grow the plants—6,920
323600	324600	pounds worth to be specific.
324600	330440	So that's 12,030 pounds of water for the year, which would cost $3.825 billion dollars
330440	331440	to bring.
331440	334920	So, next we need air, as in oxygen to breathe.
334920	339320	A human at moderate activity levels needs 1.85 pounds of oxygen per day.
339320	344740	So that means we'd need 7.4 pounds of oxygen per day for our four astronauts, 2,701 pounds
344740	347640	for the year, which would cost $860 million dollars.
347640	352700	But wait, because of our greenhouses and the amazing process of photosynthesis, we don't.
352700	356220	One lunar greenhouse produces .75 pounds of oxygen per day.
356220	361920	So our seven create 5.25 pounds of oxygen each day, so we only need to bring 2.15 pounds
361920	368120	of oxygen per day or 785 pounds for the year, which will cost a mere $250 million dollars.
368120	371760	You may ask why we don't use an oxygen scrubber and the simple answer is that it would cost
371760	376080	quite a bit more to develop, build, and deliver a scrubber capable of creating enough clean
376080	377360	air for a crew of four.
377360	381580	It's just cheaper and less risky to bring all the necessary oxygen there.
381580	385040	In terms of power, it's been proposed that the best way to bring electricity to the moon
385040	387080	is to literally bring a nuclear reactor.
387080	391160	It'd be a little one, but it would carry out fission reactions on the surface of the
391160	392160	moon.
392160	396000	NASA has only proposed, not developed, this system, but they said it could be developed,
396000	400080	flight tested, and delivered to the moon for only $1.4 billion dollars.
400080	401800	Now we have everything we need.
401800	406120	So, to answer the question you came here for, how much would it cost to live a year on the
406120	407120	moon?
407120	411460	I'll just say before giving my answer that these were all estimates and far from perfect.
411460	415960	For example, it's likely that if NASA ever actually colonized the moon, it would be decades
415960	420320	in the future when commercial space companies are far more developed and the cost of transport
420320	421640	would be much less.
421640	425840	Space Flight Industries already sells cargo space to lunar orbit for a mere $10 million
425840	427720	dollars per 220 pounds.
427720	431800	With prices that low, it may not be long until living on the moon and other celestial bodies
431800	435160	becomes commercially advantageous through mining and tourism.
435160	439420	The very day this video goes up, Elon Musk is anticipated to announce SpaceX's plans
439420	445040	to get to Mars, including a massive rocket that'll be able to carry as many as 220,000
445040	450440	pounds to Mars for less than any previous rocket, which could make Martian colonization
450440	451800	economically feasible.
451800	457160	So, after adding everything up, my conservative estimate for one year with four astronauts
457160	460680	on the moon comes out to $36 billion dollars.
460680	470720	That's $98 million per day, $4.1 million per hour, $68,300 per minute, or $1,138 per
470720	475400	second—more than an average family makes in a year in Madagascar.
475400	476760	Is it worth it?
476760	477760	Maybe.
477760	481360	If we ever have to leave earth because of the environmental change that we've started,
481360	485400	that $36 billion dollars might be the best investment we've ever made.
485400	490880	After all, living on the moon or Mars or some other celestial body is a crucial first step
490880	494960	in learning how to survive when the earth is no longer.
