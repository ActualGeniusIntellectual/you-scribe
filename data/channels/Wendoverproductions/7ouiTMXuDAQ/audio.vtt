00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
Moon colonization is something that humans have dreamt about for centuries and it's

00:04.400 --> 00:07.400
entirely possible it's just a matter of cost.

00:07.400 --> 00:12.840
Bringing both humans and supplies the 234,000 miles to the lunar surface costs an enormous

00:12.840 --> 00:16.800
amount of money and it's difficult to justify the cost to taxpayers.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.400
So how much would it cost?

00:18.400 --> 00:19.860
Well that's a complicated question.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.440
For the sake of simplicity, let's say we're doing a one year return mission with four

00:23.440 --> 00:25.720
astronauts using NASA technology.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.560
The first thing we'll calculate is the cost of getting there and we'll need a rocket.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.960
The Saturn V is the only rocket to have ever existed that is powerful enough to take humans

00:33.960 --> 00:35.460
beyond low earth orbit.

00:35.460 --> 00:38.240
The problem is, all 15 of them are long retired.

00:38.240 --> 00:43.240
The Saturn V had a lunar payload capacity of 90,000 pounds and a per launch cost of

00:43.240 --> 00:51.540
$189,000,000 1971 dollars or $1,123,000,000 2016 dollars which works out to $12,500 per

00:51.540 --> 00:53.420
pound transported to the moon.

00:53.420 --> 00:57.900
That may seem like a lot, but that would mean that the average American, weighing 159 pounds,

00:57.900 --> 01:01.980
could travel to the moon on technology that existed when computers looked like this for

01:01.980 --> 01:04.020
a mere $2,000,000.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.860
I know you know that that's not right.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.300
There are two problems in that calculation.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.040
First off, that doesn't include research and development costs.

01:11.040 --> 01:17.780
A staggering $6.4 billion was spent to develop the Saturn V which is $38,000,000,000 in 2016

01:17.780 --> 01:18.780
dollars.

01:18.780 --> 01:23.860
So, considering that the Saturn V was launched 13 times, that works out to just over $4,000,000

01:23.860 --> 01:26.920
per launch or $44,000 per pound.

01:27.160 --> 01:31.040
To colonize the moon, you don't just need to get things to the moon, you need to get

01:31.040 --> 01:32.540
them on the moon.

01:32.540 --> 01:36.660
The budget allocated to develop and build 12 lunar landers back in the Apollo days was

01:36.660 --> 01:41.280
$18,000,000,000 2016 dollars or $1,500,000,000 per lander.

01:41.280 --> 01:45.440
Once again, the lunar landers are no longer in service so we're including the R&D costs

01:45.440 --> 01:46.800
in our calculations.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.760
We need two landers to bring our four astronauts to the moon and these have to be able to return

01:50.760 --> 01:53.800
so they need to land with both launch systems and fuel.

01:53.800 --> 01:58.380
So that's $1.5 billion per lander plus $4 billion per Saturn V launch so $11 billion

01:58.380 --> 02:01.220
total to carry our astronauts to the moon and back.

02:01.220 --> 02:05.440
During the Apollo days, NASA also developed a module called the LM truck which was designed

02:05.440 --> 02:08.600
to deliver payloads to the surface of the moon without a crew.

02:08.600 --> 02:13.520
Not only could these land with 11,000 pounds of cargo, but a Saturn V rocket could launch

02:13.520 --> 02:14.880
with two of them.

02:14.880 --> 02:19.160
Using the truck, we can bring our per pound cost of bringing cargo to the lunar surface

02:19.160 --> 02:22.040
down to a reasonable $318,000.

02:22.080 --> 02:24.080
Believe it or not, that's a bargain.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.920
So, once our four astronauts get to the moon, they need somewhere to live.

02:27.920 --> 02:32.320
The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC did a super detailed

02:32.320 --> 02:36.520
study on how much the development and construction of a lunar base would cost.

02:36.520 --> 02:41.600
For our four person base, it would cost $20 billion to develop plus one of our $4 billion

02:41.600 --> 02:43.360
launches equaling $24 billion.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.800
That's a little steep.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.360
For a budget option, we could go with something like Bigelow Airspace's B330 spacecraft.

02:49.360 --> 02:53.720
These are essentially inflatable buildings that work in space and with a bit of modification,

02:53.720 --> 02:56.560
they could conceivably be altered to work on the surface of the moon.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.720
Bigelow Airspace is a commercial company.

02:58.720 --> 03:04.360
They've said that the B330 would rent out for $1.25 million per day or $465 million

03:04.360 --> 03:05.840
for a one year mission.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.520
Considering that's the first time I've said million when talking about a current

03:08.520 --> 03:11.200
day cost, that's practically nothing.

03:11.200 --> 03:16.320
Until you consider the problem of getting the B330 to the moon, it weighs 43,000 pounds

03:16.320 --> 03:21.600
so it'd take four LM truck landings and two Saturn V launches for a total of $14 billion.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.440
Well, that's a little better than $24 billion.

03:24.440 --> 03:26.220
Let's move on to food.

03:26.220 --> 03:29.840
For food, the best, but not simplest solution is to just grow it.

03:29.840 --> 03:34.440
One lunar greenhouse developed by the University of Arizona could produce about 5.5 pounds

03:34.440 --> 03:35.660
of food per day.

03:35.660 --> 03:39.300
In order to have variety, NASA would probably choose a few different crops that would do

03:39.300 --> 03:40.720
well on the moon.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.040
For our calculations, we'll say that the greenhouse would be filled with 76% sweet

03:44.040 --> 03:47.400
potato, 16% tomato, and 10% strawberry.

03:47.400 --> 03:51.800
That'll come out to 4.3 pounds of sweet potato, .8 pounds of tomato, and .4 pounds

03:51.800 --> 03:53.380
of strawberries per day.

03:53.380 --> 03:59.660
Sweet potatoes have 389 calories per pound or 1,675 calories per day per greenhouse.

03:59.660 --> 04:04.400
The tomatoes and strawberries will make 65 and 60 calories per day per greenhouse respectively,

04:04.400 --> 04:07.520
so that's 1,800 calories per day per greenhouse total.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.720
Each of our four astronauts would need about 3,000 calories per day equaling 12,000 total

04:11.720 --> 04:15.640
per day, so we'll need 6.67 greenhouses total and since you can't really bring two

04:15.640 --> 04:19.600
thirds of a greenhouse, we'll bring 7 and have surplus food, which is great for backup.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.280
Each lunar greenhouse will require .2 pounds of fertilizer per day, which adds up to 1.4

04:24.280 --> 04:28.480
pounds of fertilizer per day for our 7 greenhouses and 510 pounds for the year.

04:28.480 --> 04:32.200
So, for the greenhouse's growing scheme, we'll need to physically bring the greenhouses

04:32.200 --> 04:38.480
which each weigh a full metric ton or 2,200 pounds which, for the 7 of them, is 15,400

04:38.480 --> 04:44.160
pounds or 4.9 billion dollars plus another 162 million dollars for fertilizer.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.880
The International Space Station is a really good example of how water resources could

04:47.880 --> 04:49.240
be managed on the moon.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.680
Every bit used on the ISS is recycled.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.360
That includes water from condensation, showers, sweat, and yes, urine.

04:56.360 --> 04:59.960
It of course gets filtered heavily, but the water in astronauts food is the same that

04:59.960 --> 05:03.080
came from, you know, other stuff.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.320
NASA says that, without water recycling, 40,000 pounds of water would be needed to sustain

05:08.320 --> 05:09.680
4 astronauts on the moon.

05:09.680 --> 05:13.040
That would cost $12.7 billion dollars to transport.

05:13.040 --> 05:18.040
With water recycling, we can bring that down to 5,110 pounds of water for the year.

05:18.040 --> 05:23.600
Except we have our greenhouse, quite a bit of water is needed to grow the plants—6,920

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
pounds worth to be specific.

05:24.600 --> 05:30.440
So that's 12,030 pounds of water for the year, which would cost $3.825 billion dollars

05:30.440 --> 05:31.440
to bring.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.920
So, next we need air, as in oxygen to breathe.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.320
A human at moderate activity levels needs 1.85 pounds of oxygen per day.

05:39.320 --> 05:44.740
So that means we'd need 7.4 pounds of oxygen per day for our four astronauts, 2,701 pounds

05:44.740 --> 05:47.640
for the year, which would cost $860 million dollars.

05:47.640 --> 05:52.700
But wait, because of our greenhouses and the amazing process of photosynthesis, we don't.

05:52.700 --> 05:56.220
One lunar greenhouse produces .75 pounds of oxygen per day.

05:56.220 --> 06:01.920
So our seven create 5.25 pounds of oxygen each day, so we only need to bring 2.15 pounds

06:01.920 --> 06:08.120
of oxygen per day or 785 pounds for the year, which will cost a mere $250 million dollars.

06:08.120 --> 06:11.760
You may ask why we don't use an oxygen scrubber and the simple answer is that it would cost

06:11.760 --> 06:16.080
quite a bit more to develop, build, and deliver a scrubber capable of creating enough clean

06:16.080 --> 06:17.360
air for a crew of four.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.580
It's just cheaper and less risky to bring all the necessary oxygen there.

06:21.580 --> 06:25.040
In terms of power, it's been proposed that the best way to bring electricity to the moon

06:25.040 --> 06:27.080
is to literally bring a nuclear reactor.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.160
It'd be a little one, but it would carry out fission reactions on the surface of the

06:31.160 --> 06:32.160
moon.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.000
NASA has only proposed, not developed, this system, but they said it could be developed,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.080
flight tested, and delivered to the moon for only $1.4 billion dollars.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.800
Now we have everything we need.

06:41.800 --> 06:46.120
So, to answer the question you came here for, how much would it cost to live a year on the

06:46.120 --> 06:47.120
moon?

06:47.120 --> 06:51.460
I'll just say before giving my answer that these were all estimates and far from perfect.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.960
For example, it's likely that if NASA ever actually colonized the moon, it would be decades

06:55.960 --> 07:00.320
in the future when commercial space companies are far more developed and the cost of transport

07:00.320 --> 07:01.640
would be much less.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.840
Space Flight Industries already sells cargo space to lunar orbit for a mere $10 million

07:05.840 --> 07:07.720
dollars per 220 pounds.

07:07.720 --> 07:11.800
With prices that low, it may not be long until living on the moon and other celestial bodies

07:11.800 --> 07:15.160
becomes commercially advantageous through mining and tourism.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.420
The very day this video goes up, Elon Musk is anticipated to announce SpaceX's plans

07:19.420 --> 07:25.040
to get to Mars, including a massive rocket that'll be able to carry as many as 220,000

07:25.040 --> 07:30.440
pounds to Mars for less than any previous rocket, which could make Martian colonization

07:30.440 --> 07:31.800
economically feasible.

07:31.800 --> 07:37.160
So, after adding everything up, my conservative estimate for one year with four astronauts

07:37.160 --> 07:40.680
on the moon comes out to $36 billion dollars.

07:40.680 --> 07:50.720
That's $98 million per day, $4.1 million per hour, $68,300 per minute, or $1,138 per

07:50.720 --> 07:55.400
second—more than an average family makes in a year in Madagascar.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.760
Is it worth it?

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
Maybe.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.360
If we ever have to leave earth because of the environmental change that we've started,

08:01.360 --> 08:05.400
that $36 billion dollars might be the best investment we've ever made.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.880
After all, living on the moon or Mars or some other celestial body is a crucial first step

08:10.880 --> 08:14.960
in learning how to survive when the earth is no longer.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.500
