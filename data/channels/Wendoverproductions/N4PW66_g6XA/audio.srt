fresh meals from Blue Apron.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,760
In 2004, the American Highway Users Alliance published an article claiming that the Katy

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,000
Freeway in Houston, Texas was the second most congested road in America.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,360
Drivers spent a combined 25.4 million hours every year sitting in traffic on that road.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,600
That's 36 lifetimes worth.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,240
It was an absolute embarrassment of a road for Texas, so they decided to spend $2.8 billion

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,880
to expand it to 28 lanes making it the widest highway in the world.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,180
All this extra capacity would surely fix the problem.

11
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,080
More lanes means more room for more cars which means shorter travel times, right?

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,620
Unfortunately not.

13
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:59,220
Between 2011 and 2014 alone, travel times on the Katy Freeway increased by up to 55%.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,900
It now takes an average of 64 minutes to drive the 28 miles between downtown Houston and

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,180
Katyland during the afternoon rush hour.

16
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,580
That's up from 41 minutes in 2011.

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,020
The problem with this project was that the solution violated the fundamental law of road

18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,600
congestion—more lanes mean more traffic.

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,820
This probably seems counterintuitive.

20
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,100
The more lanes there are the higher the capacity a road has so cars should be able to drive

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,780
faster, but that's a very narrow analysis of the problem.

22
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,680
You can't just think about how this would work on one road.

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,820
You have to think about it in the context of a whole city.

24
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,100
Many people choose not to drive places because of how long it takes.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,260
If the traffic is bad, they can take public transit or wait until a less busy time or

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,820
just not travel at all.

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,540
When a road is expanded, travel times initially decrease so all those people who chose not

28
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,220
to drive or to take an alternate route or whatever decide to switch to using that newly

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,540
expanded road.

30
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,740
What's fascinating about roads is that this happens at a perfect one to one ratio.

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,580
If the capacity of a road doubles, the amount of people using that road will also double.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,560
If it doubles again, the amount will again double.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,460
Of course, if you kept doing this over and over again you would eventually build a big

34
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,660
enough road that there wouldn't be any more cars to fill the road, but in the real world,

35
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,260
with a demand for roads far outstripped supply, drivers will adjust to any change in road

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,360
capacity.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
So does that mean it's hopeless?

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,180
Is there no way to solve traffic?

39
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,380
No way to make our roads better and safer and more efficient?

40
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,020
Well no, there's plenty we can do.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,140
Here's the thing about traffic—it slows down exponentially.

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,260
The 20,000th car on the road slows down traffic overall significantly more than the 5,000th

43
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,260
car.

44
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,340
As a major driver for a lot of jams, a small addition of cars leads to a large addition

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,580
in congestion, but it also makes solving traffic a bit easier since you only need to remove

46
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,340
a small amount of cars from the road and that's just what ramp meters do.

47
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,020
Ramp meters are set up on the on-ramps of highways to restrict the amount of people

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,440
getting on the highway.

49
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,560
They usually let one car on every five or six seconds.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,260
Since the amount of cars actually on the highway is kept down, the highway stays at its most

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,420
efficient speed.

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,220
Minnesota did an experiment where they shut down their long used ramp meters for eight

53
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,780
weeks in order to see if they actually worked and they found that the highway capacity decreased

54
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:29,460
by 9%, travel times increased by 22%, speeds dropped by 7%, and crashes increased by 26%.

55
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,740
Stockholm Sweden used that exponential nature of traffic to decrease travel times by up

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,560
to 40% in 2006.

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,660
Stockholm as a city lies across 14 islands which means that all the bridges act as huge

58
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
choke points.

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,600
Traffic, therefore, was historically horrible for this relatively small city.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,140
On January 3rd, 2006, Stockholm started to charge drivers who entered this central perimeter,

61
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,620
the busiest area.

62
00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,120
The charge wasn't much—between 10 and 20 krona, the equivalent of 1 and 2 US dollars—but

63
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,800
it was enough to persuade 20% of drivers to not enter the central perimeter.

64
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,440
They either went downtown on public transport, or walked, or didn't go at all.

65
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,220
These are the amounts of daily drivers in the perimeter in the years leading up to the

66
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
charge.

67
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,520
As soon as the charge was implemented in 2006, the daily amount dropped down to here.

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,900
It wasn't a fluke.

69
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,040
After the six month initial trial period, driving in the central core became free again

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,460
and the amount of daily drivers increased to nearly the level it was before.

71
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,860
When the charge became permanent in 2007, daily numbers once again plummeted.

72
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,400
Even though the charge was miniscule, it was enough to dissuade tens of thousands of people

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,280
from using those roads.

74
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,680
There are really two costs of driving—the money and the time.

75
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,140
When the time it takes to drive isn't enough of a cost to prevent people from driving,

76
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,580
these charges increase the overall cost to a level where some people will decide not

77
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
to drive.

78
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,700
But what about safety?

79
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,240
Roads are still unbelievably dangerous.

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,860
In any given year, one out of every 10,000 people in the US die in a car accident.

81
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,960
Just think about how high of a proportion that is.

82
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,980
If you go to a Redskins game at FedEx Field near Washington DC, eight of the people sitting

83
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,420
in the stands with you will die in the next year in a car accident.

84
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,660
It turns out one of the best ways to prevent accidents is with something you've almost

85
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,700
certainly already seen or used—the roundabout.

86
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,900
There's a reason you see these more and more.

87
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,320
Roundabouts reduce deaths and serious injuries by 90%.

88
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,840
That is not an error.

89
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,800
With roundabouts, there's almost no opportunity for the worst type of collision—the head-on,

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,080
full-speed crash.

91
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,280
In a traditional intersection, cars come within feet of each other while going at a relative

92
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,200
speed of up to 100 miles per hour.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,520
A head-on crash at that speed is undoubtedly catastrophic.

94
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,680
With roundabouts, cars naturally slow down to about 15 to 25 miles per hour since they're

95
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,120
going around a curve.

96
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,420
Also, if there were to be a collision, it would either be a side-impact collision if

97
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,260
a car failed to turn into the circle or a side-to-side collision if a car misjudged

98
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,260
the curve.

99
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,340
Both of these collisions happen at a low relative speed so fatalities are low.

100
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,180
But what about capacity?

101
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,860
Surely the lower speed roundabouts cause horrible traffic problems.

102
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,700
Well, they don't.

103
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,820
A single lane roundabout can handle a maximum of 1,800 vehicles per hour which is exactly

104
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,320
the same as a traditional two-lane signaled intersection.

105
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:32,640
While cars will move through a signaled intersection at a much higher speed, they have to wait

106
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,040
both for the light to change and left-turning cars.

107
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,640
With roundabouts, you have a smooth, consistent, albeit slower flow.

108
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,840
So what's the problem?

109
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,000
Why haven't we replaced every intersection with a roundabout?

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,320
Well there are disadvantages.

111
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,440
They're more difficult for pedestrians, especially those who are deaf or blind, they

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,740
require a larger footprint, they're more expensive to maintain, but the real reason

113
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,300
roundabouts are not ubiquitous nowadays is because of the biggest fallacy in road design—that

114
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,700
drivers need rules.

115
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:07,620
Poynton, just outside of Manchester, UK, used to have a typical, rather dreary intersection

116
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,860
and nobody really liked it.

117
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,460
Cars would back up for miles, pedestrians had to wait forever for the light to change

118
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,940
and it essentially split the town apart.

119
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,420
So someone had the idea to remove the traffic lights, remove the zebra crossings, the curbs,

120
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,240
remove almost every safety device in the intersection, and just set up two adjoining

121
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
roundabouts.

122
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,960
Surely this would wreak havoc, but it didn't.

123
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,740
Turns out, when people are uncomfortable, when people aren't really sure what's

124
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,000
going on, they pay more attention.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,400
The green light was a signal to people that the road was clear, that it was safe to speed,

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,200
that they could let their guard down, but after the change the cars were able to flow

127
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,160
freely, albeit at a slow pace, instead of waiting for the lights to change.

128
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,400
Construction incidents went down, collisions went down, traffic flowed faster, and the

129
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,700
city center finally had some character.

130
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,500
So, all around the world, cities are replicating what Poynton did.

131
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,540
They're removing curbs, traffic lights, and pedestrian crossings to make one shared

132
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
space.

133
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,900
All around the world, these streets are resulting in fewer accidents and more pedestrian space.

134
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,060
Discomfort is saving lives.

135
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,260
On a larger scale, there's one more innovative intersection design that's beginning to

136
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,000
save lives—the diverging diamond interchange.

137
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,700
This interchange is designed as a way to get more cars on and off the highways faster.

138
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,160
After the on-ramp to the right side, the road crosses over so cars never have to traverse

139
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,400
active lanes to get onto the highway.

140
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,600
A car heading north can effortlessly join the on-ramp without crossing traffic, and

141
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:40,220
a car heading south will cross over so it drives on the left side and can effortlessly

142
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,600
join the on-ramp to head south.

143
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,280
Not only is this easier for drivers, it improves safety.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,680
The dangerousness of an intersection is often rated by determining the number of conflict

145
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,500
points—possible points where accidents could happen under normal circumstances.

146
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,860
With a traditional on-ramp intersection there are 26, with a diverging diamond intersection

147
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,180
only 14, and they're faster too.

148
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,820
The US Department of Transportation found in a study that universally, whether the traffic

149
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,400
was light or heavy, diverging diamond interchanges let more cars through faster.

150
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
It costs less too.

151
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,100
A traditional on-ramp intersection requires $11.3 million to build.

152
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,000
A diverging diamond intersection, only $5.7 million.

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,340
There are really no major disadvantages to this intersection so nearly 100 of them have

154
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,660
been built to date and more and more are being installed each month.

155
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,240
As good as these solutions sound, there's no one way to solve traffic.

156
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,480
The difference between cities with chronic traffic problems and those without is a combination

157
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,240
of smart policies and designs that mitigate the effects of having more road demand than

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,100
supply, but traffic won't just fix itself.

159
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:59,320
So until cities at least experiment with solutions, we're all condemned to traffic forever.

160
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,680
Fixing traffic is all about saving time and improving the environment and so is Blue Apron.

161
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,900
They ship pre-apportioned meals straight to your doorstep sourced directly from sustainable

162
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,580
farms and fisheries.

163
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,180
Blue Apron sent me a box to try out and it was a fantastic meal.

164
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,020
You're shipped the exact amount of everything you need so you don't have to do any measuring.

165
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,260
Not only does this save time, it also minimizes food waste.

166
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,740
They give you these clear, concise instructions so even the least experienced chefs can work

167
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,180
with their recipes.

168
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,460
So here's the meal I made.

169
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,140
It was healthy, quick, filling, and delicious and the good news is that you can get a meal

170
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
just like this for free.

171
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,560
