00:08.520 --> 00:11.160
fresh meals from Blue Apron.

00:11.160 --> 00:15.760
In 2004, the American Highway Users Alliance published an article claiming that the Katy

00:15.760 --> 00:21.000
Freeway in Houston, Texas was the second most congested road in America.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.360
Drivers spent a combined 25.4 million hours every year sitting in traffic on that road.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.600
That's 36 lifetimes worth.

00:30.600 --> 00:37.240
It was an absolute embarrassment of a road for Texas, so they decided to spend $2.8 billion

00:37.240 --> 00:41.880
to expand it to 28 lanes making it the widest highway in the world.

00:41.880 --> 00:45.180
All this extra capacity would surely fix the problem.

00:45.180 --> 00:50.080
More lanes means more room for more cars which means shorter travel times, right?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.620
Unfortunately not.

00:51.620 --> 00:59.220
Between 2011 and 2014 alone, travel times on the Katy Freeway increased by up to 55%.

00:59.220 --> 01:04.900
It now takes an average of 64 minutes to drive the 28 miles between downtown Houston and

01:04.900 --> 01:07.180
Katyland during the afternoon rush hour.

01:07.180 --> 01:10.580
That's up from 41 minutes in 2011.

01:10.580 --> 01:15.020
The problem with this project was that the solution violated the fundamental law of road

01:15.020 --> 01:18.600
congestion—more lanes mean more traffic.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.820
This probably seems counterintuitive.

01:20.820 --> 01:25.100
The more lanes there are the higher the capacity a road has so cars should be able to drive

01:25.100 --> 01:28.780
faster, but that's a very narrow analysis of the problem.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.680
You can't just think about how this would work on one road.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.820
You have to think about it in the context of a whole city.

01:34.820 --> 01:38.100
Many people choose not to drive places because of how long it takes.

01:38.100 --> 01:42.260
If the traffic is bad, they can take public transit or wait until a less busy time or

01:42.260 --> 01:43.820
just not travel at all.

01:43.820 --> 01:48.540
When a road is expanded, travel times initially decrease so all those people who chose not

01:48.540 --> 01:53.220
to drive or to take an alternate route or whatever decide to switch to using that newly

01:53.220 --> 01:54.540
expanded road.

01:54.540 --> 01:59.740
What's fascinating about roads is that this happens at a perfect one to one ratio.

01:59.740 --> 02:04.580
If the capacity of a road doubles, the amount of people using that road will also double.

02:04.580 --> 02:07.560
If it doubles again, the amount will again double.

02:07.560 --> 02:10.460
Of course, if you kept doing this over and over again you would eventually build a big

02:10.460 --> 02:14.660
enough road that there wouldn't be any more cars to fill the road, but in the real world,

02:14.660 --> 02:20.260
with a demand for roads far outstripped supply, drivers will adjust to any change in road

02:20.260 --> 02:21.360
capacity.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.040
So does that mean it's hopeless?

02:23.040 --> 02:25.180
Is there no way to solve traffic?

02:25.180 --> 02:28.380
No way to make our roads better and safer and more efficient?

02:28.380 --> 02:31.020
Well no, there's plenty we can do.

02:31.020 --> 02:35.140
Here's the thing about traffic—it slows down exponentially.

02:35.140 --> 02:41.260
The 20,000th car on the road slows down traffic overall significantly more than the 5,000th

02:41.260 --> 02:42.260
car.

02:42.260 --> 02:47.340
As a major driver for a lot of jams, a small addition of cars leads to a large addition

02:47.340 --> 02:52.580
in congestion, but it also makes solving traffic a bit easier since you only need to remove

02:52.580 --> 02:57.340
a small amount of cars from the road and that's just what ramp meters do.

02:57.340 --> 03:01.020
Ramp meters are set up on the on-ramps of highways to restrict the amount of people

03:01.020 --> 03:02.440
getting on the highway.

03:02.440 --> 03:06.560
They usually let one car on every five or six seconds.

03:06.560 --> 03:11.260
Since the amount of cars actually on the highway is kept down, the highway stays at its most

03:11.260 --> 03:12.420
efficient speed.

03:12.420 --> 03:16.220
Minnesota did an experiment where they shut down their long used ramp meters for eight

03:16.220 --> 03:20.780
weeks in order to see if they actually worked and they found that the highway capacity decreased

03:20.780 --> 03:29.460
by 9%, travel times increased by 22%, speeds dropped by 7%, and crashes increased by 26%.

03:29.460 --> 03:33.740
Stockholm Sweden used that exponential nature of traffic to decrease travel times by up

03:33.740 --> 03:36.560
to 40% in 2006.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.660
Stockholm as a city lies across 14 islands which means that all the bridges act as huge

03:41.660 --> 03:42.660
choke points.

03:42.660 --> 03:47.600
Traffic, therefore, was historically horrible for this relatively small city.

03:47.600 --> 03:53.140
On January 3rd, 2006, Stockholm started to charge drivers who entered this central perimeter,

03:53.140 --> 03:54.620
the busiest area.

03:54.620 --> 04:00.120
The charge wasn't much—between 10 and 20 krona, the equivalent of 1 and 2 US dollars—but

04:00.120 --> 04:04.800
it was enough to persuade 20% of drivers to not enter the central perimeter.

04:04.800 --> 04:09.440
They either went downtown on public transport, or walked, or didn't go at all.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.220
These are the amounts of daily drivers in the perimeter in the years leading up to the

04:13.220 --> 04:14.220
charge.

04:14.220 --> 04:19.520
As soon as the charge was implemented in 2006, the daily amount dropped down to here.

04:19.520 --> 04:20.900
It wasn't a fluke.

04:20.900 --> 04:25.040
After the six month initial trial period, driving in the central core became free again

04:25.040 --> 04:29.460
and the amount of daily drivers increased to nearly the level it was before.

04:29.460 --> 04:34.860
When the charge became permanent in 2007, daily numbers once again plummeted.

04:34.860 --> 04:39.400
Even though the charge was miniscule, it was enough to dissuade tens of thousands of people

04:39.400 --> 04:41.280
from using those roads.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.680
There are really two costs of driving—the money and the time.

04:44.680 --> 04:49.140
When the time it takes to drive isn't enough of a cost to prevent people from driving,

04:49.140 --> 04:53.580
these charges increase the overall cost to a level where some people will decide not

04:53.580 --> 04:54.580
to drive.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.700
But what about safety?

04:56.700 --> 04:59.240
Roads are still unbelievably dangerous.

04:59.240 --> 05:04.860
In any given year, one out of every 10,000 people in the US die in a car accident.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.960
Just think about how high of a proportion that is.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.980
If you go to a Redskins game at FedEx Field near Washington DC, eight of the people sitting

05:12.980 --> 05:17.420
in the stands with you will die in the next year in a car accident.

05:17.420 --> 05:21.660
It turns out one of the best ways to prevent accidents is with something you've almost

05:21.660 --> 05:24.700
certainly already seen or used—the roundabout.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.900
There's a reason you see these more and more.

05:27.940 --> 05:31.320
Roundabouts reduce deaths and serious injuries by 90%.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.840
That is not an error.

05:32.840 --> 05:37.800
With roundabouts, there's almost no opportunity for the worst type of collision—the head-on,

05:37.800 --> 05:39.080
full-speed crash.

05:39.080 --> 05:43.280
In a traditional intersection, cars come within feet of each other while going at a relative

05:43.280 --> 05:46.200
speed of up to 100 miles per hour.

05:46.200 --> 05:50.520
A head-on crash at that speed is undoubtedly catastrophic.

05:50.520 --> 05:55.680
With roundabouts, cars naturally slow down to about 15 to 25 miles per hour since they're

05:55.680 --> 05:57.120
going around a curve.

05:57.140 --> 06:01.420
Also, if there were to be a collision, it would either be a side-impact collision if

06:01.420 --> 06:06.260
a car failed to turn into the circle or a side-to-side collision if a car misjudged

06:06.260 --> 06:07.260
the curve.

06:07.260 --> 06:12.340
Both of these collisions happen at a low relative speed so fatalities are low.

06:12.340 --> 06:14.180
But what about capacity?

06:14.180 --> 06:17.860
Surely the lower speed roundabouts cause horrible traffic problems.

06:17.860 --> 06:19.700
Well, they don't.

06:19.700 --> 06:24.820
A single lane roundabout can handle a maximum of 1,800 vehicles per hour which is exactly

06:24.820 --> 06:28.320
the same as a traditional two-lane signaled intersection.

06:28.320 --> 06:32.640
While cars will move through a signaled intersection at a much higher speed, they have to wait

06:32.640 --> 06:36.040
both for the light to change and left-turning cars.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.640
With roundabouts, you have a smooth, consistent, albeit slower flow.

06:40.640 --> 06:41.840
So what's the problem?

06:41.840 --> 06:45.000
Why haven't we replaced every intersection with a roundabout?

06:45.000 --> 06:46.320
Well there are disadvantages.

06:46.320 --> 06:50.440
They're more difficult for pedestrians, especially those who are deaf or blind, they

06:50.440 --> 06:54.740
require a larger footprint, they're more expensive to maintain, but the real reason

06:54.740 --> 07:00.300
roundabouts are not ubiquitous nowadays is because of the biggest fallacy in road design—that

07:00.300 --> 07:01.700
drivers need rules.

07:01.700 --> 07:07.620
Poynton, just outside of Manchester, UK, used to have a typical, rather dreary intersection

07:07.620 --> 07:09.860
and nobody really liked it.

07:09.860 --> 07:13.460
Cars would back up for miles, pedestrians had to wait forever for the light to change

07:13.460 --> 07:15.940
and it essentially split the town apart.

07:15.940 --> 07:20.420
So someone had the idea to remove the traffic lights, remove the zebra crossings, the curbs,

07:20.420 --> 07:25.240
remove almost every safety device in the intersection, and just set up two adjoining

07:25.240 --> 07:26.240
roundabouts.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.960
Surely this would wreak havoc, but it didn't.

07:28.960 --> 07:32.740
Turns out, when people are uncomfortable, when people aren't really sure what's

07:32.740 --> 07:35.000
going on, they pay more attention.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.400
The green light was a signal to people that the road was clear, that it was safe to speed,

07:39.400 --> 07:43.200
that they could let their guard down, but after the change the cars were able to flow

07:43.200 --> 07:48.160
freely, albeit at a slow pace, instead of waiting for the lights to change.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.400
Construction incidents went down, collisions went down, traffic flowed faster, and the

07:52.400 --> 07:54.700
city center finally had some character.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.500
So, all around the world, cities are replicating what Poynton did.

07:58.500 --> 08:03.540
They're removing curbs, traffic lights, and pedestrian crossings to make one shared

08:03.540 --> 08:04.540
space.

08:04.540 --> 08:09.900
All around the world, these streets are resulting in fewer accidents and more pedestrian space.

08:09.900 --> 08:12.060
Discomfort is saving lives.

08:12.060 --> 08:16.260
On a larger scale, there's one more innovative intersection design that's beginning to

08:16.260 --> 08:20.000
save lives—the diverging diamond interchange.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.700
This interchange is designed as a way to get more cars on and off the highways faster.

08:24.700 --> 08:29.160
After the on-ramp to the right side, the road crosses over so cars never have to traverse

08:29.160 --> 08:31.400
active lanes to get onto the highway.

08:31.400 --> 08:35.600
A car heading north can effortlessly join the on-ramp without crossing traffic, and

08:35.600 --> 08:40.220
a car heading south will cross over so it drives on the left side and can effortlessly

08:40.220 --> 08:42.600
join the on-ramp to head south.

08:42.600 --> 08:46.280
Not only is this easier for drivers, it improves safety.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.680
The dangerousness of an intersection is often rated by determining the number of conflict

08:50.680 --> 08:55.500
points—possible points where accidents could happen under normal circumstances.

08:55.500 --> 09:00.860
With a traditional on-ramp intersection there are 26, with a diverging diamond intersection

09:00.860 --> 09:04.180
only 14, and they're faster too.

09:04.180 --> 09:08.820
The US Department of Transportation found in a study that universally, whether the traffic

09:08.820 --> 09:14.400
was light or heavy, diverging diamond interchanges let more cars through faster.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.840
It costs less too.

09:15.840 --> 09:21.100
A traditional on-ramp intersection requires $11.3 million to build.

09:21.100 --> 09:26.000
A diverging diamond intersection, only $5.7 million.

09:26.000 --> 09:31.340
There are really no major disadvantages to this intersection so nearly 100 of them have

09:31.340 --> 09:35.660
been built to date and more and more are being installed each month.

09:35.660 --> 09:40.240
As good as these solutions sound, there's no one way to solve traffic.

09:40.240 --> 09:44.480
The difference between cities with chronic traffic problems and those without is a combination

09:44.480 --> 09:49.240
of smart policies and designs that mitigate the effects of having more road demand than

09:49.240 --> 09:52.100
supply, but traffic won't just fix itself.

09:52.100 --> 09:59.320
So until cities at least experiment with solutions, we're all condemned to traffic forever.

09:59.320 --> 10:04.680
Fixing traffic is all about saving time and improving the environment and so is Blue Apron.

10:04.700 --> 10:08.900
They ship pre-apportioned meals straight to your doorstep sourced directly from sustainable

10:08.900 --> 10:10.580
farms and fisheries.

10:10.580 --> 10:14.180
Blue Apron sent me a box to try out and it was a fantastic meal.

10:14.180 --> 10:19.020
You're shipped the exact amount of everything you need so you don't have to do any measuring.

10:19.020 --> 10:22.260
Not only does this save time, it also minimizes food waste.

10:22.260 --> 10:26.740
They give you these clear, concise instructions so even the least experienced chefs can work

10:26.740 --> 10:28.180
with their recipes.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.460
So here's the meal I made.

10:29.460 --> 10:34.140
It was healthy, quick, filling, and delicious and the good news is that you can get a meal

10:34.160 --> 10:36.400
