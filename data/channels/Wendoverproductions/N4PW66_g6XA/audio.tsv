11160	15760	In 2004, the American Highway Users Alliance published an article claiming that the Katy
15760	21000	Freeway in Houston, Texas was the second most congested road in America.
21000	28360	Drivers spent a combined 25.4 million hours every year sitting in traffic on that road.
28360	30600	That's 36 lifetimes worth.
30600	37240	It was an absolute embarrassment of a road for Texas, so they decided to spend $2.8 billion
37240	41880	to expand it to 28 lanes making it the widest highway in the world.
41880	45180	All this extra capacity would surely fix the problem.
45180	50080	More lanes means more room for more cars which means shorter travel times, right?
50080	51620	Unfortunately not.
51620	59220	Between 2011 and 2014 alone, travel times on the Katy Freeway increased by up to 55%.
59220	64900	It now takes an average of 64 minutes to drive the 28 miles between downtown Houston and
64900	67180	Katyland during the afternoon rush hour.
67180	70580	That's up from 41 minutes in 2011.
70580	75020	The problem with this project was that the solution violated the fundamental law of road
75020	78600	congestion—more lanes mean more traffic.
78600	80820	This probably seems counterintuitive.
80820	85100	The more lanes there are the higher the capacity a road has so cars should be able to drive
85100	88780	faster, but that's a very narrow analysis of the problem.
88780	91680	You can't just think about how this would work on one road.
91680	94820	You have to think about it in the context of a whole city.
94820	98100	Many people choose not to drive places because of how long it takes.
98100	102260	If the traffic is bad, they can take public transit or wait until a less busy time or
102260	103820	just not travel at all.
103820	108540	When a road is expanded, travel times initially decrease so all those people who chose not
108540	113220	to drive or to take an alternate route or whatever decide to switch to using that newly
113220	114540	expanded road.
114540	119740	What's fascinating about roads is that this happens at a perfect one to one ratio.
119740	124580	If the capacity of a road doubles, the amount of people using that road will also double.
124580	127560	If it doubles again, the amount will again double.
127560	130460	Of course, if you kept doing this over and over again you would eventually build a big
130460	134660	enough road that there wouldn't be any more cars to fill the road, but in the real world,
134660	140260	with a demand for roads far outstripped supply, drivers will adjust to any change in road
140260	141360	capacity.
141360	143040	So does that mean it's hopeless?
143040	145180	Is there no way to solve traffic?
145180	148380	No way to make our roads better and safer and more efficient?
148380	151020	Well no, there's plenty we can do.
151020	155140	Here's the thing about traffic—it slows down exponentially.
155140	161260	The 20,000th car on the road slows down traffic overall significantly more than the 5,000th
161260	162260	car.
162260	167340	As a major driver for a lot of jams, a small addition of cars leads to a large addition
167340	172580	in congestion, but it also makes solving traffic a bit easier since you only need to remove
172580	177340	a small amount of cars from the road and that's just what ramp meters do.
177340	181020	Ramp meters are set up on the on-ramps of highways to restrict the amount of people
181020	182440	getting on the highway.
182440	186560	They usually let one car on every five or six seconds.
186560	191260	Since the amount of cars actually on the highway is kept down, the highway stays at its most
191260	192420	efficient speed.
192420	196220	Minnesota did an experiment where they shut down their long used ramp meters for eight
196220	200780	weeks in order to see if they actually worked and they found that the highway capacity decreased
200780	209460	by 9%, travel times increased by 22%, speeds dropped by 7%, and crashes increased by 26%.
209460	213740	Stockholm Sweden used that exponential nature of traffic to decrease travel times by up
213740	216560	to 40% in 2006.
216560	221660	Stockholm as a city lies across 14 islands which means that all the bridges act as huge
221660	222660	choke points.
222660	227600	Traffic, therefore, was historically horrible for this relatively small city.
227600	233140	On January 3rd, 2006, Stockholm started to charge drivers who entered this central perimeter,
233140	234620	the busiest area.
234620	240120	The charge wasn't much—between 10 and 20 krona, the equivalent of 1 and 2 US dollars—but
240120	244800	it was enough to persuade 20% of drivers to not enter the central perimeter.
244800	249440	They either went downtown on public transport, or walked, or didn't go at all.
249440	253220	These are the amounts of daily drivers in the perimeter in the years leading up to the
253220	254220	charge.
254220	259520	As soon as the charge was implemented in 2006, the daily amount dropped down to here.
259520	260900	It wasn't a fluke.
260900	265040	After the six month initial trial period, driving in the central core became free again
265040	269460	and the amount of daily drivers increased to nearly the level it was before.
269460	274860	When the charge became permanent in 2007, daily numbers once again plummeted.
274860	279400	Even though the charge was miniscule, it was enough to dissuade tens of thousands of people
279400	281280	from using those roads.
281280	284680	There are really two costs of driving—the money and the time.
284680	289140	When the time it takes to drive isn't enough of a cost to prevent people from driving,
289140	293580	these charges increase the overall cost to a level where some people will decide not
293580	294580	to drive.
294580	296700	But what about safety?
296700	299240	Roads are still unbelievably dangerous.
299240	304860	In any given year, one out of every 10,000 people in the US die in a car accident.
304860	307960	Just think about how high of a proportion that is.
307960	312980	If you go to a Redskins game at FedEx Field near Washington DC, eight of the people sitting
312980	317420	in the stands with you will die in the next year in a car accident.
317420	321660	It turns out one of the best ways to prevent accidents is with something you've almost
321660	324700	certainly already seen or used—the roundabout.
324700	327900	There's a reason you see these more and more.
327940	331320	Roundabouts reduce deaths and serious injuries by 90%.
331320	332840	That is not an error.
332840	337800	With roundabouts, there's almost no opportunity for the worst type of collision—the head-on,
337800	339080	full-speed crash.
339080	343280	In a traditional intersection, cars come within feet of each other while going at a relative
343280	346200	speed of up to 100 miles per hour.
346200	350520	A head-on crash at that speed is undoubtedly catastrophic.
350520	355680	With roundabouts, cars naturally slow down to about 15 to 25 miles per hour since they're
355680	357120	going around a curve.
357140	361420	Also, if there were to be a collision, it would either be a side-impact collision if
361420	366260	a car failed to turn into the circle or a side-to-side collision if a car misjudged
366260	367260	the curve.
367260	372340	Both of these collisions happen at a low relative speed so fatalities are low.
372340	374180	But what about capacity?
374180	377860	Surely the lower speed roundabouts cause horrible traffic problems.
377860	379700	Well, they don't.
379700	384820	A single lane roundabout can handle a maximum of 1,800 vehicles per hour which is exactly
384820	388320	the same as a traditional two-lane signaled intersection.
388320	392640	While cars will move through a signaled intersection at a much higher speed, they have to wait
392640	396040	both for the light to change and left-turning cars.
396040	400640	With roundabouts, you have a smooth, consistent, albeit slower flow.
400640	401840	So what's the problem?
401840	405000	Why haven't we replaced every intersection with a roundabout?
405000	406320	Well there are disadvantages.
406320	410440	They're more difficult for pedestrians, especially those who are deaf or blind, they
410440	414740	require a larger footprint, they're more expensive to maintain, but the real reason
414740	420300	roundabouts are not ubiquitous nowadays is because of the biggest fallacy in road design—that
420300	421700	drivers need rules.
421700	427620	Poynton, just outside of Manchester, UK, used to have a typical, rather dreary intersection
427620	429860	and nobody really liked it.
429860	433460	Cars would back up for miles, pedestrians had to wait forever for the light to change
433460	435940	and it essentially split the town apart.
435940	440420	So someone had the idea to remove the traffic lights, remove the zebra crossings, the curbs,
440420	445240	remove almost every safety device in the intersection, and just set up two adjoining
445240	446240	roundabouts.
446240	448960	Surely this would wreak havoc, but it didn't.
448960	452740	Turns out, when people are uncomfortable, when people aren't really sure what's
452740	455000	going on, they pay more attention.
455000	459400	The green light was a signal to people that the road was clear, that it was safe to speed,
459400	463200	that they could let their guard down, but after the change the cars were able to flow
463200	468160	freely, albeit at a slow pace, instead of waiting for the lights to change.
468160	472400	Construction incidents went down, collisions went down, traffic flowed faster, and the
472400	474700	city center finally had some character.
474700	478500	So, all around the world, cities are replicating what Poynton did.
478500	483540	They're removing curbs, traffic lights, and pedestrian crossings to make one shared
483540	484540	space.
484540	489900	All around the world, these streets are resulting in fewer accidents and more pedestrian space.
489900	492060	Discomfort is saving lives.
492060	496260	On a larger scale, there's one more innovative intersection design that's beginning to
496260	500000	save lives—the diverging diamond interchange.
500000	504700	This interchange is designed as a way to get more cars on and off the highways faster.
504700	509160	After the on-ramp to the right side, the road crosses over so cars never have to traverse
509160	511400	active lanes to get onto the highway.
511400	515600	A car heading north can effortlessly join the on-ramp without crossing traffic, and
515600	520220	a car heading south will cross over so it drives on the left side and can effortlessly
520220	522600	join the on-ramp to head south.
522600	526280	Not only is this easier for drivers, it improves safety.
526280	530680	The dangerousness of an intersection is often rated by determining the number of conflict
530680	535500	points—possible points where accidents could happen under normal circumstances.
535500	540860	With a traditional on-ramp intersection there are 26, with a diverging diamond intersection
540860	544180	only 14, and they're faster too.
544180	548820	The US Department of Transportation found in a study that universally, whether the traffic
548820	554400	was light or heavy, diverging diamond interchanges let more cars through faster.
554400	555840	It costs less too.
555840	561100	A traditional on-ramp intersection requires $11.3 million to build.
561100	566000	A diverging diamond intersection, only $5.7 million.
566000	571340	There are really no major disadvantages to this intersection so nearly 100 of them have
571340	575660	been built to date and more and more are being installed each month.
575660	580240	As good as these solutions sound, there's no one way to solve traffic.
580240	584480	The difference between cities with chronic traffic problems and those without is a combination
584480	589240	of smart policies and designs that mitigate the effects of having more road demand than
589240	592100	supply, but traffic won't just fix itself.
592100	599320	So until cities at least experiment with solutions, we're all condemned to traffic forever.
