00:10.540 --> 00:16.440
The term, helicopter airline, is one that most are probably not familiar with.

00:16.440 --> 00:22.100
Simply, it's an airline, transporting passengers or cargo, that uses helicopters.

00:22.100 --> 00:27.900
Of course, not all helicopter companies are truly airlines, since many, if not most civilian

00:27.900 --> 00:31.600
applications of helicopters do not involve transport.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.200
The people or things inside often land right back where they took off.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.980
Helicopter airlines have been around almost as long as helicopters themselves, but they

00:39.980 --> 00:42.620
certainly are not widespread.

00:42.620 --> 00:47.400
There was, however, a time when helicopters were believed to be the future of short-haul

00:47.400 --> 00:49.140
passenger transport.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.060
So what happened?

00:51.060 --> 00:55.940
The opportunity for helicopter airlines emerged around the 1950s.

00:55.940 --> 01:00.340
When passenger aviation first began, cities' first airports were located rather close to

01:00.340 --> 01:04.540
the cities themselves as they just didn't need as much space.

01:04.540 --> 01:09.340
Around the mid-century, New York's primary airport was LaGuardia, Chicago's was Midway,

01:09.340 --> 01:14.800
DC's was National, Paris's was Le Bourget, and Tokyo's was Hanedaâ€”all airports fairly

01:14.800 --> 01:16.800
close to their city centers.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.620
These airports were relatively small and generally had short runways, but that wasn't a problem

01:21.620 --> 01:25.460
because passenger demand was small and airplanes were too.

01:25.460 --> 01:30.140
After all, the smaller the airplane, the shorter the runway needed, and vice versa.

01:30.140 --> 01:34.740
These small airports even worked for the long-haul flights of the time since, in general, before

01:34.740 --> 01:39.740
the 1950s, these were done on relatively small airplanes that would make multiple stops on

01:39.740 --> 01:41.140
longer journeys.

01:41.140 --> 01:45.720
However, with the introduction of the de Havilland Comet in the 1950s and other passenger jet

01:45.720 --> 01:50.620
aircraft soon after, airplanes were growing larger, range was increasing, and passenger

01:50.620 --> 01:52.700
demand rose too.

01:52.700 --> 01:57.280
That meant that all these small airports of the past wouldn't cut it, and so, cities

01:57.280 --> 02:01.580
looked to build larger airports more suited for the jet age.

02:01.580 --> 02:06.260
New York's primary airport shifted from LaGuardia to JFK, Chicago's to O'Hare,

02:06.260 --> 02:10.620
DC's to Dulles, Paris's to Orly, and Tokyo's to Narita.

02:10.620 --> 02:14.740
Each of these larger airports were further from their city centers, though, as that was

02:14.740 --> 02:16.580
where there was space.

02:16.580 --> 02:21.580
In many cases, the smaller, closer airports remained in operation for domestic or regional

02:21.580 --> 02:24.580
flights, but in other cases, they closed down.

02:24.580 --> 02:29.620
That's how we got to the reality today where many cities airports are an hour's trip

02:29.620 --> 02:31.320
from the city center.

02:31.320 --> 02:36.280
Of course, the impact of this distancing varied depending on the type of flights passengers

02:36.280 --> 02:37.380
were taking.

02:37.380 --> 02:41.820
For example, with a seven-hour flight from New York to London, the additional 45 or so

02:41.820 --> 02:46.440
minutes it would take to get from Manhattan to JFK over LaGuardia only extends overall

02:46.440 --> 02:48.740
travel time by about 7.5%.

02:48.740 --> 02:54.140
However, on the one-hour flight from New York to DC, this would extend travel time by nearly

02:54.140 --> 02:55.760
20%.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.200
This trend of distancing of airports from their cities had little impact on long-haul

03:00.200 --> 03:04.700
flights, but it had a huge effect on short-haul flights, meaning that planes were now less

03:04.700 --> 03:07.820
competitive compared to cars or trains.

03:07.820 --> 03:13.100
Nowadays, via JFK, it takes just 30 minutes more to travel from Manhattan to downtown

03:13.100 --> 03:17.860
Charlotte than from Manhattan to downtown DC, even though Charlotte is more than twice

03:17.860 --> 03:18.860
as far.

03:18.860 --> 03:24.140
There are always diminishing marginal returns to air travel's efficiency as distance decreases,

03:24.140 --> 03:29.040
but moving airports further from cities increases this to the point that, below a couple hundred

03:29.040 --> 03:34.800
miles of distance, airplanes are not the fastest means of travel.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.400
Helicopter airlines were supposed to solve that.

03:37.400 --> 03:43.540
It was quite the niche business model concept, but the 1950s, 60s, and 70s saw a small wave

03:43.540 --> 03:48.380
of these, particularly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.

03:48.380 --> 03:54.300
SFO Airlines, for example, operated an extensive network around the Bay Area serving San Jose,

03:54.300 --> 03:59.700
Palo Alto, San Francisco Airport, Oakland Airport, downtown Oakland, downtown San Francisco,

03:59.700 --> 04:02.020
Marin City, Berkeley, and Concord.

04:02.020 --> 04:05.020
SFO Airlines' fares were quite reasonable.

04:05.020 --> 04:11.100
To go from Berkeley to SFO costs just $9 which, inflation adjusted, is the equivalent of $75

04:11.100 --> 04:12.260
today.

04:12.260 --> 04:17.100
With a flight time of 10 minutes and prices comparable to a taxi, the choice for the consumer

04:17.100 --> 04:18.160
was easy.

04:18.160 --> 04:22.620
This route network was primarily intra-city, all flights within the same metro area, but

04:22.620 --> 04:27.980
the hypothetical next phase of this business model's expansion was for inter-city flights.

04:27.980 --> 04:32.540
The idea was that helicopters could replace or augment short-haul flights as a quick way

04:32.540 --> 04:35.100
to get between city centers.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.980
From New York's downtown Manhattan heliport, which is just a 10-minute walk from the New

04:38.980 --> 04:43.220
York Stock Exchange, one could run regular passenger flights reaching Philadelphia in

04:43.220 --> 04:47.620
30 minutes, Baltimore in 60 minutes, and DC in 70.

04:47.620 --> 04:52.620
From Wall Street, the fastest one could reasonably travel door-to-door to DC in a car, train,

04:52.620 --> 04:55.740
or plane would be about four hours.

04:55.740 --> 05:00.620
With a passenger helicopter leaving steps away, that would be cut down to two.

05:00.620 --> 05:06.700
So, helicopters offered the potential of intra-city travel for the same price as taxis, and inter-city

05:06.700 --> 05:08.420
travel in half the time.

05:08.420 --> 05:12.380
With so much promise and potential, what went wrong?

05:12.380 --> 05:17.740
Well, it turns out that it wasn't so much that anything major went wrong, but rather

05:17.740 --> 05:22.340
that, when they started, a lot of things went right.

05:22.340 --> 05:27.580
Most specifically, the helicopter industry in the US was supported by significant federal

05:27.580 --> 05:28.740
subsidies.

05:28.740 --> 05:35.460
Up until 1965, the federal government pumped almost half a billion dollars, inflation adjusted,

05:35.460 --> 05:40.480
into passenger helicopter service in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.

05:40.480 --> 05:46.580
This made it relatively easy for these companies to break even, but then, in 1965, the subsidies

05:46.580 --> 05:48.020
stopped coming.

05:48.020 --> 05:53.300
It was then all and exclusively up to the helicopter airlines themselves to turn a profit,

05:53.300 --> 05:56.740
and that's where the problems started.

05:56.740 --> 05:59.340
Helicopters are tremendously expensive.

05:59.340 --> 06:05.420
A Bell 206, for example, one of the most common passenger helicopters, costs about $600 per

06:05.420 --> 06:10.460
flight hour to operate in terms of fuel, maintenance, and other variable costs.

06:10.460 --> 06:15.540
On top of that, there's the cost to buy it, millions of dollars, the cost of the pilot,

06:15.540 --> 06:19.700
hundreds of dollars per hour, the landing fees, up to hundreds of dollars per flight,

06:19.700 --> 06:23.260
and the cost to run the company managing the helicopter.

06:23.260 --> 06:27.300
This all means that a helicopter like this will cost in the thousands of dollars per

06:27.300 --> 06:32.500
hour to operate, but it can only seat between four and seven people.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.680
That math is simple.

06:34.680 --> 06:39.420
Helicopter companies rely on a steady stream of people who value an hour saved in the many

06:39.420 --> 06:41.520
hundreds of dollars.

06:41.520 --> 06:46.500
That market certainly exists, but at least in the 70s and 80s, it proved too small to

06:46.500 --> 06:51.920
keep helicopter airlines afloat without subsidies, especially after a spate of high-profile accidents

06:51.920 --> 06:57.420
highlighted the increased danger in comparison to airplanes and drove passengers away.

06:57.420 --> 07:02.660
And so, one by one, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York's major helicopter

07:02.660 --> 07:05.260
airlines each failed.

07:05.260 --> 07:10.600
What followed was the dark ages of passenger helicopter airlines.

07:10.600 --> 07:14.820
Market forces whittled these down to just the strongest in the few markets that could

07:14.820 --> 07:18.860
feasibly support scheduled passenger helicopter service.

07:18.860 --> 07:22.500
Those certainly do exist, but there are not many of them.

07:22.500 --> 07:27.700
For example, there has long existed a passenger helicopter airline operating between the financial

07:27.700 --> 07:30.540
hub of Hong Kong and the gambling hub of Macau.

07:30.540 --> 07:36.820
While the cities are only 40 miles or 65 kilometers apart, they sit on opposite sides of the Pearl

07:36.820 --> 07:38.240
River estuary.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.420
The primary means of transportation between the two is therefore an hour-long ferry, however,

07:43.420 --> 07:47.820
for wealthier individuals, of which there are plenty in both Hong Kong and Macau, this

07:47.820 --> 07:53.620
helicopter shuttle connects the two cities in 15 minutes for about $550.

07:53.620 --> 07:57.740
A somewhat similar service exists between the country of Monaco and its closest airport

07:57.740 --> 08:04.140
in Nice, France, turning a 45 or 60 minute drive into a 7 minute, $140 flight, and then

08:04.140 --> 08:08.860
there are a few other less notable examples of scheduled passenger helicopter airlines,

08:08.860 --> 08:13.260
including a couple of subsidized services to isolated places without runways, but for

08:13.260 --> 08:18.740
the most part, few helicopter airlines survived through the turn of the century.

08:18.740 --> 08:22.660
Those dark ages continued until around 2010.

08:22.660 --> 08:27.580
It was at that time when there started a tiny but noticeable renaissance of the business

08:27.580 --> 08:28.580
model.

08:28.580 --> 08:33.020
One of the early innovators in this resurgence was Blade, which grew first by offering flights

08:33.020 --> 08:35.460
from Manhattan to New York's airports.

08:35.460 --> 08:40.740
Other companies soon followed, including Airbus and Uber, to set up similar services all around

08:40.740 --> 08:41.740
the world.

08:41.740 --> 08:46.180
Airbus' effort later closed down, but both Blade and Uber's services have now been

08:46.180 --> 08:48.180
operating for a number of years.

08:48.180 --> 08:52.400
What's notable about Blade in particular is that they have partially fulfilled the

08:52.400 --> 08:58.440
vision that helicopter airlines' innovators imagined decades ago, but mostly not with

08:58.440 --> 08:59.440
helicopters.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.580
They operate flights that travel outside the New York metro area directly from Manhattan,

09:03.580 --> 09:09.940
rather than from LaGuardia, Newark, or JFK, but these are on seaplanes, rather than helicopters.

09:09.940 --> 09:14.940
Leaving from the East River, these reach the Hamptons in 40 minutes or Nantucket in 70

09:14.940 --> 09:18.660
minutesâ€”both popular getaway spots for wealthy New Yorkers.

09:18.660 --> 09:24.140
Prices are steep, at $800 to the Hamptons and $1,100 to Nantucket, but this service

09:24.140 --> 09:31.200
acts as some evidence that some markets can support more expensive service from city centers.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.740
The expansion of such services seemed imminent.

09:34.740 --> 09:40.420
Cape Air, after years of trying, was granted government approval in early 2020 for a one-year

09:40.420 --> 09:45.460
trial period of regularly scheduled passenger seaplane flights between downtown Boston and

09:45.460 --> 09:46.940
downtown New York.

09:46.940 --> 09:51.800
With travel times of an hour and fares around $400, these flights would target a customer

09:51.800 --> 09:56.860
segment much closer to mass market, but at the time of writing, the first of these flights

09:56.860 --> 10:02.380
have yet to be scheduled and the service seemingly might have become a victim of the pandemic-induced

10:02.380 --> 10:04.420
travel downturn.

10:04.420 --> 10:09.740
Seaplanes could be a short-term solution for interurban air travel bypassing airports,

10:09.740 --> 10:14.700
but longer-term, it's clear that the future involves tilt-roader, vertical takeoff, and

10:14.700 --> 10:16.560
landing aircraft.

10:16.560 --> 10:20.780
These aircraft take off like a helicopter, then tilt their propellers 90 degrees to fly

10:20.780 --> 10:22.220
like an airplane.

10:22.220 --> 10:26.540
This allows them to take off without a runway, but achieve speeds and efficiencies far greater

10:26.540 --> 10:28.340
than most helicopters.

10:28.340 --> 10:34.340
Currently, no such aircraft is in non-military passenger service, but plenty are in development.

10:34.380 --> 10:40.300
Uber, for example, has plans to launch air taxi service using such aircraftâ€”initially

10:40.300 --> 10:42.920
in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Melbourne.

10:42.920 --> 10:47.320
It still has huge amounts of regulatory and technological challenges to surpass before

10:47.320 --> 10:53.080
this is possible, but the future of short-haul, premium air travel seemingly might not involve

10:53.080 --> 10:54.080
airports.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.140
Uber's plans involve constructing small skyports, as they call them, around cities,

10:59.140 --> 11:02.860
and these could be as simple as a repurposed parking garage roof.

11:02.860 --> 11:07.940
It's tough to imagine a near-future where the masses are flying from city center to

11:07.940 --> 11:12.060
city center as there's just a natural limit to scale.

11:12.060 --> 11:16.760
The mass-market solution for faster intercity travel is clearly high-speed rail, but the

11:16.760 --> 11:21.340
barrier to entry for private companies in this is enormous considering the infrastructure

11:21.340 --> 11:22.560
requirements.

11:22.560 --> 11:27.000
The beauty of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft is the lack of infrastructure needs,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.780
but that does mean operational costs are much higher.

11:30.780 --> 11:33.900
Projects don't matter as much, though, because such services wouldn't really be

11:33.900 --> 11:37.780
competing against commercial airlines or trains, at least at first.

11:37.780 --> 11:42.620
Rather, they'd be competing against the private aviation market since, for business

11:42.620 --> 11:48.500
travelers, they could offer an overall travel time comparable or better than private jets.

11:48.500 --> 11:54.080
The potential market is quite premium, but penetrating a small yet highly lucrative market

11:54.080 --> 11:59.180
is enough to make expensive city center to city center service worth pursuing for certain

11:59.180 --> 12:00.680
companies.

12:00.680 --> 12:05.560
Whether such a concept will truly be an aspect of the near-future is yet to be seen, but

12:05.560 --> 12:12.600
if it is, it could help solve the paradoxical inefficiency of short-haul air travel.

12:12.600 --> 12:16.800
For those of you looking to make videos just like this one and build up a YouTube channel,

12:16.800 --> 12:22.520
