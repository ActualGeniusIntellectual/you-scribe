00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:16,440
The term, helicopter airline, is one that most are probably not familiar with.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,100
Simply, it's an airline, transporting passengers or cargo, that uses helicopters.

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,900
Of course, not all helicopter companies are truly airlines, since many, if not most civilian

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,600
applications of helicopters do not involve transport.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,200
The people or things inside often land right back where they took off.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,980
Helicopter airlines have been around almost as long as helicopters themselves, but they

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,620
certainly are not widespread.

10
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,400
There was, however, a time when helicopters were believed to be the future of short-haul

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,140
passenger transport.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,060
So what happened?

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,940
The opportunity for helicopter airlines emerged around the 1950s.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,340
When passenger aviation first began, cities' first airports were located rather close to

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,540
the cities themselves as they just didn't need as much space.

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,340
Around the mid-century, New York's primary airport was LaGuardia, Chicago's was Midway,

17
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,800
DC's was National, Paris's was Le Bourget, and Tokyo's was Hanedaâ€”all airports fairly

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
close to their city centers.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,620
These airports were relatively small and generally had short runways, but that wasn't a problem

20
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,460
because passenger demand was small and airplanes were too.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,140
After all, the smaller the airplane, the shorter the runway needed, and vice versa.

22
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,740
These small airports even worked for the long-haul flights of the time since, in general, before

23
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,740
the 1950s, these were done on relatively small airplanes that would make multiple stops on

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,140
longer journeys.

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,720
However, with the introduction of the de Havilland Comet in the 1950s and other passenger jet

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,620
aircraft soon after, airplanes were growing larger, range was increasing, and passenger

27
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,700
demand rose too.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,280
That meant that all these small airports of the past wouldn't cut it, and so, cities

29
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,580
looked to build larger airports more suited for the jet age.

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,260
New York's primary airport shifted from LaGuardia to JFK, Chicago's to O'Hare,

31
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,620
DC's to Dulles, Paris's to Orly, and Tokyo's to Narita.

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,740
Each of these larger airports were further from their city centers, though, as that was

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,580
where there was space.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:21,580
In many cases, the smaller, closer airports remained in operation for domestic or regional

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,580
flights, but in other cases, they closed down.

36
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,620
That's how we got to the reality today where many cities airports are an hour's trip

37
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,320
from the city center.

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,280
Of course, the impact of this distancing varied depending on the type of flights passengers

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,380
were taking.

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,820
For example, with a seven-hour flight from New York to London, the additional 45 or so

41
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,440
minutes it would take to get from Manhattan to JFK over LaGuardia only extends overall

42
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,740
travel time by about 7.5%.

43
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:54,140
However, on the one-hour flight from New York to DC, this would extend travel time by nearly

44
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,760
20%.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,200
This trend of distancing of airports from their cities had little impact on long-haul

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,700
flights, but it had a huge effect on short-haul flights, meaning that planes were now less

47
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,820
competitive compared to cars or trains.

48
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,100
Nowadays, via JFK, it takes just 30 minutes more to travel from Manhattan to downtown

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,860
Charlotte than from Manhattan to downtown DC, even though Charlotte is more than twice

50
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,860
as far.

51
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,140
There are always diminishing marginal returns to air travel's efficiency as distance decreases,

52
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,040
but moving airports further from cities increases this to the point that, below a couple hundred

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,800
miles of distance, airplanes are not the fastest means of travel.

54
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
Helicopter airlines were supposed to solve that.

55
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:43,540
It was quite the niche business model concept, but the 1950s, 60s, and 70s saw a small wave

56
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:48,380
of these, particularly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.

57
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,300
SFO Airlines, for example, operated an extensive network around the Bay Area serving San Jose,

58
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,700
Palo Alto, San Francisco Airport, Oakland Airport, downtown Oakland, downtown San Francisco,

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,020
Marin City, Berkeley, and Concord.

60
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,020
SFO Airlines' fares were quite reasonable.

61
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:11,100
To go from Berkeley to SFO costs just $9 which, inflation adjusted, is the equivalent of $75

62
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,260
today.

63
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,100
With a flight time of 10 minutes and prices comparable to a taxi, the choice for the consumer

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,160
was easy.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,620
This route network was primarily intra-city, all flights within the same metro area, but

66
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,980
the hypothetical next phase of this business model's expansion was for inter-city flights.

67
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,540
The idea was that helicopters could replace or augment short-haul flights as a quick way

68
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,100
to get between city centers.

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,980
From New York's downtown Manhattan heliport, which is just a 10-minute walk from the New

70
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,220
York Stock Exchange, one could run regular passenger flights reaching Philadelphia in

71
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,620
30 minutes, Baltimore in 60 minutes, and DC in 70.

72
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,620
From Wall Street, the fastest one could reasonably travel door-to-door to DC in a car, train,

73
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,740
or plane would be about four hours.

74
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,620
With a passenger helicopter leaving steps away, that would be cut down to two.

75
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,700
So, helicopters offered the potential of intra-city travel for the same price as taxis, and inter-city

76
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,420
travel in half the time.

77
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,380
With so much promise and potential, what went wrong?

78
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,740
Well, it turns out that it wasn't so much that anything major went wrong, but rather

79
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,340
that, when they started, a lot of things went right.

80
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,580
Most specifically, the helicopter industry in the US was supported by significant federal

81
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,740
subsidies.

82
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,460
Up until 1965, the federal government pumped almost half a billion dollars, inflation adjusted,

83
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,480
into passenger helicopter service in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.

84
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,580
This made it relatively easy for these companies to break even, but then, in 1965, the subsidies

85
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,020
stopped coming.

86
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,300
It was then all and exclusively up to the helicopter airlines themselves to turn a profit,

87
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,740
and that's where the problems started.

88
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,340
Helicopters are tremendously expensive.

89
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,420
A Bell 206, for example, one of the most common passenger helicopters, costs about $600 per

90
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,460
flight hour to operate in terms of fuel, maintenance, and other variable costs.

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,540
On top of that, there's the cost to buy it, millions of dollars, the cost of the pilot,

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,700
hundreds of dollars per hour, the landing fees, up to hundreds of dollars per flight,

93
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,260
and the cost to run the company managing the helicopter.

94
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,300
This all means that a helicopter like this will cost in the thousands of dollars per

95
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,500
hour to operate, but it can only seat between four and seven people.

96
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,680
That math is simple.

97
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,420
Helicopter companies rely on a steady stream of people who value an hour saved in the many

98
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,520
hundreds of dollars.

99
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,500
That market certainly exists, but at least in the 70s and 80s, it proved too small to

100
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,920
keep helicopter airlines afloat without subsidies, especially after a spate of high-profile accidents

101
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,420
highlighted the increased danger in comparison to airplanes and drove passengers away.

102
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,660
And so, one by one, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York's major helicopter

103
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,260
airlines each failed.

104
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,600
What followed was the dark ages of passenger helicopter airlines.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,820
Market forces whittled these down to just the strongest in the few markets that could

106
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,860
feasibly support scheduled passenger helicopter service.

107
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,500
Those certainly do exist, but there are not many of them.

108
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,700
For example, there has long existed a passenger helicopter airline operating between the financial

109
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,540
hub of Hong Kong and the gambling hub of Macau.

110
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,820
While the cities are only 40 miles or 65 kilometers apart, they sit on opposite sides of the Pearl

111
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,240
River estuary.

112
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,420
The primary means of transportation between the two is therefore an hour-long ferry, however,

113
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,820
for wealthier individuals, of which there are plenty in both Hong Kong and Macau, this

114
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,620
helicopter shuttle connects the two cities in 15 minutes for about $550.

115
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,740
A somewhat similar service exists between the country of Monaco and its closest airport

116
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,140
in Nice, France, turning a 45 or 60 minute drive into a 7 minute, $140 flight, and then

117
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:08,860
there are a few other less notable examples of scheduled passenger helicopter airlines,

118
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,260
including a couple of subsidized services to isolated places without runways, but for

119
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,740
the most part, few helicopter airlines survived through the turn of the century.

120
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,660
Those dark ages continued until around 2010.

121
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,580
It was at that time when there started a tiny but noticeable renaissance of the business

122
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
model.

123
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,020
One of the early innovators in this resurgence was Blade, which grew first by offering flights

124
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,460
from Manhattan to New York's airports.

125
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,740
Other companies soon followed, including Airbus and Uber, to set up similar services all around

126
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,740
the world.

127
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,180
Airbus' effort later closed down, but both Blade and Uber's services have now been

128
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,180
operating for a number of years.

129
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:52,400
What's notable about Blade in particular is that they have partially fulfilled the

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,440
vision that helicopter airlines' innovators imagined decades ago, but mostly not with

131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
helicopters.

132
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,580
They operate flights that travel outside the New York metro area directly from Manhattan,

133
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,940
rather than from LaGuardia, Newark, or JFK, but these are on seaplanes, rather than helicopters.

134
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,940
Leaving from the East River, these reach the Hamptons in 40 minutes or Nantucket in 70

135
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,660
minutesâ€”both popular getaway spots for wealthy New Yorkers.

136
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,140
Prices are steep, at $800 to the Hamptons and $1,100 to Nantucket, but this service

137
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:31,200
acts as some evidence that some markets can support more expensive service from city centers.

138
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,740
The expansion of such services seemed imminent.

139
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,420
Cape Air, after years of trying, was granted government approval in early 2020 for a one-year

140
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,460
trial period of regularly scheduled passenger seaplane flights between downtown Boston and

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,940
downtown New York.

142
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,800
With travel times of an hour and fares around $400, these flights would target a customer

143
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,860
segment much closer to mass market, but at the time of writing, the first of these flights

144
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,380
have yet to be scheduled and the service seemingly might have become a victim of the pandemic-induced

145
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,420
travel downturn.

146
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,740
Seaplanes could be a short-term solution for interurban air travel bypassing airports,

147
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,700
but longer-term, it's clear that the future involves tilt-roader, vertical takeoff, and

148
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,560
landing aircraft.

149
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,780
These aircraft take off like a helicopter, then tilt their propellers 90 degrees to fly

150
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,220
like an airplane.

151
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,540
This allows them to take off without a runway, but achieve speeds and efficiencies far greater

152
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,340
than most helicopters.

153
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Currently, no such aircraft is in non-military passenger service, but plenty are in development.

154
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,300
Uber, for example, has plans to launch air taxi service using such aircraftâ€”initially

155
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,920
in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Melbourne.

156
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,320
It still has huge amounts of regulatory and technological challenges to surpass before

157
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,080
this is possible, but the future of short-haul, premium air travel seemingly might not involve

158
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
airports.

159
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:59,140
Uber's plans involve constructing small skyports, as they call them, around cities,

160
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,860
and these could be as simple as a repurposed parking garage roof.

161
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:07,940
It's tough to imagine a near-future where the masses are flying from city center to

162
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,060
city center as there's just a natural limit to scale.

163
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,760
The mass-market solution for faster intercity travel is clearly high-speed rail, but the

164
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,340
barrier to entry for private companies in this is enormous considering the infrastructure

165
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,560
requirements.

166
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,000
The beauty of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft is the lack of infrastructure needs,

167
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,780
but that does mean operational costs are much higher.

168
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,900
Projects don't matter as much, though, because such services wouldn't really be

169
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,780
competing against commercial airlines or trains, at least at first.

170
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:42,620
Rather, they'd be competing against the private aviation market since, for business

171
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,500
travelers, they could offer an overall travel time comparable or better than private jets.

172
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,080
The potential market is quite premium, but penetrating a small yet highly lucrative market

173
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,180
is enough to make expensive city center to city center service worth pursuing for certain

174
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,680
companies.

175
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,560
Whether such a concept will truly be an aspect of the near-future is yet to be seen, but

176
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:12,600
if it is, it could help solve the paradoxical inefficiency of short-haul air travel.

177
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,800
For those of you looking to make videos just like this one and build up a YouTube channel,

178
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,520
I have three recommendations for Skillshare courses that will help you do that successfully.

179
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,680
First is going viralâ€”write, film, and make content people share.

180
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,320
Second is creative video storytelling and editingâ€”making the most of stock footage.

181
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:36,360
And third is the productivity masterclassâ€”creating a custom system that works.

182
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,160
That way you know how to write YouTube videos well, you know how to edit YouTube videos

183
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,120
well, and you know how to manage your time well to balance creation with whatever else

184
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,360
you do.

185
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,800
Skillshare is what I use when I want to learn new skills, so I can certainly tell you from

186
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,720
experience that the quality and variety of their classes is unmatched.

187
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,940
We specialize in helping creative and curious people upskill, so learn something new or
