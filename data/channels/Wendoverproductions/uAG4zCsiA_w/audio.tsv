10540	16440	The term, helicopter airline, is one that most are probably not familiar with.
16440	22100	Simply, it's an airline, transporting passengers or cargo, that uses helicopters.
22100	27900	Of course, not all helicopter companies are truly airlines, since many, if not most civilian
27900	31600	applications of helicopters do not involve transport.
31600	36200	The people or things inside often land right back where they took off.
36200	39980	Helicopter airlines have been around almost as long as helicopters themselves, but they
39980	42620	certainly are not widespread.
42620	47400	There was, however, a time when helicopters were believed to be the future of short-haul
47400	49140	passenger transport.
49140	51060	So what happened?
51060	55940	The opportunity for helicopter airlines emerged around the 1950s.
55940	60340	When passenger aviation first began, cities' first airports were located rather close to
60340	64540	the cities themselves as they just didn't need as much space.
64540	69340	Around the mid-century, New York's primary airport was LaGuardia, Chicago's was Midway,
69340	74800	DC's was National, Paris's was Le Bourget, and Tokyo's was Haneda—all airports fairly
74800	76800	close to their city centers.
76800	81620	These airports were relatively small and generally had short runways, but that wasn't a problem
81620	85460	because passenger demand was small and airplanes were too.
85460	90140	After all, the smaller the airplane, the shorter the runway needed, and vice versa.
90140	94740	These small airports even worked for the long-haul flights of the time since, in general, before
94740	99740	the 1950s, these were done on relatively small airplanes that would make multiple stops on
99740	101140	longer journeys.
101140	105720	However, with the introduction of the de Havilland Comet in the 1950s and other passenger jet
105720	110620	aircraft soon after, airplanes were growing larger, range was increasing, and passenger
110620	112700	demand rose too.
112700	117280	That meant that all these small airports of the past wouldn't cut it, and so, cities
117280	121580	looked to build larger airports more suited for the jet age.
121580	126260	New York's primary airport shifted from LaGuardia to JFK, Chicago's to O'Hare,
126260	130620	DC's to Dulles, Paris's to Orly, and Tokyo's to Narita.
130620	134740	Each of these larger airports were further from their city centers, though, as that was
134740	136580	where there was space.
136580	141580	In many cases, the smaller, closer airports remained in operation for domestic or regional
141580	144580	flights, but in other cases, they closed down.
144580	149620	That's how we got to the reality today where many cities airports are an hour's trip
149620	151320	from the city center.
151320	156280	Of course, the impact of this distancing varied depending on the type of flights passengers
156280	157380	were taking.
157380	161820	For example, with a seven-hour flight from New York to London, the additional 45 or so
161820	166440	minutes it would take to get from Manhattan to JFK over LaGuardia only extends overall
166440	168740	travel time by about 7.5%.
168740	174140	However, on the one-hour flight from New York to DC, this would extend travel time by nearly
174140	175760	20%.
175760	180200	This trend of distancing of airports from their cities had little impact on long-haul
180200	184700	flights, but it had a huge effect on short-haul flights, meaning that planes were now less
184700	187820	competitive compared to cars or trains.
187820	193100	Nowadays, via JFK, it takes just 30 minutes more to travel from Manhattan to downtown
193100	197860	Charlotte than from Manhattan to downtown DC, even though Charlotte is more than twice
197860	198860	as far.
198860	204140	There are always diminishing marginal returns to air travel's efficiency as distance decreases,
204140	209040	but moving airports further from cities increases this to the point that, below a couple hundred
209040	214800	miles of distance, airplanes are not the fastest means of travel.
214800	217400	Helicopter airlines were supposed to solve that.
217400	223540	It was quite the niche business model concept, but the 1950s, 60s, and 70s saw a small wave
223540	228380	of these, particularly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.
228380	234300	SFO Airlines, for example, operated an extensive network around the Bay Area serving San Jose,
234300	239700	Palo Alto, San Francisco Airport, Oakland Airport, downtown Oakland, downtown San Francisco,
239700	242020	Marin City, Berkeley, and Concord.
242020	245020	SFO Airlines' fares were quite reasonable.
245020	251100	To go from Berkeley to SFO costs just $9 which, inflation adjusted, is the equivalent of $75
251100	252260	today.
252260	257100	With a flight time of 10 minutes and prices comparable to a taxi, the choice for the consumer
257100	258160	was easy.
258160	262620	This route network was primarily intra-city, all flights within the same metro area, but
262620	267980	the hypothetical next phase of this business model's expansion was for inter-city flights.
267980	272540	The idea was that helicopters could replace or augment short-haul flights as a quick way
272540	275100	to get between city centers.
275100	278980	From New York's downtown Manhattan heliport, which is just a 10-minute walk from the New
278980	283220	York Stock Exchange, one could run regular passenger flights reaching Philadelphia in
283220	287620	30 minutes, Baltimore in 60 minutes, and DC in 70.
287620	292620	From Wall Street, the fastest one could reasonably travel door-to-door to DC in a car, train,
292620	295740	or plane would be about four hours.
295740	300620	With a passenger helicopter leaving steps away, that would be cut down to two.
300620	306700	So, helicopters offered the potential of intra-city travel for the same price as taxis, and inter-city
306700	308420	travel in half the time.
308420	312380	With so much promise and potential, what went wrong?
312380	317740	Well, it turns out that it wasn't so much that anything major went wrong, but rather
317740	322340	that, when they started, a lot of things went right.
322340	327580	Most specifically, the helicopter industry in the US was supported by significant federal
327580	328740	subsidies.
328740	335460	Up until 1965, the federal government pumped almost half a billion dollars, inflation adjusted,
335460	340480	into passenger helicopter service in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York.
340480	346580	This made it relatively easy for these companies to break even, but then, in 1965, the subsidies
346580	348020	stopped coming.
348020	353300	It was then all and exclusively up to the helicopter airlines themselves to turn a profit,
353300	356740	and that's where the problems started.
356740	359340	Helicopters are tremendously expensive.
359340	365420	A Bell 206, for example, one of the most common passenger helicopters, costs about $600 per
365420	370460	flight hour to operate in terms of fuel, maintenance, and other variable costs.
370460	375540	On top of that, there's the cost to buy it, millions of dollars, the cost of the pilot,
375540	379700	hundreds of dollars per hour, the landing fees, up to hundreds of dollars per flight,
379700	383260	and the cost to run the company managing the helicopter.
383260	387300	This all means that a helicopter like this will cost in the thousands of dollars per
387300	392500	hour to operate, but it can only seat between four and seven people.
392500	394680	That math is simple.
394680	399420	Helicopter companies rely on a steady stream of people who value an hour saved in the many
399420	401520	hundreds of dollars.
401520	406500	That market certainly exists, but at least in the 70s and 80s, it proved too small to
406500	411920	keep helicopter airlines afloat without subsidies, especially after a spate of high-profile accidents
411920	417420	highlighted the increased danger in comparison to airplanes and drove passengers away.
417420	422660	And so, one by one, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York's major helicopter
422660	425260	airlines each failed.
425260	430600	What followed was the dark ages of passenger helicopter airlines.
430600	434820	Market forces whittled these down to just the strongest in the few markets that could
434820	438860	feasibly support scheduled passenger helicopter service.
438860	442500	Those certainly do exist, but there are not many of them.
442500	447700	For example, there has long existed a passenger helicopter airline operating between the financial
447700	450540	hub of Hong Kong and the gambling hub of Macau.
450540	456820	While the cities are only 40 miles or 65 kilometers apart, they sit on opposite sides of the Pearl
456820	458240	River estuary.
458240	463420	The primary means of transportation between the two is therefore an hour-long ferry, however,
463420	467820	for wealthier individuals, of which there are plenty in both Hong Kong and Macau, this
467820	473620	helicopter shuttle connects the two cities in 15 minutes for about $550.
473620	477740	A somewhat similar service exists between the country of Monaco and its closest airport
477740	484140	in Nice, France, turning a 45 or 60 minute drive into a 7 minute, $140 flight, and then
484140	488860	there are a few other less notable examples of scheduled passenger helicopter airlines,
488860	493260	including a couple of subsidized services to isolated places without runways, but for
493260	498740	the most part, few helicopter airlines survived through the turn of the century.
498740	502660	Those dark ages continued until around 2010.
502660	507580	It was at that time when there started a tiny but noticeable renaissance of the business
507580	508580	model.
508580	513020	One of the early innovators in this resurgence was Blade, which grew first by offering flights
513020	515460	from Manhattan to New York's airports.
515460	520740	Other companies soon followed, including Airbus and Uber, to set up similar services all around
520740	521740	the world.
521740	526180	Airbus' effort later closed down, but both Blade and Uber's services have now been
526180	528180	operating for a number of years.
528180	532400	What's notable about Blade in particular is that they have partially fulfilled the
532400	538440	vision that helicopter airlines' innovators imagined decades ago, but mostly not with
538440	539440	helicopters.
539440	543580	They operate flights that travel outside the New York metro area directly from Manhattan,
543580	549940	rather than from LaGuardia, Newark, or JFK, but these are on seaplanes, rather than helicopters.
549940	554940	Leaving from the East River, these reach the Hamptons in 40 minutes or Nantucket in 70
554940	558660	minutes—both popular getaway spots for wealthy New Yorkers.
558660	564140	Prices are steep, at $800 to the Hamptons and $1,100 to Nantucket, but this service
564140	571200	acts as some evidence that some markets can support more expensive service from city centers.
571200	574740	The expansion of such services seemed imminent.
574740	580420	Cape Air, after years of trying, was granted government approval in early 2020 for a one-year
580420	585460	trial period of regularly scheduled passenger seaplane flights between downtown Boston and
585460	586940	downtown New York.
586940	591800	With travel times of an hour and fares around $400, these flights would target a customer
591800	596860	segment much closer to mass market, but at the time of writing, the first of these flights
596860	602380	have yet to be scheduled and the service seemingly might have become a victim of the pandemic-induced
602380	604420	travel downturn.
604420	609740	Seaplanes could be a short-term solution for interurban air travel bypassing airports,
609740	614700	but longer-term, it's clear that the future involves tilt-roader, vertical takeoff, and
614700	616560	landing aircraft.
616560	620780	These aircraft take off like a helicopter, then tilt their propellers 90 degrees to fly
620780	622220	like an airplane.
622220	626540	This allows them to take off without a runway, but achieve speeds and efficiencies far greater
626540	628340	than most helicopters.
628340	634340	Currently, no such aircraft is in non-military passenger service, but plenty are in development.
634380	640300	Uber, for example, has plans to launch air taxi service using such aircraft—initially
640300	642920	in Dallas, Los Angeles, and Melbourne.
642920	647320	It still has huge amounts of regulatory and technological challenges to surpass before
647320	653080	this is possible, but the future of short-haul, premium air travel seemingly might not involve
653080	654080	airports.
654080	659140	Uber's plans involve constructing small skyports, as they call them, around cities,
659140	662860	and these could be as simple as a repurposed parking garage roof.
662860	667940	It's tough to imagine a near-future where the masses are flying from city center to
667940	672060	city center as there's just a natural limit to scale.
672060	676760	The mass-market solution for faster intercity travel is clearly high-speed rail, but the
676760	681340	barrier to entry for private companies in this is enormous considering the infrastructure
681340	682560	requirements.
682560	687000	The beauty of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft is the lack of infrastructure needs,
687000	690780	but that does mean operational costs are much higher.
690780	693900	Projects don't matter as much, though, because such services wouldn't really be
693900	697780	competing against commercial airlines or trains, at least at first.
697780	702620	Rather, they'd be competing against the private aviation market since, for business
702620	708500	travelers, they could offer an overall travel time comparable or better than private jets.
708500	714080	The potential market is quite premium, but penetrating a small yet highly lucrative market
714080	719180	is enough to make expensive city center to city center service worth pursuing for certain
719180	720680	companies.
720680	725560	Whether such a concept will truly be an aspect of the near-future is yet to be seen, but
725560	732600	if it is, it could help solve the paradoxical inefficiency of short-haul air travel.
