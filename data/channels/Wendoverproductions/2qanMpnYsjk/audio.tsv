11020	16620	About 13 million times per day, someone clicks the order button on Amazon.com.
16620	21840	Some days later, all, or at least almost all, of those 13 million orders arrive at their
21840	22960	destination.
22960	26040	But, what happens in between?
26040	29000	How does Amazon get a package to you?
29000	32000	Well, it depends—a lot.
32000	37480	In fact, Amazon's fulfillment system, their shipping system, is more complicated and convoluted
37480	43840	than that of almost any logistics company—it's far more complicated than that of UPS or FedEx
43840	47360	or DHL or any other major delivery company.
47360	52440	In a counterintuitive way, this complicated and convoluted fulfillment system is a crucial
52440	56800	component of this secret sauce that's driving Amazon's success.
56800	62240	They're striving to make the consumer experience simple through behind-the-scenes complexity.
62240	66140	So, back to the question, how does an Amazon package get to you?
66140	67200	And the answer?
67200	68200	It depends.
68200	72940	It depends first on who's fulfilling the package—Amazon or the seller.
72940	77460	About one-fourth of sales in the US are fulfilled directly by the seller, as most products on
77460	81960	Amazon are listed there by a third party, which can send packages directly through UPS,
81960	86680	FedEx, the Postal Service, or another consumer delivery company if they choose.
86680	90740	Amazon has nothing to do with the fulfillment of those orders, and the process looks largely
90740	93680	the same as with any other e-commerce company.
93680	99280	What's different is how the other three-quarters of Amazon packages in the US get to you—the
99280	102000	ones that are fulfilled directly by Amazon.
102000	106720	The path that these take depends first on how big the package is.
106720	112160	You see, Amazon's fulfillment centers are more or less split into three categories—small
112160	115600	sortable, large sortable, and large non-sortable.
115600	121120	That first category, small sortable, represents the bread and butter of Amazon's business.
121120	126560	These are items that are less than 12 by 16 by 6 inches or 30 by 40 by 15 centimeters
126560	130780	in size, and about 25 pounds or 11 kilograms in weight.
130780	135220	The next category, large sortable, is basically anything larger than this up to a weight of
135220	137760	about 60 pounds or 27 kilograms.
137760	142740	Now, the reasons for the split between large and small is because the fulfillment operations
142740	148600	of smaller items is much easier to automate—they can fit on conveyor belts and automated robots
148600	152140	and other tools that lower the company's reliance on humans.
152140	157020	For example, Amazon uses a robot called the Kiva which fundamentally changed the way the
157020	162060	job of the company's pickers—the people who find and grab an item out of storage—worked.
162060	167540	Previously, pickers would walk some 10 to 12 miles or 16 to 19 kilometers a day through
167540	169580	cavernous rows of shelves.
169580	174980	Now, at least in their most advanced fulfillment centers, a robot picks up an entire mobile
174980	179820	shelf on which a required product is located and transports it to the picker who picks
179820	180820	it.
180820	185580	Essentially, rather than the picker going to the shelf, the shelf goes to the picker.
185580	191760	With these robots, one person can pick 300 to 400 items an hour rather than the 100 or
191760	193780	so that was possible on foot.
193780	197800	Of course, fewer humans in the mix is good for Amazon, given the amount of criticism
197800	202360	it receives for its treatment of workers, and because humans, even low-paid ones, are
202360	203700	expensive.
203700	208160	The fulfillment process for larger items, though, is just tougher to automate cheaply,
208160	212680	so the company chooses to segment the two processes out, and runs a far more manual
212680	215840	and distinct fulfillment system for larger items.
215840	221760	However, in most but not all cases, the fulfillment centers for large and small items are under
221760	225560	the same roof, even if they're operated completely independently.
225560	229760	Of course, the ideal scenario for Amazon would be to have every single item they sell
229760	233360	in every single warehouse, but that's not realistic.
233360	238560	Therefore, they use predictive modeling to try to put items closest to those who are
238560	240200	likely to buy them.
240200	245520	The US is far from homogeneous, so demand for different products varies from place to
245520	246520	place.
246520	251320	For example, in Miami, people probably aren't looking to buy many ice scrapers for their
251320	252320	cars.
252320	257200	Meanwhile, in Fargo, North Dakota, demand for this item is almost certainly quite high.
257200	262000	It's therefore no wonder why that, if you look at the data, the colder the city, the
262000	265400	faster you can get an ice scraper on Amazon.
265400	268280	That is Amazon's predictive stocking at work.
268280	273740	While most examples of this system are far more nuanced and far less intuitive, the concept
273740	277620	is simple—their algorithms put products closest to the consumers most likely to buy
277620	282720	them—something only possible at this scale thanks to modern big data analytics.
282720	288620	Of course, there's then that third category of products—large non-sortable.
288620	292820	The distinction here is because Amazon likes to aggregate products together into as few
292820	297900	packages as possible—unsurprisingly, fewer packages equals lower costs.
297900	303060	So, both these sortable categories include anything that could possibly be packaged together
303060	304680	in a single box.
304680	310460	The largest items, say a 70-pound beanbag, for example, are shipped from the large, non-sortable
310460	312140	fulfillment centers.
312140	316520	These facilities are even less automated than the large, sortable ones, and even include
316520	320340	workers who create custom boxes for odd-sized items.
320340	325420	In Colorado, for example, this is a completely separate facility, located in Aurora, from
325420	327940	the sortable fulfillment center in Thornton.
327940	332860	Now, some large items will go directly into the system of a third-party provider, typically
332860	337800	XPL Logistics, which would deliver these bulky items to their final destination, while
337800	340860	others will continue on in Amazon's system.
340860	345980	The portion of large, non-sortable items not sent to a third-party logistics provider plus
345980	350540	all the large and small sortable packages would next be sent to a regional sortation
350540	351540	center.
351540	356060	In Colorado, those two fulfillment centers send their packages to a single sortation
356060	360380	center, located just minutes away from the Aurora fulfillment center.
360380	365700	This is a massive facility, almost half a million square feet in size, with robots running
365700	370380	around, dropping packages into different chutes, which each represent a different grouping
370380	371500	of zip codes.
371500	378020	Now, not all the sortation centers are quite so automated, but each outputs the same thing—pallets
378020	381540	of packages going to roughly the same place.
381540	385300	What happens next, though, once again, depends.
385300	389720	A package heading to Miami, for example, would end up on a pallet with other packages for
389760	394440	Miami, which itself would end up on a truck carrying pallets for Tampa, North Carolina,
394440	399520	Houston, Baltimore, New York City, Connecticut, and a few other cities and states to the east.
399520	404980	This truck would then drive the 15 minutes to a waiting 767 cargo plane at Denver International
404980	407960	Airport, branded in Prime Air livery.
407960	414640	Now, Amazon Air started in 2015 with its lease of about 20 aircraft from Air Transport International,
414640	419200	and has since grown to almost 70 aircraft—all leased from other airlines.
419200	423920	However, the company recently announced the purchase of their first 11 aircraft, also
423920	429320	767, bought from Delta and WestJet, meaning they'll soon both own and operate their
429320	430980	own aircraft.
430980	435380	Those eastbound pallets would all be loaded around 4 AM, before the aircraft's scheduled
435380	437880	departure time of 4.54 AM.
437880	443740	Now, anyone familiar with UPS or FedEx's operations will know why this departure time
443740	445120	is strange.
445120	449480	If UPS was transporting this package to Miami, at least at its fastest speed, it would have
449480	454260	departed on an aircraft the previous night at 9.40 PM, been flown to Louisville, sorted
454260	458520	through the company's hub, then flown to Miami, arriving at 5.50 AM.
458520	461560	FedEx would have done roughly the same, just through Memphis instead.
461560	466540	That's because FedEx, UPS, and most other major delivery companies are oriented towards
466540	470560	overnight delivery—they make a big chunk of their money charging big rates to take
470560	475240	a package from one part of the US one day, and deliver it to another the next day.
475240	480680	Amazon, meanwhile, built their prime brand off the promise of two-day delivery—ordering
480680	483800	a package on a Monday and getting it on a Wednesday, for example.
483800	488560	While they've sent straight from the rigidness of that system, the fastest shipping they'll
488560	493340	offer for an item not stocked at a local fulfillment center is two days, meaning they don't have
493340	496840	to worry about being able to get a package from Denver to Miami overnight.
497320	501760	That's why UPS and FedEx's planes take off in the evening, while Amazon's leave
501760	502760	in the morning.
502760	508480	So, that means it's about 9 AM by the time that Amazon Airplane from Denver gets to Cincinnati
508480	510500	Airport each day.
510500	515120	Through the morning hours, a dozen or so aircraft land in Cincinnati, and this timing gives
515120	518120	the company a major advantage.
518120	523680	Cincinnati Airport is also home to DHL's main America's hub, but DHL, like FedEx
523680	529040	and UPS, conducts its operations primarily overnight starting at around midnight, when
529040	533400	dozens of their aircraft from around the world land and unload.
533400	538360	Over the next few hours, packages and pallets are sorted and unloaded onto other aircraft,
538360	540780	which all tend to take off by 8 AM.
540780	546320	That means DHL only really uses their facility during the overnight hours, so Amazon leases
546320	548360	it for daytime use.
548360	553320	While Amazon is building their own, larger facility at Cincinnati Airport, this partnership
553320	555760	gave them a huge head start.
555760	561600	So, each day, between 8 AM and 4 PM, Amazon's there, turning their planes around, and sorting
561600	566400	pallets from where they come from, like Denver, to where they need to go, like Miami.
566400	571340	That Miami flight takes off each weekday at 2.15 PM, and then it lands in Florida just
571340	573880	before 5 PM Eastern Time.
573880	578520	Now, not every Amazon Air itinerary looks like this.
578520	582860	In fact, while UPS and FedEx route almost all of their flights through their Louisville
582900	587140	and Memphis super hubs, or through some of their secondary hubs across the country, only
587140	591540	20% of Amazon Air's flights go through their main Cincinnati hub.
591540	596940	That's because, with their orientation towards two-day delivery versus one, they just have
596940	598660	more time.
598660	603300	The more time means that, in order to service the entirety of Florida, Amazon only needs
603300	607620	to fly to three destinations—Miami, Tampa, and Lakeland.
607620	612380	That's because Amazon's flights to these airports typically land by 5 PM, meaning there's
612900	618580	12 hours before packages have to be at the local delivery center for the final destination.
618580	623500	The entirety of Florida is within an eight-hour drive of Lakeland, meaning Amazon can deliver
623500	629300	to all of Florida by only serving effectively one, but in practice three, airports.
629300	634540	Meanwhile, FedEx, for example, flies from Memphis to Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville,
634540	638720	Tallahassee, Tampa, and Palm Beach, then from Fort Lauderdale it operates feeder flights
638720	641460	on smaller aircraft to Key West and Marathon.
641540	647940	So, in summary, in order to serve all of Florida, this is what FedEx has to do, and this is
647940	649900	what Amazon has to do.
649900	654900	The required number of destinations for full coverage is greatly reduced by orienting for
654900	659260	two-day delivery, and this also means that Amazon doesn't have to route every flight
659260	661660	via one main hub.
661660	666660	Because they operate to far fewer destinations, it's much easier for Amazon to fill a plane
666660	671180	from California, for example, exclusively with packages destined for Florida, since
671180	676340	while a given UPS or FedEx flight carries packages from or to just one city, a given
676340	681900	Amazon Air flight likely carries packages from or to a whole state or region.
681900	687260	Therefore, Amazon Air has flights from all these airports to Lakeland, meaning that,
687260	691340	while a package from Denver would have to route via Cincinnati, one from Los Angeles
691340	695220	or Dallas or Chicago could fly direct.
695220	699600	With a full hub-and-spoke strategy, like that of UPS or FedEx, a package would have
699600	705020	to be loaded and unloaded from aircraft twice, and sometimes more, while Amazon Air's non-stop
705020	710140	flights only require loading and unloading once, which reduces cost, and can fly packages
710140	712780	direct, which also reduces cost.
712780	718700	This is how Amazon can transport packages by air more efficiently than UPS or FedEx.
718700	723900	The airplane, however, is just one of five routes that an Amazon package could take onwards
723900	726300	from the Denver Sortation Center.
726300	730240	For those that are to be delivered locally, in the Denver area, they'll be driven to
730240	732780	one of four delivery stations for Denver.
732780	737280	There, they'll be loaded into smaller delivery vans, operated by independent companies or
737280	742580	individuals contracted by Amazon, which will take the packages to their final destinations.
742580	747760	This is the one and only case in which an Amazon package is handled by Amazon Logistics
747760	751820	from start to finish, and it's generally how their packages are delivered within major
751820	754220	urban and suburban areas.
754220	758600	Only a slim majority of their overall package volume is delivered this way, though, as when
758600	763260	you leave major urban areas, things get a bit more complicated.
763260	768460	Now, a package heading outside the Denver area with a later delivery date, or with a
768460	773980	destination within the greater Rockies region, would end up on an Amazon-branded but independently
773980	775940	operated semi-truck.
775940	781360	For example, packages to the Aspen area, about a three to four hour drive into the mountains,
781360	783600	arrive at around 1 AM each night.
783600	788000	Early in the morning, however, at around 5 AM, they arrive at the local post office and
788000	792320	from there, they're fully transferred into the United States Postal Service system for
792320	793940	final delivery.
793940	798300	You see, in less populous areas, like the mountains of Colorado, it just doesn't make
798300	801720	sense for Amazon to operate their own last-mile delivery.
801720	806280	They need a certain amount of scale for that to be cheaper than the alternative, and at
806280	810520	least right now, that scale is only possible in major metro areas.
810520	816340	Therefore, they need alternatives for smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and that alternative
816340	818560	is more often than not the USPS.
818560	823520	That's because the Postal Service charges very low rates for last-mile delivery, assuming
823520	827720	Amazon transports the packages to the local post offices themselves.
827720	833060	While exact numbers aren't publicly known, estimates indicate the USPS charges Amazon
833060	838280	about $2 per package for last-mile delivery—about half of what other delivery companies would
838280	840160	for the same service.
840160	845720	After all, the USPS services every address in America, so wherever Amazon needs to deliver,
845720	848080	the USPS is going there anyways.
848080	853600	That's why, for smaller places that still have a decent volume of packages, like mid-sized
853600	859160	towns and cities, USPS delivery is often the cheapest option for Amazon.
859160	865560	But then, there's that next step down—the most rural places in America.
865560	870040	Anything that can't be cheaply delivered by Amazon or the USPS, typically because they're
870040	874020	destined for low-density areas where you couldn't even fill a truck to send to the local post
874020	879080	office, or because of capacity or speed reasons, is sent through UPS.
879080	883680	Right now, it's believed that about 20% of Amazon's packages end up delivered by
883680	884680	UPS.
884680	889340	In Colorado, a package destined for the most rural areas, like the western edge of San
889340	892920	Miguel County, for example, would take this route.
892920	896560	It would cost Amazon far more, and they'd likely end up losing money on the cheapest
896560	900960	items, but it's what's required for them to be able to service every address in the
900960	902900	US quickly.
902900	907540	No matter which of these routes a package takes, the end result is, at least hopefully,
907540	908540	the same.
908540	913760	UPS, the USPS, or Amazon itself drops off a package at its final destinations after
913760	916000	a few days of travel across the US.
916000	921560	It's a very simple process from a consumer perspective, but the behind-the-scenes is
921560	923360	incredibly complex.
923360	928080	The complexity is what's needed, though, for a business whose whole value proposition
928080	931740	is to get anything to your door quickly and cheaply.
931740	938140	The core of Amazon—their competitive advantage—is now logistics, to the point where many experts
938140	942520	believe that the company will start offering delivery as a service to other companies in
942520	943520	the coming years.
943520	946840	They believe that they've perfected their system enough that they're going to take
946840	949460	on UPS and FedEx.
949460	954060	Of course, Amazon still has competitors, which are going after the company as aggressively
954060	955060	as ever.
955060	960040	Target, for example, has been able to build a delivery system with similar speed through
960040	963500	completely different means—ones that are far simpler.
963500	968440	They've essentially turned each of their 1,900 stores across every US state into a
968440	974360	fulfillment center—they send employees out into the aisles who pick, pack, and ship online
974360	975560	orders.
975560	979800	That means that their packages never have to travel very far at all, and so they can
979800	985040	take advantage of cheap and quick ground shipping from UPS, FedEx, and other more traditional
985040	986200	providers.
986200	991160	Some 80% of the company's orders are fulfilled directly from its stores, and now Walmart
991160	995680	is also adapting this direct-from-store fulfillment system as well.
995680	1000380	So far, though, Amazon believes in their system of simplicity through complexity, and they're
1000380	1004640	making moves to further expand the system within the US, and emulate it in Europe, where
1004640	1008680	they recently opened their first airhub in Leipzig and put their first two freight aircraft
1008680	1010560	online in November 2020.
1010560	1016600	UPS, FedEx, and the other major consumer delivery companies are already well aware of just how
1016600	1019500	big a threat Amazon poses to them.
1019500	1024540	Amazon has managed to build a 21st century logistics network using 21st century techniques
1024540	1028840	and technologies, and, of course, part of the threat comes from the company's market
1028840	1034500	dominance, but most is because Amazon is innovating in a way others aren't.
1034500	1040060	The way FedEx and UPS moved packages today is largely the same way they did decades ago,
1040060	1044560	but Amazon's system is only possible through innovations that allow them to manage such
1044560	1048040	a massive, complex, and convoluted system.
1048040	1052680	This is all to say, if you're worried about Amazon's growing position as the one-stop
1052680	1059020	shop for the world, be worried, because they're only getting better at it.
1059020	1063840	What Amazon's rise proves more than anything is that, like it or not, online is the new
1063840	1065000	Main Street.
1065000	1069700	Therefore, just as you'd be concerned with what your storefront looks like on Main Street,
1069700	1072840	you should be concerned about how your web presence looks.
1072840	1078360	Now, in the case of email, having a non-custom address is the equivalent of having a dirty
1078360	1080920	sign—it works, but it's not pretty.
1080920	1085760	That's why you'll notice that most professionals use custom email addresses—something that
1085760	1087840	ends in something like "@wendover.productions."
1087840	1093400	That's a domain that I bought through Hover, made possible thanks to their over 400 unique
1093400	1098240	domain extensions that let you go way beyond .com, .org, or .net.
1098240	1102000	After getting that domain, it took about two minutes to set up a custom email address for
1102000	1104640	myself and everyone else who works on the channel.
1104640	1109240	I can't count the number of times when someone has complimented our email address, as weird
1109240	1113760	as that sounds, and so whether you run a business, or just want a better email for yourself,
1113760	1116720	it's worth getting a custom one with Hover.
1116720	1121920	So, head to hover.com slash wendover to get 10% off your first purchase of a custom domain
1121920	1125920	or email address, and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
