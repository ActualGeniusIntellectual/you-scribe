00:11.020 --> 00:16.620
About 13 million times per day, someone clicks the order button on Amazon.com.

00:16.620 --> 00:21.840
Some days later, all, or at least almost all, of those 13 million orders arrive at their

00:21.840 --> 00:22.960
destination.

00:22.960 --> 00:26.040
But, what happens in between?

00:26.040 --> 00:29.000
How does Amazon get a package to you?

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Well, it depends—a lot.

00:32.000 --> 00:37.480
In fact, Amazon's fulfillment system, their shipping system, is more complicated and convoluted

00:37.480 --> 00:43.840
than that of almost any logistics company—it's far more complicated than that of UPS or FedEx

00:43.840 --> 00:47.360
or DHL or any other major delivery company.

00:47.360 --> 00:52.440
In a counterintuitive way, this complicated and convoluted fulfillment system is a crucial

00:52.440 --> 00:56.800
component of this secret sauce that's driving Amazon's success.

00:56.800 --> 01:02.240
They're striving to make the consumer experience simple through behind-the-scenes complexity.

01:02.240 --> 01:06.140
So, back to the question, how does an Amazon package get to you?

01:06.140 --> 01:07.200
And the answer?

01:07.200 --> 01:08.200
It depends.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.940
It depends first on who's fulfilling the package—Amazon or the seller.

01:12.940 --> 01:17.460
About one-fourth of sales in the US are fulfilled directly by the seller, as most products on

01:17.460 --> 01:21.960
Amazon are listed there by a third party, which can send packages directly through UPS,

01:21.960 --> 01:26.680
FedEx, the Postal Service, or another consumer delivery company if they choose.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.740
Amazon has nothing to do with the fulfillment of those orders, and the process looks largely

01:30.740 --> 01:33.680
the same as with any other e-commerce company.

01:33.680 --> 01:39.280
What's different is how the other three-quarters of Amazon packages in the US get to you—the

01:39.280 --> 01:42.000
ones that are fulfilled directly by Amazon.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.720
The path that these take depends first on how big the package is.

01:46.720 --> 01:52.160
You see, Amazon's fulfillment centers are more or less split into three categories—small

01:52.160 --> 01:55.600
sortable, large sortable, and large non-sortable.

01:55.600 --> 02:01.120
That first category, small sortable, represents the bread and butter of Amazon's business.

02:01.120 --> 02:06.560
These are items that are less than 12 by 16 by 6 inches or 30 by 40 by 15 centimeters

02:06.560 --> 02:10.780
in size, and about 25 pounds or 11 kilograms in weight.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.220
The next category, large sortable, is basically anything larger than this up to a weight of

02:15.220 --> 02:17.760
about 60 pounds or 27 kilograms.

02:17.760 --> 02:22.740
Now, the reasons for the split between large and small is because the fulfillment operations

02:22.740 --> 02:28.600
of smaller items is much easier to automate—they can fit on conveyor belts and automated robots

02:28.600 --> 02:32.140
and other tools that lower the company's reliance on humans.

02:32.140 --> 02:37.020
For example, Amazon uses a robot called the Kiva which fundamentally changed the way the

02:37.020 --> 02:42.060
job of the company's pickers—the people who find and grab an item out of storage—worked.

02:42.060 --> 02:47.540
Previously, pickers would walk some 10 to 12 miles or 16 to 19 kilometers a day through

02:47.540 --> 02:49.580
cavernous rows of shelves.

02:49.580 --> 02:54.980
Now, at least in their most advanced fulfillment centers, a robot picks up an entire mobile

02:54.980 --> 02:59.820
shelf on which a required product is located and transports it to the picker who picks

02:59.820 --> 03:00.820
it.

03:00.820 --> 03:05.580
Essentially, rather than the picker going to the shelf, the shelf goes to the picker.

03:05.580 --> 03:11.760
With these robots, one person can pick 300 to 400 items an hour rather than the 100 or

03:11.760 --> 03:13.780
so that was possible on foot.

03:13.780 --> 03:17.800
Of course, fewer humans in the mix is good for Amazon, given the amount of criticism

03:17.800 --> 03:22.360
it receives for its treatment of workers, and because humans, even low-paid ones, are

03:22.360 --> 03:23.700
expensive.

03:23.700 --> 03:28.160
The fulfillment process for larger items, though, is just tougher to automate cheaply,

03:28.160 --> 03:32.680
so the company chooses to segment the two processes out, and runs a far more manual

03:32.680 --> 03:35.840
and distinct fulfillment system for larger items.

03:35.840 --> 03:41.760
However, in most but not all cases, the fulfillment centers for large and small items are under

03:41.760 --> 03:45.560
the same roof, even if they're operated completely independently.

03:45.560 --> 03:49.760
Of course, the ideal scenario for Amazon would be to have every single item they sell

03:49.760 --> 03:53.360
in every single warehouse, but that's not realistic.

03:53.360 --> 03:58.560
Therefore, they use predictive modeling to try to put items closest to those who are

03:58.560 --> 04:00.200
likely to buy them.

04:00.200 --> 04:05.520
The US is far from homogeneous, so demand for different products varies from place to

04:05.520 --> 04:06.520
place.

04:06.520 --> 04:11.320
For example, in Miami, people probably aren't looking to buy many ice scrapers for their

04:11.320 --> 04:12.320
cars.

04:12.320 --> 04:17.200
Meanwhile, in Fargo, North Dakota, demand for this item is almost certainly quite high.

04:17.200 --> 04:22.000
It's therefore no wonder why that, if you look at the data, the colder the city, the

04:22.000 --> 04:25.400
faster you can get an ice scraper on Amazon.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.280
That is Amazon's predictive stocking at work.

04:28.280 --> 04:33.740
While most examples of this system are far more nuanced and far less intuitive, the concept

04:33.740 --> 04:37.620
is simple—their algorithms put products closest to the consumers most likely to buy

04:37.620 --> 04:42.720
them—something only possible at this scale thanks to modern big data analytics.

04:42.720 --> 04:48.620
Of course, there's then that third category of products—large non-sortable.

04:48.620 --> 04:52.820
The distinction here is because Amazon likes to aggregate products together into as few

04:52.820 --> 04:57.900
packages as possible—unsurprisingly, fewer packages equals lower costs.

04:57.900 --> 05:03.060
So, both these sortable categories include anything that could possibly be packaged together

05:03.060 --> 05:04.680
in a single box.

05:04.680 --> 05:10.460
The largest items, say a 70-pound beanbag, for example, are shipped from the large, non-sortable

05:10.460 --> 05:12.140
fulfillment centers.

05:12.140 --> 05:16.520
These facilities are even less automated than the large, sortable ones, and even include

05:16.520 --> 05:20.340
workers who create custom boxes for odd-sized items.

05:20.340 --> 05:25.420
In Colorado, for example, this is a completely separate facility, located in Aurora, from

05:25.420 --> 05:27.940
the sortable fulfillment center in Thornton.

05:27.940 --> 05:32.860
Now, some large items will go directly into the system of a third-party provider, typically

05:32.860 --> 05:37.800
XPL Logistics, which would deliver these bulky items to their final destination, while

05:37.800 --> 05:40.860
others will continue on in Amazon's system.

05:40.860 --> 05:45.980
The portion of large, non-sortable items not sent to a third-party logistics provider plus

05:45.980 --> 05:50.540
all the large and small sortable packages would next be sent to a regional sortation

05:50.540 --> 05:51.540
center.

05:51.540 --> 05:56.060
In Colorado, those two fulfillment centers send their packages to a single sortation

05:56.060 --> 06:00.380
center, located just minutes away from the Aurora fulfillment center.

06:00.380 --> 06:05.700
This is a massive facility, almost half a million square feet in size, with robots running

06:05.700 --> 06:10.380
around, dropping packages into different chutes, which each represent a different grouping

06:10.380 --> 06:11.500
of zip codes.

06:11.500 --> 06:18.020
Now, not all the sortation centers are quite so automated, but each outputs the same thing—pallets

06:18.020 --> 06:21.540
of packages going to roughly the same place.

06:21.540 --> 06:25.300
What happens next, though, once again, depends.

06:25.300 --> 06:29.720
A package heading to Miami, for example, would end up on a pallet with other packages for

06:29.760 --> 06:34.440
Miami, which itself would end up on a truck carrying pallets for Tampa, North Carolina,

06:34.440 --> 06:39.520
Houston, Baltimore, New York City, Connecticut, and a few other cities and states to the east.

06:39.520 --> 06:44.980
This truck would then drive the 15 minutes to a waiting 767 cargo plane at Denver International

06:44.980 --> 06:47.960
Airport, branded in Prime Air livery.

06:47.960 --> 06:54.640
Now, Amazon Air started in 2015 with its lease of about 20 aircraft from Air Transport International,

06:54.640 --> 06:59.200
and has since grown to almost 70 aircraft—all leased from other airlines.

06:59.200 --> 07:03.920
However, the company recently announced the purchase of their first 11 aircraft, also

07:03.920 --> 07:09.320
767, bought from Delta and WestJet, meaning they'll soon both own and operate their

07:09.320 --> 07:10.980
own aircraft.

07:10.980 --> 07:15.380
Those eastbound pallets would all be loaded around 4 AM, before the aircraft's scheduled

07:15.380 --> 07:17.880
departure time of 4.54 AM.

07:17.880 --> 07:23.740
Now, anyone familiar with UPS or FedEx's operations will know why this departure time

07:23.740 --> 07:25.120
is strange.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.480
If UPS was transporting this package to Miami, at least at its fastest speed, it would have

07:29.480 --> 07:34.260
departed on an aircraft the previous night at 9.40 PM, been flown to Louisville, sorted

07:34.260 --> 07:38.520
through the company's hub, then flown to Miami, arriving at 5.50 AM.

07:38.520 --> 07:41.560
FedEx would have done roughly the same, just through Memphis instead.

07:41.560 --> 07:46.540
That's because FedEx, UPS, and most other major delivery companies are oriented towards

07:46.540 --> 07:50.560
overnight delivery—they make a big chunk of their money charging big rates to take

07:50.560 --> 07:55.240
a package from one part of the US one day, and deliver it to another the next day.

07:55.240 --> 08:00.680
Amazon, meanwhile, built their prime brand off the promise of two-day delivery—ordering

08:00.680 --> 08:03.800
a package on a Monday and getting it on a Wednesday, for example.

08:03.800 --> 08:08.560
While they've sent straight from the rigidness of that system, the fastest shipping they'll

08:08.560 --> 08:13.340
offer for an item not stocked at a local fulfillment center is two days, meaning they don't have

08:13.340 --> 08:16.840
to worry about being able to get a package from Denver to Miami overnight.

08:17.320 --> 08:21.760
That's why UPS and FedEx's planes take off in the evening, while Amazon's leave

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
in the morning.

08:22.760 --> 08:28.480
So, that means it's about 9 AM by the time that Amazon Airplane from Denver gets to Cincinnati

08:28.480 --> 08:30.500
Airport each day.

08:30.500 --> 08:35.120
Through the morning hours, a dozen or so aircraft land in Cincinnati, and this timing gives

08:35.120 --> 08:38.120
the company a major advantage.

08:38.120 --> 08:43.680
Cincinnati Airport is also home to DHL's main America's hub, but DHL, like FedEx

08:43.680 --> 08:49.040
and UPS, conducts its operations primarily overnight starting at around midnight, when

08:49.040 --> 08:53.400
dozens of their aircraft from around the world land and unload.

08:53.400 --> 08:58.360
Over the next few hours, packages and pallets are sorted and unloaded onto other aircraft,

08:58.360 --> 09:00.780
which all tend to take off by 8 AM.

09:00.780 --> 09:06.320
That means DHL only really uses their facility during the overnight hours, so Amazon leases

09:06.320 --> 09:08.360
it for daytime use.

09:08.360 --> 09:13.320
While Amazon is building their own, larger facility at Cincinnati Airport, this partnership

09:13.320 --> 09:15.760
gave them a huge head start.

09:15.760 --> 09:21.600
So, each day, between 8 AM and 4 PM, Amazon's there, turning their planes around, and sorting

09:21.600 --> 09:26.400
pallets from where they come from, like Denver, to where they need to go, like Miami.

09:26.400 --> 09:31.340
That Miami flight takes off each weekday at 2.15 PM, and then it lands in Florida just

09:31.340 --> 09:33.880
before 5 PM Eastern Time.

09:33.880 --> 09:38.520
Now, not every Amazon Air itinerary looks like this.

09:38.520 --> 09:42.860
In fact, while UPS and FedEx route almost all of their flights through their Louisville

09:42.900 --> 09:47.140
and Memphis super hubs, or through some of their secondary hubs across the country, only

09:47.140 --> 09:51.540
20% of Amazon Air's flights go through their main Cincinnati hub.

09:51.540 --> 09:56.940
That's because, with their orientation towards two-day delivery versus one, they just have

09:56.940 --> 09:58.660
more time.

09:58.660 --> 10:03.300
The more time means that, in order to service the entirety of Florida, Amazon only needs

10:03.300 --> 10:07.620
to fly to three destinations—Miami, Tampa, and Lakeland.

10:07.620 --> 10:12.380
That's because Amazon's flights to these airports typically land by 5 PM, meaning there's

10:12.900 --> 10:18.580
12 hours before packages have to be at the local delivery center for the final destination.

10:18.580 --> 10:23.500
The entirety of Florida is within an eight-hour drive of Lakeland, meaning Amazon can deliver

10:23.500 --> 10:29.300
to all of Florida by only serving effectively one, but in practice three, airports.

10:29.300 --> 10:34.540
Meanwhile, FedEx, for example, flies from Memphis to Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville,

10:34.540 --> 10:38.720
Tallahassee, Tampa, and Palm Beach, then from Fort Lauderdale it operates feeder flights

10:38.720 --> 10:41.460
on smaller aircraft to Key West and Marathon.

10:41.540 --> 10:47.940
So, in summary, in order to serve all of Florida, this is what FedEx has to do, and this is

10:47.940 --> 10:49.900
what Amazon has to do.

10:49.900 --> 10:54.900
The required number of destinations for full coverage is greatly reduced by orienting for

10:54.900 --> 10:59.260
two-day delivery, and this also means that Amazon doesn't have to route every flight

10:59.260 --> 11:01.660
via one main hub.

11:01.660 --> 11:06.660
Because they operate to far fewer destinations, it's much easier for Amazon to fill a plane

11:06.660 --> 11:11.180
from California, for example, exclusively with packages destined for Florida, since

11:11.180 --> 11:16.340
while a given UPS or FedEx flight carries packages from or to just one city, a given

11:16.340 --> 11:21.900
Amazon Air flight likely carries packages from or to a whole state or region.

11:21.900 --> 11:27.260
Therefore, Amazon Air has flights from all these airports to Lakeland, meaning that,

11:27.260 --> 11:31.340
while a package from Denver would have to route via Cincinnati, one from Los Angeles

11:31.340 --> 11:35.220
or Dallas or Chicago could fly direct.

11:35.220 --> 11:39.600
With a full hub-and-spoke strategy, like that of UPS or FedEx, a package would have

11:39.600 --> 11:45.020
to be loaded and unloaded from aircraft twice, and sometimes more, while Amazon Air's non-stop

11:45.020 --> 11:50.140
flights only require loading and unloading once, which reduces cost, and can fly packages

11:50.140 --> 11:52.780
direct, which also reduces cost.

11:52.780 --> 11:58.700
This is how Amazon can transport packages by air more efficiently than UPS or FedEx.

11:58.700 --> 12:03.900
The airplane, however, is just one of five routes that an Amazon package could take onwards

12:03.900 --> 12:06.300
from the Denver Sortation Center.

12:06.300 --> 12:10.240
For those that are to be delivered locally, in the Denver area, they'll be driven to

12:10.240 --> 12:12.780
one of four delivery stations for Denver.

12:12.780 --> 12:17.280
There, they'll be loaded into smaller delivery vans, operated by independent companies or

12:17.280 --> 12:22.580
individuals contracted by Amazon, which will take the packages to their final destinations.

12:22.580 --> 12:27.760
This is the one and only case in which an Amazon package is handled by Amazon Logistics

12:27.760 --> 12:31.820
from start to finish, and it's generally how their packages are delivered within major

12:31.820 --> 12:34.220
urban and suburban areas.

12:34.220 --> 12:38.600
Only a slim majority of their overall package volume is delivered this way, though, as when

12:38.600 --> 12:43.260
you leave major urban areas, things get a bit more complicated.

12:43.260 --> 12:48.460
Now, a package heading outside the Denver area with a later delivery date, or with a

12:48.460 --> 12:53.980
destination within the greater Rockies region, would end up on an Amazon-branded but independently

12:53.980 --> 12:55.940
operated semi-truck.

12:55.940 --> 13:01.360
For example, packages to the Aspen area, about a three to four hour drive into the mountains,

13:01.360 --> 13:03.600
arrive at around 1 AM each night.

13:03.600 --> 13:08.000
Early in the morning, however, at around 5 AM, they arrive at the local post office and

13:08.000 --> 13:12.320
from there, they're fully transferred into the United States Postal Service system for

13:12.320 --> 13:13.940
final delivery.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.300
You see, in less populous areas, like the mountains of Colorado, it just doesn't make

13:18.300 --> 13:21.720
sense for Amazon to operate their own last-mile delivery.

13:21.720 --> 13:26.280
They need a certain amount of scale for that to be cheaper than the alternative, and at

13:26.280 --> 13:30.520
least right now, that scale is only possible in major metro areas.

13:30.520 --> 13:36.340
Therefore, they need alternatives for smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and that alternative

13:36.340 --> 13:38.560
is more often than not the USPS.

13:38.560 --> 13:43.520
That's because the Postal Service charges very low rates for last-mile delivery, assuming

13:43.520 --> 13:47.720
Amazon transports the packages to the local post offices themselves.

13:47.720 --> 13:53.060
While exact numbers aren't publicly known, estimates indicate the USPS charges Amazon

13:53.060 --> 13:58.280
about $2 per package for last-mile delivery—about half of what other delivery companies would

13:58.280 --> 14:00.160
for the same service.

14:00.160 --> 14:05.720
After all, the USPS services every address in America, so wherever Amazon needs to deliver,

14:05.720 --> 14:08.080
the USPS is going there anyways.

14:08.080 --> 14:13.600
That's why, for smaller places that still have a decent volume of packages, like mid-sized

14:13.600 --> 14:19.160
towns and cities, USPS delivery is often the cheapest option for Amazon.

14:19.160 --> 14:25.560
But then, there's that next step down—the most rural places in America.

14:25.560 --> 14:30.040
Anything that can't be cheaply delivered by Amazon or the USPS, typically because they're

14:30.040 --> 14:34.020
destined for low-density areas where you couldn't even fill a truck to send to the local post

14:34.020 --> 14:39.080
office, or because of capacity or speed reasons, is sent through UPS.

14:39.080 --> 14:43.680
Right now, it's believed that about 20% of Amazon's packages end up delivered by

14:43.680 --> 14:44.680
UPS.

14:44.680 --> 14:49.340
In Colorado, a package destined for the most rural areas, like the western edge of San

14:49.340 --> 14:52.920
Miguel County, for example, would take this route.

14:52.920 --> 14:56.560
It would cost Amazon far more, and they'd likely end up losing money on the cheapest

14:56.560 --> 15:00.960
items, but it's what's required for them to be able to service every address in the

15:00.960 --> 15:02.900
US quickly.

15:02.900 --> 15:07.540
No matter which of these routes a package takes, the end result is, at least hopefully,

15:07.540 --> 15:08.540
the same.

15:08.540 --> 15:13.760
UPS, the USPS, or Amazon itself drops off a package at its final destinations after

15:13.760 --> 15:16.000
a few days of travel across the US.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.560
It's a very simple process from a consumer perspective, but the behind-the-scenes is

15:21.560 --> 15:23.360
incredibly complex.

15:23.360 --> 15:28.080
The complexity is what's needed, though, for a business whose whole value proposition

15:28.080 --> 15:31.740
is to get anything to your door quickly and cheaply.

15:31.740 --> 15:38.140
The core of Amazon—their competitive advantage—is now logistics, to the point where many experts

15:38.140 --> 15:42.520
believe that the company will start offering delivery as a service to other companies in

15:42.520 --> 15:43.520
the coming years.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.840
They believe that they've perfected their system enough that they're going to take

15:46.840 --> 15:49.460
on UPS and FedEx.

15:49.460 --> 15:54.060
Of course, Amazon still has competitors, which are going after the company as aggressively

15:54.060 --> 15:55.060
as ever.

15:55.060 --> 16:00.040
Target, for example, has been able to build a delivery system with similar speed through

16:00.040 --> 16:03.500
completely different means—ones that are far simpler.

16:03.500 --> 16:08.440
They've essentially turned each of their 1,900 stores across every US state into a

16:08.440 --> 16:14.360
fulfillment center—they send employees out into the aisles who pick, pack, and ship online

16:14.360 --> 16:15.560
orders.

16:15.560 --> 16:19.800
That means that their packages never have to travel very far at all, and so they can

16:19.800 --> 16:25.040
take advantage of cheap and quick ground shipping from UPS, FedEx, and other more traditional

16:25.040 --> 16:26.200
providers.

16:26.200 --> 16:31.160
Some 80% of the company's orders are fulfilled directly from its stores, and now Walmart

16:31.160 --> 16:35.680
is also adapting this direct-from-store fulfillment system as well.

16:35.680 --> 16:40.380
So far, though, Amazon believes in their system of simplicity through complexity, and they're

16:40.380 --> 16:44.640
making moves to further expand the system within the US, and emulate it in Europe, where

16:44.640 --> 16:48.680
they recently opened their first airhub in Leipzig and put their first two freight aircraft

16:48.680 --> 16:50.560
online in November 2020.

16:50.560 --> 16:56.600
UPS, FedEx, and the other major consumer delivery companies are already well aware of just how

16:56.600 --> 16:59.500
big a threat Amazon poses to them.

16:59.500 --> 17:04.540
Amazon has managed to build a 21st century logistics network using 21st century techniques

17:04.540 --> 17:08.840
and technologies, and, of course, part of the threat comes from the company's market

17:08.840 --> 17:14.500
dominance, but most is because Amazon is innovating in a way others aren't.

17:14.500 --> 17:20.060
The way FedEx and UPS moved packages today is largely the same way they did decades ago,

17:20.060 --> 17:24.560
but Amazon's system is only possible through innovations that allow them to manage such

17:24.560 --> 17:28.040
a massive, complex, and convoluted system.

17:28.040 --> 17:32.680
This is all to say, if you're worried about Amazon's growing position as the one-stop

17:32.680 --> 17:39.020
shop for the world, be worried, because they're only getting better at it.

17:39.020 --> 17:43.840
What Amazon's rise proves more than anything is that, like it or not, online is the new

17:43.840 --> 17:45.000
Main Street.

17:45.000 --> 17:49.700
Therefore, just as you'd be concerned with what your storefront looks like on Main Street,

17:49.700 --> 17:52.840
you should be concerned about how your web presence looks.

17:52.840 --> 17:58.360
Now, in the case of email, having a non-custom address is the equivalent of having a dirty

17:58.360 --> 18:00.920
sign—it works, but it's not pretty.

18:00.920 --> 18:05.760
That's why you'll notice that most professionals use custom email addresses—something that

18:05.760 --> 18:07.840
ends in something like "@wendover.productions."

18:07.840 --> 18:13.400
That's a domain that I bought through Hover, made possible thanks to their over 400 unique

18:13.400 --> 18:18.240
domain extensions that let you go way beyond .com, .org, or .net.

18:18.240 --> 18:22.000
After getting that domain, it took about two minutes to set up a custom email address for

18:22.000 --> 18:24.640
myself and everyone else who works on the channel.

18:24.640 --> 18:29.240
I can't count the number of times when someone has complimented our email address, as weird

18:29.240 --> 18:33.760
as that sounds, and so whether you run a business, or just want a better email for yourself,

18:33.760 --> 18:36.720
it's worth getting a custom one with Hover.

18:36.720 --> 18:41.920
So, head to hover.com slash wendover to get 10% off your first purchase of a custom domain

18:41.920 --> 18:45.920
or email address, and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
