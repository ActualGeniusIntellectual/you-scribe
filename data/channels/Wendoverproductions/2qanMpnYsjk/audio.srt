3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,620
About 13 million times per day, someone clicks the order button on Amazon.com.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,840
Some days later, all, or at least almost all, of those 13 million orders arrive at their

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,960
destination.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,040
But, what happens in between?

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,000
How does Amazon get a package to you?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, it depends—a lot.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,480
In fact, Amazon's fulfillment system, their shipping system, is more complicated and convoluted

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,840
than that of almost any logistics company—it's far more complicated than that of UPS or FedEx

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
or DHL or any other major delivery company.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,440
In a counterintuitive way, this complicated and convoluted fulfillment system is a crucial

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,800
component of this secret sauce that's driving Amazon's success.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,240
They're striving to make the consumer experience simple through behind-the-scenes complexity.

15
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,140
So, back to the question, how does an Amazon package get to you?

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,200
And the answer?

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
It depends.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,940
It depends first on who's fulfilling the package—Amazon or the seller.

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:17,460
About one-fourth of sales in the US are fulfilled directly by the seller, as most products on

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,960
Amazon are listed there by a third party, which can send packages directly through UPS,

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,680
FedEx, the Postal Service, or another consumer delivery company if they choose.

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,740
Amazon has nothing to do with the fulfillment of those orders, and the process looks largely

23
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,680
the same as with any other e-commerce company.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,280
What's different is how the other three-quarters of Amazon packages in the US get to you—the

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,000
ones that are fulfilled directly by Amazon.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,720
The path that these take depends first on how big the package is.

27
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,160
You see, Amazon's fulfillment centers are more or less split into three categories—small

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,600
sortable, large sortable, and large non-sortable.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,120
That first category, small sortable, represents the bread and butter of Amazon's business.

30
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,560
These are items that are less than 12 by 16 by 6 inches or 30 by 40 by 15 centimeters

31
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,780
in size, and about 25 pounds or 11 kilograms in weight.

32
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,220
The next category, large sortable, is basically anything larger than this up to a weight of

33
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,760
about 60 pounds or 27 kilograms.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,740
Now, the reasons for the split between large and small is because the fulfillment operations

35
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,600
of smaller items is much easier to automate—they can fit on conveyor belts and automated robots

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,140
and other tools that lower the company's reliance on humans.

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:37,020
For example, Amazon uses a robot called the Kiva which fundamentally changed the way the

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,060
job of the company's pickers—the people who find and grab an item out of storage—worked.

39
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,540
Previously, pickers would walk some 10 to 12 miles or 16 to 19 kilometers a day through

40
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,580
cavernous rows of shelves.

41
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,980
Now, at least in their most advanced fulfillment centers, a robot picks up an entire mobile

42
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,820
shelf on which a required product is located and transports it to the picker who picks

43
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,820
it.

44
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,580
Essentially, rather than the picker going to the shelf, the shelf goes to the picker.

45
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,760
With these robots, one person can pick 300 to 400 items an hour rather than the 100 or

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,780
so that was possible on foot.

47
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,800
Of course, fewer humans in the mix is good for Amazon, given the amount of criticism

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,360
it receives for its treatment of workers, and because humans, even low-paid ones, are

49
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,700
expensive.

50
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,160
The fulfillment process for larger items, though, is just tougher to automate cheaply,

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,680
so the company chooses to segment the two processes out, and runs a far more manual

52
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,840
and distinct fulfillment system for larger items.

53
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,760
However, in most but not all cases, the fulfillment centers for large and small items are under

54
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,560
the same roof, even if they're operated completely independently.

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,760
Of course, the ideal scenario for Amazon would be to have every single item they sell

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,360
in every single warehouse, but that's not realistic.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,560
Therefore, they use predictive modeling to try to put items closest to those who are

58
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,200
likely to buy them.

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,520
The US is far from homogeneous, so demand for different products varies from place to

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
place.

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,320
For example, in Miami, people probably aren't looking to buy many ice scrapers for their

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
cars.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,200
Meanwhile, in Fargo, North Dakota, demand for this item is almost certainly quite high.

64
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,000
It's therefore no wonder why that, if you look at the data, the colder the city, the

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
faster you can get an ice scraper on Amazon.

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,280
That is Amazon's predictive stocking at work.

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,740
While most examples of this system are far more nuanced and far less intuitive, the concept

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,620
is simple—their algorithms put products closest to the consumers most likely to buy

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,720
them—something only possible at this scale thanks to modern big data analytics.

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,620
Of course, there's then that third category of products—large non-sortable.

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,820
The distinction here is because Amazon likes to aggregate products together into as few

72
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,900
packages as possible—unsurprisingly, fewer packages equals lower costs.

73
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,060
So, both these sortable categories include anything that could possibly be packaged together

74
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,680
in a single box.

75
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,460
The largest items, say a 70-pound beanbag, for example, are shipped from the large, non-sortable

76
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,140
fulfillment centers.

77
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,520
These facilities are even less automated than the large, sortable ones, and even include

78
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,340
workers who create custom boxes for odd-sized items.

79
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,420
In Colorado, for example, this is a completely separate facility, located in Aurora, from

80
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,940
the sortable fulfillment center in Thornton.

81
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,860
Now, some large items will go directly into the system of a third-party provider, typically

82
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,800
XPL Logistics, which would deliver these bulky items to their final destination, while

83
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,860
others will continue on in Amazon's system.

84
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,980
The portion of large, non-sortable items not sent to a third-party logistics provider plus

85
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:50,540
all the large and small sortable packages would next be sent to a regional sortation

86
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
center.

87
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,060
In Colorado, those two fulfillment centers send their packages to a single sortation

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,380
center, located just minutes away from the Aurora fulfillment center.

89
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:05,700
This is a massive facility, almost half a million square feet in size, with robots running

90
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:10,380
around, dropping packages into different chutes, which each represent a different grouping

91
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,500
of zip codes.

92
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,020
Now, not all the sortation centers are quite so automated, but each outputs the same thing—pallets

93
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,540
of packages going to roughly the same place.

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,300
What happens next, though, once again, depends.

95
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,720
A package heading to Miami, for example, would end up on a pallet with other packages for

96
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,440
Miami, which itself would end up on a truck carrying pallets for Tampa, North Carolina,

97
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,520
Houston, Baltimore, New York City, Connecticut, and a few other cities and states to the east.

98
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,980
This truck would then drive the 15 minutes to a waiting 767 cargo plane at Denver International

99
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,960
Airport, branded in Prime Air livery.

100
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Now, Amazon Air started in 2015 with its lease of about 20 aircraft from Air Transport International,

101
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,200
and has since grown to almost 70 aircraft—all leased from other airlines.

102
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,920
However, the company recently announced the purchase of their first 11 aircraft, also

103
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,320
767, bought from Delta and WestJet, meaning they'll soon both own and operate their

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,980
own aircraft.

105
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,380
Those eastbound pallets would all be loaded around 4 AM, before the aircraft's scheduled

106
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,880
departure time of 4.54 AM.

107
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,740
Now, anyone familiar with UPS or FedEx's operations will know why this departure time

108
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,120
is strange.

109
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,480
If UPS was transporting this package to Miami, at least at its fastest speed, it would have

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,260
departed on an aircraft the previous night at 9.40 PM, been flown to Louisville, sorted

111
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,520
through the company's hub, then flown to Miami, arriving at 5.50 AM.

112
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,560
FedEx would have done roughly the same, just through Memphis instead.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,540
That's because FedEx, UPS, and most other major delivery companies are oriented towards

114
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,560
overnight delivery—they make a big chunk of their money charging big rates to take

115
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,240
a package from one part of the US one day, and deliver it to another the next day.

116
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,680
Amazon, meanwhile, built their prime brand off the promise of two-day delivery—ordering

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,800
a package on a Monday and getting it on a Wednesday, for example.

118
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,560
While they've sent straight from the rigidness of that system, the fastest shipping they'll

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,340
offer for an item not stocked at a local fulfillment center is two days, meaning they don't have

120
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,840
to worry about being able to get a package from Denver to Miami overnight.

121
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,760
That's why UPS and FedEx's planes take off in the evening, while Amazon's leave

122
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
in the morning.

123
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,480
So, that means it's about 9 AM by the time that Amazon Airplane from Denver gets to Cincinnati

124
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,500
Airport each day.

125
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:35,120
Through the morning hours, a dozen or so aircraft land in Cincinnati, and this timing gives

126
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
the company a major advantage.

127
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,680
Cincinnati Airport is also home to DHL's main America's hub, but DHL, like FedEx

128
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,040
and UPS, conducts its operations primarily overnight starting at around midnight, when

129
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,400
dozens of their aircraft from around the world land and unload.

130
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,360
Over the next few hours, packages and pallets are sorted and unloaded onto other aircraft,

131
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,780
which all tend to take off by 8 AM.

132
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,320
That means DHL only really uses their facility during the overnight hours, so Amazon leases

133
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,360
it for daytime use.

134
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,320
While Amazon is building their own, larger facility at Cincinnati Airport, this partnership

135
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,760
gave them a huge head start.

136
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,600
So, each day, between 8 AM and 4 PM, Amazon's there, turning their planes around, and sorting

137
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,400
pallets from where they come from, like Denver, to where they need to go, like Miami.

138
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,340
That Miami flight takes off each weekday at 2.15 PM, and then it lands in Florida just

139
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,880
before 5 PM Eastern Time.

140
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,520
Now, not every Amazon Air itinerary looks like this.

141
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,860
In fact, while UPS and FedEx route almost all of their flights through their Louisville

142
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,140
and Memphis super hubs, or through some of their secondary hubs across the country, only

143
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,540
20% of Amazon Air's flights go through their main Cincinnati hub.

144
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,940
That's because, with their orientation towards two-day delivery versus one, they just have

145
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,660
more time.

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,300
The more time means that, in order to service the entirety of Florida, Amazon only needs

147
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,620
to fly to three destinations—Miami, Tampa, and Lakeland.

148
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,380
That's because Amazon's flights to these airports typically land by 5 PM, meaning there's

149
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,580
12 hours before packages have to be at the local delivery center for the final destination.

150
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:23,500
The entirety of Florida is within an eight-hour drive of Lakeland, meaning Amazon can deliver

151
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,300
to all of Florida by only serving effectively one, but in practice three, airports.

152
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:34,540
Meanwhile, FedEx, for example, flies from Memphis to Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Jacksonville,

153
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,720
Tallahassee, Tampa, and Palm Beach, then from Fort Lauderdale it operates feeder flights

154
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,460
on smaller aircraft to Key West and Marathon.

155
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,940
So, in summary, in order to serve all of Florida, this is what FedEx has to do, and this is

156
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,900
what Amazon has to do.

157
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,900
The required number of destinations for full coverage is greatly reduced by orienting for

158
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,260
two-day delivery, and this also means that Amazon doesn't have to route every flight

159
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,660
via one main hub.

160
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Because they operate to far fewer destinations, it's much easier for Amazon to fill a plane

161
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,180
from California, for example, exclusively with packages destined for Florida, since

162
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,340
while a given UPS or FedEx flight carries packages from or to just one city, a given

163
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:21,900
Amazon Air flight likely carries packages from or to a whole state or region.

164
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,260
Therefore, Amazon Air has flights from all these airports to Lakeland, meaning that,

165
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,340
while a package from Denver would have to route via Cincinnati, one from Los Angeles

166
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,220
or Dallas or Chicago could fly direct.

167
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,600
With a full hub-and-spoke strategy, like that of UPS or FedEx, a package would have

168
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,020
to be loaded and unloaded from aircraft twice, and sometimes more, while Amazon Air's non-stop

169
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:50,140
flights only require loading and unloading once, which reduces cost, and can fly packages

170
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,780
direct, which also reduces cost.

171
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:58,700
This is how Amazon can transport packages by air more efficiently than UPS or FedEx.

172
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,900
The airplane, however, is just one of five routes that an Amazon package could take onwards

173
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
from the Denver Sortation Center.

174
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,240
For those that are to be delivered locally, in the Denver area, they'll be driven to

175
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,780
one of four delivery stations for Denver.

176
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,280
There, they'll be loaded into smaller delivery vans, operated by independent companies or

177
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,580
individuals contracted by Amazon, which will take the packages to their final destinations.

178
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,760
This is the one and only case in which an Amazon package is handled by Amazon Logistics

179
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,820
from start to finish, and it's generally how their packages are delivered within major

180
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,220
urban and suburban areas.

181
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,600
Only a slim majority of their overall package volume is delivered this way, though, as when

182
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,260
you leave major urban areas, things get a bit more complicated.

183
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,460
Now, a package heading outside the Denver area with a later delivery date, or with a

184
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,980
destination within the greater Rockies region, would end up on an Amazon-branded but independently

185
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,940
operated semi-truck.

186
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:01,360
For example, packages to the Aspen area, about a three to four hour drive into the mountains,

187
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
arrive at around 1 AM each night.

188
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,000
Early in the morning, however, at around 5 AM, they arrive at the local post office and

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,320
from there, they're fully transferred into the United States Postal Service system for

190
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,940
final delivery.

191
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,300
You see, in less populous areas, like the mountains of Colorado, it just doesn't make

192
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,720
sense for Amazon to operate their own last-mile delivery.

193
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,280
They need a certain amount of scale for that to be cheaper than the alternative, and at

194
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:30,520
least right now, that scale is only possible in major metro areas.

195
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:36,340
Therefore, they need alternatives for smaller cities, towns, and rural areas, and that alternative

196
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,560
is more often than not the USPS.

197
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,520
That's because the Postal Service charges very low rates for last-mile delivery, assuming

198
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,720
Amazon transports the packages to the local post offices themselves.

199
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,060
While exact numbers aren't publicly known, estimates indicate the USPS charges Amazon

200
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,280
about $2 per package for last-mile delivery—about half of what other delivery companies would

201
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,160
for the same service.

202
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,720
After all, the USPS services every address in America, so wherever Amazon needs to deliver,

203
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,080
the USPS is going there anyways.

204
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,600
That's why, for smaller places that still have a decent volume of packages, like mid-sized

205
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,160
towns and cities, USPS delivery is often the cheapest option for Amazon.

206
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:25,560
But then, there's that next step down—the most rural places in America.

207
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,040
Anything that can't be cheaply delivered by Amazon or the USPS, typically because they're

208
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,020
destined for low-density areas where you couldn't even fill a truck to send to the local post

209
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:39,080
office, or because of capacity or speed reasons, is sent through UPS.

210
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,680
Right now, it's believed that about 20% of Amazon's packages end up delivered by

211
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,680
UPS.

212
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,340
In Colorado, a package destined for the most rural areas, like the western edge of San

213
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,920
Miguel County, for example, would take this route.

214
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,560
It would cost Amazon far more, and they'd likely end up losing money on the cheapest

215
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,960
items, but it's what's required for them to be able to service every address in the

216
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,900
US quickly.

217
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,540
No matter which of these routes a package takes, the end result is, at least hopefully,

218
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
the same.

219
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,760
UPS, the USPS, or Amazon itself drops off a package at its final destinations after

220
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
a few days of travel across the US.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,560
It's a very simple process from a consumer perspective, but the behind-the-scenes is

222
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,360
incredibly complex.

223
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,080
The complexity is what's needed, though, for a business whose whole value proposition

224
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,740
is to get anything to your door quickly and cheaply.

225
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:38,140
The core of Amazon—their competitive advantage—is now logistics, to the point where many experts

226
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,520
believe that the company will start offering delivery as a service to other companies in

227
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
the coming years.

228
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,840
They believe that they've perfected their system enough that they're going to take

229
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,460
on UPS and FedEx.

230
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,060
Of course, Amazon still has competitors, which are going after the company as aggressively

231
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
as ever.

232
00:15:55,060 --> 00:16:00,040
Target, for example, has been able to build a delivery system with similar speed through

233
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,500
completely different means—ones that are far simpler.

234
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,440
They've essentially turned each of their 1,900 stores across every US state into a

235
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:14,360
fulfillment center—they send employees out into the aisles who pick, pack, and ship online

236
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,560
orders.

237
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,800
That means that their packages never have to travel very far at all, and so they can

238
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,040
take advantage of cheap and quick ground shipping from UPS, FedEx, and other more traditional

239
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,200
providers.

240
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,160
Some 80% of the company's orders are fulfilled directly from its stores, and now Walmart

241
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,680
is also adapting this direct-from-store fulfillment system as well.

242
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,380
So far, though, Amazon believes in their system of simplicity through complexity, and they're

243
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:44,640
making moves to further expand the system within the US, and emulate it in Europe, where

244
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,680
they recently opened their first airhub in Leipzig and put their first two freight aircraft

245
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,560
online in November 2020.

246
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,600
UPS, FedEx, and the other major consumer delivery companies are already well aware of just how

247
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,500
big a threat Amazon poses to them.

248
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,540
Amazon has managed to build a 21st century logistics network using 21st century techniques

249
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,840
and technologies, and, of course, part of the threat comes from the company's market

250
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:14,500
dominance, but most is because Amazon is innovating in a way others aren't.

251
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,060
The way FedEx and UPS moved packages today is largely the same way they did decades ago,

252
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,560
but Amazon's system is only possible through innovations that allow them to manage such

253
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,040
a massive, complex, and convoluted system.

254
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:32,680
This is all to say, if you're worried about Amazon's growing position as the one-stop

255
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,020
shop for the world, be worried, because they're only getting better at it.

256
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,840
What Amazon's rise proves more than anything is that, like it or not, online is the new

257
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,000
Main Street.

258
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,700
Therefore, just as you'd be concerned with what your storefront looks like on Main Street,

259
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,840
you should be concerned about how your web presence looks.

260
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:58,360
Now, in the case of email, having a non-custom address is the equivalent of having a dirty

261
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,920
sign—it works, but it's not pretty.

262
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,760
That's why you'll notice that most professionals use custom email addresses—something that

263
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
ends in something like "@wendover.productions."

264
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,400
That's a domain that I bought through Hover, made possible thanks to their over 400 unique

265
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,240
domain extensions that let you go way beyond .com, .org, or .net.

266
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,000
After getting that domain, it took about two minutes to set up a custom email address for

267
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,640
myself and everyone else who works on the channel.

268
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,240
I can't count the number of times when someone has complimented our email address, as weird

269
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,760
as that sounds, and so whether you run a business, or just want a better email for yourself,

270
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,720
it's worth getting a custom one with Hover.

271
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,920
So, head to hover.com slash wendover to get 10% off your first purchase of a custom domain

272
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,920
or email address, and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
