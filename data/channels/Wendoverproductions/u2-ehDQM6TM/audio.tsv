0	7680	This is a building, in a town, on an island, in a territory, in the South Pacific.
7680	13440	An ocean so vast that barely any planes transverse it, barely any ships sail through it, an area
13440	18440	so empty that when we talk about how many people live where we look now, we do not talk
18440	24000	in magnitudes of billions or even millions, we talk about the mere thousands of people
24000	27580	who live in this immense precinct of our world.
27580	34220	But in a territory, on an island, in a town, in these buildings live just 50 of them—50
34220	39820	people on an island where the only way in or out is on a boat that comes a few times
39820	40860	a year.
40860	45360	These people live hundreds of miles away from the closest other people, thousands of miles
45360	51140	away from the closest city, and 10,000 miles or 16,000 kilometers away from their country's
51140	52340	capital in London.
52740	58940	That's because this is Pitcairn Island—Britain's smallest, furthest, and most isolated overseas
58940	60140	territory.
60140	65340	These 50 people live a life so removed from those of Belfasters or Edinburghs or Cardiffians
65340	69520	or Londoners that believing that they're part of the same country is just as hard as
69520	72420	believing that Pitcairn itself even exists.
72420	77100	That's because to all rational minds Pitcairn shouldn't exist.
77100	81300	It just doesn't make sense for there to be an island of 50 people living in the UK
81300	84460	yet on the absolute extremity of earth.
84460	87540	That's why I sought to make sense of it.
87540	93300	In the first season of our new podcast, Extremities, I explore over six episodes why and how Pitcairn
93300	97940	exists—why people settled there, how it became part of the UK, why people still live
97940	101420	there, how they get there today, how they get food, how they make money, how their government
101420	105740	works, how they communicate, how they plan to continue existing, and much, much more.
105740	111200	You can find Extremities on all major podcasting apps at extremitiespodcast.com or links are
111200	112640	in the description.
112640	117140	This is just season one and in future seasons, we'll be exploring why and how other of
117140	119920	earth's most isolated settlements exist.
119920	124060	This is something I and others have been working on for a while so I do hope you give at least
124060	125540	episode one a listen.
125540	130100	I believe it's something any Wendover Productions viewer will enjoy so I can't wait to hear
130100	130880	what you think.
