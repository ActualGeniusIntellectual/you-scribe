00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
This is a building, in a town, on an island, in a territory, in the South Pacific.

00:07.680 --> 00:13.440
An ocean so vast that barely any planes transverse it, barely any ships sail through it, an area

00:13.440 --> 00:18.440
so empty that when we talk about how many people live where we look now, we do not talk

00:18.440 --> 00:24.000
in magnitudes of billions or even millions, we talk about the mere thousands of people

00:24.000 --> 00:27.580
who live in this immense precinct of our world.

00:27.580 --> 00:34.220
But in a territory, on an island, in a town, in these buildings live just 50 of them—50

00:34.220 --> 00:39.820
people on an island where the only way in or out is on a boat that comes a few times

00:39.820 --> 00:40.860
a year.

00:40.860 --> 00:45.360
These people live hundreds of miles away from the closest other people, thousands of miles

00:45.360 --> 00:51.140
away from the closest city, and 10,000 miles or 16,000 kilometers away from their country's

00:51.140 --> 00:52.340
capital in London.

00:52.740 --> 00:58.940
That's because this is Pitcairn Island—Britain's smallest, furthest, and most isolated overseas

00:58.940 --> 01:00.140
territory.

01:00.140 --> 01:05.340
These 50 people live a life so removed from those of Belfasters or Edinburghs or Cardiffians

01:05.340 --> 01:09.520
or Londoners that believing that they're part of the same country is just as hard as

01:09.520 --> 01:12.420
believing that Pitcairn itself even exists.

01:12.420 --> 01:17.100
That's because to all rational minds Pitcairn shouldn't exist.

01:17.100 --> 01:21.300
It just doesn't make sense for there to be an island of 50 people living in the UK

01:21.300 --> 01:24.460
yet on the absolute extremity of earth.

01:24.460 --> 01:27.540
That's why I sought to make sense of it.

01:27.540 --> 01:33.300
In the first season of our new podcast, Extremities, I explore over six episodes why and how Pitcairn

01:33.300 --> 01:37.940
exists—why people settled there, how it became part of the UK, why people still live

01:37.940 --> 01:41.420
there, how they get there today, how they get food, how they make money, how their government

01:41.420 --> 01:45.740
works, how they communicate, how they plan to continue existing, and much, much more.

01:45.740 --> 01:51.200
You can find Extremities on all major podcasting apps at extremitiespodcast.com or links are

01:51.200 --> 01:52.640
in the description.

01:52.640 --> 01:57.140
This is just season one and in future seasons, we'll be exploring why and how other of

01:57.140 --> 01:59.920
earth's most isolated settlements exist.

01:59.920 --> 02:04.060
This is something I and others have been working on for a while so I do hope you give at least

02:04.060 --> 02:05.540
episode one a listen.

02:05.540 --> 02:10.100
I believe it's something any Wendover Productions viewer will enjoy so I can't wait to hear

02:10.100 --> 02:10.880
what you think.
