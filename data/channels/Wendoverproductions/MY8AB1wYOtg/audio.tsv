0	5000	It just turned 1050pm on a warm September night, when the band returns to the USANA
5000	8860	amphitheater stage southwest of Salt Lake City for an encore.
8860	13100	Though they make it seem spontaneous, the move is, of course, planned, and the song
13100	15180	had, of course, already been picked.
15180	18740	It's the perfect send-off that will leave the crowd buzzing, and keep the band from
18740	22220	violating the venue's strict 11pm curfew.
22220	26420	But as the show ends and the audience makes its way to the exits, another meticulously
26420	31940	choreographed and time-sensitive show begins—one with far less fanfare.
31940	38480	The tour's next stop is Ball Arena, in Denver, 522 miles or 840 kilometers away, and that
38480	41980	concert starts in exactly 21 hours.
41980	46160	So now it's all hands on deck to get the band, their set, and their double-digit crew
46160	48300	to Colorado on time.
48300	52940	Really, this show, this process of getting the band and company from Salt Lake to Denver,
52940	56660	began a few hours ago when the tour manager headed into their backstage office along with
56660	60020	the venue's promoter carrying record of the night's box office receipts to hash
60020	64780	out the money splits from ticketed merch sales to utilities and even clean towel fees, before
64780	67020	coming to a final settlement.
67020	71460	While an unspectacular process of crossing t's and dotting i's, it's this step
71460	75940	that makes the tour possible, and really more than anything else, fuels the music economy
75940	76940	today.
76940	82180	The USANA amphitheater, after all, holds a maximum of 20,000 guests—that's 20,000
82180	85540	potential ticket sales of which the band will receive an already agreed upon split
85540	88900	somewhere in the ballpark of 85%.
88900	93100	Once the money's settled and the band's finished, though, all attention focuses on
93100	94100	the loadout.
94100	98980	To be playing venues like the USANA amphitheater and Ball Arena, the band has to be big, and
98980	101740	big bands tour with big staffs.
101740	105980	This group, like most touring groups of its size, is broken into three groups.
105980	110180	There's the A party, made up of the artists and their inner circle, the B party, made
110180	114760	up of the band, dancers, and backup vocalists, and the C party, or the crew, from guitar
114760	117020	techs to pyrotechnic specialists.
117020	121500	To maximize overall efficiency, and the comfort of some, each party's taking a slightly
121500	123300	different path to Denver.
123300	126700	For the A party, it's off the stage, and depending on timing, grabbing something to
126700	131100	eat or a shower, then heading straight north, in higher suburbans, to the Atlantic Aviation
131100	135140	FBO at Salt Lake City International Airport, where a chartered jet is waiting.
135140	140100	For the rest of the onstage talent, the turnaround is nearly just as quick.
140100	143900	There's background vocalists and additional band members load onto tour buses that, depending
143900	147980	on the configuration that the tour manager settled on months prior, can carry up to 12
147980	150980	people spread across two aisles of triple stacked bunks.
150980	154660	They're off the stage and out the door quick, but won't be seeing the other side of the
154660	156900	Rockies until they wake up the next morning.
156900	161300	For the C party, what they brought out and put together only hours earlier now needs
161300	165140	to be returned into their cases and rolled back into their trailers in a precisely efficient
165140	167700	order before they too hit the road.
167700	171680	Under the oversight of production and stage managers, guitar techs carefully pack up guitars
171680	174140	and riggers carefully dismantle the set.
174140	177500	With the turnaround being so sharp, roadies working on the tour are joined by a hired
177500	181600	set of local stagehands who help pack out everything from the band's audiovisual assets
181600	186140	to the tour manager's office onto the trailers backed up against backstage.
186140	190100	Once the venue's cleared, the C party, like the B party a couple hours ahead, jumps onto
190100	194960	tour buses headed east, where showers and clean towels await them at the arena.
195000	198680	And now the time crunch shifts from the crew to its drivers.
198680	203020	None of the truck or bus drivers saw the band's show in Utah.
203020	204280	They were sleeping.
204280	208200	In fact, not until the show's end did those who were driving the B party even check out
208200	209200	of their hotels.
209200	213300	And only after the show's conclusion did they begin their systems check, inspecting
213300	216040	tires and timing belts before warming up the bus.
216040	221800	They've waited until the very last minutes because their driving time is incredibly precious.
221800	225660	By law, they can only drive for ten hours before they take a required eight-hour rest
225660	229760	period, and with the electronic logging devices built into their dashboards and tracking the
229760	233640	bus' every move, there's simply no cheating the ten-hour limit.
233640	238040	Facing down 500-plus miles on the Rocky Mountain Range, Denver stretches the limits of what's
238040	242200	possible when adding in stops, morning rush hour traffic, and the potential of anything
242200	243340	unpredictable.
243340	246560	Move the bus too early, and the next night's concert might get stuck on the side of the
246560	249480	road short of the destination in Denver.
249480	254280	Now, to an outsider, the loadout process might look chaotic, and the pace of the tour may
254280	256900	seem unsustainable or unmanageable.
256900	262300	But though grueling and exhaustingly complicated, these massive nationwide tours function remarkably
262300	265220	smoothly considering the variety of variables.
265220	268920	And they have to—there's too much on the line for them not to.
268920	272120	This is where bands make their money, and this is where deadlines are their absolute
272120	275960	toughest—a band can't simply reschedule in the middle of a tour during the middle
275960	278000	of the busy summer season.
278000	283420	To make these tours run smoothly, then, their managers leave no stone unturned.
283420	287200	To minimize the chaos and limit potential mistakes, the band's tour began perhaps
287200	291720	a month or two prior on the west coast, and had been in the works for upwards of a year.
291720	295080	Knowing that dates fell quickly during the summer, their agent began negotiating fees
295080	298720	and revenue splits with interested venues in the fall or winter prior, passing back
298720	302760	and forth drafts of deal memos like these before ultimately coming to an agreement.
302760	306680	With the concert dates penciled in, and a spot to rehearse for a few days prior identified
306680	310600	somewhere in Southern California, the tour manager then sent their dates along to truck
310600	314760	and bus leasing companies to go back and forth on price and configuration that best matched
314760	315760	the band's needs.
315760	320140	And with the venues locked, stage managers and production managers began assembling advance
320140	324920	sheets that outline every last technical detail about the venue, from bus and trailer parking
324920	329280	to office space and AV capabilities and hookups that the tour could possibly need to know
329280	330280	beforehand.
330280	335800	Months ago, the tour manager also sent along a rider to each of the touring party's hotels—essentially,
335800	339960	a sheet of requirements that spans from ensuring late checkout or day rooms to asking about
339960	342700	whether or not there's any construction happening nearby.
342700	346240	If meals are to be eaten at the hotel, dietary restrictions are communicated through this
346240	351920	document, as are allergies or ETAs or even how room keys should be packaged and distributed.
351920	355280	If the crew has an off day, it's important to find out what the bus parking nearby looks
355280	357400	like and what's nearby for the crew to do.
357400	361700	And if the band's famous enough, a likely scenario given the size of this tour, a rider
361700	366360	will inform the hotel that access to backdoors and service elevators will be required.
366360	370840	These documents often run pages long and aren't exclusive to hotels either, as tour managers
370840	375180	will send ahead riders for the venue's backstage setup, from food to layout, as well as a technical
375180	378820	rider spelling out the AV and rigging needs the show requires.
378820	382740	Though sent to each hotel and venue long in advance, these riders are dynamic documents
382740	386940	that change and evolve along with the tour, so managers will update and resend riders
386940	389220	weeks and even days before their arrival.
389620	392740	While the artists would have arrived at Centennial Airport in the early hours of the morning
392740	397640	and quickly transfer to their hotel, the rest of the tour's day begins around 9 AM, laying
397640	401940	in their bunks as their bus comes to a rest beside the loading dock of Denver's Ball
401940	402940	Arena.
402940	406180	Upon completing the eight hour drive through Wyoming, the driver hooks the bus up to a
406180	411420	provided 240-volt connection to deliver power without idling the engine, and joins the tour's
411420	414580	other bus and truck drivers for the short walk across the street to the Spring Hill
414580	418340	Suites Hotel, where day rooms are booked, to get their legally required rest before
418460	421060	driving onward after the concert that night.
421060	425220	The above-average eight hour drive makes this day a particular challenge—everything must
425220	428480	run perfectly to get the show built on time.
428480	432300	The first people into the building are the tour's leadership—the production manager,
432300	436460	production coordinator, head of security, lead rigger, and potentially others.
436460	439840	Their first stop is the catering room, where a local company set up breakfast over the
439840	441020	hours prior.
441020	445060	Next, the team meets with the venue's management to conduct a walkthrough and plan out the
445060	446060	day's activities.
446500	449580	They then work their way through the backstage, posting this day sheet throughout to give
449580	453380	a rundown of key moments through the day, and also labeling different rooms for different
453380	454380	purposes.
454380	457360	They'd need a production office, where the management would set up their desks, dressing
457360	461020	rooms for both the lead artists and their supporting acts, a storage room for empty
461020	464860	road cases and extra equipment, a wardrobe room for the costume department to get their
464860	468980	work done, and more depending on the size and scope of the tour.
468980	472620	In addition, they put up maps and directions for these different temporary rooms and key
472620	476380	permanent spots like the venue's shower rooms, given that nearly everyone lives out
476380	477820	of the tour bus.
477820	481920	Nobody should need to know where they are—in fact, through the fatigue, many of the tour's
481920	484740	members might genuinely forget.
484740	488660	Also early in the order of operations is making the final decision on the placement of the
488660	489660	stage.
489660	494060	In North America, most large concerts occur in indoor arenas otherwise occupied by NHL
494060	499200	and NBA hockey and basketball teams, as is the case with Denver's ball arena.
499200	503800	Given that traditional stages have, at best, 270 degrees of line of sight, these tours
503800	508700	only sell a portion of the 360 degrees of seats surrounding the stage, but the exact
508700	510560	number can be altered.
510560	514680	Therefore, if the concert hasn't sold out, management might decide to bring the stage
514680	518720	forward to kill some seats and make the venue appear more full, while if the concert has
518720	522280	sold out, they'd do their best to push the stage back to give more seats a sightline
522280	525440	and fit more on the floor, allowing them to sell additional tickets.
525680	529440	But they'd have to make this decision quickly because they're on the clock and the setup
529440	535680	has to start quick—the arena has no stage, no lights, no audio system, essentially nothing
535680	540480	but an empty floor and some seats, while thousands upon thousands of people are expecting a concert
540480	543160	in less than ten hours.
543160	545880	First in the order of operations is rigging.
545880	549720	This is essentially the process of getting anything that hangs, be it lights, speakers,
549720	554160	screens, prop pieces, or even the stage itself, up into the air.
554160	558120	Maybe a tour will include a lead rigger, or perhaps a few touring riggers, who work with
558120	562800	a far larger team of 20-40 local riggers to complete the incredibly time-sensitive setup
562800	565240	process for a given concert.
565240	569640	It starts with chalking out the floor, essentially, marking the exact spot on the ground where
569640	571720	a motor should hang above.
571720	575920	The core of the rigging task involves using a combination of math and cables to hang chain
575920	579680	motors in exact points from a grid of beams in the roof.
579680	584120	More often than not, there is not a beam directly above the exact point where a motor is needed,
584120	588320	so riggers hang two cables to bridge the gap between two beams.
588320	592740	Knowing both the horizontal and vertical distance from a beam to their desired point, the Pythagorean
592740	596880	Theorem is used to quickly calculate the required length of rope along the third axis, and these
596880	600920	lengths are marked on the floor with a standardized chalk diagram like this.
600920	604600	They also mark at the length of rope needed to wrap around each beam, given inconsistency
604600	608880	in width, and, if applicable, the length of a rope to hang beneath the connection of the
608880	610000	two others.
610040	614300	Finally, the exact point is marked with this symbol if it's up to a quarter-ton weight
614300	618600	and this for a half-ton, full-ton, and two-tons, respectively.
618600	622460	On a typical arena tour, there can be anywhere between a few dozen to over a hundred rigging
622460	626680	points that need to be assembled, so quickly, the team's upriggers harness up and head
626680	630400	out onto the beams above while the downriggers start laying out motors and other equipment
630400	632600	next to the relevant points.
632600	636520	Once in place, each uprigger lets down a rope to which their downrigger ties equipment to
636520	637520	be pulled up.
637520	641800	First, a burlap sack is wrapped around the beam to soften the edges, then ropes are fastened
641800	645900	around the beam, connected, and finally the chain motors are attached in the exact desired
645900	649760	point regardless of the variance in overhead grid from arena to arena.
649760	654060	Precision and safety are absolutely crucial given that within a matter of hours, both
654060	657680	the general public and some of the world's most recognizable artists will be standing
657680	658680	below.
658680	660920	The margin for error is essentially zero.
660920	666840	But to provide a standardized experience in a non-standard set of venues, rigging is crucial.
667560	671720	With anchor points set, the work of assembling lighting and audio trusses can go on, along
671720	673760	with setting up the stage itself.
673760	677400	Once each element is constructed on the ground, the motors above slowly pull them up into
677400	681880	place, also allowing the tour to hoist them to a common height regardless of the venue's
681880	682880	ceiling height.
682880	686920	Typically, and especially with the late start in Denver, this entire process needs to be
686920	691000	completed within four or five hours, by early afternoon.
691000	695040	Each department then takes a brief break for the lunch provided by the local caterers.
695040	699580	While the tour always strives to carry everything they need for a given show with them, reality
699580	701040	often gets in the way.
701040	705380	That's why the ensemble of hired local labor always includes runners whose job it is to
705380	709320	head out into the city to grab last-minute necessities, be it something as simple as
709320	714560	backstage snacks from Walmart or as crucial as fresh guitar picks from Guitar Center.
714560	718920	But all the big tasks should be completed by around now, mid-afternoon, because that's
718920	723520	when the artist arrives from their hotel and attention focuses on fine-tuning.
723520	727400	The soundcheck is a crucial milestone as it's the first test by the artists themselves
727400	728680	of the day's setup.
728680	732600	They play a few songs, both for calibrating the on-stage audio system, which is crucial
732600	736760	for making sure they can hear themselves properly, and testing the audience's audio system,
736760	740620	which needs to be fine-tuned both to the venue and the style of music.
740620	745300	As afternoon transitions into evening, the countdown to doors looms large.
745300	748840	The tour's head of security meets with the venue security to talk through some key elements.
748840	753140	They're in charge of passes, so they'll communicate which get access where, who can
753140	757380	go on the floor, backstage, to the VIP room, or even to the artist's room.
757380	761700	For the security work in the stage, they'll also talk through likely moments of artist-audience
761700	765940	interaction and what security support is needed—if the artist is going to pull audience members
765940	769700	up on stage, for example, security likes to know in advance.
769700	773700	And perhaps most importantly, the tour's security communicates likely audience demographics
773700	778060	and behavior—they know much better than local security the proclivities of their fans
778060	782900	and the likelihood of routiness, barrier crushing, mosh pits, and other potential security risks.
783540	785460	But finally, it's time.
785460	789880	The lighting department switches on a pre-programmed pre-show lighting configuration, audio starts
789880	794200	miking up the artists, security gets in a place, and everyone else finally gets their
794200	798980	first moments of calm since Salt Lake City as the doors open, the concert begins, and
798980	804100	the tour starts its unbelievable 24-hour cycle once again.
804100	809020	Clearly, given that you're still here, you enjoy learning about logistics.
809020	812780	So do I, of course, which is why I was recently fascinated to learn about what went into the
812780	817340	design and construction of the Twin Towers in New York through Neo's video on the subject.
817340	820960	It's a great watch, and right after that you can watch the latest episode from our
820960	825640	series Extremities about how Tristan da Cunha manages to survive as the world's most remote
825640	829700	inhabited island—the story of how people manage to live all the way out there is pretty
829700	830700	fascinating.
830700	834620	Then you could give Real Engineering's fantastic series The Logistics of D-Day a watch where
834620	838520	he shines a light on the perhaps less cinematic but certainly more fascinating efforts that
838520	841380	went into the Allies' landing on Normandy.
841380	845700	All of this top-tier logistics content is available exclusively on Nebula—the streaming
845700	849500	site co-founded by us creators and designed from the ground up to be the best home to
849500	850780	the stuff we make.

853760	857460	on YouTube, like videos about the logistics of the world's most remote places, and the
857460	860640	fact that it's not ad-supported means we don't have to shy away from more sensitive
860640	864580	topics like the logistics of some of the bloodiest days of World War II.
