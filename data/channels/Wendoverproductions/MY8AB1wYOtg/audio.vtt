WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
It just turned 1050pm on a warm September night, when the band returns to the USANA

00:05.000 --> 00:08.860
amphitheater stage southwest of Salt Lake City for an encore.

00:08.860 --> 00:13.100
Though they make it seem spontaneous, the move is, of course, planned, and the song

00:13.100 --> 00:15.180
had, of course, already been picked.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.740
It's the perfect send-off that will leave the crowd buzzing, and keep the band from

00:18.740 --> 00:22.220
violating the venue's strict 11pm curfew.

00:22.220 --> 00:26.420
But as the show ends and the audience makes its way to the exits, another meticulously

00:26.420 --> 00:31.940
choreographed and time-sensitive show begins—one with far less fanfare.

00:31.940 --> 00:38.480
The tour's next stop is Ball Arena, in Denver, 522 miles or 840 kilometers away, and that

00:38.480 --> 00:41.980
concert starts in exactly 21 hours.

00:41.980 --> 00:46.160
So now it's all hands on deck to get the band, their set, and their double-digit crew

00:46.160 --> 00:48.300
to Colorado on time.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.940
Really, this show, this process of getting the band and company from Salt Lake to Denver,

00:52.940 --> 00:56.660
began a few hours ago when the tour manager headed into their backstage office along with

00:56.660 --> 01:00.020
the venue's promoter carrying record of the night's box office receipts to hash

01:00.020 --> 01:04.780
out the money splits from ticketed merch sales to utilities and even clean towel fees, before

01:04.780 --> 01:07.020
coming to a final settlement.

01:07.020 --> 01:11.460
While an unspectacular process of crossing t's and dotting i's, it's this step

01:11.460 --> 01:15.940
that makes the tour possible, and really more than anything else, fuels the music economy

01:15.940 --> 01:16.940
today.

01:16.940 --> 01:22.180
The USANA amphitheater, after all, holds a maximum of 20,000 guests—that's 20,000

01:22.180 --> 01:25.540
potential ticket sales of which the band will receive an already agreed upon split

01:25.540 --> 01:28.900
somewhere in the ballpark of 85%.

01:28.900 --> 01:33.100
Once the money's settled and the band's finished, though, all attention focuses on

01:33.100 --> 01:34.100
the loadout.

01:34.100 --> 01:38.980
To be playing venues like the USANA amphitheater and Ball Arena, the band has to be big, and

01:38.980 --> 01:41.740
big bands tour with big staffs.

01:41.740 --> 01:45.980
This group, like most touring groups of its size, is broken into three groups.

01:45.980 --> 01:50.180
There's the A party, made up of the artists and their inner circle, the B party, made

01:50.180 --> 01:54.760
up of the band, dancers, and backup vocalists, and the C party, or the crew, from guitar

01:54.760 --> 01:57.020
techs to pyrotechnic specialists.

01:57.020 --> 02:01.500
To maximize overall efficiency, and the comfort of some, each party's taking a slightly

02:01.500 --> 02:03.300
different path to Denver.

02:03.300 --> 02:06.700
For the A party, it's off the stage, and depending on timing, grabbing something to

02:06.700 --> 02:11.100
eat or a shower, then heading straight north, in higher suburbans, to the Atlantic Aviation

02:11.100 --> 02:15.140
FBO at Salt Lake City International Airport, where a chartered jet is waiting.

02:15.140 --> 02:20.100
For the rest of the onstage talent, the turnaround is nearly just as quick.

02:20.100 --> 02:23.900
There's background vocalists and additional band members load onto tour buses that, depending

02:23.900 --> 02:27.980
on the configuration that the tour manager settled on months prior, can carry up to 12

02:27.980 --> 02:30.980
people spread across two aisles of triple stacked bunks.

02:30.980 --> 02:34.660
They're off the stage and out the door quick, but won't be seeing the other side of the

02:34.660 --> 02:36.900
Rockies until they wake up the next morning.

02:36.900 --> 02:41.300
For the C party, what they brought out and put together only hours earlier now needs

02:41.300 --> 02:45.140
to be returned into their cases and rolled back into their trailers in a precisely efficient

02:45.140 --> 02:47.700
order before they too hit the road.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.680
Under the oversight of production and stage managers, guitar techs carefully pack up guitars

02:51.680 --> 02:54.140
and riggers carefully dismantle the set.

02:54.140 --> 02:57.500
With the turnaround being so sharp, roadies working on the tour are joined by a hired

02:57.500 --> 03:01.600
set of local stagehands who help pack out everything from the band's audiovisual assets

03:01.600 --> 03:06.140
to the tour manager's office onto the trailers backed up against backstage.

03:06.140 --> 03:10.100
Once the venue's cleared, the C party, like the B party a couple hours ahead, jumps onto

03:10.100 --> 03:14.960
tour buses headed east, where showers and clean towels await them at the arena.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.680
And now the time crunch shifts from the crew to its drivers.

03:18.680 --> 03:23.020
None of the truck or bus drivers saw the band's show in Utah.

03:23.020 --> 03:24.280
They were sleeping.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.200
In fact, not until the show's end did those who were driving the B party even check out

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
of their hotels.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.300
And only after the show's conclusion did they begin their systems check, inspecting

03:33.300 --> 03:36.040
tires and timing belts before warming up the bus.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.800
They've waited until the very last minutes because their driving time is incredibly precious.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.660
By law, they can only drive for ten hours before they take a required eight-hour rest

03:45.660 --> 03:49.760
period, and with the electronic logging devices built into their dashboards and tracking the

03:49.760 --> 03:53.640
bus' every move, there's simply no cheating the ten-hour limit.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.040
Facing down 500-plus miles on the Rocky Mountain Range, Denver stretches the limits of what's

03:58.040 --> 04:02.200
possible when adding in stops, morning rush hour traffic, and the potential of anything

04:02.200 --> 04:03.340
unpredictable.

04:03.340 --> 04:06.560
Move the bus too early, and the next night's concert might get stuck on the side of the

04:06.560 --> 04:09.480
road short of the destination in Denver.

04:09.480 --> 04:14.280
Now, to an outsider, the loadout process might look chaotic, and the pace of the tour may

04:14.280 --> 04:16.900
seem unsustainable or unmanageable.

04:16.900 --> 04:22.300
But though grueling and exhaustingly complicated, these massive nationwide tours function remarkably

04:22.300 --> 04:25.220
smoothly considering the variety of variables.

04:25.220 --> 04:28.920
And they have to—there's too much on the line for them not to.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.120
This is where bands make their money, and this is where deadlines are their absolute

04:32.120 --> 04:35.960
toughest—a band can't simply reschedule in the middle of a tour during the middle

04:35.960 --> 04:38.000
of the busy summer season.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.420
To make these tours run smoothly, then, their managers leave no stone unturned.

04:43.420 --> 04:47.200
To minimize the chaos and limit potential mistakes, the band's tour began perhaps

04:47.200 --> 04:51.720
a month or two prior on the west coast, and had been in the works for upwards of a year.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.080
Knowing that dates fell quickly during the summer, their agent began negotiating fees

04:55.080 --> 04:58.720
and revenue splits with interested venues in the fall or winter prior, passing back

04:58.720 --> 05:02.760
and forth drafts of deal memos like these before ultimately coming to an agreement.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.680
With the concert dates penciled in, and a spot to rehearse for a few days prior identified

05:06.680 --> 05:10.600
somewhere in Southern California, the tour manager then sent their dates along to truck

05:10.600 --> 05:14.760
and bus leasing companies to go back and forth on price and configuration that best matched

05:14.760 --> 05:15.760
the band's needs.

05:15.760 --> 05:20.140
And with the venues locked, stage managers and production managers began assembling advance

05:20.140 --> 05:24.920
sheets that outline every last technical detail about the venue, from bus and trailer parking

05:24.920 --> 05:29.280
to office space and AV capabilities and hookups that the tour could possibly need to know

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
beforehand.

05:30.280 --> 05:35.800
Months ago, the tour manager also sent along a rider to each of the touring party's hotels—essentially,

05:35.800 --> 05:39.960
a sheet of requirements that spans from ensuring late checkout or day rooms to asking about

05:39.960 --> 05:42.700
whether or not there's any construction happening nearby.

05:42.700 --> 05:46.240
If meals are to be eaten at the hotel, dietary restrictions are communicated through this

05:46.240 --> 05:51.920
document, as are allergies or ETAs or even how room keys should be packaged and distributed.

05:51.920 --> 05:55.280
If the crew has an off day, it's important to find out what the bus parking nearby looks

05:55.280 --> 05:57.400
like and what's nearby for the crew to do.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.700
And if the band's famous enough, a likely scenario given the size of this tour, a rider

06:01.700 --> 06:06.360
will inform the hotel that access to backdoors and service elevators will be required.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.840
These documents often run pages long and aren't exclusive to hotels either, as tour managers

06:10.840 --> 06:15.180
will send ahead riders for the venue's backstage setup, from food to layout, as well as a technical

06:15.180 --> 06:18.820
rider spelling out the AV and rigging needs the show requires.

06:18.820 --> 06:22.740
Though sent to each hotel and venue long in advance, these riders are dynamic documents

06:22.740 --> 06:26.940
that change and evolve along with the tour, so managers will update and resend riders

06:26.940 --> 06:29.220
weeks and even days before their arrival.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.740
While the artists would have arrived at Centennial Airport in the early hours of the morning

06:32.740 --> 06:37.640
and quickly transfer to their hotel, the rest of the tour's day begins around 9 AM, laying

06:37.640 --> 06:41.940
in their bunks as their bus comes to a rest beside the loading dock of Denver's Ball

06:41.940 --> 06:42.940
Arena.

06:42.940 --> 06:46.180
Upon completing the eight hour drive through Wyoming, the driver hooks the bus up to a

06:46.180 --> 06:51.420
provided 240-volt connection to deliver power without idling the engine, and joins the tour's

06:51.420 --> 06:54.580
other bus and truck drivers for the short walk across the street to the Spring Hill

06:54.580 --> 06:58.340
Suites Hotel, where day rooms are booked, to get their legally required rest before

06:58.460 --> 07:01.060
driving onward after the concert that night.

07:01.060 --> 07:05.220
The above-average eight hour drive makes this day a particular challenge—everything must

07:05.220 --> 07:08.480
run perfectly to get the show built on time.

07:08.480 --> 07:12.300
The first people into the building are the tour's leadership—the production manager,

07:12.300 --> 07:16.460
production coordinator, head of security, lead rigger, and potentially others.

07:16.460 --> 07:19.840
Their first stop is the catering room, where a local company set up breakfast over the

07:19.840 --> 07:21.020
hours prior.

07:21.020 --> 07:25.060
Next, the team meets with the venue's management to conduct a walkthrough and plan out the

07:25.060 --> 07:26.060
day's activities.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.580
They then work their way through the backstage, posting this day sheet throughout to give

07:29.580 --> 07:33.380
a rundown of key moments through the day, and also labeling different rooms for different

07:33.380 --> 07:34.380
purposes.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.360
They'd need a production office, where the management would set up their desks, dressing

07:37.360 --> 07:41.020
rooms for both the lead artists and their supporting acts, a storage room for empty

07:41.020 --> 07:44.860
road cases and extra equipment, a wardrobe room for the costume department to get their

07:44.860 --> 07:48.980
work done, and more depending on the size and scope of the tour.

07:48.980 --> 07:52.620
In addition, they put up maps and directions for these different temporary rooms and key

07:52.620 --> 07:56.380
permanent spots like the venue's shower rooms, given that nearly everyone lives out

07:56.380 --> 07:57.820
of the tour bus.

07:57.820 --> 08:01.920
Nobody should need to know where they are—in fact, through the fatigue, many of the tour's

08:01.920 --> 08:04.740
members might genuinely forget.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.660
Also early in the order of operations is making the final decision on the placement of the

08:08.660 --> 08:09.660
stage.

08:09.660 --> 08:14.060
In North America, most large concerts occur in indoor arenas otherwise occupied by NHL

08:14.060 --> 08:19.200
and NBA hockey and basketball teams, as is the case with Denver's ball arena.

08:19.200 --> 08:23.800
Given that traditional stages have, at best, 270 degrees of line of sight, these tours

08:23.800 --> 08:28.700
only sell a portion of the 360 degrees of seats surrounding the stage, but the exact

08:28.700 --> 08:30.560
number can be altered.

08:30.560 --> 08:34.680
Therefore, if the concert hasn't sold out, management might decide to bring the stage

08:34.680 --> 08:38.720
forward to kill some seats and make the venue appear more full, while if the concert has

08:38.720 --> 08:42.280
sold out, they'd do their best to push the stage back to give more seats a sightline

08:42.280 --> 08:45.440
and fit more on the floor, allowing them to sell additional tickets.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.440
But they'd have to make this decision quickly because they're on the clock and the setup

08:49.440 --> 08:55.680
has to start quick—the arena has no stage, no lights, no audio system, essentially nothing

08:55.680 --> 09:00.480
but an empty floor and some seats, while thousands upon thousands of people are expecting a concert

09:00.480 --> 09:03.160
in less than ten hours.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.880
First in the order of operations is rigging.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.720
This is essentially the process of getting anything that hangs, be it lights, speakers,

09:09.720 --> 09:14.160
screens, prop pieces, or even the stage itself, up into the air.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.120
Maybe a tour will include a lead rigger, or perhaps a few touring riggers, who work with

09:18.120 --> 09:22.800
a far larger team of 20-40 local riggers to complete the incredibly time-sensitive setup

09:22.800 --> 09:25.240
process for a given concert.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.640
It starts with chalking out the floor, essentially, marking the exact spot on the ground where

09:29.640 --> 09:31.720
a motor should hang above.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.920
The core of the rigging task involves using a combination of math and cables to hang chain

09:35.920 --> 09:39.680
motors in exact points from a grid of beams in the roof.

09:39.680 --> 09:44.120
More often than not, there is not a beam directly above the exact point where a motor is needed,

09:44.120 --> 09:48.320
so riggers hang two cables to bridge the gap between two beams.

09:48.320 --> 09:52.740
Knowing both the horizontal and vertical distance from a beam to their desired point, the Pythagorean

09:52.740 --> 09:56.880
Theorem is used to quickly calculate the required length of rope along the third axis, and these

09:56.880 --> 10:00.920
lengths are marked on the floor with a standardized chalk diagram like this.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.600
They also mark at the length of rope needed to wrap around each beam, given inconsistency

10:04.600 --> 10:08.880
in width, and, if applicable, the length of a rope to hang beneath the connection of the

10:08.880 --> 10:10.000
two others.

10:10.040 --> 10:14.300
Finally, the exact point is marked with this symbol if it's up to a quarter-ton weight

10:14.300 --> 10:18.600
and this for a half-ton, full-ton, and two-tons, respectively.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.460
On a typical arena tour, there can be anywhere between a few dozen to over a hundred rigging

10:22.460 --> 10:26.680
points that need to be assembled, so quickly, the team's upriggers harness up and head

10:26.680 --> 10:30.400
out onto the beams above while the downriggers start laying out motors and other equipment

10:30.400 --> 10:32.600
next to the relevant points.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.520
Once in place, each uprigger lets down a rope to which their downrigger ties equipment to

10:36.520 --> 10:37.520
be pulled up.

10:37.520 --> 10:41.800
First, a burlap sack is wrapped around the beam to soften the edges, then ropes are fastened

10:41.800 --> 10:45.900
around the beam, connected, and finally the chain motors are attached in the exact desired

10:45.900 --> 10:49.760
point regardless of the variance in overhead grid from arena to arena.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.060
Precision and safety are absolutely crucial given that within a matter of hours, both

10:54.060 --> 10:57.680
the general public and some of the world's most recognizable artists will be standing

10:57.680 --> 10:58.680
below.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.920
The margin for error is essentially zero.

11:00.920 --> 11:06.840
But to provide a standardized experience in a non-standard set of venues, rigging is crucial.

11:07.560 --> 11:11.720
With anchor points set, the work of assembling lighting and audio trusses can go on, along

11:11.720 --> 11:13.760
with setting up the stage itself.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.400
Once each element is constructed on the ground, the motors above slowly pull them up into

11:17.400 --> 11:21.880
place, also allowing the tour to hoist them to a common height regardless of the venue's

11:21.880 --> 11:22.880
ceiling height.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.920
Typically, and especially with the late start in Denver, this entire process needs to be

11:26.920 --> 11:31.000
completed within four or five hours, by early afternoon.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.040
Each department then takes a brief break for the lunch provided by the local caterers.

11:35.040 --> 11:39.580
While the tour always strives to carry everything they need for a given show with them, reality

11:39.580 --> 11:41.040
often gets in the way.

11:41.040 --> 11:45.380
That's why the ensemble of hired local labor always includes runners whose job it is to

11:45.380 --> 11:49.320
head out into the city to grab last-minute necessities, be it something as simple as

11:49.320 --> 11:54.560
backstage snacks from Walmart or as crucial as fresh guitar picks from Guitar Center.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.920
But all the big tasks should be completed by around now, mid-afternoon, because that's

11:58.920 --> 12:03.520
when the artist arrives from their hotel and attention focuses on fine-tuning.

12:03.520 --> 12:07.400
The soundcheck is a crucial milestone as it's the first test by the artists themselves

12:07.400 --> 12:08.680
of the day's setup.

12:08.680 --> 12:12.600
They play a few songs, both for calibrating the on-stage audio system, which is crucial

12:12.600 --> 12:16.760
for making sure they can hear themselves properly, and testing the audience's audio system,

12:16.760 --> 12:20.620
which needs to be fine-tuned both to the venue and the style of music.

12:20.620 --> 12:25.300
As afternoon transitions into evening, the countdown to doors looms large.

12:25.300 --> 12:28.840
The tour's head of security meets with the venue security to talk through some key elements.

12:28.840 --> 12:33.140
They're in charge of passes, so they'll communicate which get access where, who can

12:33.140 --> 12:37.380
go on the floor, backstage, to the VIP room, or even to the artist's room.

12:37.380 --> 12:41.700
For the security work in the stage, they'll also talk through likely moments of artist-audience

12:41.700 --> 12:45.940
interaction and what security support is needed—if the artist is going to pull audience members

12:45.940 --> 12:49.700
up on stage, for example, security likes to know in advance.

12:49.700 --> 12:53.700
And perhaps most importantly, the tour's security communicates likely audience demographics

12:53.700 --> 12:58.060
and behavior—they know much better than local security the proclivities of their fans

12:58.060 --> 13:02.900
and the likelihood of routiness, barrier crushing, mosh pits, and other potential security risks.

13:03.540 --> 13:05.460
But finally, it's time.

13:05.460 --> 13:09.880
The lighting department switches on a pre-programmed pre-show lighting configuration, audio starts

13:09.880 --> 13:14.200
miking up the artists, security gets in a place, and everyone else finally gets their

13:14.200 --> 13:18.980
first moments of calm since Salt Lake City as the doors open, the concert begins, and

13:18.980 --> 13:24.100
the tour starts its unbelievable 24-hour cycle once again.

13:24.100 --> 13:29.020
Clearly, given that you're still here, you enjoy learning about logistics.

13:29.020 --> 13:32.780
So do I, of course, which is why I was recently fascinated to learn about what went into the

13:32.780 --> 13:37.340
design and construction of the Twin Towers in New York through Neo's video on the subject.

13:37.340 --> 13:40.960
It's a great watch, and right after that you can watch the latest episode from our

13:40.960 --> 13:45.640
series Extremities about how Tristan da Cunha manages to survive as the world's most remote

13:45.640 --> 13:49.700
inhabited island—the story of how people manage to live all the way out there is pretty

13:49.700 --> 13:50.700
fascinating.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.620
Then you could give Real Engineering's fantastic series The Logistics of D-Day a watch where

13:54.620 --> 13:58.520
he shines a light on the perhaps less cinematic but certainly more fascinating efforts that

13:58.520 --> 14:01.380
went into the Allies' landing on Normandy.

14:01.380 --> 14:05.700
All of this top-tier logistics content is available exclusively on Nebula—the streaming

14:05.700 --> 14:09.500
site co-founded by us creators and designed from the ground up to be the best home to

14:09.500 --> 14:10.780
the stuff we make.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.760
The economic model behind it means we can manage to fund things that wouldn't survive

14:13.760 --> 14:17.460
on YouTube, like videos about the logistics of the world's most remote places, and the

14:17.460 --> 14:20.640
fact that it's not ad-supported means we don't have to shy away from more sensitive

14:20.640 --> 14:24.580
topics like the logistics of some of the bloodiest days of World War II.

14:24.580 --> 14:28.940
Thanks to this, myself and my team have made all of these original documentaries, shows,

14:28.940 --> 14:31.700
and videos, and we keep releasing more each month.

14:31.700 --> 14:35.800
Plus, there's plenty more from plenty of other creators that you will almost certainly

14:35.800 --> 14:39.420
already watch, but what makes this almost certainly the best deal in streaming is the

14:39.420 --> 14:42.900
best way to sign up for Nebula—the CuriosityStream bundle deal.

14:42.900 --> 14:47.540
When you sign up for any subscription at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, they throw in a Nebula subscription

14:47.540 --> 14:50.540

14:54.580 --> 14:59.260
shows and documentaries, like the fascinating series Inside the Mind of a Con Artist.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.940
And while that's already an unbeatable deal on its own, signing up not only helps support

15:02.940 --> 15:07.180
Wendover Productions, but almost the entire educational creator ecosystem.

15:07.180 --> 15:10.500
