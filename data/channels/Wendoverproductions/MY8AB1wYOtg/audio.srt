1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It just turned 1050pm on a warm September night, when the band returns to the USANA

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,860
amphitheater stage southwest of Salt Lake City for an encore.

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,100
Though they make it seem spontaneous, the move is, of course, planned, and the song

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,180
had, of course, already been picked.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,740
It's the perfect send-off that will leave the crowd buzzing, and keep the band from

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,220
violating the venue's strict 11pm curfew.

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,420
But as the show ends and the audience makes its way to the exits, another meticulously

8
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,940
choreographed and time-sensitive show begins—one with far less fanfare.

9
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,480
The tour's next stop is Ball Arena, in Denver, 522 miles or 840 kilometers away, and that

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,980
concert starts in exactly 21 hours.

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,160
So now it's all hands on deck to get the band, their set, and their double-digit crew

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,300
to Colorado on time.

13
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,940
Really, this show, this process of getting the band and company from Salt Lake to Denver,

14
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,660
began a few hours ago when the tour manager headed into their backstage office along with

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,020
the venue's promoter carrying record of the night's box office receipts to hash

16
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,780
out the money splits from ticketed merch sales to utilities and even clean towel fees, before

17
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,020
coming to a final settlement.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,460
While an unspectacular process of crossing t's and dotting i's, it's this step

19
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,940
that makes the tour possible, and really more than anything else, fuels the music economy

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,940
today.

21
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,180
The USANA amphitheater, after all, holds a maximum of 20,000 guests—that's 20,000

22
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,540
potential ticket sales of which the band will receive an already agreed upon split

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,900
somewhere in the ballpark of 85%.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,100
Once the money's settled and the band's finished, though, all attention focuses on

25
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,100
the loadout.

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,980
To be playing venues like the USANA amphitheater and Ball Arena, the band has to be big, and

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,740
big bands tour with big staffs.

28
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:45,980
This group, like most touring groups of its size, is broken into three groups.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,180
There's the A party, made up of the artists and their inner circle, the B party, made

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,760
up of the band, dancers, and backup vocalists, and the C party, or the crew, from guitar

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,020
techs to pyrotechnic specialists.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,500
To maximize overall efficiency, and the comfort of some, each party's taking a slightly

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,300
different path to Denver.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,700
For the A party, it's off the stage, and depending on timing, grabbing something to

35
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,100
eat or a shower, then heading straight north, in higher suburbans, to the Atlantic Aviation

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,140
FBO at Salt Lake City International Airport, where a chartered jet is waiting.

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,100
For the rest of the onstage talent, the turnaround is nearly just as quick.

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,900
There's background vocalists and additional band members load onto tour buses that, depending

39
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,980
on the configuration that the tour manager settled on months prior, can carry up to 12

40
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,980
people spread across two aisles of triple stacked bunks.

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,660
They're off the stage and out the door quick, but won't be seeing the other side of the

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,900
Rockies until they wake up the next morning.

43
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,300
For the C party, what they brought out and put together only hours earlier now needs

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,140
to be returned into their cases and rolled back into their trailers in a precisely efficient

45
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,700
order before they too hit the road.

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,680
Under the oversight of production and stage managers, guitar techs carefully pack up guitars

47
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,140
and riggers carefully dismantle the set.

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,500
With the turnaround being so sharp, roadies working on the tour are joined by a hired

49
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,600
set of local stagehands who help pack out everything from the band's audiovisual assets

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,140
to the tour manager's office onto the trailers backed up against backstage.

51
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,100
Once the venue's cleared, the C party, like the B party a couple hours ahead, jumps onto

52
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,960
tour buses headed east, where showers and clean towels await them at the arena.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,680
And now the time crunch shifts from the crew to its drivers.

54
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,020
None of the truck or bus drivers saw the band's show in Utah.

55
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,280
They were sleeping.

56
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,200
In fact, not until the show's end did those who were driving the B party even check out

57
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
of their hotels.

58
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,300
And only after the show's conclusion did they begin their systems check, inspecting

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,040
tires and timing belts before warming up the bus.

60
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,800
They've waited until the very last minutes because their driving time is incredibly precious.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,660
By law, they can only drive for ten hours before they take a required eight-hour rest

62
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,760
period, and with the electronic logging devices built into their dashboards and tracking the

63
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,640
bus' every move, there's simply no cheating the ten-hour limit.

64
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,040
Facing down 500-plus miles on the Rocky Mountain Range, Denver stretches the limits of what's

65
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,200
possible when adding in stops, morning rush hour traffic, and the potential of anything

66
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,340
unpredictable.

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,560
Move the bus too early, and the next night's concert might get stuck on the side of the

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,480
road short of the destination in Denver.

69
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,280
Now, to an outsider, the loadout process might look chaotic, and the pace of the tour may

70
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,900
seem unsustainable or unmanageable.

71
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:22,300
But though grueling and exhaustingly complicated, these massive nationwide tours function remarkably

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,220
smoothly considering the variety of variables.

73
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,920
And they have to—there's too much on the line for them not to.

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,120
This is where bands make their money, and this is where deadlines are their absolute

75
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,960
toughest—a band can't simply reschedule in the middle of a tour during the middle

76
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,000
of the busy summer season.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,420
To make these tours run smoothly, then, their managers leave no stone unturned.

78
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,200
To minimize the chaos and limit potential mistakes, the band's tour began perhaps

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,720
a month or two prior on the west coast, and had been in the works for upwards of a year.

80
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,080
Knowing that dates fell quickly during the summer, their agent began negotiating fees

81
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,720
and revenue splits with interested venues in the fall or winter prior, passing back

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,760
and forth drafts of deal memos like these before ultimately coming to an agreement.

83
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,680
With the concert dates penciled in, and a spot to rehearse for a few days prior identified

84
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,600
somewhere in Southern California, the tour manager then sent their dates along to truck

85
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,760
and bus leasing companies to go back and forth on price and configuration that best matched

86
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,760
the band's needs.

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,140
And with the venues locked, stage managers and production managers began assembling advance

88
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,920
sheets that outline every last technical detail about the venue, from bus and trailer parking

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,280
to office space and AV capabilities and hookups that the tour could possibly need to know

90
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,280
beforehand.

91
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,800
Months ago, the tour manager also sent along a rider to each of the touring party's hotels—essentially,

92
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,960
a sheet of requirements that spans from ensuring late checkout or day rooms to asking about

93
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,700
whether or not there's any construction happening nearby.

94
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,240
If meals are to be eaten at the hotel, dietary restrictions are communicated through this

95
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,920
document, as are allergies or ETAs or even how room keys should be packaged and distributed.

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,280
If the crew has an off day, it's important to find out what the bus parking nearby looks

97
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,400
like and what's nearby for the crew to do.

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,700
And if the band's famous enough, a likely scenario given the size of this tour, a rider

99
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,360
will inform the hotel that access to backdoors and service elevators will be required.

100
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,840
These documents often run pages long and aren't exclusive to hotels either, as tour managers

101
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,180
will send ahead riders for the venue's backstage setup, from food to layout, as well as a technical

102
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,820
rider spelling out the AV and rigging needs the show requires.

103
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:22,740
Though sent to each hotel and venue long in advance, these riders are dynamic documents

104
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,940
that change and evolve along with the tour, so managers will update and resend riders

105
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,220
weeks and even days before their arrival.

106
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,740
While the artists would have arrived at Centennial Airport in the early hours of the morning

107
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,640
and quickly transfer to their hotel, the rest of the tour's day begins around 9 AM, laying

108
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,940
in their bunks as their bus comes to a rest beside the loading dock of Denver's Ball

109
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Arena.

110
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,180
Upon completing the eight hour drive through Wyoming, the driver hooks the bus up to a

111
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,420
provided 240-volt connection to deliver power without idling the engine, and joins the tour's

112
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,580
other bus and truck drivers for the short walk across the street to the Spring Hill

113
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,340
Suites Hotel, where day rooms are booked, to get their legally required rest before

114
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,060
driving onward after the concert that night.

115
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,220
The above-average eight hour drive makes this day a particular challenge—everything must

116
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,480
run perfectly to get the show built on time.

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,300
The first people into the building are the tour's leadership—the production manager,

118
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,460
production coordinator, head of security, lead rigger, and potentially others.

119
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,840
Their first stop is the catering room, where a local company set up breakfast over the

120
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,020
hours prior.

121
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,060
Next, the team meets with the venue's management to conduct a walkthrough and plan out the

122
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
day's activities.

123
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,580
They then work their way through the backstage, posting this day sheet throughout to give

124
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,380
a rundown of key moments through the day, and also labeling different rooms for different

125
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
purposes.

126
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,360
They'd need a production office, where the management would set up their desks, dressing

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,020
rooms for both the lead artists and their supporting acts, a storage room for empty

128
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,860
road cases and extra equipment, a wardrobe room for the costume department to get their

129
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,980
work done, and more depending on the size and scope of the tour.

130
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,620
In addition, they put up maps and directions for these different temporary rooms and key

131
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,380
permanent spots like the venue's shower rooms, given that nearly everyone lives out

132
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,820
of the tour bus.

133
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,920
Nobody should need to know where they are—in fact, through the fatigue, many of the tour's

134
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,740
members might genuinely forget.

135
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,660
Also early in the order of operations is making the final decision on the placement of the

136
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,660
stage.

137
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,060
In North America, most large concerts occur in indoor arenas otherwise occupied by NHL

138
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,200
and NBA hockey and basketball teams, as is the case with Denver's ball arena.

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,800
Given that traditional stages have, at best, 270 degrees of line of sight, these tours

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,700
only sell a portion of the 360 degrees of seats surrounding the stage, but the exact

141
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,560
number can be altered.

142
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,680
Therefore, if the concert hasn't sold out, management might decide to bring the stage

143
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,720
forward to kill some seats and make the venue appear more full, while if the concert has

144
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,280
sold out, they'd do their best to push the stage back to give more seats a sightline

145
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,440
and fit more on the floor, allowing them to sell additional tickets.

146
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,440
But they'd have to make this decision quickly because they're on the clock and the setup

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,680
has to start quick—the arena has no stage, no lights, no audio system, essentially nothing

148
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,480
but an empty floor and some seats, while thousands upon thousands of people are expecting a concert

149
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,160
in less than ten hours.

150
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,880
First in the order of operations is rigging.

151
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,720
This is essentially the process of getting anything that hangs, be it lights, speakers,

152
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,160
screens, prop pieces, or even the stage itself, up into the air.

153
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,120
Maybe a tour will include a lead rigger, or perhaps a few touring riggers, who work with

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,800
a far larger team of 20-40 local riggers to complete the incredibly time-sensitive setup

155
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,240
process for a given concert.

156
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,640
It starts with chalking out the floor, essentially, marking the exact spot on the ground where

157
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,720
a motor should hang above.

158
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,920
The core of the rigging task involves using a combination of math and cables to hang chain

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,680
motors in exact points from a grid of beams in the roof.

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,120
More often than not, there is not a beam directly above the exact point where a motor is needed,

161
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,320
so riggers hang two cables to bridge the gap between two beams.

162
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,740
Knowing both the horizontal and vertical distance from a beam to their desired point, the Pythagorean

163
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,880
Theorem is used to quickly calculate the required length of rope along the third axis, and these

164
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,920
lengths are marked on the floor with a standardized chalk diagram like this.

165
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,600
They also mark at the length of rope needed to wrap around each beam, given inconsistency

166
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,880
in width, and, if applicable, the length of a rope to hang beneath the connection of the

167
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,000
two others.

168
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,300
Finally, the exact point is marked with this symbol if it's up to a quarter-ton weight

169
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:18,600
and this for a half-ton, full-ton, and two-tons, respectively.

170
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,460
On a typical arena tour, there can be anywhere between a few dozen to over a hundred rigging

171
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,680
points that need to be assembled, so quickly, the team's upriggers harness up and head

172
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,400
out onto the beams above while the downriggers start laying out motors and other equipment

173
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,600
next to the relevant points.

174
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,520
Once in place, each uprigger lets down a rope to which their downrigger ties equipment to

175
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,520
be pulled up.

176
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,800
First, a burlap sack is wrapped around the beam to soften the edges, then ropes are fastened

177
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,900
around the beam, connected, and finally the chain motors are attached in the exact desired

178
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,760
point regardless of the variance in overhead grid from arena to arena.

179
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,060
Precision and safety are absolutely crucial given that within a matter of hours, both

180
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,680
the general public and some of the world's most recognizable artists will be standing

181
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
below.

182
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,920
The margin for error is essentially zero.

183
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:06,840
But to provide a standardized experience in a non-standard set of venues, rigging is crucial.

184
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,720
With anchor points set, the work of assembling lighting and audio trusses can go on, along

185
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,760
with setting up the stage itself.

186
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,400
Once each element is constructed on the ground, the motors above slowly pull them up into

187
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,880
place, also allowing the tour to hoist them to a common height regardless of the venue's

188
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,880
ceiling height.

189
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,920
Typically, and especially with the late start in Denver, this entire process needs to be

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,000
completed within four or five hours, by early afternoon.

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,040
Each department then takes a brief break for the lunch provided by the local caterers.

192
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,580
While the tour always strives to carry everything they need for a given show with them, reality

193
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,040
often gets in the way.

194
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,380
That's why the ensemble of hired local labor always includes runners whose job it is to

195
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,320
head out into the city to grab last-minute necessities, be it something as simple as

196
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,560
backstage snacks from Walmart or as crucial as fresh guitar picks from Guitar Center.

197
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,920
But all the big tasks should be completed by around now, mid-afternoon, because that's

198
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,520
when the artist arrives from their hotel and attention focuses on fine-tuning.

199
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,400
The soundcheck is a crucial milestone as it's the first test by the artists themselves

200
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,680
of the day's setup.

201
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,600
They play a few songs, both for calibrating the on-stage audio system, which is crucial

202
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,760
for making sure they can hear themselves properly, and testing the audience's audio system,

203
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,620
which needs to be fine-tuned both to the venue and the style of music.

204
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,300
As afternoon transitions into evening, the countdown to doors looms large.

205
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,840
The tour's head of security meets with the venue security to talk through some key elements.

206
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,140
They're in charge of passes, so they'll communicate which get access where, who can

207
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,380
go on the floor, backstage, to the VIP room, or even to the artist's room.

208
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:41,700
For the security work in the stage, they'll also talk through likely moments of artist-audience

209
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,940
interaction and what security support is needed—if the artist is going to pull audience members

210
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,700
up on stage, for example, security likes to know in advance.

211
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,700
And perhaps most importantly, the tour's security communicates likely audience demographics

212
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,060
and behavior—they know much better than local security the proclivities of their fans

213
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,900
and the likelihood of routiness, barrier crushing, mosh pits, and other potential security risks.

214
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,460
But finally, it's time.

215
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,880
The lighting department switches on a pre-programmed pre-show lighting configuration, audio starts

216
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,200
miking up the artists, security gets in a place, and everyone else finally gets their

217
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,980
first moments of calm since Salt Lake City as the doors open, the concert begins, and

218
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:24,100
the tour starts its unbelievable 24-hour cycle once again.

219
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,020
Clearly, given that you're still here, you enjoy learning about logistics.

220
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,780
So do I, of course, which is why I was recently fascinated to learn about what went into the

221
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:37,340
design and construction of the Twin Towers in New York through Neo's video on the subject.

222
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,960
It's a great watch, and right after that you can watch the latest episode from our

223
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,640
series Extremities about how Tristan da Cunha manages to survive as the world's most remote

224
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,700
inhabited island—the story of how people manage to live all the way out there is pretty

225
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,700
fascinating.

226
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,620
Then you could give Real Engineering's fantastic series The Logistics of D-Day a watch where

227
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,520
he shines a light on the perhaps less cinematic but certainly more fascinating efforts that

228
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,380
went into the Allies' landing on Normandy.

229
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,700
All of this top-tier logistics content is available exclusively on Nebula—the streaming

230
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,500
site co-founded by us creators and designed from the ground up to be the best home to

231
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,780
the stuff we make.

232
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,760
The economic model behind it means we can manage to fund things that wouldn't survive

233
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,460
on YouTube, like videos about the logistics of the world's most remote places, and the

234
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,640
fact that it's not ad-supported means we don't have to shy away from more sensitive

235
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,580
topics like the logistics of some of the bloodiest days of World War II.

236
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,940
Thanks to this, myself and my team have made all of these original documentaries, shows,

237
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,700
and videos, and we keep releasing more each month.

238
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,800
Plus, there's plenty more from plenty of other creators that you will almost certainly

239
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,420
already watch, but what makes this almost certainly the best deal in streaming is the

240
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,900
