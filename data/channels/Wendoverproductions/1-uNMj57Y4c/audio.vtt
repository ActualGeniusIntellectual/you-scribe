00:09.440 --> 00:13.720
Air travel is back… with an asterisk.

00:13.720 --> 00:21.440
In 2019, 79,332,046 people passed through TSA checkpoints in the month of July.

00:21.440 --> 00:29.400
In 2021, 63,118,017 did, representing an 80% demand recovery.

00:29.400 --> 00:35.220
This blows away most expert forecasts from 2020, and is a remarkable number considering

00:35.220 --> 00:40.640
international travel, and certainly international tourism, is still nearly non-existent.

00:40.640 --> 00:45.640
In Europe, air travel has recovered to around 70% of 2019 levels.

00:45.640 --> 00:50.640
In China, the number of scheduled seats has already surpassed 2019 numbers—they're

00:50.640 --> 00:52.720
beyond 100% recovery.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.280
So, the US, Europe, and China, the world's three largest aviation markets, have experienced

00:58.280 --> 01:01.680
recoveries beyond the most bullish expectations.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.160
But now, the asterisk.

01:04.160 --> 01:10.640
In the second financial quarter of 2019, United Airlines earned $11,402,000,000 in operating

01:10.640 --> 01:11.640
revenue.

01:11.640 --> 01:20.520
In the same quarter of 2021, however, just $5,471,000,000—about 48% of the 2019 number.

01:20.520 --> 01:28.040
Meanwhile, American and Delta's second quarter 2021 revenues were 62.5 and 56.8%, respectively,

01:28.040 --> 01:29.800
compared to 2019.

01:29.800 --> 01:35.040
Context does not make these numbers better because, in the second quarter of 2021, about

01:35.040 --> 01:40.080
67% as many travelers pass through TSA checkpoints as 2019.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.000
Simply put, revenue recovery is lagging behind demand recovery.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.680
A culprit is easily identifiable.

01:47.680 --> 01:53.920
In the second quarter of 2019, United earned 14.32 cents per seat per mile flown—available

01:53.920 --> 01:56.240
seat mile, as it's called in the industry.

01:56.240 --> 02:05.520
In 2021, they're earning just 11.02 cents per ASM—76.95% of that of 2019.

02:05.520 --> 02:14.920
Meanwhile, American's revenue per ASM is about 78.84% of 2019, while Delta's is 69.45%.

02:14.920 --> 02:19.860
While overall revenue should be considered entirely within the context of overall demand,

02:19.860 --> 02:22.660
revenue per ASM should not be.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.400
Airlines decide how many seat miles to make available.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.140
They decide how many flights to fly, so the fact that airlines are earning some 20-30%

02:30.140 --> 02:36.500
less per seat stamps a massive asterisk on the triumphant calls of travel's return.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.480
Travelers may be back, but they're not the same.

02:39.480 --> 02:44.560
In the US's summer 2021, the entire country seemingly went on vacation.

02:44.560 --> 02:49.080
Hiltons in Hawaii were going for four seasons prices, rental cars in Alaska were a luxury

02:49.080 --> 02:54.000
afforded to only the most four-sided travelers, and Ubers in Vegas were as elusive as a royal

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
flush.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.760
The US's tourism infrastructure was at absolute peak capacity in summer 2021, but then there's

03:01.760 --> 03:02.760
this.

03:02.760 --> 03:09.080
Midtown Manhattan, DC's K Street, Chicago's Loop—America's major business districts

03:09.080 --> 03:11.600
still sit abandoned.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.880
Despite the resurgence in life in the US, many of the country's largest office-based

03:15.880 --> 03:21.320
employers—including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Deloitte, Cisco, and McKinsey—have

03:21.320 --> 03:24.680
yet to return to the office in any meaningful way.

03:24.680 --> 03:29.280
When companies of this nature travel, they're doing so to visit other companies, so, without

03:29.280 --> 03:32.840
open offices, there are no companies to visit.

03:32.840 --> 03:37.040
Therefore, the fact that these companies, which include the top corporate travel spenders

03:37.040 --> 03:41.820
in the country, have yet to return to the office, explains why business travel has yet

03:41.820 --> 03:43.740
to return meaningfully.

03:43.740 --> 03:49.840
For United, American, Delta, British Airways, Air France, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines,

03:49.840 --> 03:54.880
Qantas—all the old, storied international airlines that you've heard of—this represents

03:54.880 --> 03:58.600
a disproportionately dramatic problem.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.220
These airlines, full-service network carriers, as they're called, are essentially designed

04:03.220 --> 04:06.120
to cater to the needs of business travelers.

04:06.120 --> 04:12.120
Take for example, the difference between Southwest, a leisure-focused airline, and United, a business-focused

04:12.120 --> 04:13.120
airline.

04:13.120 --> 04:17.480
If, for example, someone from Phoenix was traveling to Bozeman, Montana to visit Yellowstone

04:17.480 --> 04:21.160
National Park, they could choose to fly on Southwest.

04:21.160 --> 04:25.320
During the summer season, this airline operates a non-stop flight on the route each Saturday

04:25.320 --> 04:26.800
and Sunday morning.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.400
The same traveler could also choose to fly on United Airlines, through either Denver

04:30.400 --> 04:37.720
or Los Angeles, leaving at 610, 940, 1148, 155, or 341 pm each day.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.060
Leisure travelers, however, disproportionately value the convenience of a non-stop flight

04:42.060 --> 04:45.600
and they wouldn't mind organizing their trip around the two days per week when a flight

04:45.600 --> 04:47.240
operates.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.280
Business travelers, however, are different.

04:49.280 --> 04:53.900
Let's say a sales rep from Phoenix needed to travel to a client meeting in Memphis,

04:53.900 --> 04:57.080
taking place from 2 to 6 pm on a Tuesday.

04:57.080 --> 05:01.420
Southwest does have a non-stop flight between the cities, but in order to make that meeting,

05:01.420 --> 05:06.560
the traveler would have to take the Monday flight, leaving at 1225 pm, arriving at 520

05:06.560 --> 05:07.560
pm.

05:07.560 --> 05:11.640
They then have to sit around in Memphis for 21 hours until the meeting, then wait another

05:11.640 --> 05:15.400
23 hours after for the 4 pm Wednesday flight back.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.840
On United, however, the same traveler could leave at 6 am on Tuesday, connect through

05:19.840 --> 05:25.440
Denver, arrive at 1 pm, make the 2 pm meeting, then take a 7 am flight back through Houston

05:25.440 --> 05:29.680
the following morning and arrive at the office by noon, ready for the rest of the day's

05:29.680 --> 05:30.680
work.

05:30.680 --> 05:34.240
Faced with the prospect of waiting around in Memphis for almost a day more, they'll

05:34.240 --> 05:36.640
almost always pick United.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.840
In all, business travelers value not only the day of travel, but the time of day of

05:41.840 --> 05:42.840
travel.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.560
Therefore, it's all a compromise.

05:44.560 --> 05:49.000
Do you want flights going exactly where you want them to, or flights leaving exactly when

05:49.000 --> 05:50.680
you want them to?

05:50.680 --> 05:55.500
Disproportionately, leisure travelers value the former, business travelers the latter.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.920
This is why nearly every United, Delta, and American flight routes through one of their

05:59.920 --> 06:04.360
hubs—by consolidating travelers onto more regular flights to fewer destinations, they

06:04.360 --> 06:07.480
can offer far more choices of flight itineraries.

06:07.480 --> 06:11.360
The optimization for business travel extends beyond this to full-service network carriers

06:11.360 --> 06:17.140
focus on premium cabins, frequent flyer programs, airport services, and more, but fundamentally,

06:17.140 --> 06:21.920
there are stark differences between airlines made for leisure travelers and those for business

06:21.920 --> 06:26.640
travelers, and many of the world's largest airlines fall into that second category.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.100
Historically, however, it's been worth it.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.720
Business travelers are on the road year-round, rather than when the weather is good or school

06:33.720 --> 06:38.200
is out, meaning they represent a more reliable client base for airlines.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.720
In addition, they're more price inelastic.

06:40.760 --> 06:45.680
That's to say, when a consultant needs to travel, they truly need to travel, and will

06:45.680 --> 06:48.640
book a ticket regardless of the price.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.460
While leisure travelers will make decisions on price, businesses will pay whatever it

06:52.460 --> 06:56.520
takes to get their staff wherever they need to go to make the money.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.020
Only about 20% of domestic trips are taken by those on business, but they account for

07:01.020 --> 07:03.920
far more than 20% of revenue.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.240
That's because of what's referred to as price discrimination.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.440
It works off of a simple truth.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.540
Leisure travelers overwhelmingly make their plans and book trips months in advance, while

07:13.540 --> 07:17.280
business travelers book weeks or days in advance.

07:17.280 --> 07:21.320
Based on their own financial disclosures, we know that the average United flight length

07:21.320 --> 07:27.100
is currently 1,460 miles or 2,350 kilometers, and that their average cost to operate a flight

07:27.100 --> 07:31.820
of that length per passenger is $199.58.

07:31.820 --> 07:36.240
We also know that, two months before, United is selling tickets for eight of these twelve

07:36.240 --> 07:42.400
roughly 1,460-mile flights for below what it costs to operate on a per-passenger basis.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.680
In fact, the overall average fare for these twelve flights sits below their operating

07:46.680 --> 07:48.680
cost two months before departure.

07:48.680 --> 07:53.240
While the sale of ancillary such as extra legroom seats, checked luggage, wifi, food

07:53.240 --> 07:57.260
and beverage, and more would likely push them above break-even, it's clear that United

07:57.260 --> 08:02.500
would not turn a significant profit on the prices most of us pay for tickets—but that's

08:02.500 --> 08:03.720
by design.

08:03.720 --> 08:07.780
To fill planes, they need to sell cheap tickets—at least at first.

08:07.780 --> 08:12.280
In the weeks leading up to a flight, however, fares rise dramatically, so by the day before

08:12.280 --> 08:18.680
departure, the average fare for those twelve flights more than doubles to $413.83.

08:18.680 --> 08:22.880
These are the fares businesses are paying for their typically last-minute travel.

08:22.880 --> 08:28.300
Now, on that average 1,460-mile flight, imagine for the sake of simplicity that it was operated

08:28.300 --> 08:32.520
by an all-economy 179-seat 737-900.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.720
We know based on United's company-wide load factor, that 150 of its seats should

08:36.720 --> 08:37.720
be filled.

08:37.720 --> 08:42.840
In this case, their operating cost would total $29,937.

08:42.840 --> 08:48.440
Their total revenue from that flight, however, would be $36,245.

08:48.440 --> 08:53.760
That means the operating profit margin is $6,308.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.280
Imagining again for the sake of simplicity that United sold this hypothetical, perfectly

08:57.280 --> 09:05.200
average flight for either that $199.58 price point or $413.83 price point, that would mean,

09:05.200 --> 09:11.600
to attain their average $36,245 in revenue, they would need to sell 120 of the cheaper

09:11.600 --> 09:15.960
tickets, largely to just leisure travelers, and a mere 30 at the higher price point.

09:15.960 --> 09:21.860
That's just 20% of the overall tickets sold on this flight, but 20% happens to represent

09:21.860 --> 09:23.960
another important statistic.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.520
The average proportion of domestic air travel in the US completed by business travelers.

09:28.520 --> 09:33.160
It's not surprising that these numbers work together so perfectly, because this is the

09:33.160 --> 09:38.500
exact equation United and other business-oriented airlines have been using for decades.

09:38.500 --> 09:43.860
In the case of this hypothetical flight, it's the final 15 passengers—half of the business

09:43.860 --> 09:47.960
travelers—that make up the entirety of the airline's profit.

09:47.960 --> 09:52.360
Now, however, in the COVID era, they're gone.

09:52.360 --> 09:57.600
Southwest Airlines averaged 10.22 cents in operating cost per available seat mile in

09:57.600 --> 10:03.980
2021's second quarter, while United averaged 14.49 cents—a dramatic difference simply

10:03.980 --> 10:07.880
explained by the fact that Southwest is a low-cost airline, meaning its operating costs

10:07.880 --> 10:10.540
are low, and United is not.

10:10.540 --> 10:15.720
In a business environment now devoid of the majority of price inelastic business travelers,

10:15.720 --> 10:20.940
airlines like United have, and will have, a lot harder time keeping up with the recovery.

10:20.940 --> 10:25.580
While United, Delta, and American's revenue recovery all fell behind demand recovery in

10:25.580 --> 10:32.540
the second quarter, Southwest's was on track—67% overall recovery was, in their case, accompanied

10:32.540 --> 10:36.180
by 67.83% revenue recovery.

10:36.180 --> 10:42.700
And now, as August turns into September, recovery is only going to get tougher.

10:42.700 --> 10:49.160
Summer 2021 was one of the busiest on record for many American and European tourist destinations,

10:49.160 --> 10:51.480
but that's coming to an end.

10:51.480 --> 10:56.740
In a normal year, after a summer lull counterbalanced by the busiest leisure travel season, business

10:56.740 --> 11:01.360
travel starts picking up come early September and stays above average through the end of

11:01.360 --> 11:02.360
the year.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.480
This helps stabilize demand during a season when few travel for leisure purposes, but

11:06.480 --> 11:11.000
this year, that's not going to be there, in its full extent.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.920
This abnormally one-sided transition is already happening.

11:14.920 --> 11:20.100
Travel demand in the US dropped 2.8% between the week of July 25th and August 1st, then

11:20.100 --> 11:22.520
another 3% the week of August 8th.

11:22.520 --> 11:27.200
It's a small drop, but there are some initial indications that it's happening faster in

11:27.200 --> 11:33.160
2019, when the first 18 days of August saw 4.2% fewer travelers than the last 18 days

11:33.160 --> 11:34.160
of July.

11:34.160 --> 11:40.040
This year, the difference between those two sets of days is 5.5%.

11:40.040 --> 11:44.560
In absolute terms, that might not seem like a dramatic difference, but in relative terms,

11:44.560 --> 11:49.460
it means the demand drop is happening 30% faster, and these weeks represent only the

11:49.460 --> 11:53.880
very first of leisure travel's end-of-summer retreat.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.440
This trend will likely continue and, more importantly, accelerate as leisure travel

11:58.440 --> 12:02.220
continues to drop and business travel fails to rise.

12:02.220 --> 12:07.300
In the US, the next strong leisure travel period doesn't come until Thanksgiving,

12:07.300 --> 12:10.520
in November, and in Europe, it's Christmas.

12:10.520 --> 12:15.040
And of course, the Delta variant spread surely will not help, as businesses will play it

12:15.040 --> 12:20.280
safe with office openings and corporate travel, now realizing that the path out of the pandemic

12:20.280 --> 12:22.740
is not linear in nature.

12:22.740 --> 12:26.640
For airlines, there's not a whole lot that can be done at this point.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.040
What the world lacks right now is confidence.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.280
In the US, the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, tracking confidence

12:34.280 --> 12:38.940
in the overall state and the economy, recorded one of its largest drops in history between

12:38.940 --> 12:41.520
July and August 2021.

12:41.520 --> 12:46.420
It reached a level of 70.2, which is lower than any point in the pandemic so far, and

12:46.420 --> 12:49.520
its lowest level since the Great Recession.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.960
This is reflective of the amount of uncertainty the Delta variant and its rise in a post-vaccine

12:53.960 --> 12:58.540
era has caused, despite the fact that in the US, Europe, the UK, and other places where

12:58.540 --> 13:03.380
vaccines are now widely available, hospitalizations and deaths are still far from where they were

13:03.380 --> 13:05.840
when consumer sentiment was higher.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.240
Without the certainty of whether the pandemic will worsen or improve in the coming months,

13:10.240 --> 13:14.740
however, businesses will not make the big decisions that will bring business travel

13:14.740 --> 13:16.200
back.

13:16.200 --> 13:21.640
Summer will have likely marked the first profitable period of the pandemic for European and American

13:21.640 --> 13:25.880
airlines, but it seems increasingly unlikely that the recovery will continue its upward

13:25.880 --> 13:29.080
trend in fall without strong business travel.

13:29.080 --> 13:33.720
There's also the question of whether business travel will ever fully recover.

13:33.720 --> 13:37.800
Most experts believe doomsday predictions of Zoom-killing business travel to be overblown,

13:37.800 --> 13:43.040
however, there is a realistic possibility that 2019 could serve as the historical high-water

13:43.040 --> 13:46.880
mark for corporate travel as the world of big business moves increasingly digital and

13:46.880 --> 13:51.960
concerns about the environmental impacts of flying to lunch in another city mount.

13:51.960 --> 13:57.460
If this proves true, subtle changes will occur in the coming years that make United and Lufthansa

13:57.460 --> 14:00.200
look more like Southwest and EasyJet.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.760
COVID should have taught airlines just how important flexibility and adaptability is.

14:05.760 --> 14:10.580
It's hard to fault airlines for failing to turn a profit during the depths of a crisis,

14:10.580 --> 14:16.020
but now, as much of the developed world plots a slow, bumpy path out of the pandemic, there

14:16.020 --> 14:19.000
is opportunity for profitability.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.600
Therefore, this is when the test truly begins.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.460
This is what airlines were waiting for, so now, with cash reserves waned and investor

14:28.460 --> 14:35.940
goodwill gone, the coming months are truly make or break for airlines.

14:35.940 --> 14:40.440
Last year, around when COVID was starting, I decided to basically stop ordering takeout.

14:40.440 --> 14:45.160
I was the kind of person that was so busy that I ordered food almost every single day,

14:45.160 --> 14:49.480
but I eventually realized just how expensive and unhealthy this was.

14:49.480 --> 14:53.480
I was still tight on time, though, so I wanted a relatively easy way to make dinner at the

14:53.480 --> 14:58.360
end of the day that wasn't frozen pizza or ramen, so I found HelloFresh.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.500
I've now used them for about a year and a half, and actually asked them to sponsor

15:01.500 --> 15:03.480
the channel since I was such a fan.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.160
This is all completely true, and I even have the hundreds of recipe cards to prove it,

15:07.160 --> 15:11.020
but if you don't know what they are, HelloFresh sends you a box each week with all the fresh

15:11.020 --> 15:14.520
ingredients you need to make the meals you selected the previous week, and it all comes

15:14.520 --> 15:19.420
in the exact right quantities which cuts down both on prep and shopping time quite a lot.

15:19.420 --> 15:23.620
That way you go straight to cooking, like I did with these tropical teriyaki pork bowls,

15:23.620 --> 15:25.660
which are one of my favorite meals of theirs.

15:25.660 --> 15:29.640
It also turns out that HelloFresh is a more sustainable meals option, as research has

15:29.640 --> 15:34.360
found their carbon footprint is 25% lower than meals from grocery store ingredients,

15:34.360 --> 15:38.400
partially since it cuts down on food waste by sending the exact quantities you need.

15:38.400 --> 15:43.560
Also, getting all these options means I tend to try types of food that I wouldn't normally—it's

15:43.560 --> 15:46.240
a great way to increase variety at dinnertime.

15:46.240 --> 15:51.280
Best of all, you can go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER14 to get 14 free meals

15:51.280 --> 15:52.480
