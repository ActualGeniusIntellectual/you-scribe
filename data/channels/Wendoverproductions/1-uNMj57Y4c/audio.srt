3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,720
Air travel is back… with an asterisk.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,440
In 2019, 79,332,046 people passed through TSA checkpoints in the month of July.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:29,400
In 2021, 63,118,017 did, representing an 80% demand recovery.

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,220
This blows away most expert forecasts from 2020, and is a remarkable number considering

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:40,640
international travel, and certainly international tourism, is still nearly non-existent.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
In Europe, air travel has recovered to around 70% of 2019 levels.

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,640
In China, the number of scheduled seats has already surpassed 2019 numbers—they're

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,720
beyond 100% recovery.

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,280
So, the US, Europe, and China, the world's three largest aviation markets, have experienced

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,680
recoveries beyond the most bullish expectations.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,160
But now, the asterisk.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,640
In the second financial quarter of 2019, United Airlines earned $11,402,000,000 in operating

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,640
revenue.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,520
In the same quarter of 2021, however, just $5,471,000,000—about 48% of the 2019 number.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:28,040
Meanwhile, American and Delta's second quarter 2021 revenues were 62.5 and 56.8%, respectively,

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,800
compared to 2019.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:35,040
Context does not make these numbers better because, in the second quarter of 2021, about

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,080
67% as many travelers pass through TSA checkpoints as 2019.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,000
Simply put, revenue recovery is lagging behind demand recovery.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,680
A culprit is easily identifiable.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,920
In the second quarter of 2019, United earned 14.32 cents per seat per mile flown—available

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
seat mile, as it's called in the industry.

25
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:05,520
In 2021, they're earning just 11.02 cents per ASM—76.95% of that of 2019.

26
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:14,920
Meanwhile, American's revenue per ASM is about 78.84% of 2019, while Delta's is 69.45%.

27
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,860
While overall revenue should be considered entirely within the context of overall demand,

28
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,660
revenue per ASM should not be.

29
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,400
Airlines decide how many seat miles to make available.

30
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,140
They decide how many flights to fly, so the fact that airlines are earning some 20-30%

31
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:36,500
less per seat stamps a massive asterisk on the triumphant calls of travel's return.

32
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,480
Travelers may be back, but they're not the same.

33
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,560
In the US's summer 2021, the entire country seemingly went on vacation.

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,080
Hiltons in Hawaii were going for four seasons prices, rental cars in Alaska were a luxury

35
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,000
afforded to only the most four-sided travelers, and Ubers in Vegas were as elusive as a royal

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
flush.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,760
The US's tourism infrastructure was at absolute peak capacity in summer 2021, but then there's

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
this.

39
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:09,080
Midtown Manhattan, DC's K Street, Chicago's Loop—America's major business districts

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,600
still sit abandoned.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,880
Despite the resurgence in life in the US, many of the country's largest office-based

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:21,320
employers—including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Deloitte, Cisco, and McKinsey—have

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,680
yet to return to the office in any meaningful way.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,280
When companies of this nature travel, they're doing so to visit other companies, so, without

45
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,840
open offices, there are no companies to visit.

46
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,040
Therefore, the fact that these companies, which include the top corporate travel spenders

47
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,820
in the country, have yet to return to the office, explains why business travel has yet

48
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,740
to return meaningfully.

49
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,840
For United, American, Delta, British Airways, Air France, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines,

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,880
Qantas—all the old, storied international airlines that you've heard of—this represents

51
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,600
a disproportionately dramatic problem.

52
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,220
These airlines, full-service network carriers, as they're called, are essentially designed

53
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,120
to cater to the needs of business travelers.

54
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,120
Take for example, the difference between Southwest, a leisure-focused airline, and United, a business-focused

55
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,120
airline.

56
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,480
If, for example, someone from Phoenix was traveling to Bozeman, Montana to visit Yellowstone

57
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,160
National Park, they could choose to fly on Southwest.

58
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,320
During the summer season, this airline operates a non-stop flight on the route each Saturday

59
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,800
and Sunday morning.

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,400
The same traveler could also choose to fly on United Airlines, through either Denver

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,720
or Los Angeles, leaving at 610, 940, 1148, 155, or 341 pm each day.

62
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,060
Leisure travelers, however, disproportionately value the convenience of a non-stop flight

63
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,600
and they wouldn't mind organizing their trip around the two days per week when a flight

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,240
operates.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,280
Business travelers, however, are different.

66
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,900
Let's say a sales rep from Phoenix needed to travel to a client meeting in Memphis,

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,080
taking place from 2 to 6 pm on a Tuesday.

68
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,420
Southwest does have a non-stop flight between the cities, but in order to make that meeting,

69
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,560
the traveler would have to take the Monday flight, leaving at 1225 pm, arriving at 520

70
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
pm.

71
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,640
They then have to sit around in Memphis for 21 hours until the meeting, then wait another

72
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,400
23 hours after for the 4 pm Wednesday flight back.

73
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,840
On United, however, the same traveler could leave at 6 am on Tuesday, connect through

74
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,440
Denver, arrive at 1 pm, make the 2 pm meeting, then take a 7 am flight back through Houston

75
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,680
the following morning and arrive at the office by noon, ready for the rest of the day's

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
work.

77
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,240
Faced with the prospect of waiting around in Memphis for almost a day more, they'll

78
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,640
almost always pick United.

79
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,840
In all, business travelers value not only the day of travel, but the time of day of

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
travel.

81
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,560
Therefore, it's all a compromise.

82
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you want flights going exactly where you want them to, or flights leaving exactly when

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,680
you want them to?

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,500
Disproportionately, leisure travelers value the former, business travelers the latter.

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,920
This is why nearly every United, Delta, and American flight routes through one of their

86
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,360
hubs—by consolidating travelers onto more regular flights to fewer destinations, they

87
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,480
can offer far more choices of flight itineraries.

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,360
The optimization for business travel extends beyond this to full-service network carriers

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,140
focus on premium cabins, frequent flyer programs, airport services, and more, but fundamentally,

90
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,920
there are stark differences between airlines made for leisure travelers and those for business

91
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,640
travelers, and many of the world's largest airlines fall into that second category.

92
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,100
Historically, however, it's been worth it.

93
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,720
Business travelers are on the road year-round, rather than when the weather is good or school

94
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,200
is out, meaning they represent a more reliable client base for airlines.

95
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,720
In addition, they're more price inelastic.

96
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,680
That's to say, when a consultant needs to travel, they truly need to travel, and will

97
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,640
book a ticket regardless of the price.

98
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,460
While leisure travelers will make decisions on price, businesses will pay whatever it

99
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,520
takes to get their staff wherever they need to go to make the money.

100
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,020
Only about 20% of domestic trips are taken by those on business, but they account for

101
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,920
far more than 20% of revenue.

102
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,240
That's because of what's referred to as price discrimination.

103
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,440
It works off of a simple truth.

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,540
Leisure travelers overwhelmingly make their plans and book trips months in advance, while

105
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,280
business travelers book weeks or days in advance.

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,320
Based on their own financial disclosures, we know that the average United flight length

107
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,100
is currently 1,460 miles or 2,350 kilometers, and that their average cost to operate a flight

108
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,820
of that length per passenger is $199.58.

109
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,240
We also know that, two months before, United is selling tickets for eight of these twelve

110
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,400
roughly 1,460-mile flights for below what it costs to operate on a per-passenger basis.

111
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,680
In fact, the overall average fare for these twelve flights sits below their operating

112
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,680
cost two months before departure.

113
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,240
While the sale of ancillary such as extra legroom seats, checked luggage, wifi, food

114
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,260
and beverage, and more would likely push them above break-even, it's clear that United

115
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,500
would not turn a significant profit on the prices most of us pay for tickets—but that's

116
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,720
by design.

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,780
To fill planes, they need to sell cheap tickets—at least at first.

118
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,280
In the weeks leading up to a flight, however, fares rise dramatically, so by the day before

119
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:18,680
departure, the average fare for those twelve flights more than doubles to $413.83.

120
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,880
These are the fares businesses are paying for their typically last-minute travel.

121
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,300
Now, on that average 1,460-mile flight, imagine for the sake of simplicity that it was operated

122
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,520
by an all-economy 179-seat 737-900.

123
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,720
We know based on United's company-wide load factor, that 150 of its seats should

124
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
be filled.

125
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,840
In this case, their operating cost would total $29,937.

126
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,440
Their total revenue from that flight, however, would be $36,245.

127
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,760
That means the operating profit margin is $6,308.

128
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,280
Imagining again for the sake of simplicity that United sold this hypothetical, perfectly

129
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:05,200
average flight for either that $199.58 price point or $413.83 price point, that would mean,

130
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,600
to attain their average $36,245 in revenue, they would need to sell 120 of the cheaper

131
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,960
tickets, largely to just leisure travelers, and a mere 30 at the higher price point.

132
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:21,860
That's just 20% of the overall tickets sold on this flight, but 20% happens to represent

133
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,960
another important statistic.

134
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,520
The average proportion of domestic air travel in the US completed by business travelers.

135
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:33,160
It's not surprising that these numbers work together so perfectly, because this is the

136
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,500
exact equation United and other business-oriented airlines have been using for decades.

137
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,860
In the case of this hypothetical flight, it's the final 15 passengers—half of the business

138
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,960
travelers—that make up the entirety of the airline's profit.

139
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,360
Now, however, in the COVID era, they're gone.

140
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,600
Southwest Airlines averaged 10.22 cents in operating cost per available seat mile in

141
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,980
2021's second quarter, while United averaged 14.49 cents—a dramatic difference simply

142
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,880
explained by the fact that Southwest is a low-cost airline, meaning its operating costs

143
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,540
are low, and United is not.

144
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:15,720
In a business environment now devoid of the majority of price inelastic business travelers,

145
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,940
airlines like United have, and will have, a lot harder time keeping up with the recovery.

146
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,580
While United, Delta, and American's revenue recovery all fell behind demand recovery in

147
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:32,540
the second quarter, Southwest's was on track—67% overall recovery was, in their case, accompanied

148
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,180
by 67.83% revenue recovery.

149
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,700
And now, as August turns into September, recovery is only going to get tougher.

150
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:49,160
Summer 2021 was one of the busiest on record for many American and European tourist destinations,

151
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,480
but that's coming to an end.

152
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,740
In a normal year, after a summer lull counterbalanced by the busiest leisure travel season, business

153
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,360
travel starts picking up come early September and stays above average through the end of

154
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
the year.

155
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,480
This helps stabilize demand during a season when few travel for leisure purposes, but

156
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,000
this year, that's not going to be there, in its full extent.

157
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,920
This abnormally one-sided transition is already happening.

158
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,100
Travel demand in the US dropped 2.8% between the week of July 25th and August 1st, then

159
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,520
another 3% the week of August 8th.

160
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,200
It's a small drop, but there are some initial indications that it's happening faster in

161
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,160
2019, when the first 18 days of August saw 4.2% fewer travelers than the last 18 days

162
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,160
of July.

163
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,040
This year, the difference between those two sets of days is 5.5%.

164
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,560
In absolute terms, that might not seem like a dramatic difference, but in relative terms,

165
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,460
it means the demand drop is happening 30% faster, and these weeks represent only the

166
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,880
very first of leisure travel's end-of-summer retreat.

167
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,440
This trend will likely continue and, more importantly, accelerate as leisure travel

168
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,220
continues to drop and business travel fails to rise.

169
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,300
In the US, the next strong leisure travel period doesn't come until Thanksgiving,

170
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,520
in November, and in Europe, it's Christmas.

171
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,040
And of course, the Delta variant spread surely will not help, as businesses will play it

172
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,280
safe with office openings and corporate travel, now realizing that the path out of the pandemic

173
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,740
is not linear in nature.

174
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,640
For airlines, there's not a whole lot that can be done at this point.

175
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,040
What the world lacks right now is confidence.

176
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,280
In the US, the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, tracking confidence

177
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,940
in the overall state and the economy, recorded one of its largest drops in history between

178
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,520
July and August 2021.

179
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,420
It reached a level of 70.2, which is lower than any point in the pandemic so far, and

180
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,520
its lowest level since the Great Recession.

181
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,960
This is reflective of the amount of uncertainty the Delta variant and its rise in a post-vaccine

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,540
era has caused, despite the fact that in the US, Europe, the UK, and other places where

183
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,380
vaccines are now widely available, hospitalizations and deaths are still far from where they were

184
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,840
when consumer sentiment was higher.

185
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,240
Without the certainty of whether the pandemic will worsen or improve in the coming months,

186
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,740
however, businesses will not make the big decisions that will bring business travel

187
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,200
back.

188
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,640
Summer will have likely marked the first profitable period of the pandemic for European and American

189
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,880
airlines, but it seems increasingly unlikely that the recovery will continue its upward

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,080
trend in fall without strong business travel.

191
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,720
There's also the question of whether business travel will ever fully recover.

192
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,800
Most experts believe doomsday predictions of Zoom-killing business travel to be overblown,

193
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,040
however, there is a realistic possibility that 2019 could serve as the historical high-water

194
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,880
mark for corporate travel as the world of big business moves increasingly digital and

195
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,960
concerns about the environmental impacts of flying to lunch in another city mount.

196
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,460
If this proves true, subtle changes will occur in the coming years that make United and Lufthansa

197
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,200
look more like Southwest and EasyJet.

198
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,760
COVID should have taught airlines just how important flexibility and adaptability is.

199
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,580
It's hard to fault airlines for failing to turn a profit during the depths of a crisis,

200
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,020
but now, as much of the developed world plots a slow, bumpy path out of the pandemic, there

201
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,000
is opportunity for profitability.

202
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,600
Therefore, this is when the test truly begins.

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,460
This is what airlines were waiting for, so now, with cash reserves waned and investor

204
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:35,940
goodwill gone, the coming months are truly make or break for airlines.

205
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,440
Last year, around when COVID was starting, I decided to basically stop ordering takeout.

206
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,160
I was the kind of person that was so busy that I ordered food almost every single day,

207
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,480
but I eventually realized just how expensive and unhealthy this was.

208
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I was still tight on time, though, so I wanted a relatively easy way to make dinner at the

209
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,360
end of the day that wasn't frozen pizza or ramen, so I found HelloFresh.

210
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,500
I've now used them for about a year and a half, and actually asked them to sponsor

211
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,480
the channel since I was such a fan.

212
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,160
This is all completely true, and I even have the hundreds of recipe cards to prove it,

213
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,020
but if you don't know what they are, HelloFresh sends you a box each week with all the fresh

214
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,520
ingredients you need to make the meals you selected the previous week, and it all comes

215
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,420
in the exact right quantities which cuts down both on prep and shopping time quite a lot.

216
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,620
That way you go straight to cooking, like I did with these tropical teriyaki pork bowls,

217
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,660
which are one of my favorite meals of theirs.

218
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,640
It also turns out that HelloFresh is a more sustainable meals option, as research has

219
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,360
found their carbon footprint is 25% lower than meals from grocery store ingredients,

220
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,400
partially since it cuts down on food waste by sending the exact quantities you need.

221
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,560
Also, getting all these options means I tend to try types of food that I wouldn't normally—it's

222
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,240
a great way to increase variety at dinnertime.

223
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:51,280
Best of all, you can go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER14 to get 14 free meals

224
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,480
plus free shipping.

225

You'll see why I like them so much and help support Wendover simultaneously, so head there
