9440	13720	Air travel is back… with an asterisk.
13720	21440	In 2019, 79,332,046 people passed through TSA checkpoints in the month of July.
21440	29400	In 2021, 63,118,017 did, representing an 80% demand recovery.
29400	35220	This blows away most expert forecasts from 2020, and is a remarkable number considering
35220	40640	international travel, and certainly international tourism, is still nearly non-existent.
40640	45640	In Europe, air travel has recovered to around 70% of 2019 levels.
45640	50640	In China, the number of scheduled seats has already surpassed 2019 numbers—they're
50640	52720	beyond 100% recovery.
52720	58280	So, the US, Europe, and China, the world's three largest aviation markets, have experienced
58280	61680	recoveries beyond the most bullish expectations.
61680	64160	But now, the asterisk.
64160	70640	In the second financial quarter of 2019, United Airlines earned $11,402,000,000 in operating
70640	71640	revenue.
71640	80520	In the same quarter of 2021, however, just $5,471,000,000—about 48% of the 2019 number.
80520	88040	Meanwhile, American and Delta's second quarter 2021 revenues were 62.5 and 56.8%, respectively,
88040	89800	compared to 2019.
89800	95040	Context does not make these numbers better because, in the second quarter of 2021, about
95040	100080	67% as many travelers pass through TSA checkpoints as 2019.
100080	105000	Simply put, revenue recovery is lagging behind demand recovery.
105000	107680	A culprit is easily identifiable.
107680	113920	In the second quarter of 2019, United earned 14.32 cents per seat per mile flown—available
113920	116240	seat mile, as it's called in the industry.
116240	125520	In 2021, they're earning just 11.02 cents per ASM—76.95% of that of 2019.
125520	134920	Meanwhile, American's revenue per ASM is about 78.84% of 2019, while Delta's is 69.45%.
134920	139860	While overall revenue should be considered entirely within the context of overall demand,
139860	142660	revenue per ASM should not be.
142660	145400	Airlines decide how many seat miles to make available.
145400	150140	They decide how many flights to fly, so the fact that airlines are earning some 20-30%
150140	156500	less per seat stamps a massive asterisk on the triumphant calls of travel's return.
156500	159480	Travelers may be back, but they're not the same.
159480	164560	In the US's summer 2021, the entire country seemingly went on vacation.
164560	169080	Hiltons in Hawaii were going for four seasons prices, rental cars in Alaska were a luxury
169080	174000	afforded to only the most four-sided travelers, and Ubers in Vegas were as elusive as a royal
174000	175000	flush.
175000	181760	The US's tourism infrastructure was at absolute peak capacity in summer 2021, but then there's
181760	182760	this.
182760	189080	Midtown Manhattan, DC's K Street, Chicago's Loop—America's major business districts
189080	191600	still sit abandoned.
191600	195880	Despite the resurgence in life in the US, many of the country's largest office-based
195880	201320	employers—including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Deloitte, Cisco, and McKinsey—have
201320	204680	yet to return to the office in any meaningful way.
204680	209280	When companies of this nature travel, they're doing so to visit other companies, so, without
209280	212840	open offices, there are no companies to visit.
212840	217040	Therefore, the fact that these companies, which include the top corporate travel spenders
217040	221820	in the country, have yet to return to the office, explains why business travel has yet
221820	223740	to return meaningfully.
223740	229840	For United, American, Delta, British Airways, Air France, Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines,
229840	234880	Qantas—all the old, storied international airlines that you've heard of—this represents
234880	238600	a disproportionately dramatic problem.
238600	243220	These airlines, full-service network carriers, as they're called, are essentially designed
243220	246120	to cater to the needs of business travelers.
246120	252120	Take for example, the difference between Southwest, a leisure-focused airline, and United, a business-focused
252120	253120	airline.
253120	257480	If, for example, someone from Phoenix was traveling to Bozeman, Montana to visit Yellowstone
257480	261160	National Park, they could choose to fly on Southwest.
261160	265320	During the summer season, this airline operates a non-stop flight on the route each Saturday
265320	266800	and Sunday morning.
266800	270400	The same traveler could also choose to fly on United Airlines, through either Denver
270400	277720	or Los Angeles, leaving at 610, 940, 1148, 155, or 341 pm each day.
277720	282060	Leisure travelers, however, disproportionately value the convenience of a non-stop flight
282060	285600	and they wouldn't mind organizing their trip around the two days per week when a flight
285600	287240	operates.
287240	289280	Business travelers, however, are different.
289280	293900	Let's say a sales rep from Phoenix needed to travel to a client meeting in Memphis,
293900	297080	taking place from 2 to 6 pm on a Tuesday.
297080	301420	Southwest does have a non-stop flight between the cities, but in order to make that meeting,
301420	306560	the traveler would have to take the Monday flight, leaving at 1225 pm, arriving at 520
306560	307560	pm.
307560	311640	They then have to sit around in Memphis for 21 hours until the meeting, then wait another
311640	315400	23 hours after for the 4 pm Wednesday flight back.
315400	319840	On United, however, the same traveler could leave at 6 am on Tuesday, connect through
319840	325440	Denver, arrive at 1 pm, make the 2 pm meeting, then take a 7 am flight back through Houston
325440	329680	the following morning and arrive at the office by noon, ready for the rest of the day's
329680	330680	work.
330680	334240	Faced with the prospect of waiting around in Memphis for almost a day more, they'll
334240	336640	almost always pick United.
336640	341840	In all, business travelers value not only the day of travel, but the time of day of
341840	342840	travel.
342840	344560	Therefore, it's all a compromise.
344560	349000	Do you want flights going exactly where you want them to, or flights leaving exactly when
349000	350680	you want them to?
350680	355500	Disproportionately, leisure travelers value the former, business travelers the latter.
355500	359920	This is why nearly every United, Delta, and American flight routes through one of their
359920	364360	hubs—by consolidating travelers onto more regular flights to fewer destinations, they
364360	367480	can offer far more choices of flight itineraries.
367480	371360	The optimization for business travel extends beyond this to full-service network carriers
371360	377140	focus on premium cabins, frequent flyer programs, airport services, and more, but fundamentally,
377140	381920	there are stark differences between airlines made for leisure travelers and those for business
381920	386640	travelers, and many of the world's largest airlines fall into that second category.
386640	390100	Historically, however, it's been worth it.
390100	393720	Business travelers are on the road year-round, rather than when the weather is good or school
393720	398200	is out, meaning they represent a more reliable client base for airlines.
398200	400720	In addition, they're more price inelastic.
400760	405680	That's to say, when a consultant needs to travel, they truly need to travel, and will
405680	408640	book a ticket regardless of the price.
408640	412460	While leisure travelers will make decisions on price, businesses will pay whatever it
412460	416520	takes to get their staff wherever they need to go to make the money.
416520	421020	Only about 20% of domestic trips are taken by those on business, but they account for
421020	423920	far more than 20% of revenue.
423920	427240	That's because of what's referred to as price discrimination.
427240	429440	It works off of a simple truth.
429440	433540	Leisure travelers overwhelmingly make their plans and book trips months in advance, while
433540	437280	business travelers book weeks or days in advance.
437280	441320	Based on their own financial disclosures, we know that the average United flight length
441320	447100	is currently 1,460 miles or 2,350 kilometers, and that their average cost to operate a flight
447100	451820	of that length per passenger is $199.58.
451820	456240	We also know that, two months before, United is selling tickets for eight of these twelve
456240	462400	roughly 1,460-mile flights for below what it costs to operate on a per-passenger basis.
462400	466680	In fact, the overall average fare for these twelve flights sits below their operating
466680	468680	cost two months before departure.
468680	473240	While the sale of ancillary such as extra legroom seats, checked luggage, wifi, food
473240	477260	and beverage, and more would likely push them above break-even, it's clear that United
477260	482500	would not turn a significant profit on the prices most of us pay for tickets—but that's
482500	483720	by design.
483720	487780	To fill planes, they need to sell cheap tickets—at least at first.
487780	492280	In the weeks leading up to a flight, however, fares rise dramatically, so by the day before
492280	498680	departure, the average fare for those twelve flights more than doubles to $413.83.
498680	502880	These are the fares businesses are paying for their typically last-minute travel.
502880	508300	Now, on that average 1,460-mile flight, imagine for the sake of simplicity that it was operated
508300	512520	by an all-economy 179-seat 737-900.
512520	516720	We know based on United's company-wide load factor, that 150 of its seats should
516720	517720	be filled.
517720	522840	In this case, their operating cost would total $29,937.
522840	528440	Their total revenue from that flight, however, would be $36,245.
528440	533760	That means the operating profit margin is $6,308.
533760	537280	Imagining again for the sake of simplicity that United sold this hypothetical, perfectly
537280	545200	average flight for either that $199.58 price point or $413.83 price point, that would mean,
545200	551600	to attain their average $36,245 in revenue, they would need to sell 120 of the cheaper
551600	555960	tickets, largely to just leisure travelers, and a mere 30 at the higher price point.
555960	561860	That's just 20% of the overall tickets sold on this flight, but 20% happens to represent
561860	563960	another important statistic.
563960	568520	The average proportion of domestic air travel in the US completed by business travelers.
568520	573160	It's not surprising that these numbers work together so perfectly, because this is the
573160	578500	exact equation United and other business-oriented airlines have been using for decades.
578500	583860	In the case of this hypothetical flight, it's the final 15 passengers—half of the business
583860	587960	travelers—that make up the entirety of the airline's profit.
587960	592360	Now, however, in the COVID era, they're gone.
592360	597600	Southwest Airlines averaged 10.22 cents in operating cost per available seat mile in
597600	603980	2021's second quarter, while United averaged 14.49 cents—a dramatic difference simply
603980	607880	explained by the fact that Southwest is a low-cost airline, meaning its operating costs
607880	610540	are low, and United is not.
610540	615720	In a business environment now devoid of the majority of price inelastic business travelers,
615720	620940	airlines like United have, and will have, a lot harder time keeping up with the recovery.
620940	625580	While United, Delta, and American's revenue recovery all fell behind demand recovery in
625580	632540	the second quarter, Southwest's was on track—67% overall recovery was, in their case, accompanied
632540	636180	by 67.83% revenue recovery.
636180	642700	And now, as August turns into September, recovery is only going to get tougher.
642700	649160	Summer 2021 was one of the busiest on record for many American and European tourist destinations,
649160	651480	but that's coming to an end.
651480	656740	In a normal year, after a summer lull counterbalanced by the busiest leisure travel season, business
656740	661360	travel starts picking up come early September and stays above average through the end of
661360	662360	the year.
662360	666480	This helps stabilize demand during a season when few travel for leisure purposes, but
666480	671000	this year, that's not going to be there, in its full extent.
671000	674920	This abnormally one-sided transition is already happening.
674920	680100	Travel demand in the US dropped 2.8% between the week of July 25th and August 1st, then
680100	682520	another 3% the week of August 8th.
682520	687200	It's a small drop, but there are some initial indications that it's happening faster in
687200	693160	2019, when the first 18 days of August saw 4.2% fewer travelers than the last 18 days
693160	694160	of July.
694160	700040	This year, the difference between those two sets of days is 5.5%.
700040	704560	In absolute terms, that might not seem like a dramatic difference, but in relative terms,
704560	709460	it means the demand drop is happening 30% faster, and these weeks represent only the
709460	713880	very first of leisure travel's end-of-summer retreat.
713880	718440	This trend will likely continue and, more importantly, accelerate as leisure travel
718440	722220	continues to drop and business travel fails to rise.
722220	727300	In the US, the next strong leisure travel period doesn't come until Thanksgiving,
727300	730520	in November, and in Europe, it's Christmas.
730520	735040	And of course, the Delta variant spread surely will not help, as businesses will play it
735040	740280	safe with office openings and corporate travel, now realizing that the path out of the pandemic
740280	742740	is not linear in nature.
742740	746640	For airlines, there's not a whole lot that can be done at this point.
746640	750040	What the world lacks right now is confidence.
750040	754280	In the US, the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, tracking confidence
754280	758940	in the overall state and the economy, recorded one of its largest drops in history between
758940	761520	July and August 2021.
761520	766420	It reached a level of 70.2, which is lower than any point in the pandemic so far, and
766420	769520	its lowest level since the Great Recession.
769520	773960	This is reflective of the amount of uncertainty the Delta variant and its rise in a post-vaccine
773960	778540	era has caused, despite the fact that in the US, Europe, the UK, and other places where
778540	783380	vaccines are now widely available, hospitalizations and deaths are still far from where they were
783380	785840	when consumer sentiment was higher.
785840	790240	Without the certainty of whether the pandemic will worsen or improve in the coming months,
790240	794740	however, businesses will not make the big decisions that will bring business travel
794740	796200	back.
796200	801640	Summer will have likely marked the first profitable period of the pandemic for European and American
801640	805880	airlines, but it seems increasingly unlikely that the recovery will continue its upward
805880	809080	trend in fall without strong business travel.
809080	813720	There's also the question of whether business travel will ever fully recover.
813720	817800	Most experts believe doomsday predictions of Zoom-killing business travel to be overblown,
817800	823040	however, there is a realistic possibility that 2019 could serve as the historical high-water
823040	826880	mark for corporate travel as the world of big business moves increasingly digital and
826880	831960	concerns about the environmental impacts of flying to lunch in another city mount.
831960	837460	If this proves true, subtle changes will occur in the coming years that make United and Lufthansa
837460	840200	look more like Southwest and EasyJet.
840200	845760	COVID should have taught airlines just how important flexibility and adaptability is.
845760	850580	It's hard to fault airlines for failing to turn a profit during the depths of a crisis,
850580	856020	but now, as much of the developed world plots a slow, bumpy path out of the pandemic, there
856020	859000	is opportunity for profitability.
859000	863600	Therefore, this is when the test truly begins.
863600	868460	This is what airlines were waiting for, so now, with cash reserves waned and investor
868460	875940	goodwill gone, the coming months are truly make or break for airlines.
875940	880440	Last year, around when COVID was starting, I decided to basically stop ordering takeout.
880440	885160	I was the kind of person that was so busy that I ordered food almost every single day,
885160	889480	but I eventually realized just how expensive and unhealthy this was.
889480	893480	I was still tight on time, though, so I wanted a relatively easy way to make dinner at the
893480	898360	end of the day that wasn't frozen pizza or ramen, so I found HelloFresh.
898360	901500	I've now used them for about a year and a half, and actually asked them to sponsor
901500	903480	the channel since I was such a fan.
903480	907160	This is all completely true, and I even have the hundreds of recipe cards to prove it,
907160	911020	but if you don't know what they are, HelloFresh sends you a box each week with all the fresh
911020	914520	ingredients you need to make the meals you selected the previous week, and it all comes
914520	919420	in the exact right quantities which cuts down both on prep and shopping time quite a lot.
919420	923620	That way you go straight to cooking, like I did with these tropical teriyaki pork bowls,
923620	925660	which are one of my favorite meals of theirs.
925660	929640	It also turns out that HelloFresh is a more sustainable meals option, as research has
929640	934360	found their carbon footprint is 25% lower than meals from grocery store ingredients,
934360	938400	partially since it cuts down on food waste by sending the exact quantities you need.
938400	943560	Also, getting all these options means I tend to try types of food that I wouldn't normally—it's
943560	946240	a great way to increase variety at dinnertime.
946240	951280	Best of all, you can go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER14 to get 14 free meals
951280	952480	plus free shipping.
