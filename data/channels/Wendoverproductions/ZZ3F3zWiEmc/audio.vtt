00:09.980 --> 00:12.620
into this video's subject.

00:12.620 --> 00:16.900
The first thing to know about the art market is that it's tiny.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.220
Despite its prominence in cinema, literature, and the news, the majority of the market is

00:21.220 --> 00:25.800
composed of a small number of dealers and auctioneers catering to an exclusive list

00:25.800 --> 00:27.820
of ultra-rich clientele.

00:27.820 --> 00:33.560
Each year, on average, $61.9 billion of art is sold.

00:33.560 --> 00:38.480
$61.9 billion is a big number, but not in context.

00:38.480 --> 00:44.440
$61.9 billion is what Walmart, for example, sells in just 41 days.

00:44.440 --> 00:51.000
The global market of tomatoes generates $190 billion in annual sales—three times as much

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
as art.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.320
There are single companies with greater annual sales that you probably haven't even heard

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
of.

00:57.320 --> 01:03.440
NASA, the Centenn Corporation, XOR, the McKesson Corporation—the entire art market is smaller

01:03.440 --> 01:05.120
than each of these.

01:05.120 --> 01:10.680
The second thing to know about the art market is that it's extraordinarily consolidated.

01:10.680 --> 01:17.800
Over the past decade, 82% of sales, by value, were made in the US, UK, or Greater China.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.680
That's to say, the global art market is a phenomenon largely restricted to New York,

01:23.680 --> 01:25.160
London, and Hong Kong.

01:25.160 --> 01:29.000
But the consolidation doesn't end there.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.700
43% of art dealers—nearly half—had fewer than 20 unique buyers in 2020.

01:35.700 --> 01:40.360
Their sale and buyer numbers can be as limited as those of realtors, which starts to make

01:40.360 --> 01:44.120
sense when comparing the sale prices of the two markets.

01:44.120 --> 01:49.560
Unsurprisingly, this means that power in the industry is extraordinarily concentrated,

01:49.560 --> 01:50.560
too.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.760
A study found that 30% of solo exhibitions at museums in the US, considered the hallmark

01:55.760 --> 02:00.880
of success, featured artists represented by one of just five galleries.

02:00.880 --> 02:07.440
Once you move into the upper echelons of the industry, however, the concentration intensifies.

02:07.440 --> 02:12.840
During the studied period, 11 out of 12 solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim, considered one

02:12.840 --> 02:18.500
of the world's preeminent art museums, presented artists represented by one of the same five

02:18.500 --> 02:19.500
galleries.

02:19.500 --> 02:27.300
So, to summarize, the key features of this market are that it is small and concentrated.

02:27.300 --> 02:31.740
Without knowing anything more, an economist could tell you that this is, theoretically,

02:31.740 --> 02:36.020
a market ripe for exploitation and corruption.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.380
But that's just theory.

02:38.380 --> 02:44.260
To understand where the malpractice occurs, one must first understand the practice—how

02:44.260 --> 02:45.980
art sales work.

02:45.980 --> 02:52.900
Only three decades ago, in 1994, artist Roy Lichtenstein put on one of the last solo shows

02:52.900 --> 02:54.280
of his career.

02:54.280 --> 03:00.080
For this, he created a series of nude portraits—a novel subject for Lichtenstein presented in

03:00.080 --> 03:01.700
his archetypical style.

03:01.700 --> 03:07.500
Now, in order to translate his work into income, Lichtenstein partnered with the Leo Castelli

03:07.500 --> 03:08.500
Gallery.

03:08.500 --> 03:12.800
This was no surprise, as Castelli and his gallery had been longtime partners of the

03:12.800 --> 03:14.440
pop art icon.

03:14.440 --> 03:19.580
Three decades prior, Castelli had presented Lichtenstein's first ever one-man show.

03:19.580 --> 03:23.700
The two had formed a professional relationship over the years prior while Lichtenstein worked

03:23.700 --> 03:28.800
as an assistant art professor at Rutgers University, and Castelli believed his work could be a

03:28.800 --> 03:30.720
commercial success.

03:30.720 --> 03:37.520
He was, of course, correct, as every single piece was sold prior to the show's opening.

03:37.520 --> 03:44.200
This skyrocketed Lichtenstein's career—overnight, he was transformed from, essentially, a hobbyist,

03:44.200 --> 03:49.360
into an internationally known, commercially successful, professional artist.

03:49.360 --> 03:55.120
So, for all intents and purposes, Castelli made Lichtenstein.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.440
Therefore, Lichtenstein stuck with Castelli throughout his career, which brought him to

03:59.440 --> 04:05.100
that 1994 exhibition, entitled Nude's Nine-Color Relief Prints.

04:05.100 --> 04:09.240
As is common in the high-end art world, it's difficult to precisely trace the ownership

04:09.240 --> 04:14.120
history of given works, but we know that one of the pieces, Nude with Joy's Painting,

04:14.120 --> 04:18.600
was sold by the Castelli Gallery to a private collector in New York, then sold by the James

04:18.600 --> 04:22.920
Goodman Gallery to a private collector in Detroit, before it was purchased by an unknown

04:22.920 --> 04:24.040
new owner.

04:24.040 --> 04:28.000
That new owner then decided, in 2020, to sell the painting.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.800
Therefore, they contacted Christie's.

04:30.800 --> 04:36.160
Now, Christie's and its primary competitor, Sotheby's, are the big movers and shakers

04:36.160 --> 04:37.320
in the art market.

04:37.320 --> 04:42.200
They're auction houses, and facilitate the sale of much of the world's most expensive

04:42.200 --> 04:43.340
art.

04:43.340 --> 04:50.040
Of the ten highest-priced sales in 2020, eight occurred at either Christie's or Sotheby's.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.700
Their process starts with an appraisal.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.820
Each auction house employs in-house experts who determine what they believe a piece will

04:56.820 --> 05:00.940
sell for, and present a range—a lower number and a higher number.

05:00.940 --> 05:04.980
Then, assuming they want to move forward, the auction house and seller will mutually

05:04.980 --> 05:10.240
agree to a reserve price—a number equal to or less than the lower range of the estimate,

05:10.240 --> 05:14.120
under which they will not sell the piece, even if an offer is submitted.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.840
Typically, with higher-end sales, however, the auction house will persuade the seller

05:17.840 --> 05:22.720
to use their services by guaranteeing the sale—agreeing to purchase the artwork themselves

05:22.720 --> 05:26.840
for the lower end of the estimate, even if no bids are submitted.

05:26.840 --> 05:30.960
On the other end of the spectrum, the auction house takes a 2% fee if a piece of artwork

05:30.960 --> 05:35.600
is sold above the upper estimate to incentivize performance, although this is often waived

05:35.600 --> 05:37.940
in contract negotiations with the seller.

05:37.940 --> 05:42.940
The seller also pays a percentage fee, supposedly as much as 10% for lower-priced works and

05:42.940 --> 05:47.440
as low as 2% for higher-priced works, although official numbers are not published and are

05:47.440 --> 05:52.380
highly subject to negotiation, as auction houses are eager to bring in sellers.

05:52.380 --> 05:55.880
The bulk of the auction house's money is made from the buyer.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.340
They pay, on top of the final sale price, a percentage fee.

05:59.340 --> 06:05.300
At most Christie's auction houses, it's 25% on sales up to $600,000, 20% for sales

06:05.300 --> 06:10.020
up to $6,000,000, then 14.5% on sales above that number.

06:10.020 --> 06:14.480
This is all to say, when Christie's or Sotheby's gets their hands on the kind of artwork that

06:14.480 --> 06:20.280
lists for tens of millions of dollars, they are highly, highly financially motivated to

06:20.280 --> 06:21.740
make the sale.

06:21.740 --> 06:26.720
Roy Lichtenstein's nude-with-joyous painting falls into this category.

06:26.720 --> 06:31.360
A deceased, highly commercially successful artist, a break from style piece created towards

06:31.360 --> 06:36.080
the end of its artist's career, there was a lot going for this painting, and Christie's

06:36.080 --> 06:37.080
knew it.

06:37.080 --> 06:42.880
Therefore, they scheduled its auction to take place at one of the top events of the year.

06:42.880 --> 06:47.760
Under the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, the auction house organized a new format for

06:47.760 --> 06:50.640
one of 2020's biggest auctions.

06:50.640 --> 06:54.820
While each of their auctions typically occur under the banner of one of their locations,

06:54.820 --> 07:00.120
their Hong Kong, Paris, London, and New York auction houses teamed up to run a simultaneous

07:00.120 --> 07:02.400
global, live-streamed auction.

07:02.400 --> 07:08.280
Now, of the 79 lots put up for auction, the absolute least expensive was a piece by Matthew

07:08.280 --> 07:12.520
Wong appraised between $60,000 and $80,000.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.240
Most were well into the millions, and this was by design.

07:16.240 --> 07:20.700
Christie's, Sotheby's, and other auction houses will aggregate their highest-priced

07:20.700 --> 07:25.520
works together into a few yearly auctions, so that they can turn them into can't-miss

07:25.520 --> 07:27.620
events for the art world.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.920
Their job is essentially the marketing.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.520
They're trying to build anticipation and excitement for the sale of a given piece,

07:33.520 --> 07:37.960
so they'll spend the months prior working their catalog of buyers, talking to the press,

07:37.960 --> 07:40.760
and exhibiting works all around the world.

07:40.760 --> 07:47.600
Then, after almost all of their work is completed, the night of the auction arrives.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.760
In this case, the event started with Hong Kong.

07:50.760 --> 07:56.040
Their auctioneer, live-streamed to the world, sold nine relatively lower-priced works before

07:56.040 --> 08:01.200
passing the torch to Paris, from where fifteen higher-priced lots were auctioned.

08:01.200 --> 08:05.680
Then it moved on to London, where hammer prices crept further and further into the millions,

08:05.680 --> 08:08.160
and finally, it was New York's turn.

08:08.160 --> 08:13.660
Saving the best for last, all of the true headliners were auctioned from New York.

08:13.660 --> 08:19.320
This included Picasso's, Basquiat's, Calder's, O'Keeffe's, Warhol's, and of course,

08:19.320 --> 08:20.760
the Lichtenstein.

08:20.760 --> 08:25.320
Bidding opened on nude with joyous painting at $20 million.

08:25.320 --> 08:31.680
That was quickly pushed up to $22, $26, $28, then $29 million.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.840
Two anonymous bidders from New York, aided by phone-laden representatives at the auction

08:35.840 --> 08:40.720
house, pushed the price up by half-million increments to $36, until a buyer from Hong

08:40.720 --> 08:43.920
Kong swooped in and bid $37 million.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.960
One of the New York bidders responded with $38 million, then the other New York bidder

08:47.960 --> 08:49.720
came back with $38.2.

08:49.720 --> 08:59.520
It went to $38.5, $39, $39.5, $40, before the Hong Kong buyer bid $40.5 million, which

08:59.520 --> 09:03.760
meant no response, and the auctioneer's hammer came down on what would become the

09:03.760 --> 09:07.160
third highest-priced art sale of the year.

09:07.160 --> 09:18.480
With fees, the buyer ended up paying $46,242,500, meaning Christie's netted at least $5,742,500

09:18.480 --> 09:22.380
from the 10-minute and 14-second long auction.

09:22.380 --> 09:28.000
Across the evening, though, some $421 million of art was sold.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.480
That means this one four-hour event, and its 79 lots, accounted for almost a full percent

09:34.480 --> 09:40.180
of the entire world's art sales in 2020 by value, and that Christie's, as a company,

09:40.180 --> 09:44.480
earned upwards of $60 million.

09:44.480 --> 09:47.760
So where's the problem?

09:47.760 --> 09:52.320
So far, most of this process probably seems above board—it's just a collection of

09:52.320 --> 09:56.920
wealthy people buying and selling expensive art through a few exclusive auction houses.

09:56.920 --> 10:02.420
Well, it's not so much the process itself, but what it enables.

10:02.420 --> 10:09.200
Most of the issues arise out of a simple truth—art does not have intrinsic value.

10:09.200 --> 10:14.160
Say you stopped by a thrift store, saw this painting on the wall, and it had no label,

10:14.160 --> 10:20.360
no price tag, no information at all beyond the piece itself—how much would you pay

10:20.360 --> 10:21.460
for it?

10:21.460 --> 10:27.140
Some would only spare $20 or $30, while others, impressed with its intricacy and age, might

10:27.140 --> 10:29.560
pay a couple hundred dollars for it.

10:29.560 --> 10:34.680
This is roughly what happened in 1958, when it was presented to a small auction in London

10:34.680 --> 10:40.000
as a poorly maintained copy of a lost work by Leonardo da Vinci, and sold for 45 pounds

10:40.000 --> 10:42.160
to Minnie and Warren Kunz.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.640
The couple carried the painting with them to Southampton, then boarded the ship bound

10:45.640 --> 10:48.840
for Houston to return from their European vacation.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.320
In 1987, the artwork was inherited by Kunz's nephew, Basil Clovis Hendry, who hung it in

10:54.320 --> 10:58.680
his Baton Rouge, Louisiana home until his death in 2004.

10:58.680 --> 11:03.240
His daughter, Susan Hendry Turrell, brought the work, and much of the rest of her father's

11:03.240 --> 11:07.760
estate, to the New Orleans Auction Gallery, where it was listed with a sale estimate of

11:07.760 --> 11:10.320
$1,200 to $1,800.

11:10.320 --> 11:15.160
It was bought for an unknown amount less than $10,000 by a pair of art dealers, Alexander

11:15.160 --> 11:20.600
Parrish and Robert Simon, who had a long-shot hunch that it could be worth far more than

11:20.600 --> 11:21.660
that.

11:21.660 --> 11:25.920
They therefore hired a paintings conservator from NYU to restore the work, and as part

11:25.920 --> 11:30.280
of her process, she took infrared photographs of the piece to be able to see through the

11:30.280 --> 11:32.160
layers of paint.

11:32.160 --> 11:37.120
This unearthed the lowest layer, which included the very first strokes—the ones the artist

11:37.120 --> 11:40.580
took to outline the general composition of the painting.

11:40.580 --> 11:46.420
These first strokes largely matched up with the final product, except for here—the thumb.

11:46.420 --> 11:52.120
They outlined the thumb in a straight position, rather than the curved shape seen in all known

11:52.120 --> 11:55.300
copies of the lost da Vinci painting.

11:55.300 --> 12:02.220
It seemed that the artist changed their mind, which would make no sense when copying a painting.

12:02.220 --> 12:08.140
These few hidden strokes served as a crucial, initial piece of evidence that this might

12:08.140 --> 12:13.700
be the original Salvatore Mundi, painted by Leonardo da Vinci himself.

12:13.700 --> 12:18.980
Therefore, Parrish and Simon spent the better part of the next five years traveling around,

12:18.980 --> 12:23.820
showing the piece to experts and curators, garnering support for their theory.

12:23.820 --> 12:30.100
In 2011, they attained definitive validation—London's National Gallery exhibited the Salvatore

12:30.100 --> 12:34.520
Mundi, and the name on the label read Leonardo da Vinci.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.500
The value instantly skyrocketed.

12:37.500 --> 12:42.140
Parrish and Simon sold the piece to another dealer for $80 million, who immediately sold

12:42.140 --> 12:48.460
it to a Russian collector for $127 million, who then brought the piece to auction.

12:48.460 --> 12:53.540
Only the 24th known painting widely attributed to da Vinci, and one of only two not held

12:53.540 --> 12:59.340
by a museum, this was sure to fetch an eye-popping price.

12:59.340 --> 13:04.220
After a world tour of exhibitions, Leonardo's Salvatore Mundi was sold by Christie's

13:04.220 --> 13:14.620
New York for $450,312,500 to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—an all-time record price

13:14.620 --> 13:17.540
for the sale of a piece of art.

13:17.540 --> 13:23.060
Prior to the recognition by top museums that this piece was, in fact, a da Vinci, the value

13:23.060 --> 13:24.940
was in the low thousands.

13:24.940 --> 13:28.260
After, it was in the hundreds of millions.

13:28.260 --> 13:33.620
That's to say, art has no intrinsic value.

13:33.620 --> 13:38.420
The value for what Christie's, Sotheby's, or other top auction houses sell is all in

13:38.420 --> 13:42.460
who painted it, who owned it, and who wants it.

13:42.460 --> 13:47.340
An uninformed person can look at a car, or a plate of food, or a house, and guess with

13:47.340 --> 13:52.460
some accuracy what it's worth, but that's not the case with art.

13:52.460 --> 13:57.460
Nearly all of the value is invisible, because the value is simply what other people are

13:57.460 --> 13:58.780
willing to pay.

13:58.780 --> 14:04.940
Now, here's the question—would you genuinely believe that if you had bought that dilapidated

14:04.940 --> 14:09.220
portrait of Jesus at the estate auction in New Orleans, you could have successfully convinced

14:09.220 --> 14:12.580
the National Gallery in London that it was a true da Vinci?

14:12.580 --> 14:17.940
Do you believe that if, back in 1960, Roy Lichtenstein had met you, instead of Castelli,

14:17.940 --> 14:21.820
you could have successfully convinced enough people of the artist's future prospects

14:21.820 --> 14:24.780
to sell at his first show prior to opening?

14:24.780 --> 14:28.340
Any answer but no is arrogant.

14:28.340 --> 14:35.260
Value in the art world is defined by an incredibly small number of gatekeepers—the curators,

14:35.260 --> 14:37.220
gallery owners, and auctioneers.

14:37.220 --> 14:43.800
So, to summarize, the art world is an incredibly small, incredibly consolidated market where

14:43.800 --> 14:47.580
prices are almost entirely subjective.

14:47.580 --> 14:54.700
These three factors combined mean that, properly executed, sellers can decide what prices are.

14:54.700 --> 15:01.060
Between 2005 and 2013, one-fourth of all Andy Warhol works put up for auction were

15:01.060 --> 15:04.580
bought by a single man—Jose Mugrabi.

15:04.580 --> 15:10.400
Now, Mugrabi owns over 800 Warhol artworks in total, representing close to a billion

15:10.400 --> 15:13.060
dollars in value—at least on paper.

15:13.060 --> 15:19.620
Therefore, Mugrabi is highly, highly invested in making sure that the Warhol market stays

15:19.620 --> 15:20.620
hot.

15:20.820 --> 15:26.320
Now there is, of course, a reason why in more traditional markets, monopolies and oligopolies

15:26.320 --> 15:27.740
are disallowed.

15:27.740 --> 15:32.660
When power is too concentrated, a single player can influence the entire market to their own

15:32.660 --> 15:33.660
benefit.

15:33.660 --> 15:40.140
That's exactly what Mugrabi does—whenever a Warhol is up for sale at auction, he'll

15:40.140 --> 15:41.140
be there.

15:41.140 --> 15:45.220
Often, Mugrabi will be one of the first to bid, and will work to push up prices with

15:45.220 --> 15:46.580
his early offers.

15:46.580 --> 15:52.300
Mugrabi is more than willing to strategically overpay for a Warhol work because he knows

15:52.300 --> 15:57.100
that it'll be worth it—that's because auctions act as the only publicly available

15:57.100 --> 15:59.420
index of art prices.

15:59.420 --> 16:04.060
When one private individual sells artwork to another private individual, the price is

16:04.060 --> 16:06.580
not public knowledge.

16:06.580 --> 16:12.620
When one private individual sells artwork at auction, the price is public knowledge.

16:12.620 --> 16:17.620
So that means that Mugrabi is willing to go to an auction and bid copiously, regardless

16:17.620 --> 16:20.340
of the actual market value.

16:20.340 --> 16:23.980
Either he'll have pushed up the price for another bidder, which is good for him, or

16:23.980 --> 16:27.340
he'll have overpaid for the art, which is still good for him.

16:27.340 --> 16:32.300
That's because either way, the fact that a Warhol work sold for a good price and the

16:32.300 --> 16:37.820
world knows it pushes up the hypothetical value of the rest of his Warhol pieces, which

16:37.820 --> 16:40.340
he can then sell for more in private.

16:40.380 --> 16:46.380
What's more, this manner of market manipulation is entirely legal.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.300
Collectors will choose a niche, and then dominate it.

16:49.300 --> 16:54.420
Plus, given the small size of the high-end art market, Mugrabi almost certainly knows

16:54.420 --> 16:59.600
all the other top Warhol collectors, and collectively, they realize that if one of them sells a piece

16:59.600 --> 17:04.980
publicly for a bad price, it'll hurt all of their portfolio values, so an informal

17:04.980 --> 17:11.540
social cabal arises that further influences the market and artificially inflates values.

17:11.540 --> 17:15.640
However, this is only the tip of the iceberg.

17:15.640 --> 17:20.860
The same market conditions that enable Mugrabi's influence mean that collusion and corruption

17:20.860 --> 17:23.340
are confoundingly easy.

17:23.340 --> 17:27.940
There isn't one blockbuster scam at the center of the art market.

17:27.940 --> 17:32.380
Rather, it's a market composed of scams.

17:32.380 --> 17:37.760
For example, counter-intuitively, wealthy individuals can turn a profit by donating

17:37.760 --> 17:38.760
art.

17:38.760 --> 17:44.020
It's rather simple—in the US, when one donates artwork to a non-profit museum, they

17:44.020 --> 17:45.020
get a tax write-off.

17:45.020 --> 17:50.720
That's to say, if someone donates a painting worth $10 million, they don't have to pay

17:50.720 --> 17:56.860
taxes on $10 million of income, which, in theory, would save them about $4 million.

17:56.860 --> 18:01.660
Of course, given the difficulties in determining art's worth, the IRS requires expensive

18:01.660 --> 18:05.300
artwork to be professionally appraised prior to a write-off.

18:05.300 --> 18:09.580
Considering all the aforementioned market conditions, though, it's not tough to manipulate

18:09.580 --> 18:12.200
an appraisal to go one's way.

18:12.200 --> 18:17.740
Of the hundreds of thousands of artworks donated each year, the IRS audits only a couple hundred,

18:17.740 --> 18:20.720
but even those few paint a stark picture.

18:20.720 --> 18:26.460
In 2018 and 2019, about a third of audited artwork was found to be overvalued in its

18:26.460 --> 18:29.980
appraisal by an average of 38%.

18:29.980 --> 18:35.380
In fact, overall, only 42% of artwork was found to have been appraised correctly, in

18:35.380 --> 18:39.420
part thanks to the competing pressure for some to undervalue their work when it's

18:39.420 --> 18:43.380
received through inheritance, in order to reduce the estate taxes paid upon transfer

18:43.380 --> 18:44.380
of ownership.

18:44.380 --> 18:49.660
So, a rich person could buy a piece of art for $4 million, let it appreciate over a few

18:49.660 --> 18:54.380
years, shop around for a favorable appraisal, overstate its value, rely on the fact that

18:54.380 --> 18:59.620
the IRS only audits a tiny percentage of prices, donate the art for $10 million, and they'll

18:59.620 --> 19:01.380
have already broken even.

19:01.380 --> 19:06.420
It doesn't take much for the percentage a wealthy person will save in taxes to eclipse

19:06.420 --> 19:10.500
their original purchase price—as a cherry on top, of course.

19:10.500 --> 19:14.900
The presence of an artist's work in a museum is known to inflate the value of their other

19:14.900 --> 19:20.020
art, so if a wealthy person owns a collection of a given artist's work, as is common,

19:20.020 --> 19:24.420
donations earn them further money through the effect it has on the rest of their collection.

19:24.420 --> 19:30.580
In aggregate, the situation is this—it was created by rich people, for rich people,

19:30.580 --> 19:33.060
so it suits their needs.

19:33.060 --> 19:38.860
Whether it's tax avoidance, money laundering, or simple price fixing, the art market enables

19:38.860 --> 19:40.100
all.

19:40.100 --> 19:43.740
Despite this, it's almost entirely unregulated.

19:43.740 --> 19:48.560
There are no official records of who owns what or how much they paid, so it's nearly

19:48.560 --> 19:52.020
impossible to prove any malpractice in the market.

19:52.020 --> 19:57.060
It's a largely lawless market, except for the simple, practical rule that you must be

19:57.060 --> 20:00.020
able to spend millions to enter it.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.140
So, who loses out?

20:02.140 --> 20:05.060
Well, for one, artists.

20:05.060 --> 20:10.100
Rich people use artwork like trading cards, coveting a select few for arbitrary reasons,

20:10.100 --> 20:14.660
which excludes those who are unable to persuade the gatekeepers of their value—those who

20:14.660 --> 20:18.420
don't fit the gallery's vision of a marketable artist.

20:18.420 --> 20:22.660
Art is no longer an exercise of skill—it's one of branding.

20:22.660 --> 20:27.420
Warhols are like Supreme, but for the wealthiest percent of a percent.

20:27.420 --> 20:32.920
Who also loses out is us—everyone who is unable to access this exclusive market by

20:32.920 --> 20:37.020
sinking millions of dollars into a single, volatile investment.

20:37.020 --> 20:42.340
We lose out because we can't conduct the same financial wizardry as those who walk

20:42.340 --> 20:44.460
through Sotheby's doors.

20:44.500 --> 20:48.940
We can access the stock market, where tax avoidance, money laundering, and price fixing

20:48.940 --> 20:53.980
are heavily regulated and monitored, but not this market, where these ruses go largely

20:53.980 --> 20:55.500
unnoticed.

20:55.500 --> 21:01.120
The reality is that any market can be exploited, which is why markets are regulated.

21:01.120 --> 21:06.500
The difference here is that art is a unique market where individual players have both

21:06.500 --> 21:13.620
the influence to manipulate the market, and the influence to keep the market manipulatable.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.220
Something you've heard so far is about the largely legal malpractice the art market

21:17.220 --> 21:22.380
enables, but it also makes illegal actions like money laundering and forgery strikingly

21:22.380 --> 21:23.380
easy.

21:23.380 --> 21:28.480
Therefore, as usual, I made an exclusive Nebula companion video diving deeper into that subject

21:28.480 --> 21:31.260
for those who found this video particularly interesting.

21:31.260 --> 21:35.940
I was able to do that because Nebula, unlike YouTube, has no algorithm to punish me for

21:35.940 --> 21:39.940
publishing a video that only the most engaged viewers are going to be interested in.

21:40.260 --> 21:44.020
Nebula was founded and is owned by creators, so it's made to be the best home to our

21:44.020 --> 21:48.820
content, with no ads and a financial model that enables exclusive companion videos and

21:48.820 --> 21:50.300
big-budget Nebula originals.

21:50.300 --> 21:54.340
We've also made sure that Nebula is the absolute best deal in the streaming world

the true story of a famed British actor who dropped everything to join the fight against

22:19.740 --> 22:21.500
ISIS in Syria.

22:21.500 --> 22:26.220
