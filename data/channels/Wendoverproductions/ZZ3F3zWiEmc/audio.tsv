9980	12620	into this video's subject.
12620	16900	The first thing to know about the art market is that it's tiny.
16900	21220	Despite its prominence in cinema, literature, and the news, the majority of the market is
21220	25800	composed of a small number of dealers and auctioneers catering to an exclusive list
25800	27820	of ultra-rich clientele.
27820	33560	Each year, on average, $61.9 billion of art is sold.
33560	38480	$61.9 billion is a big number, but not in context.
38480	44440	$61.9 billion is what Walmart, for example, sells in just 41 days.
44440	51000	The global market of tomatoes generates $190 billion in annual sales—three times as much
51000	52000	as art.
52000	56320	There are single companies with greater annual sales that you probably haven't even heard
56320	57320	of.
57320	63440	NASA, the Centenn Corporation, XOR, the McKesson Corporation—the entire art market is smaller
63440	65120	than each of these.
65120	70680	The second thing to know about the art market is that it's extraordinarily consolidated.
70680	77800	Over the past decade, 82% of sales, by value, were made in the US, UK, or Greater China.
77800	83680	That's to say, the global art market is a phenomenon largely restricted to New York,
83680	85160	London, and Hong Kong.
85160	89000	But the consolidation doesn't end there.
89000	95700	43% of art dealers—nearly half—had fewer than 20 unique buyers in 2020.
95700	100360	Their sale and buyer numbers can be as limited as those of realtors, which starts to make
100360	104120	sense when comparing the sale prices of the two markets.
104120	109560	Unsurprisingly, this means that power in the industry is extraordinarily concentrated,
109560	110560	too.
110560	115760	A study found that 30% of solo exhibitions at museums in the US, considered the hallmark
115760	120880	of success, featured artists represented by one of just five galleries.
120880	127440	Once you move into the upper echelons of the industry, however, the concentration intensifies.
127440	132840	During the studied period, 11 out of 12 solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim, considered one
132840	138500	of the world's preeminent art museums, presented artists represented by one of the same five
138500	139500	galleries.
139500	147300	So, to summarize, the key features of this market are that it is small and concentrated.
147300	151740	Without knowing anything more, an economist could tell you that this is, theoretically,
151740	156020	a market ripe for exploitation and corruption.
156020	158380	But that's just theory.
158380	164260	To understand where the malpractice occurs, one must first understand the practice—how
164260	165980	art sales work.
165980	172900	Only three decades ago, in 1994, artist Roy Lichtenstein put on one of the last solo shows
172900	174280	of his career.
174280	180080	For this, he created a series of nude portraits—a novel subject for Lichtenstein presented in
180080	181700	his archetypical style.
181700	187500	Now, in order to translate his work into income, Lichtenstein partnered with the Leo Castelli
187500	188500	Gallery.
188500	192800	This was no surprise, as Castelli and his gallery had been longtime partners of the
192800	194440	pop art icon.
194440	199580	Three decades prior, Castelli had presented Lichtenstein's first ever one-man show.
199580	203700	The two had formed a professional relationship over the years prior while Lichtenstein worked
203700	208800	as an assistant art professor at Rutgers University, and Castelli believed his work could be a
208800	210720	commercial success.
210720	217520	He was, of course, correct, as every single piece was sold prior to the show's opening.
217520	224200	This skyrocketed Lichtenstein's career—overnight, he was transformed from, essentially, a hobbyist,
224200	229360	into an internationally known, commercially successful, professional artist.
229360	235120	So, for all intents and purposes, Castelli made Lichtenstein.
235120	239440	Therefore, Lichtenstein stuck with Castelli throughout his career, which brought him to
239440	245100	that 1994 exhibition, entitled Nude's Nine-Color Relief Prints.
245100	249240	As is common in the high-end art world, it's difficult to precisely trace the ownership
249240	254120	history of given works, but we know that one of the pieces, Nude with Joy's Painting,
254120	258600	was sold by the Castelli Gallery to a private collector in New York, then sold by the James
258600	262920	Goodman Gallery to a private collector in Detroit, before it was purchased by an unknown
262920	264040	new owner.
264040	268000	That new owner then decided, in 2020, to sell the painting.
268000	270800	Therefore, they contacted Christie's.
270800	276160	Now, Christie's and its primary competitor, Sotheby's, are the big movers and shakers
276160	277320	in the art market.
277320	282200	They're auction houses, and facilitate the sale of much of the world's most expensive
282200	283340	art.
283340	290040	Of the ten highest-priced sales in 2020, eight occurred at either Christie's or Sotheby's.
290040	292700	Their process starts with an appraisal.
292700	296820	Each auction house employs in-house experts who determine what they believe a piece will
296820	300940	sell for, and present a range—a lower number and a higher number.
300940	304980	Then, assuming they want to move forward, the auction house and seller will mutually
304980	310240	agree to a reserve price—a number equal to or less than the lower range of the estimate,
310240	314120	under which they will not sell the piece, even if an offer is submitted.
314120	317840	Typically, with higher-end sales, however, the auction house will persuade the seller
317840	322720	to use their services by guaranteeing the sale—agreeing to purchase the artwork themselves
322720	326840	for the lower end of the estimate, even if no bids are submitted.
326840	330960	On the other end of the spectrum, the auction house takes a 2% fee if a piece of artwork
330960	335600	is sold above the upper estimate to incentivize performance, although this is often waived
335600	337940	in contract negotiations with the seller.
337940	342940	The seller also pays a percentage fee, supposedly as much as 10% for lower-priced works and
342940	347440	as low as 2% for higher-priced works, although official numbers are not published and are
347440	352380	highly subject to negotiation, as auction houses are eager to bring in sellers.
352380	355880	The bulk of the auction house's money is made from the buyer.
355880	359340	They pay, on top of the final sale price, a percentage fee.
359340	365300	At most Christie's auction houses, it's 25% on sales up to $600,000, 20% for sales
365300	370020	up to $6,000,000, then 14.5% on sales above that number.
370020	374480	This is all to say, when Christie's or Sotheby's gets their hands on the kind of artwork that
374480	380280	lists for tens of millions of dollars, they are highly, highly financially motivated to
380280	381740	make the sale.
381740	386720	Roy Lichtenstein's nude-with-joyous painting falls into this category.
386720	391360	A deceased, highly commercially successful artist, a break from style piece created towards
391360	396080	the end of its artist's career, there was a lot going for this painting, and Christie's
396080	397080	knew it.
397080	402880	Therefore, they scheduled its auction to take place at one of the top events of the year.
402880	407760	Under the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, the auction house organized a new format for
407760	410640	one of 2020's biggest auctions.
410640	414820	While each of their auctions typically occur under the banner of one of their locations,
414820	420120	their Hong Kong, Paris, London, and New York auction houses teamed up to run a simultaneous
420120	422400	global, live-streamed auction.
422400	428280	Now, of the 79 lots put up for auction, the absolute least expensive was a piece by Matthew
428280	432520	Wong appraised between $60,000 and $80,000.
432520	436240	Most were well into the millions, and this was by design.
436240	440700	Christie's, Sotheby's, and other auction houses will aggregate their highest-priced
440700	445520	works together into a few yearly auctions, so that they can turn them into can't-miss
445520	447620	events for the art world.
447620	449920	Their job is essentially the marketing.
449920	453520	They're trying to build anticipation and excitement for the sale of a given piece,
453520	457960	so they'll spend the months prior working their catalog of buyers, talking to the press,
457960	460760	and exhibiting works all around the world.
460760	467600	Then, after almost all of their work is completed, the night of the auction arrives.
467600	470760	In this case, the event started with Hong Kong.
470760	476040	Their auctioneer, live-streamed to the world, sold nine relatively lower-priced works before
476040	481200	passing the torch to Paris, from where fifteen higher-priced lots were auctioned.
481200	485680	Then it moved on to London, where hammer prices crept further and further into the millions,
485680	488160	and finally, it was New York's turn.
488160	493660	Saving the best for last, all of the true headliners were auctioned from New York.
493660	499320	This included Picasso's, Basquiat's, Calder's, O'Keeffe's, Warhol's, and of course,
499320	500760	the Lichtenstein.
500760	505320	Bidding opened on nude with joyous painting at $20 million.
505320	511680	That was quickly pushed up to $22, $26, $28, then $29 million.
511680	515840	Two anonymous bidders from New York, aided by phone-laden representatives at the auction
515840	520720	house, pushed the price up by half-million increments to $36, until a buyer from Hong
520720	523920	Kong swooped in and bid $37 million.
523920	527960	One of the New York bidders responded with $38 million, then the other New York bidder
527960	529720	came back with $38.2.
529720	539520	It went to $38.5, $39, $39.5, $40, before the Hong Kong buyer bid $40.5 million, which
539520	543760	meant no response, and the auctioneer's hammer came down on what would become the
543760	547160	third highest-priced art sale of the year.
547160	558480	With fees, the buyer ended up paying $46,242,500, meaning Christie's netted at least $5,742,500
558480	562380	from the 10-minute and 14-second long auction.
562380	568000	Across the evening, though, some $421 million of art was sold.
568000	574480	That means this one four-hour event, and its 79 lots, accounted for almost a full percent
574480	580180	of the entire world's art sales in 2020 by value, and that Christie's, as a company,
580180	584480	earned upwards of $60 million.
584480	587760	So where's the problem?
587760	592320	So far, most of this process probably seems above board—it's just a collection of
592320	596920	wealthy people buying and selling expensive art through a few exclusive auction houses.
596920	602420	Well, it's not so much the process itself, but what it enables.
602420	609200	Most of the issues arise out of a simple truth—art does not have intrinsic value.
609200	614160	Say you stopped by a thrift store, saw this painting on the wall, and it had no label,
614160	620360	no price tag, no information at all beyond the piece itself—how much would you pay
620360	621460	for it?
621460	627140	Some would only spare $20 or $30, while others, impressed with its intricacy and age, might
627140	629560	pay a couple hundred dollars for it.
629560	634680	This is roughly what happened in 1958, when it was presented to a small auction in London
634680	640000	as a poorly maintained copy of a lost work by Leonardo da Vinci, and sold for 45 pounds
640000	642160	to Minnie and Warren Kunz.
642160	645640	The couple carried the painting with them to Southampton, then boarded the ship bound
645640	648840	for Houston to return from their European vacation.
648840	654320	In 1987, the artwork was inherited by Kunz's nephew, Basil Clovis Hendry, who hung it in
654320	658680	his Baton Rouge, Louisiana home until his death in 2004.
658680	663240	His daughter, Susan Hendry Turrell, brought the work, and much of the rest of her father's
663240	667760	estate, to the New Orleans Auction Gallery, where it was listed with a sale estimate of
667760	670320	$1,200 to $1,800.
670320	675160	It was bought for an unknown amount less than $10,000 by a pair of art dealers, Alexander
675160	680600	Parrish and Robert Simon, who had a long-shot hunch that it could be worth far more than
680600	681660	that.
681660	685920	They therefore hired a paintings conservator from NYU to restore the work, and as part
685920	690280	of her process, she took infrared photographs of the piece to be able to see through the
690280	692160	layers of paint.
692160	697120	This unearthed the lowest layer, which included the very first strokes—the ones the artist
697120	700580	took to outline the general composition of the painting.
700580	706420	These first strokes largely matched up with the final product, except for here—the thumb.
706420	712120	They outlined the thumb in a straight position, rather than the curved shape seen in all known
712120	715300	copies of the lost da Vinci painting.
715300	722220	It seemed that the artist changed their mind, which would make no sense when copying a painting.
722220	728140	These few hidden strokes served as a crucial, initial piece of evidence that this might
728140	733700	be the original Salvatore Mundi, painted by Leonardo da Vinci himself.
733700	738980	Therefore, Parrish and Simon spent the better part of the next five years traveling around,
738980	743820	showing the piece to experts and curators, garnering support for their theory.
743820	750100	In 2011, they attained definitive validation—London's National Gallery exhibited the Salvatore
750100	754520	Mundi, and the name on the label read Leonardo da Vinci.
754520	757500	The value instantly skyrocketed.
757500	762140	Parrish and Simon sold the piece to another dealer for $80 million, who immediately sold
762140	768460	it to a Russian collector for $127 million, who then brought the piece to auction.
768460	773540	Only the 24th known painting widely attributed to da Vinci, and one of only two not held
773540	779340	by a museum, this was sure to fetch an eye-popping price.
779340	784220	After a world tour of exhibitions, Leonardo's Salvatore Mundi was sold by Christie's
784220	794620	New York for $450,312,500 to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—an all-time record price
794620	797540	for the sale of a piece of art.
797540	803060	Prior to the recognition by top museums that this piece was, in fact, a da Vinci, the value
803060	804940	was in the low thousands.
804940	808260	After, it was in the hundreds of millions.
808260	813620	That's to say, art has no intrinsic value.
813620	818420	The value for what Christie's, Sotheby's, or other top auction houses sell is all in
818420	822460	who painted it, who owned it, and who wants it.
822460	827340	An uninformed person can look at a car, or a plate of food, or a house, and guess with
827340	832460	some accuracy what it's worth, but that's not the case with art.
832460	837460	Nearly all of the value is invisible, because the value is simply what other people are
837460	838780	willing to pay.
838780	844940	Now, here's the question—would you genuinely believe that if you had bought that dilapidated
844940	849220	portrait of Jesus at the estate auction in New Orleans, you could have successfully convinced
849220	852580	the National Gallery in London that it was a true da Vinci?
852580	857940	Do you believe that if, back in 1960, Roy Lichtenstein had met you, instead of Castelli,
857940	861820	you could have successfully convinced enough people of the artist's future prospects
861820	864780	to sell at his first show prior to opening?
864780	868340	Any answer but no is arrogant.
868340	875260	Value in the art world is defined by an incredibly small number of gatekeepers—the curators,
875260	877220	gallery owners, and auctioneers.
877220	883800	So, to summarize, the art world is an incredibly small, incredibly consolidated market where
883800	887580	prices are almost entirely subjective.
887580	894700	These three factors combined mean that, properly executed, sellers can decide what prices are.
894700	901060	Between 2005 and 2013, one-fourth of all Andy Warhol works put up for auction were
901060	904580	bought by a single man—Jose Mugrabi.
904580	910400	Now, Mugrabi owns over 800 Warhol artworks in total, representing close to a billion
910400	913060	dollars in value—at least on paper.
913060	919620	Therefore, Mugrabi is highly, highly invested in making sure that the Warhol market stays
919620	920620	hot.
920820	926320	Now there is, of course, a reason why in more traditional markets, monopolies and oligopolies
926320	927740	are disallowed.
927740	932660	When power is too concentrated, a single player can influence the entire market to their own
932660	933660	benefit.
933660	940140	That's exactly what Mugrabi does—whenever a Warhol is up for sale at auction, he'll
940140	941140	be there.
941140	945220	Often, Mugrabi will be one of the first to bid, and will work to push up prices with
945220	946580	his early offers.
946580	952300	Mugrabi is more than willing to strategically overpay for a Warhol work because he knows
952300	957100	that it'll be worth it—that's because auctions act as the only publicly available
957100	959420	index of art prices.
959420	964060	When one private individual sells artwork to another private individual, the price is
964060	966580	not public knowledge.
966580	972620	When one private individual sells artwork at auction, the price is public knowledge.
972620	977620	So that means that Mugrabi is willing to go to an auction and bid copiously, regardless
977620	980340	of the actual market value.
980340	983980	Either he'll have pushed up the price for another bidder, which is good for him, or
983980	987340	he'll have overpaid for the art, which is still good for him.
987340	992300	That's because either way, the fact that a Warhol work sold for a good price and the
992300	997820	world knows it pushes up the hypothetical value of the rest of his Warhol pieces, which
997820	1000340	he can then sell for more in private.
1000380	1006380	What's more, this manner of market manipulation is entirely legal.
1006380	1009300	Collectors will choose a niche, and then dominate it.
1009300	1014420	Plus, given the small size of the high-end art market, Mugrabi almost certainly knows
1014420	1019600	all the other top Warhol collectors, and collectively, they realize that if one of them sells a piece
1019600	1024980	publicly for a bad price, it'll hurt all of their portfolio values, so an informal
1024980	1031540	social cabal arises that further influences the market and artificially inflates values.
1031540	1035640	However, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
1035640	1040860	The same market conditions that enable Mugrabi's influence mean that collusion and corruption
1040860	1043340	are confoundingly easy.
1043340	1047940	There isn't one blockbuster scam at the center of the art market.
1047940	1052380	Rather, it's a market composed of scams.
1052380	1057760	For example, counter-intuitively, wealthy individuals can turn a profit by donating
1057760	1058760	art.
1058760	1064020	It's rather simple—in the US, when one donates artwork to a non-profit museum, they
1064020	1065020	get a tax write-off.
1065020	1070720	That's to say, if someone donates a painting worth $10 million, they don't have to pay
1070720	1076860	taxes on $10 million of income, which, in theory, would save them about $4 million.
1076860	1081660	Of course, given the difficulties in determining art's worth, the IRS requires expensive
1081660	1085300	artwork to be professionally appraised prior to a write-off.
1085300	1089580	Considering all the aforementioned market conditions, though, it's not tough to manipulate
1089580	1092200	an appraisal to go one's way.
1092200	1097740	Of the hundreds of thousands of artworks donated each year, the IRS audits only a couple hundred,
1097740	1100720	but even those few paint a stark picture.
1100720	1106460	In 2018 and 2019, about a third of audited artwork was found to be overvalued in its
1106460	1109980	appraisal by an average of 38%.
1109980	1115380	In fact, overall, only 42% of artwork was found to have been appraised correctly, in
1115380	1119420	part thanks to the competing pressure for some to undervalue their work when it's
1119420	1123380	received through inheritance, in order to reduce the estate taxes paid upon transfer
1123380	1124380	of ownership.
1124380	1129660	So, a rich person could buy a piece of art for $4 million, let it appreciate over a few
1129660	1134380	years, shop around for a favorable appraisal, overstate its value, rely on the fact that
1134380	1139620	the IRS only audits a tiny percentage of prices, donate the art for $10 million, and they'll
1139620	1141380	have already broken even.
1141380	1146420	It doesn't take much for the percentage a wealthy person will save in taxes to eclipse
1146420	1150500	their original purchase price—as a cherry on top, of course.
1150500	1154900	The presence of an artist's work in a museum is known to inflate the value of their other
1154900	1160020	art, so if a wealthy person owns a collection of a given artist's work, as is common,
1160020	1164420	donations earn them further money through the effect it has on the rest of their collection.
1164420	1170580	In aggregate, the situation is this—it was created by rich people, for rich people,
1170580	1173060	so it suits their needs.
1173060	1178860	Whether it's tax avoidance, money laundering, or simple price fixing, the art market enables
1178860	1180100	all.
1180100	1183740	Despite this, it's almost entirely unregulated.
1183740	1188560	There are no official records of who owns what or how much they paid, so it's nearly
1188560	1192020	impossible to prove any malpractice in the market.
1192020	1197060	It's a largely lawless market, except for the simple, practical rule that you must be
1197060	1200020	able to spend millions to enter it.
1200020	1202140	So, who loses out?
1202140	1205060	Well, for one, artists.
1205060	1210100	Rich people use artwork like trading cards, coveting a select few for arbitrary reasons,
1210100	1214660	which excludes those who are unable to persuade the gatekeepers of their value—those who
1214660	1218420	don't fit the gallery's vision of a marketable artist.
1218420	1222660	Art is no longer an exercise of skill—it's one of branding.
1222660	1227420	Warhols are like Supreme, but for the wealthiest percent of a percent.
1227420	1232920	Who also loses out is us—everyone who is unable to access this exclusive market by
1232920	1237020	sinking millions of dollars into a single, volatile investment.
1237020	1242340	We lose out because we can't conduct the same financial wizardry as those who walk
1242340	1244460	through Sotheby's doors.
1244500	1248940	We can access the stock market, where tax avoidance, money laundering, and price fixing
1248940	1253980	are heavily regulated and monitored, but not this market, where these ruses go largely
1253980	1255500	unnoticed.
1255500	1261120	The reality is that any market can be exploited, which is why markets are regulated.
1261120	1266500	The difference here is that art is a unique market where individual players have both
1266500	1273620	the influence to manipulate the market, and the influence to keep the market manipulatable.
1273620	1277220	Something you've heard so far is about the largely legal malpractice the art market
1277220	1282380	enables, but it also makes illegal actions like money laundering and forgery strikingly
1282380	1283380	easy.
1283380	1288480	Therefore, as usual, I made an exclusive Nebula companion video diving deeper into that subject
1288480	1291260	for those who found this video particularly interesting.
1291260	1295940	I was able to do that because Nebula, unlike YouTube, has no algorithm to punish me for
1295940	1299940	publishing a video that only the most engaged viewers are going to be interested in.
1300260	1304020	Nebula was founded and is owned by creators, so it's made to be the best home to our
1304020	1308820	content, with no ads and a financial model that enables exclusive companion videos and
1308820	1310300	big-budget Nebula originals.
