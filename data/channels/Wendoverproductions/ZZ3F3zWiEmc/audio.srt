3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,620
into this video's subject.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:16,900
The first thing to know about the art market is that it's tiny.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,220
Despite its prominence in cinema, literature, and the news, the majority of the market is

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,800
composed of a small number of dealers and auctioneers catering to an exclusive list

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,820
of ultra-rich clientele.

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:33,560
Each year, on average, $61.9 billion of art is sold.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,480
$61.9 billion is a big number, but not in context.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,440
$61.9 billion is what Walmart, for example, sells in just 41 days.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,000
The global market of tomatoes generates $190 billion in annual sales—three times as much

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
as art.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,320
There are single companies with greater annual sales that you probably haven't even heard

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
of.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,440
NASA, the Centenn Corporation, XOR, the McKesson Corporation—the entire art market is smaller

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,120
than each of these.

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,680
The second thing to know about the art market is that it's extraordinarily consolidated.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,800
Over the past decade, 82% of sales, by value, were made in the US, UK, or Greater China.

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,680
That's to say, the global art market is a phenomenon largely restricted to New York,

20
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,160
London, and Hong Kong.

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,000
But the consolidation doesn't end there.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,700
43% of art dealers—nearly half—had fewer than 20 unique buyers in 2020.

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,360
Their sale and buyer numbers can be as limited as those of realtors, which starts to make

24
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,120
sense when comparing the sale prices of the two markets.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,560
Unsurprisingly, this means that power in the industry is extraordinarily concentrated,

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
too.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,760
A study found that 30% of solo exhibitions at museums in the US, considered the hallmark

28
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,880
of success, featured artists represented by one of just five galleries.

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,440
Once you move into the upper echelons of the industry, however, the concentration intensifies.

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,840
During the studied period, 11 out of 12 solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim, considered one

31
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,500
of the world's preeminent art museums, presented artists represented by one of the same five

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,500
galleries.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,300
So, to summarize, the key features of this market are that it is small and concentrated.

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,740
Without knowing anything more, an economist could tell you that this is, theoretically,

35
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,020
a market ripe for exploitation and corruption.

36
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,380
But that's just theory.

37
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:44,260
To understand where the malpractice occurs, one must first understand the practice—how

38
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,980
art sales work.

39
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:52,900
Only three decades ago, in 1994, artist Roy Lichtenstein put on one of the last solo shows

40
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,280
of his career.

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,080
For this, he created a series of nude portraits—a novel subject for Lichtenstein presented in

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,700
his archetypical style.

43
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,500
Now, in order to translate his work into income, Lichtenstein partnered with the Leo Castelli

44
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Gallery.

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,800
This was no surprise, as Castelli and his gallery had been longtime partners of the

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,440
pop art icon.

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,580
Three decades prior, Castelli had presented Lichtenstein's first ever one-man show.

48
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,700
The two had formed a professional relationship over the years prior while Lichtenstein worked

49
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,800
as an assistant art professor at Rutgers University, and Castelli believed his work could be a

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,720
commercial success.

51
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,520
He was, of course, correct, as every single piece was sold prior to the show's opening.

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,200
This skyrocketed Lichtenstein's career—overnight, he was transformed from, essentially, a hobbyist,

53
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,360
into an internationally known, commercially successful, professional artist.

54
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,120
So, for all intents and purposes, Castelli made Lichtenstein.

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,440
Therefore, Lichtenstein stuck with Castelli throughout his career, which brought him to

56
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,100
that 1994 exhibition, entitled Nude's Nine-Color Relief Prints.

57
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,240
As is common in the high-end art world, it's difficult to precisely trace the ownership

58
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,120
history of given works, but we know that one of the pieces, Nude with Joy's Painting,

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,600
was sold by the Castelli Gallery to a private collector in New York, then sold by the James

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,920
Goodman Gallery to a private collector in Detroit, before it was purchased by an unknown

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,040
new owner.

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,000
That new owner then decided, in 2020, to sell the painting.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Therefore, they contacted Christie's.

64
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,160
Now, Christie's and its primary competitor, Sotheby's, are the big movers and shakers

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,320
in the art market.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,200
They're auction houses, and facilitate the sale of much of the world's most expensive

67
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,340
art.

68
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:50,040
Of the ten highest-priced sales in 2020, eight occurred at either Christie's or Sotheby's.

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,700
Their process starts with an appraisal.

70
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,820
Each auction house employs in-house experts who determine what they believe a piece will

71
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,940
sell for, and present a range—a lower number and a higher number.

72
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,980
Then, assuming they want to move forward, the auction house and seller will mutually

73
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,240
agree to a reserve price—a number equal to or less than the lower range of the estimate,

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,120
under which they will not sell the piece, even if an offer is submitted.

75
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,840
Typically, with higher-end sales, however, the auction house will persuade the seller

76
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,720
to use their services by guaranteeing the sale—agreeing to purchase the artwork themselves

77
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,840
for the lower end of the estimate, even if no bids are submitted.

78
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,960
On the other end of the spectrum, the auction house takes a 2% fee if a piece of artwork

79
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,600
is sold above the upper estimate to incentivize performance, although this is often waived

80
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,940
in contract negotiations with the seller.

81
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,940
The seller also pays a percentage fee, supposedly as much as 10% for lower-priced works and

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,440
as low as 2% for higher-priced works, although official numbers are not published and are

83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,380
highly subject to negotiation, as auction houses are eager to bring in sellers.

84
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,880
The bulk of the auction house's money is made from the buyer.

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,340
They pay, on top of the final sale price, a percentage fee.

86
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:05,300
At most Christie's auction houses, it's 25% on sales up to $600,000, 20% for sales

87
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,020
up to $6,000,000, then 14.5% on sales above that number.

88
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,480
This is all to say, when Christie's or Sotheby's gets their hands on the kind of artwork that

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,280
lists for tens of millions of dollars, they are highly, highly financially motivated to

90
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,740
make the sale.

91
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,720
Roy Lichtenstein's nude-with-joyous painting falls into this category.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,360
A deceased, highly commercially successful artist, a break from style piece created towards

93
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,080
the end of its artist's career, there was a lot going for this painting, and Christie's

94
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
knew it.

95
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:42,880
Therefore, they scheduled its auction to take place at one of the top events of the year.

96
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,760
Under the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic, the auction house organized a new format for

97
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,640
one of 2020's biggest auctions.

98
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,820
While each of their auctions typically occur under the banner of one of their locations,

99
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,120
their Hong Kong, Paris, London, and New York auction houses teamed up to run a simultaneous

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
global, live-streamed auction.

101
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,280
Now, of the 79 lots put up for auction, the absolute least expensive was a piece by Matthew

102
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,520
Wong appraised between $60,000 and $80,000.

103
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,240
Most were well into the millions, and this was by design.

104
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,700
Christie's, Sotheby's, and other auction houses will aggregate their highest-priced

105
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,520
works together into a few yearly auctions, so that they can turn them into can't-miss

106
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,620
events for the art world.

107
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,920
Their job is essentially the marketing.

108
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,520
They're trying to build anticipation and excitement for the sale of a given piece,

109
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,960
so they'll spend the months prior working their catalog of buyers, talking to the press,

110
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,760
and exhibiting works all around the world.

111
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,600
Then, after almost all of their work is completed, the night of the auction arrives.

112
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,760
In this case, the event started with Hong Kong.

113
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,040
Their auctioneer, live-streamed to the world, sold nine relatively lower-priced works before

114
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,200
passing the torch to Paris, from where fifteen higher-priced lots were auctioned.

115
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,680
Then it moved on to London, where hammer prices crept further and further into the millions,

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,160
and finally, it was New York's turn.

117
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,660
Saving the best for last, all of the true headliners were auctioned from New York.

118
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,320
This included Picasso's, Basquiat's, Calder's, O'Keeffe's, Warhol's, and of course,

119
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,760
the Lichtenstein.

120
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,320
Bidding opened on nude with joyous painting at $20 million.

121
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,680
That was quickly pushed up to $22, $26, $28, then $29 million.

122
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,840
Two anonymous bidders from New York, aided by phone-laden representatives at the auction

123
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,720
house, pushed the price up by half-million increments to $36, until a buyer from Hong

124
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,920
Kong swooped in and bid $37 million.

125
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,960
One of the New York bidders responded with $38 million, then the other New York bidder

126
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,720
came back with $38.2.

127
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:59,520
It went to $38.5, $39, $39.5, $40, before the Hong Kong buyer bid $40.5 million, which

128
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,760
meant no response, and the auctioneer's hammer came down on what would become the

129
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,160
third highest-priced art sale of the year.

130
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:18,480
With fees, the buyer ended up paying $46,242,500, meaning Christie's netted at least $5,742,500

131
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,380
from the 10-minute and 14-second long auction.

132
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,000
Across the evening, though, some $421 million of art was sold.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,480
That means this one four-hour event, and its 79 lots, accounted for almost a full percent

134
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,180
of the entire world's art sales in 2020 by value, and that Christie's, as a company,

135
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:44,480
earned upwards of $60 million.

136
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,760
So where's the problem?

137
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,320
So far, most of this process probably seems above board—it's just a collection of

138
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,920
wealthy people buying and selling expensive art through a few exclusive auction houses.

139
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,420
Well, it's not so much the process itself, but what it enables.

140
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:09,200
Most of the issues arise out of a simple truth—art does not have intrinsic value.

141
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
Say you stopped by a thrift store, saw this painting on the wall, and it had no label,

142
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,360
no price tag, no information at all beyond the piece itself—how much would you pay

143
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,460
for it?

144
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,140
Some would only spare $20 or $30, while others, impressed with its intricacy and age, might

145
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,560
pay a couple hundred dollars for it.

146
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,680
This is roughly what happened in 1958, when it was presented to a small auction in London

147
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,000
as a poorly maintained copy of a lost work by Leonardo da Vinci, and sold for 45 pounds

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
to Minnie and Warren Kunz.

149
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,640
The couple carried the painting with them to Southampton, then boarded the ship bound

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,840
for Houston to return from their European vacation.

151
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,320
In 1987, the artwork was inherited by Kunz's nephew, Basil Clovis Hendry, who hung it in

152
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,680
his Baton Rouge, Louisiana home until his death in 2004.

153
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,240
His daughter, Susan Hendry Turrell, brought the work, and much of the rest of her father's

154
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,760
estate, to the New Orleans Auction Gallery, where it was listed with a sale estimate of

155
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,320
$1,200 to $1,800.

156
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,160
It was bought for an unknown amount less than $10,000 by a pair of art dealers, Alexander

157
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,600
Parrish and Robert Simon, who had a long-shot hunch that it could be worth far more than

158
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,660
that.

159
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,920
They therefore hired a paintings conservator from NYU to restore the work, and as part

160
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,280
of her process, she took infrared photographs of the piece to be able to see through the

161
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,160
layers of paint.

162
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,120
This unearthed the lowest layer, which included the very first strokes—the ones the artist

163
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,580
took to outline the general composition of the painting.

164
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,420
These first strokes largely matched up with the final product, except for here—the thumb.

165
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,120
They outlined the thumb in a straight position, rather than the curved shape seen in all known

166
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,300
copies of the lost da Vinci painting.

167
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:02,220
It seemed that the artist changed their mind, which would make no sense when copying a painting.

168
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,140
These few hidden strokes served as a crucial, initial piece of evidence that this might

169
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,700
be the original Salvatore Mundi, painted by Leonardo da Vinci himself.

170
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,980
Therefore, Parrish and Simon spent the better part of the next five years traveling around,

171
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,820
showing the piece to experts and curators, garnering support for their theory.

172
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:30,100
In 2011, they attained definitive validation—London's National Gallery exhibited the Salvatore

173
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,520
Mundi, and the name on the label read Leonardo da Vinci.

174
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,500
The value instantly skyrocketed.

175
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,140
Parrish and Simon sold the piece to another dealer for $80 million, who immediately sold

176
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,460
it to a Russian collector for $127 million, who then brought the piece to auction.

177
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:53,540
Only the 24th known painting widely attributed to da Vinci, and one of only two not held

178
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,340
by a museum, this was sure to fetch an eye-popping price.

179
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:04,220
After a world tour of exhibitions, Leonardo's Salvatore Mundi was sold by Christie's

180
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:14,620
New York for $450,312,500 to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—an all-time record price

181
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,540
for the sale of a piece of art.

182
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,060
Prior to the recognition by top museums that this piece was, in fact, a da Vinci, the value

183
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,940
was in the low thousands.

184
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,260
After, it was in the hundreds of millions.

185
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,620
That's to say, art has no intrinsic value.

186
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,420
The value for what Christie's, Sotheby's, or other top auction houses sell is all in

187
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,460
who painted it, who owned it, and who wants it.

188
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:47,340
An uninformed person can look at a car, or a plate of food, or a house, and guess with

189
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,460
some accuracy what it's worth, but that's not the case with art.

190
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Nearly all of the value is invisible, because the value is simply what other people are

191
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,780
willing to pay.

192
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:04,940
Now, here's the question—would you genuinely believe that if you had bought that dilapidated

193
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,220
portrait of Jesus at the estate auction in New Orleans, you could have successfully convinced

194
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,580
the National Gallery in London that it was a true da Vinci?

195
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:17,940
Do you believe that if, back in 1960, Roy Lichtenstein had met you, instead of Castelli,

196
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,820
you could have successfully convinced enough people of the artist's future prospects

197
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,780
to sell at his first show prior to opening?

198
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,340
Any answer but no is arrogant.

199
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,260
Value in the art world is defined by an incredibly small number of gatekeepers—the curators,

200
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,220
gallery owners, and auctioneers.

201
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:43,800
So, to summarize, the art world is an incredibly small, incredibly consolidated market where

202
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,580
prices are almost entirely subjective.

203
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:54,700
These three factors combined mean that, properly executed, sellers can decide what prices are.

204
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,060
Between 2005 and 2013, one-fourth of all Andy Warhol works put up for auction were

205
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,580
bought by a single man—Jose Mugrabi.

206
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:10,400
Now, Mugrabi owns over 800 Warhol artworks in total, representing close to a billion

207
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,060
dollars in value—at least on paper.

208
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:19,620
Therefore, Mugrabi is highly, highly invested in making sure that the Warhol market stays

209
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,620
hot.

210
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:26,320
Now there is, of course, a reason why in more traditional markets, monopolies and oligopolies

211
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,740
are disallowed.

212
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,660
When power is too concentrated, a single player can influence the entire market to their own

213
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,660
benefit.

214
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:40,140
That's exactly what Mugrabi does—whenever a Warhol is up for sale at auction, he'll

215
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
be there.

216
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,220
Often, Mugrabi will be one of the first to bid, and will work to push up prices with

217
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,580
his early offers.

218
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:52,300
Mugrabi is more than willing to strategically overpay for a Warhol work because he knows

219
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,100
that it'll be worth it—that's because auctions act as the only publicly available

220
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,420
index of art prices.

221
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:04,060
When one private individual sells artwork to another private individual, the price is

222
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,580
not public knowledge.

223
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,620
When one private individual sells artwork at auction, the price is public knowledge.

224
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,620
So that means that Mugrabi is willing to go to an auction and bid copiously, regardless

225
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,340
of the actual market value.

226
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,980
Either he'll have pushed up the price for another bidder, which is good for him, or

227
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,340
he'll have overpaid for the art, which is still good for him.

228
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,300
That's because either way, the fact that a Warhol work sold for a good price and the

229
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,820
world knows it pushes up the hypothetical value of the rest of his Warhol pieces, which

230
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,340
he can then sell for more in private.

231
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:46,380
What's more, this manner of market manipulation is entirely legal.

232
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,300
Collectors will choose a niche, and then dominate it.

233
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,420
Plus, given the small size of the high-end art market, Mugrabi almost certainly knows

234
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,600
all the other top Warhol collectors, and collectively, they realize that if one of them sells a piece

235
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,980
publicly for a bad price, it'll hurt all of their portfolio values, so an informal

236
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,540
social cabal arises that further influences the market and artificially inflates values.

237
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,640
However, this is only the tip of the iceberg.

238
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,860
The same market conditions that enable Mugrabi's influence mean that collusion and corruption

239
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,340
are confoundingly easy.

240
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,940
There isn't one blockbuster scam at the center of the art market.

241
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,380
Rather, it's a market composed of scams.

242
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,760
For example, counter-intuitively, wealthy individuals can turn a profit by donating

243
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
art.

244
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,020
It's rather simple—in the US, when one donates artwork to a non-profit museum, they

245
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,020
get a tax write-off.

246
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,720
That's to say, if someone donates a painting worth $10 million, they don't have to pay

247
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,860
taxes on $10 million of income, which, in theory, would save them about $4 million.

248
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,660
Of course, given the difficulties in determining art's worth, the IRS requires expensive

249
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,300
artwork to be professionally appraised prior to a write-off.

250
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,580
Considering all the aforementioned market conditions, though, it's not tough to manipulate

251
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,200
an appraisal to go one's way.

252
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,740
Of the hundreds of thousands of artworks donated each year, the IRS audits only a couple hundred,

253
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,720
but even those few paint a stark picture.

254
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,460
In 2018 and 2019, about a third of audited artwork was found to be overvalued in its

255
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,980
appraisal by an average of 38%.

256
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,380
In fact, overall, only 42% of artwork was found to have been appraised correctly, in

257
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,420
part thanks to the competing pressure for some to undervalue their work when it's

258
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,380
received through inheritance, in order to reduce the estate taxes paid upon transfer

259
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,380
of ownership.

260
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,660
So, a rich person could buy a piece of art for $4 million, let it appreciate over a few

261
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,380
years, shop around for a favorable appraisal, overstate its value, rely on the fact that

262
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,620
the IRS only audits a tiny percentage of prices, donate the art for $10 million, and they'll

263
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,380
have already broken even.

264
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:06,420
It doesn't take much for the percentage a wealthy person will save in taxes to eclipse

265
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,500
their original purchase price—as a cherry on top, of course.

266
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,900
The presence of an artist's work in a museum is known to inflate the value of their other

267
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:20,020
art, so if a wealthy person owns a collection of a given artist's work, as is common,

268
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:24,420
donations earn them further money through the effect it has on the rest of their collection.

269
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,580
In aggregate, the situation is this—it was created by rich people, for rich people,

270
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,060
so it suits their needs.

271
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:38,860
Whether it's tax avoidance, money laundering, or simple price fixing, the art market enables

272
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,100
all.

273
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,740
Despite this, it's almost entirely unregulated.

274
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,560
There are no official records of who owns what or how much they paid, so it's nearly

275
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,020
impossible to prove any malpractice in the market.

276
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:57,060
It's a largely lawless market, except for the simple, practical rule that you must be

277
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,020
able to spend millions to enter it.

278
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,140
So, who loses out?

279
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,060
Well, for one, artists.

280
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,100
Rich people use artwork like trading cards, coveting a select few for arbitrary reasons,

281
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:14,660
which excludes those who are unable to persuade the gatekeepers of their value—those who

282
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,420
don't fit the gallery's vision of a marketable artist.

283
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,660
Art is no longer an exercise of skill—it's one of branding.

284
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,420
Warhols are like Supreme, but for the wealthiest percent of a percent.

285
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,920
Who also loses out is us—everyone who is unable to access this exclusive market by

286
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:37,020
sinking millions of dollars into a single, volatile investment.

287
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,340
We lose out because we can't conduct the same financial wizardry as those who walk

288
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,460
through Sotheby's doors.

289
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,940
We can access the stock market, where tax avoidance, money laundering, and price fixing

290
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,980
are heavily regulated and monitored, but not this market, where these ruses go largely

291
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,500
unnoticed.

292
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:01,120
The reality is that any market can be exploited, which is why markets are regulated.

293
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,500
The difference here is that art is a unique market where individual players have both

294
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:13,620
the influence to manipulate the market, and the influence to keep the market manipulatable.

295
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,220
Something you've heard so far is about the largely legal malpractice the art market

296
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,380
enables, but it also makes illegal actions like money laundering and forgery strikingly

297
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
easy.

298
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,480
Therefore, as usual, I made an exclusive Nebula companion video diving deeper into that subject

299
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,260
for those who found this video particularly interesting.

300
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,940
I was able to do that because Nebula, unlike YouTube, has no algorithm to punish me for

301
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,940
publishing a video that only the most engaged viewers are going to be interested in.

302
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,020
Nebula was founded and is owned by creators, so it's made to be the best home to our

303
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,820
content, with no ads and a financial model that enables exclusive companion videos and

304
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,300
big-budget Nebula originals.

305
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,340
We've also made sure that Nebula is the absolute best deal in the streaming world

306
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:56,380
by partnering with CuriosityStream.

307
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,460
Now, when you sign up for any subscription at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you

308
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,580
get access to Nebula too.

309
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:09,900
That means, for the cost of a fancy cheeseburger—less than $15 a year—you can watch all of Nebula

310
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,360
and all of CuriosityStream, including Hevel, their first ever original feature film telling

311
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,740
the true story of a famed British actor who dropped everything to join the fight against

312
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,500
ISIS in Syria.

313
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,220
Considering you get both Nebula and CuriosityStream for a year for what you pay for a month of

314
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,340
other streaming services, you can tell why I call it the best deal in streaming, and

315
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,100
even while getting that amazing deal, you'll be supporting Wendover and all the other independent

316
