10060	12980	COVID-19 is a devious disease.
12980	18400	It's not deadly enough to kill a large proportion of its hosts, so they go on to spread it to
18400	23460	an incredible number of individuals, meaning its fairly low mortality rate has already
23460	25980	killed hundreds of thousands.
25980	31440	It disguises itself, presenting like a common cold, yet can escalate to something far more
31440	32500	worrisome.
32500	36940	It also hides, with the possibility of being spread by someone who does not exhibit any
36940	38620	symptoms whatsoever.
38620	44960	Altogether, this leads to one simple truth—until there is an effective treatment, a vaccine,
44960	49660	or herd immunity, perhaps the most important thing a healthcare system itself can do to
49660	53420	minimize the number of cases and deaths is test.
53420	58880	Worldwide, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 has ramped up incredibly fast.
58880	63400	The first genetic sequence of the virus was published on January 5th, and within days,
63400	66480	the first testing protocols were published by researchers.
66480	70820	In the second half of January, the world was testing hundreds of individuals per day.
70820	76080	By February, they were testing thousands per day, then in March, hundreds of thousands,
76080	82000	and now, in July 2020, millions of coronavirus tests are performed and processed each and
82000	83520	every day.
83520	87020	Believe it or not, though, this is not enough.
87020	91640	The process has been mired in issues and, to get to the point where testing can actually
91640	97600	minimize the damage, rather than just quantify it, we need to rethink the system itself.
97600	103800	The core of any COVID test is a laboratory method known as a polymerase chain reaction.
103800	109000	This is a commonly used procedure that copies DNA, or, through reverse transcription, RNA,
109000	110560	enough so that it can be studied.
110560	115660	The various steps in the process—denaturation, annealing, and elongation—require various
115660	120460	specific temperatures and so performing this process requires a machine called a thermal
120460	121460	cycler.
121460	125980	These thermal cyclers can reach precise temperatures incredibly quickly and accurately, but it
125980	127780	comes at a cost.
127780	132100	The cheapest thermal cyclers are priced in the thousands of dollars, but the high-throughput
132100	137560	ones used to process COVID tests often cost in the many tens of thousands of dollars.
137560	142720	Therefore, at this time, it is not practical for every doctor's office to have one, especially
142720	146860	as many less-ordinated variants require trained technicians to operate.
146860	150900	There are some faster point-of-care tests hitting the market, but they tend to be less
150900	155120	accurate, more expensive, and can process fewer tests at a time.
155120	160000	Therefore, while samples can be collected almost anywhere, processing them is a greater
160000	161340	challenge.
161340	166540	One of the largest testing providers in the US is a company called Quest Diagnostics.
166540	172100	At the time of writing, they have processed about 17% of all tests performed in the US
172100	175780	and have the capacity for 130,000 each day.
175780	180380	They carry out this work in one of their 28 labs spread out across the United States.
180380	185380	Of course, it's easy to see that there are wide swaths of the country without a lab nearby,
185380	189560	so to get samples from where they're collected to where they're processed, they rely on
189560	192420	their own small logistics network.
192420	197440	This system involves plenty of ground transportation, but also, in order to quickly transport samples
197440	201340	from far away areas to the lab, they use airplanes.
201340	205980	Each night, after the day samples have been collected around the country, Quest Diagnostics'
205980	209740	fleet of airplanes get to the sky starting at around 7 PM.
209740	214060	These 20 or so aircraft are primarily based in Redding, Pennsylvania and Lawrenceville,
214060	215060	Georgia.
215060	222220	As an example, on July 16th, 2020, one aircraft—a Pilatus PC-12 registered as M338QD—took
222220	228060	off at 8.45 PM from Redding, Pennsylvania and flew to Elmira, Syracuse, Rochester, Niagara
228060	232400	Falls, Allegheny County, Manassas, and Baltimore where samples were trucked to a lab a few
232400	234380	miles from BWI Airport.
234380	238440	The aircraft then returned to Redding, Pennsylvania by 3.30 AM.
238440	242540	On that night, the majority of their aircraft focused their flights on the American South,
242540	243540	though.
243540	248560	This is a region without many Quest Diagnostics labs and a surge of cases at that time.
248560	253240	Another PC-12, for example, flew from Lawrenceville, Georgia to Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tampa,
253240	257640	Orlando, Valdosta, Lawrenceville, Roanoke, Manassas, and Greensboro before returning
257640	260240	to Lawrenceville all in one night.
260240	263960	Filling in the rest of the routes, you can see just how much ground this small airline
263960	268600	covered in one night—stopping at a large number of cities and towns, going to just
268600	270080	a few labs.
270080	275440	Now, in theory, a system like this, bringing a whole country's worth of samples to a
275440	281600	few central sites, should provide economies and efficiencies of scale and, to an extent,
281600	287880	it does, however, other economic concepts have simultaneously decreased its effectiveness.
287880	293320	To start with, there's a heavy supply and demand imbalance for crucial equipment.
293320	298800	To perform a test, about 20 different consumable supplies are needed, including nasal swabs,
298800	302040	transport tubes, reagents, and other equipment.
302040	307000	Without any of these 20 items, a test cannot be performed so a bottleneck in any one of
307000	310000	those 20 supply chains stops testing.
310000	314720	In addition, economic forces are actually decreasing overall efficiency.
314720	318840	Particularly in a country like the US, where testing is overwhelmingly conducted by private
318840	323300	organizations rather than the government, thousands of providers are each bidding against
323300	325120	each other for equipment.
325120	329820	In conventional economics, one typically wants to avoid monopolies and oligopolies because
329820	333180	a few number of players have too much power.
333180	337980	This is why, in countries like the UK, for example, where 75% of the grocery market is
337980	343780	cornered by four firms, products like milk are sold for just about what it costs to produce—farmers
343780	345180	barely turn a profit.
345180	349820	That's because, if a farmer can't sell their milk to Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda,
349820	353900	or Morrison's, they don't really have another option so they'll take any price
353900	358620	they can get and meanwhile, there are plenty of farmers so the grocery stores have plenty
358620	361780	of options if one says no to their low price.
361780	367220	Meanwhile, in the COVID test supply market, the producers have thousands upon thousands
367220	372760	of potential customers—the testing providers—so if one customer won't accept a high price,
372760	377020	there are plenty of others and one that most desperately needs the supplies inevitably
377020	378020	will.
378020	382180	If, for example, the federal government was the only customer in the US, or just the largest
382180	386580	one by far, the supply producers would just have to accept what the government paid because
386580	388020	there would be no alternatives.
388420	393860	Now, resources might not be allocated as efficiently using a centrally planned system, but it would
393860	396140	at least come at a lower cost.
396140	401080	In the real world, the larger providers like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics do have higher
401080	405300	buying power, processing more tests per day than most countries, but they still have to
405300	410620	compete against the rest of the world in procuring supplies which increases cost.
410620	414860	In recent weeks, Quest Diagnostics, and other major testing providers, have been able to
414860	419240	collect far more samples than they have been able to process, and tests now take up to
419240	422820	two weeks, or sometimes more, to come back.
422820	428020	Tests that take so long to return are of little use since many asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic
428020	432260	patients might not quarantine for that full period while waiting for results.
432260	437940	Therefore, major focus has been placed on how to increase the efficiency of testing.
437940	443140	For this, Quest Diagnostics received the first emergency use authorization in the US from
443140	446980	the FDA to implement a technique known as pooled testing.
446980	451780	With this, up to four samples will be combined and tested together.
451780	456980	If they generate a negative result, then all four tests are considered negative.
456980	460740	If the group tests positive, then they are separated and tested individually.
460740	466100	Now, if 100 people are tested traditionally, 100 tests will have to be processed, but let's
466100	469500	say that 100 people are tested using pooled testing.
469500	474740	In the US, on average, about 8% of tests currently come back positive, so with 100
474740	479620	tests, grouped into 25 pools of four, you would expect about 32% of those to come back
479620	480680	positive.
480680	485820	For those positive pools, you'd then process each test individually, so you will have processed
485820	488380	five times for four results.
488380	493940	For the 17 pools that came back negative, you only processed once, meaning that altogether,
493940	499600	this pooled testing technique used 57 processing slots to generate 100 results, effectively
499600	501980	almost doubling capacity.
501980	506220	This pooled testing technique, though, only works if testing is widespread enough that
506220	509840	only a small portion of results come back positive.
509840	514260	If an average of 20% of results came back positive, as was the case in the US in early
514260	517220	April, the efficiency would diminish quickly.
517220	522420	In that case, you'd expect to have to retest 20 of the 25 pools meaning that, overall,
522420	527820	you'd use 105 processing slots to generate 100 results—more than if you just tested
527820	530220	them all individually, therefore.
530220	535020	This technique does not work as well for testing in hotspots, where positivity rates are far
535020	536020	higher.
536020	541140	Conversely, though, if positivity rates are quite low, the efficiency of pooled testing
541140	547340	can increase as one could efficiently group 8 or 12 or 16 or more tests together.
547340	551460	Lower positivity rates can be achieved through collecting more samples, so pooled sampling
551500	556020	can increase testing capacity, therefore increasing its own efficiency.
556020	561980	But no matter how fast PCR testing itself is, it is always a lagging indicator.
561980	566460	That is because it takes a number of days for people to develop symptoms after exposure,
566460	571300	then more days for them to decide to get tested, then more days for the test to come back.
571300	575860	That means that, realistically, it will take weeks for significant upticks in transmission
575860	577460	to show in the data.
577460	583360	Therefore, some focus has been placed on developing a more real-time indicator for COVID transmission.
583360	586140	The solution for that is sewage.
586140	590400	Sewage is naturally aggregated into a few processing plants, so by testing it for the
590400	594820	presence of COVID's genetic signature, one can gain a more accurate picture of how a
594820	599580	whole area is doing without the potential sampling biases of clinical testing.
599580	604420	This technique can show if an area has coronavirus transmission, but it can also give a big picture
604420	606360	view of how much.
606360	611540	Not only that, but in research tests, sewage testing indicates spikes about a week before
611540	615560	clinical testing, meaning it can help tell governments if they should increase restrictions
615560	618820	before it's potentially too late to make an impact.
618820	621560	But let's go back to the pooled testing.
621560	626600	Using sewage testing, you can know the relative chance of a single person from a given area
626600	631420	of having coronavirus, so imagine if you could combine the sewage testing and clinical pooled
631420	634140	testing into one cohesive system.
634140	637420	This technique was proposed by a group of researchers from Berkeley.
637420	641940	If you know that, say, there was a 25% chance of a test from Florida coming back positive,
641940	645980	you would know that it would be more efficient to test that on its own, however, if you knew
645980	649700	that there was a 1% chance that a test from North Dakota came back positive, you could
649700	655440	pool that test with a large group of other low-risk tests and save processing slots.
655440	660300	You could also, for example, know that a sample from a healthcare or retail worker would have
660300	664420	a much higher chance of coming back positive than a test of a businessperson working from
664420	665420	home.
665420	670080	The Berkeley research proposes a system of machine learning to scale pooled testing sizes
670080	672420	based on risk factors.
672420	676920	Lower risk samples would be grouped into large pools and high risk samples would be grouped
676920	681680	into smaller pools or tested alone so that pooled testing never leads to an efficiency
681680	684720	disadvantage, no longer the positivity rate.
684720	690480	The true genius of pooled testing is that efficiency increases as test numbers increase
690480	695240	so it only takes twice the resources to test a population once daily as it does to test
695240	696600	once monthly.
696600	701120	Hypothetically, a pooled testing system designed by machine learning could lower the cost of
701120	706680	a test to just $3 to $5, meaning the frequency of testing could increase dramatically.
706680	712900	Now, we already know when the crunch time will be for testing—fall 2020.
713080	717780	Sometime between October and December, each year, there begins a massive increase in the
717780	721100	number of people catching the flu, which is highly seasonal.
721100	725920	COVID-19's symptoms closely mirror those of the flu, therefore there will be a massive
725920	729080	increase in people exhibiting COVID symptoms.
729080	733220	Those people will want to get tested to rule out the possibility of coronavirus, which
733220	738260	means demand will be higher than ever for testing even if real infection numbers are
738260	739260	lower.
739260	743580	While supplies for testing produce now are being used now, there is no stash being built
743580	748600	up, which means testing providers and healthcare systems worldwide have a hefty task at hand
748600	754920	if there is to be any hope of testing capacity matching demand in the coming winter.
754920	760000	Like so many things going on right now, COVID testing logistics and its issues are strongly
760000	764180	rooted in economic theory and there's plenty more I could talk about, but this video was
764180	768160	getting a little too long to still appease the YouTube algorithm so I've posted an
768160	772780	extended cut of this video on Nebula including discussion of exactly that.
772780	777620	Nebula is, of course, the streaming site that myself and a bunch of other of the internet's
777620	780380	top educational creators teamed up to create.
780380	784340	Instead of this ad right now, you could be watching the extended cut of this video, or
784340	790000	any of our other videos early and ad-free, or some of our special Nebula exclusive projects.
790000	794540	In fact, there's a brand new Nebula original going out tomorrow from our other channel,
794540	797920	if that stuff is interesting, or you could watch Tom Scott's game show, Money, which
797920	798920	I'm in.
798920	802920	We're also super excited that Nebula is teamed up with CuriosityStream, which is another
802920	806940	of the internet's best streaming sites, home to thousands of fantastic documentaries
806940	811880	and non-fiction shows like their one on Gander International Airport—specifically, on how
811880	816440	it and the town reinvented itself as it shifted from being one of the most important airports
816440	819680	in the world to just another small Canadian airfield.
819680	823980	Together, Nebula and CuriosityStream are offering an amazing deal.
823980	829760	For a limited time, CuriosityStream and Nebula are bundled together for less than $15 a year.
829760	834080	I'm confident in saying that that is the best deal in streaming, and it's available
834080	837520	only by going to curiositystream.com slash Wendover.
