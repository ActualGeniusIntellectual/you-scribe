4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,980
COVID-19 is a devious disease.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,400
It's not deadly enough to kill a large proportion of its hosts, so they go on to spread it to

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,460
an incredible number of individuals, meaning its fairly low mortality rate has already

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,980
killed hundreds of thousands.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,440
It disguises itself, presenting like a common cold, yet can escalate to something far more

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,500
worrisome.

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,940
It also hides, with the possibility of being spread by someone who does not exhibit any

11
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,620
symptoms whatsoever.

12
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,960
Altogether, this leads to one simple truth—until there is an effective treatment, a vaccine,

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,660
or herd immunity, perhaps the most important thing a healthcare system itself can do to

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:53,420
minimize the number of cases and deaths is test.

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,880
Worldwide, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 has ramped up incredibly fast.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,400
The first genetic sequence of the virus was published on January 5th, and within days,

17
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,480
the first testing protocols were published by researchers.

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,820
In the second half of January, the world was testing hundreds of individuals per day.

19
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,080
By February, they were testing thousands per day, then in March, hundreds of thousands,

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,000
and now, in July 2020, millions of coronavirus tests are performed and processed each and

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
every day.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,020
Believe it or not, though, this is not enough.

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:31,640
The process has been mired in issues and, to get to the point where testing can actually

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,600
minimize the damage, rather than just quantify it, we need to rethink the system itself.

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,800
The core of any COVID test is a laboratory method known as a polymerase chain reaction.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,000
This is a commonly used procedure that copies DNA, or, through reverse transcription, RNA,

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,560
enough so that it can be studied.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,660
The various steps in the process—denaturation, annealing, and elongation—require various

29
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,460
specific temperatures and so performing this process requires a machine called a thermal

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,460
cycler.

31
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,980
These thermal cyclers can reach precise temperatures incredibly quickly and accurately, but it

32
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,780
comes at a cost.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,100
The cheapest thermal cyclers are priced in the thousands of dollars, but the high-throughput

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,560
ones used to process COVID tests often cost in the many tens of thousands of dollars.

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,720
Therefore, at this time, it is not practical for every doctor's office to have one, especially

36
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,860
as many less-ordinated variants require trained technicians to operate.

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,900
There are some faster point-of-care tests hitting the market, but they tend to be less

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,120
accurate, more expensive, and can process fewer tests at a time.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,000
Therefore, while samples can be collected almost anywhere, processing them is a greater

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,340
challenge.

41
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,540
One of the largest testing providers in the US is a company called Quest Diagnostics.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,100
At the time of writing, they have processed about 17% of all tests performed in the US

43
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,780
and have the capacity for 130,000 each day.

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,380
They carry out this work in one of their 28 labs spread out across the United States.

45
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Of course, it's easy to see that there are wide swaths of the country without a lab nearby,

46
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,560
so to get samples from where they're collected to where they're processed, they rely on

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,420
their own small logistics network.

48
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,440
This system involves plenty of ground transportation, but also, in order to quickly transport samples

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,340
from far away areas to the lab, they use airplanes.

50
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,980
Each night, after the day samples have been collected around the country, Quest Diagnostics'

51
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,740
fleet of airplanes get to the sky starting at around 7 PM.

52
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,060
These 20 or so aircraft are primarily based in Redding, Pennsylvania and Lawrenceville,

53
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,060
Georgia.

54
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,220
As an example, on July 16th, 2020, one aircraft—a Pilatus PC-12 registered as M338QD—took

55
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:48,060
off at 8.45 PM from Redding, Pennsylvania and flew to Elmira, Syracuse, Rochester, Niagara

56
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,400
Falls, Allegheny County, Manassas, and Baltimore where samples were trucked to a lab a few

57
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,380
miles from BWI Airport.

58
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,440
The aircraft then returned to Redding, Pennsylvania by 3.30 AM.

59
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,540
On that night, the majority of their aircraft focused their flights on the American South,

60
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
though.

61
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,560
This is a region without many Quest Diagnostics labs and a surge of cases at that time.

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,240
Another PC-12, for example, flew from Lawrenceville, Georgia to Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tampa,

63
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,640
Orlando, Valdosta, Lawrenceville, Roanoke, Manassas, and Greensboro before returning

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,240
to Lawrenceville all in one night.

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,960
Filling in the rest of the routes, you can see just how much ground this small airline

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,600
covered in one night—stopping at a large number of cities and towns, going to just

67
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,080
a few labs.

68
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,440
Now, in theory, a system like this, bringing a whole country's worth of samples to a

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,600
few central sites, should provide economies and efficiencies of scale and, to an extent,

70
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,880
it does, however, other economic concepts have simultaneously decreased its effectiveness.

71
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,320
To start with, there's a heavy supply and demand imbalance for crucial equipment.

72
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,800
To perform a test, about 20 different consumable supplies are needed, including nasal swabs,

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,040
transport tubes, reagents, and other equipment.

74
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,000
Without any of these 20 items, a test cannot be performed so a bottleneck in any one of

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
those 20 supply chains stops testing.

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,720
In addition, economic forces are actually decreasing overall efficiency.

77
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,840
Particularly in a country like the US, where testing is overwhelmingly conducted by private

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,300
organizations rather than the government, thousands of providers are each bidding against

79
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,120
each other for equipment.

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,820
In conventional economics, one typically wants to avoid monopolies and oligopolies because

81
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,180
a few number of players have too much power.

82
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,980
This is why, in countries like the UK, for example, where 75% of the grocery market is

83
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,780
cornered by four firms, products like milk are sold for just about what it costs to produce—farmers

84
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,180
barely turn a profit.

85
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,820
That's because, if a farmer can't sell their milk to Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda,

86
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,900
or Morrison's, they don't really have another option so they'll take any price

87
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,620
they can get and meanwhile, there are plenty of farmers so the grocery stores have plenty

88
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,780
of options if one says no to their low price.

89
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,220
Meanwhile, in the COVID test supply market, the producers have thousands upon thousands

90
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,760
of potential customers—the testing providers—so if one customer won't accept a high price,

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,020
there are plenty of others and one that most desperately needs the supplies inevitably

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,020
will.

93
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,180
If, for example, the federal government was the only customer in the US, or just the largest

94
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,580
one by far, the supply producers would just have to accept what the government paid because

95
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,020
there would be no alternatives.

96
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,860
Now, resources might not be allocated as efficiently using a centrally planned system, but it would

97
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,140
at least come at a lower cost.

98
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:41,080
In the real world, the larger providers like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics do have higher

99
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,300
buying power, processing more tests per day than most countries, but they still have to

100
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,620
compete against the rest of the world in procuring supplies which increases cost.

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,860
In recent weeks, Quest Diagnostics, and other major testing providers, have been able to

102
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:59,240
collect far more samples than they have been able to process, and tests now take up to

103
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,820
two weeks, or sometimes more, to come back.

104
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:08,020
Tests that take so long to return are of little use since many asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic

105
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,260
patients might not quarantine for that full period while waiting for results.

106
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:17,940
Therefore, major focus has been placed on how to increase the efficiency of testing.

107
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,140
For this, Quest Diagnostics received the first emergency use authorization in the US from

108
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,980
the FDA to implement a technique known as pooled testing.

109
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,780
With this, up to four samples will be combined and tested together.

110
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,980
If they generate a negative result, then all four tests are considered negative.

111
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,740
If the group tests positive, then they are separated and tested individually.

112
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,100
Now, if 100 people are tested traditionally, 100 tests will have to be processed, but let's

113
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,500
say that 100 people are tested using pooled testing.

114
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,740
In the US, on average, about 8% of tests currently come back positive, so with 100

115
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,620
tests, grouped into 25 pools of four, you would expect about 32% of those to come back

116
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,680
positive.

117
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,820
For those positive pools, you'd then process each test individually, so you will have processed

118
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,380
five times for four results.

119
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,940
For the 17 pools that came back negative, you only processed once, meaning that altogether,

120
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:19,600
this pooled testing technique used 57 processing slots to generate 100 results, effectively

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,980
almost doubling capacity.

122
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,220
This pooled testing technique, though, only works if testing is widespread enough that

123
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:29,840
only a small portion of results come back positive.

124
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,260
If an average of 20% of results came back positive, as was the case in the US in early

125
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,220
April, the efficiency would diminish quickly.

126
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,420
In that case, you'd expect to have to retest 20 of the 25 pools meaning that, overall,

127
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,820
you'd use 105 processing slots to generate 100 results—more than if you just tested

128
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,220
them all individually, therefore.

129
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,020
This technique does not work as well for testing in hotspots, where positivity rates are far

130
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
higher.

131
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,140
Conversely, though, if positivity rates are quite low, the efficiency of pooled testing

132
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:07,340
can increase as one could efficiently group 8 or 12 or 16 or more tests together.

133
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,460
Lower positivity rates can be achieved through collecting more samples, so pooled sampling

134
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,020
can increase testing capacity, therefore increasing its own efficiency.

135
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,980
But no matter how fast PCR testing itself is, it is always a lagging indicator.

136
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,460
That is because it takes a number of days for people to develop symptoms after exposure,

137
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,300
then more days for them to decide to get tested, then more days for the test to come back.

138
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,860
That means that, realistically, it will take weeks for significant upticks in transmission

139
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,460
to show in the data.

140
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:43,360
Therefore, some focus has been placed on developing a more real-time indicator for COVID transmission.

141
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,140
The solution for that is sewage.

142
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,400
Sewage is naturally aggregated into a few processing plants, so by testing it for the

143
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,820
presence of COVID's genetic signature, one can gain a more accurate picture of how a

144
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,580
whole area is doing without the potential sampling biases of clinical testing.

145
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,420
This technique can show if an area has coronavirus transmission, but it can also give a big picture

146
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,360
view of how much.

147
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,540
Not only that, but in research tests, sewage testing indicates spikes about a week before

148
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,560
clinical testing, meaning it can help tell governments if they should increase restrictions

149
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,820
before it's potentially too late to make an impact.

150
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,560
But let's go back to the pooled testing.

151
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,600
Using sewage testing, you can know the relative chance of a single person from a given area

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,420
of having coronavirus, so imagine if you could combine the sewage testing and clinical pooled

153
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,140
testing into one cohesive system.

154
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,420
This technique was proposed by a group of researchers from Berkeley.

155
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,940
If you know that, say, there was a 25% chance of a test from Florida coming back positive,

156
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,980
you would know that it would be more efficient to test that on its own, however, if you knew

157
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,700
that there was a 1% chance that a test from North Dakota came back positive, you could

158
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,440
pool that test with a large group of other low-risk tests and save processing slots.

159
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,300
You could also, for example, know that a sample from a healthcare or retail worker would have

160
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,420
a much higher chance of coming back positive than a test of a businessperson working from

161
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
home.

162
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,080
The Berkeley research proposes a system of machine learning to scale pooled testing sizes

163
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,420
based on risk factors.

164
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,920
Lower risk samples would be grouped into large pools and high risk samples would be grouped

165
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,680
into smaller pools or tested alone so that pooled testing never leads to an efficiency

166
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,720
disadvantage, no longer the positivity rate.

167
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,480
The true genius of pooled testing is that efficiency increases as test numbers increase

168
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,240
so it only takes twice the resources to test a population once daily as it does to test

169
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,600
once monthly.

170
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,120
Hypothetically, a pooled testing system designed by machine learning could lower the cost of

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,680
a test to just $3 to $5, meaning the frequency of testing could increase dramatically.

172
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,900
Now, we already know when the crunch time will be for testing—fall 2020.

173
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,780
Sometime between October and December, each year, there begins a massive increase in the

174
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,100
number of people catching the flu, which is highly seasonal.

175
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,920
COVID-19's symptoms closely mirror those of the flu, therefore there will be a massive

176
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,080
increase in people exhibiting COVID symptoms.

177
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,220
Those people will want to get tested to rule out the possibility of coronavirus, which

178
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,260
means demand will be higher than ever for testing even if real infection numbers are

179
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
lower.

180
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,580
While supplies for testing produce now are being used now, there is no stash being built

181
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,600
up, which means testing providers and healthcare systems worldwide have a hefty task at hand

182
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,920
if there is to be any hope of testing capacity matching demand in the coming winter.

183
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,000
Like so many things going on right now, COVID testing logistics and its issues are strongly

184
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,180
rooted in economic theory and there's plenty more I could talk about, but this video was

185
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,160
getting a little too long to still appease the YouTube algorithm so I've posted an

186
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,780
extended cut of this video on Nebula including discussion of exactly that.

187
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,620
Nebula is, of course, the streaming site that myself and a bunch of other of the internet's

188
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,380
top educational creators teamed up to create.

189
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,340
Instead of this ad right now, you could be watching the extended cut of this video, or

190
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:10,000
any of our other videos early and ad-free, or some of our special Nebula exclusive projects.

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,540
In fact, there's a brand new Nebula original going out tomorrow from our other channel,

192
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,920
if that stuff is interesting, or you could watch Tom Scott's game show, Money, which

193
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm in.

194
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,920
We're also super excited that Nebula is teamed up with CuriosityStream, which is another

195
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,940
of the internet's best streaming sites, home to thousands of fantastic documentaries

196
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,880
and non-fiction shows like their one on Gander International Airport—specifically, on how

197
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,440
it and the town reinvented itself as it shifted from being one of the most important airports

198
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,680
in the world to just another small Canadian airfield.

199
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,980
Together, Nebula and CuriosityStream are offering an amazing deal.

200
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:49,760
For a limited time, CuriosityStream and Nebula are bundled together for less than $15 a year.

201
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,080
I'm confident in saying that that is the best deal in streaming, and it's available

202
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,520
only by going to curiositystream.com slash Wendover.
