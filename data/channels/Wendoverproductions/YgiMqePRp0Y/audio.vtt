00:10.060 --> 00:12.980
COVID-19 is a devious disease.

00:12.980 --> 00:18.400
It's not deadly enough to kill a large proportion of its hosts, so they go on to spread it to

00:18.400 --> 00:23.460
an incredible number of individuals, meaning its fairly low mortality rate has already

00:23.460 --> 00:25.980
killed hundreds of thousands.

00:25.980 --> 00:31.440
It disguises itself, presenting like a common cold, yet can escalate to something far more

00:31.440 --> 00:32.500
worrisome.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.940
It also hides, with the possibility of being spread by someone who does not exhibit any

00:36.940 --> 00:38.620
symptoms whatsoever.

00:38.620 --> 00:44.960
Altogether, this leads to one simple truth—until there is an effective treatment, a vaccine,

00:44.960 --> 00:49.660
or herd immunity, perhaps the most important thing a healthcare system itself can do to

00:49.660 --> 00:53.420
minimize the number of cases and deaths is test.

00:53.420 --> 00:58.880
Worldwide, diagnostic testing for COVID-19 has ramped up incredibly fast.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.400
The first genetic sequence of the virus was published on January 5th, and within days,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.480
the first testing protocols were published by researchers.

01:06.480 --> 01:10.820
In the second half of January, the world was testing hundreds of individuals per day.

01:10.820 --> 01:16.080
By February, they were testing thousands per day, then in March, hundreds of thousands,

01:16.080 --> 01:22.000
and now, in July 2020, millions of coronavirus tests are performed and processed each and

01:22.000 --> 01:23.520
every day.

01:23.520 --> 01:27.020
Believe it or not, though, this is not enough.

01:27.020 --> 01:31.640
The process has been mired in issues and, to get to the point where testing can actually

01:31.640 --> 01:37.600
minimize the damage, rather than just quantify it, we need to rethink the system itself.

01:37.600 --> 01:43.800
The core of any COVID test is a laboratory method known as a polymerase chain reaction.

01:43.800 --> 01:49.000
This is a commonly used procedure that copies DNA, or, through reverse transcription, RNA,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.560
enough so that it can be studied.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.660
The various steps in the process—denaturation, annealing, and elongation—require various

01:55.660 --> 02:00.460
specific temperatures and so performing this process requires a machine called a thermal

02:00.460 --> 02:01.460
cycler.

02:01.460 --> 02:05.980
These thermal cyclers can reach precise temperatures incredibly quickly and accurately, but it

02:05.980 --> 02:07.780
comes at a cost.

02:07.780 --> 02:12.100
The cheapest thermal cyclers are priced in the thousands of dollars, but the high-throughput

02:12.100 --> 02:17.560
ones used to process COVID tests often cost in the many tens of thousands of dollars.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.720
Therefore, at this time, it is not practical for every doctor's office to have one, especially

02:22.720 --> 02:26.860
as many less-ordinated variants require trained technicians to operate.

02:26.860 --> 02:30.900
There are some faster point-of-care tests hitting the market, but they tend to be less

02:30.900 --> 02:35.120
accurate, more expensive, and can process fewer tests at a time.

02:35.120 --> 02:40.000
Therefore, while samples can be collected almost anywhere, processing them is a greater

02:40.000 --> 02:41.340
challenge.

02:41.340 --> 02:46.540
One of the largest testing providers in the US is a company called Quest Diagnostics.

02:46.540 --> 02:52.100
At the time of writing, they have processed about 17% of all tests performed in the US

02:52.100 --> 02:55.780
and have the capacity for 130,000 each day.

02:55.780 --> 03:00.380
They carry out this work in one of their 28 labs spread out across the United States.

03:00.380 --> 03:05.380
Of course, it's easy to see that there are wide swaths of the country without a lab nearby,

03:05.380 --> 03:09.560
so to get samples from where they're collected to where they're processed, they rely on

03:09.560 --> 03:12.420
their own small logistics network.

03:12.420 --> 03:17.440
This system involves plenty of ground transportation, but also, in order to quickly transport samples

03:17.440 --> 03:21.340
from far away areas to the lab, they use airplanes.

03:21.340 --> 03:25.980
Each night, after the day samples have been collected around the country, Quest Diagnostics'

03:25.980 --> 03:29.740
fleet of airplanes get to the sky starting at around 7 PM.

03:29.740 --> 03:34.060
These 20 or so aircraft are primarily based in Redding, Pennsylvania and Lawrenceville,

03:34.060 --> 03:35.060
Georgia.

03:35.060 --> 03:42.220
As an example, on July 16th, 2020, one aircraft—a Pilatus PC-12 registered as M338QD—took

03:42.220 --> 03:48.060
off at 8.45 PM from Redding, Pennsylvania and flew to Elmira, Syracuse, Rochester, Niagara

03:48.060 --> 03:52.400
Falls, Allegheny County, Manassas, and Baltimore where samples were trucked to a lab a few

03:52.400 --> 03:54.380
miles from BWI Airport.

03:54.380 --> 03:58.440
The aircraft then returned to Redding, Pennsylvania by 3.30 AM.

03:58.440 --> 04:02.540
On that night, the majority of their aircraft focused their flights on the American South,

04:02.540 --> 04:03.540
though.

04:03.540 --> 04:08.560
This is a region without many Quest Diagnostics labs and a surge of cases at that time.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.240
Another PC-12, for example, flew from Lawrenceville, Georgia to Jacksonville, Gainesville, Tampa,

04:13.240 --> 04:17.640
Orlando, Valdosta, Lawrenceville, Roanoke, Manassas, and Greensboro before returning

04:17.640 --> 04:20.240
to Lawrenceville all in one night.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.960
Filling in the rest of the routes, you can see just how much ground this small airline

04:23.960 --> 04:28.600
covered in one night—stopping at a large number of cities and towns, going to just

04:28.600 --> 04:30.080
a few labs.

04:30.080 --> 04:35.440
Now, in theory, a system like this, bringing a whole country's worth of samples to a

04:35.440 --> 04:41.600
few central sites, should provide economies and efficiencies of scale and, to an extent,

04:41.600 --> 04:47.880
it does, however, other economic concepts have simultaneously decreased its effectiveness.

04:47.880 --> 04:53.320
To start with, there's a heavy supply and demand imbalance for crucial equipment.

04:53.320 --> 04:58.800
To perform a test, about 20 different consumable supplies are needed, including nasal swabs,

04:58.800 --> 05:02.040
transport tubes, reagents, and other equipment.

05:02.040 --> 05:07.000
Without any of these 20 items, a test cannot be performed so a bottleneck in any one of

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
those 20 supply chains stops testing.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.720
In addition, economic forces are actually decreasing overall efficiency.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.840
Particularly in a country like the US, where testing is overwhelmingly conducted by private

05:18.840 --> 05:23.300
organizations rather than the government, thousands of providers are each bidding against

05:23.300 --> 05:25.120
each other for equipment.

05:25.120 --> 05:29.820
In conventional economics, one typically wants to avoid monopolies and oligopolies because

05:29.820 --> 05:33.180
a few number of players have too much power.

05:33.180 --> 05:37.980
This is why, in countries like the UK, for example, where 75% of the grocery market is

05:37.980 --> 05:43.780
cornered by four firms, products like milk are sold for just about what it costs to produce—farmers

05:43.780 --> 05:45.180
barely turn a profit.

05:45.180 --> 05:49.820
That's because, if a farmer can't sell their milk to Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda,

05:49.820 --> 05:53.900
or Morrison's, they don't really have another option so they'll take any price

05:53.900 --> 05:58.620
they can get and meanwhile, there are plenty of farmers so the grocery stores have plenty

05:58.620 --> 06:01.780
of options if one says no to their low price.

06:01.780 --> 06:07.220
Meanwhile, in the COVID test supply market, the producers have thousands upon thousands

06:07.220 --> 06:12.760
of potential customers—the testing providers—so if one customer won't accept a high price,

06:12.760 --> 06:17.020
there are plenty of others and one that most desperately needs the supplies inevitably

06:17.020 --> 06:18.020
will.

06:18.020 --> 06:22.180
If, for example, the federal government was the only customer in the US, or just the largest

06:22.180 --> 06:26.580
one by far, the supply producers would just have to accept what the government paid because

06:26.580 --> 06:28.020
there would be no alternatives.

06:28.420 --> 06:33.860
Now, resources might not be allocated as efficiently using a centrally planned system, but it would

06:33.860 --> 06:36.140
at least come at a lower cost.

06:36.140 --> 06:41.080
In the real world, the larger providers like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics do have higher

06:41.080 --> 06:45.300
buying power, processing more tests per day than most countries, but they still have to

06:45.300 --> 06:50.620
compete against the rest of the world in procuring supplies which increases cost.

06:50.620 --> 06:54.860
In recent weeks, Quest Diagnostics, and other major testing providers, have been able to

06:54.860 --> 06:59.240
collect far more samples than they have been able to process, and tests now take up to

06:59.240 --> 07:02.820
two weeks, or sometimes more, to come back.

07:02.820 --> 07:08.020
Tests that take so long to return are of little use since many asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic

07:08.020 --> 07:12.260
patients might not quarantine for that full period while waiting for results.

07:12.260 --> 07:17.940
Therefore, major focus has been placed on how to increase the efficiency of testing.

07:17.940 --> 07:23.140
For this, Quest Diagnostics received the first emergency use authorization in the US from

07:23.140 --> 07:26.980
the FDA to implement a technique known as pooled testing.

07:26.980 --> 07:31.780
With this, up to four samples will be combined and tested together.

07:31.780 --> 07:36.980
If they generate a negative result, then all four tests are considered negative.

07:36.980 --> 07:40.740
If the group tests positive, then they are separated and tested individually.

07:40.740 --> 07:46.100
Now, if 100 people are tested traditionally, 100 tests will have to be processed, but let's

07:46.100 --> 07:49.500
say that 100 people are tested using pooled testing.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.740
In the US, on average, about 8% of tests currently come back positive, so with 100

07:54.740 --> 07:59.620
tests, grouped into 25 pools of four, you would expect about 32% of those to come back

07:59.620 --> 08:00.680
positive.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.820
For those positive pools, you'd then process each test individually, so you will have processed

08:05.820 --> 08:08.380
five times for four results.

08:08.380 --> 08:13.940
For the 17 pools that came back negative, you only processed once, meaning that altogether,

08:13.940 --> 08:19.600
this pooled testing technique used 57 processing slots to generate 100 results, effectively

08:19.600 --> 08:21.980
almost doubling capacity.

08:21.980 --> 08:26.220
This pooled testing technique, though, only works if testing is widespread enough that

08:26.220 --> 08:29.840
only a small portion of results come back positive.

08:29.840 --> 08:34.260
If an average of 20% of results came back positive, as was the case in the US in early

08:34.260 --> 08:37.220
April, the efficiency would diminish quickly.

08:37.220 --> 08:42.420
In that case, you'd expect to have to retest 20 of the 25 pools meaning that, overall,

08:42.420 --> 08:47.820
you'd use 105 processing slots to generate 100 results—more than if you just tested

08:47.820 --> 08:50.220
them all individually, therefore.

08:50.220 --> 08:55.020
This technique does not work as well for testing in hotspots, where positivity rates are far

08:55.020 --> 08:56.020
higher.

08:56.020 --> 09:01.140
Conversely, though, if positivity rates are quite low, the efficiency of pooled testing

09:01.140 --> 09:07.340
can increase as one could efficiently group 8 or 12 or 16 or more tests together.

09:07.340 --> 09:11.460
Lower positivity rates can be achieved through collecting more samples, so pooled sampling

09:11.500 --> 09:16.020
can increase testing capacity, therefore increasing its own efficiency.

09:16.020 --> 09:21.980
But no matter how fast PCR testing itself is, it is always a lagging indicator.

09:21.980 --> 09:26.460
That is because it takes a number of days for people to develop symptoms after exposure,

09:26.460 --> 09:31.300
then more days for them to decide to get tested, then more days for the test to come back.

09:31.300 --> 09:35.860
That means that, realistically, it will take weeks for significant upticks in transmission

09:35.860 --> 09:37.460
to show in the data.

09:37.460 --> 09:43.360
Therefore, some focus has been placed on developing a more real-time indicator for COVID transmission.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.140
The solution for that is sewage.

09:46.140 --> 09:50.400
Sewage is naturally aggregated into a few processing plants, so by testing it for the

09:50.400 --> 09:54.820
presence of COVID's genetic signature, one can gain a more accurate picture of how a

09:54.820 --> 09:59.580
whole area is doing without the potential sampling biases of clinical testing.

09:59.580 --> 10:04.420
This technique can show if an area has coronavirus transmission, but it can also give a big picture

10:04.420 --> 10:06.360
view of how much.

10:06.360 --> 10:11.540
Not only that, but in research tests, sewage testing indicates spikes about a week before

10:11.540 --> 10:15.560
clinical testing, meaning it can help tell governments if they should increase restrictions

10:15.560 --> 10:18.820
before it's potentially too late to make an impact.

10:18.820 --> 10:21.560
But let's go back to the pooled testing.

10:21.560 --> 10:26.600
Using sewage testing, you can know the relative chance of a single person from a given area

10:26.600 --> 10:31.420
of having coronavirus, so imagine if you could combine the sewage testing and clinical pooled

10:31.420 --> 10:34.140
testing into one cohesive system.

10:34.140 --> 10:37.420
This technique was proposed by a group of researchers from Berkeley.

10:37.420 --> 10:41.940
If you know that, say, there was a 25% chance of a test from Florida coming back positive,

10:41.940 --> 10:45.980
you would know that it would be more efficient to test that on its own, however, if you knew

10:45.980 --> 10:49.700
that there was a 1% chance that a test from North Dakota came back positive, you could

10:49.700 --> 10:55.440
pool that test with a large group of other low-risk tests and save processing slots.

10:55.440 --> 11:00.300
You could also, for example, know that a sample from a healthcare or retail worker would have

11:00.300 --> 11:04.420
a much higher chance of coming back positive than a test of a businessperson working from

11:04.420 --> 11:05.420
home.

11:05.420 --> 11:10.080
The Berkeley research proposes a system of machine learning to scale pooled testing sizes

11:10.080 --> 11:12.420
based on risk factors.

11:12.420 --> 11:16.920
Lower risk samples would be grouped into large pools and high risk samples would be grouped

11:16.920 --> 11:21.680
into smaller pools or tested alone so that pooled testing never leads to an efficiency

11:21.680 --> 11:24.720
disadvantage, no longer the positivity rate.

11:24.720 --> 11:30.480
The true genius of pooled testing is that efficiency increases as test numbers increase

11:30.480 --> 11:35.240
so it only takes twice the resources to test a population once daily as it does to test

11:35.240 --> 11:36.600
once monthly.

11:36.600 --> 11:41.120
Hypothetically, a pooled testing system designed by machine learning could lower the cost of

11:41.120 --> 11:46.680
a test to just $3 to $5, meaning the frequency of testing could increase dramatically.

11:46.680 --> 11:52.900
Now, we already know when the crunch time will be for testing—fall 2020.

11:53.080 --> 11:57.780
Sometime between October and December, each year, there begins a massive increase in the

11:57.780 --> 12:01.100
number of people catching the flu, which is highly seasonal.

12:01.100 --> 12:05.920
COVID-19's symptoms closely mirror those of the flu, therefore there will be a massive

12:05.920 --> 12:09.080
increase in people exhibiting COVID symptoms.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.220
Those people will want to get tested to rule out the possibility of coronavirus, which

12:13.220 --> 12:18.260
means demand will be higher than ever for testing even if real infection numbers are

12:18.260 --> 12:19.260
lower.

12:19.260 --> 12:23.580
While supplies for testing produce now are being used now, there is no stash being built

12:23.580 --> 12:28.600
up, which means testing providers and healthcare systems worldwide have a hefty task at hand

12:28.600 --> 12:34.920
if there is to be any hope of testing capacity matching demand in the coming winter.

12:34.920 --> 12:40.000
Like so many things going on right now, COVID testing logistics and its issues are strongly

12:40.000 --> 12:44.180
rooted in economic theory and there's plenty more I could talk about, but this video was

12:44.180 --> 12:48.160
getting a little too long to still appease the YouTube algorithm so I've posted an

12:48.160 --> 12:52.780
extended cut of this video on Nebula including discussion of exactly that.

12:52.780 --> 12:57.620
Nebula is, of course, the streaming site that myself and a bunch of other of the internet's

12:57.620 --> 13:00.380
top educational creators teamed up to create.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.340
Instead of this ad right now, you could be watching the extended cut of this video, or

13:04.340 --> 13:10.000
any of our other videos early and ad-free, or some of our special Nebula exclusive projects.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.540
In fact, there's a brand new Nebula original going out tomorrow from our other channel,

13:14.540 --> 13:17.920
if that stuff is interesting, or you could watch Tom Scott's game show, Money, which

13:17.920 --> 13:18.920
I'm in.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.920
We're also super excited that Nebula is teamed up with CuriosityStream, which is another

13:22.920 --> 13:26.940
of the internet's best streaming sites, home to thousands of fantastic documentaries

13:26.940 --> 13:31.880
and non-fiction shows like their one on Gander International Airport—specifically, on how

13:31.880 --> 13:36.440
it and the town reinvented itself as it shifted from being one of the most important airports

13:36.440 --> 13:39.680
in the world to just another small Canadian airfield.

13:39.680 --> 13:43.980
Together, Nebula and CuriosityStream are offering an amazing deal.

13:43.980 --> 13:49.760
For a limited time, CuriosityStream and Nebula are bundled together for less than $15 a year.

13:49.760 --> 13:54.080
I'm confident in saying that that is the best deal in streaming, and it's available

13:54.080 --> 13:57.520
only by going to curiositystream.com slash Wendover.
