0	5720	If you've been alive for the past ten years, you've surely heard of two planes—the
5720	9340	Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
9340	14720	These two planes have dominated new cycles worldwide because they're both intensely
14720	15720	innovative.
15720	20380	The A380 is the largest passenger plane to have ever existed while the Dreamliner is
20380	24820	one of the most efficient and has an unrivaled focus on passenger comfort.
24820	30740	Concealed by all the fanfare, however, is a much deeper story on economics, innovation,
30740	33500	and how the airline industry works.
33500	39780	So, believe it or not, work on the Airbus A380 began back in 1988.
39780	43580	More people were flying than ever and airports weren't getting all that much bigger.
43580	48420	Airbus eyed the success of the Boeing 747 and needed a bigger aircraft to compete.
48420	54020	At first, Airbus considered making a super-wide jet by placing two A340 fuselages side by
54700	59020	but later opted for the design we see today—a fully double-decker jet.
59020	65460	An A380 can hypothetically carry as many as 868 people in an all-economy configuration
65460	69200	although the densest in practice is 615 seats.
69200	72100	This is more than double that of the 787.
72100	76860	Airbus decided to focus on making a high-capacity aircraft because they believed in the hub
76860	79080	and spoke model of aviation.
79080	83540	With the hub and spoke model, passengers traveling from smaller airports—we'll use Hartford
84060	88300	Connecticut as our example—to a long-haul destination, such as London, England, will
88300	90500	need to connect through a hub.
90500	94220	Passengers would likely take a short flight to New York, Atlanta, or Chicago to catch
94220	96180	their transatlantic flight to London.
96180	98780	Obviously this is inefficient for the passenger.
98780	103020	On almost all routings between Hartford and London, passengers have to fly away from their
103020	106020	destination in order to catch their transatlantic flight.
106020	109300	However, for airlines, there's conceivably an advantage.
109740	113980	Let's say, just for the sake of explanation, there are only six airports in the entire
113980	120660	United States—New York, Boston, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.
120660	125180	If an airline had one flight from every destination to every other destination, they would need
125180	127800	to run 16 routes.
127800	131980	If they just have one hub airport on each coast—we'll say New York and LA—they
131980	136860	just need to have one route from each secondary airport to each hub and one transcontinental
136860	139400	hub to hub route—five in total.
139400	143940	Obviously, there will be quite high demand on the one transcontinental route, so airlines
143940	149060	can put a large aircraft, such as the A380, on that route to fulfill its demand.
149060	154060	Since its release, the A380 has often been placed on those long-haul, high-demand routes,
154060	155200	known as trunk routes.
155200	160260	The second busiest long-haul route in the world, Dubai to London, sees eight A380s a
160260	164820	day and that's in addition to five smaller planes that fly that route.
164820	167340	The Dreamliner serves a very different purpose.
167340	172700	It's a pretty modest sized plane—it can only hold around 220 passengers in a typical
172700	174100	configuration.
174100	178820	Its composite construction makes it extremely light and fuel efficient which helps reduce
178820	180500	operating costs.
180500	187200	In the late 1990s, Boeing started to see slower sales on their large 747s and 767s and started
187200	189300	to consider what to build next.
189300	192860	They initially looked at creating a plane called the Sonic Cruiser which would have
192860	198460	had the same fuel efficiency as conventional aircraft while flying 15% faster—just under
198460	200040	the sound barrier.
200040	203780	Airlines were initially enthused, however, after the attacks on September 11th and the
203780	208520	rising cost of fuel, airlines asked for fuel efficiency rather than speed.
208520	214760	The 787 delivered on that promise by reaching up to 102 miles per gallon per seat compared
214760	218960	to the A380's paltry 74 miles per gallon per seat.
218960	226280	The Dreamliner also has an absolutely enormous range of up to 8,000 miles and better yet,
226280	228760	it's efficient at that range.
228760	233700	Boeing made such a relatively small aircraft because they believe in an entirely different
233700	236800	model of aviation—the point-to-point model.
236800	240960	In this model, in order to get passengers from Hartford to London, airlines just run
240960	243720	a direct flight between Hartford and London.
243720	247740	Obviously demand would be lower, but there still is demand.
247740	251460	In the past, to fly a route like this, an airline would have to use an aircraft with
251460	257100	higher capacity than demand because smaller airplanes couldn't fly such a distance non-stop.
257100	261180	Given that, airlines resorted to the hub and spoke model to concentrate all the demand
261180	265340	on certain routes where they could fill large, long-haul planes.
265340	271100	Now, with planes like the Dreamliner, airlines can fly long routes with less demand while
271100	273520	still being efficient.
273520	277680	The hub and spoke model was also popular in the past because airlines believed that it
277680	281360	was more cost efficient to fly less flights at higher capacity.
281360	283780	It's simple economics really.
283780	288840	Doing a lot of one thing together is cheaper than doing a lot of one thing separately—it's
288840	290200	economies of scale.
290200	294280	Except, that doesn't really extend to the airline industry.
294280	298520	For a larger aircraft you need more ground staff, more flight attendants, more check-in
298520	302020	agents, more fuel, more of pretty much everything.
302020	307900	The only cost that stays the same is pilots and the only ones reduced are gates and takeoffs.
307900	312020	When you're now doing more flights at the largest, most expensive airports, you end
312020	313860	up spending more money.
313860	319000	Airports like Hartford, Connecticut are cheap—labor is cheap, takeoff fees are cheap, everything
319000	323720	costs less than at JFK or Newark—there are just fewer flights to compete with.
323720	328780	Not only that, but flying direct flights clearly costs a ton less because airlines only have
328780	333260	to pay the per-flight costs that I talked about a lot in my why flying is so expensive
333260	336060	video once rather than twice.
336060	341420	United Airlines was a major innovator of the point-to-point model with their Newark hub.
341420	346260	Newark is an airport suited to serve smaller planes so United took the opportunity to open
346260	351220	up direct flights to smaller destinations on the British Isles using narrow body planes
351220	353620	stretched to the upper limits of their range.
353940	359380	United primarily uses the Boeing 757 to reach smaller destinations like Shannon, Ireland,
359380	365460	Belfast, Northern Ireland, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Manchester, Newcastle, and Birmingham,
365460	366460	England.
366460	371500	Often, the United flight from Newark is the only transatlantic flight serving these airports.
371500	376060	United is able to operate these routes because the east coast of the US and the British Isles
376060	379940	are just close enough together to reach with a narrow body plane.
379940	385920	With the 787, airlines are able to open even longer routes between smaller destinations.
385920	390740	Routes like these are called long and skinny—long distance but skinny demand.
390740	395760	These include routes like Tokyo to Seattle, London to Chennai, India, Wuhan, China to
395760	402940	San Francisco, Beijing to Boston, Nairobi, Kenya to Paris, Santiago, Chile to Madrid,
402940	407940	Warsaw, Poland to Beijing, Doha to Edinburgh, Scotland—the list goes on.
407940	413500	The efficiency of this plane has also allowed for an entirely new class of airline—budget
413500	415060	long-haul carriers.
415060	419780	The three main players in this category are Jetstar Airlines based in Australia, Scoot
419780	425540	Airlines based in Singapore, and Norwegian Airlines based in both Scandinavia and London.
425540	429940	Short-haul budget airlines have been possible for a while because of efficient short-range
429940	433700	airplanes, but this really is the first time there has been such an efficient long-haul
433700	439220	airplane so these three airlines use the reduction in operating costs to offer significantly
439220	444580	lower ticket prices while also using the principles of budget airlines that I outlined in my how
444580	446340	budget airlines work video.
446340	452260	What's even more exciting for us consumers is the upcoming Boeing 737 MAX.
452260	458020	This plane is a redeveloped version of the long-existing Boeing 737 featuring a larger
458020	461500	capacity, longer range, and higher fuel efficiency.
461500	467140	This means that we could conceivably see super low demand routes like Manchester to Cleveland,
467140	472100	Lyon to New York, and Belfast to DC operated in the near future.
472100	477380	Norwegian Airlines has already hinted at plans to use the 737 MAX to open up an auxiliary
477380	481660	transatlantic hub in Edinburgh—a relatively small city.
481660	484580	So the A380 was a failure.
484580	488920	Airbus hasn't received a new order in years and it recently announced that it would be
488920	492160	cutting back its production to only 12 a year.
492160	497880	Meanwhile, the 787 has amassed almost 1,200 orders.
497880	502480	Point-to-point flying has always been better for the consumer, but with these recent innovations,
502480	505040	it's now better for airlines too.
505040	511560	Given that, it's clear that point-to-point flying is truly the future of aviation.
511560	516280	Alright I have a lot of things to talk about so bear with me, but above all I need to thank
516280	519480	my amazing sponsor, audible.com.
519480	522840	I personally use audible all the time to listen to books on the go.
522840	527560	It's a great way to learn when it'd normally be difficult like when driving, working out,
527560	529080	walking, and more.
529080	534320	Recently I listened to an absolutely amazing sci-fi thriller called Dark Matter by Blake
534320	535320	Crouch.
535320	539360	It's seriously one of the best I've ever listened to and one of the major scientific
539360	544240	theories used to drive the plot is one that I talked about in a previous video of mine.
544240	546480	Let me know if you figure out which one it is.
