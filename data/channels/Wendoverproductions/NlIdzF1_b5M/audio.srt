1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
If you've been alive for the past ten years, you've surely heard of two planes—the

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,340
Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,720
These two planes have dominated new cycles worldwide because they're both intensely

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,720
innovative.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,380
The A380 is the largest passenger plane to have ever existed while the Dreamliner is

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,820
one of the most efficient and has an unrivaled focus on passenger comfort.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,740
Concealed by all the fanfare, however, is a much deeper story on economics, innovation,

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,500
and how the airline industry works.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,780
So, believe it or not, work on the Airbus A380 began back in 1988.

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,580
More people were flying than ever and airports weren't getting all that much bigger.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,420
Airbus eyed the success of the Boeing 747 and needed a bigger aircraft to compete.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,020
At first, Airbus considered making a super-wide jet by placing two A340 fuselages side by

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,020
but later opted for the design we see today—a fully double-decker jet.

14
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,460
An A380 can hypothetically carry as many as 868 people in an all-economy configuration

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,200
although the densest in practice is 615 seats.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,100
This is more than double that of the 787.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,860
Airbus decided to focus on making a high-capacity aircraft because they believed in the hub

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,080
and spoke model of aviation.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,540
With the hub and spoke model, passengers traveling from smaller airports—we'll use Hartford

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,300
Connecticut as our example—to a long-haul destination, such as London, England, will

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,500
need to connect through a hub.

22
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,220
Passengers would likely take a short flight to New York, Atlanta, or Chicago to catch

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,180
their transatlantic flight to London.

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,780
Obviously this is inefficient for the passenger.

25
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,020
On almost all routings between Hartford and London, passengers have to fly away from their

26
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
destination in order to catch their transatlantic flight.

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,300
However, for airlines, there's conceivably an advantage.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,980
Let's say, just for the sake of explanation, there are only six airports in the entire

29
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:00,660
United States—New York, Boston, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,180
If an airline had one flight from every destination to every other destination, they would need

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,800
to run 16 routes.

32
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,980
If they just have one hub airport on each coast—we'll say New York and LA—they

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,860
just need to have one route from each secondary airport to each hub and one transcontinental

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,400
hub to hub route—five in total.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,940
Obviously, there will be quite high demand on the one transcontinental route, so airlines

36
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,060
can put a large aircraft, such as the A380, on that route to fulfill its demand.

37
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Since its release, the A380 has often been placed on those long-haul, high-demand routes,

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,200
known as trunk routes.

39
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,260
The second busiest long-haul route in the world, Dubai to London, sees eight A380s a

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,820
day and that's in addition to five smaller planes that fly that route.

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,340
The Dreamliner serves a very different purpose.

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,700
It's a pretty modest sized plane—it can only hold around 220 passengers in a typical

43
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,100
configuration.

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,820
Its composite construction makes it extremely light and fuel efficient which helps reduce

45
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,500
operating costs.

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:07,200
In the late 1990s, Boeing started to see slower sales on their large 747s and 767s and started

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,300
to consider what to build next.

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,860
They initially looked at creating a plane called the Sonic Cruiser which would have

49
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,460
had the same fuel efficiency as conventional aircraft while flying 15% faster—just under

50
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,040
the sound barrier.

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,780
Airlines were initially enthused, however, after the attacks on September 11th and the

52
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,520
rising cost of fuel, airlines asked for fuel efficiency rather than speed.

53
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,760
The 787 delivered on that promise by reaching up to 102 miles per gallon per seat compared

54
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,960
to the A380's paltry 74 miles per gallon per seat.

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:46,280
The Dreamliner also has an absolutely enormous range of up to 8,000 miles and better yet,

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,760
it's efficient at that range.

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,700
Boeing made such a relatively small aircraft because they believe in an entirely different

58
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,800
model of aviation—the point-to-point model.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,960
In this model, in order to get passengers from Hartford to London, airlines just run

60
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,720
a direct flight between Hartford and London.

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,740
Obviously demand would be lower, but there still is demand.

62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,460
In the past, to fly a route like this, an airline would have to use an aircraft with

63
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:17,100
higher capacity than demand because smaller airplanes couldn't fly such a distance non-stop.

64
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,180
Given that, airlines resorted to the hub and spoke model to concentrate all the demand

65
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,340
on certain routes where they could fill large, long-haul planes.

66
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:31,100
Now, with planes like the Dreamliner, airlines can fly long routes with less demand while

67
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,520
still being efficient.

68
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,680
The hub and spoke model was also popular in the past because airlines believed that it

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
was more cost efficient to fly less flights at higher capacity.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,780
It's simple economics really.

71
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,840
Doing a lot of one thing together is cheaper than doing a lot of one thing separately—it's

72
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,200
economies of scale.

73
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,280
Except, that doesn't really extend to the airline industry.

74
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,520
For a larger aircraft you need more ground staff, more flight attendants, more check-in

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,020
agents, more fuel, more of pretty much everything.

76
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,900
The only cost that stays the same is pilots and the only ones reduced are gates and takeoffs.

77
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,020
When you're now doing more flights at the largest, most expensive airports, you end

78
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,860
up spending more money.

79
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,000
Airports like Hartford, Connecticut are cheap—labor is cheap, takeoff fees are cheap, everything

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,720
costs less than at JFK or Newark—there are just fewer flights to compete with.

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,780
Not only that, but flying direct flights clearly costs a ton less because airlines only have

82
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,260
to pay the per-flight costs that I talked about a lot in my why flying is so expensive

83
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,060
video once rather than twice.

84
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,420
United Airlines was a major innovator of the point-to-point model with their Newark hub.

85
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,260
Newark is an airport suited to serve smaller planes so United took the opportunity to open

86
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:51,220
up direct flights to smaller destinations on the British Isles using narrow body planes

87
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,620
stretched to the upper limits of their range.

88
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,380
United primarily uses the Boeing 757 to reach smaller destinations like Shannon, Ireland,

89
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,460
Belfast, Northern Ireland, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Manchester, Newcastle, and Birmingham,

90
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,460
England.

91
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,500
Often, the United flight from Newark is the only transatlantic flight serving these airports.

92
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,060
United is able to operate these routes because the east coast of the US and the British Isles

93
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,940
are just close enough together to reach with a narrow body plane.

94
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,920
With the 787, airlines are able to open even longer routes between smaller destinations.

95
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,740
Routes like these are called long and skinny—long distance but skinny demand.

96
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,760
These include routes like Tokyo to Seattle, London to Chennai, India, Wuhan, China to

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,940
San Francisco, Beijing to Boston, Nairobi, Kenya to Paris, Santiago, Chile to Madrid,

98
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Warsaw, Poland to Beijing, Doha to Edinburgh, Scotland—the list goes on.

99
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,500
The efficiency of this plane has also allowed for an entirely new class of airline—budget

100
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,060
long-haul carriers.

101
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,780
The three main players in this category are Jetstar Airlines based in Australia, Scoot

102
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,540
Airlines based in Singapore, and Norwegian Airlines based in both Scandinavia and London.

103
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,940
Short-haul budget airlines have been possible for a while because of efficient short-range

104
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,700
airplanes, but this really is the first time there has been such an efficient long-haul

105
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:19,220
airplane so these three airlines use the reduction in operating costs to offer significantly

106
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,580
lower ticket prices while also using the principles of budget airlines that I outlined in my how

107
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,340
budget airlines work video.

108
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,260
What's even more exciting for us consumers is the upcoming Boeing 737 MAX.

109
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,020
This plane is a redeveloped version of the long-existing Boeing 737 featuring a larger

110
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,500
capacity, longer range, and higher fuel efficiency.

111
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,140
This means that we could conceivably see super low demand routes like Manchester to Cleveland,

112
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,100
Lyon to New York, and Belfast to DC operated in the near future.

113
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,380
Norwegian Airlines has already hinted at plans to use the 737 MAX to open up an auxiliary

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,660
transatlantic hub in Edinburgh—a relatively small city.

115
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,580
So the A380 was a failure.

116
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,920
Airbus hasn't received a new order in years and it recently announced that it would be

117
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,160
cutting back its production to only 12 a year.

118
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,880
Meanwhile, the 787 has amassed almost 1,200 orders.

119
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,480
Point-to-point flying has always been better for the consumer, but with these recent innovations,

120
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,040
it's now better for airlines too.

121
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:31,560
Given that, it's clear that point-to-point flying is truly the future of aviation.

122
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,280
Alright I have a lot of things to talk about so bear with me, but above all I need to thank

123
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,480
my amazing sponsor, audible.com.

124
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,840
I personally use audible all the time to listen to books on the go.

125
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,560
It's a great way to learn when it'd normally be difficult like when driving, working out,

126
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,080
walking, and more.

127
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,320
Recently I listened to an absolutely amazing sci-fi thriller called Dark Matter by Blake

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Crouch.

129
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,360
It's seriously one of the best I've ever listened to and one of the major scientific

130
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,240
theories used to drive the plot is one that I talked about in a previous video of mine.

131
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,480
Let me know if you figure out which one it is.

132
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,120
You can listen to Dark Matter or one of the other 250,000 titles for free when you sign
