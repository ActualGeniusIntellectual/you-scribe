00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
If you've been alive for the past ten years, you've surely heard of two planes—the

00:05.720 --> 00:09.340
Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

00:09.340 --> 00:14.720
These two planes have dominated new cycles worldwide because they're both intensely

00:14.720 --> 00:15.720
innovative.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.380
The A380 is the largest passenger plane to have ever existed while the Dreamliner is

00:20.380 --> 00:24.820
one of the most efficient and has an unrivaled focus on passenger comfort.

00:24.820 --> 00:30.740
Concealed by all the fanfare, however, is a much deeper story on economics, innovation,

00:30.740 --> 00:33.500
and how the airline industry works.

00:33.500 --> 00:39.780
So, believe it or not, work on the Airbus A380 began back in 1988.

00:39.780 --> 00:43.580
More people were flying than ever and airports weren't getting all that much bigger.

00:43.580 --> 00:48.420
Airbus eyed the success of the Boeing 747 and needed a bigger aircraft to compete.

00:48.420 --> 00:54.020
At first, Airbus considered making a super-wide jet by placing two A340 fuselages side by

00:54.700 --> 00:59.020
but later opted for the design we see today—a fully double-decker jet.

00:59.020 --> 01:05.460
An A380 can hypothetically carry as many as 868 people in an all-economy configuration

01:05.460 --> 01:09.200
although the densest in practice is 615 seats.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.100
This is more than double that of the 787.

01:12.100 --> 01:16.860
Airbus decided to focus on making a high-capacity aircraft because they believed in the hub

01:16.860 --> 01:19.080
and spoke model of aviation.

01:19.080 --> 01:23.540
With the hub and spoke model, passengers traveling from smaller airports—we'll use Hartford

01:24.060 --> 01:28.300
Connecticut as our example—to a long-haul destination, such as London, England, will

01:28.300 --> 01:30.500
need to connect through a hub.

01:30.500 --> 01:34.220
Passengers would likely take a short flight to New York, Atlanta, or Chicago to catch

01:34.220 --> 01:36.180
their transatlantic flight to London.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.780
Obviously this is inefficient for the passenger.

01:38.780 --> 01:43.020
On almost all routings between Hartford and London, passengers have to fly away from their

01:43.020 --> 01:46.020
destination in order to catch their transatlantic flight.

01:46.020 --> 01:49.300
However, for airlines, there's conceivably an advantage.

01:49.740 --> 01:53.980
Let's say, just for the sake of explanation, there are only six airports in the entire

01:53.980 --> 02:00.660
United States—New York, Boston, DC, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.

02:00.660 --> 02:05.180
If an airline had one flight from every destination to every other destination, they would need

02:05.180 --> 02:07.800
to run 16 routes.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.980
If they just have one hub airport on each coast—we'll say New York and LA—they

02:11.980 --> 02:16.860
just need to have one route from each secondary airport to each hub and one transcontinental

02:16.860 --> 02:19.400
hub to hub route—five in total.

02:19.400 --> 02:23.940
Obviously, there will be quite high demand on the one transcontinental route, so airlines

02:23.940 --> 02:29.060
can put a large aircraft, such as the A380, on that route to fulfill its demand.

02:29.060 --> 02:34.060
Since its release, the A380 has often been placed on those long-haul, high-demand routes,

02:34.060 --> 02:35.200
known as trunk routes.

02:35.200 --> 02:40.260
The second busiest long-haul route in the world, Dubai to London, sees eight A380s a

02:40.260 --> 02:44.820
day and that's in addition to five smaller planes that fly that route.

02:44.820 --> 02:47.340
The Dreamliner serves a very different purpose.

02:47.340 --> 02:52.700
It's a pretty modest sized plane—it can only hold around 220 passengers in a typical

02:52.700 --> 02:54.100
configuration.

02:54.100 --> 02:58.820
Its composite construction makes it extremely light and fuel efficient which helps reduce

02:58.820 --> 03:00.500
operating costs.

03:00.500 --> 03:07.200
In the late 1990s, Boeing started to see slower sales on their large 747s and 767s and started

03:07.200 --> 03:09.300
to consider what to build next.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.860
They initially looked at creating a plane called the Sonic Cruiser which would have

03:12.860 --> 03:18.460
had the same fuel efficiency as conventional aircraft while flying 15% faster—just under

03:18.460 --> 03:20.040
the sound barrier.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.780
Airlines were initially enthused, however, after the attacks on September 11th and the

03:23.780 --> 03:28.520
rising cost of fuel, airlines asked for fuel efficiency rather than speed.

03:28.520 --> 03:34.760
The 787 delivered on that promise by reaching up to 102 miles per gallon per seat compared

03:34.760 --> 03:38.960
to the A380's paltry 74 miles per gallon per seat.

03:38.960 --> 03:46.280
The Dreamliner also has an absolutely enormous range of up to 8,000 miles and better yet,

03:46.280 --> 03:48.760
it's efficient at that range.

03:48.760 --> 03:53.700
Boeing made such a relatively small aircraft because they believe in an entirely different

03:53.700 --> 03:56.800
model of aviation—the point-to-point model.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.960
In this model, in order to get passengers from Hartford to London, airlines just run

04:00.960 --> 04:03.720
a direct flight between Hartford and London.

04:03.720 --> 04:07.740
Obviously demand would be lower, but there still is demand.

04:07.740 --> 04:11.460
In the past, to fly a route like this, an airline would have to use an aircraft with

04:11.460 --> 04:17.100
higher capacity than demand because smaller airplanes couldn't fly such a distance non-stop.

04:17.100 --> 04:21.180
Given that, airlines resorted to the hub and spoke model to concentrate all the demand

04:21.180 --> 04:25.340
on certain routes where they could fill large, long-haul planes.

04:25.340 --> 04:31.100
Now, with planes like the Dreamliner, airlines can fly long routes with less demand while

04:31.100 --> 04:33.520
still being efficient.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.680
The hub and spoke model was also popular in the past because airlines believed that it

04:37.680 --> 04:41.360
was more cost efficient to fly less flights at higher capacity.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.780
It's simple economics really.

04:43.780 --> 04:48.840
Doing a lot of one thing together is cheaper than doing a lot of one thing separately—it's

04:48.840 --> 04:50.200
economies of scale.

04:50.200 --> 04:54.280
Except, that doesn't really extend to the airline industry.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.520
For a larger aircraft you need more ground staff, more flight attendants, more check-in

04:58.520 --> 05:02.020
agents, more fuel, more of pretty much everything.

05:02.020 --> 05:07.900
The only cost that stays the same is pilots and the only ones reduced are gates and takeoffs.

05:07.900 --> 05:12.020
When you're now doing more flights at the largest, most expensive airports, you end

05:12.020 --> 05:13.860
up spending more money.

05:13.860 --> 05:19.000
Airports like Hartford, Connecticut are cheap—labor is cheap, takeoff fees are cheap, everything

05:19.000 --> 05:23.720
costs less than at JFK or Newark—there are just fewer flights to compete with.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.780
Not only that, but flying direct flights clearly costs a ton less because airlines only have

05:28.780 --> 05:33.260
to pay the per-flight costs that I talked about a lot in my why flying is so expensive

05:33.260 --> 05:36.060
video once rather than twice.

05:36.060 --> 05:41.420
United Airlines was a major innovator of the point-to-point model with their Newark hub.

05:41.420 --> 05:46.260
Newark is an airport suited to serve smaller planes so United took the opportunity to open

05:46.260 --> 05:51.220
up direct flights to smaller destinations on the British Isles using narrow body planes

05:51.220 --> 05:53.620
stretched to the upper limits of their range.

05:53.940 --> 05:59.380
United primarily uses the Boeing 757 to reach smaller destinations like Shannon, Ireland,

05:59.380 --> 06:05.460
Belfast, Northern Ireland, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Manchester, Newcastle, and Birmingham,

06:05.460 --> 06:06.460
England.

06:06.460 --> 06:11.500
Often, the United flight from Newark is the only transatlantic flight serving these airports.

06:11.500 --> 06:16.060
United is able to operate these routes because the east coast of the US and the British Isles

06:16.060 --> 06:19.940
are just close enough together to reach with a narrow body plane.

06:19.940 --> 06:25.920
With the 787, airlines are able to open even longer routes between smaller destinations.

06:25.920 --> 06:30.740
Routes like these are called long and skinny—long distance but skinny demand.

06:30.740 --> 06:35.760
These include routes like Tokyo to Seattle, London to Chennai, India, Wuhan, China to

06:35.760 --> 06:42.940
San Francisco, Beijing to Boston, Nairobi, Kenya to Paris, Santiago, Chile to Madrid,

06:42.940 --> 06:47.940
Warsaw, Poland to Beijing, Doha to Edinburgh, Scotland—the list goes on.

06:47.940 --> 06:53.500
The efficiency of this plane has also allowed for an entirely new class of airline—budget

06:53.500 --> 06:55.060
long-haul carriers.

06:55.060 --> 06:59.780
The three main players in this category are Jetstar Airlines based in Australia, Scoot

06:59.780 --> 07:05.540
Airlines based in Singapore, and Norwegian Airlines based in both Scandinavia and London.

07:05.540 --> 07:09.940
Short-haul budget airlines have been possible for a while because of efficient short-range

07:09.940 --> 07:13.700
airplanes, but this really is the first time there has been such an efficient long-haul

07:13.700 --> 07:19.220
airplane so these three airlines use the reduction in operating costs to offer significantly

07:19.220 --> 07:24.580
lower ticket prices while also using the principles of budget airlines that I outlined in my how

07:24.580 --> 07:26.340
budget airlines work video.

07:26.340 --> 07:32.260
What's even more exciting for us consumers is the upcoming Boeing 737 MAX.

07:32.260 --> 07:38.020
This plane is a redeveloped version of the long-existing Boeing 737 featuring a larger

07:38.020 --> 07:41.500
capacity, longer range, and higher fuel efficiency.

07:41.500 --> 07:47.140
This means that we could conceivably see super low demand routes like Manchester to Cleveland,

07:47.140 --> 07:52.100
Lyon to New York, and Belfast to DC operated in the near future.

07:52.100 --> 07:57.380
Norwegian Airlines has already hinted at plans to use the 737 MAX to open up an auxiliary

07:57.380 --> 08:01.660
transatlantic hub in Edinburgh—a relatively small city.

08:01.660 --> 08:04.580
So the A380 was a failure.

08:04.580 --> 08:08.920
Airbus hasn't received a new order in years and it recently announced that it would be

08:08.920 --> 08:12.160
cutting back its production to only 12 a year.

08:12.160 --> 08:17.880
Meanwhile, the 787 has amassed almost 1,200 orders.

08:17.880 --> 08:22.480
Point-to-point flying has always been better for the consumer, but with these recent innovations,

08:22.480 --> 08:25.040
it's now better for airlines too.

08:25.040 --> 08:31.560
Given that, it's clear that point-to-point flying is truly the future of aviation.

08:31.560 --> 08:36.280
Alright I have a lot of things to talk about so bear with me, but above all I need to thank

08:36.280 --> 08:39.480
my amazing sponsor, audible.com.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.840
I personally use audible all the time to listen to books on the go.

08:42.840 --> 08:47.560
It's a great way to learn when it'd normally be difficult like when driving, working out,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.080
walking, and more.

08:49.080 --> 08:54.320
Recently I listened to an absolutely amazing sci-fi thriller called Dark Matter by Blake

08:54.320 --> 08:55.320
Crouch.

08:55.320 --> 08:59.360
It's seriously one of the best I've ever listened to and one of the major scientific

08:59.360 --> 09:04.240
theories used to drive the plot is one that I talked about in a previous video of mine.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.480
Let me know if you figure out which one it is.

09:06.480 --> 09:12.120
