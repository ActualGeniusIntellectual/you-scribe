1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
This is one of the most opulent airports in the world—Sarinara Airstrip.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,560
It's composed of one small, unimpressive terminal, a 7,000-foot dirt runway, and yet

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,720
it sees dozens of flights per day and an average net worth of those traveling through it higher

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,080
than almost any other in the world.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:22,800
That's because this tiny airstrip is the gateway to the massive Serengeti National

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,560
Park—a safari destination so storied, so legendary, that it's one of only a handful

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
globally that the average person might recognize by name.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,040
For the fanciest few, their touchdown is met with a heavily modified Toyota Land Cruiser,

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,520
quickly whisking them away, across the savanna, to the four-season Safari Lodge,

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,680
one of the most expensive outposts of one of the most expensive hotel chains.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,520
Rooms demand a minimum of $1,100 a night, and minimum is the key word there.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,640
In peak season, during the Great Migration, the same rooms will near $3,000, and the most

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,000
expensive, the three-bedroom Presidential Villa, demands over $10,000 per night.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,640
With a pool, spa, gym, multiple bars and restaurants, and plenty of optional activities

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,480
for an upcharge, the lodge has everything you'd expect from a hotel of its caliber,

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,800
but perhaps not a hotel here—hours away from anywhere, surrounded on all sides by

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,960
seemingly endless savanna.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,480
But zoom out just ever so slightly more, and it becomes clear that the four-season Serengeti

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,080
is hardly alone.

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,160
The National Park is home to over a dozen five-star hotels, some of which best even

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,920
the four seasons' prices.

22
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
Camps like the one-nature hotel Nyar Zuiga, for example, sell a night in their most affordable

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,960
luxury tents for at least $3,000.

24
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,040
Serengeti National Park has developed into the destination for luxury Safaris, and so

25
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,160
the remote stretch of savanna has become a bizarrely busy hotspot for the world rich

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,720
and famous.

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,120
And yet, zoom out once again, and it all starts to seem even more ludicrous.

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,440
The Serengeti is located in Tanzania, a sub-Saharan African country that, according to World Bank

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,480
estimates, is the 30th poorest in the world on a GDP per capita basis.

30
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:15,360
Average income is $1,099 per year, almost exactly equal to the cheapest night in the

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
cheapest room at that four seasons.

32
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,560
The region that encompasses it, Mara, is even poorer than that national average, despite

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,640
tourism's boost, so for its residents, if they were to take a quick trip into the park

34
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,720
and up to the lodge, a salad at the restaurant would equate to four and a half days of income,

35
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
a chicken sandwich about six, and a main course would demand some eight days of labor.

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,000
This degree of difference just feels wrong.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,720
There's something about such a stark degree of income inequality in such a close proximity

38
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,520
that conjures up concerns of exploitation.

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,160
But beyond the emotions of it, beyond the near primal instincts of perceiving rich people

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,720
in poor places as wrong, is it?

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,520
Well, you probably already intuitively know the broad upsides and downsides.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,840
For example, many who live in this remote region are now able to earn a living serving

43
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,560
as guides for the ultra-wealthy, touring their ancestral home-turned-pristine, unpopulated

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,600
wilderness.

45
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,440
Of course, that brings up the fact that they were kicked off the land in the first place,

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,600
but a land without people, on the other hand, is of a measurable benefit to the animals,

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,520
and for their part, while the animals largely go free, they still have the occasional safari

48
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,960
party to navigate.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Human presence stresses elephants, getting too near feeding cheetah leads to the skittish

50
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,960
cat abandoning the kill, and normalizing the presence of humans doesn't serve any animal's

51
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,320
best interest once it inadvertently wanders into a hunting preserve.

52
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,320
But ultimately, human presence is what drives the revenue that makes the park possible to

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,960
begin with.

54
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,320
And then the side effect this creates is the country's tourism industry, which relies

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,240
on the park to bring customers in.

56
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,280
In this system, there are undeniable trade-offs.

57
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,200
People are kicked off their land, animals are poked, prodded, and tamed for tourists,

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,280
and the seized areas are quietly developed into nature theme parks managed by governments

59
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
with spotty track records.

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,960
But this is what the rest of the world relies on to protect dwindling species and shrinking

61
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,360
natural wonders only left in Africa.

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,800
It's certainly a compromise.

63
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,680
In fact, it's outright unfair to some.

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,160
And while it's easy to recognize the moral trade-off that undergirds photo-safaris, it's

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,320
tough to critically examine because, when brought down to the individual level, it's

66
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,840
such a small downside for such a small upside.

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,480
No single person is making a meaningful difference, positive or negative.

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,400
It's the phenomenon that does.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,200
So, perhaps it's more useful to examine this trade-off in starker form—a near-equivalent

70
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:43,440
where individuals make the same moral trade-off, but with an enormous life-or-death difference.

71
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,120
Safari Hunting

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
You can legally kill almost any animal in Africa—for a price.

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,360
Zebras, giraffes, buffaloes, hippos, cheetahs, lions, elephants, and even the critically

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:04,640
endangered white rhino, of which only 6,000 exist, upon purchase of a $350,000 permit.

75
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,760
Tanzania, one of the top trophy hunting destinations, regulates and publishes a remarkably

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,120
specific price list for buying the right to kill its wildlife.

77
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,600
The ever-present otter only costs some $170, the abundant yet enormous hippo goes for $1,500,

78
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,480
and then you get into the rare species.

79
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,040
Leopards fetch a $4,500 fee, lions some $7,000, and the top price in Tanzania is bestowed

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,000
to the elephant, an endangered species known for its highly valuable ivory tusks, which

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,200
justifies the $20,000 trophy hunting fee to bag those with the largest tusks.

82
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,880
Such commodification of the world's rarest and most beloved species draws up immense

83
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,640
emotion—it feels like a failure of humanity.

84
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,280
Historically, humans hunted these species into near-nonexistence, then they stole their

85
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,920
habitats to turn them into farms and fields and cities, and then after all that, after

86
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,000
facing the precipice of extinction, they put a price on their lives.

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:07,600
Their protectors, the authorities in charge of keeping them safe in a world that structurally

88
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,480
imperils them, have signed up on their deaths, all to have them skinned, stretched onto a

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,640
mannequin, then mounted above a Texan's fireplace to serve as a talking point at dinner

90
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,800
parties, kicking off the conversation about the time they went on safari in the Serengeti.

91
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,760
It feels tragic.

92
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,480
However, in certain circumstances, tragedy can minimize tragedy.

93
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,560
You see, as unfortunate as it may be, pure conservation can't exist today.

94
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,640
Animals in Africa, or anywhere, cannot live as they did in centuries past, because the

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,280
human population has exploded and spread to every corner of the globe.

96
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,800
Excluding the most barren, dry, inhospitable reaches, essentially any land has value in

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,880
the human economic system—certainly in a fertile, agriculturally productive place like

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,360
Tanzania, there is always a way to turn a profit off of any swath of open land, and

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,920
therefore it's always under threat.

100
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,800
In rural areas, agriculture is the driving force behind the destruction of wilderness.

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Beyond just fields for farming, there's cattle grazing—letting livestock forage for their

102
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
food is cost-efficient compared to paying for feed, assuming the grazing land is cheap

103
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
enough.

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,960
Inherently, almost any stretch of land that can sustain wild animals can also sustain

105
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,440
cattle, and with virtually endless demand for beef, there's always incentive for farmers

106
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
to gobble up more land if the price is right.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,760
So, nowadays, there is no such thing as valueless land, and correspondingly, there is no free

108
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,640
land.

109
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,440
The problem that presents for humans is that, uninhibited, essentially everything would

110
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,400
be turned into something, and any human use of land presents an issue for wild animals,

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,720
as even something as simple as cattle grazing leads to diminished resources and disrupted

112
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,400
ecosystems, which makes it tougher and tougher for already endangered wild animals to survive.

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,200
But animals don't interact with our economy.

114
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Their habitats have tremendous existential value for them, just as ours do for us, but

115
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,640
they're competing against a system in which that value is not incorporated.

116
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,280
Therefore, when you distribute land through a capitalistic, supply-and-demand-driven model,

117
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,440
you have to work against that model to save these habitats.

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,200
That's the role of conservation.

119
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:27,440
You take land and specify its use as disuse, but conservation has a cost—not just to set

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,080
up, but perhaps more importantly, to enforce.

121
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Serengeti National Park is massive—in fact, it's larger than the entire nation of Qatar.

122
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,800
Without enforcement, it'd be very easy for a farmer to bring their cattle in for illegal

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
grazing and go undetected, and that's hardly the biggest threat.

124
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,240
Many of the animals, directly due to their scarcity, are worth eye-popping amounts.

125
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,320
For example, a single rhino horn is estimated to sell for $100,000 to $300,000 on the black

126
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,400
market, where in countries like China and Vietnam, the crushed-up form of it is perceived

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,800
to be a powerful tool as a traditional medicine.

128
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,720
Back in Tanzania, with its average annual income of $1100, that's a truly life-changing

129
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,440
sum of money, so there's enormous incentive to illegally hunt and dehorn the animal.

130
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,880
While that's the most extreme example, there's also plenty of profit to be made

131
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,360
by killing elephants, lions, cheetahs, and other rare and endangered species in protected

132
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,240
areas like the Serengeti, so proper conservation requires effective spending on enforcement

133
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,400
across a huge swath of land.

134
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,280
So that's all to say, conservation in the 21st century can't be passive.

135
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,440
It has to be an active process, and therefore, it demands a very real, sometimes significant,

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,920
cost.

137
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,880
Tanzania, and essentially every major safari destination in Africa, is not a wealthy place.

138
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,960
The government does not have bounds of money to throw around, especially when their human

139
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,640
population faces myriad life-or-death issues that can be solved rather simply with government

140
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,140
spending.

141
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,240
So, trophy hunting works as a tragic, but possibly effective, bargain—giving animals

142
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,320
a means to generate economic value in our economic system in situations where, regrettably,

143
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
there are few practical alternatives.

144
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,760
There are a huge number of hunters around the world who are willing to pay $20,000 to

145
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,000
kill an elephant, and $20,000 can go a very, very long way in saving other elephants from

146
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,320
habitat destruction, poaching, and more.

147
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,000
The concept, therefore, is clear—kill one to save more than one.

148
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,920
From a pragmatic, utilitarian perspective, this is a worthy bargain.

149
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,000
And when you put it in a real-world context, the case is bolstered further.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,680
Guiding hunting trips is an exceptionally good employment opportunity for those living

151
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,080
around conservation areas, and even offers a legitimate use for the skills a former poacher

152
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,200
might have acquired.

153
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
Trophy hunting can typically only happen on certain land with an approved guide, for which

154
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
hunters pay enormous sums.

155
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,680
A 21-day hunt in Tanzania typically costs $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 all in per person,

156
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,760
and then it costs more to get extra permits to kill more than what's included in that

157
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,280
government-regulated package.

158
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,920
It's also an exceptionally strong mechanism for generating conservation revenue in places

159
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,840
that might be too dangerous or undeveloped for a competitive photosafari industry.

160
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,200
For example, Mozambique has a healthy safari hunting industry, despite just a minor photosafari

161
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,920
one.

162
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,760
And then, there are the case studies.

163
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,400
South Africa has an oft-toted story of boosting its white rhino population from the dozens

164
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,960
to the thousand through trophy hunting, Zimbabwe used the industry to double its conservation

165
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,920
lands, and Tanzania itself insists that the industry is a critical factor in its abnormally

166
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,600
high lion population.

167
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,880
Theoretically, trophy hunting can, objectively, create more good than bad.

168
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,640
It can be a tragedy that minimizes tragedy.

169
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:57,200
It only takes a simple understanding of the system to understand that.

170
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,040
But does it balance out?

171
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,800
Well, like a frustrating many of things, it depends on who you ask.

172
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,400
In fact, one of the fiercest debates centers around the fact that one would think would

173
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,240
be the easiest to confirm—how much revenue trophy hunting creates.

174
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,800
For example, the Safari Club International, a US-based organization that, according to

175
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,480
its mission statement, seeks to quote,

176
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
"...protect the freedom to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation," boasts that trophy

177
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,480
hunting contributes $426 million annually to the GDP of these eight southern African

178
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
economies.

179
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
That number originates in a study they commissioned from Southwick Associates, a Florida-based

180
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,160
market research firm that, according to its own website, proudly supports pro-gun organizations

181
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,760
like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and also states that their quote,

182
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,600
"...economic impact analysis calculates the importance an activity or initiative has on

183
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,000
the economy or quality of life of a region, generating greater support for that activity."

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
And this study certainly generated that support, putting forward one of the highest economic

185
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,760
impact estimates of any purportedly legitimate study to date.

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,440
In response, the Humane Society International, which does not hide its position against trophy

187
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,400
hunting, commissioned its own study by Australia-based economists at large, which laid out numerous

188
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,200
methodological errors in the Southwick analysis.

189
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,880
The overall structure of the Southwick study involves surveying hunters on their in-country

190
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
spending, multiplying that by the total number of hunter-visitors, then adding a multiplier

191
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,080
to that to inflate it to a corresponding GDP figure.

192
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,480
From the very start, Southwick reached an eye-popping $20,602 estimate of in-country

193
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
spending per hunter.

194
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,640
While plenty of hunters pay for the most expensive elephant, lion, or cheetah permits, far more

195
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:39,040
engaged in shorter, cheaper hunts for less dangerous game, which in most other studies

196
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,280
has pulled the average down far below this $20,000 figure.

197
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,240
In fact, even their own data indicates a strong sampling bias, as they divided their survey

198
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,520
into three rounds.

199
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,240
The first two found an average of about $16,000 in spend, then the third reached $25,600 — a

200
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,720
60% inflation, which properly sampled studies should not see.

201
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,600
And perhaps more fundamentally, the Southwick study considered trophy hunting entirely in

202
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,320
isolation, assuming that exactly zero income would occur from the land, businesses, and

203
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,520
visitors engaging in the industry if it didn't occur.

204
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,800
That is clearly false, and such a basic failure in the process of economic impact analysis

205
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,160
that it's covered in the second paragraph of its Wikipedia page.

206
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,080
That would be like arguing that you've created economic benefit by selling scrap metal, even

207
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,880
when it came from demolishing a perfectly good building.

208
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,200
Southwick itself admitted that 11% of its surveyed hunters would still have traveled

209
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,200
to the destination country if not for trophy hunting, and yet they attribute all of the

210
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:42,160
revenue these brought to trophy hunting, even when much of it would have happened otherwise.

211
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,000
Again, they've completely ignored the counterfactual case because it was convenient to their client.

212
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,240
The study also found that only about 5% of total in-country spending was attributable

213
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,280
to non-hunting related activities, which is far lower than the 30 or 40% found in previous

214
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,600
studies, and then with this already deflated amount, they still attributed that spending

215
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,480
to hunting itself, further boosting the figures.

216
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,760
Issues like this mount and mount, so economists at large revised and corrected the methodology

217
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,960
to create their own economic impact estimate—$132 million, less than a third of what Southwick

218
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,680
posited.

219
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,600
While other studies seem to converge on a number more in the 200s, the point is less

220
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
about a systematic over- or under-exaggeration, but more so about the inherent inability to

221
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,160
actually reach any confident consensus on the economic effect of trophy hunting on GDP.

222
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,640
But trophy hunting is not even supposed to be about GDP growth—it's not supposed to

223
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,200
be a system designed for economic growth.

224
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,760
That can be a nice side effect, but the bargain is about sacrificing the few for the many

225
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,840
on behalf of the animals.

226
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Establishing a figure of how much revenue actually ends up used for conservation has

227
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,960
proven even tougher, and concerningly, even Southwick suggested that only some $27 to

228
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,920
$40 million of their purported $426 million went to conservation.

229
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,240
That means that a $7,000 line in Tanzania has unwillingly sacrificed at least $6,300

230
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,560
of itself for humans and only $700 for its brethren.

231
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,200
At the simplest, least academic level, the systematic slaughter of a species of only

232
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:21,680
20,000 globally for only $700 in benefit to that species is a much tougher bargain to

233
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,240
argue for.

234
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,000
There is a world in which trophy hunting works, but when you dig into it, it's increasingly

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,240
difficult to believe it's this one.

236
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,880
It's a theoretically viable concept that has crashed head-on into the dirty, difficult

237
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,320
realities of a flawed world, and that increasingly operates as a profit-generation device rather

238
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
than a pragmatic bargain.

239
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,960
So, when coming back down to the less destructive bargain, photosafaris, it's clear that it's

240
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,120
less useful to look at it from the basis of its theoretical underpinnings, and more so

241
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,200
its real-world realities.

242
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,720
In Tanzania, photosafaris and their rising popularity through the lens of conservation

243
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,360
are becoming increasingly problematic.

244
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,520
In the past two decades, the annual number of international tourists in Tanzania has

245
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,600
tripled, while the country's total tourism receipts have surpassed that of Kenya, their

246
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,240
northern neighbor with a more mature tourism sector.

247
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,920
That means more people than ever are spending more than ever to visit.

248
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,280
This increased allure has set off a land race and development boom across northern Tanzania.

249
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,200
Luxury resorts like the Four Seasons aren't confined to Serengeti National Park, but are

250
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,280
instead spread across the area.

251
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,680
This network of tour companies, roads, airstrips, national parks, and conservation areas from

252
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,400
Mount Kilimanjaro to the Serengeti is now so well established that it has its own name—the

253
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
Northern Circuit.

254
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,840
The rise of the Northern Circuit has made it clear that in Tanzania, tourism doesn't

255
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,080
serve conservation, but rather, conservation serves tourism.

256
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,400
Within Tanzania's park system, further and further development seem an opportunity they're

257
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,720
trying hard to capitalize on, as each year they release an annual investment prospectus

258
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,200
for those who might be entertaining the idea of building a lodge within the park's boundaries.

259
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,840
The parks are undeniably changing, but this new age scramble for Africa is being most

260
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,160
acutely felt in the lands directly around the parks, where wildlife still roams, but

261
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,000
regulations are more relaxed and restrictions remain relatively loose.

262
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,920
Some companies, like Dorobo Safaris, have entered mutually beneficial agreements to

263
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,920
lease from and work with the local Maasai people to establish wildlife-watching services

264
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,040
outside of the park.

265
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:24,560
Others have opted instead to work with the Tanzanian government directly to establish

266
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,160
safari or hunting reserves.

267
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,480
The UAE-owned Oterlo Business Corporation, for instance, relied on close connections

268
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,800
to the Tanzanian government to create a hunting resort here, and government forced to relocate

269
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
locals once they began to expand.

270
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Regardless of how they go about it, and regardless of their reputations, developers and outfitters

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,880
are riding the region's newfound notoriety, putting pressure on locals, and forever altering

272
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,200
the very landscapes driving the region's rise in popularity.

273
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,840
For the sake of pure conservation, tourism's proving too successful.

274
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,320
It's leading to more roads, more airstrips, more suspect private entities running hunting

275
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,000
reserves and safari lodges.

276
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's leading to strife between local populations and Tanzania's federal government that it

277
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,640
has the potential to destabilize the region.

278
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,200
The downstream effect of this land rush is a landscape marred by shining new resorts,

279
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,600
freshly cut roadways, and burned down villages monitored by officials stretched too thin,

280
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,040
and supervised by a federal government with a spotty record.

281
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,920
Northern Tanzania is quickly becoming a landscape where the rules of conservation take a backseat

282
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,800
to the economic potential that Africa's brilliant biodiversity affords.

283
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,240
Moral bargains can seem effective when discussed theoretically, but then you go from concept

284
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
to reality.

285
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,680
For decades upon decades, Serengeti National Park has conserved its land, so simply, it's

286
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,040
tough to recognize how this recent buildup, this ruination, has equivalently worked to

287
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,200
further that conservation mission.

288
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,840
And this seems to be a moment that most moral bargains reach, when the side effect, the

289
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,440
bonus revenue-seeking justification that enables the bargain, becomes a disconnected, profit-seeking

290
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,160
motive.

291
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,000
This happens slowly, quietly, and then suddenly, one takes a look back, and a theoretical good

292
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
has taken an entirely different form.

293
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,640
Therefore, any bargain is only as effective as those maintaining and enforcing the bargain.

294
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,240
Safaris are no different.

295
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,080
There's no slam dunk, there's no this is bad and this is good.

296
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,000
It's rather a reminder of the value of nuance, a reminder that this, like any bargain, is

297
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,400
defined by the boring, quiet, unglamorous task of enforcing it.

298
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
Scarcity drives value.

299
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,000
That's almost universally true, and it's certainly the case with domain names.

300
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,920
There can only be one instance of a given domain, and so especially when that domain

301
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:47,520
uniquely matters to you, it's hugely valuable to you.

302
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,240
For example, you might want to own yourlastname.com, but once it's gone, it's gone, and if you

303
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,240
ever really, really want it, you'd probably have to pay a domain squatter a huge fee to

304
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,280
get it—unless you just get it now.

305
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,800
That's always been my approach with domains, so whenever I land on a name for a new channel,

306
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,360
for example, even if it's still just a concept, I head to our sponsor, Hover, to buy it now,

307
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,400
before it's gone.

308
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,480
The reason I've always used Hover is because I know they have fair, transparent pricing,

309
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,840
a super quick and easy purchase process, and if there's ever the need, they truly

310
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,360
have some of the best customer support of any business I've used.

311
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,600
They also allow you to get creative with your domain, with over 400 domain extensions that

312
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,560
allow you to land on something like our Wendover.productions domain.

313
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,880
People are always blown away that that's actually our domain, without any .com or .org,

314
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,040
and the way I found that was with Hover.

315
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,280
We also use them for our company email addresses, since you can set up a custom, professional-looking

316
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,120
