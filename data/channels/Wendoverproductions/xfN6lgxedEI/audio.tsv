0	5200	This is one of the most opulent airports in the world—Sarinara Airstrip.
5200	10560	It's composed of one small, unimpressive terminal, a 7,000-foot dirt runway, and yet
10560	14720	it sees dozens of flights per day and an average net worth of those traveling through it higher
14720	17080	than almost any other in the world.
17080	22800	That's because this tiny airstrip is the gateway to the massive Serengeti National
22800	28560	Park—a safari destination so storied, so legendary, that it's one of only a handful
28640	32000	globally that the average person might recognize by name.
32560	37040	For the fanciest few, their touchdown is met with a heavily modified Toyota Land Cruiser,
37040	41520	quickly whisking them away, across the savanna, to the four-season Safari Lodge,
41520	45680	one of the most expensive outposts of one of the most expensive hotel chains.
45680	51520	Rooms demand a minimum of $1,100 a night, and minimum is the key word there.
51520	56640	In peak season, during the Great Migration, the same rooms will near $3,000, and the most
56640	62000	expensive, the three-bedroom Presidential Villa, demands over $10,000 per night.
62000	66640	With a pool, spa, gym, multiple bars and restaurants, and plenty of optional activities
66640	70480	for an upcharge, the lodge has everything you'd expect from a hotel of its caliber,
70480	76800	but perhaps not a hotel here—hours away from anywhere, surrounded on all sides by
76800	78960	seemingly endless savanna.
79680	84480	But zoom out just ever so slightly more, and it becomes clear that the four-season Serengeti
84480	86080	is hardly alone.
86080	90160	The National Park is home to over a dozen five-star hotels, some of which best even
90160	91920	the four seasons' prices.
91920	96640	Camps like the one-nature hotel Nyar Zuiga, for example, sell a night in their most affordable
96640	98960	luxury tents for at least $3,000.
100080	105040	Serengeti National Park has developed into the destination for luxury Safaris, and so
105040	110160	the remote stretch of savanna has become a bizarrely busy hotspot for the world rich
110160	110720	and famous.
111520	117120	And yet, zoom out once again, and it all starts to seem even more ludicrous.
117680	123440	The Serengeti is located in Tanzania, a sub-Saharan African country that, according to World Bank
123440	128480	estimates, is the 30th poorest in the world on a GDP per capita basis.
128480	135360	Average income is $1,099 per year, almost exactly equal to the cheapest night in the
135360	137680	cheapest room at that four seasons.
137680	142560	The region that encompasses it, Mara, is even poorer than that national average, despite
142560	146640	tourism's boost, so for its residents, if they were to take a quick trip into the park
146640	150720	and up to the lodge, a salad at the restaurant would equate to four and a half days of income,
150720	155280	a chicken sandwich about six, and a main course would demand some eight days of labor.
155920	160000	This degree of difference just feels wrong.
160000	164720	There's something about such a stark degree of income inequality in such a close proximity
164720	167520	that conjures up concerns of exploitation.
167520	172160	But beyond the emotions of it, beyond the near primal instincts of perceiving rich people
172160	174720	in poor places as wrong, is it?
175600	181520	Well, you probably already intuitively know the broad upsides and downsides.
181520	185840	For example, many who live in this remote region are now able to earn a living serving
185840	190560	as guides for the ultra-wealthy, touring their ancestral home-turned-pristine, unpopulated
190560	191600	wilderness.
191600	195440	Of course, that brings up the fact that they were kicked off the land in the first place,
195440	199600	but a land without people, on the other hand, is of a measurable benefit to the animals,
199600	203520	and for their part, while the animals largely go free, they still have the occasional safari
203520	204960	party to navigate.
204960	208800	Human presence stresses elephants, getting too near feeding cheetah leads to the skittish
208800	212960	cat abandoning the kill, and normalizing the presence of humans doesn't serve any animal's
212960	216320	best interest once it inadvertently wanders into a hunting preserve.
216320	220320	But ultimately, human presence is what drives the revenue that makes the park possible to
220320	220960	begin with.
220960	224320	And then the side effect this creates is the country's tourism industry, which relies
224320	226240	on the park to bring customers in.
226240	229280	In this system, there are undeniable trade-offs.
229280	233200	People are kicked off their land, animals are poked, prodded, and tamed for tourists,
233200	237280	and the seized areas are quietly developed into nature theme parks managed by governments
237280	239120	with spotty track records.
239120	242960	But this is what the rest of the world relies on to protect dwindling species and shrinking
242960	245360	natural wonders only left in Africa.
246080	248800	It's certainly a compromise.
248800	251680	In fact, it's outright unfair to some.
251680	256160	And while it's easy to recognize the moral trade-off that undergirds photo-safaris, it's
256160	260320	tough to critically examine because, when brought down to the individual level, it's
260320	263840	such a small downside for such a small upside.
263840	268480	No single person is making a meaningful difference, positive or negative.
268480	270400	It's the phenomenon that does.
271040	277200	So, perhaps it's more useful to examine this trade-off in starker form—a near-equivalent
277200	283440	where individuals make the same moral trade-off, but with an enormous life-or-death difference.
284160	285120	Safari Hunting
286000	291120	You can legally kill almost any animal in Africa—for a price.
291680	297360	Zebras, giraffes, buffaloes, hippos, cheetahs, lions, elephants, and even the critically
297360	304640	endangered white rhino, of which only 6,000 exist, upon purchase of a $350,000 permit.
304640	309760	Tanzania, one of the top trophy hunting destinations, regulates and publishes a remarkably
309760	313120	specific price list for buying the right to kill its wildlife.
313120	319600	The ever-present otter only costs some $170, the abundant yet enormous hippo goes for $1,500,
319600	322480	and then you get into the rare species.
322480	329040	Leopards fetch a $4,500 fee, lions some $7,000, and the top price in Tanzania is bestowed
329040	334000	to the elephant, an endangered species known for its highly valuable ivory tusks, which
334000	339200	justifies the $20,000 trophy hunting fee to bag those with the largest tusks.
339760	344880	Such commodification of the world's rarest and most beloved species draws up immense
344880	348640	emotion—it feels like a failure of humanity.
348640	353280	Historically, humans hunted these species into near-nonexistence, then they stole their
353280	357920	habitats to turn them into farms and fields and cities, and then after all that, after
357920	362000	facing the precipice of extinction, they put a price on their lives.
362640	367600	Their protectors, the authorities in charge of keeping them safe in a world that structurally
367600	372480	imperils them, have signed up on their deaths, all to have them skinned, stretched onto a
372480	376640	mannequin, then mounted above a Texan's fireplace to serve as a talking point at dinner
376640	380800	parties, kicking off the conversation about the time they went on safari in the Serengeti.
381360	383760	It feels tragic.
384640	390480	However, in certain circumstances, tragedy can minimize tragedy.
391040	396560	You see, as unfortunate as it may be, pure conservation can't exist today.
397120	402640	Animals in Africa, or anywhere, cannot live as they did in centuries past, because the
402640	407280	human population has exploded and spread to every corner of the globe.
407280	412800	Excluding the most barren, dry, inhospitable reaches, essentially any land has value in
412800	416880	the human economic system—certainly in a fertile, agriculturally productive place like
416880	421360	Tanzania, there is always a way to turn a profit off of any swath of open land, and
421360	423920	therefore it's always under threat.
423920	428800	In rural areas, agriculture is the driving force behind the destruction of wilderness.
428800	432800	Beyond just fields for farming, there's cattle grazing—letting livestock forage for their
432800	436960	food is cost-efficient compared to paying for feed, assuming the grazing land is cheap
436960	437840	enough.
437840	442960	Inherently, almost any stretch of land that can sustain wild animals can also sustain
442960	447440	cattle, and with virtually endless demand for beef, there's always incentive for farmers
447440	450400	to gobble up more land if the price is right.
451120	457760	So, nowadays, there is no such thing as valueless land, and correspondingly, there is no free
457760	458640	land.
458640	463440	The problem that presents for humans is that, uninhibited, essentially everything would
463440	468400	be turned into something, and any human use of land presents an issue for wild animals,
468400	472720	as even something as simple as cattle grazing leads to diminished resources and disrupted
472720	478400	ecosystems, which makes it tougher and tougher for already endangered wild animals to survive.
478400	481200	But animals don't interact with our economy.
481200	486400	Their habitats have tremendous existential value for them, just as ours do for us, but
486400	490640	they're competing against a system in which that value is not incorporated.
490640	495280	Therefore, when you distribute land through a capitalistic, supply-and-demand-driven model,
495280	499440	you have to work against that model to save these habitats.
499520	501200	That's the role of conservation.
501200	507440	You take land and specify its use as disuse, but conservation has a cost—not just to set
507440	510080	up, but perhaps more importantly, to enforce.
510640	516640	Serengeti National Park is massive—in fact, it's larger than the entire nation of Qatar.
516640	520800	Without enforcement, it'd be very easy for a farmer to bring their cattle in for illegal
520800	524800	grazing and go undetected, and that's hardly the biggest threat.
524800	530240	Many of the animals, directly due to their scarcity, are worth eye-popping amounts.
530240	536320	For example, a single rhino horn is estimated to sell for $100,000 to $300,000 on the black
536320	540400	market, where in countries like China and Vietnam, the crushed-up form of it is perceived
540400	542800	to be a powerful tool as a traditional medicine.
543360	548720	Back in Tanzania, with its average annual income of $1100, that's a truly life-changing
548720	553440	sum of money, so there's enormous incentive to illegally hunt and dehorn the animal.
553440	556880	While that's the most extreme example, there's also plenty of profit to be made
556880	561360	by killing elephants, lions, cheetahs, and other rare and endangered species in protected
561360	566240	areas like the Serengeti, so proper conservation requires effective spending on enforcement
566240	568400	across a huge swath of land.
568960	575280	So that's all to say, conservation in the 21st century can't be passive.
575280	581440	It has to be an active process, and therefore, it demands a very real, sometimes significant,
581440	581920	cost.
582560	588880	Tanzania, and essentially every major safari destination in Africa, is not a wealthy place.
588880	592960	The government does not have bounds of money to throw around, especially when their human
592960	598640	population faces myriad life-or-death issues that can be solved rather simply with government
598640	599140	spending.
599680	606240	So, trophy hunting works as a tragic, but possibly effective, bargain—giving animals
606240	612320	a means to generate economic value in our economic system in situations where, regrettably,
612320	615200	there are few practical alternatives.
615200	619760	There are a huge number of hunters around the world who are willing to pay $20,000 to
619760	626000	kill an elephant, and $20,000 can go a very, very long way in saving other elephants from
626000	628320	habitat destruction, poaching, and more.
628320	634000	The concept, therefore, is clear—kill one to save more than one.
634000	639920	From a pragmatic, utilitarian perspective, this is a worthy bargain.
639920	644000	And when you put it in a real-world context, the case is bolstered further.
644000	647680	Guiding hunting trips is an exceptionally good employment opportunity for those living
647680	652080	around conservation areas, and even offers a legitimate use for the skills a former poacher
652080	653200	might have acquired.
653200	657440	Trophy hunting can typically only happen on certain land with an approved guide, for which
657440	659440	hunters pay enormous sums.
659440	665680	A 21-day hunt in Tanzania typically costs $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 all in per person,
665680	669760	and then it costs more to get extra permits to kill more than what's included in that
669760	671280	government-regulated package.
671920	675920	It's also an exceptionally strong mechanism for generating conservation revenue in places
675920	679840	that might be too dangerous or undeveloped for a competitive photosafari industry.
679840	685200	For example, Mozambique has a healthy safari hunting industry, despite just a minor photosafari
685200	685920	one.
685920	687760	And then, there are the case studies.
687760	692400	South Africa has an oft-toted story of boosting its white rhino population from the dozens
692400	696960	to the thousand through trophy hunting, Zimbabwe used the industry to double its conservation
696960	701920	lands, and Tanzania itself insists that the industry is a critical factor in its abnormally
701920	703600	high lion population.
703600	708880	Theoretically, trophy hunting can, objectively, create more good than bad.
708880	712640	It can be a tragedy that minimizes tragedy.
712640	717200	It only takes a simple understanding of the system to understand that.
717280	719040	But does it balance out?
719760	724800	Well, like a frustrating many of things, it depends on who you ask.
724800	728400	In fact, one of the fiercest debates centers around the fact that one would think would
728400	732240	be the easiest to confirm—how much revenue trophy hunting creates.
732240	736800	For example, the Safari Club International, a US-based organization that, according to
736800	738480	its mission statement, seeks to quote,
738480	742480	"...protect the freedom to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation," boasts that trophy
742480	748480	hunting contributes $426 million annually to the GDP of these eight southern African
748480	749360	economies.
749360	753600	That number originates in a study they commissioned from Southwick Associates, a Florida-based
753600	758160	market research firm that, according to its own website, proudly supports pro-gun organizations
758160	761760	like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and also states that their quote,
761760	765600	"...economic impact analysis calculates the importance an activity or initiative has on
765600	770000	the economy or quality of life of a region, generating greater support for that activity."
770000	774320	And this study certainly generated that support, putting forward one of the highest economic
774320	777760	impact estimates of any purportedly legitimate study to date.
778480	783440	In response, the Humane Society International, which does not hide its position against trophy
783440	788400	hunting, commissioned its own study by Australia-based economists at large, which laid out numerous
788400	791200	methodological errors in the Southwick analysis.
791200	794880	The overall structure of the Southwick study involves surveying hunters on their in-country
794880	799040	spending, multiplying that by the total number of hunter-visitors, then adding a multiplier
799040	802080	to that to inflate it to a corresponding GDP figure.
802080	808480	From the very start, Southwick reached an eye-popping $20,602 estimate of in-country
808480	809680	spending per hunter.
809680	814640	While plenty of hunters pay for the most expensive elephant, lion, or cheetah permits, far more
814640	819040	engaged in shorter, cheaper hunts for less dangerous game, which in most other studies
819040	823280	has pulled the average down far below this $20,000 figure.
823280	828240	In fact, even their own data indicates a strong sampling bias, as they divided their survey
828240	829520	into three rounds.
829520	836240	The first two found an average of about $16,000 in spend, then the third reached $25,600 — a
836240	840720	60% inflation, which properly sampled studies should not see.
840720	845600	And perhaps more fundamentally, the Southwick study considered trophy hunting entirely in
845600	850320	isolation, assuming that exactly zero income would occur from the land, businesses, and
850320	853520	visitors engaging in the industry if it didn't occur.
853520	858800	That is clearly false, and such a basic failure in the process of economic impact analysis
858800	862160	that it's covered in the second paragraph of its Wikipedia page.
862160	866080	That would be like arguing that you've created economic benefit by selling scrap metal, even
866080	868880	when it came from demolishing a perfectly good building.
868880	873200	Southwick itself admitted that 11% of its surveyed hunters would still have traveled
873200	877200	to the destination country if not for trophy hunting, and yet they attribute all of the
877200	882160	revenue these brought to trophy hunting, even when much of it would have happened otherwise.
882160	888000	Again, they've completely ignored the counterfactual case because it was convenient to their client.
888000	892240	The study also found that only about 5% of total in-country spending was attributable
892240	897280	to non-hunting related activities, which is far lower than the 30 or 40% found in previous
897280	901600	studies, and then with this already deflated amount, they still attributed that spending
901600	904480	to hunting itself, further boosting the figures.
904480	909760	Issues like this mount and mount, so economists at large revised and corrected the methodology
909840	916960	to create their own economic impact estimate—$132 million, less than a third of what Southwick
916960	917680	posited.
917680	921600	While other studies seem to converge on a number more in the 200s, the point is less
921600	926800	about a systematic over- or under-exaggeration, but more so about the inherent inability to
926800	932160	actually reach any confident consensus on the economic effect of trophy hunting on GDP.
932160	936640	But trophy hunting is not even supposed to be about GDP growth—it's not supposed to
936640	939200	be a system designed for economic growth.
939200	943760	That can be a nice side effect, but the bargain is about sacrificing the few for the many
943760	945840	on behalf of the animals.
945840	949440	Establishing a figure of how much revenue actually ends up used for conservation has
949440	954960	proven even tougher, and concerningly, even Southwick suggested that only some $27 to
954960	959920	$40 million of their purported $426 million went to conservation.
959920	966240	That means that a $7,000 line in Tanzania has unwillingly sacrificed at least $6,300
966240	970560	of itself for humans and only $700 for its brethren.
970560	975200	At the simplest, least academic level, the systematic slaughter of a species of only
975200	981680	20,000 globally for only $700 in benefit to that species is a much tougher bargain to
981680	982240	argue for.
982960	988000	There is a world in which trophy hunting works, but when you dig into it, it's increasingly
988000	990240	difficult to believe it's this one.
990240	994880	It's a theoretically viable concept that has crashed head-on into the dirty, difficult
994880	1000320	realities of a flawed world, and that increasingly operates as a profit-generation device rather
1000320	1002320	than a pragmatic bargain.
1002320	1006960	So, when coming back down to the less destructive bargain, photosafaris, it's clear that it's
1006960	1011120	less useful to look at it from the basis of its theoretical underpinnings, and more so
1011120	1013200	its real-world realities.
1013760	1018720	In Tanzania, photosafaris and their rising popularity through the lens of conservation
1018720	1021360	are becoming increasingly problematic.
1021360	1025520	In the past two decades, the annual number of international tourists in Tanzania has
1025520	1029600	tripled, while the country's total tourism receipts have surpassed that of Kenya, their
1029600	1032240	northern neighbor with a more mature tourism sector.
1032240	1035920	That means more people than ever are spending more than ever to visit.
1035920	1041280	This increased allure has set off a land race and development boom across northern Tanzania.
1041280	1045200	Luxury resorts like the Four Seasons aren't confined to Serengeti National Park, but are
1045200	1047280	instead spread across the area.
1047280	1051680	This network of tour companies, roads, airstrips, national parks, and conservation areas from
1051680	1056400	Mount Kilimanjaro to the Serengeti is now so well established that it has its own name—the
1056400	1057600	Northern Circuit.
1057600	1061840	The rise of the Northern Circuit has made it clear that in Tanzania, tourism doesn't
1061840	1066080	serve conservation, but rather, conservation serves tourism.
1066080	1070400	Within Tanzania's park system, further and further development seem an opportunity they're
1070400	1074720	trying hard to capitalize on, as each year they release an annual investment prospectus
1074720	1079200	for those who might be entertaining the idea of building a lodge within the park's boundaries.
1079200	1083840	The parks are undeniably changing, but this new age scramble for Africa is being most
1083840	1088160	acutely felt in the lands directly around the parks, where wildlife still roams, but
1088160	1092000	regulations are more relaxed and restrictions remain relatively loose.
1092000	1095920	Some companies, like Dorobo Safaris, have entered mutually beneficial agreements to
1095920	1099920	lease from and work with the local Maasai people to establish wildlife-watching services
1099920	1101040	outside of the park.
1101040	1104560	Others have opted instead to work with the Tanzanian government directly to establish
1104560	1106160	safari or hunting reserves.
1106160	1110480	The UAE-owned Oterlo Business Corporation, for instance, relied on close connections
1110480	1114800	to the Tanzanian government to create a hunting resort here, and government forced to relocate
1114800	1116800	locals once they began to expand.
1116800	1122000	Regardless of how they go about it, and regardless of their reputations, developers and outfitters
1122000	1126880	are riding the region's newfound notoriety, putting pressure on locals, and forever altering
1126880	1131200	the very landscapes driving the region's rise in popularity.
1131200	1135840	For the sake of pure conservation, tourism's proving too successful.
1135840	1140320	It's leading to more roads, more airstrips, more suspect private entities running hunting
1140320	1142000	reserves and safari lodges.
1142000	1146000	It's leading to strife between local populations and Tanzania's federal government that it
1146000	1148640	has the potential to destabilize the region.
1148640	1153200	The downstream effect of this land rush is a landscape marred by shining new resorts,
1153200	1157600	freshly cut roadways, and burned down villages monitored by officials stretched too thin,
1157600	1161040	and supervised by a federal government with a spotty record.
1161040	1165920	Northern Tanzania is quickly becoming a landscape where the rules of conservation take a backseat
1165920	1170800	to the economic potential that Africa's brilliant biodiversity affords.
1170800	1176240	Moral bargains can seem effective when discussed theoretically, but then you go from concept
1176240	1177280	to reality.
1177280	1183680	For decades upon decades, Serengeti National Park has conserved its land, so simply, it's
1183680	1189040	tough to recognize how this recent buildup, this ruination, has equivalently worked to
1189040	1191200	further that conservation mission.
1191200	1195840	And this seems to be a moment that most moral bargains reach, when the side effect, the
1195840	1201440	bonus revenue-seeking justification that enables the bargain, becomes a disconnected, profit-seeking
1201440	1202160	motive.
1202160	1208000	This happens slowly, quietly, and then suddenly, one takes a look back, and a theoretical good
1208000	1210880	has taken an entirely different form.
1210880	1216640	Therefore, any bargain is only as effective as those maintaining and enforcing the bargain.
1216640	1218240	Safaris are no different.
1218240	1222080	There's no slam dunk, there's no this is bad and this is good.
1222080	1228000	It's rather a reminder of the value of nuance, a reminder that this, like any bargain, is
1228000	1232400	defined by the boring, quiet, unglamorous task of enforcing it.
1233600	1235680	Scarcity drives value.
1235680	1240000	That's almost universally true, and it's certainly the case with domain names.
1240000	1243920	There can only be one instance of a given domain, and so especially when that domain
1243920	1247520	uniquely matters to you, it's hugely valuable to you.
1247520	1252240	For example, you might want to own yourlastname.com, but once it's gone, it's gone, and if you
1252240	1256240	ever really, really want it, you'd probably have to pay a domain squatter a huge fee to
1256240	1259280	get it—unless you just get it now.
1259280	1262800	That's always been my approach with domains, so whenever I land on a name for a new channel,
1262800	1267360	for example, even if it's still just a concept, I head to our sponsor, Hover, to buy it now,
1267360	1268400	before it's gone.
1268400	1272480	The reason I've always used Hover is because I know they have fair, transparent pricing,
1272480	1275840	a super quick and easy purchase process, and if there's ever the need, they truly
1275840	1279360	have some of the best customer support of any business I've used.
1279360	1283600	They also allow you to get creative with your domain, with over 400 domain extensions that
1283600	1286560	allow you to land on something like our Wendover.productions domain.
1286560	1290880	People are always blown away that that's actually our domain, without any .com or .org,
1290880	1293040	and the way I found that was with Hover.
1293040	1297280	We also use them for our company email addresses, since you can set up a custom, professional-looking
1297280	1301120	email address at your custom domain truly in seconds, which means that when we reach
1301120	1304080	out to people, they know it's from us and not some scammer.
1304080	1308480	All around, Hover just gets the domain purchasing and management process right, and it's the
1308480	1312240	kind of thing that you want to make sure you get right, so click the button on screen or
1312240	1316960	head to hover.com slash wendover to get 10% off your first purchase, and thanks in advance,
1316960	1319520	since you'll be supporting Wendover while you're at it.
