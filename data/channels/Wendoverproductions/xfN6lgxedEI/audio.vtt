00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
This is one of the most opulent airports in the world—Sarinara Airstrip.

00:05.200 --> 00:10.560
It's composed of one small, unimpressive terminal, a 7,000-foot dirt runway, and yet

00:10.560 --> 00:14.720
it sees dozens of flights per day and an average net worth of those traveling through it higher

00:14.720 --> 00:17.080
than almost any other in the world.

00:17.080 --> 00:22.800
That's because this tiny airstrip is the gateway to the massive Serengeti National

00:22.800 --> 00:28.560
Park—a safari destination so storied, so legendary, that it's one of only a handful

00:28.640 --> 00:32.000
globally that the average person might recognize by name.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.040
For the fanciest few, their touchdown is met with a heavily modified Toyota Land Cruiser,

00:37.040 --> 00:41.520
quickly whisking them away, across the savanna, to the four-season Safari Lodge,

00:41.520 --> 00:45.680
one of the most expensive outposts of one of the most expensive hotel chains.

00:45.680 --> 00:51.520
Rooms demand a minimum of $1,100 a night, and minimum is the key word there.

00:51.520 --> 00:56.640
In peak season, during the Great Migration, the same rooms will near $3,000, and the most

00:56.640 --> 01:02.000
expensive, the three-bedroom Presidential Villa, demands over $10,000 per night.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.640
With a pool, spa, gym, multiple bars and restaurants, and plenty of optional activities

01:06.640 --> 01:10.480
for an upcharge, the lodge has everything you'd expect from a hotel of its caliber,

01:10.480 --> 01:16.800
but perhaps not a hotel here—hours away from anywhere, surrounded on all sides by

01:16.800 --> 01:18.960
seemingly endless savanna.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.480
But zoom out just ever so slightly more, and it becomes clear that the four-season Serengeti

01:24.480 --> 01:26.080
is hardly alone.

01:26.080 --> 01:30.160
The National Park is home to over a dozen five-star hotels, some of which best even

01:30.160 --> 01:31.920
the four seasons' prices.

01:31.920 --> 01:36.640
Camps like the one-nature hotel Nyar Zuiga, for example, sell a night in their most affordable

01:36.640 --> 01:38.960
luxury tents for at least $3,000.

01:40.080 --> 01:45.040
Serengeti National Park has developed into the destination for luxury Safaris, and so

01:45.040 --> 01:50.160
the remote stretch of savanna has become a bizarrely busy hotspot for the world rich

01:50.160 --> 01:50.720
and famous.

01:51.520 --> 01:57.120
And yet, zoom out once again, and it all starts to seem even more ludicrous.

01:57.680 --> 02:03.440
The Serengeti is located in Tanzania, a sub-Saharan African country that, according to World Bank

02:03.440 --> 02:08.480
estimates, is the 30th poorest in the world on a GDP per capita basis.

02:08.480 --> 02:15.360
Average income is $1,099 per year, almost exactly equal to the cheapest night in the

02:15.360 --> 02:17.680
cheapest room at that four seasons.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.560
The region that encompasses it, Mara, is even poorer than that national average, despite

02:22.560 --> 02:26.640
tourism's boost, so for its residents, if they were to take a quick trip into the park

02:26.640 --> 02:30.720
and up to the lodge, a salad at the restaurant would equate to four and a half days of income,

02:30.720 --> 02:35.280
a chicken sandwich about six, and a main course would demand some eight days of labor.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.000
This degree of difference just feels wrong.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.720
There's something about such a stark degree of income inequality in such a close proximity

02:44.720 --> 02:47.520
that conjures up concerns of exploitation.

02:47.520 --> 02:52.160
But beyond the emotions of it, beyond the near primal instincts of perceiving rich people

02:52.160 --> 02:54.720
in poor places as wrong, is it?

02:55.600 --> 03:01.520
Well, you probably already intuitively know the broad upsides and downsides.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.840
For example, many who live in this remote region are now able to earn a living serving

03:05.840 --> 03:10.560
as guides for the ultra-wealthy, touring their ancestral home-turned-pristine, unpopulated

03:10.560 --> 03:11.600
wilderness.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.440
Of course, that brings up the fact that they were kicked off the land in the first place,

03:15.440 --> 03:19.600
but a land without people, on the other hand, is of a measurable benefit to the animals,

03:19.600 --> 03:23.520
and for their part, while the animals largely go free, they still have the occasional safari

03:23.520 --> 03:24.960
party to navigate.

03:24.960 --> 03:28.800
Human presence stresses elephants, getting too near feeding cheetah leads to the skittish

03:28.800 --> 03:32.960
cat abandoning the kill, and normalizing the presence of humans doesn't serve any animal's

03:32.960 --> 03:36.320
best interest once it inadvertently wanders into a hunting preserve.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.320
But ultimately, human presence is what drives the revenue that makes the park possible to

03:40.320 --> 03:40.960
begin with.

03:40.960 --> 03:44.320
And then the side effect this creates is the country's tourism industry, which relies

03:44.320 --> 03:46.240
on the park to bring customers in.

03:46.240 --> 03:49.280
In this system, there are undeniable trade-offs.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.200
People are kicked off their land, animals are poked, prodded, and tamed for tourists,

03:53.200 --> 03:57.280
and the seized areas are quietly developed into nature theme parks managed by governments

03:57.280 --> 03:59.120
with spotty track records.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.960
But this is what the rest of the world relies on to protect dwindling species and shrinking

04:02.960 --> 04:05.360
natural wonders only left in Africa.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.800
It's certainly a compromise.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.680
In fact, it's outright unfair to some.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.160
And while it's easy to recognize the moral trade-off that undergirds photo-safaris, it's

04:16.160 --> 04:20.320
tough to critically examine because, when brought down to the individual level, it's

04:20.320 --> 04:23.840
such a small downside for such a small upside.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.480
No single person is making a meaningful difference, positive or negative.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.400
It's the phenomenon that does.

04:31.040 --> 04:37.200
So, perhaps it's more useful to examine this trade-off in starker form—a near-equivalent

04:37.200 --> 04:43.440
where individuals make the same moral trade-off, but with an enormous life-or-death difference.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.120
Safari Hunting

04:46.000 --> 04:51.120
You can legally kill almost any animal in Africa—for a price.

04:51.680 --> 04:57.360
Zebras, giraffes, buffaloes, hippos, cheetahs, lions, elephants, and even the critically

04:57.360 --> 05:04.640
endangered white rhino, of which only 6,000 exist, upon purchase of a $350,000 permit.

05:04.640 --> 05:09.760
Tanzania, one of the top trophy hunting destinations, regulates and publishes a remarkably

05:09.760 --> 05:13.120
specific price list for buying the right to kill its wildlife.

05:13.120 --> 05:19.600
The ever-present otter only costs some $170, the abundant yet enormous hippo goes for $1,500,

05:19.600 --> 05:22.480
and then you get into the rare species.

05:22.480 --> 05:29.040
Leopards fetch a $4,500 fee, lions some $7,000, and the top price in Tanzania is bestowed

05:29.040 --> 05:34.000
to the elephant, an endangered species known for its highly valuable ivory tusks, which

05:34.000 --> 05:39.200
justifies the $20,000 trophy hunting fee to bag those with the largest tusks.

05:39.760 --> 05:44.880
Such commodification of the world's rarest and most beloved species draws up immense

05:44.880 --> 05:48.640
emotion—it feels like a failure of humanity.

05:48.640 --> 05:53.280
Historically, humans hunted these species into near-nonexistence, then they stole their

05:53.280 --> 05:57.920
habitats to turn them into farms and fields and cities, and then after all that, after

05:57.920 --> 06:02.000
facing the precipice of extinction, they put a price on their lives.

06:02.640 --> 06:07.600
Their protectors, the authorities in charge of keeping them safe in a world that structurally

06:07.600 --> 06:12.480
imperils them, have signed up on their deaths, all to have them skinned, stretched onto a

06:12.480 --> 06:16.640
mannequin, then mounted above a Texan's fireplace to serve as a talking point at dinner

06:16.640 --> 06:20.800
parties, kicking off the conversation about the time they went on safari in the Serengeti.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.760
It feels tragic.

06:24.640 --> 06:30.480
However, in certain circumstances, tragedy can minimize tragedy.

06:31.040 --> 06:36.560
You see, as unfortunate as it may be, pure conservation can't exist today.

06:37.120 --> 06:42.640
Animals in Africa, or anywhere, cannot live as they did in centuries past, because the

06:42.640 --> 06:47.280
human population has exploded and spread to every corner of the globe.

06:47.280 --> 06:52.800
Excluding the most barren, dry, inhospitable reaches, essentially any land has value in

06:52.800 --> 06:56.880
the human economic system—certainly in a fertile, agriculturally productive place like

06:56.880 --> 07:01.360
Tanzania, there is always a way to turn a profit off of any swath of open land, and

07:01.360 --> 07:03.920
therefore it's always under threat.

07:03.920 --> 07:08.800
In rural areas, agriculture is the driving force behind the destruction of wilderness.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.800
Beyond just fields for farming, there's cattle grazing—letting livestock forage for their

07:12.800 --> 07:16.960
food is cost-efficient compared to paying for feed, assuming the grazing land is cheap

07:16.960 --> 07:17.840
enough.

07:17.840 --> 07:22.960
Inherently, almost any stretch of land that can sustain wild animals can also sustain

07:22.960 --> 07:27.440
cattle, and with virtually endless demand for beef, there's always incentive for farmers

07:27.440 --> 07:30.400
to gobble up more land if the price is right.

07:31.120 --> 07:37.760
So, nowadays, there is no such thing as valueless land, and correspondingly, there is no free

07:37.760 --> 07:38.640
land.

07:38.640 --> 07:43.440
The problem that presents for humans is that, uninhibited, essentially everything would

07:43.440 --> 07:48.400
be turned into something, and any human use of land presents an issue for wild animals,

07:48.400 --> 07:52.720
as even something as simple as cattle grazing leads to diminished resources and disrupted

07:52.720 --> 07:58.400
ecosystems, which makes it tougher and tougher for already endangered wild animals to survive.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.200
But animals don't interact with our economy.

08:01.200 --> 08:06.400
Their habitats have tremendous existential value for them, just as ours do for us, but

08:06.400 --> 08:10.640
they're competing against a system in which that value is not incorporated.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.280
Therefore, when you distribute land through a capitalistic, supply-and-demand-driven model,

08:15.280 --> 08:19.440
you have to work against that model to save these habitats.

08:19.520 --> 08:21.200
That's the role of conservation.

08:21.200 --> 08:27.440
You take land and specify its use as disuse, but conservation has a cost—not just to set

08:27.440 --> 08:30.080
up, but perhaps more importantly, to enforce.

08:30.640 --> 08:36.640
Serengeti National Park is massive—in fact, it's larger than the entire nation of Qatar.

08:36.640 --> 08:40.800
Without enforcement, it'd be very easy for a farmer to bring their cattle in for illegal

08:40.800 --> 08:44.800
grazing and go undetected, and that's hardly the biggest threat.

08:44.800 --> 08:50.240
Many of the animals, directly due to their scarcity, are worth eye-popping amounts.

08:50.240 --> 08:56.320
For example, a single rhino horn is estimated to sell for $100,000 to $300,000 on the black

08:56.320 --> 09:00.400
market, where in countries like China and Vietnam, the crushed-up form of it is perceived

09:00.400 --> 09:02.800
to be a powerful tool as a traditional medicine.

09:03.360 --> 09:08.720
Back in Tanzania, with its average annual income of $1100, that's a truly life-changing

09:08.720 --> 09:13.440
sum of money, so there's enormous incentive to illegally hunt and dehorn the animal.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.880
While that's the most extreme example, there's also plenty of profit to be made

09:16.880 --> 09:21.360
by killing elephants, lions, cheetahs, and other rare and endangered species in protected

09:21.360 --> 09:26.240
areas like the Serengeti, so proper conservation requires effective spending on enforcement

09:26.240 --> 09:28.400
across a huge swath of land.

09:28.960 --> 09:35.280
So that's all to say, conservation in the 21st century can't be passive.

09:35.280 --> 09:41.440
It has to be an active process, and therefore, it demands a very real, sometimes significant,

09:41.440 --> 09:41.920
cost.

09:42.560 --> 09:48.880
Tanzania, and essentially every major safari destination in Africa, is not a wealthy place.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.960
The government does not have bounds of money to throw around, especially when their human

09:52.960 --> 09:58.640
population faces myriad life-or-death issues that can be solved rather simply with government

09:58.640 --> 09:59.140
spending.

09:59.680 --> 10:06.240
So, trophy hunting works as a tragic, but possibly effective, bargain—giving animals

10:06.240 --> 10:12.320
a means to generate economic value in our economic system in situations where, regrettably,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.200
there are few practical alternatives.

10:15.200 --> 10:19.760
There are a huge number of hunters around the world who are willing to pay $20,000 to

10:19.760 --> 10:26.000
kill an elephant, and $20,000 can go a very, very long way in saving other elephants from

10:26.000 --> 10:28.320
habitat destruction, poaching, and more.

10:28.320 --> 10:34.000
The concept, therefore, is clear—kill one to save more than one.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.920
From a pragmatic, utilitarian perspective, this is a worthy bargain.

10:39.920 --> 10:44.000
And when you put it in a real-world context, the case is bolstered further.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.680
Guiding hunting trips is an exceptionally good employment opportunity for those living

10:47.680 --> 10:52.080
around conservation areas, and even offers a legitimate use for the skills a former poacher

10:52.080 --> 10:53.200
might have acquired.

10:53.200 --> 10:57.440
Trophy hunting can typically only happen on certain land with an approved guide, for which

10:57.440 --> 10:59.440
hunters pay enormous sums.

10:59.440 --> 11:05.680
A 21-day hunt in Tanzania typically costs $40,000, $50,000, or $60,000 all in per person,

11:05.680 --> 11:09.760
and then it costs more to get extra permits to kill more than what's included in that

11:09.760 --> 11:11.280
government-regulated package.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.920
It's also an exceptionally strong mechanism for generating conservation revenue in places

11:15.920 --> 11:19.840
that might be too dangerous or undeveloped for a competitive photosafari industry.

11:19.840 --> 11:25.200
For example, Mozambique has a healthy safari hunting industry, despite just a minor photosafari

11:25.200 --> 11:25.920
one.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.760
And then, there are the case studies.

11:27.760 --> 11:32.400
South Africa has an oft-toted story of boosting its white rhino population from the dozens

11:32.400 --> 11:36.960
to the thousand through trophy hunting, Zimbabwe used the industry to double its conservation

11:36.960 --> 11:41.920
lands, and Tanzania itself insists that the industry is a critical factor in its abnormally

11:41.920 --> 11:43.600
high lion population.

11:43.600 --> 11:48.880
Theoretically, trophy hunting can, objectively, create more good than bad.

11:48.880 --> 11:52.640
It can be a tragedy that minimizes tragedy.

11:52.640 --> 11:57.200
It only takes a simple understanding of the system to understand that.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.040
But does it balance out?

11:59.760 --> 12:04.800
Well, like a frustrating many of things, it depends on who you ask.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.400
In fact, one of the fiercest debates centers around the fact that one would think would

12:08.400 --> 12:12.240
be the easiest to confirm—how much revenue trophy hunting creates.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.800
For example, the Safari Club International, a US-based organization that, according to

12:16.800 --> 12:18.480
its mission statement, seeks to quote,

12:18.480 --> 12:22.480
"...protect the freedom to hunt and to promote wildlife conservation," boasts that trophy

12:22.480 --> 12:28.480
hunting contributes $426 million annually to the GDP of these eight southern African

12:28.480 --> 12:29.360
economies.

12:29.360 --> 12:33.600
That number originates in a study they commissioned from Southwick Associates, a Florida-based

12:33.600 --> 12:38.160
market research firm that, according to its own website, proudly supports pro-gun organizations

12:38.160 --> 12:41.760
like the National Shooting Sports Foundation, and also states that their quote,

12:41.760 --> 12:45.600
"...economic impact analysis calculates the importance an activity or initiative has on

12:45.600 --> 12:50.000
the economy or quality of life of a region, generating greater support for that activity."

12:50.000 --> 12:54.320
And this study certainly generated that support, putting forward one of the highest economic

12:54.320 --> 12:57.760
impact estimates of any purportedly legitimate study to date.

12:58.480 --> 13:03.440
In response, the Humane Society International, which does not hide its position against trophy

13:03.440 --> 13:08.400
hunting, commissioned its own study by Australia-based economists at large, which laid out numerous

13:08.400 --> 13:11.200
methodological errors in the Southwick analysis.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.880
The overall structure of the Southwick study involves surveying hunters on their in-country

13:14.880 --> 13:19.040
spending, multiplying that by the total number of hunter-visitors, then adding a multiplier

13:19.040 --> 13:22.080
to that to inflate it to a corresponding GDP figure.

13:22.080 --> 13:28.480
From the very start, Southwick reached an eye-popping $20,602 estimate of in-country

13:28.480 --> 13:29.680
spending per hunter.

13:29.680 --> 13:34.640
While plenty of hunters pay for the most expensive elephant, lion, or cheetah permits, far more

13:34.640 --> 13:39.040
engaged in shorter, cheaper hunts for less dangerous game, which in most other studies

13:39.040 --> 13:43.280
has pulled the average down far below this $20,000 figure.

13:43.280 --> 13:48.240
In fact, even their own data indicates a strong sampling bias, as they divided their survey

13:48.240 --> 13:49.520
into three rounds.

13:49.520 --> 13:56.240
The first two found an average of about $16,000 in spend, then the third reached $25,600 — a

13:56.240 --> 14:00.720
60% inflation, which properly sampled studies should not see.

14:00.720 --> 14:05.600
And perhaps more fundamentally, the Southwick study considered trophy hunting entirely in

14:05.600 --> 14:10.320
isolation, assuming that exactly zero income would occur from the land, businesses, and

14:10.320 --> 14:13.520
visitors engaging in the industry if it didn't occur.

14:13.520 --> 14:18.800
That is clearly false, and such a basic failure in the process of economic impact analysis

14:18.800 --> 14:22.160
that it's covered in the second paragraph of its Wikipedia page.

14:22.160 --> 14:26.080
That would be like arguing that you've created economic benefit by selling scrap metal, even

14:26.080 --> 14:28.880
when it came from demolishing a perfectly good building.

14:28.880 --> 14:33.200
Southwick itself admitted that 11% of its surveyed hunters would still have traveled

14:33.200 --> 14:37.200
to the destination country if not for trophy hunting, and yet they attribute all of the

14:37.200 --> 14:42.160
revenue these brought to trophy hunting, even when much of it would have happened otherwise.

14:42.160 --> 14:48.000
Again, they've completely ignored the counterfactual case because it was convenient to their client.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.240
The study also found that only about 5% of total in-country spending was attributable

14:52.240 --> 14:57.280
to non-hunting related activities, which is far lower than the 30 or 40% found in previous

14:57.280 --> 15:01.600
studies, and then with this already deflated amount, they still attributed that spending

15:01.600 --> 15:04.480
to hunting itself, further boosting the figures.

15:04.480 --> 15:09.760
Issues like this mount and mount, so economists at large revised and corrected the methodology

15:09.840 --> 15:16.960
to create their own economic impact estimate—$132 million, less than a third of what Southwick

15:16.960 --> 15:17.680
posited.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.600
While other studies seem to converge on a number more in the 200s, the point is less

15:21.600 --> 15:26.800
about a systematic over- or under-exaggeration, but more so about the inherent inability to

15:26.800 --> 15:32.160
actually reach any confident consensus on the economic effect of trophy hunting on GDP.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.640
But trophy hunting is not even supposed to be about GDP growth—it's not supposed to

15:36.640 --> 15:39.200
be a system designed for economic growth.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.760
That can be a nice side effect, but the bargain is about sacrificing the few for the many

15:43.760 --> 15:45.840
on behalf of the animals.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.440
Establishing a figure of how much revenue actually ends up used for conservation has

15:49.440 --> 15:54.960
proven even tougher, and concerningly, even Southwick suggested that only some $27 to

15:54.960 --> 15:59.920
$40 million of their purported $426 million went to conservation.

15:59.920 --> 16:06.240
That means that a $7,000 line in Tanzania has unwillingly sacrificed at least $6,300

16:06.240 --> 16:10.560
of itself for humans and only $700 for its brethren.

16:10.560 --> 16:15.200
At the simplest, least academic level, the systematic slaughter of a species of only

16:15.200 --> 16:21.680
20,000 globally for only $700 in benefit to that species is a much tougher bargain to

16:21.680 --> 16:22.240
argue for.

16:22.960 --> 16:28.000
There is a world in which trophy hunting works, but when you dig into it, it's increasingly

16:28.000 --> 16:30.240
difficult to believe it's this one.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.880
It's a theoretically viable concept that has crashed head-on into the dirty, difficult

16:34.880 --> 16:40.320
realities of a flawed world, and that increasingly operates as a profit-generation device rather

16:40.320 --> 16:42.320
than a pragmatic bargain.

16:42.320 --> 16:46.960
So, when coming back down to the less destructive bargain, photosafaris, it's clear that it's

16:46.960 --> 16:51.120
less useful to look at it from the basis of its theoretical underpinnings, and more so

16:51.120 --> 16:53.200
its real-world realities.

16:53.760 --> 16:58.720
In Tanzania, photosafaris and their rising popularity through the lens of conservation

16:58.720 --> 17:01.360
are becoming increasingly problematic.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.520
In the past two decades, the annual number of international tourists in Tanzania has

17:05.520 --> 17:09.600
tripled, while the country's total tourism receipts have surpassed that of Kenya, their

17:09.600 --> 17:12.240
northern neighbor with a more mature tourism sector.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.920
That means more people than ever are spending more than ever to visit.

17:15.920 --> 17:21.280
This increased allure has set off a land race and development boom across northern Tanzania.

17:21.280 --> 17:25.200
Luxury resorts like the Four Seasons aren't confined to Serengeti National Park, but are

17:25.200 --> 17:27.280
instead spread across the area.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.680
This network of tour companies, roads, airstrips, national parks, and conservation areas from

17:31.680 --> 17:36.400
Mount Kilimanjaro to the Serengeti is now so well established that it has its own name—the

17:36.400 --> 17:37.600
Northern Circuit.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.840
The rise of the Northern Circuit has made it clear that in Tanzania, tourism doesn't

17:41.840 --> 17:46.080
serve conservation, but rather, conservation serves tourism.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.400
Within Tanzania's park system, further and further development seem an opportunity they're

17:50.400 --> 17:54.720
trying hard to capitalize on, as each year they release an annual investment prospectus

17:54.720 --> 17:59.200
for those who might be entertaining the idea of building a lodge within the park's boundaries.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.840
The parks are undeniably changing, but this new age scramble for Africa is being most

18:03.840 --> 18:08.160
acutely felt in the lands directly around the parks, where wildlife still roams, but

18:08.160 --> 18:12.000
regulations are more relaxed and restrictions remain relatively loose.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.920
Some companies, like Dorobo Safaris, have entered mutually beneficial agreements to

18:15.920 --> 18:19.920
lease from and work with the local Maasai people to establish wildlife-watching services

18:19.920 --> 18:21.040
outside of the park.

18:21.040 --> 18:24.560
Others have opted instead to work with the Tanzanian government directly to establish

18:24.560 --> 18:26.160
safari or hunting reserves.

18:26.160 --> 18:30.480
The UAE-owned Oterlo Business Corporation, for instance, relied on close connections

18:30.480 --> 18:34.800
to the Tanzanian government to create a hunting resort here, and government forced to relocate

18:34.800 --> 18:36.800
locals once they began to expand.

18:36.800 --> 18:42.000
Regardless of how they go about it, and regardless of their reputations, developers and outfitters

18:42.000 --> 18:46.880
are riding the region's newfound notoriety, putting pressure on locals, and forever altering

18:46.880 --> 18:51.200
the very landscapes driving the region's rise in popularity.

18:51.200 --> 18:55.840
For the sake of pure conservation, tourism's proving too successful.

18:55.840 --> 19:00.320
It's leading to more roads, more airstrips, more suspect private entities running hunting

19:00.320 --> 19:02.000
reserves and safari lodges.

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
It's leading to strife between local populations and Tanzania's federal government that it

19:06.000 --> 19:08.640
has the potential to destabilize the region.

19:08.640 --> 19:13.200
The downstream effect of this land rush is a landscape marred by shining new resorts,

19:13.200 --> 19:17.600
freshly cut roadways, and burned down villages monitored by officials stretched too thin,

19:17.600 --> 19:21.040
and supervised by a federal government with a spotty record.

19:21.040 --> 19:25.920
Northern Tanzania is quickly becoming a landscape where the rules of conservation take a backseat

19:25.920 --> 19:30.800
to the economic potential that Africa's brilliant biodiversity affords.

19:30.800 --> 19:36.240
Moral bargains can seem effective when discussed theoretically, but then you go from concept

19:36.240 --> 19:37.280
to reality.

19:37.280 --> 19:43.680
For decades upon decades, Serengeti National Park has conserved its land, so simply, it's

19:43.680 --> 19:49.040
tough to recognize how this recent buildup, this ruination, has equivalently worked to

19:49.040 --> 19:51.200
further that conservation mission.

19:51.200 --> 19:55.840
And this seems to be a moment that most moral bargains reach, when the side effect, the

19:55.840 --> 20:01.440
bonus revenue-seeking justification that enables the bargain, becomes a disconnected, profit-seeking

20:01.440 --> 20:02.160
motive.

20:02.160 --> 20:08.000
This happens slowly, quietly, and then suddenly, one takes a look back, and a theoretical good

20:08.000 --> 20:10.880
has taken an entirely different form.

20:10.880 --> 20:16.640
Therefore, any bargain is only as effective as those maintaining and enforcing the bargain.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.240
Safaris are no different.

20:18.240 --> 20:22.080
There's no slam dunk, there's no this is bad and this is good.

20:22.080 --> 20:28.000
It's rather a reminder of the value of nuance, a reminder that this, like any bargain, is

20:28.000 --> 20:32.400
defined by the boring, quiet, unglamorous task of enforcing it.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.680
Scarcity drives value.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.000
That's almost universally true, and it's certainly the case with domain names.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.920
There can only be one instance of a given domain, and so especially when that domain

20:43.920 --> 20:47.520
uniquely matters to you, it's hugely valuable to you.

20:47.520 --> 20:52.240
For example, you might want to own yourlastname.com, but once it's gone, it's gone, and if you

20:52.240 --> 20:56.240
ever really, really want it, you'd probably have to pay a domain squatter a huge fee to

20:56.240 --> 20:59.280
get it—unless you just get it now.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.800
That's always been my approach with domains, so whenever I land on a name for a new channel,

21:02.800 --> 21:07.360
for example, even if it's still just a concept, I head to our sponsor, Hover, to buy it now,

21:07.360 --> 21:08.400
before it's gone.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.480
The reason I've always used Hover is because I know they have fair, transparent pricing,

21:12.480 --> 21:15.840
a super quick and easy purchase process, and if there's ever the need, they truly

21:15.840 --> 21:19.360
have some of the best customer support of any business I've used.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.600
They also allow you to get creative with your domain, with over 400 domain extensions that

21:23.600 --> 21:26.560
allow you to land on something like our Wendover.productions domain.

21:26.560 --> 21:30.880
People are always blown away that that's actually our domain, without any .com or .org,

21:30.880 --> 21:33.040
and the way I found that was with Hover.

21:33.040 --> 21:37.280
We also use them for our company email addresses, since you can set up a custom, professional-looking

21:37.280 --> 21:41.120
email address at your custom domain truly in seconds, which means that when we reach

21:41.120 --> 21:44.080
out to people, they know it's from us and not some scammer.

21:44.080 --> 21:48.480
All around, Hover just gets the domain purchasing and management process right, and it's the

21:48.480 --> 21:52.240
kind of thing that you want to make sure you get right, so click the button on screen or

21:52.240 --> 21:56.960
head to hover.com slash wendover to get 10% off your first purchase, and thanks in advance,

21:56.960 --> 21:59.520
since you'll be supporting Wendover while you're at it.
