00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,840
When you think of freight transport, the image in your head might include massive container

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,540
ships or mile-long trains or enormous cargo planes, but more than each of those, the transportation

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,940
method that carries the vast majority of the world's freight is trucks.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,540
In most places, it's not even close.

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,500
By value, they carry 73% of the US's domestic freight.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,060
It is truly trucks that connect to the world more than anything else.

9
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:43,380
Trucking fills a lot of roles from just daily deliveries to urban households all the way

10
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,720
to cross-country treks bringing goods from manufacturer to consumer.

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,100
It is that form, though—long-haul, over-the-road trucking—that is most elusive.

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,420
These trucks are visible on the highways of any country, but the infrastructure supporting

13
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,620
this transportation system hides in plain sight.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,300
When on the road, long-haul truckers live and work in their trucks.

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,940
Of course their job is centered around sitting behind the wheel, but the section behind that

16
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,780
is where they live.

17
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,500
Drivers are only allowed to drive a certain number of hours at a time.

18
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,780
In the US, it's 11, in Europe, it's 9, and in the rest of the world it's something

19
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,460
similar to those two.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,520
Therefore, they need the facilities to live, rest, and recreate when off the road in those

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,820
remaining hours of the day.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,940
Most trucks have a cab just large enough for a bed, TV, microwave, and a few other small

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,940
appliances.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,580
They are typically intentionally minimalistic because there is a trade-off between the size

25
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,160
and weight of the cab and how much freight can be hauled.

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,420
This truly is a trade-off for the drivers mostly, as a big proportion of them in places

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,180
like the US usually own their truck themselves and work for companies on a freelance basis.

28
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,460
That means they could decide to buy a rig with a larger, more comfortable cab, but that

29
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,340
could make them less capable of hauling heavier loads, which means less money.

30
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,320
Trucks are weight restricted, mostly to keep the roads in decent condition.

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,060
The greater the weight, the greater the impact.

32
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,600
In the US, this maximum weight varies widely.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,540
On most highways, it's 80,000 pounds or 36,000 kilograms, but this varies from state

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,840
to state all the way up to 164,000 pounds or 75,000 kilograms in Michigan.

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,160
Considering this variance, states will typically have weigh stations near their borders on

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,000
major highways, as well as some spread out throughout the state.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,600
All trucks, except for some that have electronic systems allowing them to bypass, are required

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,200
to pull off onto massive scales to assure they're complying with the rules.

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,080
Using this opportunity, though, many weigh stations have become far more technologically

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,380
advanced to assure safety and compliance.

41
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,120
For example, thermal cameras will take an image of the wheels to assure the brakes are

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
working properly.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,160
If they're too cold, that could mean the brakes are not engaging.

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,740
If they're too hot, that could mean they're engaging too much, in comparison to the other

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,740
brakes.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,320
So, the weight issue, though, is why the average rig looks just like this—a compact cab with

47
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,920
just the bare minimum of comforts.

48
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,960
The tradeoff means that larger, extended sleepers are only common with, for example, long-haul

49
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,540
moving trucks, which, due to the low weight and density of the carried goods, rarely have

50
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,440
an issue with weight limits.

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,940
So, given that most trucks look like this, with just the bare bones of comforts, most

52
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:33,540
of the facilities truckers need are located in the places where they sleep—truck stops.

53
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,180
These dot large countries like the US with remarkable frequency, centered primarily along

54
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,020
highways and other common trucking routes.

55
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,740
They might look like large gas stations, but they offer far more.

56
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,040
Truck cabs typically don't have bathrooms or showers, so they almost always have those.

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,940
They also don't have laundry facilities, so truck stops often have those.

58
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,720
Some will also have banks, barbers, chiropractors, dentists, dog groomers, and more.

59
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,140
This is all because, once truckers are on the road, they're in the system and they

60
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,180
can't really leave it until they're back at their origin.

61
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,340
One can't just drive into a city and park to do some shopping in a semi-truck, both

62
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,180
practically and, in some cases, legally.

63
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,940
While truckers might travel more miles in a year than anyone else, the world for them,

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,780
while on the job, is limited to the roads, truck stops, and few other facilities catering

65
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,780
to them.

66
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,180
That's why services like dentists at truck stops are far from novelties—they're crucial

67
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,020
fixtures of a life on the road.

68
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,380
Truck drivers only make money when they're moving.

69
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Overwhelmingly, they are paid per mile, meaning the time during which they are legally mandated

70
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,020
to rest is unpaid.

71
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,580
Not only that, but time off actually loses money.

72
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,420
The whole game is an economic puzzle.

73
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,580
Trucks need power to run AC, heat, or electronics while stationary—all of which drivers typically

74
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,460
need when they're stopped.

75
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,860
Therefore, often, drivers leave their trucks idling overnight, which burns about 0.8 gallons

76
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,440
or 3 liters of diesel per hour.

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,220
At current prices, a 10-hour overnight stop would burn about $20 of diesel which, multiplied

78
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:17,620
by hundreds of nights per year per driver, is a significant cost and even greater environmental

79
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,620
burden.

80
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,460
In addition, this idling adds wear and tear to the engine and counts against a truck's

81
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
warranty.

82
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,780
Until recently, there really wasn't an alternative, except for sleeping without AC or heat, but

83
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,800
under increased pressure to improve its environmental footprint, the trucking industry has implemented

84
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,340
innovations such as auxiliary power units, smaller, more efficient generators, electric

85
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,820
plugins at truck stops, or even ducts installed to windows when stopped to provide climate

86
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,960
control.

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,300
This economic calculation extends beyond stops.

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,600
It also deals with optimizing the miles covered while following the laws.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
In the US, the rule is that one can drive up to 11 hours, over an overall period of

90
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,000
14 hours, and then must rest for 10 hours.

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,720
Assuming an average speed of 60 miles per hour, that means a truck can essentially travel

92
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,080
660 miles per day.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,360
Therefore, a cross-country trip from Los Angeles to New York would take about four and a half

94
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,540
days.

95
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,160
The drivers themselves are paid per mile, so all they want to do is maximize their speed

96
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,000
during the 11 hours of daily driving time.

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,160
The consumer, though, whoever's paying for the transport of the product in the back,

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,120
cares about how fast it gets to them overall.

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,320
Therefore, truckers have devised a system to move freight faster.

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,460
The rules just say that drivers have to rest for 10 hours in their cab.

101
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,700
It doesn't say that the trucks have to be stationary.

102
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,580
Drivers will therefore team up so that while one drives, the other sleeps, and vice versa.

103
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,620
A team of drivers, which is often made up of a married couple, can therefore drive 22

104
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,000
hours per day, covering 1,320 miles.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,600
That means that they could make the Los Angeles to New York trip in just two days.

106
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,260
Consumers will pay a premium for the speed, and therefore trucking companies will pay

107
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,760
more per mile.

108
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,360
In addition, having less stopped time means that the truck, which costs quite a lot, is

109
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,740
being used more efficiently.

110
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,000
This team system is all around a win for everyone, assuming one can find a pair of people that

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,680
will tolerate spending their lives cooped up in a truck cab together.

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,540
Truckers almost certainly are a dying breed, though.

113
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:30,960
The future of freight transport will undoubtedly center around self-driving trucks and the

114
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,360
technology for these is very close to ready for prime time.

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,340
Right now, multiple companies are at the point where their trucks are traveling autonomously,

116
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,760
with drivers behind the wheel to intervene if needed.

117
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,880
These are essentially autopilot systems, similar to Tesla's, that aid the driver and reduce

118
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,880
fatigue.

119
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,000
Soon, though, with more proven technology and legal authority to do so, this will likely

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,700
advance to autonomous convoys.

121
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,320
In this system, one driver would sit behind the wheel of a lead truck, which might also

122
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,960
drive autonomously, and then a series of autonomous humanless trucks would follow behind.

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,500
This way, there is still a human that can assist with mechanical issues or unforeseen

124
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,720
road conditions, but the freight-to-driver ratio increases dramatically.

125
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,920
This will, of course, reduce the number of truckers needed, but then, after this phase,

126
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,060
the industry will undoubtedly advance to fully autonomous trucks.

127
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:32,080
At first, this will likely just be on dedicated routes—for example, a company might deploy

128
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,000
these on uncomplicated routes from one warehouse to another, both being close to a highway.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,500
Autonomous driving on highways is relatively easy since road conditions are standardized

130
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,160
and predictable.

131
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,820
Autonomous city driving is much more complicated, so human drivers might still be needed for

132
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,500
the start and end of journeys.

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,800
What fully autonomous driving could do, though, is allow a truck to continue moving on the

134
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,740
highway while a driver rests in the back, allowing essentially continuous driving without

135
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,160
having to deal with working hour limits.

136
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,840
This, along with a convoy system, could increase the cost-efficiency of trucking dramatically

137
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,320
as the human drivers represent a significant cost.

138
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
An average trucker's pay is about 35 cents per mile, meaning that cutting out that cost

139
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,280
entirely would reduce the cost of a Los Angeles to New York trip, for example, by almost $1,000.

140
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:29,140
It is for this reason why so many companies are pursuing autonomous trucks.

141
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,600
Of course, the other major cost in trucking is fuel, so companies are also trying to innovate

142
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
in that space.

143
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,400
Concurrent to the deployment of autonomous trucks is a likely shift into the use of electric

144
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
trucks.

145
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Tesla, for example, is developing its own semi-truck.

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,060
They claim its energy consumption will be about 2 kilowatt hours per mile.

147
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,760
The US's average energy cost is about 10 cents per kilowatt hour which translates to

148
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,120
an energy cost of about 20 cents per mile.

149
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,620
Typical internal combustion semi-trucks have an efficiency of about 6 miles per gallon

150
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:10,260
so, at current diesel prices, that would translate to a cost of about 40 cents per mile.

151
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,920
Providing a trucking company's energy prices is certainly an intriguing proposition, which

152
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,920
is why many consider the Tesla semi so promising.

153
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,340
At those prices, if a truck goes driverless, meaning no salary costs, the variable cost

154
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:30,660
of a cross-country Los Angeles to New York run would be just $550.

155
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,740
To be able to haul tens of thousands of pounds of goods from door to door across the country

156
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:41,320
for just hundreds of dollars would result in a paradigm shift in the freight world.

157
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,220
There are certainly disadvantages, such as the high battery pack weight that reduces

158
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,240
cargo capacity, but it is clear that electric trucks will play some role in the industry

159
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,680
regardless in the near future.

160
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,960
This role will likely be concentrated in shorter routes rather than long haul ones, but this

161
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,820
is still a significant enough subset of the industry that electric trucks have the potential

162
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,380
for significant disruption.

163
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,440
Right now, there is a strange duality where truckers are so crucial to the running of

164
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,540
a modern economy that the world is working to replace them.

165
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,160
We can't live without them right now, so we're finding a way to.

166
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,940
In the future, though, the job of a trucker will undoubtedly be another victim of an increasingly

167
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,300
modernized world.

168
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,260
Another aspect of an increasingly modernized world is clearly more people working from

169
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,580
home and with that, it's more important than ever to be sure that you're using the

170
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,740
internet securely.

171
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,560
ExpressVPN can play a crucial component in that for you.

172
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,540
They assure that 100% of the data transferred between your device and the internet is encrypted,

173
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,740
therefore providing a layer of protection for everything you do online.

174
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,100
This is important because, for example, in the US, internet service providers can legally

175
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,940
sell your data to ad companies, and in the UK and Australia, they keep logs of your internet

176
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,420
activity for years.

177
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,380
In addition, you can route your traffic through any country to be extra sure it's safe against

178
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,060
government surveillance, or even just to get access to a bigger selection of online entertainment.

179
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:16,140
I've personally used ExpressVPN for years, far before they offered to sponsor the channel,

180
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,740
and have found that their simplicity and reliability makes them, definitively, the best VPN.

181
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:28,140
The best bit is, you can try ExpressVPN with three months free by going to expressvpn.com-slash-wendover

182
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,420
and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
