00:10.840 --> 00:14.840
When you think of freight transport, the image in your head might include massive container

00:14.840 --> 00:21.540
ships or mile-long trains or enormous cargo planes, but more than each of those, the transportation

00:21.540 --> 00:26.940
method that carries the vast majority of the world's freight is trucks.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.540
In most places, it's not even close.

00:29.540 --> 00:34.500
By value, they carry 73% of the US's domestic freight.

00:34.500 --> 00:39.060
It is truly trucks that connect to the world more than anything else.

00:39.060 --> 00:43.380
Trucking fills a lot of roles from just daily deliveries to urban households all the way

00:43.380 --> 00:47.720
to cross-country treks bringing goods from manufacturer to consumer.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.100
It is that form, though—long-haul, over-the-road trucking—that is most elusive.

00:53.100 --> 00:57.420
These trucks are visible on the highways of any country, but the infrastructure supporting

00:57.420 --> 01:01.620
this transportation system hides in plain sight.

01:01.620 --> 01:06.300
When on the road, long-haul truckers live and work in their trucks.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.940
Of course their job is centered around sitting behind the wheel, but the section behind that

01:10.940 --> 01:12.780
is where they live.

01:12.780 --> 01:16.500
Drivers are only allowed to drive a certain number of hours at a time.

01:16.500 --> 01:20.780
In the US, it's 11, in Europe, it's 9, and in the rest of the world it's something

01:20.780 --> 01:22.460
similar to those two.

01:22.500 --> 01:27.520
Therefore, they need the facilities to live, rest, and recreate when off the road in those

01:27.520 --> 01:29.820
remaining hours of the day.

01:29.820 --> 01:34.940
Most trucks have a cab just large enough for a bed, TV, microwave, and a few other small

01:34.940 --> 01:35.940
appliances.

01:35.940 --> 01:40.580
They are typically intentionally minimalistic because there is a trade-off between the size

01:40.580 --> 01:44.160
and weight of the cab and how much freight can be hauled.

01:44.160 --> 01:48.420
This truly is a trade-off for the drivers mostly, as a big proportion of them in places

01:48.420 --> 01:54.180
like the US usually own their truck themselves and work for companies on a freelance basis.

01:54.180 --> 01:58.460
That means they could decide to buy a rig with a larger, more comfortable cab, but that

01:58.460 --> 02:03.340
could make them less capable of hauling heavier loads, which means less money.

02:03.340 --> 02:07.320
Trucks are weight restricted, mostly to keep the roads in decent condition.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.060
The greater the weight, the greater the impact.

02:10.060 --> 02:13.600
In the US, this maximum weight varies widely.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.540
On most highways, it's 80,000 pounds or 36,000 kilograms, but this varies from state

02:18.540 --> 02:24.840
to state all the way up to 164,000 pounds or 75,000 kilograms in Michigan.

02:24.840 --> 02:29.160
Considering this variance, states will typically have weigh stations near their borders on

02:29.160 --> 02:33.000
major highways, as well as some spread out throughout the state.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.600
All trucks, except for some that have electronic systems allowing them to bypass, are required

02:37.600 --> 02:42.200
to pull off onto massive scales to assure they're complying with the rules.

02:42.200 --> 02:46.080
Using this opportunity, though, many weigh stations have become far more technologically

02:46.080 --> 02:49.380
advanced to assure safety and compliance.

02:49.380 --> 02:53.120
For example, thermal cameras will take an image of the wheels to assure the brakes are

02:53.120 --> 02:54.120
working properly.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.160
If they're too cold, that could mean the brakes are not engaging.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.740
If they're too hot, that could mean they're engaging too much, in comparison to the other

03:00.740 --> 03:01.740
brakes.

03:01.740 --> 03:08.320
So, the weight issue, though, is why the average rig looks just like this—a compact cab with

03:08.320 --> 03:10.920
just the bare minimum of comforts.

03:10.920 --> 03:15.960
The tradeoff means that larger, extended sleepers are only common with, for example, long-haul

03:15.960 --> 03:20.540
moving trucks, which, due to the low weight and density of the carried goods, rarely have

03:20.540 --> 03:22.440
an issue with weight limits.

03:22.440 --> 03:27.940
So, given that most trucks look like this, with just the bare bones of comforts, most

03:27.940 --> 03:33.540
of the facilities truckers need are located in the places where they sleep—truck stops.

03:33.540 --> 03:38.180
These dot large countries like the US with remarkable frequency, centered primarily along

03:38.180 --> 03:41.020
highways and other common trucking routes.

03:41.020 --> 03:45.740
They might look like large gas stations, but they offer far more.

03:45.740 --> 03:51.040
Truck cabs typically don't have bathrooms or showers, so they almost always have those.

03:51.040 --> 03:54.940
They also don't have laundry facilities, so truck stops often have those.

03:54.940 --> 04:00.720
Some will also have banks, barbers, chiropractors, dentists, dog groomers, and more.

04:00.720 --> 04:05.140
This is all because, once truckers are on the road, they're in the system and they

04:05.140 --> 04:08.180
can't really leave it until they're back at their origin.

04:08.180 --> 04:12.340
One can't just drive into a city and park to do some shopping in a semi-truck, both

04:12.340 --> 04:15.180
practically and, in some cases, legally.

04:15.180 --> 04:19.940
While truckers might travel more miles in a year than anyone else, the world for them,

04:19.940 --> 04:24.780
while on the job, is limited to the roads, truck stops, and few other facilities catering

04:24.780 --> 04:25.780
to them.

04:25.780 --> 04:31.180
That's why services like dentists at truck stops are far from novelties—they're crucial

04:31.180 --> 04:34.020
fixtures of a life on the road.

04:34.020 --> 04:37.380
Truck drivers only make money when they're moving.

04:37.380 --> 04:42.380
Overwhelmingly, they are paid per mile, meaning the time during which they are legally mandated

04:42.380 --> 04:45.020
to rest is unpaid.

04:45.020 --> 04:48.580
Not only that, but time off actually loses money.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.420
The whole game is an economic puzzle.

04:51.420 --> 04:56.580
Trucks need power to run AC, heat, or electronics while stationary—all of which drivers typically

04:56.580 --> 04:58.460
need when they're stopped.

04:58.460 --> 05:03.860
Therefore, often, drivers leave their trucks idling overnight, which burns about 0.8 gallons

05:03.860 --> 05:06.440
or 3 liters of diesel per hour.

05:06.440 --> 05:12.220
At current prices, a 10-hour overnight stop would burn about $20 of diesel which, multiplied

05:12.220 --> 05:17.620
by hundreds of nights per year per driver, is a significant cost and even greater environmental

05:17.620 --> 05:18.620
burden.

05:18.620 --> 05:23.460
In addition, this idling adds wear and tear to the engine and counts against a truck's

05:23.460 --> 05:24.460
warranty.

05:24.460 --> 05:28.780
Until recently, there really wasn't an alternative, except for sleeping without AC or heat, but

05:28.780 --> 05:33.800
under increased pressure to improve its environmental footprint, the trucking industry has implemented

05:33.800 --> 05:38.340
innovations such as auxiliary power units, smaller, more efficient generators, electric

05:38.340 --> 05:42.820
plugins at truck stops, or even ducts installed to windows when stopped to provide climate

05:42.820 --> 05:43.960
control.

05:43.960 --> 05:47.300
This economic calculation extends beyond stops.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.600
It also deals with optimizing the miles covered while following the laws.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.400
In the US, the rule is that one can drive up to 11 hours, over an overall period of

05:56.400 --> 06:00.000
14 hours, and then must rest for 10 hours.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.720
Assuming an average speed of 60 miles per hour, that means a truck can essentially travel

06:04.720 --> 06:07.080
660 miles per day.

06:07.080 --> 06:12.360
Therefore, a cross-country trip from Los Angeles to New York would take about four and a half

06:12.360 --> 06:13.540
days.

06:13.540 --> 06:18.160
The drivers themselves are paid per mile, so all they want to do is maximize their speed

06:18.160 --> 06:21.000
during the 11 hours of daily driving time.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.160
The consumer, though, whoever's paying for the transport of the product in the back,

06:25.160 --> 06:28.120
cares about how fast it gets to them overall.

06:28.120 --> 06:33.320
Therefore, truckers have devised a system to move freight faster.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.460
The rules just say that drivers have to rest for 10 hours in their cab.

06:37.460 --> 06:40.700
It doesn't say that the trucks have to be stationary.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.580
Drivers will therefore team up so that while one drives, the other sleeps, and vice versa.

06:45.580 --> 06:50.620
A team of drivers, which is often made up of a married couple, can therefore drive 22

06:50.620 --> 06:54.000
hours per day, covering 1,320 miles.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.600
That means that they could make the Los Angeles to New York trip in just two days.

06:59.600 --> 07:03.260
Consumers will pay a premium for the speed, and therefore trucking companies will pay

07:03.260 --> 07:04.760
more per mile.

07:04.760 --> 07:09.360
In addition, having less stopped time means that the truck, which costs quite a lot, is

07:09.360 --> 07:11.740
being used more efficiently.

07:11.740 --> 07:17.000
This team system is all around a win for everyone, assuming one can find a pair of people that

07:17.000 --> 07:21.680
will tolerate spending their lives cooped up in a truck cab together.

07:21.680 --> 07:25.540
Truckers almost certainly are a dying breed, though.

07:25.540 --> 07:30.960
The future of freight transport will undoubtedly center around self-driving trucks and the

07:30.960 --> 07:35.360
technology for these is very close to ready for prime time.

07:35.360 --> 07:40.340
Right now, multiple companies are at the point where their trucks are traveling autonomously,

07:40.340 --> 07:43.760
with drivers behind the wheel to intervene if needed.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.880
These are essentially autopilot systems, similar to Tesla's, that aid the driver and reduce

07:48.880 --> 07:49.880
fatigue.

07:49.920 --> 07:55.000
Soon, though, with more proven technology and legal authority to do so, this will likely

07:55.000 --> 07:57.700
advance to autonomous convoys.

07:57.700 --> 08:02.320
In this system, one driver would sit behind the wheel of a lead truck, which might also

08:02.320 --> 08:07.960
drive autonomously, and then a series of autonomous humanless trucks would follow behind.

08:07.960 --> 08:12.500
This way, there is still a human that can assist with mechanical issues or unforeseen

08:12.500 --> 08:17.720
road conditions, but the freight-to-driver ratio increases dramatically.

08:17.720 --> 08:22.920
This will, of course, reduce the number of truckers needed, but then, after this phase,

08:22.920 --> 08:27.060
the industry will undoubtedly advance to fully autonomous trucks.

08:27.060 --> 08:32.080
At first, this will likely just be on dedicated routes—for example, a company might deploy

08:32.080 --> 08:38.000
these on uncomplicated routes from one warehouse to another, both being close to a highway.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.500
Autonomous driving on highways is relatively easy since road conditions are standardized

08:42.500 --> 08:44.160
and predictable.

08:44.160 --> 08:48.820
Autonomous city driving is much more complicated, so human drivers might still be needed for

08:48.820 --> 08:51.500
the start and end of journeys.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.800
What fully autonomous driving could do, though, is allow a truck to continue moving on the

08:55.800 --> 09:00.740
highway while a driver rests in the back, allowing essentially continuous driving without

09:00.740 --> 09:03.160
having to deal with working hour limits.

09:03.160 --> 09:08.840
This, along with a convoy system, could increase the cost-efficiency of trucking dramatically

09:08.840 --> 09:12.320
as the human drivers represent a significant cost.

09:12.320 --> 09:17.200
An average trucker's pay is about 35 cents per mile, meaning that cutting out that cost

09:17.200 --> 09:23.280
entirely would reduce the cost of a Los Angeles to New York trip, for example, by almost $1,000.

09:23.280 --> 09:29.140
It is for this reason why so many companies are pursuing autonomous trucks.

09:29.140 --> 09:34.600
Of course, the other major cost in trucking is fuel, so companies are also trying to innovate

09:34.600 --> 09:36.080
in that space.

09:36.080 --> 09:41.400
Concurrent to the deployment of autonomous trucks is a likely shift into the use of electric

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
trucks.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.200
Tesla, for example, is developing its own semi-truck.

09:46.200 --> 09:51.060
They claim its energy consumption will be about 2 kilowatt hours per mile.

09:51.060 --> 09:55.760
The US's average energy cost is about 10 cents per kilowatt hour which translates to

09:55.760 --> 09:59.120
an energy cost of about 20 cents per mile.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.620
Typical internal combustion semi-trucks have an efficiency of about 6 miles per gallon

10:03.620 --> 10:10.260
so, at current diesel prices, that would translate to a cost of about 40 cents per mile.

10:10.260 --> 10:14.920
Providing a trucking company's energy prices is certainly an intriguing proposition, which

10:14.920 --> 10:18.920
is why many consider the Tesla semi so promising.

10:18.920 --> 10:24.340
At those prices, if a truck goes driverless, meaning no salary costs, the variable cost

10:24.340 --> 10:30.660
of a cross-country Los Angeles to New York run would be just $550.

10:30.660 --> 10:35.740
To be able to haul tens of thousands of pounds of goods from door to door across the country

10:35.740 --> 10:41.320
for just hundreds of dollars would result in a paradigm shift in the freight world.

10:41.320 --> 10:45.220
There are certainly disadvantages, such as the high battery pack weight that reduces

10:45.220 --> 10:50.240
cargo capacity, but it is clear that electric trucks will play some role in the industry

10:50.240 --> 10:52.680
regardless in the near future.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.960
This role will likely be concentrated in shorter routes rather than long haul ones, but this

10:56.960 --> 11:01.820
is still a significant enough subset of the industry that electric trucks have the potential

11:01.820 --> 11:04.380
for significant disruption.

11:04.380 --> 11:09.440
Right now, there is a strange duality where truckers are so crucial to the running of

11:09.440 --> 11:13.540
a modern economy that the world is working to replace them.

11:13.540 --> 11:18.160
We can't live without them right now, so we're finding a way to.

11:18.160 --> 11:23.940
In the future, though, the job of a trucker will undoubtedly be another victim of an increasingly

11:23.940 --> 11:27.300
modernized world.

11:27.300 --> 11:31.260
Another aspect of an increasingly modernized world is clearly more people working from

11:31.260 --> 11:35.580
home and with that, it's more important than ever to be sure that you're using the

11:35.580 --> 11:37.740
internet securely.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.560
ExpressVPN can play a crucial component in that for you.

11:41.560 --> 11:46.540
They assure that 100% of the data transferred between your device and the internet is encrypted,

11:46.540 --> 11:50.740
therefore providing a layer of protection for everything you do online.

11:50.740 --> 11:55.100
This is important because, for example, in the US, internet service providers can legally

11:55.100 --> 11:59.940
sell your data to ad companies, and in the UK and Australia, they keep logs of your internet

11:59.940 --> 12:01.420
activity for years.

12:01.420 --> 12:06.380
In addition, you can route your traffic through any country to be extra sure it's safe against

12:06.380 --> 12:11.060
government surveillance, or even just to get access to a bigger selection of online entertainment.

12:11.060 --> 12:16.140
I've personally used ExpressVPN for years, far before they offered to sponsor the channel,

12:16.140 --> 12:21.740
and have found that their simplicity and reliability makes them, definitively, the best VPN.

12:21.740 --> 12:28.140
The best bit is, you can try ExpressVPN with three months free by going to expressvpn.com-slash-wendover

12:28.140 --> 12:30.420
and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
