10840	14840	When you think of freight transport, the image in your head might include massive container
14840	21540	ships or mile-long trains or enormous cargo planes, but more than each of those, the transportation
21540	26940	method that carries the vast majority of the world's freight is trucks.
26940	29540	In most places, it's not even close.
29540	34500	By value, they carry 73% of the US's domestic freight.
34500	39060	It is truly trucks that connect to the world more than anything else.
39060	43380	Trucking fills a lot of roles from just daily deliveries to urban households all the way
43380	47720	to cross-country treks bringing goods from manufacturer to consumer.
47720	53100	It is that form, though—long-haul, over-the-road trucking—that is most elusive.
53100	57420	These trucks are visible on the highways of any country, but the infrastructure supporting
57420	61620	this transportation system hides in plain sight.
61620	66300	When on the road, long-haul truckers live and work in their trucks.
66300	70940	Of course their job is centered around sitting behind the wheel, but the section behind that
70940	72780	is where they live.
72780	76500	Drivers are only allowed to drive a certain number of hours at a time.
76500	80780	In the US, it's 11, in Europe, it's 9, and in the rest of the world it's something
80780	82460	similar to those two.
82500	87520	Therefore, they need the facilities to live, rest, and recreate when off the road in those
87520	89820	remaining hours of the day.
89820	94940	Most trucks have a cab just large enough for a bed, TV, microwave, and a few other small
94940	95940	appliances.
95940	100580	They are typically intentionally minimalistic because there is a trade-off between the size
100580	104160	and weight of the cab and how much freight can be hauled.
104160	108420	This truly is a trade-off for the drivers mostly, as a big proportion of them in places
108420	114180	like the US usually own their truck themselves and work for companies on a freelance basis.
114180	118460	That means they could decide to buy a rig with a larger, more comfortable cab, but that
118460	123340	could make them less capable of hauling heavier loads, which means less money.
123340	127320	Trucks are weight restricted, mostly to keep the roads in decent condition.
127320	130060	The greater the weight, the greater the impact.
130060	133600	In the US, this maximum weight varies widely.
133600	138540	On most highways, it's 80,000 pounds or 36,000 kilograms, but this varies from state
138540	144840	to state all the way up to 164,000 pounds or 75,000 kilograms in Michigan.
144840	149160	Considering this variance, states will typically have weigh stations near their borders on
149160	153000	major highways, as well as some spread out throughout the state.
153000	157600	All trucks, except for some that have electronic systems allowing them to bypass, are required
157600	162200	to pull off onto massive scales to assure they're complying with the rules.
162200	166080	Using this opportunity, though, many weigh stations have become far more technologically
166080	169380	advanced to assure safety and compliance.
169380	173120	For example, thermal cameras will take an image of the wheels to assure the brakes are
173120	174120	working properly.
174120	177160	If they're too cold, that could mean the brakes are not engaging.
177160	180740	If they're too hot, that could mean they're engaging too much, in comparison to the other
180740	181740	brakes.
181740	188320	So, the weight issue, though, is why the average rig looks just like this—a compact cab with
188320	190920	just the bare minimum of comforts.
190920	195960	The tradeoff means that larger, extended sleepers are only common with, for example, long-haul
195960	200540	moving trucks, which, due to the low weight and density of the carried goods, rarely have
200540	202440	an issue with weight limits.
202440	207940	So, given that most trucks look like this, with just the bare bones of comforts, most
207940	213540	of the facilities truckers need are located in the places where they sleep—truck stops.
213540	218180	These dot large countries like the US with remarkable frequency, centered primarily along
218180	221020	highways and other common trucking routes.
221020	225740	They might look like large gas stations, but they offer far more.
225740	231040	Truck cabs typically don't have bathrooms or showers, so they almost always have those.
231040	234940	They also don't have laundry facilities, so truck stops often have those.
234940	240720	Some will also have banks, barbers, chiropractors, dentists, dog groomers, and more.
240720	245140	This is all because, once truckers are on the road, they're in the system and they
245140	248180	can't really leave it until they're back at their origin.
248180	252340	One can't just drive into a city and park to do some shopping in a semi-truck, both
252340	255180	practically and, in some cases, legally.
255180	259940	While truckers might travel more miles in a year than anyone else, the world for them,
259940	264780	while on the job, is limited to the roads, truck stops, and few other facilities catering
264780	265780	to them.
265780	271180	That's why services like dentists at truck stops are far from novelties—they're crucial
271180	274020	fixtures of a life on the road.
274020	277380	Truck drivers only make money when they're moving.
277380	282380	Overwhelmingly, they are paid per mile, meaning the time during which they are legally mandated
282380	285020	to rest is unpaid.
285020	288580	Not only that, but time off actually loses money.
288580	291420	The whole game is an economic puzzle.
291420	296580	Trucks need power to run AC, heat, or electronics while stationary—all of which drivers typically
296580	298460	need when they're stopped.
298460	303860	Therefore, often, drivers leave their trucks idling overnight, which burns about 0.8 gallons
303860	306440	or 3 liters of diesel per hour.
306440	312220	At current prices, a 10-hour overnight stop would burn about $20 of diesel which, multiplied
312220	317620	by hundreds of nights per year per driver, is a significant cost and even greater environmental
317620	318620	burden.
318620	323460	In addition, this idling adds wear and tear to the engine and counts against a truck's
323460	324460	warranty.
324460	328780	Until recently, there really wasn't an alternative, except for sleeping without AC or heat, but
328780	333800	under increased pressure to improve its environmental footprint, the trucking industry has implemented
333800	338340	innovations such as auxiliary power units, smaller, more efficient generators, electric
338340	342820	plugins at truck stops, or even ducts installed to windows when stopped to provide climate
342820	343960	control.
343960	347300	This economic calculation extends beyond stops.
347300	351600	It also deals with optimizing the miles covered while following the laws.
351600	356400	In the US, the rule is that one can drive up to 11 hours, over an overall period of
356400	360000	14 hours, and then must rest for 10 hours.
360000	364720	Assuming an average speed of 60 miles per hour, that means a truck can essentially travel
364720	367080	660 miles per day.
367080	372360	Therefore, a cross-country trip from Los Angeles to New York would take about four and a half
372360	373540	days.
373540	378160	The drivers themselves are paid per mile, so all they want to do is maximize their speed
378160	381000	during the 11 hours of daily driving time.
381000	385160	The consumer, though, whoever's paying for the transport of the product in the back,
385160	388120	cares about how fast it gets to them overall.
388120	393320	Therefore, truckers have devised a system to move freight faster.
393320	397460	The rules just say that drivers have to rest for 10 hours in their cab.
397460	400700	It doesn't say that the trucks have to be stationary.
400700	405580	Drivers will therefore team up so that while one drives, the other sleeps, and vice versa.
405580	410620	A team of drivers, which is often made up of a married couple, can therefore drive 22
410620	414000	hours per day, covering 1,320 miles.
414000	419600	That means that they could make the Los Angeles to New York trip in just two days.
419600	423260	Consumers will pay a premium for the speed, and therefore trucking companies will pay
423260	424760	more per mile.
424760	429360	In addition, having less stopped time means that the truck, which costs quite a lot, is
429360	431740	being used more efficiently.
431740	437000	This team system is all around a win for everyone, assuming one can find a pair of people that
437000	441680	will tolerate spending their lives cooped up in a truck cab together.
441680	445540	Truckers almost certainly are a dying breed, though.
445540	450960	The future of freight transport will undoubtedly center around self-driving trucks and the
450960	455360	technology for these is very close to ready for prime time.
455360	460340	Right now, multiple companies are at the point where their trucks are traveling autonomously,
460340	463760	with drivers behind the wheel to intervene if needed.
463760	468880	These are essentially autopilot systems, similar to Tesla's, that aid the driver and reduce
468880	469880	fatigue.
469920	475000	Soon, though, with more proven technology and legal authority to do so, this will likely
475000	477700	advance to autonomous convoys.
477700	482320	In this system, one driver would sit behind the wheel of a lead truck, which might also
482320	487960	drive autonomously, and then a series of autonomous humanless trucks would follow behind.
487960	492500	This way, there is still a human that can assist with mechanical issues or unforeseen
492500	497720	road conditions, but the freight-to-driver ratio increases dramatically.
497720	502920	This will, of course, reduce the number of truckers needed, but then, after this phase,
502920	507060	the industry will undoubtedly advance to fully autonomous trucks.
507060	512080	At first, this will likely just be on dedicated routes—for example, a company might deploy
512080	518000	these on uncomplicated routes from one warehouse to another, both being close to a highway.
518000	522500	Autonomous driving on highways is relatively easy since road conditions are standardized
522500	524160	and predictable.
524160	528820	Autonomous city driving is much more complicated, so human drivers might still be needed for
528820	531500	the start and end of journeys.
531500	535800	What fully autonomous driving could do, though, is allow a truck to continue moving on the
535800	540740	highway while a driver rests in the back, allowing essentially continuous driving without
540740	543160	having to deal with working hour limits.
543160	548840	This, along with a convoy system, could increase the cost-efficiency of trucking dramatically
548840	552320	as the human drivers represent a significant cost.
552320	557200	An average trucker's pay is about 35 cents per mile, meaning that cutting out that cost
557200	563280	entirely would reduce the cost of a Los Angeles to New York trip, for example, by almost $1,000.
563280	569140	It is for this reason why so many companies are pursuing autonomous trucks.
569140	574600	Of course, the other major cost in trucking is fuel, so companies are also trying to innovate
574600	576080	in that space.
576080	581400	Concurrent to the deployment of autonomous trucks is a likely shift into the use of electric
581400	582400	trucks.
582400	586200	Tesla, for example, is developing its own semi-truck.
586200	591060	They claim its energy consumption will be about 2 kilowatt hours per mile.
591060	595760	The US's average energy cost is about 10 cents per kilowatt hour which translates to
595760	599120	an energy cost of about 20 cents per mile.
599120	603620	Typical internal combustion semi-trucks have an efficiency of about 6 miles per gallon
603620	610260	so, at current diesel prices, that would translate to a cost of about 40 cents per mile.
610260	614920	Providing a trucking company's energy prices is certainly an intriguing proposition, which
614920	618920	is why many consider the Tesla semi so promising.
618920	624340	At those prices, if a truck goes driverless, meaning no salary costs, the variable cost
624340	630660	of a cross-country Los Angeles to New York run would be just $550.
630660	635740	To be able to haul tens of thousands of pounds of goods from door to door across the country
635740	641320	for just hundreds of dollars would result in a paradigm shift in the freight world.
641320	645220	There are certainly disadvantages, such as the high battery pack weight that reduces
645220	650240	cargo capacity, but it is clear that electric trucks will play some role in the industry
650240	652680	regardless in the near future.
652680	656960	This role will likely be concentrated in shorter routes rather than long haul ones, but this
656960	661820	is still a significant enough subset of the industry that electric trucks have the potential
661820	664380	for significant disruption.
664380	669440	Right now, there is a strange duality where truckers are so crucial to the running of
669440	673540	a modern economy that the world is working to replace them.
673540	678160	We can't live without them right now, so we're finding a way to.
678160	683940	In the future, though, the job of a trucker will undoubtedly be another victim of an increasingly
683940	687300	modernized world.
687300	691260	Another aspect of an increasingly modernized world is clearly more people working from
691260	695580	home and with that, it's more important than ever to be sure that you're using the
695580	697740	internet securely.
697740	701560	ExpressVPN can play a crucial component in that for you.
701560	706540	They assure that 100% of the data transferred between your device and the internet is encrypted,
706540	710740	therefore providing a layer of protection for everything you do online.
710740	715100	This is important because, for example, in the US, internet service providers can legally
715100	719940	sell your data to ad companies, and in the UK and Australia, they keep logs of your internet
719940	721420	activity for years.
721420	726380	In addition, you can route your traffic through any country to be extra sure it's safe against
726380	731060	government surveillance, or even just to get access to a bigger selection of online entertainment.
731060	736140	I've personally used ExpressVPN for years, far before they offered to sponsor the channel,
736140	741740	and have found that their simplicity and reliability makes them, definitively, the best VPN.
741740	748140	The best bit is, you can try ExpressVPN with three months free by going to expressvpn.com-slash-wendover
748140	750420	and you'll be supporting the channel while you're at it.
