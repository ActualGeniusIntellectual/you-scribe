9760	16000	Fifty years ago, Iceland was an afterthought—a small, barren, insignificant island in the
16000	17200	North Atlantic.
17200	21280	It had little money, little power, and a tiny population.
21280	24120	Its economy was primarily dependent on fishing.
24120	28480	The country sits in an area with plentiful supplies of desirable species of fish and
28480	32640	the capture and processing of this resource proved a stable source of employment for the
32640	37000	country's small population, but it was not a sector that could push the country onto
37000	38120	the world stage.
38120	43080	Iceland's economy had little blips of growth throughout the 80s and 90s, but none permanent
43080	48320	or significant, but then, in the 90s, economic reform occurred.
48320	52840	Taxes were slashed, state-owned enterprises were privatized, and slow but constant growth
52840	53840	began.
53840	58640	It continued, briefly faltered, and then just exploded.
58640	62800	Private industry took hold of the economy, the financial industry was deregulated, and
62800	67140	Iceland's banks came to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.
67140	70640	By 2008, Iceland was the fourth richest country in the world.
70640	72760	It was on top of the world.
72760	75920	Reykjavik became a small but significant financial capital.
75920	82060	It had everything a small country could want—money, power, attention—but then it all just came
82060	83760	crashing down.
83760	85940	The economy imploded.
85940	90360	As the global recession began, trust in Iceland's small banks started to fall and so did the
90360	92240	value of the Icelandic krona.
92240	95840	Customers came to withdraw their savings, and the banks just didn't have the money
95840	96840	to give them.
96840	101880	Iceland's banks dealt with ten times more money than the entire GDP of Iceland, so the
101880	103700	country just couldn't bail them out.
103700	107920	The banks collapsed, and with them, the country's economy did too.
107920	110380	But Iceland had other assets.
110380	113440	One of tourism's biggest barriers is accessibility.
113440	118040	If you can't get to a place, no matter how much you want to go, you won't go.
118040	122280	As an extreme example, almost anyone would probably like to visit the South Pole and
122280	127400	you can visit the South Pole, it just costs tens of thousands of dollars.
127400	131340	If you took a few zeroes off that number, the number of zeroes on the visitor count
131340	133400	would certainly go up.
133400	136640	In Iceland's case, it already had accessibility.
136640	143320	Despite its population of only around 340,000, Iceland has long had a fairly large airline.
143320	144520	Icelandair.
144520	149560	You see, in the 1950s, international airline travel was all heavily regulated with most
149560	154000	prices fixed by IATA so airlines had little ability to compete on price.
154000	159120	While a route like New York to London non-stop would be IATA regulated, a connecting itinerary
159120	163820	from New York to Reykjavik to Luxembourg, on the other hand, would not be IATA regulated
163820	168340	as it was a connecting itinerary so this is what Icelandair flew.
168340	173240	With this, they could undercut other airlines' fares by hundreds of dollars.
173240	177540	Thus, Icelandair became one of the first ever budget airlines and it grew into the
177540	182680	transatlantic airline of choice for students, backpackers, and other travelers on a budget.
182680	186320	Its number of planes and destinations grew and grew and all of these people were flying
186320	190880	through Iceland, but they weren't actually going to Iceland.
190880	195760	By 2005, more than 2 million passengers were flying through Keflavik Airport, Icelandair's
195760	201640	hub, annually despite only 370,000 of those actually visiting Iceland.
201640	208360	Of course, the other asset Iceland has are things people want to see—unspoiled, unbridled,
208360	209360	natural beauty.
209360	213720	It is one of the most spectacular and unique natural environments in the world and it's
213720	216640	only a two-hour flight away from the UK.
216640	222540	Now, there was just one more thing Iceland needed in its tourism recipe—affordability.
222540	227680	With the 2008 financial crisis and banking industry collapse, the Icelandic krona, too,
227680	228680	collapsed.
228720	233480	Beginning to end of 2008, its value against the US dollar halved with a similar story
233480	234760	against the euro.
234760	239280	Of course, that meant that those using the dollar and euro, Americans and Europeans,
239280	242080	could buy more for less in Iceland.
242080	248360	So, Iceland had accessibility, it had affordability, it had sights people wanted to see, it had
248360	253440	all the fuel for a tourism explosion, it just needed ignition.
253440	258200	In a way, the very event that collapsed the Icelandic economy initiated the start of its
258200	259580	revitalization.
259580	264040	The Icelandic banking collapse made world headlines and placed Iceland on the map.
264040	269520	Then, in 2010, two years after the economic crash, Iceland made even bigger headlines
269520	272680	with the volcanic eruption of Eyjaflattja jökull.
272680	276980	The ash cloud that ensued drifted over Europe preventing almost all flights from operating
276980	279680	for a period of six and a half days.
279680	284940	All in all, over 100,000 flights were cancelled because of Iceland's ash cloud but because
284940	290120	of that, reporters from all around the world descended on Iceland broadcasting images of
290120	293520	the nation's volcanoes into the homes of millions.
293520	297880	It was free, worldwide advertisement for Iceland's natural beauty.
297880	302180	A few years after that, Iceland became the smallest nation ever to qualify for a major
302180	306880	tournament as its national football team competed in the Euro 2016 tournament.
306880	311240	The team lost but received significant attention for its qualification and then it ultimately
311240	314920	qualified and competed in the 2018 World Cup.
314920	320060	With these three events, Iceland was now known, its tourism industry had ignition, and word
320060	321640	spread fast.
321640	327620	It became the tourism destination of the 2010s, especially for Europeans and Americans.
327620	331800	Iceland hit double-digit tourism growth year over year, year after year.
331800	336120	They had their first year with a million visitors and then only two years after that they had
336120	338560	their first year with two million.
338560	341080	Tourists just would not stop coming.
341080	345280	New hotels opened every month, new rentals opened every day.
345280	349200	Iceland's roads carried a non-stop procession of camper vans.
349200	353240	New routes were opening to Keflavik airport faster than they could build gates.
353240	356320	Icelandair was adding new destinations left and right.
356320	360720	Soon enough, you could get to Iceland non-stop for more than 50 cities worldwide.
360720	366280	A second Icelandic airline, Wow Air, opened up and was soon to fly thousands of people
366280	368700	into Iceland each day.
368700	374640	Iceland had real, considerable GDP growth topping out at over 7% annually—almost unheard
374640	376520	of for a wealthy nation.
376520	382640	Now, taking a step back, worldwide, the tourism industry is absolutely enormous.
382640	388440	$1.6 trillion was spent on international tourism alone in 2017.
388440	393380	Capturing a part of this industry is a viable strategy for economic development.
393380	397880	Some countries grow off manufacturing, some off mining, and some off tourism.
397880	402440	Now, in the past century, there are so many stories of countries that went from nothing
402440	405880	to something in an instant thanks to oil.
405880	409920	All of these countries, though, know that oil is finite and that they need to use the
409920	414720	wealth that oil generates to develop new industries if they want to survive as wealthy nations
414720	416840	in a post-oil economy.
416840	421320	The UAE, for example, is one of the better diversified oil economies.
421320	426240	Oil revenues have gone from accounting for 90% of the country's GDP in the 70s to around
426240	427240	25% today.
427240	432280	A lot of this growth in non-oil industries came from an aggressive pursuit of foreign
432280	436480	direct investment to become the definitive business hub for the Middle East, but an industry
436480	439600	that played no small part is that of tourism.
439600	444980	21 million people visited the UAE in 2018—quite impressive for a country physically smaller
444980	450380	than Iceland, and even more impressive considering that the number was only 12 million in 2012.
450380	454780	As a country with fewer natural tourism assets than Iceland, the UAE government has put a
454780	459500	lot of focus into crafting Dubai into the entertainment capital of the Middle East to
459500	461140	draw these tourists in.
461140	466700	As a result of these efforts, economically, the UAE has gone from nothing to an unstable,
466700	471220	oil-based something to a diversified something that will likely survive a future without
471220	472340	oil.
472340	476860	Other nearby oil-dependent economies are paying attention to the UAE's path.
476860	481900	Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman have all each also indicated their intention to
481900	486220	grow tourism to be a sizable element of their post-oil economies.
486220	490400	This is part of the reason, mimicking Emirates and the UAE, that these neighbors have devoted
490400	495500	vast sums of money into developing and improving their state-owned airlines—Saudia, Gulf
495500	498660	Air, Qatar Airways, and Oman Air.
498660	502620	Being the story of Iceland even further, Qatar has already established itself as a
502620	507140	major connecting airline hub thanks to its advantageous geographic position and is using
507140	511700	this to introduce more and more people to the country itself in the lead up to the 2022
511700	513240	Qatar World Cup.
513240	515300	But tourism has its limitations.
515300	520540	It can do a great job of pushing up those indicators, but not all economic growth is
520540	522060	created equal.
522060	527460	For one, tourism is a service industry and these jobs are low wage.
527460	531980	Clearly, most people who are working as banking executives in Iceland's collapsed finance
531980	535540	industry are not going to start working in hotels.
535540	540940	As such a high wage country, Icelanders are just a bit too expensive for many of the jobs
540940	542520	in the tourism industry.
542520	548140	As a result, Iceland opened its borders slightly and 32% of those now working in its tourism
548140	551940	industry are foreigners—many from lower wage countries.
551940	559220	Tellingly, 37% of staff in Icelandic hotels are Polish while only 24% are Icelandic.
559220	563820	Of course, Iceland has absolutely no problem with unemployment right now, which is mostly
563820	569180	a good thing, but the labor that's in demand is low paid with limited upward potential.
569180	572280	Nobody's making their millions manning front desks.
572280	575780	In addition, the tourism industry is highly seasonal.
575780	582580	Given Iceland in 2017, just 13.6% of total visits happened in the entire season of spring.
582580	586900	It's hard to offer stable employment when one month could have tripled the demand of
586900	592400	another, so the tourism industry provides a great source of casual, seasonal, low-paid
592400	596680	employment, but it's much tougher to make a true career in the industry.
596680	601780	In all, employment is good, but higher quality employment is better.
601780	606980	Of course, in addition, what most people go to Iceland to see is its natural beauty.
606980	612460	That is its strategic asset, but the big conundrum with nature tourism is that use of nature
612460	614220	deteriorates nature.
614220	619140	Of course, you want to allow people to experience nature, but you can only let so many people
619140	623260	see nature before it becomes not all that natural.
623260	628100	More people require more roads, more parking lots, more paths, soon enough it starts to
628100	633220	look like an amusement park, and conversations about nature conservation start to arise.
633220	636660	Then there are problems with an impact on national culture, a housing crunch due to
636660	641180	the rise of rentals, implications on currency due to heavy conversion demand from abroad,
641180	645320	and just the simple effect of having so many people visit what was previously such a quiet
645320	646460	country.
646460	650540	Over-tourism has become a serious concern for Iceland.
650540	655880	Regulations in infrastructure simply have not been able to keep up with the increased demand.
655880	660480	Of course, one final issue with the tourism industry is that it is fickle.
660480	665040	Today's trends will be tomorrow's memory and just as soon as the tourism industry can
665040	666920	explode, it can implode.
666920	670760	If the recipe for success changes, so does the result.
670760	677080	In 2017, one-third of all passengers flying to, from, or through Keflavik Airport, Iceland's
677080	681040	largest, flew on Wow Air—Iceland's number two airline.
681040	686880	Unfortunately though, Wow never reached financial profitability, ran out of financial runway,
686880	687880	and collapsed.
687880	692420	Overnight, the airline funneling hordes of paying tourists into the Icelandic economy
692420	693880	ceased to exist.
693880	699820	Now, Wow Air was not a large airline—in its final days it only had ten planes—but
699820	704400	to a country as small as Iceland, those ten planes made a difference.
704400	710280	The Icelandic economy was estimated, by the Icelandic Central Bank, to grow 1.8% in 2019
710280	715280	but since Wow Air's collapse, that figure has been revised to estimate a shrinkage of
715280	717340	0.4%.
717340	723160	The year was also supposed to end with unemployment of 3.1% but now that figure is estimated to
723160	725400	be 3.9%.
725400	730400	Perhaps more worryingly, though, 2018 ended with something Iceland had not seen in quite
730400	734260	a while on its visitor statistics—a negative.
734260	740240	The number of visitors to Icelandic airports in December 2018 shrunk by a percent relative
740240	744900	to December 2017, and that was before Wow Air's collapse.
744900	757700	And then, January came—down 6.6%, February—down 6%, March—down 13.1%, and April—down 26.4%
757700	760260	compared to the April before.
760260	766080	The Icelandic economy is once again changing as its unstoppable tourist invasion is coming
766080	767860	to a stop.
767860	772340	Now, nobody's entirely sure what's causing this drop.
772340	776640	Just like with the initial uptick, one can only make an educated guess on why thousands
776640	780260	or millions of people are changing their travel preferences.
780260	784620	Maybe it's that Iceland is getting too expensive, maybe it's that Iceland fell out of fashion,
784620	788100	or maybe they're somewhere else taking Iceland's tourism dollars.
788100	791280	What sure is that it's not all because of Wow Air's collapse.
791280	794020	That certainly didn't help, but this is a bigger trend.
794020	797820	But this slowdown is not all entirely bad news.
797820	799900	This gives the country time to catch up.
799900	804620	It had a bit of a Wild West period of tourism during the explosion, but it can now collect
804620	809780	itself and figure out how to turn this trend into an industry that can translate to long-term,
809780	812020	stable economic success.
812020	815620	Thanks to Iceland's small size, its economy is small and nimble.
815620	819160	They've proven in the past that they can completely reinvent themselves even within
819160	824780	a decade, and perhaps this is just the start of revolution number three.
824780	830100	Now, in the 2000s, when Iceland's finance industry was so strong, one of the things
830100	834360	that a lot of Icelanders would have learned is quantitative finance.
834360	838240	This is the sort of math used to model how the financial markets work and it's quite
838240	842640	useful to know if you want to get into stock trading or other fields of finance.
