00:09.760 --> 00:16.000
Fifty years ago, Iceland was an afterthought—a small, barren, insignificant island in the

00:16.000 --> 00:17.200
North Atlantic.

00:17.200 --> 00:21.280
It had little money, little power, and a tiny population.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.120
Its economy was primarily dependent on fishing.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.480
The country sits in an area with plentiful supplies of desirable species of fish and

00:28.480 --> 00:32.640
the capture and processing of this resource proved a stable source of employment for the

00:32.640 --> 00:37.000
country's small population, but it was not a sector that could push the country onto

00:37.000 --> 00:38.120
the world stage.

00:38.120 --> 00:43.080
Iceland's economy had little blips of growth throughout the 80s and 90s, but none permanent

00:43.080 --> 00:48.320
or significant, but then, in the 90s, economic reform occurred.

00:48.320 --> 00:52.840
Taxes were slashed, state-owned enterprises were privatized, and slow but constant growth

00:52.840 --> 00:53.840
began.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.640
It continued, briefly faltered, and then just exploded.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.800
Private industry took hold of the economy, the financial industry was deregulated, and

01:02.800 --> 01:07.140
Iceland's banks came to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

01:07.140 --> 01:10.640
By 2008, Iceland was the fourth richest country in the world.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.760
It was on top of the world.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.920
Reykjavik became a small but significant financial capital.

01:15.920 --> 01:22.060
It had everything a small country could want—money, power, attention—but then it all just came

01:22.060 --> 01:23.760
crashing down.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.940
The economy imploded.

01:25.940 --> 01:30.360
As the global recession began, trust in Iceland's small banks started to fall and so did the

01:30.360 --> 01:32.240
value of the Icelandic krona.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.840
Customers came to withdraw their savings, and the banks just didn't have the money

01:35.840 --> 01:36.840
to give them.

01:36.840 --> 01:41.880
Iceland's banks dealt with ten times more money than the entire GDP of Iceland, so the

01:41.880 --> 01:43.700
country just couldn't bail them out.

01:43.700 --> 01:47.920
The banks collapsed, and with them, the country's economy did too.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.380
But Iceland had other assets.

01:50.380 --> 01:53.440
One of tourism's biggest barriers is accessibility.

01:53.440 --> 01:58.040
If you can't get to a place, no matter how much you want to go, you won't go.

01:58.040 --> 02:02.280
As an extreme example, almost anyone would probably like to visit the South Pole and

02:02.280 --> 02:07.400
you can visit the South Pole, it just costs tens of thousands of dollars.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.340
If you took a few zeroes off that number, the number of zeroes on the visitor count

02:11.340 --> 02:13.400
would certainly go up.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.640
In Iceland's case, it already had accessibility.

02:16.640 --> 02:23.320
Despite its population of only around 340,000, Iceland has long had a fairly large airline.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.520
Icelandair.

02:24.520 --> 02:29.560
You see, in the 1950s, international airline travel was all heavily regulated with most

02:29.560 --> 02:34.000
prices fixed by IATA so airlines had little ability to compete on price.

02:34.000 --> 02:39.120
While a route like New York to London non-stop would be IATA regulated, a connecting itinerary

02:39.120 --> 02:43.820
from New York to Reykjavik to Luxembourg, on the other hand, would not be IATA regulated

02:43.820 --> 02:48.340
as it was a connecting itinerary so this is what Icelandair flew.

02:48.340 --> 02:53.240
With this, they could undercut other airlines' fares by hundreds of dollars.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.540
Thus, Icelandair became one of the first ever budget airlines and it grew into the

02:57.540 --> 03:02.680
transatlantic airline of choice for students, backpackers, and other travelers on a budget.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.320
Its number of planes and destinations grew and grew and all of these people were flying

03:06.320 --> 03:10.880
through Iceland, but they weren't actually going to Iceland.

03:10.880 --> 03:15.760
By 2005, more than 2 million passengers were flying through Keflavik Airport, Icelandair's

03:15.760 --> 03:21.640
hub, annually despite only 370,000 of those actually visiting Iceland.

03:21.640 --> 03:28.360
Of course, the other asset Iceland has are things people want to see—unspoiled, unbridled,

03:28.360 --> 03:29.360
natural beauty.

03:29.360 --> 03:33.720
It is one of the most spectacular and unique natural environments in the world and it's

03:33.720 --> 03:36.640
only a two-hour flight away from the UK.

03:36.640 --> 03:42.540
Now, there was just one more thing Iceland needed in its tourism recipe—affordability.

03:42.540 --> 03:47.680
With the 2008 financial crisis and banking industry collapse, the Icelandic krona, too,

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
collapsed.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.480
Beginning to end of 2008, its value against the US dollar halved with a similar story

03:53.480 --> 03:54.760
against the euro.

03:54.760 --> 03:59.280
Of course, that meant that those using the dollar and euro, Americans and Europeans,

03:59.280 --> 04:02.080
could buy more for less in Iceland.

04:02.080 --> 04:08.360
So, Iceland had accessibility, it had affordability, it had sights people wanted to see, it had

04:08.360 --> 04:13.440
all the fuel for a tourism explosion, it just needed ignition.

04:13.440 --> 04:18.200
In a way, the very event that collapsed the Icelandic economy initiated the start of its

04:18.200 --> 04:19.580
revitalization.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.040
The Icelandic banking collapse made world headlines and placed Iceland on the map.

04:24.040 --> 04:29.520
Then, in 2010, two years after the economic crash, Iceland made even bigger headlines

04:29.520 --> 04:32.680
with the volcanic eruption of Eyjaflattja jökull.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.980
The ash cloud that ensued drifted over Europe preventing almost all flights from operating

04:36.980 --> 04:39.680
for a period of six and a half days.

04:39.680 --> 04:44.940
All in all, over 100,000 flights were cancelled because of Iceland's ash cloud but because

04:44.940 --> 04:50.120
of that, reporters from all around the world descended on Iceland broadcasting images of

04:50.120 --> 04:53.520
the nation's volcanoes into the homes of millions.

04:53.520 --> 04:57.880
It was free, worldwide advertisement for Iceland's natural beauty.

04:57.880 --> 05:02.180
A few years after that, Iceland became the smallest nation ever to qualify for a major

05:02.180 --> 05:06.880
tournament as its national football team competed in the Euro 2016 tournament.

05:06.880 --> 05:11.240
The team lost but received significant attention for its qualification and then it ultimately

05:11.240 --> 05:14.920
qualified and competed in the 2018 World Cup.

05:14.920 --> 05:20.060
With these three events, Iceland was now known, its tourism industry had ignition, and word

05:20.060 --> 05:21.640
spread fast.

05:21.640 --> 05:27.620
It became the tourism destination of the 2010s, especially for Europeans and Americans.

05:27.620 --> 05:31.800
Iceland hit double-digit tourism growth year over year, year after year.

05:31.800 --> 05:36.120
They had their first year with a million visitors and then only two years after that they had

05:36.120 --> 05:38.560
their first year with two million.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.080
Tourists just would not stop coming.

05:41.080 --> 05:45.280
New hotels opened every month, new rentals opened every day.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.200
Iceland's roads carried a non-stop procession of camper vans.

05:49.200 --> 05:53.240
New routes were opening to Keflavik airport faster than they could build gates.

05:53.240 --> 05:56.320
Icelandair was adding new destinations left and right.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.720
Soon enough, you could get to Iceland non-stop for more than 50 cities worldwide.

06:00.720 --> 06:06.280
A second Icelandic airline, Wow Air, opened up and was soon to fly thousands of people

06:06.280 --> 06:08.700
into Iceland each day.

06:08.700 --> 06:14.640
Iceland had real, considerable GDP growth topping out at over 7% annually—almost unheard

06:14.640 --> 06:16.520
of for a wealthy nation.

06:16.520 --> 06:22.640
Now, taking a step back, worldwide, the tourism industry is absolutely enormous.

06:22.640 --> 06:28.440
$1.6 trillion was spent on international tourism alone in 2017.

06:28.440 --> 06:33.380
Capturing a part of this industry is a viable strategy for economic development.

06:33.380 --> 06:37.880
Some countries grow off manufacturing, some off mining, and some off tourism.

06:37.880 --> 06:42.440
Now, in the past century, there are so many stories of countries that went from nothing

06:42.440 --> 06:45.880
to something in an instant thanks to oil.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.920
All of these countries, though, know that oil is finite and that they need to use the

06:49.920 --> 06:54.720
wealth that oil generates to develop new industries if they want to survive as wealthy nations

06:54.720 --> 06:56.840
in a post-oil economy.

06:56.840 --> 07:01.320
The UAE, for example, is one of the better diversified oil economies.

07:01.320 --> 07:06.240
Oil revenues have gone from accounting for 90% of the country's GDP in the 70s to around

07:06.240 --> 07:07.240
25% today.

07:07.240 --> 07:12.280
A lot of this growth in non-oil industries came from an aggressive pursuit of foreign

07:12.280 --> 07:16.480
direct investment to become the definitive business hub for the Middle East, but an industry

07:16.480 --> 07:19.600
that played no small part is that of tourism.

07:19.600 --> 07:24.980
21 million people visited the UAE in 2018—quite impressive for a country physically smaller

07:24.980 --> 07:30.380
than Iceland, and even more impressive considering that the number was only 12 million in 2012.

07:30.380 --> 07:34.780
As a country with fewer natural tourism assets than Iceland, the UAE government has put a

07:34.780 --> 07:39.500
lot of focus into crafting Dubai into the entertainment capital of the Middle East to

07:39.500 --> 07:41.140
draw these tourists in.

07:41.140 --> 07:46.700
As a result of these efforts, economically, the UAE has gone from nothing to an unstable,

07:46.700 --> 07:51.220
oil-based something to a diversified something that will likely survive a future without

07:51.220 --> 07:52.340
oil.

07:52.340 --> 07:56.860
Other nearby oil-dependent economies are paying attention to the UAE's path.

07:56.860 --> 08:01.900
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman have all each also indicated their intention to

08:01.900 --> 08:06.220
grow tourism to be a sizable element of their post-oil economies.

08:06.220 --> 08:10.400
This is part of the reason, mimicking Emirates and the UAE, that these neighbors have devoted

08:10.400 --> 08:15.500
vast sums of money into developing and improving their state-owned airlines—Saudia, Gulf

08:15.500 --> 08:18.660
Air, Qatar Airways, and Oman Air.

08:18.660 --> 08:22.620
Being the story of Iceland even further, Qatar has already established itself as a

08:22.620 --> 08:27.140
major connecting airline hub thanks to its advantageous geographic position and is using

08:27.140 --> 08:31.700
this to introduce more and more people to the country itself in the lead up to the 2022

08:31.700 --> 08:33.240
Qatar World Cup.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.300
But tourism has its limitations.

08:35.300 --> 08:40.540
It can do a great job of pushing up those indicators, but not all economic growth is

08:40.540 --> 08:42.060
created equal.

08:42.060 --> 08:47.460
For one, tourism is a service industry and these jobs are low wage.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.980
Clearly, most people who are working as banking executives in Iceland's collapsed finance

08:51.980 --> 08:55.540
industry are not going to start working in hotels.

08:55.540 --> 09:00.940
As such a high wage country, Icelanders are just a bit too expensive for many of the jobs

09:00.940 --> 09:02.520
in the tourism industry.

09:02.520 --> 09:08.140
As a result, Iceland opened its borders slightly and 32% of those now working in its tourism

09:08.140 --> 09:11.940
industry are foreigners—many from lower wage countries.

09:11.940 --> 09:19.220
Tellingly, 37% of staff in Icelandic hotels are Polish while only 24% are Icelandic.

09:19.220 --> 09:23.820
Of course, Iceland has absolutely no problem with unemployment right now, which is mostly

09:23.820 --> 09:29.180
a good thing, but the labor that's in demand is low paid with limited upward potential.

09:29.180 --> 09:32.280
Nobody's making their millions manning front desks.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.780
In addition, the tourism industry is highly seasonal.

09:35.780 --> 09:42.580
Given Iceland in 2017, just 13.6% of total visits happened in the entire season of spring.

09:42.580 --> 09:46.900
It's hard to offer stable employment when one month could have tripled the demand of

09:46.900 --> 09:52.400
another, so the tourism industry provides a great source of casual, seasonal, low-paid

09:52.400 --> 09:56.680
employment, but it's much tougher to make a true career in the industry.

09:56.680 --> 10:01.780
In all, employment is good, but higher quality employment is better.

10:01.780 --> 10:06.980
Of course, in addition, what most people go to Iceland to see is its natural beauty.

10:06.980 --> 10:12.460
That is its strategic asset, but the big conundrum with nature tourism is that use of nature

10:12.460 --> 10:14.220
deteriorates nature.

10:14.220 --> 10:19.140
Of course, you want to allow people to experience nature, but you can only let so many people

10:19.140 --> 10:23.260
see nature before it becomes not all that natural.

10:23.260 --> 10:28.100
More people require more roads, more parking lots, more paths, soon enough it starts to

10:28.100 --> 10:33.220
look like an amusement park, and conversations about nature conservation start to arise.

10:33.220 --> 10:36.660
Then there are problems with an impact on national culture, a housing crunch due to

10:36.660 --> 10:41.180
the rise of rentals, implications on currency due to heavy conversion demand from abroad,

10:41.180 --> 10:45.320
and just the simple effect of having so many people visit what was previously such a quiet

10:45.320 --> 10:46.460
country.

10:46.460 --> 10:50.540
Over-tourism has become a serious concern for Iceland.

10:50.540 --> 10:55.880
Regulations in infrastructure simply have not been able to keep up with the increased demand.

10:55.880 --> 11:00.480
Of course, one final issue with the tourism industry is that it is fickle.

11:00.480 --> 11:05.040
Today's trends will be tomorrow's memory and just as soon as the tourism industry can

11:05.040 --> 11:06.920
explode, it can implode.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.760
If the recipe for success changes, so does the result.

11:10.760 --> 11:17.080
In 2017, one-third of all passengers flying to, from, or through Keflavik Airport, Iceland's

11:17.080 --> 11:21.040
largest, flew on Wow Air—Iceland's number two airline.

11:21.040 --> 11:26.880
Unfortunately though, Wow never reached financial profitability, ran out of financial runway,

11:26.880 --> 11:27.880
and collapsed.

11:27.880 --> 11:32.420
Overnight, the airline funneling hordes of paying tourists into the Icelandic economy

11:32.420 --> 11:33.880
ceased to exist.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.820
Now, Wow Air was not a large airline—in its final days it only had ten planes—but

11:39.820 --> 11:44.400
to a country as small as Iceland, those ten planes made a difference.

11:44.400 --> 11:50.280
The Icelandic economy was estimated, by the Icelandic Central Bank, to grow 1.8% in 2019

11:50.280 --> 11:55.280
but since Wow Air's collapse, that figure has been revised to estimate a shrinkage of

11:55.280 --> 11:57.340
0.4%.

11:57.340 --> 12:03.160
The year was also supposed to end with unemployment of 3.1% but now that figure is estimated to

12:03.160 --> 12:05.400
be 3.9%.

12:05.400 --> 12:10.400
Perhaps more worryingly, though, 2018 ended with something Iceland had not seen in quite

12:10.400 --> 12:14.260
a while on its visitor statistics—a negative.

12:14.260 --> 12:20.240
The number of visitors to Icelandic airports in December 2018 shrunk by a percent relative

12:20.240 --> 12:24.900
to December 2017, and that was before Wow Air's collapse.

12:24.900 --> 12:37.700
And then, January came—down 6.6%, February—down 6%, March—down 13.1%, and April—down 26.4%

12:37.700 --> 12:40.260
compared to the April before.

12:40.260 --> 12:46.080
The Icelandic economy is once again changing as its unstoppable tourist invasion is coming

12:46.080 --> 12:47.860
to a stop.

12:47.860 --> 12:52.340
Now, nobody's entirely sure what's causing this drop.

12:52.340 --> 12:56.640
Just like with the initial uptick, one can only make an educated guess on why thousands

12:56.640 --> 13:00.260
or millions of people are changing their travel preferences.

13:00.260 --> 13:04.620
Maybe it's that Iceland is getting too expensive, maybe it's that Iceland fell out of fashion,

13:04.620 --> 13:08.100
or maybe they're somewhere else taking Iceland's tourism dollars.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.280
What sure is that it's not all because of Wow Air's collapse.

13:11.280 --> 13:14.020
That certainly didn't help, but this is a bigger trend.

13:14.020 --> 13:17.820
But this slowdown is not all entirely bad news.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.900
This gives the country time to catch up.

13:19.900 --> 13:24.620
It had a bit of a Wild West period of tourism during the explosion, but it can now collect

13:24.620 --> 13:29.780
itself and figure out how to turn this trend into an industry that can translate to long-term,

13:29.780 --> 13:32.020
stable economic success.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.620
Thanks to Iceland's small size, its economy is small and nimble.

13:35.620 --> 13:39.160
They've proven in the past that they can completely reinvent themselves even within

13:39.160 --> 13:44.780
a decade, and perhaps this is just the start of revolution number three.

13:44.780 --> 13:50.100
Now, in the 2000s, when Iceland's finance industry was so strong, one of the things

13:50.100 --> 13:54.360
that a lot of Icelanders would have learned is quantitative finance.

13:54.360 --> 13:58.240
This is the sort of math used to model how the financial markets work and it's quite

13:58.240 --> 14:02.640
