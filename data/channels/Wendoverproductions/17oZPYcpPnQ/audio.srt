4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,000
Fifty years ago, Iceland was an afterthought—a small, barren, insignificant island in the

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,200
North Atlantic.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,280
It had little money, little power, and a tiny population.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,120
Its economy was primarily dependent on fishing.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,480
The country sits in an area with plentiful supplies of desirable species of fish and

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,640
the capture and processing of this resource proved a stable source of employment for the

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,000
country's small population, but it was not a sector that could push the country onto

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,120
the world stage.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,080
Iceland's economy had little blips of growth throughout the 80s and 90s, but none permanent

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:48,320
or significant, but then, in the 90s, economic reform occurred.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,840
Taxes were slashed, state-owned enterprises were privatized, and slow but constant growth

15
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,840
began.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
It continued, briefly faltered, and then just exploded.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,800
Private industry took hold of the economy, the financial industry was deregulated, and

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,140
Iceland's banks came to hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,640
By 2008, Iceland was the fourth richest country in the world.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,760
It was on top of the world.

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,920
Reykjavik became a small but significant financial capital.

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,060
It had everything a small country could want—money, power, attention—but then it all just came

23
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,760
crashing down.

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,940
The economy imploded.

25
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,360
As the global recession began, trust in Iceland's small banks started to fall and so did the

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,240
value of the Icelandic krona.

27
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,840
Customers came to withdraw their savings, and the banks just didn't have the money

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
to give them.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Iceland's banks dealt with ten times more money than the entire GDP of Iceland, so the

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,700
country just couldn't bail them out.

31
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,920
The banks collapsed, and with them, the country's economy did too.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,380
But Iceland had other assets.

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,440
One of tourism's biggest barriers is accessibility.

34
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,040
If you can't get to a place, no matter how much you want to go, you won't go.

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,280
As an extreme example, almost anyone would probably like to visit the South Pole and

36
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,400
you can visit the South Pole, it just costs tens of thousands of dollars.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,340
If you took a few zeroes off that number, the number of zeroes on the visitor count

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,400
would certainly go up.

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,640
In Iceland's case, it already had accessibility.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,320
Despite its population of only around 340,000, Iceland has long had a fairly large airline.

41
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,520
Icelandair.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,560
You see, in the 1950s, international airline travel was all heavily regulated with most

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,000
prices fixed by IATA so airlines had little ability to compete on price.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,120
While a route like New York to London non-stop would be IATA regulated, a connecting itinerary

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,820
from New York to Reykjavik to Luxembourg, on the other hand, would not be IATA regulated

46
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:48,340
as it was a connecting itinerary so this is what Icelandair flew.

47
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,240
With this, they could undercut other airlines' fares by hundreds of dollars.

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,540
Thus, Icelandair became one of the first ever budget airlines and it grew into the

49
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,680
transatlantic airline of choice for students, backpackers, and other travelers on a budget.

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,320
Its number of planes and destinations grew and grew and all of these people were flying

51
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,880
through Iceland, but they weren't actually going to Iceland.

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,760
By 2005, more than 2 million passengers were flying through Keflavik Airport, Icelandair's

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,640
hub, annually despite only 370,000 of those actually visiting Iceland.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,360
Of course, the other asset Iceland has are things people want to see—unspoiled, unbridled,

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
natural beauty.

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,720
It is one of the most spectacular and unique natural environments in the world and it's

57
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,640
only a two-hour flight away from the UK.

58
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,540
Now, there was just one more thing Iceland needed in its tourism recipe—affordability.

59
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,680
With the 2008 financial crisis and banking industry collapse, the Icelandic krona, too,

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
collapsed.

61
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,480
Beginning to end of 2008, its value against the US dollar halved with a similar story

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
against the euro.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,280
Of course, that meant that those using the dollar and euro, Americans and Europeans,

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,080
could buy more for less in Iceland.

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,360
So, Iceland had accessibility, it had affordability, it had sights people wanted to see, it had

66
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,440
all the fuel for a tourism explosion, it just needed ignition.

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,200
In a way, the very event that collapsed the Icelandic economy initiated the start of its

68
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,580
revitalization.

69
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,040
The Icelandic banking collapse made world headlines and placed Iceland on the map.

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,520
Then, in 2010, two years after the economic crash, Iceland made even bigger headlines

71
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,680
with the volcanic eruption of Eyjaflattja jökull.

72
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,980
The ash cloud that ensued drifted over Europe preventing almost all flights from operating

73
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,680
for a period of six and a half days.

74
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,940
All in all, over 100,000 flights were cancelled because of Iceland's ash cloud but because

75
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,120
of that, reporters from all around the world descended on Iceland broadcasting images of

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,520
the nation's volcanoes into the homes of millions.

77
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,880
It was free, worldwide advertisement for Iceland's natural beauty.

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,180
A few years after that, Iceland became the smallest nation ever to qualify for a major

79
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:06,880
tournament as its national football team competed in the Euro 2016 tournament.

80
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,240
The team lost but received significant attention for its qualification and then it ultimately

81
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,920
qualified and competed in the 2018 World Cup.

82
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,060
With these three events, Iceland was now known, its tourism industry had ignition, and word

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,640
spread fast.

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,620
It became the tourism destination of the 2010s, especially for Europeans and Americans.

85
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,800
Iceland hit double-digit tourism growth year over year, year after year.

86
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,120
They had their first year with a million visitors and then only two years after that they had

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,560
their first year with two million.

88
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,080
Tourists just would not stop coming.

89
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,280
New hotels opened every month, new rentals opened every day.

90
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,200
Iceland's roads carried a non-stop procession of camper vans.

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,240
New routes were opening to Keflavik airport faster than they could build gates.

92
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,320
Icelandair was adding new destinations left and right.

93
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,720
Soon enough, you could get to Iceland non-stop for more than 50 cities worldwide.

94
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,280
A second Icelandic airline, Wow Air, opened up and was soon to fly thousands of people

95
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,700
into Iceland each day.

96
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:14,640
Iceland had real, considerable GDP growth topping out at over 7% annually—almost unheard

97
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,520
of for a wealthy nation.

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,640
Now, taking a step back, worldwide, the tourism industry is absolutely enormous.

99
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,440
$1.6 trillion was spent on international tourism alone in 2017.

100
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,380
Capturing a part of this industry is a viable strategy for economic development.

101
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,880
Some countries grow off manufacturing, some off mining, and some off tourism.

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,440
Now, in the past century, there are so many stories of countries that went from nothing

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,880
to something in an instant thanks to oil.

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,920
All of these countries, though, know that oil is finite and that they need to use the

105
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,720
wealth that oil generates to develop new industries if they want to survive as wealthy nations

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,840
in a post-oil economy.

107
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,320
The UAE, for example, is one of the better diversified oil economies.

108
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,240
Oil revenues have gone from accounting for 90% of the country's GDP in the 70s to around

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
25% today.

110
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,280
A lot of this growth in non-oil industries came from an aggressive pursuit of foreign

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,480
direct investment to become the definitive business hub for the Middle East, but an industry

112
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,600
that played no small part is that of tourism.

113
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,980
21 million people visited the UAE in 2018—quite impressive for a country physically smaller

114
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,380
than Iceland, and even more impressive considering that the number was only 12 million in 2012.

115
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,780
As a country with fewer natural tourism assets than Iceland, the UAE government has put a

116
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,500
lot of focus into crafting Dubai into the entertainment capital of the Middle East to

117
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,140
draw these tourists in.

118
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,700
As a result of these efforts, economically, the UAE has gone from nothing to an unstable,

119
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,220
oil-based something to a diversified something that will likely survive a future without

120
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,340
oil.

121
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:56,860
Other nearby oil-dependent economies are paying attention to the UAE's path.

122
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,900
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman have all each also indicated their intention to

123
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,220
grow tourism to be a sizable element of their post-oil economies.

124
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,400
This is part of the reason, mimicking Emirates and the UAE, that these neighbors have devoted

125
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,500
vast sums of money into developing and improving their state-owned airlines—Saudia, Gulf

126
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,660
Air, Qatar Airways, and Oman Air.

127
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,620
Being the story of Iceland even further, Qatar has already established itself as a

128
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,140
major connecting airline hub thanks to its advantageous geographic position and is using

129
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,700
this to introduce more and more people to the country itself in the lead up to the 2022

130
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,240
Qatar World Cup.

131
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,300
But tourism has its limitations.

132
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,540
It can do a great job of pushing up those indicators, but not all economic growth is

133
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,060
created equal.

134
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,460
For one, tourism is a service industry and these jobs are low wage.

135
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,980
Clearly, most people who are working as banking executives in Iceland's collapsed finance

136
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,540
industry are not going to start working in hotels.

137
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,940
As such a high wage country, Icelanders are just a bit too expensive for many of the jobs

138
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,520
in the tourism industry.

139
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,140
As a result, Iceland opened its borders slightly and 32% of those now working in its tourism

140
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,940
industry are foreigners—many from lower wage countries.

141
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,220
Tellingly, 37% of staff in Icelandic hotels are Polish while only 24% are Icelandic.

142
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,820
Of course, Iceland has absolutely no problem with unemployment right now, which is mostly

143
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:29,180
a good thing, but the labor that's in demand is low paid with limited upward potential.

144
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,280
Nobody's making their millions manning front desks.

145
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,780
In addition, the tourism industry is highly seasonal.

146
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:42,580
Given Iceland in 2017, just 13.6% of total visits happened in the entire season of spring.

147
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,900
It's hard to offer stable employment when one month could have tripled the demand of

148
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:52,400
another, so the tourism industry provides a great source of casual, seasonal, low-paid

149
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,680
employment, but it's much tougher to make a true career in the industry.

150
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,780
In all, employment is good, but higher quality employment is better.

151
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,980
Of course, in addition, what most people go to Iceland to see is its natural beauty.

152
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,460
That is its strategic asset, but the big conundrum with nature tourism is that use of nature

153
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,220
deteriorates nature.

154
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:19,140
Of course, you want to allow people to experience nature, but you can only let so many people

155
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,260
see nature before it becomes not all that natural.

156
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:28,100
More people require more roads, more parking lots, more paths, soon enough it starts to

157
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,220
look like an amusement park, and conversations about nature conservation start to arise.

158
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,660
Then there are problems with an impact on national culture, a housing crunch due to

159
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,180
the rise of rentals, implications on currency due to heavy conversion demand from abroad,

160
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,320
and just the simple effect of having so many people visit what was previously such a quiet

161
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,460
country.

162
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,540
Over-tourism has become a serious concern for Iceland.

163
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,880
Regulations in infrastructure simply have not been able to keep up with the increased demand.

164
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Of course, one final issue with the tourism industry is that it is fickle.

165
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,040
Today's trends will be tomorrow's memory and just as soon as the tourism industry can

166
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,920
explode, it can implode.

167
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,760
If the recipe for success changes, so does the result.

168
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,080
In 2017, one-third of all passengers flying to, from, or through Keflavik Airport, Iceland's

169
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,040
largest, flew on Wow Air—Iceland's number two airline.

170
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,880
Unfortunately though, Wow never reached financial profitability, ran out of financial runway,

171
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
and collapsed.

172
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,420
Overnight, the airline funneling hordes of paying tourists into the Icelandic economy

173
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,880
ceased to exist.

174
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,820
Now, Wow Air was not a large airline—in its final days it only had ten planes—but

175
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,400
to a country as small as Iceland, those ten planes made a difference.

176
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,280
The Icelandic economy was estimated, by the Icelandic Central Bank, to grow 1.8% in 2019

177
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,280
but since Wow Air's collapse, that figure has been revised to estimate a shrinkage of

178
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,340
0.4%.

179
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,160
The year was also supposed to end with unemployment of 3.1% but now that figure is estimated to

180
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,400
be 3.9%.

181
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Perhaps more worryingly, though, 2018 ended with something Iceland had not seen in quite

182
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,260
a while on its visitor statistics—a negative.

183
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,240
The number of visitors to Icelandic airports in December 2018 shrunk by a percent relative

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,900
to December 2017, and that was before Wow Air's collapse.

185
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:37,700
And then, January came—down 6.6%, February—down 6%, March—down 13.1%, and April—down 26.4%

186
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,260
compared to the April before.

187
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:46,080
The Icelandic economy is once again changing as its unstoppable tourist invasion is coming

188
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,860
to a stop.

189
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:52,340
Now, nobody's entirely sure what's causing this drop.

190
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,640
Just like with the initial uptick, one can only make an educated guess on why thousands

191
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,260
or millions of people are changing their travel preferences.

192
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,620
Maybe it's that Iceland is getting too expensive, maybe it's that Iceland fell out of fashion,

193
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,100
or maybe they're somewhere else taking Iceland's tourism dollars.

194
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,280
What sure is that it's not all because of Wow Air's collapse.

195
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,020
That certainly didn't help, but this is a bigger trend.

196
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,820
But this slowdown is not all entirely bad news.

197
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,900
This gives the country time to catch up.

198
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,620
It had a bit of a Wild West period of tourism during the explosion, but it can now collect

199
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,780
itself and figure out how to turn this trend into an industry that can translate to long-term,

200
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,020
stable economic success.

201
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,620
Thanks to Iceland's small size, its economy is small and nimble.

202
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,160
They've proven in the past that they can completely reinvent themselves even within

203
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,780
a decade, and perhaps this is just the start of revolution number three.

204
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:50,100
Now, in the 2000s, when Iceland's finance industry was so strong, one of the things

205
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,360
that a lot of Icelanders would have learned is quantitative finance.

206
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,240
This is the sort of math used to model how the financial markets work and it's quite

207
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,640
useful to know if you want to get into stock trading or other fields of finance.

208
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,580
Brilliant has a fantastic math for quantitative finance course which teaches the complex topics
