00:10.480 --> 00:15.760
This is East Asia, comprised of China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and this is Europe.

00:15.760 --> 00:21.200
2.4 billion people live in these two areas—a third of the world's population.

00:21.200 --> 00:26.720
More impressively, each of these two areas have a GDP of around $20 trillion.

00:26.720 --> 00:32.360
Combined, just these countries account for half of the world's economic activity.

00:32.360 --> 00:37.080
They are two of the world's most dense, most developed, and most economically interlinked

00:37.080 --> 00:42.000
regions and are home to the world's largest and most influential cities yet laying between

00:42.000 --> 00:45.440
them is just one country—Russia.

00:45.440 --> 00:50.140
This more or less means that one country controls whether Europe can get to Asia and vice versa

00:50.140 --> 00:52.780
and for a while, they couldn't.

00:52.780 --> 00:57.040
During the cold war, almost universally, non-Soviet airlines were not allowed to fly

00:57.040 --> 00:58.820
over the Soviet Union.

00:58.820 --> 01:01.420
This proved a huge barrier to travel.

01:01.420 --> 01:06.260
In the 1950s, flying on BOAC, which later became British Airways, the fastest route

01:06.260 --> 01:12.500
from London to Tokyo involved leaving London at 10 AM on Friday and stopping in Rome, Beirut,

01:12.500 --> 01:19.340
Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Yangon, Bangkok, and Manila before finally arriving in Tokyo

01:19.340 --> 01:21.580
at 6 AM on a Sunday.

01:21.580 --> 01:27.820
All in all, that was 36 hours and 10,000 miles of travel to get between two cities 6,000

01:27.820 --> 01:32.460
miles apart and that was also their fastest service on the Comet jet plane.

01:32.460 --> 01:36.620
Their slower and cheaper propeller service would leave London on a Sunday and not arrive

01:36.620 --> 01:41.300
in Tokyo until Thursday after 88 hours of travel.

01:41.300 --> 01:46.900
It was just hugely inefficient but there was a better way—over the Arctic.

01:46.900 --> 01:52.380
SAS was the first to develop routes overflying the Arctic but other airlines soon followed.

01:52.380 --> 01:56.300
These routes were first used to get to the American west coast faster.

01:56.300 --> 02:00.900
This involved developing new navigation systems to overcome the issue of traditional magnetic

02:00.900 --> 02:03.660
compasses not working properly in the high north.

02:03.660 --> 02:08.860
In the 1950s, no commercial airplane had the range to fly to the American west coast non-stop

02:08.860 --> 02:13.340
but with SAS' new polar route, they would take a relatively quick route from Copenhagen

02:13.340 --> 02:18.600
stopping in Kangerlussuaar, Greenland, and Winnipeg, Canada before arriving in Los Angeles.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.600
This cut what was previously a 36 hour trip down to 22.

02:22.600 --> 02:26.880
With SAS having proven that commercial flights over the Arctic were both safe and commercially

02:26.880 --> 02:31.180
viable, other airlines quickly followed not only setting up routes to the American west

02:31.180 --> 02:33.900
coast but also to the far east.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.220
The most direct route from London to Tokyo flies over Siberia but since that airspace

02:38.220 --> 02:43.100
was closed airlines chose another way—the other way around the world.

02:43.100 --> 02:48.420
In the 1960s, only 40,000 people lived in Anchorage, Alaska and Alaska had just become

02:48.420 --> 02:53.780
a state the year before but its airport emerged as a crucial stopping point between Europe

02:53.780 --> 02:54.780
and Asia.

02:54.780 --> 03:00.720
BOAC's thrice weekly polar route from London to Tokyo would leave Heathrow at 1.45 pm,

03:00.720 --> 03:04.600
arrive in Anchorage nine and a half hours later, stop for an hour to refuel, and then

03:04.600 --> 03:07.100
fly the remaining seven hours to Tokyo.

03:07.100 --> 03:12.340
All in all, it was timetable to take only 17 and a half hours—half of what the trip

03:12.340 --> 03:13.340
took before.

03:13.340 --> 03:17.940
It was as drastic a reduction in travel time as when Concord cut New York to London flights

03:17.940 --> 03:19.820
from six hours to three.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.860
BOAC wasn't the only one.

03:21.860 --> 03:26.340
All the major European carriers set up routes to the far east via Anchorage in the 1960s

03:26.340 --> 03:27.340
and 70s.

03:27.340 --> 03:31.860
While Anchorage sees only a few dozen daily commercial flights mostly to the continental

03:31.860 --> 03:38.900
US today, in the 1970s it was served by Air France, SAS, KLM, Iberia, Lufthansa, Japan

03:38.900 --> 03:41.200
Airlines, Korean Air, and more.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.100
This tiny town in Alaska quickly became one of the most connected and cosmopolitan areas

03:46.100 --> 03:50.780
of the world with passengers and flight crews from all around the world stopping over all

03:50.780 --> 03:53.100
because of where it was.

03:53.100 --> 03:57.180
As aircraft became more advanced with longer range, there were a few airlines that managed

03:57.180 --> 04:00.700
to avoid stopping in Anchorage on their way from Europe to East Asia.

04:00.700 --> 04:06.200
Thin Air, for example, started flying from Helsinki to Tokyo non-stop in 1983 by flying

04:06.200 --> 04:09.980
in international airspace north of Russia over the North Pole.

04:09.980 --> 04:15.040
This made what is today a nine-hour flight 13 hours but it was still faster than stopping

04:15.040 --> 04:16.080
in Anchorage.

04:16.080 --> 04:19.940
Overwhelmingly though, airlines continued to fly through Anchorage.

04:19.940 --> 04:24.640
Eventually though, the Soviet Union did of course fall in 1991 and with that Russia started

04:24.640 --> 04:28.460
to grant overflight rights to European and East Asian airlines.

04:28.460 --> 04:32.660
They first had to modernize and anglicize their air traffic control system.

04:32.660 --> 04:37.340
All international pilots and air traffic controllers worldwide speak English but before, since

04:37.340 --> 04:41.420
there were few international flights over Russia, the Russian air traffic controllers

04:41.420 --> 04:42.740
didn't speak English.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.580
Once the changes were made, airlines quickly switched to flying non-stop from Europe to

04:46.580 --> 04:48.540
Asia over Siberia.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.160
That left Anchorage largely deserted.

04:51.160 --> 04:56.080
The airport built a large and modern international terminal in 1982 to handle all the traffic

04:56.080 --> 05:00.840
passing through the airport but then, less than 10 years later, all those airlines that

05:00.840 --> 05:03.600
kept the airport busy left in droves.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.440
Today, that international terminal, built to handle hundreds of flights per month, only

05:08.440 --> 05:10.600
sees a flight every few days.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.440
Russia, meanwhile, is prospering thanks to the opening up of its airspace.

05:15.440 --> 05:20.460
Flying to Asia over Siberia saves airlines huge amounts of time and money so Russia therefore

05:20.460 --> 05:23.720
charges airlines huge amounts of money to do so.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.020
Flight numbers vary by airline and are kept secret but for each round-trip flight between

05:28.020 --> 05:33.760
Europe and Asia, Siberian overflight fees are believed to account for up to $100 of

05:33.760 --> 05:36.380
a single passenger's ticket price.

05:36.380 --> 05:41.080
Russia has an enormous amount of power by controlling this airspace and they use it

05:41.080 --> 05:42.280
to their advantage.

05:42.280 --> 05:47.360
133 countries have signed the International Civil Aviation Organization's Transit Agreement

05:47.360 --> 05:51.320
which essentially allows any airline from any country to fly through the signatory's

05:51.320 --> 05:56.200
airspace but Russia, however, has not so they can pick and choose which countries airlines

05:56.200 --> 05:58.160
get to fly through their airspace.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.200
The country can and has used its airspace as a geopolitical weapon.

06:02.200 --> 06:06.460
In 2014 they threatened to shut down their airspace to European Union Airlines in response

06:06.460 --> 06:11.120
to sanctions, in 2017 they threatened to close their airspace to Dutch Airlines in response

06:11.120 --> 06:15.680
to a reduction in landing slots for a Russian airline at Schiphol airport, and in April

06:15.680 --> 06:20.240
2018 they tacitly threatened to close their airspace to US airlines in response to US

06:21.240 --> 06:22.240
military action in Syria.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.000
But Russia not only decides which countries can fly in its airspace, it also decides which

06:27.000 --> 06:28.880
specific airlines.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.800
There is more or less a rule that only one airline per European country can overfly Russia.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.960
There are certainly exceptions, both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are London based

06:37.960 --> 06:42.720
for example but both overfly Siberia on their routes to Shanghai and Hong Kong but Air France

06:42.720 --> 06:47.160
is the only French airline with Siberian overflight rights, Lufthansa is the only German airline

06:47.160 --> 06:51.360
with overflight rights, Iberia is the only Spanish airline with overflight rights, and

06:51.360 --> 06:53.100
so on and so forth.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.960
For the longest while this wasn't a problem.

06:55.960 --> 07:00.360
European countries aren't that big and few had more than one intercontinental airline

07:00.360 --> 07:02.560
but nowadays, however, that's changing.

07:02.560 --> 07:06.920
We're seeing more and more budget airlines competing with the large, established carriers

07:06.920 --> 07:11.840
on long-haul routes but with this system of overflight permissions, the legacy carriers

07:11.840 --> 07:15.240
more or less have a monopoly on East Asian routes.

07:15.240 --> 07:20.240
SAS, for example, operates out of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden and they have Siberian

07:20.240 --> 07:24.760
overflight rights that take them to destinations like Tokyo, Beijing, and Shanghai.

07:24.760 --> 07:29.880
SAS is therefore the only Scandinavian airline allowed to overfly Siberia.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.600
But also in Scandinavia is Norwegian Air.

07:32.600 --> 07:37.200
As one of the largest low-cost airlines in the world, Norwegian has pioneered long-haul

07:37.200 --> 07:42.040
budget flying, mainly focusing on flights from major European cities to the US.

07:42.040 --> 07:45.920
The airline has said, though, that it wants to expand eastwards.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.940
They already have flights from Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm to Bangkok and from London

07:49.940 --> 07:54.320
to Singapore but these destinations are far enough south that they don't involve flying

07:54.320 --> 07:55.660
over Siberia.

07:55.660 --> 08:00.900
The airline has repeatedly applied for Siberian overflight rights and repeatedly been denied.

08:00.900 --> 08:05.540
They argue that SAS does not operate any flight from Norway to Asia so they should be granted

08:05.540 --> 08:11.280
permission as the only Norwegian airline but since SAS is partially registered in Norway,

08:11.280 --> 08:13.720
Russia isn't granting permission.

08:13.720 --> 08:18.040
Norwegian does have a subsidiary legally registered in the UK but it's unlikely that Russia

08:18.040 --> 08:22.380
would grant overflight rights to this since British Airways and Virgin Atlantic also have

08:22.380 --> 08:23.920
overflight rights.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.000
Norwegian Airlines also has a subsidiary based in Ireland which does not have an airline

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
with Siberian overflight rights but SAS also has a subsidiary based in the country which

08:33.000 --> 08:36.860
could mean that Russia will deny rights to this subsidiary too.

08:36.860 --> 08:41.680
As of now, Russia has not granted overflight permission to any budget airline.

08:41.680 --> 08:46.240
Others have tried—Icelandic airlines Wow Air and Icelandair have attempted to negotiate

08:46.240 --> 08:50.820
overflight rights but Russia views overflights as a way to make money and wants to charge

08:50.820 --> 08:54.660
fees that would make it impossible for a low-cost airline.

08:54.660 --> 08:59.100
For now, Wow Air has planned to start flights from Reykjavik to Delhi, India which, in

08:59.100 --> 09:03.740
a direct routing, would fly over Russia but can route around Russia by only adding 45

09:03.740 --> 09:07.820
minutes in extra flight time if an arrangement isn't made before flights start in December

09:07.820 --> 09:09.140
2018.

09:09.140 --> 09:13.600
Russia is a powerful, politically savvy country that knows that these overflight rights are

09:13.600 --> 09:15.600
a huge negotiation tool.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.520
Pulling the rights of a country's airline would be a huge financial blow and granting

09:19.520 --> 09:22.140
rights is also a huge advantage.

09:22.140 --> 09:26.780
Competition, though, is good for the consumer and this current system stifles it.

09:26.780 --> 09:31.460
Until Russia starts granting overflight rights to budget airlines, non-stop flights to Asia

09:31.460 --> 09:33.080
will stay expensive.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.460
The fact that this shortcut over Siberia is now open at all, however, saves millions of

09:37.460 --> 09:42.120
passengers yearly enormous amounts of time and money.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.740
Watching this ten minute video of our technological progress might make you think that we got

09:45.740 --> 09:49.440
here in one giant leap but that, of course, is not the case.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.820
We had to develop new navigation systems to work around old-school compasses, build airports

09:53.820 --> 09:56.980
to help planes refuel, and extend the range of aircraft.

09:56.980 --> 10:00.640
The problem of it advancing enough to be able to fly non-stop to the other side of the world

10:00.640 --> 10:04.720
was huge but it was broken down and approached in small steps.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.100
Brilliant works in a similar way—breaking a problem down, identifying the relevant concepts,

10:09.100 --> 10:12.640
thinking clearly through each part, and building it back up to the conclusion.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.480
In this manner, super complex topics like number theory or calculus can be easily understood

10:17.480 --> 10:18.520
by anyone.

10:18.520 --> 10:22.440
My favorite from Brilliant is their logic course which starts simple but then builds

10:22.440 --> 10:26.360
up your skills so you can solve seemingly impossible problems.
