4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,760
This is East Asia, comprised of China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and this is Europe.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,200
2.4 billion people live in these two areas—a third of the world's population.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,720
More impressively, each of these two areas have a GDP of around $20 trillion.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,360
Combined, just these countries account for half of the world's economic activity.

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,080
They are two of the world's most dense, most developed, and most economically interlinked

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,000
regions and are home to the world's largest and most influential cities yet laying between

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,440
them is just one country—Russia.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,140
This more or less means that one country controls whether Europe can get to Asia and vice versa

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,780
and for a while, they couldn't.

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:57,040
During the cold war, almost universally, non-Soviet airlines were not allowed to fly

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,820
over the Soviet Union.

15
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,420
This proved a huge barrier to travel.

16
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,260
In the 1950s, flying on BOAC, which later became British Airways, the fastest route

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,500
from London to Tokyo involved leaving London at 10 AM on Friday and stopping in Rome, Beirut,

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,340
Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Yangon, Bangkok, and Manila before finally arriving in Tokyo

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,580
at 6 AM on a Sunday.

20
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:27,820
All in all, that was 36 hours and 10,000 miles of travel to get between two cities 6,000

21
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,460
miles apart and that was also their fastest service on the Comet jet plane.

22
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,620
Their slower and cheaper propeller service would leave London on a Sunday and not arrive

23
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:41,300
in Tokyo until Thursday after 88 hours of travel.

24
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,900
It was just hugely inefficient but there was a better way—over the Arctic.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:52,380
SAS was the first to develop routes overflying the Arctic but other airlines soon followed.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,300
These routes were first used to get to the American west coast faster.

27
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,900
This involved developing new navigation systems to overcome the issue of traditional magnetic

28
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,660
compasses not working properly in the high north.

29
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,860
In the 1950s, no commercial airplane had the range to fly to the American west coast non-stop

30
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,340
but with SAS' new polar route, they would take a relatively quick route from Copenhagen

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,600
stopping in Kangerlussuaar, Greenland, and Winnipeg, Canada before arriving in Los Angeles.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,600
This cut what was previously a 36 hour trip down to 22.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,880
With SAS having proven that commercial flights over the Arctic were both safe and commercially

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,180
viable, other airlines quickly followed not only setting up routes to the American west

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,900
coast but also to the far east.

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,220
The most direct route from London to Tokyo flies over Siberia but since that airspace

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,100
was closed airlines chose another way—the other way around the world.

38
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,420
In the 1960s, only 40,000 people lived in Anchorage, Alaska and Alaska had just become

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,780
a state the year before but its airport emerged as a crucial stopping point between Europe

40
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
and Asia.

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:00,720
BOAC's thrice weekly polar route from London to Tokyo would leave Heathrow at 1.45 pm,

42
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,600
arrive in Anchorage nine and a half hours later, stop for an hour to refuel, and then

43
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,100
fly the remaining seven hours to Tokyo.

44
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:12,340
All in all, it was timetable to take only 17 and a half hours—half of what the trip

45
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
took before.

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,940
It was as drastic a reduction in travel time as when Concord cut New York to London flights

47
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,820
from six hours to three.

48
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,860
BOAC wasn't the only one.

49
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:26,340
All the major European carriers set up routes to the far east via Anchorage in the 1960s

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
and 70s.

51
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,860
While Anchorage sees only a few dozen daily commercial flights mostly to the continental

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,900
US today, in the 1970s it was served by Air France, SAS, KLM, Iberia, Lufthansa, Japan

53
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,200
Airlines, Korean Air, and more.

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,100
This tiny town in Alaska quickly became one of the most connected and cosmopolitan areas

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,780
of the world with passengers and flight crews from all around the world stopping over all

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,100
because of where it was.

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,180
As aircraft became more advanced with longer range, there were a few airlines that managed

58
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,700
to avoid stopping in Anchorage on their way from Europe to East Asia.

59
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,200
Thin Air, for example, started flying from Helsinki to Tokyo non-stop in 1983 by flying

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,980
in international airspace north of Russia over the North Pole.

61
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,040
This made what is today a nine-hour flight 13 hours but it was still faster than stopping

62
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,080
in Anchorage.

63
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,940
Overwhelmingly though, airlines continued to fly through Anchorage.

64
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,640
Eventually though, the Soviet Union did of course fall in 1991 and with that Russia started

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,460
to grant overflight rights to European and East Asian airlines.

66
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,660
They first had to modernize and anglicize their air traffic control system.

67
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,340
All international pilots and air traffic controllers worldwide speak English but before, since

68
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,420
there were few international flights over Russia, the Russian air traffic controllers

69
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,740
didn't speak English.

70
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,580
Once the changes were made, airlines quickly switched to flying non-stop from Europe to

71
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,540
Asia over Siberia.

72
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,160
That left Anchorage largely deserted.

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,080
The airport built a large and modern international terminal in 1982 to handle all the traffic

74
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,840
passing through the airport but then, less than 10 years later, all those airlines that

75
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,600
kept the airport busy left in droves.

76
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Today, that international terminal, built to handle hundreds of flights per month, only

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,600
sees a flight every few days.

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,440
Russia, meanwhile, is prospering thanks to the opening up of its airspace.

79
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,460
Flying to Asia over Siberia saves airlines huge amounts of time and money so Russia therefore

80
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,720
charges airlines huge amounts of money to do so.

81
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,020
Flight numbers vary by airline and are kept secret but for each round-trip flight between

82
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,760
Europe and Asia, Siberian overflight fees are believed to account for up to $100 of

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,380
a single passenger's ticket price.

84
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:41,080
Russia has an enormous amount of power by controlling this airspace and they use it

85
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,280
to their advantage.

86
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,360
133 countries have signed the International Civil Aviation Organization's Transit Agreement

87
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,320
which essentially allows any airline from any country to fly through the signatory's

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,200
airspace but Russia, however, has not so they can pick and choose which countries airlines

89
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,160
get to fly through their airspace.

90
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,200
The country can and has used its airspace as a geopolitical weapon.

91
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,460
In 2014 they threatened to shut down their airspace to European Union Airlines in response

92
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,120
to sanctions, in 2017 they threatened to close their airspace to Dutch Airlines in response

93
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680
to a reduction in landing slots for a Russian airline at Schiphol airport, and in April

94
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
2018 they tacitly threatened to close their airspace to US airlines in response to US

95
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
military action in Syria.

96
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,000
But Russia not only decides which countries can fly in its airspace, it also decides which

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,880
specific airlines.

98
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,800
There is more or less a rule that only one airline per European country can overfly Russia.

99
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,960
There are certainly exceptions, both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are London based

100
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,720
for example but both overfly Siberia on their routes to Shanghai and Hong Kong but Air France

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,160
is the only French airline with Siberian overflight rights, Lufthansa is the only German airline

102
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,360
with overflight rights, Iberia is the only Spanish airline with overflight rights, and

103
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,100
so on and so forth.

104
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,960
For the longest while this wasn't a problem.

105
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,360
European countries aren't that big and few had more than one intercontinental airline

106
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,560
but nowadays, however, that's changing.

107
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,920
We're seeing more and more budget airlines competing with the large, established carriers

108
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:11,840
on long-haul routes but with this system of overflight permissions, the legacy carriers

109
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,240
more or less have a monopoly on East Asian routes.

110
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,240
SAS, for example, operates out of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden and they have Siberian

111
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,760
overflight rights that take them to destinations like Tokyo, Beijing, and Shanghai.

112
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,880
SAS is therefore the only Scandinavian airline allowed to overfly Siberia.

113
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,600
But also in Scandinavia is Norwegian Air.

114
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,200
As one of the largest low-cost airlines in the world, Norwegian has pioneered long-haul

115
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,040
budget flying, mainly focusing on flights from major European cities to the US.

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,920
The airline has said, though, that it wants to expand eastwards.

117
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,940
They already have flights from Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm to Bangkok and from London

118
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,320
to Singapore but these destinations are far enough south that they don't involve flying

119
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,660
over Siberia.

120
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,900
The airline has repeatedly applied for Siberian overflight rights and repeatedly been denied.

121
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,540
They argue that SAS does not operate any flight from Norway to Asia so they should be granted

122
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:11,280
permission as the only Norwegian airline but since SAS is partially registered in Norway,

123
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,720
Russia isn't granting permission.

124
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,040
Norwegian does have a subsidiary legally registered in the UK but it's unlikely that Russia

125
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,380
would grant overflight rights to this since British Airways and Virgin Atlantic also have

126
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,920
overflight rights.

127
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,000
Norwegian Airlines also has a subsidiary based in Ireland which does not have an airline

128
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
with Siberian overflight rights but SAS also has a subsidiary based in the country which

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,860
could mean that Russia will deny rights to this subsidiary too.

130
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,680
As of now, Russia has not granted overflight permission to any budget airline.

131
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,240
Others have tried—Icelandic airlines Wow Air and Icelandair have attempted to negotiate

132
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,820
overflight rights but Russia views overflights as a way to make money and wants to charge

133
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,660
fees that would make it impossible for a low-cost airline.

134
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,100
For now, Wow Air has planned to start flights from Reykjavik to Delhi, India which, in

135
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,740
a direct routing, would fly over Russia but can route around Russia by only adding 45

136
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:07,820
minutes in extra flight time if an arrangement isn't made before flights start in December

137
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,140
2018.

138
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,600
Russia is a powerful, politically savvy country that knows that these overflight rights are

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
a huge negotiation tool.

140
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,520
Pulling the rights of a country's airline would be a huge financial blow and granting

141
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,140
rights is also a huge advantage.

142
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,780
Competition, though, is good for the consumer and this current system stifles it.

143
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,460
Until Russia starts granting overflight rights to budget airlines, non-stop flights to Asia

144
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,080
will stay expensive.

145
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,460
The fact that this shortcut over Siberia is now open at all, however, saves millions of

146
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,120
passengers yearly enormous amounts of time and money.

147
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,740
Watching this ten minute video of our technological progress might make you think that we got

148
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,440
here in one giant leap but that, of course, is not the case.

149
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,820
We had to develop new navigation systems to work around old-school compasses, build airports

150
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,980
to help planes refuel, and extend the range of aircraft.

151
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,640
The problem of it advancing enough to be able to fly non-stop to the other side of the world

152
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
was huge but it was broken down and approached in small steps.

153
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,100
Brilliant works in a similar way—breaking a problem down, identifying the relevant concepts,

154
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,640
thinking clearly through each part, and building it back up to the conclusion.

155
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:17,480
In this manner, super complex topics like number theory or calculus can be easily understood

156
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,520
by anyone.

157
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,440
My favorite from Brilliant is their logic course which starts simple but then builds

158
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,360
up your skills so you can solve seemingly impossible problems.
