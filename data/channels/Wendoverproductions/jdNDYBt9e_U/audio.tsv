10480	15760	This is East Asia, comprised of China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and this is Europe.
15760	21200	2.4 billion people live in these two areas—a third of the world's population.
21200	26720	More impressively, each of these two areas have a GDP of around $20 trillion.
26720	32360	Combined, just these countries account for half of the world's economic activity.
32360	37080	They are two of the world's most dense, most developed, and most economically interlinked
37080	42000	regions and are home to the world's largest and most influential cities yet laying between
42000	45440	them is just one country—Russia.
45440	50140	This more or less means that one country controls whether Europe can get to Asia and vice versa
50140	52780	and for a while, they couldn't.
52780	57040	During the cold war, almost universally, non-Soviet airlines were not allowed to fly
57040	58820	over the Soviet Union.
58820	61420	This proved a huge barrier to travel.
61420	66260	In the 1950s, flying on BOAC, which later became British Airways, the fastest route
66260	72500	from London to Tokyo involved leaving London at 10 AM on Friday and stopping in Rome, Beirut,
72500	79340	Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Yangon, Bangkok, and Manila before finally arriving in Tokyo
79340	81580	at 6 AM on a Sunday.
81580	87820	All in all, that was 36 hours and 10,000 miles of travel to get between two cities 6,000
87820	92460	miles apart and that was also their fastest service on the Comet jet plane.
92460	96620	Their slower and cheaper propeller service would leave London on a Sunday and not arrive
96620	101300	in Tokyo until Thursday after 88 hours of travel.
101300	106900	It was just hugely inefficient but there was a better way—over the Arctic.
106900	112380	SAS was the first to develop routes overflying the Arctic but other airlines soon followed.
112380	116300	These routes were first used to get to the American west coast faster.
116300	120900	This involved developing new navigation systems to overcome the issue of traditional magnetic
120900	123660	compasses not working properly in the high north.
123660	128860	In the 1950s, no commercial airplane had the range to fly to the American west coast non-stop
128860	133340	but with SAS' new polar route, they would take a relatively quick route from Copenhagen
133340	138600	stopping in Kangerlussuaar, Greenland, and Winnipeg, Canada before arriving in Los Angeles.
138600	142600	This cut what was previously a 36 hour trip down to 22.
142600	146880	With SAS having proven that commercial flights over the Arctic were both safe and commercially
146880	151180	viable, other airlines quickly followed not only setting up routes to the American west
151180	153900	coast but also to the far east.
153900	158220	The most direct route from London to Tokyo flies over Siberia but since that airspace
158220	163100	was closed airlines chose another way—the other way around the world.
163100	168420	In the 1960s, only 40,000 people lived in Anchorage, Alaska and Alaska had just become
168420	173780	a state the year before but its airport emerged as a crucial stopping point between Europe
173780	174780	and Asia.
174780	180720	BOAC's thrice weekly polar route from London to Tokyo would leave Heathrow at 1.45 pm,
180720	184600	arrive in Anchorage nine and a half hours later, stop for an hour to refuel, and then
184600	187100	fly the remaining seven hours to Tokyo.
187100	192340	All in all, it was timetable to take only 17 and a half hours—half of what the trip
192340	193340	took before.
193340	197940	It was as drastic a reduction in travel time as when Concord cut New York to London flights
197940	199820	from six hours to three.
199820	201860	BOAC wasn't the only one.
201860	206340	All the major European carriers set up routes to the far east via Anchorage in the 1960s
206340	207340	and 70s.
207340	211860	While Anchorage sees only a few dozen daily commercial flights mostly to the continental
211860	218900	US today, in the 1970s it was served by Air France, SAS, KLM, Iberia, Lufthansa, Japan
218900	221200	Airlines, Korean Air, and more.
221200	226100	This tiny town in Alaska quickly became one of the most connected and cosmopolitan areas
226100	230780	of the world with passengers and flight crews from all around the world stopping over all
230780	233100	because of where it was.
233100	237180	As aircraft became more advanced with longer range, there were a few airlines that managed
237180	240700	to avoid stopping in Anchorage on their way from Europe to East Asia.
240700	246200	Thin Air, for example, started flying from Helsinki to Tokyo non-stop in 1983 by flying
246200	249980	in international airspace north of Russia over the North Pole.
249980	255040	This made what is today a nine-hour flight 13 hours but it was still faster than stopping
255040	256080	in Anchorage.
256080	259940	Overwhelmingly though, airlines continued to fly through Anchorage.
259940	264640	Eventually though, the Soviet Union did of course fall in 1991 and with that Russia started
264640	268460	to grant overflight rights to European and East Asian airlines.
268460	272660	They first had to modernize and anglicize their air traffic control system.
272660	277340	All international pilots and air traffic controllers worldwide speak English but before, since
277340	281420	there were few international flights over Russia, the Russian air traffic controllers
281420	282740	didn't speak English.
282740	286580	Once the changes were made, airlines quickly switched to flying non-stop from Europe to
286580	288540	Asia over Siberia.
288540	291160	That left Anchorage largely deserted.
291160	296080	The airport built a large and modern international terminal in 1982 to handle all the traffic
296080	300840	passing through the airport but then, less than 10 years later, all those airlines that
300840	303600	kept the airport busy left in droves.
303600	308440	Today, that international terminal, built to handle hundreds of flights per month, only
308440	310600	sees a flight every few days.
310600	315440	Russia, meanwhile, is prospering thanks to the opening up of its airspace.
315440	320460	Flying to Asia over Siberia saves airlines huge amounts of time and money so Russia therefore
320460	323720	charges airlines huge amounts of money to do so.
323720	328020	Flight numbers vary by airline and are kept secret but for each round-trip flight between
328020	333760	Europe and Asia, Siberian overflight fees are believed to account for up to $100 of
333760	336380	a single passenger's ticket price.
336380	341080	Russia has an enormous amount of power by controlling this airspace and they use it
341080	342280	to their advantage.
342280	347360	133 countries have signed the International Civil Aviation Organization's Transit Agreement
347360	351320	which essentially allows any airline from any country to fly through the signatory's
351320	356200	airspace but Russia, however, has not so they can pick and choose which countries airlines
356200	358160	get to fly through their airspace.
358160	362200	The country can and has used its airspace as a geopolitical weapon.
362200	366460	In 2014 they threatened to shut down their airspace to European Union Airlines in response
366460	371120	to sanctions, in 2017 they threatened to close their airspace to Dutch Airlines in response
371120	375680	to a reduction in landing slots for a Russian airline at Schiphol airport, and in April
375680	380240	2018 they tacitly threatened to close their airspace to US airlines in response to US
381240	382240	military action in Syria.
382240	387000	But Russia not only decides which countries can fly in its airspace, it also decides which
387000	388880	specific airlines.
388880	393800	There is more or less a rule that only one airline per European country can overfly Russia.
393800	397960	There are certainly exceptions, both British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are London based
397960	402720	for example but both overfly Siberia on their routes to Shanghai and Hong Kong but Air France
402720	407160	is the only French airline with Siberian overflight rights, Lufthansa is the only German airline
407160	411360	with overflight rights, Iberia is the only Spanish airline with overflight rights, and
411360	413100	so on and so forth.
413100	415960	For the longest while this wasn't a problem.
415960	420360	European countries aren't that big and few had more than one intercontinental airline
420360	422560	but nowadays, however, that's changing.
422560	426920	We're seeing more and more budget airlines competing with the large, established carriers
426920	431840	on long-haul routes but with this system of overflight permissions, the legacy carriers
431840	435240	more or less have a monopoly on East Asian routes.
435240	440240	SAS, for example, operates out of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden and they have Siberian
440240	444760	overflight rights that take them to destinations like Tokyo, Beijing, and Shanghai.
444760	449880	SAS is therefore the only Scandinavian airline allowed to overfly Siberia.
449880	452600	But also in Scandinavia is Norwegian Air.
452600	457200	As one of the largest low-cost airlines in the world, Norwegian has pioneered long-haul
457200	462040	budget flying, mainly focusing on flights from major European cities to the US.
462040	465920	The airline has said, though, that it wants to expand eastwards.
465920	469940	They already have flights from Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm to Bangkok and from London
469940	474320	to Singapore but these destinations are far enough south that they don't involve flying
474320	475660	over Siberia.
475660	480900	The airline has repeatedly applied for Siberian overflight rights and repeatedly been denied.
480900	485540	They argue that SAS does not operate any flight from Norway to Asia so they should be granted
485540	491280	permission as the only Norwegian airline but since SAS is partially registered in Norway,
491280	493720	Russia isn't granting permission.
493720	498040	Norwegian does have a subsidiary legally registered in the UK but it's unlikely that Russia
498040	502380	would grant overflight rights to this since British Airways and Virgin Atlantic also have
502380	503920	overflight rights.
503920	508000	Norwegian Airlines also has a subsidiary based in Ireland which does not have an airline
508000	513000	with Siberian overflight rights but SAS also has a subsidiary based in the country which
513000	516860	could mean that Russia will deny rights to this subsidiary too.
516860	521680	As of now, Russia has not granted overflight permission to any budget airline.
521680	526240	Others have tried—Icelandic airlines Wow Air and Icelandair have attempted to negotiate
526240	530820	overflight rights but Russia views overflights as a way to make money and wants to charge
530820	534660	fees that would make it impossible for a low-cost airline.
534660	539100	For now, Wow Air has planned to start flights from Reykjavik to Delhi, India which, in
539100	543740	a direct routing, would fly over Russia but can route around Russia by only adding 45
543740	547820	minutes in extra flight time if an arrangement isn't made before flights start in December
547820	549140	2018.
549140	553600	Russia is a powerful, politically savvy country that knows that these overflight rights are
553600	555600	a huge negotiation tool.
555600	559520	Pulling the rights of a country's airline would be a huge financial blow and granting
559520	562140	rights is also a huge advantage.
562140	566780	Competition, though, is good for the consumer and this current system stifles it.
566780	571460	Until Russia starts granting overflight rights to budget airlines, non-stop flights to Asia
571460	573080	will stay expensive.
573080	577460	The fact that this shortcut over Siberia is now open at all, however, saves millions of
577460	582120	passengers yearly enormous amounts of time and money.
582120	585740	Watching this ten minute video of our technological progress might make you think that we got
585740	589440	here in one giant leap but that, of course, is not the case.
589440	593820	We had to develop new navigation systems to work around old-school compasses, build airports
593820	596980	to help planes refuel, and extend the range of aircraft.
596980	600640	The problem of it advancing enough to be able to fly non-stop to the other side of the world
600640	604720	was huge but it was broken down and approached in small steps.
604720	609100	Brilliant works in a similar way—breaking a problem down, identifying the relevant concepts,
609100	612640	thinking clearly through each part, and building it back up to the conclusion.
612640	617480	In this manner, super complex topics like number theory or calculus can be easily understood
617480	618520	by anyone.
618520	622440	My favorite from Brilliant is their logic course which starts simple but then builds
622440	626360	up your skills so you can solve seemingly impossible problems.
