0	5820	The opening shot of Golf Civil War came in the form of a press release.
5820	11340	Published on a Friday in late October of 2021, the newly formed company, Liv Golf Investments,
11340	16580	with the backing of the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, announced its commitment of $200 million
16580	21380	to establish 10 new marquee professional golf tournaments.
21380	27500	It also announced its new CEO, the brash Australian, the former world number one golfer, the shark
27500	29500	Greg Norman.
29500	32940	And it announced, well, little else.
32940	36900	Who would play, where they'd play, and exactly how these tournaments would be played were
36900	38820	details for a later date.
38820	44620	Instead, the release opted for platitudes and an ominous promise—that this was only
44620	46300	the beginning.
46300	49980	For other established sports leagues, it might be easy to write off the arrival of such an
49980	52500	overly vague and optimistic challenger.
52500	56340	The established leagues have the money, they have the TV deals, and most importantly, they
56340	57620	have the talent.
57620	62500	The PGA Tour, the most prestigious golf circuit in the world, however, is a little different.
62500	68620	While it has the money and TV deals, it doesn't pay for the luxury of keeping its talent locked
68620	70140	down.
70140	73620	Whereas most professional sports leagues pay their players consistent base salaries with
73620	79260	the occasional incentive looped into a contract, the PGA Tour only pays for winning.
79260	84060	For the world's very best, this works just fine—show up to a third or maybe a half
84060	88220	of the 40-something annual PGA tournaments, post a score good enough to land in the money
88220	92560	or even win outright, bring home the winnings, and cash in on the media attention through
92560	93780	endorsement deals.
93780	97940	But this creates a problem for those in the middle and back of the pack—elite golfers
97940	102520	in their own right, but golfers who are paying for their own travel, coaching, and accommodations
102520	107580	only to quite possibly finish outside the money if they don't play to their full potential.
107580	113040	All this is to say, the PGA Tour and its pay structure, along with its stuffy, hesitant-to-change
113040	119000	culture was ripe for a challenge—and they knew it as well as anyone.
119000	123120	The counter to the live announcement came from the tour's wary commissioner, Jay Monahan,
123120	126920	who sent each tour member a memo explaining they were sweetening the pot.
126920	130960	For the upcoming season, there'd be more prize money at tournaments, more money devoted
130960	135000	to the player impact program that compensates for their roles in boosting the tour's engagement,
135000	139800	and that there'd be an entirely new bonus fund for players appearing in 15 or more PGA
139800	140800	events.
140800	143560	If the carrot wasn't enough, there was also the stick.
143560	147040	Along with more money, Monahan also warned that if players defected to whatever this
147040	151900	new league was, they'd be banned from playing in the PGA Tour.
151900	155800	For one of golf's biggest names, and one of the PGA's highest earners, the carrot
155800	161740	wasn't enough, and the stick was just another example of an organization with too much power.
161740	166500	Following Monahan's counter, Phil Mickelson, the longtime fan favorite, the lovable lefty
166500	170280	who just so happened to be playing in the Saudi international tournament, took the time
170280	174080	in an interview about his future to point out that the PGA Tour's greed had reached
174080	178800	obnoxious proportions—that their hoarding of players' digital media rights worth millions,
178800	182680	among other things, was pushing players to look for new places to play.
182680	186920	While he didn't say that he had found a new place to play, the writing was on the
186920	187920	wall.
187920	190440	Secession was in the air.
190440	193120	Back in the States, the tour went on.
193120	197560	But at each stop, the tension built, rumors circulated on who was making the jump, and
197560	203000	ever so quietly, offers of guaranteed contracts in the tens of millions began making their
203000	204800	way to top players.
204800	209520	Then suddenly, as the golf world descended on the Riviera Golf Course in California's
209520	215200	Pacific Palisades for the Genesis Open, a bombshell article rocked the sports world,
215200	219240	nearly collapsing the Saudi coup before it even really took shape.
219240	222920	With his new biography on Mickelson available for pre-order, and the media buzz over the
222920	227300	mysterious Saudi Challenger building, Alan Shipnick felt the timing was right to pull
227300	228940	back the curtain.
228940	234240	Mickelson was, in fact, working with the startup Saudi League, having already recruited three
234240	236900	other top players to make the flip.
236900	241680	But of bigger consequence, Mickelson was aware of the bigger picture, too.
241680	245940	He called the league nothing more than sports-washing, he called the Saudis scary, and he made no
245940	250760	qualms about the fact that the move was about nothing more than money and leverage.
250760	255660	In the story's wake, golfers now had to make their intentions clear to fans and media—were
255660	260220	they so focused on the money they'd overlook Saudi Arabian atrocities like the money-obsessed
260220	262020	Mickelson?
262020	267040	Some stayed coy, alluding to or outright mentioning that they'd sign NDAs, effectively signaling
267040	271620	that they were likely deep in negotiations with Liv or had already come to an agreement.
271620	275860	But most, especially golf's biggest names who were rumored targets of Liv, went out
275860	280420	of their way to align themselves with the PGA Tour and to disparage the Saudi-backed
280420	281720	Challenger.
281720	286520	Before anyone really knew what it would be, the Saudi project seemed dead.
286520	291440	Mickelson stepped away from golf for the moment, and the world moved on.
291440	298820	Then, Greg Norman announced the Liv Golf Invitational—eight tournaments, five of which not halfway across
298820	305520	the world, but in the US, an eye-watering $255 million in prize money for a field of
305520	311320	only 48 players, and a format that had golfers only playing three rounds rather than four.
311320	316440	Essentially, it was a tour with convenient locations, lower stress, less competition,
316440	320880	and prize money that, on a tournament-by-tournament basis, would usually more than double what
320880	322400	the PGA Tour offered.
322400	326560	It was a tour whose leader was one of golf's most famous figureheads, it was a tour that
326560	330880	conveniently distanced itself from its Saudi Arabian roots in locations and branding, and
330880	335560	it was a tour that injected more money into the sport than anyone could have imagined.
335560	339560	For its part, the PGA Tour thought it was in the clear—they had already dangled the
339560	343360	carrot, outlined potential punishment, and after benefiting from Mickelson putting his
343360	348920	foot in his mouth, they simply couldn't be bothered—they had moved on.
348920	351600	Players, though, began to reconsider.
351600	356480	One by one, they decided that perhaps it wasn't too toxic of a public relations move to join
356480	360800	the tour, or that the money was, at least, more valuable than the image hit.
360800	366140	Dustin Johnson was the first big name to turn on his early promise to back the PGA, signing
366140	373220	for $125 million to flip allegiances and resigning his PGA membership.
373220	377460	Then, at the very first live tournament, the benefits of defecting became all the more
377460	382120	obvious as Charles Schwartzl, a lower-profile PGA Tour player who hadn't finished first
382120	389560	in a tour event in six years, ended up winning a cool $4.75 million.
389560	393620	Not long after, DeChambeau too countered his previous statements and joined the Saudi-backed
393620	398300	tour, then came Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith, two of golf's brightest stars.
398300	403580	Golf's Civil War, the one the PGA Tour thought it had already won, was a back-on, with the
403580	408900	Saudi side flipping the battlefield with nothing more than a massive influx of cash.
408900	415620	Live, however, is far from Saudi Arabia's first foray into professional sports.
415620	420140	This is World Wrestling Entertainment's 2022 schedule of pay-per-view events.
420500	425740	While WWE packs a non-stop calendar of TV shows and non-televised events, these specials
425740	430360	are the ones you hear about—the biggest moneymakers for the entertainment company.
430360	436060	They feature the biggest stars—Roman Reigns, Hulk Hogan, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, The Undertaker—and
436060	439980	the biggest plot points in the series' ongoing scripted narrative.
439980	442300	Correspondingly, they are rare.
442300	448100	2022 saw 17 across the year, just three of which occurring outside the US—September's
448100	452900	Clash at the Castle in Wales, while the two other international events were held in Jeddah
452900	454740	and Riyadh.
454740	458420	Searching through the company's quarterly reports, it's no wonder why.
458420	463500	Every few quarters, the media revenue attributed to the other category shoots up by about $50
463500	465220	million.
465220	469880	Dating back to 2018, the quarters when this happens corresponds exactly to when the company
469880	475420	hosts an event in Saudi Arabia—it even drops out when events were cancelled due to COVID.
475420	481380	This has led to an understanding that Saudi Arabia is paying the company about $50 million
481380	482500	per event.
482500	487500	Scanning down and to the right puts that into perspective—with a mere two per year summing
487500	494420	to a massive $100 million, these Saudi events are responsible for close to 10% of the annual
494420	499300	revenue of the world's 37th most valuable entertainment company.
499300	500840	And they've been popular.
500840	505700	After all, the scripted nature of WWE allows the company to guarantee it.
505700	510720	At the 2022 event in Wales, Clash at the Castle, many speculated that reigning champion Roman
510720	515380	Reigns would be set to lose to Scottish contender Drew McIntyre because the Scottish underdog
515380	520160	winning against the American champion is exactly what the European fans would want to see,
520160	524320	and traditionally, the entertainment company scripts their storylines to entertain their
524320	525360	fans.
525360	529960	But in this case, the customer was Saudi Arabia, and in order to guarantee the reigning champion
529960	533880	would fight up-and-coming star Logan Paul in Riyadh that November, a fight that was
533880	539440	sure to generate massive attention, Roman Reigns had to win in Wales.
539440	544120	But the drama outside the arena was far more real.
544120	549040	Three years prior, the 2019 edition of the same Crown Jewel event failed to air live
549040	550880	as scheduled in its host country.
550880	556040	There is still no official explanation for this, but there are plenty of rumors.
556040	561020	They go that the Saudi government was late on a $60 million payment for the prior event.
561020	566080	That part is corroborated in financial reports, and either to force their hand or in retribution,
566080	570040	WWE briefly cut off the fee to the Saudi local broadcaster.
570040	575120	Ultimately, the event did make it to broadcast in its host country with a one-hour tape delay,
575120	578920	but then WWE faced its own issues.
578920	582920	As 200 performers and personnel gathered for their 3AM charter flight to Buffalo, New York,
582920	586780	where the company's flagship Monday Night Raw show is being filmed, flight crew started
586780	593900	to announce delay after delay after delay with no real explanation for why.
593900	598720	One anonymous wrestler later testified in a lawsuit against WWE, stating that the doors
598720	602400	of the plane were blocked by armed guards and black militia attire, and that a crewmember
602400	606080	stated, it seems someone doesn't want us to leave the country.
606080	610040	The wrestler also said the company's senior director of talent relations told him that
610040	614480	the payment's dispute had truly occurred, that the fee was cut, and that the Saudi Crown
614480	617900	Prince was quote, very mad.
617900	622800	This interpretation of the events led many to describe it as a hostage incident—that
622800	627560	Saudi Arabia failed to allow the plane to take off, to get back at WWE.
627560	633340	Now, this testimony is only one small part of a larger suit alleging that WWE misrepresented
633340	637440	broadcast rights negotiations with the Saudi government to its investors, but despite their
637440	644520	best efforts, WWE could not get this lawsuit dismissed and settled for $39 million.
644520	648480	Not an admission of guilt, but at least an indication that it was too difficult to disprove
648480	649700	the claims.
649700	654840	Of course, WWE has vehemently denied rumors of this so-called hostage incident, claiming
654840	656720	that it was just mechanical issues.
656720	661360	Wrestlers, meanwhile, have been tight-lipped and vague when talking about it—potentially
661360	664760	wary to threaten their highly lucrative contracts with the company.
664760	669600	But in this case, the facts hardly matter to Saudi Arabia, because the public believes
669600	670600	it.
670600	675240	The country turned the spotlight on itself, and in return, a story emerged that only shaped
675240	679360	the uninformed's understanding of how the country, and its ruling royals, operates.
679360	683420	And it's hardly the only time this has happened.
683420	688680	In 2022, the second-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, a stop on Formula One's globe-spanning
688680	693680	calendar, was overshadowed by a massive plume of smoke in the background.
693680	697560	This was visible during the Friday's practice sessions, but as on-track action finished
697560	703640	up for the night, reports emerged that this wasn't a simple fire—it was an attack.
703640	708160	More specifically, it was an attack by Houthi rebels who fight one side of the ongoing civil
708160	710040	war in neighboring Yemen.
710040	715760	Now, this conflict is widely understood as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
715760	719520	Iran is supporting the Houthi rebels, Saudi Arabia the former central government, worried
719520	724200	that a Houthi-led Yemen would function as a satellite state of Iran—an untenable proposition
724200	726080	given their massive land porter.
726080	730760	Therefore, the Houthis regularly undertake attacks on Saudi Arabia, as they did in this
730760	734480	case on an oil depot on the outskirts of Jeddah.
734480	738520	Immediately, a drivers' union meeting was called to discuss whether they'd forced
738520	743720	the cancellation of the race, and reportedly, the initial consensus was yes.
743720	747320	In the minutes and hours that followed, a rotating cast of team principals, Formula
747320	751440	1 executives, Saudi Arabian officials, and others came through the room, convincing drivers
751440	755760	of the strength of air defense systems around the track, and supposedly discussing the quote
755760	759280	consequences of the race not going ahead as planned.
759280	764160	Meanwhile, discussion erupted on social media, as pictures emerged from the endless drivers'
764160	768240	meeting, and much of it was over why the race would be threatened by a drone attack in the
768240	769660	first place.
769660	774240	In the end, after four and a half hours stretching into the early morning, drivers relented and
774240	778800	the race went ahead as planned, but once again, the spotlight shone on Saudi Arabia
778800	781960	and the picture wasn't pretty.
781960	786160	The Kingdom has been widely condemned for its role in what the UN describes as the world's
786160	788280	worst humanitarian crisis, in Yemen.
788280	791800	They've imposed an air and sea blockade on the country that has contributed to the
791800	795560	deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians due to famine.
795560	799120	According to Human Rights Watch, there is also a pattern of Saudi-led strikes on civilian
799120	804220	areas or on military targets in densely populated areas where civilian casualties are inevitable
804220	807660	—both of which are a violation of the laws of war.
807660	812520	The Saudi coalition has also engaged in so-called double-tapping, where one airstrike is conducted
812520	817900	then another is later done in the same spot on those that come to aid the injured.
817900	822660	But Saudi Arabia's repressiveness is not best defined by its war crimes.
822660	827700	After all, tragically, they are hardly the only nation conducting such attacks.
827700	832300	There is wide understanding that a number of developed Middle Eastern nations are repressive,
832300	834200	by Western standards.
834200	838320	Nations like Qatar and the UAE are known for the dissonance between their flashy, westernized
838320	841100	cityscapes and their limited human rights.
841100	845520	Both engage in widespread modern slavery, both severely limit women's rights, both
845520	850180	heavily restrict freedom of speech and the press, both have zero LGBT rights and police
850180	856120	forces that regularly abuse and torture queer people, the list goes on and on.
856120	860800	But even compared to this, Saudi Arabia isn't a league of its own.
860800	865080	Whereas Qatar and the UAE have laws on the books criminalizing homosexuality but rarely
865080	870320	enforce them, Saudi Arabia does—regularly punishing with prison sentences, lashes, and
870320	872000	even execution.
872000	876040	Whereas Qatar restricts access by women to certain venues and the UAE forbids women from
876040	880640	initiating divorce without court order, Saudi Arabia still operates under a strict guardianship
880640	885120	system where women must obtain approval from a male guardian for certain rights.
885120	889960	For example, women of all ages need their guardian's approval to marry, and once married
889960	894540	women are legally required to remain quote, obedient to their husband, even to the extent
894540	897840	of not refusing sex without a quote, legitimate excuse.
897840	902280	But the nation's brutality can't even be fully described in such a comparative manner
902280	907520	because a key tenet of it is the fact that Saudi Arabia barely has codified laws.
907520	911860	Judges sentence based on ambiguous and changing interpretations of Sharia law, which is based
911860	916720	on the Qur'an, but that means people are regularly sentenced, even to death, for ambiguous,
916720	921520	unprovable crimes leading to wide-scaled, institutionalized jailing and killing of those
921520	926560	who dare challenge the ruling royal family's reign in any way.
926560	931080	According to Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World survey, the nation is, by a sizable
931080	935220	margin, the least free nation in the world to be so wealthy.
935220	939000	That puts the nation in a unique situation from a branding perspective.
939000	943660	All of these nations, the other wealthiest in the world, get wealthy world things like
943660	946680	golf and WWE and Formula One.
946680	951620	And while far from perfect, these other nations are on balance far less repressive than Saudi
951620	952620	Arabia.
952620	956740	Therefore, when people's primary exposure to the nation is through wealthy world entertainment
956740	961860	franchises, it's only natural to assume that Saudi Arabia is similar to the UAE or
961860	964380	United Kingdom or UK.
964380	968780	But Phil Mickelson, at least, recognized just how problematic the Saudi regime was when
968780	972260	he noted their role in human rights abuse and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
972860	977060	And the PGA Tour proved well-aware, too, as time and time again, they've brought up
977060	981820	Saudi Arabia's role in 9-11 during their public battle against Liv for hearts, minds,
981820	983180	and golfers.
983180	988700	But money simply proved too much for Mickelson in 2021, and in the summer of 2023, the PGA
988700	992900	Tour found itself in the same position as the golfer.
992900	998580	On June 6th, the PGA Tour announced something that not a single one of its players saw coming.
998580	1001060	It was merging with Liv.
1001060	1006240	The two leagues would quit poaching one another's players, they'd drop the lawsuits and counter-lawsuits,
1006240	1011200	and the Saudi Public Investment Fund would be the exclusive investor in the merged tour.
1011200	1013940	It was a complete shock.
1013940	1017500	It was bigger than golf, bigger than sports.
1017500	1021400	Following the announcement, Commissioner Monaghan, who had railed against the atrocities committed
1021400	1026380	by Saudi Arabia, offered a statement trying to justify the deal while 9-11 families, golfers
1026380	1030340	who had turned down tens of millions on principles that Monaghan had outlined, and the wider
1030340	1033940	world quickly called him and the tour hypocrites.
1033940	1038860	Monaghan was a hypocrite, but ultimately, from a business perspective, he was likely
1038860	1040460	right to concede.
1040460	1045340	In the coming days, it became clear that Monaghan had understood this for a while, telling tour
1045340	1048460	employees that they couldn't compete with a foreign government with unlimited money
1048460	1053180	in a private meeting, and started the process of negotiating some months earlier.
1053180	1058380	The merger was at once indefensible and inevitable, because neither money nor profitability were
1058380	1061900	the reason for Saudi Arabia's entrance into professional golf.
1061900	1067740	Liv, with hardly a TV deal or any real path to profitability, would simply outlast the
1067740	1069300	PGA Tour.
1069300	1073800	With an estimated $50 million spent in legal fees and $100 million spent on bigger purses
1073800	1079860	and player bonuses, PGA Tour reserves had begun to run dry by early 2022, and the only
1079860	1085260	recourse was to give the sovereign wealth fund what it really wanted—a seat at the
1085260	1086820	table.
1086820	1091820	With every additional overlap between professional sports and Saudi Arabia, global media speculates
1091820	1094380	on what the nation's intentions truly are.
1094380	1099540	It's not money, at least not now, as they're spending far more than could ever return to
1099540	1101820	develop their profile of professional sports.
1101820	1107200	It's also not the short-term image effects, as often suggested, since for as much as Formula
1107200	1113220	One or WWE or Liv imply a level of legitimacy for the nation, they also highlight its repressiveness
1113220	1114420	and regressiveness.
1114420	1119860	It's only natural—the nation is repressive and regressive, so when you bring international
1119860	1123940	cameras and journalists an attention that can't be stymied by intimidation, arrest,
1123940	1128700	and imprisonment as domestic equivalents can, inevitably the world is going to hear about
1128700	1129700	the nation's issues.
1129700	1135220	And when the global consensus is that legitimizing Saudi Arabia through sports is a bad idea,
1135220	1139780	stories or even rumors proving that point are only going to be amplified further.
1139780	1145540	But it's ultimately quite tough to evaluate decision-making in an absolute monarchy.
1145540	1150620	At the end of the day, maybe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman just really likes sports,
1150620	1154820	or maybe he just wants fun events for him and his wealthy friends, or maybe there's
1154820	1159020	not much strategy at all behind this foray into professional sports since even the billions
1159020	1163780	being spent on it are a paltry sum compared to the scale of royal family wealth in Saudi
1163780	1165540	Arabia.
1165540	1169820	Perhaps the most cohesive explanation, though, is that this isn't some short-term branding
1169820	1170820	exercise.
1170820	1174220	The Kingdom isn't expecting the world to think positively about it just because they
1174220	1176020	put on some decent golf.
1176020	1182060	Rather, this seems one small part of the nation's massive reorientation.
1182060	1188620	Saudi Arabia is trying very, very hard to set itself up for a post-oil era.
1188620	1194500	In doing so, it's trying very, very hard to become a place like Dubai—a diversified,
1194500	1198660	modern, service-based Middle Eastern economy as integrated with the world as Singapore
1198660	1199660	or Sao Paulo.
1199660	1204420	It's trying to end its era of isolation and become a player in international affairs
1204420	1209420	as the era of insularity funded by oil exports draws closer to a close.
1209420	1213720	This is a practical necessity for the ruling family, since the tolerance of their grip
1213720	1218620	on power has been undergirded by the prosperity brought to the nation during their reign.
1218620	1223740	If this prosperity fails to maintain into a post-oil era, so too might the monarchy
1223740	1225700	itself.
1225700	1230740	As part of this, genuine reform is happening—many of the nation's most repressive policies
1230740	1233780	are no longer, but mostly the most visible ones.
1233780	1238180	The indiscriminate arrest, jailing, torture, and execution of dissidents and activists
1238180	1239860	still occur.
1239860	1244100	The absence of democracy is still unchanged.
1244100	1248180	Saudi Arabia's are dominating the conversation about Saudi Arabia, but they're also creating
1248180	1249180	conversation.
1249180	1253940	They're not necessarily supposed to be immediately and directly effective at rebranding the nation.
1253940	1256780	Rather, they're part of the long game.
1256780	1261820	WWE or Formula One or professional golf just embed themselves with other parts of the wealthy
1261820	1263740	world naturally.
1263740	1268460	Saudi Arabia, as it makes its transition out of insularity, needs to force it.
1268460	1271340	They're faking it until they make it.
1271980	1275540	So the question asked every time they make an additional encroachment into sports is
1275540	1279820	whether it's right to help Saudi Arabia fake it before they've made it—before
1279820	1284420	they've genuinely turned themselves into a place that respects human rights.
1284420	1289320	Sports executives constantly argue that the order of operations is right—that engagement
1289320	1294260	with Western culture will propagate Western principles of human rights—but through this,
1294260	1298420	these executives are making a massive gamble on whether they'll land on the right side
1298420	1299780	of history.
1299780	1304300	Because the other option is that their executive bonuses are being based on their culpability
1304300	1309580	in branding the nation as a place that respects human rights without them actually doing so—because,
1309580	1314720	after all, the best possible future for Saudi's rulers is that they get to continue their
1314720	1321740	autocratic ways while being perceived and treated by the Western world as a normal place.
1321740	1323720	The world has problems.
1323720	1328060	In many cases, because power is concentrated and held by a small number of individuals
1328060	1332160	who happen to be the same people who are best able to profit from problems.
1332160	1335960	But despite that, these same problems get solved by the actions of those who have devoted
1335960	1337620	their lives to solving them.
1337620	1342240	If you're worried about the threat of AI or pandemics or nuclear bombs or global wars
