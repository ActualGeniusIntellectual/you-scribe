00:00.000 --> 00:05.820
The opening shot of Golf Civil War came in the form of a press release.

00:05.820 --> 00:11.340
Published on a Friday in late October of 2021, the newly formed company, Liv Golf Investments,

00:11.340 --> 00:16.580
with the backing of the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, announced its commitment of $200 million

00:16.580 --> 00:21.380
to establish 10 new marquee professional golf tournaments.

00:21.380 --> 00:27.500
It also announced its new CEO, the brash Australian, the former world number one golfer, the shark

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500
Greg Norman.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.940
And it announced, well, little else.

00:32.940 --> 00:36.900
Who would play, where they'd play, and exactly how these tournaments would be played were

00:36.900 --> 00:38.820
details for a later date.

00:38.820 --> 00:44.620
Instead, the release opted for platitudes and an ominous promise—that this was only

00:44.620 --> 00:46.300
the beginning.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.980
For other established sports leagues, it might be easy to write off the arrival of such an

00:49.980 --> 00:52.500
overly vague and optimistic challenger.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.340
The established leagues have the money, they have the TV deals, and most importantly, they

00:56.340 --> 00:57.620
have the talent.

00:57.620 --> 01:02.500
The PGA Tour, the most prestigious golf circuit in the world, however, is a little different.

01:02.500 --> 01:08.620
While it has the money and TV deals, it doesn't pay for the luxury of keeping its talent locked

01:08.620 --> 01:10.140
down.

01:10.140 --> 01:13.620
Whereas most professional sports leagues pay their players consistent base salaries with

01:13.620 --> 01:19.260
the occasional incentive looped into a contract, the PGA Tour only pays for winning.

01:19.260 --> 01:24.060
For the world's very best, this works just fine—show up to a third or maybe a half

01:24.060 --> 01:28.220
of the 40-something annual PGA tournaments, post a score good enough to land in the money

01:28.220 --> 01:32.560
or even win outright, bring home the winnings, and cash in on the media attention through

01:32.560 --> 01:33.780
endorsement deals.

01:33.780 --> 01:37.940
But this creates a problem for those in the middle and back of the pack—elite golfers

01:37.940 --> 01:42.520
in their own right, but golfers who are paying for their own travel, coaching, and accommodations

01:42.520 --> 01:47.580
only to quite possibly finish outside the money if they don't play to their full potential.

01:47.580 --> 01:53.040
All this is to say, the PGA Tour and its pay structure, along with its stuffy, hesitant-to-change

01:53.040 --> 01:59.000
culture was ripe for a challenge—and they knew it as well as anyone.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.120
The counter to the live announcement came from the tour's wary commissioner, Jay Monahan,

02:03.120 --> 02:06.920
who sent each tour member a memo explaining they were sweetening the pot.

02:06.920 --> 02:10.960
For the upcoming season, there'd be more prize money at tournaments, more money devoted

02:10.960 --> 02:15.000
to the player impact program that compensates for their roles in boosting the tour's engagement,

02:15.000 --> 02:19.800
and that there'd be an entirely new bonus fund for players appearing in 15 or more PGA

02:19.800 --> 02:20.800
events.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.560
If the carrot wasn't enough, there was also the stick.

02:23.560 --> 02:27.040
Along with more money, Monahan also warned that if players defected to whatever this

02:27.040 --> 02:31.900
new league was, they'd be banned from playing in the PGA Tour.

02:31.900 --> 02:35.800
For one of golf's biggest names, and one of the PGA's highest earners, the carrot

02:35.800 --> 02:41.740
wasn't enough, and the stick was just another example of an organization with too much power.

02:41.740 --> 02:46.500
Following Monahan's counter, Phil Mickelson, the longtime fan favorite, the lovable lefty

02:46.500 --> 02:50.280
who just so happened to be playing in the Saudi international tournament, took the time

02:50.280 --> 02:54.080
in an interview about his future to point out that the PGA Tour's greed had reached

02:54.080 --> 02:58.800
obnoxious proportions—that their hoarding of players' digital media rights worth millions,

02:58.800 --> 03:02.680
among other things, was pushing players to look for new places to play.

03:02.680 --> 03:06.920
While he didn't say that he had found a new place to play, the writing was on the

03:06.920 --> 03:07.920
wall.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.440
Secession was in the air.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.120
Back in the States, the tour went on.

03:13.120 --> 03:17.560
But at each stop, the tension built, rumors circulated on who was making the jump, and

03:17.560 --> 03:23.000
ever so quietly, offers of guaranteed contracts in the tens of millions began making their

03:23.000 --> 03:24.800
way to top players.

03:24.800 --> 03:29.520
Then suddenly, as the golf world descended on the Riviera Golf Course in California's

03:29.520 --> 03:35.200
Pacific Palisades for the Genesis Open, a bombshell article rocked the sports world,

03:35.200 --> 03:39.240
nearly collapsing the Saudi coup before it even really took shape.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.920
With his new biography on Mickelson available for pre-order, and the media buzz over the

03:42.920 --> 03:47.300
mysterious Saudi Challenger building, Alan Shipnick felt the timing was right to pull

03:47.300 --> 03:48.940
back the curtain.

03:48.940 --> 03:54.240
Mickelson was, in fact, working with the startup Saudi League, having already recruited three

03:54.240 --> 03:56.900
other top players to make the flip.

03:56.900 --> 04:01.680
But of bigger consequence, Mickelson was aware of the bigger picture, too.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.940
He called the league nothing more than sports-washing, he called the Saudis scary, and he made no

04:05.940 --> 04:10.760
qualms about the fact that the move was about nothing more than money and leverage.

04:10.760 --> 04:15.660
In the story's wake, golfers now had to make their intentions clear to fans and media—were

04:15.660 --> 04:20.220
they so focused on the money they'd overlook Saudi Arabian atrocities like the money-obsessed

04:20.220 --> 04:22.020
Mickelson?

04:22.020 --> 04:27.040
Some stayed coy, alluding to or outright mentioning that they'd sign NDAs, effectively signaling

04:27.040 --> 04:31.620
that they were likely deep in negotiations with Liv or had already come to an agreement.

04:31.620 --> 04:35.860
But most, especially golf's biggest names who were rumored targets of Liv, went out

04:35.860 --> 04:40.420
of their way to align themselves with the PGA Tour and to disparage the Saudi-backed

04:40.420 --> 04:41.720
Challenger.

04:41.720 --> 04:46.520
Before anyone really knew what it would be, the Saudi project seemed dead.

04:46.520 --> 04:51.440
Mickelson stepped away from golf for the moment, and the world moved on.

04:51.440 --> 04:58.820
Then, Greg Norman announced the Liv Golf Invitational—eight tournaments, five of which not halfway across

04:58.820 --> 05:05.520
the world, but in the US, an eye-watering $255 million in prize money for a field of

05:05.520 --> 05:11.320
only 48 players, and a format that had golfers only playing three rounds rather than four.

05:11.320 --> 05:16.440
Essentially, it was a tour with convenient locations, lower stress, less competition,

05:16.440 --> 05:20.880
and prize money that, on a tournament-by-tournament basis, would usually more than double what

05:20.880 --> 05:22.400
the PGA Tour offered.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.560
It was a tour whose leader was one of golf's most famous figureheads, it was a tour that

05:26.560 --> 05:30.880
conveniently distanced itself from its Saudi Arabian roots in locations and branding, and

05:30.880 --> 05:35.560
it was a tour that injected more money into the sport than anyone could have imagined.

05:35.560 --> 05:39.560
For its part, the PGA Tour thought it was in the clear—they had already dangled the

05:39.560 --> 05:43.360
carrot, outlined potential punishment, and after benefiting from Mickelson putting his

05:43.360 --> 05:48.920
foot in his mouth, they simply couldn't be bothered—they had moved on.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.600
Players, though, began to reconsider.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.480
One by one, they decided that perhaps it wasn't too toxic of a public relations move to join

05:56.480 --> 06:00.800
the tour, or that the money was, at least, more valuable than the image hit.

06:00.800 --> 06:06.140
Dustin Johnson was the first big name to turn on his early promise to back the PGA, signing

06:06.140 --> 06:13.220
for $125 million to flip allegiances and resigning his PGA membership.

06:13.220 --> 06:17.460
Then, at the very first live tournament, the benefits of defecting became all the more

06:17.460 --> 06:22.120
obvious as Charles Schwartzl, a lower-profile PGA Tour player who hadn't finished first

06:22.120 --> 06:29.560
in a tour event in six years, ended up winning a cool $4.75 million.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.620
Not long after, DeChambeau too countered his previous statements and joined the Saudi-backed

06:33.620 --> 06:38.300
tour, then came Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith, two of golf's brightest stars.

06:38.300 --> 06:43.580
Golf's Civil War, the one the PGA Tour thought it had already won, was a back-on, with the

06:43.580 --> 06:48.900
Saudi side flipping the battlefield with nothing more than a massive influx of cash.

06:48.900 --> 06:55.620
Live, however, is far from Saudi Arabia's first foray into professional sports.

06:55.620 --> 07:00.140
This is World Wrestling Entertainment's 2022 schedule of pay-per-view events.

07:00.500 --> 07:05.740
While WWE packs a non-stop calendar of TV shows and non-televised events, these specials

07:05.740 --> 07:10.360
are the ones you hear about—the biggest moneymakers for the entertainment company.

07:10.360 --> 07:16.060
They feature the biggest stars—Roman Reigns, Hulk Hogan, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, The Undertaker—and

07:16.060 --> 07:19.980
the biggest plot points in the series' ongoing scripted narrative.

07:19.980 --> 07:22.300
Correspondingly, they are rare.

07:22.300 --> 07:28.100
2022 saw 17 across the year, just three of which occurring outside the US—September's

07:28.100 --> 07:32.900
Clash at the Castle in Wales, while the two other international events were held in Jeddah

07:32.900 --> 07:34.740
and Riyadh.

07:34.740 --> 07:38.420
Searching through the company's quarterly reports, it's no wonder why.

07:38.420 --> 07:43.500
Every few quarters, the media revenue attributed to the other category shoots up by about $50

07:43.500 --> 07:45.220
million.

07:45.220 --> 07:49.880
Dating back to 2018, the quarters when this happens corresponds exactly to when the company

07:49.880 --> 07:55.420
hosts an event in Saudi Arabia—it even drops out when events were cancelled due to COVID.

07:55.420 --> 08:01.380
This has led to an understanding that Saudi Arabia is paying the company about $50 million

08:01.380 --> 08:02.500
per event.

08:02.500 --> 08:07.500
Scanning down and to the right puts that into perspective—with a mere two per year summing

08:07.500 --> 08:14.420
to a massive $100 million, these Saudi events are responsible for close to 10% of the annual

08:14.420 --> 08:19.300
revenue of the world's 37th most valuable entertainment company.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.840
And they've been popular.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.700
After all, the scripted nature of WWE allows the company to guarantee it.

08:25.700 --> 08:30.720
At the 2022 event in Wales, Clash at the Castle, many speculated that reigning champion Roman

08:30.720 --> 08:35.380
Reigns would be set to lose to Scottish contender Drew McIntyre because the Scottish underdog

08:35.380 --> 08:40.160
winning against the American champion is exactly what the European fans would want to see,

08:40.160 --> 08:44.320
and traditionally, the entertainment company scripts their storylines to entertain their

08:44.320 --> 08:45.360
fans.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.960
But in this case, the customer was Saudi Arabia, and in order to guarantee the reigning champion

08:49.960 --> 08:53.880
would fight up-and-coming star Logan Paul in Riyadh that November, a fight that was

08:53.880 --> 08:59.440
sure to generate massive attention, Roman Reigns had to win in Wales.

08:59.440 --> 09:04.120
But the drama outside the arena was far more real.

09:04.120 --> 09:09.040
Three years prior, the 2019 edition of the same Crown Jewel event failed to air live

09:09.040 --> 09:10.880
as scheduled in its host country.

09:10.880 --> 09:16.040
There is still no official explanation for this, but there are plenty of rumors.

09:16.040 --> 09:21.020
They go that the Saudi government was late on a $60 million payment for the prior event.

09:21.020 --> 09:26.080
That part is corroborated in financial reports, and either to force their hand or in retribution,

09:26.080 --> 09:30.040
WWE briefly cut off the fee to the Saudi local broadcaster.

09:30.040 --> 09:35.120
Ultimately, the event did make it to broadcast in its host country with a one-hour tape delay,

09:35.120 --> 09:38.920
but then WWE faced its own issues.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.920
As 200 performers and personnel gathered for their 3AM charter flight to Buffalo, New York,

09:42.920 --> 09:46.780
where the company's flagship Monday Night Raw show is being filmed, flight crew started

09:46.780 --> 09:53.900
to announce delay after delay after delay with no real explanation for why.

09:53.900 --> 09:58.720
One anonymous wrestler later testified in a lawsuit against WWE, stating that the doors

09:58.720 --> 10:02.400
of the plane were blocked by armed guards and black militia attire, and that a crewmember

10:02.400 --> 10:06.080
stated, it seems someone doesn't want us to leave the country.

10:06.080 --> 10:10.040
The wrestler also said the company's senior director of talent relations told him that

10:10.040 --> 10:14.480
the payment's dispute had truly occurred, that the fee was cut, and that the Saudi Crown

10:14.480 --> 10:17.900
Prince was quote, very mad.

10:17.900 --> 10:22.800
This interpretation of the events led many to describe it as a hostage incident—that

10:22.800 --> 10:27.560
Saudi Arabia failed to allow the plane to take off, to get back at WWE.

10:27.560 --> 10:33.340
Now, this testimony is only one small part of a larger suit alleging that WWE misrepresented

10:33.340 --> 10:37.440
broadcast rights negotiations with the Saudi government to its investors, but despite their

10:37.440 --> 10:44.520
best efforts, WWE could not get this lawsuit dismissed and settled for $39 million.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.480
Not an admission of guilt, but at least an indication that it was too difficult to disprove

10:48.480 --> 10:49.700
the claims.

10:49.700 --> 10:54.840
Of course, WWE has vehemently denied rumors of this so-called hostage incident, claiming

10:54.840 --> 10:56.720
that it was just mechanical issues.

10:56.720 --> 11:01.360
Wrestlers, meanwhile, have been tight-lipped and vague when talking about it—potentially

11:01.360 --> 11:04.760
wary to threaten their highly lucrative contracts with the company.

11:04.760 --> 11:09.600
But in this case, the facts hardly matter to Saudi Arabia, because the public believes

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
it.

11:10.600 --> 11:15.240
The country turned the spotlight on itself, and in return, a story emerged that only shaped

11:15.240 --> 11:19.360
the uninformed's understanding of how the country, and its ruling royals, operates.

11:19.360 --> 11:23.420
And it's hardly the only time this has happened.

11:23.420 --> 11:28.680
In 2022, the second-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, a stop on Formula One's globe-spanning

11:28.680 --> 11:33.680
calendar, was overshadowed by a massive plume of smoke in the background.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.560
This was visible during the Friday's practice sessions, but as on-track action finished

11:37.560 --> 11:43.640
up for the night, reports emerged that this wasn't a simple fire—it was an attack.

11:43.640 --> 11:48.160
More specifically, it was an attack by Houthi rebels who fight one side of the ongoing civil

11:48.160 --> 11:50.040
war in neighboring Yemen.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.760
Now, this conflict is widely understood as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.520
Iran is supporting the Houthi rebels, Saudi Arabia the former central government, worried

11:59.520 --> 12:04.200
that a Houthi-led Yemen would function as a satellite state of Iran—an untenable proposition

12:04.200 --> 12:06.080
given their massive land porter.

12:06.080 --> 12:10.760
Therefore, the Houthis regularly undertake attacks on Saudi Arabia, as they did in this

12:10.760 --> 12:14.480
case on an oil depot on the outskirts of Jeddah.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.520
Immediately, a drivers' union meeting was called to discuss whether they'd forced

12:18.520 --> 12:23.720
the cancellation of the race, and reportedly, the initial consensus was yes.

12:23.720 --> 12:27.320
In the minutes and hours that followed, a rotating cast of team principals, Formula

12:27.320 --> 12:31.440
1 executives, Saudi Arabian officials, and others came through the room, convincing drivers

12:31.440 --> 12:35.760
of the strength of air defense systems around the track, and supposedly discussing the quote

12:35.760 --> 12:39.280
consequences of the race not going ahead as planned.

12:39.280 --> 12:44.160
Meanwhile, discussion erupted on social media, as pictures emerged from the endless drivers'

12:44.160 --> 12:48.240
meeting, and much of it was over why the race would be threatened by a drone attack in the

12:48.240 --> 12:49.660
first place.

12:49.660 --> 12:54.240
In the end, after four and a half hours stretching into the early morning, drivers relented and

12:54.240 --> 12:58.800
the race went ahead as planned, but once again, the spotlight shone on Saudi Arabia

12:58.800 --> 13:01.960
and the picture wasn't pretty.

13:01.960 --> 13:06.160
The Kingdom has been widely condemned for its role in what the UN describes as the world's

13:06.160 --> 13:08.280
worst humanitarian crisis, in Yemen.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.800
They've imposed an air and sea blockade on the country that has contributed to the

13:11.800 --> 13:15.560
deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians due to famine.

13:15.560 --> 13:19.120
According to Human Rights Watch, there is also a pattern of Saudi-led strikes on civilian

13:19.120 --> 13:24.220
areas or on military targets in densely populated areas where civilian casualties are inevitable

13:24.220 --> 13:27.660
—both of which are a violation of the laws of war.

13:27.660 --> 13:32.520
The Saudi coalition has also engaged in so-called double-tapping, where one airstrike is conducted

13:32.520 --> 13:37.900
then another is later done in the same spot on those that come to aid the injured.

13:37.900 --> 13:42.660
But Saudi Arabia's repressiveness is not best defined by its war crimes.

13:42.660 --> 13:47.700
After all, tragically, they are hardly the only nation conducting such attacks.

13:47.700 --> 13:52.300
There is wide understanding that a number of developed Middle Eastern nations are repressive,

13:52.300 --> 13:54.200
by Western standards.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.320
Nations like Qatar and the UAE are known for the dissonance between their flashy, westernized

13:58.320 --> 14:01.100
cityscapes and their limited human rights.

14:01.100 --> 14:05.520
Both engage in widespread modern slavery, both severely limit women's rights, both

14:05.520 --> 14:10.180
heavily restrict freedom of speech and the press, both have zero LGBT rights and police

14:10.180 --> 14:16.120
forces that regularly abuse and torture queer people, the list goes on and on.

14:16.120 --> 14:20.800
But even compared to this, Saudi Arabia isn't a league of its own.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.080
Whereas Qatar and the UAE have laws on the books criminalizing homosexuality but rarely

14:25.080 --> 14:30.320
enforce them, Saudi Arabia does—regularly punishing with prison sentences, lashes, and

14:30.320 --> 14:32.000
even execution.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.040
Whereas Qatar restricts access by women to certain venues and the UAE forbids women from

14:36.040 --> 14:40.640
initiating divorce without court order, Saudi Arabia still operates under a strict guardianship

14:40.640 --> 14:45.120
system where women must obtain approval from a male guardian for certain rights.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.960
For example, women of all ages need their guardian's approval to marry, and once married

14:49.960 --> 14:54.540
women are legally required to remain quote, obedient to their husband, even to the extent

14:54.540 --> 14:57.840
of not refusing sex without a quote, legitimate excuse.

14:57.840 --> 15:02.280
But the nation's brutality can't even be fully described in such a comparative manner

15:02.280 --> 15:07.520
because a key tenet of it is the fact that Saudi Arabia barely has codified laws.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.860
Judges sentence based on ambiguous and changing interpretations of Sharia law, which is based

15:11.860 --> 15:16.720
on the Qur'an, but that means people are regularly sentenced, even to death, for ambiguous,

15:16.720 --> 15:21.520
unprovable crimes leading to wide-scaled, institutionalized jailing and killing of those

15:21.520 --> 15:26.560
who dare challenge the ruling royal family's reign in any way.

15:26.560 --> 15:31.080
According to Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World survey, the nation is, by a sizable

15:31.080 --> 15:35.220
margin, the least free nation in the world to be so wealthy.

15:35.220 --> 15:39.000
That puts the nation in a unique situation from a branding perspective.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.660
All of these nations, the other wealthiest in the world, get wealthy world things like

15:43.660 --> 15:46.680
golf and WWE and Formula One.

15:46.680 --> 15:51.620
And while far from perfect, these other nations are on balance far less repressive than Saudi

15:51.620 --> 15:52.620
Arabia.

15:52.620 --> 15:56.740
Therefore, when people's primary exposure to the nation is through wealthy world entertainment

15:56.740 --> 16:01.860
franchises, it's only natural to assume that Saudi Arabia is similar to the UAE or

16:01.860 --> 16:04.380
United Kingdom or UK.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.780
But Phil Mickelson, at least, recognized just how problematic the Saudi regime was when

16:08.780 --> 16:12.260
he noted their role in human rights abuse and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

16:12.860 --> 16:17.060
And the PGA Tour proved well-aware, too, as time and time again, they've brought up

16:17.060 --> 16:21.820
Saudi Arabia's role in 9-11 during their public battle against Liv for hearts, minds,

16:21.820 --> 16:23.180
and golfers.

16:23.180 --> 16:28.700
But money simply proved too much for Mickelson in 2021, and in the summer of 2023, the PGA

16:28.700 --> 16:32.900
Tour found itself in the same position as the golfer.

16:32.900 --> 16:38.580
On June 6th, the PGA Tour announced something that not a single one of its players saw coming.

16:38.580 --> 16:41.060
It was merging with Liv.

16:41.060 --> 16:46.240
The two leagues would quit poaching one another's players, they'd drop the lawsuits and counter-lawsuits,

16:46.240 --> 16:51.200
and the Saudi Public Investment Fund would be the exclusive investor in the merged tour.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.940
It was a complete shock.

16:53.940 --> 16:57.500
It was bigger than golf, bigger than sports.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.400
Following the announcement, Commissioner Monaghan, who had railed against the atrocities committed

17:01.400 --> 17:06.380
by Saudi Arabia, offered a statement trying to justify the deal while 9-11 families, golfers

17:06.380 --> 17:10.340
who had turned down tens of millions on principles that Monaghan had outlined, and the wider

17:10.340 --> 17:13.940
world quickly called him and the tour hypocrites.

17:13.940 --> 17:18.860
Monaghan was a hypocrite, but ultimately, from a business perspective, he was likely

17:18.860 --> 17:20.460
right to concede.

17:20.460 --> 17:25.340
In the coming days, it became clear that Monaghan had understood this for a while, telling tour

17:25.340 --> 17:28.460
employees that they couldn't compete with a foreign government with unlimited money

17:28.460 --> 17:33.180
in a private meeting, and started the process of negotiating some months earlier.

17:33.180 --> 17:38.380
The merger was at once indefensible and inevitable, because neither money nor profitability were

17:38.380 --> 17:41.900
the reason for Saudi Arabia's entrance into professional golf.

17:41.900 --> 17:47.740
Liv, with hardly a TV deal or any real path to profitability, would simply outlast the

17:47.740 --> 17:49.300
PGA Tour.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.800
With an estimated $50 million spent in legal fees and $100 million spent on bigger purses

17:53.800 --> 17:59.860
and player bonuses, PGA Tour reserves had begun to run dry by early 2022, and the only

17:59.860 --> 18:05.260
recourse was to give the sovereign wealth fund what it really wanted—a seat at the

18:05.260 --> 18:06.820
table.

18:06.820 --> 18:11.820
With every additional overlap between professional sports and Saudi Arabia, global media speculates

18:11.820 --> 18:14.380
on what the nation's intentions truly are.

18:14.380 --> 18:19.540
It's not money, at least not now, as they're spending far more than could ever return to

18:19.540 --> 18:21.820
develop their profile of professional sports.

18:21.820 --> 18:27.200
It's also not the short-term image effects, as often suggested, since for as much as Formula

18:27.200 --> 18:33.220
One or WWE or Liv imply a level of legitimacy for the nation, they also highlight its repressiveness

18:33.220 --> 18:34.420
and regressiveness.

18:34.420 --> 18:39.860
It's only natural—the nation is repressive and regressive, so when you bring international

18:39.860 --> 18:43.940
cameras and journalists an attention that can't be stymied by intimidation, arrest,

18:43.940 --> 18:48.700
and imprisonment as domestic equivalents can, inevitably the world is going to hear about

18:48.700 --> 18:49.700
the nation's issues.

18:49.700 --> 18:55.220
And when the global consensus is that legitimizing Saudi Arabia through sports is a bad idea,

18:55.220 --> 18:59.780
stories or even rumors proving that point are only going to be amplified further.

18:59.780 --> 19:05.540
But it's ultimately quite tough to evaluate decision-making in an absolute monarchy.

19:05.540 --> 19:10.620
At the end of the day, maybe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman just really likes sports,

19:10.620 --> 19:14.820
or maybe he just wants fun events for him and his wealthy friends, or maybe there's

19:14.820 --> 19:19.020
not much strategy at all behind this foray into professional sports since even the billions

19:19.020 --> 19:23.780
being spent on it are a paltry sum compared to the scale of royal family wealth in Saudi

19:23.780 --> 19:25.540
Arabia.

19:25.540 --> 19:29.820
Perhaps the most cohesive explanation, though, is that this isn't some short-term branding

19:29.820 --> 19:30.820
exercise.

19:30.820 --> 19:34.220
The Kingdom isn't expecting the world to think positively about it just because they

19:34.220 --> 19:36.020
put on some decent golf.

19:36.020 --> 19:42.060
Rather, this seems one small part of the nation's massive reorientation.

19:42.060 --> 19:48.620
Saudi Arabia is trying very, very hard to set itself up for a post-oil era.

19:48.620 --> 19:54.500
In doing so, it's trying very, very hard to become a place like Dubai—a diversified,

19:54.500 --> 19:58.660
modern, service-based Middle Eastern economy as integrated with the world as Singapore

19:58.660 --> 19:59.660
or Sao Paulo.

19:59.660 --> 20:04.420
It's trying to end its era of isolation and become a player in international affairs

20:04.420 --> 20:09.420
as the era of insularity funded by oil exports draws closer to a close.

20:09.420 --> 20:13.720
This is a practical necessity for the ruling family, since the tolerance of their grip

20:13.720 --> 20:18.620
on power has been undergirded by the prosperity brought to the nation during their reign.

20:18.620 --> 20:23.740
If this prosperity fails to maintain into a post-oil era, so too might the monarchy

20:23.740 --> 20:25.700
itself.

20:25.700 --> 20:30.740
As part of this, genuine reform is happening—many of the nation's most repressive policies

20:30.740 --> 20:33.780
are no longer, but mostly the most visible ones.

20:33.780 --> 20:38.180
The indiscriminate arrest, jailing, torture, and execution of dissidents and activists

20:38.180 --> 20:39.860
still occur.

20:39.860 --> 20:44.100
The absence of democracy is still unchanged.

20:44.100 --> 20:48.180
Saudi Arabia's are dominating the conversation about Saudi Arabia, but they're also creating

20:48.180 --> 20:49.180
conversation.

20:49.180 --> 20:53.940
They're not necessarily supposed to be immediately and directly effective at rebranding the nation.

20:53.940 --> 20:56.780
Rather, they're part of the long game.

20:56.780 --> 21:01.820
WWE or Formula One or professional golf just embed themselves with other parts of the wealthy

21:01.820 --> 21:03.740
world naturally.

21:03.740 --> 21:08.460
Saudi Arabia, as it makes its transition out of insularity, needs to force it.

21:08.460 --> 21:11.340
They're faking it until they make it.

21:11.980 --> 21:15.540
So the question asked every time they make an additional encroachment into sports is

21:15.540 --> 21:19.820
whether it's right to help Saudi Arabia fake it before they've made it—before

21:19.820 --> 21:24.420
they've genuinely turned themselves into a place that respects human rights.

21:24.420 --> 21:29.320
Sports executives constantly argue that the order of operations is right—that engagement

21:29.320 --> 21:34.260
with Western culture will propagate Western principles of human rights—but through this,

21:34.260 --> 21:38.420
these executives are making a massive gamble on whether they'll land on the right side

21:38.420 --> 21:39.780
of history.

21:39.780 --> 21:44.300
Because the other option is that their executive bonuses are being based on their culpability

21:44.300 --> 21:49.580
in branding the nation as a place that respects human rights without them actually doing so—because,

21:49.580 --> 21:54.720
after all, the best possible future for Saudi's rulers is that they get to continue their

21:54.720 --> 22:01.740
autocratic ways while being perceived and treated by the Western world as a normal place.

22:01.740 --> 22:03.720
The world has problems.

22:03.720 --> 22:08.060
In many cases, because power is concentrated and held by a small number of individuals

22:08.060 --> 22:12.160
who happen to be the same people who are best able to profit from problems.

22:12.160 --> 22:15.960
But despite that, these same problems get solved by the actions of those who have devoted

22:15.960 --> 22:17.620
their lives to solving them.

22:17.620 --> 22:22.240
If you're worried about the threat of AI or pandemics or nuclear bombs or global wars

22:22.240 --> 22:26.700
or climate change, you truly can make an impact in solving these problems by doing what you're

22:26.700 --> 22:27.700
