1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,820
The opening shot of Golf Civil War came in the form of a press release.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,340
Published on a Friday in late October of 2021, the newly formed company, Liv Golf Investments,

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,580
with the backing of the Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund, announced its commitment of $200 million

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:21,380
to establish 10 new marquee professional golf tournaments.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,500
It also announced its new CEO, the brash Australian, the former world number one golfer, the shark

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Greg Norman.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,940
And it announced, well, little else.

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,900
Who would play, where they'd play, and exactly how these tournaments would be played were

9
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,820
details for a later date.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,620
Instead, the release opted for platitudes and an ominous promise—that this was only

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,300
the beginning.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,980
For other established sports leagues, it might be easy to write off the arrival of such an

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,500
overly vague and optimistic challenger.

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,340
The established leagues have the money, they have the TV deals, and most importantly, they

15
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,620
have the talent.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,500
The PGA Tour, the most prestigious golf circuit in the world, however, is a little different.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,620
While it has the money and TV deals, it doesn't pay for the luxury of keeping its talent locked

18
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,140
down.

19
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,620
Whereas most professional sports leagues pay their players consistent base salaries with

20
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,260
the occasional incentive looped into a contract, the PGA Tour only pays for winning.

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,060
For the world's very best, this works just fine—show up to a third or maybe a half

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,220
of the 40-something annual PGA tournaments, post a score good enough to land in the money

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,560
or even win outright, bring home the winnings, and cash in on the media attention through

24
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,780
endorsement deals.

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,940
But this creates a problem for those in the middle and back of the pack—elite golfers

26
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,520
in their own right, but golfers who are paying for their own travel, coaching, and accommodations

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,580
only to quite possibly finish outside the money if they don't play to their full potential.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,040
All this is to say, the PGA Tour and its pay structure, along with its stuffy, hesitant-to-change

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,000
culture was ripe for a challenge—and they knew it as well as anyone.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,120
The counter to the live announcement came from the tour's wary commissioner, Jay Monahan,

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,920
who sent each tour member a memo explaining they were sweetening the pot.

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,960
For the upcoming season, there'd be more prize money at tournaments, more money devoted

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,000
to the player impact program that compensates for their roles in boosting the tour's engagement,

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,800
and that there'd be an entirely new bonus fund for players appearing in 15 or more PGA

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
events.

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,560
If the carrot wasn't enough, there was also the stick.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,040
Along with more money, Monahan also warned that if players defected to whatever this

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,900
new league was, they'd be banned from playing in the PGA Tour.

39
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,800
For one of golf's biggest names, and one of the PGA's highest earners, the carrot

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,740
wasn't enough, and the stick was just another example of an organization with too much power.

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,500
Following Monahan's counter, Phil Mickelson, the longtime fan favorite, the lovable lefty

42
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,280
who just so happened to be playing in the Saudi international tournament, took the time

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,080
in an interview about his future to point out that the PGA Tour's greed had reached

44
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
obnoxious proportions—that their hoarding of players' digital media rights worth millions,

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,680
among other things, was pushing players to look for new places to play.

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,920
While he didn't say that he had found a new place to play, the writing was on the

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,920
wall.

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,440
Secession was in the air.

49
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,120
Back in the States, the tour went on.

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,560
But at each stop, the tension built, rumors circulated on who was making the jump, and

51
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:23,000
ever so quietly, offers of guaranteed contracts in the tens of millions began making their

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,800
way to top players.

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,520
Then suddenly, as the golf world descended on the Riviera Golf Course in California's

54
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,200
Pacific Palisades for the Genesis Open, a bombshell article rocked the sports world,

55
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,240
nearly collapsing the Saudi coup before it even really took shape.

56
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,920
With his new biography on Mickelson available for pre-order, and the media buzz over the

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,300
mysterious Saudi Challenger building, Alan Shipnick felt the timing was right to pull

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,940
back the curtain.

59
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,240
Mickelson was, in fact, working with the startup Saudi League, having already recruited three

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,900
other top players to make the flip.

61
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,680
But of bigger consequence, Mickelson was aware of the bigger picture, too.

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,940
He called the league nothing more than sports-washing, he called the Saudis scary, and he made no

63
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,760
qualms about the fact that the move was about nothing more than money and leverage.

64
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,660
In the story's wake, golfers now had to make their intentions clear to fans and media—were

65
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,220
they so focused on the money they'd overlook Saudi Arabian atrocities like the money-obsessed

66
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,020
Mickelson?

67
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:27,040
Some stayed coy, alluding to or outright mentioning that they'd sign NDAs, effectively signaling

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,620
that they were likely deep in negotiations with Liv or had already come to an agreement.

69
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,860
But most, especially golf's biggest names who were rumored targets of Liv, went out

70
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,420
of their way to align themselves with the PGA Tour and to disparage the Saudi-backed

71
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,720
Challenger.

72
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Before anyone really knew what it would be, the Saudi project seemed dead.

73
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,440
Mickelson stepped away from golf for the moment, and the world moved on.

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,820
Then, Greg Norman announced the Liv Golf Invitational—eight tournaments, five of which not halfway across

75
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:05,520
the world, but in the US, an eye-watering $255 million in prize money for a field of

76
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,320
only 48 players, and a format that had golfers only playing three rounds rather than four.

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,440
Essentially, it was a tour with convenient locations, lower stress, less competition,

78
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,880
and prize money that, on a tournament-by-tournament basis, would usually more than double what

79
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,400
the PGA Tour offered.

80
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,560
It was a tour whose leader was one of golf's most famous figureheads, it was a tour that

81
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
conveniently distanced itself from its Saudi Arabian roots in locations and branding, and

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,560
it was a tour that injected more money into the sport than anyone could have imagined.

83
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,560
For its part, the PGA Tour thought it was in the clear—they had already dangled the

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,360
carrot, outlined potential punishment, and after benefiting from Mickelson putting his

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,920
foot in his mouth, they simply couldn't be bothered—they had moved on.

86
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,600
Players, though, began to reconsider.

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,480
One by one, they decided that perhaps it wasn't too toxic of a public relations move to join

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:00,800
the tour, or that the money was, at least, more valuable than the image hit.

89
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,140
Dustin Johnson was the first big name to turn on his early promise to back the PGA, signing

90
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:13,220
for $125 million to flip allegiances and resigning his PGA membership.

91
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,460
Then, at the very first live tournament, the benefits of defecting became all the more

92
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,120
obvious as Charles Schwartzl, a lower-profile PGA Tour player who hadn't finished first

93
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:29,560
in a tour event in six years, ended up winning a cool $4.75 million.

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,620
Not long after, DeChambeau too countered his previous statements and joined the Saudi-backed

95
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,300
tour, then came Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith, two of golf's brightest stars.

96
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,580
Golf's Civil War, the one the PGA Tour thought it had already won, was a back-on, with the

97
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,900
Saudi side flipping the battlefield with nothing more than a massive influx of cash.

98
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,620
Live, however, is far from Saudi Arabia's first foray into professional sports.

99
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,140
This is World Wrestling Entertainment's 2022 schedule of pay-per-view events.

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,740
While WWE packs a non-stop calendar of TV shows and non-televised events, these specials

101
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,360
are the ones you hear about—the biggest moneymakers for the entertainment company.

102
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,060
They feature the biggest stars—Roman Reigns, Hulk Hogan, Brock Lesnar, John Cena, The Undertaker—and

103
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,980
the biggest plot points in the series' ongoing scripted narrative.

104
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,300
Correspondingly, they are rare.

105
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,100
2022 saw 17 across the year, just three of which occurring outside the US—September's

106
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,900
Clash at the Castle in Wales, while the two other international events were held in Jeddah

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,740
and Riyadh.

108
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,420
Searching through the company's quarterly reports, it's no wonder why.

109
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,500
Every few quarters, the media revenue attributed to the other category shoots up by about $50

110
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,220
million.

111
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,880
Dating back to 2018, the quarters when this happens corresponds exactly to when the company

112
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,420
hosts an event in Saudi Arabia—it even drops out when events were cancelled due to COVID.

113
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:01,380
This has led to an understanding that Saudi Arabia is paying the company about $50 million

114
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,500
per event.

115
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Scanning down and to the right puts that into perspective—with a mere two per year summing

116
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,420
to a massive $100 million, these Saudi events are responsible for close to 10% of the annual

117
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:19,300
revenue of the world's 37th most valuable entertainment company.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,840
And they've been popular.

119
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,700
After all, the scripted nature of WWE allows the company to guarantee it.

120
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,720
At the 2022 event in Wales, Clash at the Castle, many speculated that reigning champion Roman

121
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,380
Reigns would be set to lose to Scottish contender Drew McIntyre because the Scottish underdog

122
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,160
winning against the American champion is exactly what the European fans would want to see,

123
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,320
and traditionally, the entertainment company scripts their storylines to entertain their

124
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,360
fans.

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,960
But in this case, the customer was Saudi Arabia, and in order to guarantee the reigning champion

126
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,880
would fight up-and-coming star Logan Paul in Riyadh that November, a fight that was

127
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,440
sure to generate massive attention, Roman Reigns had to win in Wales.

128
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,120
But the drama outside the arena was far more real.

129
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,040
Three years prior, the 2019 edition of the same Crown Jewel event failed to air live

130
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
as scheduled in its host country.

131
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,040
There is still no official explanation for this, but there are plenty of rumors.

132
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,020
They go that the Saudi government was late on a $60 million payment for the prior event.

133
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,080
That part is corroborated in financial reports, and either to force their hand or in retribution,

134
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,040
WWE briefly cut off the fee to the Saudi local broadcaster.

135
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,120
Ultimately, the event did make it to broadcast in its host country with a one-hour tape delay,

136
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,920
but then WWE faced its own issues.

137
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,920
As 200 performers and personnel gathered for their 3AM charter flight to Buffalo, New York,

138
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,780
where the company's flagship Monday Night Raw show is being filmed, flight crew started

139
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:53,900
to announce delay after delay after delay with no real explanation for why.

140
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,720
One anonymous wrestler later testified in a lawsuit against WWE, stating that the doors

141
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,400
of the plane were blocked by armed guards and black militia attire, and that a crewmember

142
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,080
stated, it seems someone doesn't want us to leave the country.

143
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,040
The wrestler also said the company's senior director of talent relations told him that

144
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,480
the payment's dispute had truly occurred, that the fee was cut, and that the Saudi Crown

145
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,900
Prince was quote, very mad.

146
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,800
This interpretation of the events led many to describe it as a hostage incident—that

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,560
Saudi Arabia failed to allow the plane to take off, to get back at WWE.

148
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,340
Now, this testimony is only one small part of a larger suit alleging that WWE misrepresented

149
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,440
broadcast rights negotiations with the Saudi government to its investors, but despite their

150
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,520
best efforts, WWE could not get this lawsuit dismissed and settled for $39 million.

151
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,480
Not an admission of guilt, but at least an indication that it was too difficult to disprove

152
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,700
the claims.

153
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,840
Of course, WWE has vehemently denied rumors of this so-called hostage incident, claiming

154
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,720
that it was just mechanical issues.

155
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,360
Wrestlers, meanwhile, have been tight-lipped and vague when talking about it—potentially

156
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,760
wary to threaten their highly lucrative contracts with the company.

157
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,600
But in this case, the facts hardly matter to Saudi Arabia, because the public believes

158
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
it.

159
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,240
The country turned the spotlight on itself, and in return, a story emerged that only shaped

160
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,360
the uninformed's understanding of how the country, and its ruling royals, operates.

161
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,420
And it's hardly the only time this has happened.

162
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,680
In 2022, the second-ever Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, a stop on Formula One's globe-spanning

163
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
calendar, was overshadowed by a massive plume of smoke in the background.

164
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,560
This was visible during the Friday's practice sessions, but as on-track action finished

165
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,640
up for the night, reports emerged that this wasn't a simple fire—it was an attack.

166
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,160
More specifically, it was an attack by Houthi rebels who fight one side of the ongoing civil

167
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,040
war in neighboring Yemen.

168
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,760
Now, this conflict is widely understood as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

169
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,520
Iran is supporting the Houthi rebels, Saudi Arabia the former central government, worried

170
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,200
that a Houthi-led Yemen would function as a satellite state of Iran—an untenable proposition

171
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,080
given their massive land porter.

172
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,760
Therefore, the Houthis regularly undertake attacks on Saudi Arabia, as they did in this

173
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,480
case on an oil depot on the outskirts of Jeddah.

174
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,520
Immediately, a drivers' union meeting was called to discuss whether they'd forced

175
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,720
the cancellation of the race, and reportedly, the initial consensus was yes.

176
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,320
In the minutes and hours that followed, a rotating cast of team principals, Formula

177
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,440
1 executives, Saudi Arabian officials, and others came through the room, convincing drivers

178
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,760
of the strength of air defense systems around the track, and supposedly discussing the quote

179
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,280
consequences of the race not going ahead as planned.

180
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,160
Meanwhile, discussion erupted on social media, as pictures emerged from the endless drivers'

181
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,240
meeting, and much of it was over why the race would be threatened by a drone attack in the

182
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,660
first place.

183
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,240
In the end, after four and a half hours stretching into the early morning, drivers relented and

184
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,800
the race went ahead as planned, but once again, the spotlight shone on Saudi Arabia

185
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,960
and the picture wasn't pretty.

186
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,160
The Kingdom has been widely condemned for its role in what the UN describes as the world's

187
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,280
worst humanitarian crisis, in Yemen.

188
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,800
They've imposed an air and sea blockade on the country that has contributed to the

189
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,560
deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians due to famine.

190
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,120
According to Human Rights Watch, there is also a pattern of Saudi-led strikes on civilian

191
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,220
areas or on military targets in densely populated areas where civilian casualties are inevitable

192
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,660
—both of which are a violation of the laws of war.

193
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,520
The Saudi coalition has also engaged in so-called double-tapping, where one airstrike is conducted

194
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:37,900
then another is later done in the same spot on those that come to aid the injured.

195
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,660
But Saudi Arabia's repressiveness is not best defined by its war crimes.

196
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,700
After all, tragically, they are hardly the only nation conducting such attacks.

197
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,300
There is wide understanding that a number of developed Middle Eastern nations are repressive,

198
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,200
by Western standards.

199
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,320
Nations like Qatar and the UAE are known for the dissonance between their flashy, westernized

200
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,100
cityscapes and their limited human rights.

201
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,520
Both engage in widespread modern slavery, both severely limit women's rights, both

202
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,180
heavily restrict freedom of speech and the press, both have zero LGBT rights and police

203
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,120
forces that regularly abuse and torture queer people, the list goes on and on.

204
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,800
But even compared to this, Saudi Arabia isn't a league of its own.

205
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,080
Whereas Qatar and the UAE have laws on the books criminalizing homosexuality but rarely

206
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,320
enforce them, Saudi Arabia does—regularly punishing with prison sentences, lashes, and

207
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,000
even execution.

208
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,040
Whereas Qatar restricts access by women to certain venues and the UAE forbids women from

209
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,640
initiating divorce without court order, Saudi Arabia still operates under a strict guardianship

210
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,120
system where women must obtain approval from a male guardian for certain rights.

211
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,960
For example, women of all ages need their guardian's approval to marry, and once married

212
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,540
women are legally required to remain quote, obedient to their husband, even to the extent

213
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,840
of not refusing sex without a quote, legitimate excuse.

214
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,280
But the nation's brutality can't even be fully described in such a comparative manner

215
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:07,520
because a key tenet of it is the fact that Saudi Arabia barely has codified laws.

216
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,860
Judges sentence based on ambiguous and changing interpretations of Sharia law, which is based

217
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,720
on the Qur'an, but that means people are regularly sentenced, even to death, for ambiguous,

218
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,520
unprovable crimes leading to wide-scaled, institutionalized jailing and killing of those

219
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,560
who dare challenge the ruling royal family's reign in any way.

220
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,080
According to Freedom House's annual Freedom in the World survey, the nation is, by a sizable

221
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,220
margin, the least free nation in the world to be so wealthy.

222
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,000
That puts the nation in a unique situation from a branding perspective.

223
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,660
All of these nations, the other wealthiest in the world, get wealthy world things like

224
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,680
golf and WWE and Formula One.

225
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,620
And while far from perfect, these other nations are on balance far less repressive than Saudi

226
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,620
Arabia.

227
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,740
Therefore, when people's primary exposure to the nation is through wealthy world entertainment

228
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:01,860
franchises, it's only natural to assume that Saudi Arabia is similar to the UAE or

229
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,380
United Kingdom or UK.

230
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,780
But Phil Mickelson, at least, recognized just how problematic the Saudi regime was when

231
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,260
he noted their role in human rights abuse and the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

232
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,060
And the PGA Tour proved well-aware, too, as time and time again, they've brought up

233
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:21,820
Saudi Arabia's role in 9-11 during their public battle against Liv for hearts, minds,

234
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,180
and golfers.

235
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,700
But money simply proved too much for Mickelson in 2021, and in the summer of 2023, the PGA

236
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,900
Tour found itself in the same position as the golfer.

237
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,580
On June 6th, the PGA Tour announced something that not a single one of its players saw coming.

238
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,060
It was merging with Liv.

239
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,240
The two leagues would quit poaching one another's players, they'd drop the lawsuits and counter-lawsuits,

240
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,200
and the Saudi Public Investment Fund would be the exclusive investor in the merged tour.

241
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,940
It was a complete shock.

242
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,500
It was bigger than golf, bigger than sports.

243
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,400
Following the announcement, Commissioner Monaghan, who had railed against the atrocities committed

244
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,380
by Saudi Arabia, offered a statement trying to justify the deal while 9-11 families, golfers

245
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,340
who had turned down tens of millions on principles that Monaghan had outlined, and the wider

246
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,940
world quickly called him and the tour hypocrites.

247
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,860
Monaghan was a hypocrite, but ultimately, from a business perspective, he was likely

248
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,460
right to concede.

249
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,340
In the coming days, it became clear that Monaghan had understood this for a while, telling tour

250
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,460
employees that they couldn't compete with a foreign government with unlimited money

251
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,180
in a private meeting, and started the process of negotiating some months earlier.

252
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,380
The merger was at once indefensible and inevitable, because neither money nor profitability were

253
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,900
the reason for Saudi Arabia's entrance into professional golf.

254
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:47,740
Liv, with hardly a TV deal or any real path to profitability, would simply outlast the

255
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,300
PGA Tour.

256
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,800
With an estimated $50 million spent in legal fees and $100 million spent on bigger purses

257
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,860
and player bonuses, PGA Tour reserves had begun to run dry by early 2022, and the only

258
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,260
recourse was to give the sovereign wealth fund what it really wanted—a seat at the

259
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,820
table.

260
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,820
With every additional overlap between professional sports and Saudi Arabia, global media speculates

261
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,380
on what the nation's intentions truly are.

262
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,540
It's not money, at least not now, as they're spending far more than could ever return to

263
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,820
develop their profile of professional sports.

264
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,200
It's also not the short-term image effects, as often suggested, since for as much as Formula

265
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,220
One or WWE or Liv imply a level of legitimacy for the nation, they also highlight its repressiveness

266
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,420
and regressiveness.

267
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:39,860
It's only natural—the nation is repressive and regressive, so when you bring international

268
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,940
cameras and journalists an attention that can't be stymied by intimidation, arrest,

269
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,700
and imprisonment as domestic equivalents can, inevitably the world is going to hear about

270
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
the nation's issues.

271
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,220
And when the global consensus is that legitimizing Saudi Arabia through sports is a bad idea,

272
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,780
stories or even rumors proving that point are only going to be amplified further.

273
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:05,540
But it's ultimately quite tough to evaluate decision-making in an absolute monarchy.

274
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,620
At the end of the day, maybe Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman just really likes sports,

275
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,820
or maybe he just wants fun events for him and his wealthy friends, or maybe there's

276
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,020
not much strategy at all behind this foray into professional sports since even the billions

277
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,780
being spent on it are a paltry sum compared to the scale of royal family wealth in Saudi

278
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,540
Arabia.

279
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,820
Perhaps the most cohesive explanation, though, is that this isn't some short-term branding

280
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,820
exercise.

281
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:34,220
The Kingdom isn't expecting the world to think positively about it just because they

282
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,020
put on some decent golf.

283
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,060
Rather, this seems one small part of the nation's massive reorientation.

284
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:48,620
Saudi Arabia is trying very, very hard to set itself up for a post-oil era.

285
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,500
In doing so, it's trying very, very hard to become a place like Dubai—a diversified,

286
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,660
modern, service-based Middle Eastern economy as integrated with the world as Singapore

287
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
or Sao Paulo.

288
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,420
It's trying to end its era of isolation and become a player in international affairs

289
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,420
as the era of insularity funded by oil exports draws closer to a close.

290
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,720
This is a practical necessity for the ruling family, since the tolerance of their grip

291
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,620
on power has been undergirded by the prosperity brought to the nation during their reign.

292
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,740
If this prosperity fails to maintain into a post-oil era, so too might the monarchy

293
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,700
itself.

294
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:30,740
As part of this, genuine reform is happening—many of the nation's most repressive policies

295
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,780
are no longer, but mostly the most visible ones.

296
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,180
The indiscriminate arrest, jailing, torture, and execution of dissidents and activists

297
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,860
still occur.

298
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,100
The absence of democracy is still unchanged.

299
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,180
Saudi Arabia's are dominating the conversation about Saudi Arabia, but they're also creating

300
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
conversation.

301
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,940
They're not necessarily supposed to be immediately and directly effective at rebranding the nation.

302
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,780
Rather, they're part of the long game.

303
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,820
WWE or Formula One or professional golf just embed themselves with other parts of the wealthy

304
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,740
world naturally.

305
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,460
Saudi Arabia, as it makes its transition out of insularity, needs to force it.

306
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,340
They're faking it until they make it.

307
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,540
So the question asked every time they make an additional encroachment into sports is

308
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,820
whether it's right to help Saudi Arabia fake it before they've made it—before

309
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:24,420
they've genuinely turned themselves into a place that respects human rights.

310
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:29,320
Sports executives constantly argue that the order of operations is right—that engagement

311
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,260
with Western culture will propagate Western principles of human rights—but through this,

312
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,420
these executives are making a massive gamble on whether they'll land on the right side

313
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,780
of history.

314
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,300
Because the other option is that their executive bonuses are being based on their culpability

315
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,580
in branding the nation as a place that respects human rights without them actually doing so—because,

316
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,720
after all, the best possible future for Saudi's rulers is that they get to continue their

317
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:01,740
autocratic ways while being perceived and treated by the Western world as a normal place.

318
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,720
The world has problems.

319
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,060
In many cases, because power is concentrated and held by a small number of individuals

320
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,160
who happen to be the same people who are best able to profit from problems.

321
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,960
But despite that, these same problems get solved by the actions of those who have devoted

322
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,620
their lives to solving them.

323
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:22,240
If you're worried about the threat of AI or pandemics or nuclear bombs or global wars

324
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,700
or climate change, you truly can make an impact in solving these problems by doing what you're

325
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,700
already doing—working.

326
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,780
