00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
Extremities is back and better than ever, but it's going to be different.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,560
Much has changed since the last season of the Extremities podcast.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,560
Travel screeched to a halt, and with this standstill went my ability to visit, document,

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,000
and share the stories of faraway places.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,360
Yet, through all the changes and tumult brought on by the last 18 months, some things have

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,360
stayed quite the same.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,000
Thankfully, telling stories of the world's most remote settlements remained a core interest

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,120
of mine.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,520
And so, while serving the same purpose—to access and explain the isolated and difficult-to-comprehend

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,720
corners of the globe—Extremities is returning, but in a new form, and this time, you're

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,400
going to need a screen.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,840
Extremities is relaunching as a standalone YouTube channel.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,500
For those of you curious as to how a civil war influences one of the most biodiverse

14
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,780
islands on the planet, how French culture perpetuates in the subantarctic, and why centuries-old

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,460
Atlantic island communities have been all but abandoned over the course of just a few

16
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,740
decades, come on over to the Extremities channel right now and give it a watch.

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,020
The first two videos are up now, the third will go up in a week, or it's on Nebula

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,380
Now, and then more will go out every third Wednesday after that.

19
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:19,900
Each video features interviews with locals and experts alike, taking you to the place,

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,900
introducing you to its people, and telling its story.

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,620
Ad-free episodes, along with extended cuts of interviews, will also be available for

22
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,620
Nebula subscribers.

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,100
