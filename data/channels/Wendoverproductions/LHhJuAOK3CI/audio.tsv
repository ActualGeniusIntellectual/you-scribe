0	5920	Extremities is back and better than ever, but it's going to be different.
5920	10560	Much has changed since the last season of the Extremities podcast.
10560	15560	Travel screeched to a halt, and with this standstill went my ability to visit, document,
15560	18000	and share the stories of faraway places.
18000	23360	Yet, through all the changes and tumult brought on by the last 18 months, some things have
23360	25360	stayed quite the same.
25360	30000	Thankfully, telling stories of the world's most remote settlements remained a core interest
30000	31120	of mine.
31120	36520	And so, while serving the same purpose—to access and explain the isolated and difficult-to-comprehend
36520	42720	corners of the globe—Extremities is returning, but in a new form, and this time, you're
42720	44400	going to need a screen.
44400	48840	Extremities is relaunching as a standalone YouTube channel.
48840	52500	For those of you curious as to how a civil war influences one of the most biodiverse
52500	57780	islands on the planet, how French culture perpetuates in the subantarctic, and why centuries-old
57780	61460	Atlantic island communities have been all but abandoned over the course of just a few
61460	66740	decades, come on over to the Extremities channel right now and give it a watch.
66740	71020	The first two videos are up now, the third will go up in a week, or it's on Nebula
71020	75380	Now, and then more will go out every third Wednesday after that.
75380	79900	Each video features interviews with locals and experts alike, taking you to the place,
79900	83900	introducing you to its people, and telling its story.
83900	87620	Ad-free episodes, along with extended cuts of interviews, will also be available for
87620	88620	Nebula subscribers.
88620	93100	So head to this link, clickable at the top of the description, to watch and subscribe
93100	95740	to Wendover Productions' newest channel.
