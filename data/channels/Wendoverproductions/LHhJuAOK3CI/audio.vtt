Extremities is back and better than ever, but it's going to be different.

00:05.920 --> 00:10.560
Much has changed since the last season of the Extremities podcast.

00:10.560 --> 00:15.560
Travel screeched to a halt, and with this standstill went my ability to visit, document,

00:15.560 --> 00:18.000
and share the stories of faraway places.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.360
Yet, through all the changes and tumult brought on by the last 18 months, some things have

00:23.360 --> 00:25.360
stayed quite the same.

00:25.360 --> 00:30.000
Thankfully, telling stories of the world's most remote settlements remained a core interest

00:30.000 --> 00:31.120
of mine.

00:31.120 --> 00:36.520
And so, while serving the same purpose—to access and explain the isolated and difficult-to-comprehend

00:36.520 --> 00:42.720
corners of the globe—Extremities is returning, but in a new form, and this time, you're

00:42.720 --> 00:44.400
going to need a screen.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.840
Extremities is relaunching as a standalone YouTube channel.

00:48.840 --> 00:52.500
For those of you curious as to how a civil war influences one of the most biodiverse

00:52.500 --> 00:57.780
islands on the planet, how French culture perpetuates in the subantarctic, and why centuries-old

00:57.780 --> 01:01.460
Atlantic island communities have been all but abandoned over the course of just a few

01:01.460 --> 01:06.740
decades, come on over to the Extremities channel right now and give it a watch.

01:06.740 --> 01:11.020
The first two videos are up now, the third will go up in a week, or it's on Nebula

01:11.020 --> 01:15.380
Now, and then more will go out every third Wednesday after that.

01:15.380 --> 01:19.900
Each video features interviews with locals and experts alike, taking you to the place,

01:19.900 --> 01:23.900
introducing you to its people, and telling its story.

01:23.900 --> 01:27.620
Ad-free episodes, along with extended cuts of interviews, will also be available for

01:27.620 --> 01:28.620
Nebula subscribers.

01:28.620 --> 01:33.100
So head to this link, clickable at the top of the description, to watch and subscribe

01:33.100 --> 01:35.740
to Wendover Productions' newest channel.
