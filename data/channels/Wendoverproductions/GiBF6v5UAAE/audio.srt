3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,880
China is a country both blessed and cursed by geography.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,640
On one hand its land has allowed for the country to grow to almost 1.4 billion people but on

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,940
the other hand it really doesn't have great geographical protection.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,840
The beginning of what most people call Chinese history often starts with the Yellow River

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,480
civilization and there's a good reason why this settlement grew into the most populous

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,200
country in the world.

9
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,800
The floodplain of the Yellow River is some of the best agricultural land in the world.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,620
In fact, the entirety of eastern China is perfectly suited for agriculture.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,160
This was and still is crucial to the country's success.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,040
What's more, this area is just warm and wet enough that farmers can do what is known

13
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,560
as double cropping.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,240
Once the main crop of rice is cultivated in June and July, another slightly less productive

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,320
crop can be planted for October cultivation.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,560
This increases rice output by about 25% which means China can make more food using the same

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
amount of land.

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,100
Europe mostly relies on wheat to feed its population which only outputs 4 million calories

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,400
of food per acre of farmland.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,640
Rice on the other hand, grows 11 million calories worth per acre.

21
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,080
It's easy to see why there are so many people in China.

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,760
But China does have its geographical challenges.

23
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,840
To the south it borders three countries—Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.

24
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,420
The borders between these three countries and China seem almost arbitrarily set because

25
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,880
they sort of were.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,820
Vietnam's was set after the Sino-French War, Laos' was set following its involvement

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,000
in the Vietnam War, and Myanmar's was set following a small war with China in the 60's.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,000
None was naturally set by the environment—all were chosen arbitrarily by humans at war.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,320
These countries are not insignificant.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Combined they have nearly 1 million active military personnel while China, the much larger

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,920
country, has just over 2 million.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,600
Significant conflict with any of these countries would not be a one-sided war.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,800
While China would have the technological advantage, any of these three countries would have a

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,160
significant home field advantage.

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,560
Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar are all jungle countries—one of the most difficult environments

36
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,600
for warfare.

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,880
This was part of the reason why the Vietnam War lasted so long.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,520
It's just so hard to move troops in the jungle so everything slows down.

39
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,740
Without any geographical protection of its borders, it would be significantly easier

40
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,320
for Vietnam, Laos, or Myanmar to invade China than the reverse.

41
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,000
But China does have an advantage elsewhere.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,880
China and India just aren't good friends.

43
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,680
They have border disputes, military conflicts, political differences, so it's just hard

44
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,980
for them to get along and that's why Tibet is so important.

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,880
Tibet was historically its own empire.

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,960
It was only in the last 300 years that China took it over.

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,480
Tibetan people are ethnically different than the Han Chinese inhabiting China's east.

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,160
It just doesn't make sense for Tibet to be part of China, except militarily.

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:16,240
Only 0.2% of China's population lives in Tibet which accounts for nearly 13% of the

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
country's area.

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,840
More people live in the inner four districts of Beijing than the entirety of Tibet.

52
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,840
It's just incredibly desolate, but it serves a purpose.

53
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,160
If China didn't rule Tibet then India would.

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,040
Maybe not formally, but there's little chance that an independent Tibet would not be economically

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,720
and culturally dominated by either India or China.

56
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,000
It just doesn't have enough power economically or militarily to resist, but in China's

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,120
view it could not and cannot allow for an Indian Tibet.

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,840
Indian rule of Tibet would mean that there would be no geographical protection between

59
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,520
the populated area of China and India because Tibet is that geographical protection.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,620
Not only does Tibet extend China's border to the Himalayas, it's also an unpopulated

61
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,340
area without the transportation infrastructure needed for an invading India to advance a

62
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,500
large number of troops towards eastern China.

63
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,220
But that also means that there's not the transportation infrastructure necessary for

64
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,220
China to advance towards India, but China is trying to change that.

65
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,460
They recently opened the world's highest railroad to Tibet, they're building highways

66
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:27,320
constantly, and they also opened a large airport in Yingxi just miles away from the border.

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,180
In the near term, the goal of these projects is to further integrate Tibet into China.

68
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,300
The government has all but failed at winning over the native Tibetan population, but they

69
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,780
can change who lives in Tibet.

70
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,180
Hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese have moved into Tibet and many more visit each

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,180
year.

72
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,200
The government knows that Tibet's usefulness is diminished if when a foreign military shows

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,260
up the population thinks that means liberation rather than invasion.

74
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,120
But there's another reason China needs Tibet—water.

75
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,140
The whole eastern zone of agricultural productivity exists because of all the water from Tibet.

76
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,980
The Yellow and Yangtze Rivers—China's two longest rivers—both get their water

77
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,060
from Tibet and foreign control of the water supply of the country would, in the government's

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,700
mind, strike a catastrophic blow to the country's food security.

79
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,320
If there were hypothetically a significant mountain range separating Tibet from eastern

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,760
China, there's a good chance it would still be independent.

81
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,660
The water would still come from China and the mountains would act as the geographical

82
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,900
protection that China desires.

83
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,620
But to the north is another one of China's assets—Mongolia.

84
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,100
It's an enormous, sparsely populated, friendly country.

85
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,820
With the Gobi Desert and other desolate terrain, there's just little chance that any modern

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,360
land-based army could make it across with any efficiency.

87
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,180
The supply lines would be enormously long and by the time they got to the Chinese border

88
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,140
there would have been ample warning.

89
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,420
But then again, who would want to invade?

90
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,540
Mongolia's only other neighbor is Russia which is a friendly ally of China both militarily

91
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,140
and economically.

92
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,860
China need not worry about its northern border until relations with Russia sour.

93
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,820
But that leaves the eastern border.

94
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,980
Now you would think that this would be China's safest border—the ocean—but you have to

95
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,260
consider that powerful states lay just off China's shores—the most powerful one being

96
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,260
the US.

97
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,580
The United States has a significant Pacific military presence with bases in South Korea,

98
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,060
Japan, and Guam.

99
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,140
It's also a close ally with Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia meaning that, if a

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,460
serious dispute with China occurred, the US would have no problem blockading China and

101
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,060
cutting off its maritime access and of course, China knows this.

102
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,200
That's why China has spent so much time, energy, and political capital to establish

103
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,740
sovereignty in the South China Sea by building military bases and artificial islands.

104
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,660
It knows that it needs these islands so it has sovereignty over the area so it can reach

105
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:02,840
the Pacific in case of war, but ironically, its actions in the area are souring its relations

106
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,240
with the very nations that China needs on its side.

107
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,080
The Philippines, for example, doesn't have a bulletproof relationship with the US.

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,160
While the two countries are allies, Philippine leadership has attempted to distance themselves

109
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,300
from the US.

110
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,980
If China hadn't ruined its relationship with the Philippines over the South China

111
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,740
Sea dispute, it could have won them to their side which would allow China crucial access

112
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,160
to the Pacific if the US attempted a naval blockade.

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,760
China's entire economy relies on exports so restrictions to access to the oceans would

114
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,000
lead to economic ruin.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,560
With its enormous population, China also relies on the importation of food, most of which

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,160
comes on ships.

117
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,820
Without jobs or food, there's a good chance that the population would rise up against

118
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,840
the government and end the current regime.

119
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,400
China didn't want to be a global power spreading its influence to every continent until recently.

120
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,600
It wanted to be the dominant power in its region—Asia—but historically it kept its

121
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,360
affairs within the region.

122
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,280
It never colonized outside of Asia and for much of history it didn't have a significant

123
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,080
navy to project its power around the world.

124
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,800
But that has changed because China got so big.

125
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,000
China is now of a size where it cannot support its population with its size alone.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,780
Self-sufficiency in food production was a major aspect of China's domestic policy

127
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,660
for decades, but the country has found a way to move past it as its economy has grown.

128
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:37,580
Africa has emerged almost as China's China—it supplies the country that supplies the world.

129
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,240
China has pumped enormous amounts of money into the continent in what some describe as

130
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,640
a form of neo-colonialism.

131
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,200
Chinese state-backed corporations have bought huge amounts of land in Africa to mine minerals,

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,180
drill for oil, and grow food.

133
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,620
China now imports more food and oil than it exports.

134
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,060
While that is a sign of the development of its economy, it also means that it is now

135
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,660
reliant on foreign powers which is a vulnerable position for a country that is often at odds

136
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,860
with some of those foreign powers.

137
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,980
China doesn't have bad geography.

138
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:13,820
It has some of the best in the world which has allowed for it to grow into the largest

139
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,160
country in the world, but as it grows into a more and more powerful and developed country,

140
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,080
it needs to be cognizant of its vulnerabilities if the current regime wishes to continue.

141
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,720
It's clear that because of its geography, the country is in a more precarious position

142
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,200
than some may think.

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,040
If there were ever a reason to go to war with China, the country is surrounded to the south

144
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,460
and east by countries that would likely side with NATO powers.

145
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,120
To the west and north, China is surrounded by countries and regions without the infrastructure

146
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,380
to support China in a war.

147
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:51,060
China is a nuclear power which means formal war with other superpowers is unlikely, but,

148
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,260
if it ever were to happen, it's hard to deny that its major disadvantage is its geography.

149
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,440
I just went through the process of building the new website for my other channel, Half

150
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,580
as Interesting.

151
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,820
All in, it took me about an hour to make this simple website and the hosting fees are very

152
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
reasonable.
