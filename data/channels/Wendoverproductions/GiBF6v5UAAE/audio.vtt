00:09.140 --> 00:12.880
China is a country both blessed and cursed by geography.

00:12.880 --> 00:18.640
On one hand its land has allowed for the country to grow to almost 1.4 billion people but on

00:18.640 --> 00:22.940
the other hand it really doesn't have great geographical protection.

00:22.940 --> 00:26.840
The beginning of what most people call Chinese history often starts with the Yellow River

00:26.840 --> 00:31.480
civilization and there's a good reason why this settlement grew into the most populous

00:31.480 --> 00:33.200
country in the world.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.800
The floodplain of the Yellow River is some of the best agricultural land in the world.

00:38.800 --> 00:43.620
In fact, the entirety of eastern China is perfectly suited for agriculture.

00:43.620 --> 00:47.160
This was and still is crucial to the country's success.

00:47.160 --> 00:52.040
What's more, this area is just warm and wet enough that farmers can do what is known

00:52.040 --> 00:53.560
as double cropping.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.240
Once the main crop of rice is cultivated in June and July, another slightly less productive

00:58.240 --> 01:01.320
crop can be planted for October cultivation.

01:01.320 --> 01:07.560
This increases rice output by about 25% which means China can make more food using the same

01:07.560 --> 01:08.560
amount of land.

01:08.560 --> 01:14.100
Europe mostly relies on wheat to feed its population which only outputs 4 million calories

01:14.100 --> 01:16.400
of food per acre of farmland.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.640
Rice on the other hand, grows 11 million calories worth per acre.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.080
It's easy to see why there are so many people in China.

01:25.080 --> 01:27.760
But China does have its geographical challenges.

01:27.760 --> 01:32.840
To the south it borders three countries—Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.420
The borders between these three countries and China seem almost arbitrarily set because

01:37.420 --> 01:38.880
they sort of were.

01:38.880 --> 01:43.820
Vietnam's was set after the Sino-French War, Laos' was set following its involvement

01:43.820 --> 01:49.000
in the Vietnam War, and Myanmar's was set following a small war with China in the 60's.

01:49.120 --> 01:55.000
None was naturally set by the environment—all were chosen arbitrarily by humans at war.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.320
These countries are not insignificant.

01:57.320 --> 02:03.280
Combined they have nearly 1 million active military personnel while China, the much larger

02:03.280 --> 02:05.920
country, has just over 2 million.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.600
Significant conflict with any of these countries would not be a one-sided war.

02:09.600 --> 02:13.800
While China would have the technological advantage, any of these three countries would have a

02:13.800 --> 02:16.160
significant home field advantage.

02:16.160 --> 02:21.560
Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar are all jungle countries—one of the most difficult environments

02:21.560 --> 02:22.600
for warfare.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.880
This was part of the reason why the Vietnam War lasted so long.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.520
It's just so hard to move troops in the jungle so everything slows down.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.740
Without any geographical protection of its borders, it would be significantly easier

02:34.740 --> 02:39.320
for Vietnam, Laos, or Myanmar to invade China than the reverse.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.000
But China does have an advantage elsewhere.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.880
China and India just aren't good friends.

02:44.880 --> 02:49.680
They have border disputes, military conflicts, political differences, so it's just hard

02:49.680 --> 02:53.980
for them to get along and that's why Tibet is so important.

02:53.980 --> 02:55.880
Tibet was historically its own empire.

02:55.880 --> 02:59.960
It was only in the last 300 years that China took it over.

02:59.960 --> 03:04.480
Tibetan people are ethnically different than the Han Chinese inhabiting China's east.

03:04.480 --> 03:09.160
It just doesn't make sense for Tibet to be part of China, except militarily.

03:09.160 --> 03:16.240
Only 0.2% of China's population lives in Tibet which accounts for nearly 13% of the

03:16.240 --> 03:17.240
country's area.

03:17.240 --> 03:21.840
More people live in the inner four districts of Beijing than the entirety of Tibet.

03:21.840 --> 03:25.840
It's just incredibly desolate, but it serves a purpose.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.160
If China didn't rule Tibet then India would.

03:29.160 --> 03:34.040
Maybe not formally, but there's little chance that an independent Tibet would not be economically

03:34.040 --> 03:37.720
and culturally dominated by either India or China.

03:37.720 --> 03:43.000
It just doesn't have enough power economically or militarily to resist, but in China's

03:43.000 --> 03:47.120
view it could not and cannot allow for an Indian Tibet.

03:47.120 --> 03:50.840
Indian rule of Tibet would mean that there would be no geographical protection between

03:50.840 --> 03:56.520
the populated area of China and India because Tibet is that geographical protection.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.620
Not only does Tibet extend China's border to the Himalayas, it's also an unpopulated

04:01.620 --> 04:06.340
area without the transportation infrastructure needed for an invading India to advance a

04:06.340 --> 04:09.500
large number of troops towards eastern China.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.220
But that also means that there's not the transportation infrastructure necessary for

04:13.220 --> 04:17.220
China to advance towards India, but China is trying to change that.

04:17.220 --> 04:21.460
They recently opened the world's highest railroad to Tibet, they're building highways

04:21.460 --> 04:27.320
constantly, and they also opened a large airport in Yingxi just miles away from the border.

04:27.320 --> 04:32.180
In the near term, the goal of these projects is to further integrate Tibet into China.

04:32.180 --> 04:36.300
The government has all but failed at winning over the native Tibetan population, but they

04:36.300 --> 04:38.780
can change who lives in Tibet.

04:38.780 --> 04:43.180
Hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese have moved into Tibet and many more visit each

04:43.180 --> 04:44.180
year.

04:44.180 --> 04:48.200
The government knows that Tibet's usefulness is diminished if when a foreign military shows

04:48.200 --> 04:52.260
up the population thinks that means liberation rather than invasion.

04:52.260 --> 04:56.120
But there's another reason China needs Tibet—water.

04:56.120 --> 05:02.140
The whole eastern zone of agricultural productivity exists because of all the water from Tibet.

05:02.140 --> 05:06.980
The Yellow and Yangtze Rivers—China's two longest rivers—both get their water

05:06.980 --> 05:12.060
from Tibet and foreign control of the water supply of the country would, in the government's

05:12.060 --> 05:15.700
mind, strike a catastrophic blow to the country's food security.

05:15.700 --> 05:20.320
If there were hypothetically a significant mountain range separating Tibet from eastern

05:20.320 --> 05:23.760
China, there's a good chance it would still be independent.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.660
The water would still come from China and the mountains would act as the geographical

05:27.660 --> 05:29.900
protection that China desires.

05:29.900 --> 05:32.620
But to the north is another one of China's assets—Mongolia.

05:32.620 --> 05:37.100
It's an enormous, sparsely populated, friendly country.

05:37.100 --> 05:41.820
With the Gobi Desert and other desolate terrain, there's just little chance that any modern

05:41.820 --> 05:45.360
land-based army could make it across with any efficiency.

05:45.360 --> 05:50.180
The supply lines would be enormously long and by the time they got to the Chinese border

05:50.180 --> 05:52.140
there would have been ample warning.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.420
But then again, who would want to invade?

05:54.420 --> 05:59.540
Mongolia's only other neighbor is Russia which is a friendly ally of China both militarily

05:59.540 --> 06:01.140
and economically.

06:01.140 --> 06:05.860
China need not worry about its northern border until relations with Russia sour.

06:05.860 --> 06:07.820
But that leaves the eastern border.

06:07.820 --> 06:11.980
Now you would think that this would be China's safest border—the ocean—but you have to

06:11.980 --> 06:17.260
consider that powerful states lay just off China's shores—the most powerful one being

06:17.260 --> 06:18.260
the US.

06:18.260 --> 06:23.580
The United States has a significant Pacific military presence with bases in South Korea,

06:23.580 --> 06:25.060
Japan, and Guam.

06:25.100 --> 06:31.140
It's also a close ally with Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia meaning that, if a

06:31.140 --> 06:36.460
serious dispute with China occurred, the US would have no problem blockading China and

06:36.460 --> 06:41.060
cutting off its maritime access and of course, China knows this.

06:41.060 --> 06:46.200
That's why China has spent so much time, energy, and political capital to establish

06:46.200 --> 06:51.740
sovereignty in the South China Sea by building military bases and artificial islands.

06:51.740 --> 06:56.660
It knows that it needs these islands so it has sovereignty over the area so it can reach

06:56.660 --> 07:02.840
the Pacific in case of war, but ironically, its actions in the area are souring its relations

07:02.840 --> 07:06.240
with the very nations that China needs on its side.

07:06.240 --> 07:11.080
The Philippines, for example, doesn't have a bulletproof relationship with the US.

07:11.080 --> 07:16.160
While the two countries are allies, Philippine leadership has attempted to distance themselves

07:16.160 --> 07:17.300
from the US.

07:17.300 --> 07:20.980
If China hadn't ruined its relationship with the Philippines over the South China

07:20.980 --> 07:25.740
Sea dispute, it could have won them to their side which would allow China crucial access

07:25.740 --> 07:29.160
to the Pacific if the US attempted a naval blockade.

07:29.160 --> 07:34.760
China's entire economy relies on exports so restrictions to access to the oceans would

07:34.760 --> 07:37.000
lead to economic ruin.

07:37.000 --> 07:42.560
With its enormous population, China also relies on the importation of food, most of which

07:42.560 --> 07:44.160
comes on ships.

07:44.160 --> 07:48.820
Without jobs or food, there's a good chance that the population would rise up against

07:48.820 --> 07:51.840
the government and end the current regime.

07:51.840 --> 07:57.400
China didn't want to be a global power spreading its influence to every continent until recently.

07:57.400 --> 08:02.600
It wanted to be the dominant power in its region—Asia—but historically it kept its

08:02.600 --> 08:04.360
affairs within the region.

08:04.360 --> 08:09.280
It never colonized outside of Asia and for much of history it didn't have a significant

08:09.280 --> 08:12.080
navy to project its power around the world.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.800
But that has changed because China got so big.

08:15.800 --> 08:21.000
China is now of a size where it cannot support its population with its size alone.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.780
Self-sufficiency in food production was a major aspect of China's domestic policy

08:25.780 --> 08:31.660
for decades, but the country has found a way to move past it as its economy has grown.

08:31.660 --> 08:37.580
Africa has emerged almost as China's China—it supplies the country that supplies the world.

08:37.580 --> 08:42.240
China has pumped enormous amounts of money into the continent in what some describe as

08:42.240 --> 08:44.640
a form of neo-colonialism.

08:44.640 --> 08:50.200
Chinese state-backed corporations have bought huge amounts of land in Africa to mine minerals,

08:50.200 --> 08:52.180
drill for oil, and grow food.

08:52.180 --> 08:55.620
China now imports more food and oil than it exports.

08:55.620 --> 09:00.060
While that is a sign of the development of its economy, it also means that it is now

09:00.060 --> 09:05.660
reliant on foreign powers which is a vulnerable position for a country that is often at odds

09:05.660 --> 09:07.860
with some of those foreign powers.

09:07.860 --> 09:09.980
China doesn't have bad geography.

09:09.980 --> 09:13.820
It has some of the best in the world which has allowed for it to grow into the largest

09:13.820 --> 09:19.160
country in the world, but as it grows into a more and more powerful and developed country,

09:19.160 --> 09:24.080
it needs to be cognizant of its vulnerabilities if the current regime wishes to continue.

09:24.080 --> 09:28.720
It's clear that because of its geography, the country is in a more precarious position

09:28.720 --> 09:30.200
than some may think.

09:30.200 --> 09:35.040
If there were ever a reason to go to war with China, the country is surrounded to the south

09:35.040 --> 09:38.460
and east by countries that would likely side with NATO powers.

09:38.460 --> 09:43.120
To the west and north, China is surrounded by countries and regions without the infrastructure

09:43.120 --> 09:45.380
to support China in a war.

09:45.380 --> 09:51.060
China is a nuclear power which means formal war with other superpowers is unlikely, but,

09:51.060 --> 09:57.260
if it ever were to happen, it's hard to deny that its major disadvantage is its geography.

09:57.260 --> 10:01.440
I just went through the process of building the new website for my other channel, Half

10:01.440 --> 10:02.580
