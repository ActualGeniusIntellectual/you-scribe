9140	12880	China is a country both blessed and cursed by geography.
12880	18640	On one hand its land has allowed for the country to grow to almost 1.4 billion people but on
18640	22940	the other hand it really doesn't have great geographical protection.
22940	26840	The beginning of what most people call Chinese history often starts with the Yellow River
26840	31480	civilization and there's a good reason why this settlement grew into the most populous
31480	33200	country in the world.
33200	38800	The floodplain of the Yellow River is some of the best agricultural land in the world.
38800	43620	In fact, the entirety of eastern China is perfectly suited for agriculture.
43620	47160	This was and still is crucial to the country's success.
47160	52040	What's more, this area is just warm and wet enough that farmers can do what is known
52040	53560	as double cropping.
53600	58240	Once the main crop of rice is cultivated in June and July, another slightly less productive
58240	61320	crop can be planted for October cultivation.
61320	67560	This increases rice output by about 25% which means China can make more food using the same
67560	68560	amount of land.
68560	74100	Europe mostly relies on wheat to feed its population which only outputs 4 million calories
74100	76400	of food per acre of farmland.
76400	80640	Rice on the other hand, grows 11 million calories worth per acre.
80640	85080	It's easy to see why there are so many people in China.
85080	87760	But China does have its geographical challenges.
87760	92840	To the south it borders three countries—Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar.
92840	97420	The borders between these three countries and China seem almost arbitrarily set because
97420	98880	they sort of were.
98880	103820	Vietnam's was set after the Sino-French War, Laos' was set following its involvement
103820	109000	in the Vietnam War, and Myanmar's was set following a small war with China in the 60's.
109120	115000	None was naturally set by the environment—all were chosen arbitrarily by humans at war.
115000	117320	These countries are not insignificant.
117320	123280	Combined they have nearly 1 million active military personnel while China, the much larger
123280	125920	country, has just over 2 million.
125920	129600	Significant conflict with any of these countries would not be a one-sided war.
129600	133800	While China would have the technological advantage, any of these three countries would have a
133800	136160	significant home field advantage.
136160	141560	Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar are all jungle countries—one of the most difficult environments
141560	142600	for warfare.
142600	145880	This was part of the reason why the Vietnam War lasted so long.
145880	150520	It's just so hard to move troops in the jungle so everything slows down.
150520	154740	Without any geographical protection of its borders, it would be significantly easier
154740	159320	for Vietnam, Laos, or Myanmar to invade China than the reverse.
159320	162000	But China does have an advantage elsewhere.
162000	164880	China and India just aren't good friends.
164880	169680	They have border disputes, military conflicts, political differences, so it's just hard
169680	173980	for them to get along and that's why Tibet is so important.
173980	175880	Tibet was historically its own empire.
175880	179960	It was only in the last 300 years that China took it over.
179960	184480	Tibetan people are ethnically different than the Han Chinese inhabiting China's east.
184480	189160	It just doesn't make sense for Tibet to be part of China, except militarily.
189160	196240	Only 0.2% of China's population lives in Tibet which accounts for nearly 13% of the
196240	197240	country's area.
197240	201840	More people live in the inner four districts of Beijing than the entirety of Tibet.
201840	205840	It's just incredibly desolate, but it serves a purpose.
205840	209160	If China didn't rule Tibet then India would.
209160	214040	Maybe not formally, but there's little chance that an independent Tibet would not be economically
214040	217720	and culturally dominated by either India or China.
217720	223000	It just doesn't have enough power economically or militarily to resist, but in China's
223000	227120	view it could not and cannot allow for an Indian Tibet.
227120	230840	Indian rule of Tibet would mean that there would be no geographical protection between
230840	236520	the populated area of China and India because Tibet is that geographical protection.
236520	241620	Not only does Tibet extend China's border to the Himalayas, it's also an unpopulated
241620	246340	area without the transportation infrastructure needed for an invading India to advance a
246340	249500	large number of troops towards eastern China.
249500	253220	But that also means that there's not the transportation infrastructure necessary for
253220	257220	China to advance towards India, but China is trying to change that.
257220	261460	They recently opened the world's highest railroad to Tibet, they're building highways
261460	267320	constantly, and they also opened a large airport in Yingxi just miles away from the border.
267320	272180	In the near term, the goal of these projects is to further integrate Tibet into China.
272180	276300	The government has all but failed at winning over the native Tibetan population, but they
276300	278780	can change who lives in Tibet.
278780	283180	Hundreds of thousands of Han Chinese have moved into Tibet and many more visit each
283180	284180	year.
284180	288200	The government knows that Tibet's usefulness is diminished if when a foreign military shows
288200	292260	up the population thinks that means liberation rather than invasion.
292260	296120	But there's another reason China needs Tibet—water.
296120	302140	The whole eastern zone of agricultural productivity exists because of all the water from Tibet.
302140	306980	The Yellow and Yangtze Rivers—China's two longest rivers—both get their water
306980	312060	from Tibet and foreign control of the water supply of the country would, in the government's
312060	315700	mind, strike a catastrophic blow to the country's food security.
315700	320320	If there were hypothetically a significant mountain range separating Tibet from eastern
320320	323760	China, there's a good chance it would still be independent.
323760	327660	The water would still come from China and the mountains would act as the geographical
327660	329900	protection that China desires.
329900	332620	But to the north is another one of China's assets—Mongolia.
332620	337100	It's an enormous, sparsely populated, friendly country.
337100	341820	With the Gobi Desert and other desolate terrain, there's just little chance that any modern
341820	345360	land-based army could make it across with any efficiency.
345360	350180	The supply lines would be enormously long and by the time they got to the Chinese border
350180	352140	there would have been ample warning.
352140	354420	But then again, who would want to invade?
354420	359540	Mongolia's only other neighbor is Russia which is a friendly ally of China both militarily
359540	361140	and economically.
361140	365860	China need not worry about its northern border until relations with Russia sour.
365860	367820	But that leaves the eastern border.
367820	371980	Now you would think that this would be China's safest border—the ocean—but you have to
371980	377260	consider that powerful states lay just off China's shores—the most powerful one being
377260	378260	the US.
378260	383580	The United States has a significant Pacific military presence with bases in South Korea,
383580	385060	Japan, and Guam.
385100	391140	It's also a close ally with Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia meaning that, if a
391140	396460	serious dispute with China occurred, the US would have no problem blockading China and
396460	401060	cutting off its maritime access and of course, China knows this.
401060	406200	That's why China has spent so much time, energy, and political capital to establish
406200	411740	sovereignty in the South China Sea by building military bases and artificial islands.
411740	416660	It knows that it needs these islands so it has sovereignty over the area so it can reach
416660	422840	the Pacific in case of war, but ironically, its actions in the area are souring its relations
422840	426240	with the very nations that China needs on its side.
426240	431080	The Philippines, for example, doesn't have a bulletproof relationship with the US.
431080	436160	While the two countries are allies, Philippine leadership has attempted to distance themselves
436160	437300	from the US.
437300	440980	If China hadn't ruined its relationship with the Philippines over the South China
440980	445740	Sea dispute, it could have won them to their side which would allow China crucial access
445740	449160	to the Pacific if the US attempted a naval blockade.
449160	454760	China's entire economy relies on exports so restrictions to access to the oceans would
454760	457000	lead to economic ruin.
457000	462560	With its enormous population, China also relies on the importation of food, most of which
462560	464160	comes on ships.
464160	468820	Without jobs or food, there's a good chance that the population would rise up against
468820	471840	the government and end the current regime.
471840	477400	China didn't want to be a global power spreading its influence to every continent until recently.
477400	482600	It wanted to be the dominant power in its region—Asia—but historically it kept its
482600	484360	affairs within the region.
484360	489280	It never colonized outside of Asia and for much of history it didn't have a significant
489280	492080	navy to project its power around the world.
492080	495800	But that has changed because China got so big.
495800	501000	China is now of a size where it cannot support its population with its size alone.
501000	505780	Self-sufficiency in food production was a major aspect of China's domestic policy
505780	511660	for decades, but the country has found a way to move past it as its economy has grown.
511660	517580	Africa has emerged almost as China's China—it supplies the country that supplies the world.
517580	522240	China has pumped enormous amounts of money into the continent in what some describe as
522240	524640	a form of neo-colonialism.
524640	530200	Chinese state-backed corporations have bought huge amounts of land in Africa to mine minerals,
530200	532180	drill for oil, and grow food.
532180	535620	China now imports more food and oil than it exports.
535620	540060	While that is a sign of the development of its economy, it also means that it is now
540060	545660	reliant on foreign powers which is a vulnerable position for a country that is often at odds
545660	547860	with some of those foreign powers.
547860	549980	China doesn't have bad geography.
549980	553820	It has some of the best in the world which has allowed for it to grow into the largest
553820	559160	country in the world, but as it grows into a more and more powerful and developed country,
559160	564080	it needs to be cognizant of its vulnerabilities if the current regime wishes to continue.
564080	568720	It's clear that because of its geography, the country is in a more precarious position
568720	570200	than some may think.
570200	575040	If there were ever a reason to go to war with China, the country is surrounded to the south
575040	578460	and east by countries that would likely side with NATO powers.
578460	583120	To the west and north, China is surrounded by countries and regions without the infrastructure
583120	585380	to support China in a war.
585380	591060	China is a nuclear power which means formal war with other superpowers is unlikely, but,
591060	597260	if it ever were to happen, it's hard to deny that its major disadvantage is its geography.
