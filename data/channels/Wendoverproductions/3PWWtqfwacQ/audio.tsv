8520	14200	The Cumberland Valley is home to six towns lying between Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisburg,
14200	19600	Pennsylvania—Greencastle, Chambersburg, Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle, and Mechanicsburg.
19600	24560	What's exceptional about these small Pennsylvania towns is that they're each almost exactly
24560	26320	ten miles from each other.
26320	30640	The distances deviate by no more than a mile from this rule.
30640	33440	This isn't a coincidence and this isn't planned.
33440	38760	Drawing equal sized radii around each town shows you their spheres of influence.
38760	43840	Assuming each town has the exact same shops and services, rational people will go to whichever
43840	47220	town is closest to buy or sell goods.
47220	52020	Towns ten miles apart mean that nobody has to travel more than five miles to reach a
52020	53020	town.
53020	57140	Each of these towns was founded before the formation of the United States so that means
57140	62020	that, of course, nobody had cars and pretty much everybody walked everywhere.
62020	67100	Ten miles, or five miles each way, is about the distance a person can comfortably walk
67100	71580	in a day with enough time to buy or sell goods at a central market.
71580	76140	Back in this era before cars, a five mile radius was essentially the largest possible
76140	81640	commuter zone to small agricultural towns and therefore having towns ten miles apart
81640	85260	was the most efficient possible use of rural land.
85260	89920	When you get the chance, take a look at a map of a rural area that existed before cars.
89920	94800	You'll see that the distance between medium sized towns is almost always somewhere between
94800	97600	about ten to fifteen miles.
97600	102320	Because the Cumberland Valley is a valley, towns really could only develop in a line,
102320	105680	but in most cases towns develop in all directions.
105680	109360	This is what the ten mile rule looks like when going out in all directions.
109360	113740	Each of these points is a town and the hexagon around it is the area from which people will
113740	115160	go to the town.
115160	120320	In the real world, each of these towns probably has a small grocery store, a pharmacy, a bank,
120320	121680	and maybe a restaurant.
121680	126400	Since everybody uses these services, there doesn't have to be many people in a town's
126400	129780	sphere of influence in order to sustain these shops.
129780	133360	But where do you put something more specialized, like a mechanic?
133360	137160	People only need to go to the mechanic every once in a while so you need more people to
137160	140320	sustain one mechanic shop than one grocery store.
140320	145120	Well, some of these small towns develop into larger towns with more people that can support
145120	147980	more specialized shops and services.
147980	152560	Putting these larger towns with more specialized shops closer together would be unsustainable
152560	156400	since there wouldn't be enough people going to those shops, but putting them farther apart
156400	160660	would be inefficient since there's land that people would not go to a city from.
160660	163960	This happens once or twice more until you have cities.
163960	168520	These cities have the largest spheres of influence and the most specialized shops.
168520	172720	You of course still have grocery stores and pharmacies in cities, but you also have things
172720	176740	like luxury car dealerships, brain surgery centers, and airports.
176740	182280	The city's sphere of influence is enormous because people will travel hundreds of miles
182280	186920	to buy an expensive car or get brain surgery or fly from an airport.
186920	188400	Think about it within a city.
188400	191540	How far would you walk to buy a latte?
191540	195700	Probably only a few blocks, and that's why you see Starbucks or other coffee shops
195700	197520	on almost every block.
197520	202200	Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only need a few blocks of people to sustain one
202200	203580	coffee shop.
203580	206120	But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook?
206120	209900	Probably quite far since it's an infrequent and substantial purchase.
209900	213780	That's why Apple stores are rather rare even in cities.
213780	218940	You need an enormous amount of people to sustain one Apple store and we can actually figure
218940	220620	out roughly how many.
220620	225180	In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is about 20 miles away from the New Haven store
225180	228180	to the northeast and the Stanford store to the southwest.
228180	231940	In the 10 mile radius around the Trumbull Apple Store, there are about half a million
231940	237140	inhabitants, which tells us that you need about half a million people to sustain one
237140	238180	Apple store.
238180	242340	We can compare that to the Starbucks's of lower Manhattan which are spread out at an
242340	244920	average distance of about 600 feet.
244920	251420	Drawing a 300 foot radius around one Starbucks in lower Manhattan covers about 6,000 people
251420	255680	which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000 people to sustain it.
255680	259920	Of course, both Connecticut and New York are places with higher than average incomes which
259920	263840	means that less people are needed to sustain one Starbucks or Apple store.
263840	268420	The numbers would be very different in, say, rural Kansas, but since each store generally
268420	272960	only builds in areas with higher than average incomes, this gives a good sense of how many
273000	277520	people Apple and Starbucks look for in an area before opening up a store.
277520	283180	So, our model shows where cities should be, but it's not like this in reality.
283180	285620	This is the most efficient spread of cities.
285620	290920	If you're assuming that cities are on a perfectly flat plain with no geographic features,
290920	296300	no social influences, no variability of income, equal distribution of resources, essentially
296300	300620	assuming the world is one homogeneous place, which it's not.
300620	306740	In reality, of course, our world has an enormous effect on where and why cities develop.
306740	311900	To start out, let's cut this down to one city on a flat, featureless plain for simplicity.
311900	315380	What affects the location of cities more than anything is water.
315380	320380	If we put an ocean on one side of our isotropic plain, our city will almost certainly locate
320380	321580	near it.
321580	324820	Oceans have always been and still are what connects the world.
324820	329620	There's no other means of transport that can move such enormous amounts of cargo for
329620	330900	so little.
330900	335860	Any city needs to be economically efficient to grow and it will cost more to bring goods
335860	340620	to a city that's a thousand miles inland than one right by the ocean.
340620	341820	Just look at Europe.
341820	346820	Six of the ten largest European cities are within 100 miles of the coast, but oceans
346820	349800	aren't the only bodies of water to affect cities.
349800	353180	Rivers are just as or perhaps even more influential.
353180	358540	Milan, the 19th largest European city, is the largest to not be either directly on the
358540	364100	ocean or on a river and even then it's only 15 miles from a river and 75 miles from
364100	365100	the ocean.
365100	370320	Until the last century or so, cities could not survive without direct water access.
370320	375540	If you need more proof, 14 of the 15 largest cities in the world are within a few dozen
375540	377360	miles of the ocean.
377360	382120	Perhaps the most obvious attractor for cities is resources so going back to our isotropic
382120	387020	plain, putting natural resources anywhere on this map will draw cities near it.
387020	392040	Cities that existed before the last century or so generally sprung up right near the resources,
392040	397700	much like Pittsburgh since they acted as manufacturing and transportation hubs for those resources,
397700	402100	but more recently, new resource-dependent cities don't need to be as close to the
402100	403720	resources themselves.
403720	408020	New transportation technologies can bring the resources from their source.
408020	409300	Just look at Dubai.
409300	413980	Of course the UAE has enormous oil deposits, but they're much closer to Abu Dhabi and
413980	416340	the southwest than Dubai.
416340	422580	In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 residents—less than half that of Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
422580	425300	one of the farming towns we talked about at the beginning.
425300	432940	That only grew to 40,000 by 1960, but today it's known worldwide and has more than 2.5
432940	433940	million residents.
433940	439180	It was able to grow at this enormous rate, even faster than Abu Dhabi, since it cemented
439180	444380	itself as the economic and administrative hub for the oil industries of the region.
444420	447660	Another geographic feature that we can add to the plane is mountains.
447660	452180	Now, mountains don't always have a uniform effect on cities.
452180	459100	Mexico City, Bogota, and Addis Ababa are all enormous cities at elevations above 7,000
459100	460100	feet.
460100	464860	Mountains do make transport and trade difficult, but they also provide protection.
464860	469380	Many ancient cities grew in these locations since they were easy to protect which left
469380	474660	more time to focus on growing the city, but mountains can also hinder development.
474660	479240	For quite a while, the United States could not develop west of the Appalachian Mountains.
479240	482100	They just served as an enormous barrier.
482100	488060	In 1800, the average center of population for the entire United States was here even
488060	491740	though the US had sovereignty over this entire area.
491740	495860	Of course technology eventually conquered this barrier and moved the mean population
495860	500340	center all the way out to Missouri today, but if the Appalachian Mountains didn't
500340	504760	exist, American history and geography would be completely different.
504760	508740	We would have seen urban development much earlier in the midwest, but mountains can
508740	510580	also have another effect.
510580	516300	You see, coal, silver, gold, and other mineral deposits are all often located in mountainous
516300	521180	regions, and, just like Dubai, cities can develop in less hospitable and easy places
521180	522680	due to resources.
522680	527600	The economic advantage of exploiting the resources overpowers the economic disadvantage
527600	530200	of being in an inhospitable location.
530200	537360	Denver, Colorado grew 650% between 1870 and 1880 with the opening of a railroad branch
537360	539960	connecting with a transcontinental railroad.
539960	544560	It served as an access point to transportation to the gold miners in the Rockies.
544560	549360	So, mountains can either push cities away or bring them nearer—it really just depends
549360	550360	on the circumstance.
550880	554080	Let's exchange our isotropic plane for a world map.
554080	555760	Where should cities be on here?
555760	562360	Well, our world's cities are not necessarily in all the most geographically efficient locations.
562360	566400	While there is a certain level of natural selection that grows the efficiently placed
566400	570720	cities and shrinks the inefficiently placed cities, humans are not always able to put
570720	573360	cities in the most efficient locations.
573360	578540	Let's put up the 224 cities in the world with a population over 2 million.
578540	580820	You can immediately see some patterns.
580820	584100	Putting up the equator, you can see there's a clear divide.
584100	587900	Only 32 of these cities lie in the southern hemisphere.
587900	592540	One might think that this is because there is so much more land in the northern hemisphere,
592540	594400	but that's not entirely true.
594400	600560	You see, the southern hemisphere still has 32% of the world's land, but only has 14%
600560	602180	of the world's large cities.
602180	606540	There's clearly a higher density of cities in the northern hemisphere.
606540	609700	You can pretty much trace this all back to Europe and Asia.
609700	614360	The first large civilizations and empires were on these two continents even though the
614360	617260	human race likely originated in Africa.
617260	621740	There's hundreds of different theories on why civilizations succeeded in some places
621740	625900	and failed in others, but one of the more plausible and interesting theories is that
625900	629800	Europe and Asia succeeded because they're wide instead of tall.
629800	634060	The very shape of continents may have changed the course of human history.
634060	639900	You see, when a continent is wide, you have a ton of land with roughly the same climate.
639900	643980	Climate tends to change when you go north and south rather than east and west as a nature
643980	646560	of how the earth rotates around the sun.
646560	650940	Much of the success of early civilizations had to do with the domestication of plants
650940	653580	and animals and the corresponding technology.
653580	657700	When expanding horizontally, the climate is similar enough that an empire can use the
657700	663160	same successful plants and animals while expanding vertically requires the domestication of new
663160	664880	plants and animals.
664880	669680	If a civilization started in Central America, for example, there would be very little land
669680	674820	on the continent with a similar climate and their expansion would be severely limited.
674820	680180	In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, there's thousands upon thousands of miles of similar
680180	684340	climate that can be reached just by traveling east or west.
684340	689200	Just look at the maps of the four largest early empires—the Qing Dynasty, the Abbasid
689200	692900	Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, and the Mongol Empire.
692900	696940	They were all in Eurasia and they all expanded horizontally.
696940	702620	When some of the more modern empires expanded, they had the technology to do so overseas.
702620	707380	The three major modern empires were the British, Spanish, and French empires, each of which
707380	709660	came from relatively similar climates.
709660	715300	A major reason why America was able to succeed is because all the agriculture from Europe
715300	716620	worked there.
716620	720340	Climactically, Europe and America are nearly identical.
720340	724600	The majority of developed colonized countries are in the northern hemisphere just because
724600	729660	they were closest to Europe, but formerly British countries like South Africa, Australia,
729660	733380	and New Zealand are all highly developed and in the southern hemisphere.
733380	737840	Their success over more northern countries in the southern hemisphere can also be partially
737840	741100	attributed to their greater climate similarity to Europe.
741100	743500	Let's ask one more question.
743500	747900	If our world only had one city, where would it logically be?
747900	752940	Well, if you take the location of every person in the world and average it out, you come
752940	755060	to south-central Asia.
755060	760440	That means that this general region is the optimum place to live on the planet, but where
760440	763860	more specifically should our world city go?
763860	768900	Well, this region is already in the northern hemisphere and in Eurasia so we've already
768900	771120	covered those two criteria.
771120	776760	We want a place within 100 or so miles of the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains
776760	778760	with rich mineral deposits.
778760	784480	The single best place for a city on earth just might be Dhaka, Bangladesh.
784480	789920	Every geographic model and theory says that there is no better place on earth to put a
789920	791240	city than here.
791240	793120	There's evidence to back this up.
793120	798280	Dhaka is between the 4th and the 18th largest metropolitan area on earth depending on how
798280	803600	you define metropolitan area and Bangladesh is the 6th densest country on earth.
803600	810260	There are 161 million people living in an area of about the size of England.
810260	814800	History has affected geography enough that the largest and most advanced civilizations
814800	819980	are not all in south-central Asia, but if we started all over again, did humanity a
819980	826400	second time, every geographic model says that this region could be the origin and central
826400	829560	point of human civilization.
829560	832920	I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.
832920	838480	This video was made possible by my amazing, brand new sponsor, Squarespace.
