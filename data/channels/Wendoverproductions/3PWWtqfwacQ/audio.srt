3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,200
The Cumberland Valley is home to six towns lying between Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisburg,

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,600
Pennsylvania—Greencastle, Chambersburg, Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle, and Mechanicsburg.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,560
What's exceptional about these small Pennsylvania towns is that they're each almost exactly

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
ten miles from each other.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,640
The distances deviate by no more than a mile from this rule.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
This isn't a coincidence and this isn't planned.

9
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,760
Drawing equal sized radii around each town shows you their spheres of influence.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,840
Assuming each town has the exact same shops and services, rational people will go to whichever

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,220
town is closest to buy or sell goods.

12
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,020
Towns ten miles apart mean that nobody has to travel more than five miles to reach a

13
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
town.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,140
Each of these towns was founded before the formation of the United States so that means

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,020
that, of course, nobody had cars and pretty much everybody walked everywhere.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,100
Ten miles, or five miles each way, is about the distance a person can comfortably walk

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,580
in a day with enough time to buy or sell goods at a central market.

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,140
Back in this era before cars, a five mile radius was essentially the largest possible

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,640
commuter zone to small agricultural towns and therefore having towns ten miles apart

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,260
was the most efficient possible use of rural land.

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,920
When you get the chance, take a look at a map of a rural area that existed before cars.

22
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,800
You'll see that the distance between medium sized towns is almost always somewhere between

23
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,600
about ten to fifteen miles.

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,320
Because the Cumberland Valley is a valley, towns really could only develop in a line,

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,680
but in most cases towns develop in all directions.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,360
This is what the ten mile rule looks like when going out in all directions.

27
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,740
Each of these points is a town and the hexagon around it is the area from which people will

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,160
go to the town.

29
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:00,320
In the real world, each of these towns probably has a small grocery store, a pharmacy, a bank,

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,680
and maybe a restaurant.

31
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,400
Since everybody uses these services, there doesn't have to be many people in a town's

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,780
sphere of influence in order to sustain these shops.

33
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,360
But where do you put something more specialized, like a mechanic?

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,160
People only need to go to the mechanic every once in a while so you need more people to

35
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,320
sustain one mechanic shop than one grocery store.

36
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,120
Well, some of these small towns develop into larger towns with more people that can support

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,980
more specialized shops and services.

38
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,560
Putting these larger towns with more specialized shops closer together would be unsustainable

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,400
since there wouldn't be enough people going to those shops, but putting them farther apart

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,660
would be inefficient since there's land that people would not go to a city from.

41
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,960
This happens once or twice more until you have cities.

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,520
These cities have the largest spheres of influence and the most specialized shops.

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,720
You of course still have grocery stores and pharmacies in cities, but you also have things

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,740
like luxury car dealerships, brain surgery centers, and airports.

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,280
The city's sphere of influence is enormous because people will travel hundreds of miles

46
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,920
to buy an expensive car or get brain surgery or fly from an airport.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,400
Think about it within a city.

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,540
How far would you walk to buy a latte?

49
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,700
Probably only a few blocks, and that's why you see Starbucks or other coffee shops

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,520
on almost every block.

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,200
Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only need a few blocks of people to sustain one

52
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,580
coffee shop.

53
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,120
But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook?

54
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,900
Probably quite far since it's an infrequent and substantial purchase.

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,780
That's why Apple stores are rather rare even in cities.

56
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,940
You need an enormous amount of people to sustain one Apple store and we can actually figure

57
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
out roughly how many.

58
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,180
In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is about 20 miles away from the New Haven store

59
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,180
to the northeast and the Stanford store to the southwest.

60
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,940
In the 10 mile radius around the Trumbull Apple Store, there are about half a million

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,140
inhabitants, which tells us that you need about half a million people to sustain one

62
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,180
Apple store.

63
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,340
We can compare that to the Starbucks's of lower Manhattan which are spread out at an

64
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,920
average distance of about 600 feet.

65
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:11,420
Drawing a 300 foot radius around one Starbucks in lower Manhattan covers about 6,000 people

66
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,680
which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000 people to sustain it.

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,920
Of course, both Connecticut and New York are places with higher than average incomes which

68
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,840
means that less people are needed to sustain one Starbucks or Apple store.

69
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,420
The numbers would be very different in, say, rural Kansas, but since each store generally

70
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,960
only builds in areas with higher than average incomes, this gives a good sense of how many

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,520
people Apple and Starbucks look for in an area before opening up a store.

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,180
So, our model shows where cities should be, but it's not like this in reality.

73
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,620
This is the most efficient spread of cities.

74
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,920
If you're assuming that cities are on a perfectly flat plain with no geographic features,

75
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,300
no social influences, no variability of income, equal distribution of resources, essentially

76
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,620
assuming the world is one homogeneous place, which it's not.

77
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,740
In reality, of course, our world has an enormous effect on where and why cities develop.

78
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,900
To start out, let's cut this down to one city on a flat, featureless plain for simplicity.

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,380
What affects the location of cities more than anything is water.

80
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,380
If we put an ocean on one side of our isotropic plain, our city will almost certainly locate

81
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,580
near it.

82
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,820
Oceans have always been and still are what connects the world.

83
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,620
There's no other means of transport that can move such enormous amounts of cargo for

84
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,900
so little.

85
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,860
Any city needs to be economically efficient to grow and it will cost more to bring goods

86
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,620
to a city that's a thousand miles inland than one right by the ocean.

87
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,820
Just look at Europe.

88
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,820
Six of the ten largest European cities are within 100 miles of the coast, but oceans

89
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,800
aren't the only bodies of water to affect cities.

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,180
Rivers are just as or perhaps even more influential.

91
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,540
Milan, the 19th largest European city, is the largest to not be either directly on the

92
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:04,100
ocean or on a river and even then it's only 15 miles from a river and 75 miles from

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
the ocean.

94
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,320
Until the last century or so, cities could not survive without direct water access.

95
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,540
If you need more proof, 14 of the 15 largest cities in the world are within a few dozen

96
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,360
miles of the ocean.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,120
Perhaps the most obvious attractor for cities is resources so going back to our isotropic

98
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,020
plain, putting natural resources anywhere on this map will draw cities near it.

99
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,040
Cities that existed before the last century or so generally sprung up right near the resources,

100
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,700
much like Pittsburgh since they acted as manufacturing and transportation hubs for those resources,

101
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,100
but more recently, new resource-dependent cities don't need to be as close to the

102
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,720
resources themselves.

103
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,020
New transportation technologies can bring the resources from their source.

104
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,300
Just look at Dubai.

105
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,980
Of course the UAE has enormous oil deposits, but they're much closer to Abu Dhabi and

106
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,340
the southwest than Dubai.

107
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,580
In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 residents—less than half that of Carlisle, Pennsylvania,

108
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,300
one of the farming towns we talked about at the beginning.

109
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,940
That only grew to 40,000 by 1960, but today it's known worldwide and has more than 2.5

110
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
million residents.

111
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,180
It was able to grow at this enormous rate, even faster than Abu Dhabi, since it cemented

112
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:24,380
itself as the economic and administrative hub for the oil industries of the region.

113
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,660
Another geographic feature that we can add to the plane is mountains.

114
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:32,180
Now, mountains don't always have a uniform effect on cities.

115
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,100
Mexico City, Bogota, and Addis Ababa are all enormous cities at elevations above 7,000

116
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,100
feet.

117
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,860
Mountains do make transport and trade difficult, but they also provide protection.

118
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,380
Many ancient cities grew in these locations since they were easy to protect which left

119
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,660
more time to focus on growing the city, but mountains can also hinder development.

120
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,240
For quite a while, the United States could not develop west of the Appalachian Mountains.

121
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,100
They just served as an enormous barrier.

122
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:08,060
In 1800, the average center of population for the entire United States was here even

123
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,740
though the US had sovereignty over this entire area.

124
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,860
Of course technology eventually conquered this barrier and moved the mean population

125
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,340
center all the way out to Missouri today, but if the Appalachian Mountains didn't

126
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,760
exist, American history and geography would be completely different.

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,740
We would have seen urban development much earlier in the midwest, but mountains can

128
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,580
also have another effect.

129
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,300
You see, coal, silver, gold, and other mineral deposits are all often located in mountainous

130
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,180
regions, and, just like Dubai, cities can develop in less hospitable and easy places

131
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,680
due to resources.

132
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,600
The economic advantage of exploiting the resources overpowers the economic disadvantage

133
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,200
of being in an inhospitable location.

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,360
Denver, Colorado grew 650% between 1870 and 1880 with the opening of a railroad branch

135
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,960
connecting with a transcontinental railroad.

136
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,560
It served as an access point to transportation to the gold miners in the Rockies.

137
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,360
So, mountains can either push cities away or bring them nearer—it really just depends

138
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
on the circumstance.

139
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,080
Let's exchange our isotropic plane for a world map.

140
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,760
Where should cities be on here?

141
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Well, our world's cities are not necessarily in all the most geographically efficient locations.

142
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,400
While there is a certain level of natural selection that grows the efficiently placed

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,720
cities and shrinks the inefficiently placed cities, humans are not always able to put

144
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,360
cities in the most efficient locations.

145
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,540
Let's put up the 224 cities in the world with a population over 2 million.

146
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,820
You can immediately see some patterns.

147
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,100
Putting up the equator, you can see there's a clear divide.

148
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,900
Only 32 of these cities lie in the southern hemisphere.

149
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,540
One might think that this is because there is so much more land in the northern hemisphere,

150
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,400
but that's not entirely true.

151
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,560
You see, the southern hemisphere still has 32% of the world's land, but only has 14%

152
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,180
of the world's large cities.

153
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,540
There's clearly a higher density of cities in the northern hemisphere.

154
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,700
You can pretty much trace this all back to Europe and Asia.

155
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,360
The first large civilizations and empires were on these two continents even though the

156
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,260
human race likely originated in Africa.

157
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,740
There's hundreds of different theories on why civilizations succeeded in some places

158
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,900
and failed in others, but one of the more plausible and interesting theories is that

159
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,800
Europe and Asia succeeded because they're wide instead of tall.

160
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,060
The very shape of continents may have changed the course of human history.

161
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,900
You see, when a continent is wide, you have a ton of land with roughly the same climate.

162
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,980
Climate tends to change when you go north and south rather than east and west as a nature

163
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,560
of how the earth rotates around the sun.

164
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,940
Much of the success of early civilizations had to do with the domestication of plants

165
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,580
and animals and the corresponding technology.

166
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:57,700
When expanding horizontally, the climate is similar enough that an empire can use the

167
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:03,160
same successful plants and animals while expanding vertically requires the domestication of new

168
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,880
plants and animals.

169
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,680
If a civilization started in Central America, for example, there would be very little land

170
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,820
on the continent with a similar climate and their expansion would be severely limited.

171
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,180
In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, there's thousands upon thousands of miles of similar

172
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,340
climate that can be reached just by traveling east or west.

173
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:29,200
Just look at the maps of the four largest early empires—the Qing Dynasty, the Abbasid

174
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,900
Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, and the Mongol Empire.

175
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,940
They were all in Eurasia and they all expanded horizontally.

176
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,620
When some of the more modern empires expanded, they had the technology to do so overseas.

177
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,380
The three major modern empires were the British, Spanish, and French empires, each of which

178
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,660
came from relatively similar climates.

179
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,300
A major reason why America was able to succeed is because all the agriculture from Europe

180
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,620
worked there.

181
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,340
Climactically, Europe and America are nearly identical.

182
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,600
The majority of developed colonized countries are in the northern hemisphere just because

183
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:09,660
they were closest to Europe, but formerly British countries like South Africa, Australia,

184
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,380
and New Zealand are all highly developed and in the southern hemisphere.

185
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,840
Their success over more northern countries in the southern hemisphere can also be partially

186
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,100
attributed to their greater climate similarity to Europe.

187
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,500
Let's ask one more question.

188
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,900
If our world only had one city, where would it logically be?

189
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,940
Well, if you take the location of every person in the world and average it out, you come

190
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,060
to south-central Asia.

191
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,440
That means that this general region is the optimum place to live on the planet, but where

192
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,860
more specifically should our world city go?

193
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,900
Well, this region is already in the northern hemisphere and in Eurasia so we've already

194
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,120
covered those two criteria.

195
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,760
We want a place within 100 or so miles of the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains

196
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
with rich mineral deposits.

197
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,480
The single best place for a city on earth just might be Dhaka, Bangladesh.

198
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,920
Every geographic model and theory says that there is no better place on earth to put a

199
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,240
city than here.

200
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,120
There's evidence to back this up.

201
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,280
Dhaka is between the 4th and the 18th largest metropolitan area on earth depending on how

202
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,600
you define metropolitan area and Bangladesh is the 6th densest country on earth.

203
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:30,260
There are 161 million people living in an area of about the size of England.

204
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,800
History has affected geography enough that the largest and most advanced civilizations

205
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,980
are not all in south-central Asia, but if we started all over again, did humanity a

206
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,400
second time, every geographic model says that this region could be the origin and central

207
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,560
point of human civilization.

208
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,920
I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.

209
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,480
This video was made possible by my amazing, brand new sponsor, Squarespace.

210
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,400
Squarespace is an all-in-one platform to make your beautiful, professional website.

211
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,920
Months before Squarespace signed on to sponsor Wendover Productions, I used them to make

212
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,960
my website—WendoverProductions.com.

213
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,440
Now I wasn't looking for anything fancy, I just wanted to make sure that nobody else

214
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,000
could get their hands on the WendoverProductions.com domain and also to create a great looking

215
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,280
landing page.

216
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,520
This way I could give people one link that goes to all my different social accounts.

217
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,960
I know that most of you guys are smart, upstart, entrepreneurial people that want to make your

218
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,280
mark and what's so much more professional than a LinkedIn or Twitter or Facebook account

219
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,000
is a standalone website and it's cheaper than you'd think.

220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,140
Especially because if you sign up using the link Squarespace.com slash Wendover and use

221
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,060
the code WENDOVER in your order, you'll get 10% off.

222
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,720
This is hopefully the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship between Wendover

223
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,120
Productions and Squarespace.

224
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,880
They're really committed to helping independent creators like me and perhaps you make great

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,600
things, so definitely take a look at what they have to offer and make your next move

226
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
with Squarespace.

227
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,920
You can support Wendover Productions by contributing on Patreon where 100% of the funds go right

228
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,320
back into the channel.

229
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,440
I even release expense reports at the end of each month.

230
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,400
You can also get great rewards over there like early access to videos, stickers, handwritten

231
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,760
letters, and most recently, t-shirts.

232
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,280
You can also order a t-shirt by itself for only $20 through DFTBA.

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,900
The link is here and also in the description.

234
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,160
