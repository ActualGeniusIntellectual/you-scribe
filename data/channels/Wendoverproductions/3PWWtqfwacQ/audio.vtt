This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Squarespace.

00:04.600 --> 00:08.520

00:08.520 --> 00:14.200
The Cumberland Valley is home to six towns lying between Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisburg,

00:14.200 --> 00:19.600
Pennsylvania—Greencastle, Chambersburg, Shippensburg, Newville, Carlisle, and Mechanicsburg.

00:19.600 --> 00:24.560
What's exceptional about these small Pennsylvania towns is that they're each almost exactly

00:24.560 --> 00:26.320
ten miles from each other.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.640
The distances deviate by no more than a mile from this rule.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.440
This isn't a coincidence and this isn't planned.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.760
Drawing equal sized radii around each town shows you their spheres of influence.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.840
Assuming each town has the exact same shops and services, rational people will go to whichever

00:43.840 --> 00:47.220
town is closest to buy or sell goods.

00:47.220 --> 00:52.020
Towns ten miles apart mean that nobody has to travel more than five miles to reach a

00:52.020 --> 00:53.020
town.

00:53.020 --> 00:57.140
Each of these towns was founded before the formation of the United States so that means

00:57.140 --> 01:02.020
that, of course, nobody had cars and pretty much everybody walked everywhere.

01:02.020 --> 01:07.100
Ten miles, or five miles each way, is about the distance a person can comfortably walk

01:07.100 --> 01:11.580
in a day with enough time to buy or sell goods at a central market.

01:11.580 --> 01:16.140
Back in this era before cars, a five mile radius was essentially the largest possible

01:16.140 --> 01:21.640
commuter zone to small agricultural towns and therefore having towns ten miles apart

01:21.640 --> 01:25.260
was the most efficient possible use of rural land.

01:25.260 --> 01:29.920
When you get the chance, take a look at a map of a rural area that existed before cars.

01:29.920 --> 01:34.800
You'll see that the distance between medium sized towns is almost always somewhere between

01:34.800 --> 01:37.600
about ten to fifteen miles.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.320
Because the Cumberland Valley is a valley, towns really could only develop in a line,

01:42.320 --> 01:45.680
but in most cases towns develop in all directions.

01:45.680 --> 01:49.360
This is what the ten mile rule looks like when going out in all directions.

01:49.360 --> 01:53.740
Each of these points is a town and the hexagon around it is the area from which people will

01:53.740 --> 01:55.160
go to the town.

01:55.160 --> 02:00.320
In the real world, each of these towns probably has a small grocery store, a pharmacy, a bank,

02:00.320 --> 02:01.680
and maybe a restaurant.

02:01.680 --> 02:06.400
Since everybody uses these services, there doesn't have to be many people in a town's

02:06.400 --> 02:09.780
sphere of influence in order to sustain these shops.

02:09.780 --> 02:13.360
But where do you put something more specialized, like a mechanic?

02:13.360 --> 02:17.160
People only need to go to the mechanic every once in a while so you need more people to

02:17.160 --> 02:20.320
sustain one mechanic shop than one grocery store.

02:20.320 --> 02:25.120
Well, some of these small towns develop into larger towns with more people that can support

02:25.120 --> 02:27.980
more specialized shops and services.

02:27.980 --> 02:32.560
Putting these larger towns with more specialized shops closer together would be unsustainable

02:32.560 --> 02:36.400
since there wouldn't be enough people going to those shops, but putting them farther apart

02:36.400 --> 02:40.660
would be inefficient since there's land that people would not go to a city from.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.960
This happens once or twice more until you have cities.

02:43.960 --> 02:48.520
These cities have the largest spheres of influence and the most specialized shops.

02:48.520 --> 02:52.720
You of course still have grocery stores and pharmacies in cities, but you also have things

02:52.720 --> 02:56.740
like luxury car dealerships, brain surgery centers, and airports.

02:56.740 --> 03:02.280
The city's sphere of influence is enormous because people will travel hundreds of miles

03:02.280 --> 03:06.920
to buy an expensive car or get brain surgery or fly from an airport.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.400
Think about it within a city.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.540
How far would you walk to buy a latte?

03:11.540 --> 03:15.700
Probably only a few blocks, and that's why you see Starbucks or other coffee shops

03:15.700 --> 03:17.520
on almost every block.

03:17.520 --> 03:22.200
Since almost everyone buys coffee, you only need a few blocks of people to sustain one

03:22.200 --> 03:23.580
coffee shop.

03:23.580 --> 03:26.120
But how far would you walk to buy a MacBook?

03:26.120 --> 03:29.900
Probably quite far since it's an infrequent and substantial purchase.

03:29.900 --> 03:33.780
That's why Apple stores are rather rare even in cities.

03:33.780 --> 03:38.940
You need an enormous amount of people to sustain one Apple store and we can actually figure

03:38.940 --> 03:40.620
out roughly how many.

03:40.620 --> 03:45.180
In Connecticut, the Trumbull Apple Store is about 20 miles away from the New Haven store

03:45.180 --> 03:48.180
to the northeast and the Stanford store to the southwest.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.940
In the 10 mile radius around the Trumbull Apple Store, there are about half a million

03:51.940 --> 03:57.140
inhabitants, which tells us that you need about half a million people to sustain one

03:57.140 --> 03:58.180
Apple store.

03:58.180 --> 04:02.340
We can compare that to the Starbucks's of lower Manhattan which are spread out at an

04:02.340 --> 04:04.920
average distance of about 600 feet.

04:04.920 --> 04:11.420
Drawing a 300 foot radius around one Starbucks in lower Manhattan covers about 6,000 people

04:11.420 --> 04:15.680
which means that one Starbucks needs 6,000 people to sustain it.

04:15.680 --> 04:19.920
Of course, both Connecticut and New York are places with higher than average incomes which

04:19.920 --> 04:23.840
means that less people are needed to sustain one Starbucks or Apple store.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.420
The numbers would be very different in, say, rural Kansas, but since each store generally

04:28.420 --> 04:32.960
only builds in areas with higher than average incomes, this gives a good sense of how many

04:33.000 --> 04:37.520
people Apple and Starbucks look for in an area before opening up a store.

04:37.520 --> 04:43.180
So, our model shows where cities should be, but it's not like this in reality.

04:43.180 --> 04:45.620
This is the most efficient spread of cities.

04:45.620 --> 04:50.920
If you're assuming that cities are on a perfectly flat plain with no geographic features,

04:50.920 --> 04:56.300
no social influences, no variability of income, equal distribution of resources, essentially

04:56.300 --> 05:00.620
assuming the world is one homogeneous place, which it's not.

05:00.620 --> 05:06.740
In reality, of course, our world has an enormous effect on where and why cities develop.

05:06.740 --> 05:11.900
To start out, let's cut this down to one city on a flat, featureless plain for simplicity.

05:11.900 --> 05:15.380
What affects the location of cities more than anything is water.

05:15.380 --> 05:20.380
If we put an ocean on one side of our isotropic plain, our city will almost certainly locate

05:20.380 --> 05:21.580
near it.

05:21.580 --> 05:24.820
Oceans have always been and still are what connects the world.

05:24.820 --> 05:29.620
There's no other means of transport that can move such enormous amounts of cargo for

05:29.620 --> 05:30.900
so little.

05:30.900 --> 05:35.860
Any city needs to be economically efficient to grow and it will cost more to bring goods

05:35.860 --> 05:40.620
to a city that's a thousand miles inland than one right by the ocean.

05:40.620 --> 05:41.820
Just look at Europe.

05:41.820 --> 05:46.820
Six of the ten largest European cities are within 100 miles of the coast, but oceans

05:46.820 --> 05:49.800
aren't the only bodies of water to affect cities.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.180
Rivers are just as or perhaps even more influential.

05:53.180 --> 05:58.540
Milan, the 19th largest European city, is the largest to not be either directly on the

05:58.540 --> 06:04.100
ocean or on a river and even then it's only 15 miles from a river and 75 miles from

06:04.100 --> 06:05.100
the ocean.

06:05.100 --> 06:10.320
Until the last century or so, cities could not survive without direct water access.

06:10.320 --> 06:15.540
If you need more proof, 14 of the 15 largest cities in the world are within a few dozen

06:15.540 --> 06:17.360
miles of the ocean.

06:17.360 --> 06:22.120
Perhaps the most obvious attractor for cities is resources so going back to our isotropic

06:22.120 --> 06:27.020
plain, putting natural resources anywhere on this map will draw cities near it.

06:27.020 --> 06:32.040
Cities that existed before the last century or so generally sprung up right near the resources,

06:32.040 --> 06:37.700
much like Pittsburgh since they acted as manufacturing and transportation hubs for those resources,

06:37.700 --> 06:42.100
but more recently, new resource-dependent cities don't need to be as close to the

06:42.100 --> 06:43.720
resources themselves.

06:43.720 --> 06:48.020
New transportation technologies can bring the resources from their source.

06:48.020 --> 06:49.300
Just look at Dubai.

06:49.300 --> 06:53.980
Of course the UAE has enormous oil deposits, but they're much closer to Abu Dhabi and

06:53.980 --> 06:56.340
the southwest than Dubai.

06:56.340 --> 07:02.580
In 1900, Dubai had 10,000 residents—less than half that of Carlisle, Pennsylvania,

07:02.580 --> 07:05.300
one of the farming towns we talked about at the beginning.

07:05.300 --> 07:12.940
That only grew to 40,000 by 1960, but today it's known worldwide and has more than 2.5

07:12.940 --> 07:13.940
million residents.

07:13.940 --> 07:19.180
It was able to grow at this enormous rate, even faster than Abu Dhabi, since it cemented

07:19.180 --> 07:24.380
itself as the economic and administrative hub for the oil industries of the region.

07:24.420 --> 07:27.660
Another geographic feature that we can add to the plane is mountains.

07:27.660 --> 07:32.180
Now, mountains don't always have a uniform effect on cities.

07:32.180 --> 07:39.100
Mexico City, Bogota, and Addis Ababa are all enormous cities at elevations above 7,000

07:39.100 --> 07:40.100
feet.

07:40.100 --> 07:44.860
Mountains do make transport and trade difficult, but they also provide protection.

07:44.860 --> 07:49.380
Many ancient cities grew in these locations since they were easy to protect which left

07:49.380 --> 07:54.660
more time to focus on growing the city, but mountains can also hinder development.

07:54.660 --> 07:59.240
For quite a while, the United States could not develop west of the Appalachian Mountains.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.100
They just served as an enormous barrier.

08:02.100 --> 08:08.060
In 1800, the average center of population for the entire United States was here even

08:08.060 --> 08:11.740
though the US had sovereignty over this entire area.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.860
Of course technology eventually conquered this barrier and moved the mean population

08:15.860 --> 08:20.340
center all the way out to Missouri today, but if the Appalachian Mountains didn't

08:20.340 --> 08:24.760
exist, American history and geography would be completely different.

08:24.760 --> 08:28.740
We would have seen urban development much earlier in the midwest, but mountains can

08:28.740 --> 08:30.580
also have another effect.

08:30.580 --> 08:36.300
You see, coal, silver, gold, and other mineral deposits are all often located in mountainous

08:36.300 --> 08:41.180
regions, and, just like Dubai, cities can develop in less hospitable and easy places

08:41.180 --> 08:42.680
due to resources.

08:42.680 --> 08:47.600
The economic advantage of exploiting the resources overpowers the economic disadvantage

08:47.600 --> 08:50.200
of being in an inhospitable location.

08:50.200 --> 08:57.360
Denver, Colorado grew 650% between 1870 and 1880 with the opening of a railroad branch

08:57.360 --> 08:59.960
connecting with a transcontinental railroad.

08:59.960 --> 09:04.560
It served as an access point to transportation to the gold miners in the Rockies.

09:04.560 --> 09:09.360
So, mountains can either push cities away or bring them nearer—it really just depends

09:09.360 --> 09:10.360
on the circumstance.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.080
Let's exchange our isotropic plane for a world map.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.760
Where should cities be on here?

09:15.760 --> 09:22.360
Well, our world's cities are not necessarily in all the most geographically efficient locations.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.400
While there is a certain level of natural selection that grows the efficiently placed

09:26.400 --> 09:30.720
cities and shrinks the inefficiently placed cities, humans are not always able to put

09:30.720 --> 09:33.360
cities in the most efficient locations.

09:33.360 --> 09:38.540
Let's put up the 224 cities in the world with a population over 2 million.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.820
You can immediately see some patterns.

09:40.820 --> 09:44.100
Putting up the equator, you can see there's a clear divide.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.900
Only 32 of these cities lie in the southern hemisphere.

09:47.900 --> 09:52.540
One might think that this is because there is so much more land in the northern hemisphere,

09:52.540 --> 09:54.400
but that's not entirely true.

09:54.400 --> 10:00.560
You see, the southern hemisphere still has 32% of the world's land, but only has 14%

10:00.560 --> 10:02.180
of the world's large cities.

10:02.180 --> 10:06.540
There's clearly a higher density of cities in the northern hemisphere.

10:06.540 --> 10:09.700
You can pretty much trace this all back to Europe and Asia.

10:09.700 --> 10:14.360
The first large civilizations and empires were on these two continents even though the

10:14.360 --> 10:17.260
human race likely originated in Africa.

10:17.260 --> 10:21.740
There's hundreds of different theories on why civilizations succeeded in some places

10:21.740 --> 10:25.900
and failed in others, but one of the more plausible and interesting theories is that

10:25.900 --> 10:29.800
Europe and Asia succeeded because they're wide instead of tall.

10:29.800 --> 10:34.060
The very shape of continents may have changed the course of human history.

10:34.060 --> 10:39.900
You see, when a continent is wide, you have a ton of land with roughly the same climate.

10:39.900 --> 10:43.980
Climate tends to change when you go north and south rather than east and west as a nature

10:43.980 --> 10:46.560
of how the earth rotates around the sun.

10:46.560 --> 10:50.940
Much of the success of early civilizations had to do with the domestication of plants

10:50.940 --> 10:53.580
and animals and the corresponding technology.

10:53.580 --> 10:57.700
When expanding horizontally, the climate is similar enough that an empire can use the

10:57.700 --> 11:03.160
same successful plants and animals while expanding vertically requires the domestication of new

11:03.160 --> 11:04.880
plants and animals.

11:04.880 --> 11:09.680
If a civilization started in Central America, for example, there would be very little land

11:09.680 --> 11:14.820
on the continent with a similar climate and their expansion would be severely limited.

11:14.820 --> 11:20.180
In Europe and Asia, on the other hand, there's thousands upon thousands of miles of similar

11:20.180 --> 11:24.340
climate that can be reached just by traveling east or west.

11:24.340 --> 11:29.200
Just look at the maps of the four largest early empires—the Qing Dynasty, the Abbasid

11:29.200 --> 11:32.900
Caliphate, the Umayyad Caliphate, and the Mongol Empire.

11:32.900 --> 11:36.940
They were all in Eurasia and they all expanded horizontally.

11:36.940 --> 11:42.620
When some of the more modern empires expanded, they had the technology to do so overseas.

11:42.620 --> 11:47.380
The three major modern empires were the British, Spanish, and French empires, each of which

11:47.380 --> 11:49.660
came from relatively similar climates.

11:49.660 --> 11:55.300
A major reason why America was able to succeed is because all the agriculture from Europe

11:55.300 --> 11:56.620
worked there.

11:56.620 --> 12:00.340
Climactically, Europe and America are nearly identical.

12:00.340 --> 12:04.600
The majority of developed colonized countries are in the northern hemisphere just because

12:04.600 --> 12:09.660
they were closest to Europe, but formerly British countries like South Africa, Australia,

12:09.660 --> 12:13.380
and New Zealand are all highly developed and in the southern hemisphere.

12:13.380 --> 12:17.840
Their success over more northern countries in the southern hemisphere can also be partially

12:17.840 --> 12:21.100
attributed to their greater climate similarity to Europe.

12:21.100 --> 12:23.500
Let's ask one more question.

12:23.500 --> 12:27.900
If our world only had one city, where would it logically be?

12:27.900 --> 12:32.940
Well, if you take the location of every person in the world and average it out, you come

12:32.940 --> 12:35.060
to south-central Asia.

12:35.060 --> 12:40.440
That means that this general region is the optimum place to live on the planet, but where

12:40.440 --> 12:43.860
more specifically should our world city go?

12:43.860 --> 12:48.900
Well, this region is already in the northern hemisphere and in Eurasia so we've already

12:48.900 --> 12:51.120
covered those two criteria.

12:51.120 --> 12:56.760
We want a place within 100 or so miles of the ocean, on a navigable river, near mountains

12:56.760 --> 12:58.760
with rich mineral deposits.

12:58.760 --> 13:04.480
The single best place for a city on earth just might be Dhaka, Bangladesh.

13:04.480 --> 13:09.920
Every geographic model and theory says that there is no better place on earth to put a

13:09.920 --> 13:11.240
city than here.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.120
There's evidence to back this up.

13:13.120 --> 13:18.280
Dhaka is between the 4th and the 18th largest metropolitan area on earth depending on how

13:18.280 --> 13:23.600
you define metropolitan area and Bangladesh is the 6th densest country on earth.

13:23.600 --> 13:30.260
There are 161 million people living in an area of about the size of England.

13:30.260 --> 13:34.800
History has affected geography enough that the largest and most advanced civilizations

13:34.800 --> 13:39.980
are not all in south-central Asia, but if we started all over again, did humanity a

13:39.980 --> 13:46.400
second time, every geographic model says that this region could be the origin and central

13:46.400 --> 13:49.560
point of human civilization.

13:49.560 --> 13:52.920
I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.

13:52.920 --> 13:58.480
This video was made possible by my amazing, brand new sponsor, Squarespace.

13:58.480 --> 14:03.400
Squarespace is an all-in-one platform to make your beautiful, professional website.

14:03.400 --> 14:07.920
Months before Squarespace signed on to sponsor Wendover Productions, I used them to make

14:07.920 --> 14:10.960
my website—WendoverProductions.com.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.440
Now I wasn't looking for anything fancy, I just wanted to make sure that nobody else

14:14.440 --> 14:19.000
could get their hands on the WendoverProductions.com domain and also to create a great looking

14:19.000 --> 14:20.280
landing page.

14:20.280 --> 14:24.520
This way I could give people one link that goes to all my different social accounts.

14:24.520 --> 14:28.960
I know that most of you guys are smart, upstart, entrepreneurial people that want to make your

14:28.960 --> 14:33.280
mark and what's so much more professional than a LinkedIn or Twitter or Facebook account

14:33.280 --> 14:37.000
is a standalone website and it's cheaper than you'd think.

14:37.000 --> 14:41.140
Especially because if you sign up using the link Squarespace.com slash Wendover and use

14:41.140 --> 14:45.060
the code WENDOVER in your order, you'll get 10% off.

14:45.060 --> 14:48.720
This is hopefully the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship between Wendover

14:48.720 --> 14:50.120
Productions and Squarespace.

14:50.120 --> 14:54.880
They're really committed to helping independent creators like me and perhaps you make great

14:54.880 --> 14:58.600
things, so definitely take a look at what they have to offer and make your next move

14:58.600 --> 14:59.880
with Squarespace.

14:59.880 --> 15:04.920
You can support Wendover Productions by contributing on Patreon where 100% of the funds go right

15:04.920 --> 15:06.320
back into the channel.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.440
I even release expense reports at the end of each month.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.400
You can also get great rewards over there like early access to videos, stickers, handwritten

15:14.400 --> 15:16.760
letters, and most recently, t-shirts.

15:16.760 --> 15:21.280
You can also order a t-shirt by itself for only $20 through DFTBA.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.900
The link is here and also in the description.

15:23.900 --> 15:28.160
Other than that, please make sure to follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro, watch my last

15:28.160 --> 15:33.120

and most of all, subscribe to this channel to receive all my future videos right when

15:37.060 --> 15:38.060
they come out.

15:42.200 --> 15:42.700
video.
