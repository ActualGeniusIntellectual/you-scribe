00:00.560 --> 00:06.400
This is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. It's a dark ride that opened in 2010 at Universal

00:06.400 --> 00:11.680
Studios' Islands of Adventure. It seats four to a bench, it lasts approximately four minutes,

00:11.680 --> 00:18.880
six seconds, and it changed theme parks forever. Functionally, the ride didn't reinvent the wheel.

00:18.880 --> 00:24.880
Rather than technological invention, it relied on innovative amalgamation. Unlike any before it,

00:24.880 --> 00:30.160
the ride married tracks, robotic arms, wraparound screens, and film shots exclusively for the

00:30.160 --> 00:34.320
attraction to create a deeply intimate, individualized tour through a universe

00:34.320 --> 00:40.720
previously inaccessible outside of imagination. Guests loved it—they just couldn't explain it.

00:41.360 --> 00:46.320
From TV interviews to enthusiast blogs, the consensus was that you just have to experience

00:46.320 --> 00:51.200
it yourself. This sentiment extended beyond the ride. From the Wizarding World's entrance,

00:51.200 --> 00:55.840
where designers manipulated sightlines to foster a false sense of expanse, to the food, beverage,

00:55.840 --> 01:00.320
and merchandise—be it a pint of butterbeer or a wool sweater straight out of the movies—the

01:00.320 --> 01:06.240
20-acre plot didn't just look like Harry Potter, it felt like Harry Potter. For a few hours,

01:06.240 --> 01:10.880
disbelief went suspended as visitors rode rides, snapped pictures with in-character actors,

01:10.880 --> 01:16.480
and got sighs for wands, happily spending money all the while. The expansion became the park's

01:16.480 --> 01:23.520
crown jewel. In the year following its opening, park attendance jumped a staggering 66%. Tourists

01:23.520 --> 01:28.960
snatched up Harry Potter sweaters in the Florida heat, and stuffed $55 wands into carry-ons.

01:28.960 --> 01:34.640
Through bold innovation, Universal had effectively beat Disney at its own game. Visitors were now

01:34.640 --> 01:39.920
planning trips around Universal Studios and, if they had the time, would check out Disney World 2.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.880
The thing about Disney, though, is that when they lose, they don't stay down for long.

01:45.760 --> 01:51.680
For Disney, the insane success of Universal's Harry Potter park was a massive what-if. More

01:51.680 --> 01:56.160
accurately, in hindsight, it was a massive mistake, because the rights to a Harry Potter

01:56.160 --> 02:01.440
theme park had nearly been theirs. J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. had signed a letter of intent

02:01.440 --> 02:07.200
to build out a Harry Potter world with Disney in 2004. Then, according to insiders, Disney got cold

02:07.200 --> 02:12.400
feet over concerns on Rowling's creative control and because the project seemed too expensive.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.960
A deeply immersive and experiential park design was just too much for Disney to stomach,

02:16.960 --> 02:21.440
so Rowling went to Universal, who, for their part, harbored reservations as well.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.960
What this 49-page document makes clear is that J.K. Rowling had little interest in settling for

02:26.960 --> 02:32.160
the status quo. Rather, the licensing agreement between Universal and Warner Bros. ensured that

02:32.160 --> 02:36.640
the park would mirror Rowling's vision and ambition. With everything from the property's

02:36.640 --> 02:42.160
artwork, structures, and design, to the food, merchandise, and ads, the author had final

02:42.160 --> 02:46.000
approval rights. Anything with visible third-party branding, on the other hand,

02:46.000 --> 02:50.640
was subject to disapproval by the author, while third-party logos require the author's prior

02:50.640 --> 02:55.440
written consent. And not only would the park be authentic, it would be standard-setting,

02:55.440 --> 02:59.040
as the agreement stipulated that Universal would invest in maintaining a quote,

02:59.040 --> 03:03.360
first-class, world-class-level themed area unsurpassed by any other.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.880
Developing unique, unbranded food, beverage, and merchandise, while partnered with manufacturers

03:08.880 --> 03:14.160
and soda companies, proved tricky. Such novelty simply hadn't been employed before, and Universal

03:14.160 --> 03:18.480
chafed under Rowling's requirements. Stacks of Harry Potter books were ever-present and

03:18.480 --> 03:22.720
oft-referenced in creative meetings, while Alan Gilmore, an art director for the films,

03:22.720 --> 03:26.880
went ahead and moved to the US to consult on the park's development. In the past,

03:26.880 --> 03:31.440
directors like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron had come on at Universal and Disney to advise,

03:31.520 --> 03:35.840
but this was different—their themed additions served Coke and Pepsi, not Butterbeer.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.760
Rowling's centrality and authority was simply unprecedented, and for Universal it proved a

03:41.760 --> 03:47.520
frustrating process. But as with the books, Rowling's vision was on point, and the park's

03:47.520 --> 03:50.800
popped—not in spite of the constraints, but because of them.

03:51.360 --> 03:56.240
Meanwhile, while Universal set attendance records, Disney reopened an upgraded attraction of their

03:56.240 --> 04:01.520
own in 2011. Star Tours, a Star Wars ride that had been stuffing guests onto half-million-dollar

04:01.520 --> 04:06.560
flight simulators and flying them through movie scenes since 1987, now boasted an expanded list

04:06.560 --> 04:11.840
of plotlines to celebrate the conclusion of the prequel trilogy. The revamped ride hardly made

04:11.840 --> 04:18.480
waves, but it gave Disney CEO Bob Iger a chance to speak with George Lucas. Months later, Disney

04:18.480 --> 04:24.880
announced the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm. Among other things, the massive move signaled

04:24.880 --> 04:29.520
that Disney was positioning itself to take on Universal's game-changing theme land.

04:29.520 --> 04:34.400
As Iger explained to stockholders, quote, our Lucasfilm valuation is almost entirely driven

04:34.400 --> 04:39.120
by the Star Wars franchise, and that he expected to quote, utilize Star Wars in other businesses,

04:39.120 --> 04:44.080
including parks and resorts, in games, and in our television business. What Disney had learned with

04:44.080 --> 04:48.800
the lukewarm launch of Cars Land in 2012 was that if they were to make a Wizarding World-sized

04:48.800 --> 04:54.000
splash, they needed a fictional world that people wanted to get lost in. With Star Wars,

04:54.000 --> 04:59.600
they finally had it. After some decade of planning, years of construction, and a billion

04:59.600 --> 05:05.280
dollars in bills, the Star Wars universe's newest expansion was finally ready to open for business.

05:05.840 --> 05:11.200
Fans flew in from far, far away to amass at Disney's gates in the early hours of May 31st,

05:11.200 --> 05:16.720
2019. Come 8am, the most committed early risers were escorted through the park to the entrance

05:16.720 --> 05:22.320
of Black Spire Outpost. What they found on the other side was one of the most complex,

05:22.320 --> 05:26.560
most expensive, and most ambitious theme park expansions ever.

05:27.280 --> 05:33.520
Star Wars Galaxy Edge is unlike anything ever built before, with one notable exception. Taking

05:33.520 --> 05:37.440
a page out of Universal's playbook and building on the success of the Wizarding World of Harry

05:37.440 --> 05:43.440
Potter, this wasn't a land inspired by jungles or fairy tales or Jules Verne's vision of the future.

05:43.440 --> 05:49.280
This was the physical embodiment of Star Wars. Seeing the success of bringing Hogsmeade and

05:49.280 --> 05:54.640
Diagon Alley into the real world, this was a trading outpost on the frontier planet Batuu,

05:54.640 --> 05:59.520
a fully-fledged element of Star Wars canon, brought into reality thanks to the deepest

05:59.520 --> 06:05.360
level of theming ever seen at a Disney park. Each of the 1,600 employees, or cast members

06:05.360 --> 06:09.520
working within the land, from the actors in stormtrooper costumes to the cashiers at the

06:09.520 --> 06:14.720
merchandise shops, has a unique backstory that, thanks to improvisation classes included in their

06:14.720 --> 06:20.560
training, reflects in how they interact with guests. They use unique themed terminology—cell

06:20.560 --> 06:24.240
phones are data pads, water fountains are hydrators, bathrooms are refreshers,

06:24.240 --> 06:28.800
and bright suns means good morning. The food—smoked kadu ribs, blue milk,

06:28.800 --> 06:33.680
mustafarian lava rolls, and plenty more—all reflect what Star Wars characters might eat

06:33.680 --> 06:38.480
during the refueling stop on Batuu. Drinks are sold in special, themed containers,

06:38.480 --> 06:43.360
with Coke, Sprite, and Dasani written in the fictional Oribesh alphabet from Star Wars.

06:43.360 --> 06:47.840
Functional areas like bathrooms are fully themed too, with a design that looks nothing like the

06:47.840 --> 06:52.160
Earthly equivalents. Even the receipts from the various shops reflect the fact that they're from

06:52.160 --> 06:57.440
Blackspire Outpost, rather than Disney World or Land. Disney kept the outside world out to a

06:57.440 --> 07:02.480
greater extent than any of its lands had ever before, mirrored only by Universal's Wizarding

07:02.480 --> 07:06.640
World of Harry Potter. While Universal's case might have been spurred forward by the author's

07:06.640 --> 07:11.600
deep creative control, both parks ingeniously shifted their strategies to capitalize on one

07:11.600 --> 07:15.280
of the most dramatic shifts in the way consumers consume ever.

07:16.160 --> 07:22.160
In short, young people aren't buying things, they're buying experiences. Year-over-year

07:22.160 --> 07:27.200
spending growth on spectator sports, amusement parks, live entertainment, and travel has far

07:27.200 --> 07:32.960
outpaced overall spending growth. While the average baby boomer devotes $134 to experiences

07:32.960 --> 07:39.520
in a given month, millennials, a far less wealthy cohort, spend $164. While the reasons behind the

07:39.520 --> 07:44.160
shifts go far beyond a single factor, no small part can be attributed to the rise of social

07:44.160 --> 07:48.800
media. Younger people want to live a life that portrays well online, and that mimics the purportedly

07:48.800 --> 07:54.000
idyllic lives portrayed by others on social media. Disney was a foundational element of the

07:54.000 --> 07:58.960
experience economy before this term was even defined, but not in a way that fit the 21st

07:58.960 --> 08:04.320
century conception of it. Airbnb, for example, grew off of individuals' desire to stay somewhere

08:04.320 --> 08:09.120
unique rather than a cookie cutter hotel room. Supreme became a hot commodity by making the

08:09.120 --> 08:13.760
buying experience one where a select number of people felt privileged for having completed it.

08:13.760 --> 08:18.480
Experiences have to be unique to be considered true experiences, and being one of tens of

08:18.480 --> 08:24.000
thousands to pass through Space Mountain on a given day isn't unique. Therefore, every element

08:24.000 --> 08:29.360
of Galaxy's Edge, from big to small, was designed around providing each guest a unique experience.

08:29.920 --> 08:35.440
To start, the winding streets restrict eyelines so that one can only see so far ahead. That nudges

08:35.440 --> 08:40.800
guests to explore, and once they reach the core of the land they find a complex maze of streets.

08:40.800 --> 08:46.000
Theme parks are specifically designed so that guests get just a little bit lost. This helps

08:46.000 --> 08:50.080
promote a sense of exploration as they move around, and obfuscating people's mental maps

08:50.080 --> 08:55.200
typically defaults them to perceiving a place as larger than it actually is. Another concept that

08:55.200 --> 09:00.640
differs in Galaxy's Edge relative to other lands is that of the payoff. Payoff is what designers

09:00.640 --> 09:06.480
use to refer to anything cool, fun, or unique that a guest will enjoy finding. In more traditional

09:06.480 --> 09:11.680
theme park design, the payoffs are big, but don't always live up to their promise. In its early

09:11.680 --> 09:16.080
years, Sleeping Beauty's Castle was a major payoff for entering the park, but guests were often

09:16.080 --> 09:20.160
disappointed to learn that they couldn't enter the structure. Disney eventually fixes this by

09:20.160 --> 09:24.320
adding an interior, but is perpetually weighed towards overselling and underdelivering with its

09:24.320 --> 09:31.040
major exterior elements… until Galaxy's Edge. The entrances of the land do very little to sell it.

09:31.040 --> 09:35.760
While most lands typically open to a big, expansive, impressive view, Galaxy's Edge's

09:35.760 --> 09:41.120
entrances push in towards fairly tight, unimpressive areas. Then, smaller payoffs like

09:41.120 --> 09:45.440
ships, droids, and characters are scattered throughout, rewarding exploration, and finally,

09:45.440 --> 09:50.160
the biggest payoff, the Millennium Falcon, is only found after a guest adequately navigates

09:50.160 --> 09:55.840
the streets of Black Spire Outpost. In the process of exploration, guests find the design elements

09:55.840 --> 10:01.280
that further promote individualized experiences. The typical problem with individualized offerings

10:01.280 --> 10:06.000
is that they're almost impossible to scale, and theme parks' profitability is all based on

10:06.000 --> 10:11.200
offering entertainment at scale. Galaxy's Edge fixes this paradox by directly monetizing the

10:11.200 --> 10:15.840
individual, unscalable experiences. With the land themed as a trading outpost,

10:15.840 --> 10:20.560
Disney is able to incorporate retail without straying from the plot. Guests wait through

10:20.560 --> 10:26.640
long lines for the privilege of spending $219.99 to enter a workshop where cast members guide

10:26.640 --> 10:31.600
customers through a highly-themed experience of assembling a custom lightsaber. Similar lines

10:31.600 --> 10:36.240
regularly stretch outside of a shop where galactic consumers can assemble their own droid, or outside

10:36.240 --> 10:40.640
the entrance of the purportedly notorious Ogas Cantina, where visitors can enjoy some of the

10:40.640 --> 10:46.240
universe's famed drinks. Guests can even exchange their dollars for the local Batuian Spira, which

10:46.240 --> 10:51.200
is legal tender throughout the land. Through this, the park encourages all to spend more,

10:51.200 --> 10:55.600
and is also able to effectively sell worthless pieces of metal, considering many will take some

10:55.600 --> 11:01.200
Spira home. Essentially, Disney has created a land where to live like a Star Wars character,

11:01.200 --> 11:06.720
to get the individualized experience everyone wants, guests have to shop like a Star Wars

11:06.720 --> 11:11.520
character. But of course, for Galaxy's Edge to exist as a theme park land,

11:11.520 --> 11:16.400
it must have some theme park rides. But continuing to capitalize on the changing

11:16.400 --> 11:21.920
business environment, Disney was able to build an attraction unlike anything ever attempted before.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.880
It's called Star Wars Rise of the Resistance, and uniquely, it's not one that can be succinctly

11:26.880 --> 11:32.240
summarized by describing it as a rollercoaster or a simulator or a drop tower. The need for

11:32.240 --> 11:37.360
highly marketable attractions has long worked in opposition to designers' desire to create the best

11:37.360 --> 11:41.920
experiences. That's in large part because marketing teams continuously push designers

11:41.920 --> 11:46.640
to create world firsts, but doing something new only rarely translates into doing something

11:46.640 --> 11:51.840
better. For example, England's Alton Towers theme park has long featured the Galactica coaster,

11:51.840 --> 11:57.520
which is regularly ranked as one of the world's 50 best. In 2016, after the park's winter closure,

11:57.520 --> 12:02.640
the ride reopened refurbished as the world's first virtual reality rollercoaster. Guests would

12:02.640 --> 12:06.720
don headsets to simulate a ride through space, which earned the park coverage by Engadget,

12:06.720 --> 12:13.920
CNET, Wire, the LA Times, and more media outlets. Ultimately, though, guests hated it. The need to

12:13.920 --> 12:18.160
fit everyone with headsets increased wait times dramatically, and people didn't feel like the VR

12:18.160 --> 12:23.520
experience made that wait worthwhile. Therefore, after three seasons, the headsets were removed,

12:23.520 --> 12:29.120
and Galactica was reverted into a regular coaster. Disney, meanwhile, has recognized that rides no

12:29.120 --> 12:33.840
longer must be marketed through traditional means using a phrase as simple as the world's first VR

12:33.840 --> 12:39.680
rollercoaster, and so the Imagineers behind Rise of the Resistance embraced the value of complexity.

12:39.680 --> 12:44.480
The ride starts with guests entering a briefing room, where a hologram sets up what's to come.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.000
Riders are told that they're new recruits fighting for the Resistance, and are soon

12:48.000 --> 12:52.480
ushered onto a transport ship bound for the planet Pekara. These ships are essentially

12:52.480 --> 12:56.240
simulator pods that provide light motion that matches what's seen through the windows.

12:56.240 --> 13:01.280
However, the plot progresses with the ship being captured by an enemy First Order star destroyer,

13:01.280 --> 13:05.840
meaning guests must exit into an area different from where they entered. To achieve this,

13:05.840 --> 13:10.960
there are actually three simulator pods positioned on a giant turntable. Once the doors are closed,

13:10.960 --> 13:15.760
the turntable spins about a third, timed up with the movement of the ship rotating upon takeoff.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.600
Then, it makes its second movement as the ship is getting pulled in by a tractor beam,

13:19.600 --> 13:23.040
so guests don't feel like the motion is out of place, and exit from the door through which

13:23.040 --> 13:28.640
they entered into an entirely new space—a massive, cavernous room filled with dozens

13:28.640 --> 13:33.200
of stormtroopers. Next, cast members quickly order guests into an interrogation room,

13:33.200 --> 13:37.360
where a door is eventually cut into the side by Resistance fighters, and the captive recruits

13:37.360 --> 13:42.640
are quickly shepherded onto two ride vehicles. Now, for this attraction, Disney opted for

13:42.640 --> 13:47.600
trackless ride vehicles, which are a newer innovation among theme parks. Previously,

13:47.600 --> 13:52.400
similar attractions relied on tracked vehicles, but this restricted possibilities.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.640
Movement on tracks has to be more or less linear, and it's typically quite predictable as guests

13:56.640 --> 14:01.280
can see where the tracks go next. Trackless ride vehicles, meanwhile, can move in any

14:01.280 --> 14:06.560
horizontal direction, and circle back on their path as much as desired. In Rise of the Resistance,

14:06.560 --> 14:10.240
the vehicles wirelessly charge their batteries through pads on the floor as they wait for guests

14:10.240 --> 14:14.720
to load, then use a combination of RFID transponders in the floor, a local positioning

14:14.720 --> 14:18.640
system, and a Wi-Fi network to communicate and navigate through the attraction.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.720
After racing through the twists and turns of the Star Destroyer, the vehicle loads into an

14:22.720 --> 14:27.360
elevator to a second floor of the ride building. The plot continues as the guests encounter more

14:27.360 --> 14:31.280
and more animatronic and actor-portrayed characters attempting to thwart their escape,

14:31.280 --> 14:35.600
and the vehicle eventually enters what is presented as an escape pod. The ride vehicle

14:35.600 --> 14:39.840
is automatically locked into place using attachments in the floor, as what the escape pod

14:39.840 --> 14:46.320
actually is is another full-motion simulator. Except, this time, the simulator isn't mounted

14:46.320 --> 14:52.320
on a turntable—it's mounted inside a drop tower. Guests therefore experience the unmistakable

14:52.320 --> 14:57.120
sensation of freefall as the escape pod ejects from the ship, and rotate left-right back and

14:57.120 --> 15:01.920
forth as the pod flies through outer space. Finally, the ride vehicle exits the simulator,

15:01.920 --> 15:05.520
and navigates through the site of its crash landing to the attraction's exit.

15:06.480 --> 15:11.680
Now, the convolution of Rise of the Resistance makes it terrible for traditional marketing.

15:11.680 --> 15:17.360
One can't succinctly describe what it is, and even video doesn't do it justice. The multi-step,

15:17.360 --> 15:22.480
multi-system ride is designed all around the wow factor—making those leaving it feel like

15:22.480 --> 15:26.800
they've just experienced one of the best theme park attractions in the world. Why that works

15:26.800 --> 15:32.960
well nowadays, but less so in decades before, is because word of mouth is more powerful than ever.

15:32.960 --> 15:37.680
By providing guests a showy, best-in-the-world experience, people want to brag about it on

15:37.680 --> 15:41.920
social media. In the same way that people flaunt going to Coachella or the Super Bowl,

15:41.920 --> 15:46.720
people flaunt having experienced such a unique ride. But creating a once-in-a-lifetime ride

15:46.720 --> 15:51.200
is only half the battle. One of the biggest factors in a ride's value to a theme park

15:51.200 --> 15:56.960
is the degree of re-rideability. After riding once, how much do people want to do it again?

15:56.960 --> 16:01.120
Disney wants people to be able to enjoy repeat visits, as getting guests to come back

16:01.120 --> 16:05.760
is far cheaper than marketing to attract new guests. Rise of the Resistance incorporates

16:05.760 --> 16:10.000
many of the design elements that increase re-rideability, starting with just having a

16:10.000 --> 16:15.520
ton going on. Walt Disney described this as the cocktail party effect. Much like a good cocktail

16:15.520 --> 16:20.320
party, a good Disney ride should have so much going on that one can't possibly focus on it

16:20.320 --> 16:24.720
all at once. While you can't go to a given cocktail party again, you can pay a couple

16:24.720 --> 16:29.360
hundred dollars to come back to Disney next year to ride Rise of the Resistance again.

16:29.360 --> 16:33.600
Like other Disney rides, Rise of the Resistance also avoids using jokes in the plot,

16:33.600 --> 16:38.720
as humor is typically only entertaining once. Instead, it leans heavily on dramatic movements,

16:38.720 --> 16:42.240
like the drop tower freefall, that are fun to experience every time.

16:43.040 --> 16:47.840
In it some, Disney's Galaxy Edge represents the full might of Disney's business and

16:47.840 --> 16:52.480
Imagineering teams combined. With a billion dollars in construction costs at each of its

16:52.480 --> 16:56.880
locations, the company couldn't simply create something entertaining—that wasn't good enough

16:56.880 --> 17:01.600
to justify the investment. They needed something that capitalizes on the latest consumer demands,

17:01.600 --> 17:05.760
down to the deepest level. They needed something that would pull people away from the wizarding

17:05.760 --> 17:12.240
world of Harry Potter. People no longer want to just watch stories—they want to experience them.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.240
Consumers are willing to invest huge sums of money to create memories in a way that,

17:16.240 --> 17:22.240
for one reason or another, they would not decades ago. The future of entertainment is experiential,

17:22.240 --> 17:26.720
and so wherever entertainment companies can find a way of scaling perceived uniqueness,

17:26.720 --> 17:30.080
they're also bound to find huge sums of young money.

17:31.280 --> 17:35.280
The force behind Disney's acquisition of Star Wars and the development of Galaxy's Edge

17:35.280 --> 17:40.720
was the company's much-lauded, long-time CEO, Bob Iger. In his time, he grew the company's

17:40.720 --> 17:45.200
market capitalization five times over, and is regularly credited for much of the company's

17:45.200 --> 17:50.880
modern success. As Iger prepared to retire, he sat down and wrote a memoir, The Ride of a Lifetime,

17:50.880 --> 17:55.360
retelling his rise from a production assistant all the way to CEO of one of the world's largest

17:55.360 --> 18:00.240
companies. I listened to this memoir on Audible, and found it to be incredibly captivating,

18:00.240 --> 18:04.560
especially considering it includes some narration by the man himself. I'd encourage all of you to

18:04.560 --> 18:08.800
give it a listen, especially considering our deal with Audible allows you to listen for free.

18:08.800 --> 18:14.000
You see, Audible is the destination for audio entertainment—they have audiobooks, podcasts,

18:14.000 --> 18:18.800
guided wellness programs, comedy routines, and more. Personally, I love reading, but rarely

18:18.800 --> 18:23.440
find the time to actually sit down with a print book. Audible, meanwhile, can be injected into

18:23.440 --> 18:27.040
any moment your ears are free—it makes doing the dishes, commuting to work,

18:27.040 --> 18:32.080
going grocery shopping, and more far more fun and meaningful. A subscription gets you access

18:32.080 --> 18:35.920
to a huge catalog, but for anything that's not on there, you get a credit a month to

18:35.920 --> 18:40.560
