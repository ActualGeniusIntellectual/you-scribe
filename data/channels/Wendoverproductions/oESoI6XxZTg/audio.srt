1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,400
This is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. It's a dark ride that opened in 2010 at Universal

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,680
Studios' Islands of Adventure. It seats four to a bench, it lasts approximately four minutes,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,880
six seconds, and it changed theme parks forever. Functionally, the ride didn't reinvent the wheel.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,880
Rather than technological invention, it relied on innovative amalgamation. Unlike any before it,

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,160
the ride married tracks, robotic arms, wraparound screens, and film shots exclusively for the

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,320
attraction to create a deeply intimate, individualized tour through a universe

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,720
previously inaccessible outside of imagination. Guests loved it—they just couldn't explain it.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,320
From TV interviews to enthusiast blogs, the consensus was that you just have to experience

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,200
it yourself. This sentiment extended beyond the ride. From the Wizarding World's entrance,

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,840
where designers manipulated sightlines to foster a false sense of expanse, to the food, beverage,

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,320
and merchandise—be it a pint of butterbeer or a wool sweater straight out of the movies—the

12
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,240
20-acre plot didn't just look like Harry Potter, it felt like Harry Potter. For a few hours,

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,880
disbelief went suspended as visitors rode rides, snapped pictures with in-character actors,

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,480
and got sighs for wands, happily spending money all the while. The expansion became the park's

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,520
crown jewel. In the year following its opening, park attendance jumped a staggering 66%. Tourists

16
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,960
snatched up Harry Potter sweaters in the Florida heat, and stuffed $55 wands into carry-ons.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,640
Through bold innovation, Universal had effectively beat Disney at its own game. Visitors were now

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,920
planning trips around Universal Studios and, if they had the time, would check out Disney World 2.

19
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,880
The thing about Disney, though, is that when they lose, they don't stay down for long.

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,680
For Disney, the insane success of Universal's Harry Potter park was a massive what-if. More

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,160
accurately, in hindsight, it was a massive mistake, because the rights to a Harry Potter

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,440
theme park had nearly been theirs. J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. had signed a letter of intent

23
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,200
to build out a Harry Potter world with Disney in 2004. Then, according to insiders, Disney got cold

24
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,400
feet over concerns on Rowling's creative control and because the project seemed too expensive.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,960
A deeply immersive and experiential park design was just too much for Disney to stomach,

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,440
so Rowling went to Universal, who, for their part, harbored reservations as well.

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,960
What this 49-page document makes clear is that J.K. Rowling had little interest in settling for

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,160
the status quo. Rather, the licensing agreement between Universal and Warner Bros. ensured that

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
the park would mirror Rowling's vision and ambition. With everything from the property's

30
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,160
artwork, structures, and design, to the food, merchandise, and ads, the author had final

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
approval rights. Anything with visible third-party branding, on the other hand,

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,640
was subject to disapproval by the author, while third-party logos require the author's prior

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,440
written consent. And not only would the park be authentic, it would be standard-setting,

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,040
as the agreement stipulated that Universal would invest in maintaining a quote,

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,360
first-class, world-class-level themed area unsurpassed by any other.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,880
Developing unique, unbranded food, beverage, and merchandise, while partnered with manufacturers

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,160
and soda companies, proved tricky. Such novelty simply hadn't been employed before, and Universal

38
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,480
chafed under Rowling's requirements. Stacks of Harry Potter books were ever-present and

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,720
oft-referenced in creative meetings, while Alan Gilmore, an art director for the films,

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,880
went ahead and moved to the US to consult on the park's development. In the past,

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,440
directors like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron had come on at Universal and Disney to advise,

42
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,840
but this was different—their themed additions served Coke and Pepsi, not Butterbeer.

43
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,760
Rowling's centrality and authority was simply unprecedented, and for Universal it proved a

44
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,520
frustrating process. But as with the books, Rowling's vision was on point, and the park's

45
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,800
popped—not in spite of the constraints, but because of them.

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,240
Meanwhile, while Universal set attendance records, Disney reopened an upgraded attraction of their

47
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,520
own in 2011. Star Tours, a Star Wars ride that had been stuffing guests onto half-million-dollar

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,560
flight simulators and flying them through movie scenes since 1987, now boasted an expanded list

49
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,840
of plotlines to celebrate the conclusion of the prequel trilogy. The revamped ride hardly made

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,480
waves, but it gave Disney CEO Bob Iger a chance to speak with George Lucas. Months later, Disney

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,880
announced the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm. Among other things, the massive move signaled

52
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,520
that Disney was positioning itself to take on Universal's game-changing theme land.

53
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,400
As Iger explained to stockholders, quote, our Lucasfilm valuation is almost entirely driven

54
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,120
by the Star Wars franchise, and that he expected to quote, utilize Star Wars in other businesses,

55
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,080
including parks and resorts, in games, and in our television business. What Disney had learned with

56
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,800
the lukewarm launch of Cars Land in 2012 was that if they were to make a Wizarding World-sized

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,000
splash, they needed a fictional world that people wanted to get lost in. With Star Wars,

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,600
they finally had it. After some decade of planning, years of construction, and a billion

59
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,280
dollars in bills, the Star Wars universe's newest expansion was finally ready to open for business.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,200
Fans flew in from far, far away to amass at Disney's gates in the early hours of May 31st,

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,720
2019. Come 8am, the most committed early risers were escorted through the park to the entrance

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,320
of Black Spire Outpost. What they found on the other side was one of the most complex,

63
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,560
most expensive, and most ambitious theme park expansions ever.

64
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,520
Star Wars Galaxy Edge is unlike anything ever built before, with one notable exception. Taking

65
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,440
a page out of Universal's playbook and building on the success of the Wizarding World of Harry

66
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Potter, this wasn't a land inspired by jungles or fairy tales or Jules Verne's vision of the future.

67
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,280
This was the physical embodiment of Star Wars. Seeing the success of bringing Hogsmeade and

68
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,640
Diagon Alley into the real world, this was a trading outpost on the frontier planet Batuu,

69
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,520
a fully-fledged element of Star Wars canon, brought into reality thanks to the deepest

70
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,360
level of theming ever seen at a Disney park. Each of the 1,600 employees, or cast members

71
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,520
working within the land, from the actors in stormtrooper costumes to the cashiers at the

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,720
merchandise shops, has a unique backstory that, thanks to improvisation classes included in their

73
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,560
training, reflects in how they interact with guests. They use unique themed terminology—cell

74
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
phones are data pads, water fountains are hydrators, bathrooms are refreshers,

75
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
and bright suns means good morning. The food—smoked kadu ribs, blue milk,

76
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,680
mustafarian lava rolls, and plenty more—all reflect what Star Wars characters might eat

77
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,480
during the refueling stop on Batuu. Drinks are sold in special, themed containers,

78
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,360
with Coke, Sprite, and Dasani written in the fictional Oribesh alphabet from Star Wars.

79
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,840
Functional areas like bathrooms are fully themed too, with a design that looks nothing like the

80
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,160
Earthly equivalents. Even the receipts from the various shops reflect the fact that they're from

81
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,440
Blackspire Outpost, rather than Disney World or Land. Disney kept the outside world out to a

82
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,480
greater extent than any of its lands had ever before, mirrored only by Universal's Wizarding

83
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,640
World of Harry Potter. While Universal's case might have been spurred forward by the author's

84
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,600
deep creative control, both parks ingeniously shifted their strategies to capitalize on one

85
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,280
of the most dramatic shifts in the way consumers consume ever.

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,160
In short, young people aren't buying things, they're buying experiences. Year-over-year

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,200
spending growth on spectator sports, amusement parks, live entertainment, and travel has far

88
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,960
outpaced overall spending growth. While the average baby boomer devotes $134 to experiences

89
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,520
in a given month, millennials, a far less wealthy cohort, spend $164. While the reasons behind the

90
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,160
shifts go far beyond a single factor, no small part can be attributed to the rise of social

91
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,800
media. Younger people want to live a life that portrays well online, and that mimics the purportedly

92
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,000
idyllic lives portrayed by others on social media. Disney was a foundational element of the

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,960
experience economy before this term was even defined, but not in a way that fit the 21st

94
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,320
century conception of it. Airbnb, for example, grew off of individuals' desire to stay somewhere

95
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,120
unique rather than a cookie cutter hotel room. Supreme became a hot commodity by making the

96
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,760
buying experience one where a select number of people felt privileged for having completed it.

97
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,480
Experiences have to be unique to be considered true experiences, and being one of tens of

98
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,000
thousands to pass through Space Mountain on a given day isn't unique. Therefore, every element

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,360
of Galaxy's Edge, from big to small, was designed around providing each guest a unique experience.

100
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,440
To start, the winding streets restrict eyelines so that one can only see so far ahead. That nudges

101
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,800
guests to explore, and once they reach the core of the land they find a complex maze of streets.

102
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Theme parks are specifically designed so that guests get just a little bit lost. This helps

103
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,080
promote a sense of exploration as they move around, and obfuscating people's mental maps

104
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,200
typically defaults them to perceiving a place as larger than it actually is. Another concept that

105
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,640
differs in Galaxy's Edge relative to other lands is that of the payoff. Payoff is what designers

106
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,480
use to refer to anything cool, fun, or unique that a guest will enjoy finding. In more traditional

107
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,680
theme park design, the payoffs are big, but don't always live up to their promise. In its early

108
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,080
years, Sleeping Beauty's Castle was a major payoff for entering the park, but guests were often

109
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,160
disappointed to learn that they couldn't enter the structure. Disney eventually fixes this by

110
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,320
adding an interior, but is perpetually weighed towards overselling and underdelivering with its

111
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:31,040
major exterior elements… until Galaxy's Edge. The entrances of the land do very little to sell it.

112
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,760
While most lands typically open to a big, expansive, impressive view, Galaxy's Edge's

113
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,120
entrances push in towards fairly tight, unimpressive areas. Then, smaller payoffs like

114
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
ships, droids, and characters are scattered throughout, rewarding exploration, and finally,

115
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,160
the biggest payoff, the Millennium Falcon, is only found after a guest adequately navigates

116
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,840
the streets of Black Spire Outpost. In the process of exploration, guests find the design elements

117
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,280
that further promote individualized experiences. The typical problem with individualized offerings

118
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,000
is that they're almost impossible to scale, and theme parks' profitability is all based on

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,200
offering entertainment at scale. Galaxy's Edge fixes this paradox by directly monetizing the

120
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,840
individual, unscalable experiences. With the land themed as a trading outpost,

121
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,560
Disney is able to incorporate retail without straying from the plot. Guests wait through

122
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,640
long lines for the privilege of spending $219.99 to enter a workshop where cast members guide

123
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,600
customers through a highly-themed experience of assembling a custom lightsaber. Similar lines

124
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,240
regularly stretch outside of a shop where galactic consumers can assemble their own droid, or outside

125
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,640
the entrance of the purportedly notorious Ogas Cantina, where visitors can enjoy some of the

126
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,240
universe's famed drinks. Guests can even exchange their dollars for the local Batuian Spira, which

127
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,200
is legal tender throughout the land. Through this, the park encourages all to spend more,

128
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
and is also able to effectively sell worthless pieces of metal, considering many will take some

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,200
Spira home. Essentially, Disney has created a land where to live like a Star Wars character,

130
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,720
to get the individualized experience everyone wants, guests have to shop like a Star Wars

131
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,520
character. But of course, for Galaxy's Edge to exist as a theme park land,

132
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,400
it must have some theme park rides. But continuing to capitalize on the changing

133
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,920
business environment, Disney was able to build an attraction unlike anything ever attempted before.

134
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,880
It's called Star Wars Rise of the Resistance, and uniquely, it's not one that can be succinctly

135
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,240
summarized by describing it as a rollercoaster or a simulator or a drop tower. The need for

136
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,360
highly marketable attractions has long worked in opposition to designers' desire to create the best

137
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,920
experiences. That's in large part because marketing teams continuously push designers

138
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,640
to create world firsts, but doing something new only rarely translates into doing something

139
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,840
better. For example, England's Alton Towers theme park has long featured the Galactica coaster,

140
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,520
which is regularly ranked as one of the world's 50 best. In 2016, after the park's winter closure,

141
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,640
the ride reopened refurbished as the world's first virtual reality rollercoaster. Guests would

142
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,720
don headsets to simulate a ride through space, which earned the park coverage by Engadget,

143
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,920
CNET, Wire, the LA Times, and more media outlets. Ultimately, though, guests hated it. The need to

144
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,160
fit everyone with headsets increased wait times dramatically, and people didn't feel like the VR

145
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,520
experience made that wait worthwhile. Therefore, after three seasons, the headsets were removed,

146
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:29,120
and Galactica was reverted into a regular coaster. Disney, meanwhile, has recognized that rides no

147
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,840
longer must be marketed through traditional means using a phrase as simple as the world's first VR

148
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:39,680
rollercoaster, and so the Imagineers behind Rise of the Resistance embraced the value of complexity.

149
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,480
The ride starts with guests entering a briefing room, where a hologram sets up what's to come.

150
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,000
Riders are told that they're new recruits fighting for the Resistance, and are soon

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
ushered onto a transport ship bound for the planet Pekara. These ships are essentially

152
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,240
simulator pods that provide light motion that matches what's seen through the windows.

153
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,280
However, the plot progresses with the ship being captured by an enemy First Order star destroyer,

154
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,840
meaning guests must exit into an area different from where they entered. To achieve this,

155
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,960
there are actually three simulator pods positioned on a giant turntable. Once the doors are closed,

156
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,760
the turntable spins about a third, timed up with the movement of the ship rotating upon takeoff.

157
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,600
Then, it makes its second movement as the ship is getting pulled in by a tractor beam,

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,040
so guests don't feel like the motion is out of place, and exit from the door through which

159
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,640
they entered into an entirely new space—a massive, cavernous room filled with dozens

160
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,200
of stormtroopers. Next, cast members quickly order guests into an interrogation room,

161
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,360
where a door is eventually cut into the side by Resistance fighters, and the captive recruits

162
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,640
are quickly shepherded onto two ride vehicles. Now, for this attraction, Disney opted for

163
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,600
trackless ride vehicles, which are a newer innovation among theme parks. Previously,

164
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,400
similar attractions relied on tracked vehicles, but this restricted possibilities.

165
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,640
Movement on tracks has to be more or less linear, and it's typically quite predictable as guests

166
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,280
can see where the tracks go next. Trackless ride vehicles, meanwhile, can move in any

167
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,560
horizontal direction, and circle back on their path as much as desired. In Rise of the Resistance,

168
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,240
the vehicles wirelessly charge their batteries through pads on the floor as they wait for guests

169
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
to load, then use a combination of RFID transponders in the floor, a local positioning

170
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,640
system, and a Wi-Fi network to communicate and navigate through the attraction.

171
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,720
After racing through the twists and turns of the Star Destroyer, the vehicle loads into an

172
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,360
elevator to a second floor of the ride building. The plot continues as the guests encounter more

173
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,280
and more animatronic and actor-portrayed characters attempting to thwart their escape,

174
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,600
and the vehicle eventually enters what is presented as an escape pod. The ride vehicle

175
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,840
is automatically locked into place using attachments in the floor, as what the escape pod

176
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,320
actually is is another full-motion simulator. Except, this time, the simulator isn't mounted

177
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,320
on a turntable—it's mounted inside a drop tower. Guests therefore experience the unmistakable

178
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,120
sensation of freefall as the escape pod ejects from the ship, and rotate left-right back and

179
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,920
forth as the pod flies through outer space. Finally, the ride vehicle exits the simulator,

180
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,520
and navigates through the site of its crash landing to the attraction's exit.

181
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,680
Now, the convolution of Rise of the Resistance makes it terrible for traditional marketing.

182
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,360
One can't succinctly describe what it is, and even video doesn't do it justice. The multi-step,

183
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,480
multi-system ride is designed all around the wow factor—making those leaving it feel like

184
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
they've just experienced one of the best theme park attractions in the world. Why that works

185
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,960
well nowadays, but less so in decades before, is because word of mouth is more powerful than ever.

186
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,680
By providing guests a showy, best-in-the-world experience, people want to brag about it on

187
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,920
social media. In the same way that people flaunt going to Coachella or the Super Bowl,

188
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,720
people flaunt having experienced such a unique ride. But creating a once-in-a-lifetime ride

189
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,200
is only half the battle. One of the biggest factors in a ride's value to a theme park

190
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,960
is the degree of re-rideability. After riding once, how much do people want to do it again?

191
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,120
Disney wants people to be able to enjoy repeat visits, as getting guests to come back

192
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,760
is far cheaper than marketing to attract new guests. Rise of the Resistance incorporates

193
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,000
many of the design elements that increase re-rideability, starting with just having a

194
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,520
ton going on. Walt Disney described this as the cocktail party effect. Much like a good cocktail

195
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,320
party, a good Disney ride should have so much going on that one can't possibly focus on it

196
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,720
all at once. While you can't go to a given cocktail party again, you can pay a couple

197
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
hundred dollars to come back to Disney next year to ride Rise of the Resistance again.

198
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
Like other Disney rides, Rise of the Resistance also avoids using jokes in the plot,

199
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,720
as humor is typically only entertaining once. Instead, it leans heavily on dramatic movements,

200
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
like the drop tower freefall, that are fun to experience every time.

201
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,840
In it some, Disney's Galaxy Edge represents the full might of Disney's business and

202
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,480
Imagineering teams combined. With a billion dollars in construction costs at each of its

203
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,880
locations, the company couldn't simply create something entertaining—that wasn't good enough

204
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,600
to justify the investment. They needed something that capitalizes on the latest consumer demands,

205
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,760
down to the deepest level. They needed something that would pull people away from the wizarding

206
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,240
world of Harry Potter. People no longer want to just watch stories—they want to experience them.

207
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,240
Consumers are willing to invest huge sums of money to create memories in a way that,

208
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,240
for one reason or another, they would not decades ago. The future of entertainment is experiential,

209
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,720
and so wherever entertainment companies can find a way of scaling perceived uniqueness,

210
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,080
they're also bound to find huge sums of young money.

211
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,280
The force behind Disney's acquisition of Star Wars and the development of Galaxy's Edge

212
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,720
was the company's much-lauded, long-time CEO, Bob Iger. In his time, he grew the company's

213
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,200
market capitalization five times over, and is regularly credited for much of the company's

214
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,880
modern success. As Iger prepared to retire, he sat down and wrote a memoir, The Ride of a Lifetime,

215
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,360
retelling his rise from a production assistant all the way to CEO of one of the world's largest

216
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,240
companies. I listened to this memoir on Audible, and found it to be incredibly captivating,

217
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,560
especially considering it includes some narration by the man himself. I'd encourage all of you to

218
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,800
give it a listen, especially considering our deal with Audible allows you to listen for free.

219
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,000
You see, Audible is the destination for audio entertainment—they have audiobooks, podcasts,

220
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,800
guided wellness programs, comedy routines, and more. Personally, I love reading, but rarely

221
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,440
find the time to actually sit down with a print book. Audible, meanwhile, can be injected into

222
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,040
any moment your ears are free—it makes doing the dishes, commuting to work,

223
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,080
going grocery shopping, and more far more fun and meaningful. A subscription gets you access

224
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,920
to a huge catalog, but for anything that's not on there, you get a credit a month to

225
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,560
