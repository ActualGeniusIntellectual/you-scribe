560	6400	This is Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. It's a dark ride that opened in 2010 at Universal
6400	11680	Studios' Islands of Adventure. It seats four to a bench, it lasts approximately four minutes,
11680	18880	six seconds, and it changed theme parks forever. Functionally, the ride didn't reinvent the wheel.
18880	24880	Rather than technological invention, it relied on innovative amalgamation. Unlike any before it,
24880	30160	the ride married tracks, robotic arms, wraparound screens, and film shots exclusively for the
30160	34320	attraction to create a deeply intimate, individualized tour through a universe
34320	40720	previously inaccessible outside of imagination. Guests loved it—they just couldn't explain it.
41360	46320	From TV interviews to enthusiast blogs, the consensus was that you just have to experience
46320	51200	it yourself. This sentiment extended beyond the ride. From the Wizarding World's entrance,
51200	55840	where designers manipulated sightlines to foster a false sense of expanse, to the food, beverage,
55840	60320	and merchandise—be it a pint of butterbeer or a wool sweater straight out of the movies—the
60320	66240	20-acre plot didn't just look like Harry Potter, it felt like Harry Potter. For a few hours,
66240	70880	disbelief went suspended as visitors rode rides, snapped pictures with in-character actors,
70880	76480	and got sighs for wands, happily spending money all the while. The expansion became the park's
76480	83520	crown jewel. In the year following its opening, park attendance jumped a staggering 66%. Tourists
83520	88960	snatched up Harry Potter sweaters in the Florida heat, and stuffed $55 wands into carry-ons.
88960	94640	Through bold innovation, Universal had effectively beat Disney at its own game. Visitors were now
94640	99920	planning trips around Universal Studios and, if they had the time, would check out Disney World 2.
99920	104880	The thing about Disney, though, is that when they lose, they don't stay down for long.
105760	111680	For Disney, the insane success of Universal's Harry Potter park was a massive what-if. More
111680	116160	accurately, in hindsight, it was a massive mistake, because the rights to a Harry Potter
116160	121440	theme park had nearly been theirs. J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. had signed a letter of intent
121440	127200	to build out a Harry Potter world with Disney in 2004. Then, according to insiders, Disney got cold
127200	132400	feet over concerns on Rowling's creative control and because the project seemed too expensive.
132400	136960	A deeply immersive and experiential park design was just too much for Disney to stomach,
136960	141440	so Rowling went to Universal, who, for their part, harbored reservations as well.
142000	146960	What this 49-page document makes clear is that J.K. Rowling had little interest in settling for
146960	152160	the status quo. Rather, the licensing agreement between Universal and Warner Bros. ensured that
152160	156640	the park would mirror Rowling's vision and ambition. With everything from the property's
156640	162160	artwork, structures, and design, to the food, merchandise, and ads, the author had final
162160	166000	approval rights. Anything with visible third-party branding, on the other hand,
166000	170640	was subject to disapproval by the author, while third-party logos require the author's prior
170640	175440	written consent. And not only would the park be authentic, it would be standard-setting,
175440	179040	as the agreement stipulated that Universal would invest in maintaining a quote,
179040	183360	first-class, world-class-level themed area unsurpassed by any other.
184000	188880	Developing unique, unbranded food, beverage, and merchandise, while partnered with manufacturers
188880	194160	and soda companies, proved tricky. Such novelty simply hadn't been employed before, and Universal
194160	198480	chafed under Rowling's requirements. Stacks of Harry Potter books were ever-present and
198480	202720	oft-referenced in creative meetings, while Alan Gilmore, an art director for the films,
202720	206880	went ahead and moved to the US to consult on the park's development. In the past,
206880	211440	directors like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron had come on at Universal and Disney to advise,
211520	215840	but this was different—their themed additions served Coke and Pepsi, not Butterbeer.
216400	221760	Rowling's centrality and authority was simply unprecedented, and for Universal it proved a
221760	227520	frustrating process. But as with the books, Rowling's vision was on point, and the park's
227520	230800	popped—not in spite of the constraints, but because of them.
231360	236240	Meanwhile, while Universal set attendance records, Disney reopened an upgraded attraction of their
236240	241520	own in 2011. Star Tours, a Star Wars ride that had been stuffing guests onto half-million-dollar
241520	246560	flight simulators and flying them through movie scenes since 1987, now boasted an expanded list
246560	251840	of plotlines to celebrate the conclusion of the prequel trilogy. The revamped ride hardly made
251840	258480	waves, but it gave Disney CEO Bob Iger a chance to speak with George Lucas. Months later, Disney
258480	264880	announced the $4 billion purchase of Lucasfilm. Among other things, the massive move signaled
264880	269520	that Disney was positioning itself to take on Universal's game-changing theme land.
269520	274400	As Iger explained to stockholders, quote, our Lucasfilm valuation is almost entirely driven
274400	279120	by the Star Wars franchise, and that he expected to quote, utilize Star Wars in other businesses,
279120	284080	including parks and resorts, in games, and in our television business. What Disney had learned with
284080	288800	the lukewarm launch of Cars Land in 2012 was that if they were to make a Wizarding World-sized
288800	294000	splash, they needed a fictional world that people wanted to get lost in. With Star Wars,
294000	299600	they finally had it. After some decade of planning, years of construction, and a billion
299600	305280	dollars in bills, the Star Wars universe's newest expansion was finally ready to open for business.
305840	311200	Fans flew in from far, far away to amass at Disney's gates in the early hours of May 31st,
311200	316720	2019. Come 8am, the most committed early risers were escorted through the park to the entrance
316720	322320	of Black Spire Outpost. What they found on the other side was one of the most complex,
322320	326560	most expensive, and most ambitious theme park expansions ever.
327280	333520	Star Wars Galaxy Edge is unlike anything ever built before, with one notable exception. Taking
333520	337440	a page out of Universal's playbook and building on the success of the Wizarding World of Harry
337440	343440	Potter, this wasn't a land inspired by jungles or fairy tales or Jules Verne's vision of the future.
343440	349280	This was the physical embodiment of Star Wars. Seeing the success of bringing Hogsmeade and
349280	354640	Diagon Alley into the real world, this was a trading outpost on the frontier planet Batuu,
354640	359520	a fully-fledged element of Star Wars canon, brought into reality thanks to the deepest
359520	365360	level of theming ever seen at a Disney park. Each of the 1,600 employees, or cast members
365360	369520	working within the land, from the actors in stormtrooper costumes to the cashiers at the
369520	374720	merchandise shops, has a unique backstory that, thanks to improvisation classes included in their
374720	380560	training, reflects in how they interact with guests. They use unique themed terminology—cell
380560	384240	phones are data pads, water fountains are hydrators, bathrooms are refreshers,
384240	388800	and bright suns means good morning. The food—smoked kadu ribs, blue milk,
388800	393680	mustafarian lava rolls, and plenty more—all reflect what Star Wars characters might eat
393680	398480	during the refueling stop on Batuu. Drinks are sold in special, themed containers,
398480	403360	with Coke, Sprite, and Dasani written in the fictional Oribesh alphabet from Star Wars.
403360	407840	Functional areas like bathrooms are fully themed too, with a design that looks nothing like the
407840	412160	Earthly equivalents. Even the receipts from the various shops reflect the fact that they're from
412160	417440	Blackspire Outpost, rather than Disney World or Land. Disney kept the outside world out to a
417440	422480	greater extent than any of its lands had ever before, mirrored only by Universal's Wizarding
422480	426640	World of Harry Potter. While Universal's case might have been spurred forward by the author's
426640	431600	deep creative control, both parks ingeniously shifted their strategies to capitalize on one
431600	435280	of the most dramatic shifts in the way consumers consume ever.
436160	442160	In short, young people aren't buying things, they're buying experiences. Year-over-year
442160	447200	spending growth on spectator sports, amusement parks, live entertainment, and travel has far
447200	452960	outpaced overall spending growth. While the average baby boomer devotes $134 to experiences
452960	459520	in a given month, millennials, a far less wealthy cohort, spend $164. While the reasons behind the
459520	464160	shifts go far beyond a single factor, no small part can be attributed to the rise of social
464160	468800	media. Younger people want to live a life that portrays well online, and that mimics the purportedly
468800	474000	idyllic lives portrayed by others on social media. Disney was a foundational element of the
474000	478960	experience economy before this term was even defined, but not in a way that fit the 21st
478960	484320	century conception of it. Airbnb, for example, grew off of individuals' desire to stay somewhere
484320	489120	unique rather than a cookie cutter hotel room. Supreme became a hot commodity by making the
489120	493760	buying experience one where a select number of people felt privileged for having completed it.
493760	498480	Experiences have to be unique to be considered true experiences, and being one of tens of
498480	504000	thousands to pass through Space Mountain on a given day isn't unique. Therefore, every element
504000	509360	of Galaxy's Edge, from big to small, was designed around providing each guest a unique experience.
509920	515440	To start, the winding streets restrict eyelines so that one can only see so far ahead. That nudges
515440	520800	guests to explore, and once they reach the core of the land they find a complex maze of streets.
520800	526000	Theme parks are specifically designed so that guests get just a little bit lost. This helps
526000	530080	promote a sense of exploration as they move around, and obfuscating people's mental maps
530080	535200	typically defaults them to perceiving a place as larger than it actually is. Another concept that
535200	540640	differs in Galaxy's Edge relative to other lands is that of the payoff. Payoff is what designers
540640	546480	use to refer to anything cool, fun, or unique that a guest will enjoy finding. In more traditional
546480	551680	theme park design, the payoffs are big, but don't always live up to their promise. In its early
551680	556080	years, Sleeping Beauty's Castle was a major payoff for entering the park, but guests were often
556080	560160	disappointed to learn that they couldn't enter the structure. Disney eventually fixes this by
560160	564320	adding an interior, but is perpetually weighed towards overselling and underdelivering with its
564320	571040	major exterior elements… until Galaxy's Edge. The entrances of the land do very little to sell it.
571040	575760	While most lands typically open to a big, expansive, impressive view, Galaxy's Edge's
575760	581120	entrances push in towards fairly tight, unimpressive areas. Then, smaller payoffs like
581120	585440	ships, droids, and characters are scattered throughout, rewarding exploration, and finally,
585440	590160	the biggest payoff, the Millennium Falcon, is only found after a guest adequately navigates
590160	595840	the streets of Black Spire Outpost. In the process of exploration, guests find the design elements
595840	601280	that further promote individualized experiences. The typical problem with individualized offerings
601280	606000	is that they're almost impossible to scale, and theme parks' profitability is all based on
606000	611200	offering entertainment at scale. Galaxy's Edge fixes this paradox by directly monetizing the
611200	615840	individual, unscalable experiences. With the land themed as a trading outpost,
615840	620560	Disney is able to incorporate retail without straying from the plot. Guests wait through
620560	626640	long lines for the privilege of spending $219.99 to enter a workshop where cast members guide
626640	631600	customers through a highly-themed experience of assembling a custom lightsaber. Similar lines
631600	636240	regularly stretch outside of a shop where galactic consumers can assemble their own droid, or outside
636240	640640	the entrance of the purportedly notorious Ogas Cantina, where visitors can enjoy some of the
640640	646240	universe's famed drinks. Guests can even exchange their dollars for the local Batuian Spira, which
646240	651200	is legal tender throughout the land. Through this, the park encourages all to spend more,
651200	655600	and is also able to effectively sell worthless pieces of metal, considering many will take some
655600	661200	Spira home. Essentially, Disney has created a land where to live like a Star Wars character,
661200	666720	to get the individualized experience everyone wants, guests have to shop like a Star Wars
666720	671520	character. But of course, for Galaxy's Edge to exist as a theme park land,
671520	676400	it must have some theme park rides. But continuing to capitalize on the changing
676400	681920	business environment, Disney was able to build an attraction unlike anything ever attempted before.
681920	686880	It's called Star Wars Rise of the Resistance, and uniquely, it's not one that can be succinctly
686880	692240	summarized by describing it as a rollercoaster or a simulator or a drop tower. The need for
692240	697360	highly marketable attractions has long worked in opposition to designers' desire to create the best
697360	701920	experiences. That's in large part because marketing teams continuously push designers
701920	706640	to create world firsts, but doing something new only rarely translates into doing something
706640	711840	better. For example, England's Alton Towers theme park has long featured the Galactica coaster,
711840	717520	which is regularly ranked as one of the world's 50 best. In 2016, after the park's winter closure,
717520	722640	the ride reopened refurbished as the world's first virtual reality rollercoaster. Guests would
722640	726720	don headsets to simulate a ride through space, which earned the park coverage by Engadget,
726720	733920	CNET, Wire, the LA Times, and more media outlets. Ultimately, though, guests hated it. The need to
733920	738160	fit everyone with headsets increased wait times dramatically, and people didn't feel like the VR
738160	743520	experience made that wait worthwhile. Therefore, after three seasons, the headsets were removed,
743520	749120	and Galactica was reverted into a regular coaster. Disney, meanwhile, has recognized that rides no
749120	753840	longer must be marketed through traditional means using a phrase as simple as the world's first VR
753840	759680	rollercoaster, and so the Imagineers behind Rise of the Resistance embraced the value of complexity.
759680	764480	The ride starts with guests entering a briefing room, where a hologram sets up what's to come.
764480	768000	Riders are told that they're new recruits fighting for the Resistance, and are soon
768000	772480	ushered onto a transport ship bound for the planet Pekara. These ships are essentially
772480	776240	simulator pods that provide light motion that matches what's seen through the windows.
776240	781280	However, the plot progresses with the ship being captured by an enemy First Order star destroyer,
781280	785840	meaning guests must exit into an area different from where they entered. To achieve this,
785840	790960	there are actually three simulator pods positioned on a giant turntable. Once the doors are closed,
790960	795760	the turntable spins about a third, timed up with the movement of the ship rotating upon takeoff.
795760	799600	Then, it makes its second movement as the ship is getting pulled in by a tractor beam,
799600	803040	so guests don't feel like the motion is out of place, and exit from the door through which
803040	808640	they entered into an entirely new space—a massive, cavernous room filled with dozens
808640	813200	of stormtroopers. Next, cast members quickly order guests into an interrogation room,
813200	817360	where a door is eventually cut into the side by Resistance fighters, and the captive recruits
817360	822640	are quickly shepherded onto two ride vehicles. Now, for this attraction, Disney opted for
822640	827600	trackless ride vehicles, which are a newer innovation among theme parks. Previously,
827600	832400	similar attractions relied on tracked vehicles, but this restricted possibilities.
832400	836640	Movement on tracks has to be more or less linear, and it's typically quite predictable as guests
836640	841280	can see where the tracks go next. Trackless ride vehicles, meanwhile, can move in any
841280	846560	horizontal direction, and circle back on their path as much as desired. In Rise of the Resistance,
846560	850240	the vehicles wirelessly charge their batteries through pads on the floor as they wait for guests
850240	854720	to load, then use a combination of RFID transponders in the floor, a local positioning
854720	858640	system, and a Wi-Fi network to communicate and navigate through the attraction.
858640	862720	After racing through the twists and turns of the Star Destroyer, the vehicle loads into an
862720	867360	elevator to a second floor of the ride building. The plot continues as the guests encounter more
867360	871280	and more animatronic and actor-portrayed characters attempting to thwart their escape,
871280	875600	and the vehicle eventually enters what is presented as an escape pod. The ride vehicle
875600	879840	is automatically locked into place using attachments in the floor, as what the escape pod
879840	886320	actually is is another full-motion simulator. Except, this time, the simulator isn't mounted
886320	892320	on a turntable—it's mounted inside a drop tower. Guests therefore experience the unmistakable
892320	897120	sensation of freefall as the escape pod ejects from the ship, and rotate left-right back and
897120	901920	forth as the pod flies through outer space. Finally, the ride vehicle exits the simulator,
901920	905520	and navigates through the site of its crash landing to the attraction's exit.
906480	911680	Now, the convolution of Rise of the Resistance makes it terrible for traditional marketing.
911680	917360	One can't succinctly describe what it is, and even video doesn't do it justice. The multi-step,
917360	922480	multi-system ride is designed all around the wow factor—making those leaving it feel like
922480	926800	they've just experienced one of the best theme park attractions in the world. Why that works
926800	932960	well nowadays, but less so in decades before, is because word of mouth is more powerful than ever.
932960	937680	By providing guests a showy, best-in-the-world experience, people want to brag about it on
937680	941920	social media. In the same way that people flaunt going to Coachella or the Super Bowl,
941920	946720	people flaunt having experienced such a unique ride. But creating a once-in-a-lifetime ride
946720	951200	is only half the battle. One of the biggest factors in a ride's value to a theme park
951200	956960	is the degree of re-rideability. After riding once, how much do people want to do it again?
956960	961120	Disney wants people to be able to enjoy repeat visits, as getting guests to come back
961120	965760	is far cheaper than marketing to attract new guests. Rise of the Resistance incorporates
965760	970000	many of the design elements that increase re-rideability, starting with just having a
970000	975520	ton going on. Walt Disney described this as the cocktail party effect. Much like a good cocktail
975520	980320	party, a good Disney ride should have so much going on that one can't possibly focus on it
980320	984720	all at once. While you can't go to a given cocktail party again, you can pay a couple
984720	989360	hundred dollars to come back to Disney next year to ride Rise of the Resistance again.
989360	993600	Like other Disney rides, Rise of the Resistance also avoids using jokes in the plot,
993600	998720	as humor is typically only entertaining once. Instead, it leans heavily on dramatic movements,
998720	1002240	like the drop tower freefall, that are fun to experience every time.
1003040	1007840	In it some, Disney's Galaxy Edge represents the full might of Disney's business and
1007840	1012480	Imagineering teams combined. With a billion dollars in construction costs at each of its
1012480	1016880	locations, the company couldn't simply create something entertaining—that wasn't good enough
1016880	1021600	to justify the investment. They needed something that capitalizes on the latest consumer demands,
1021600	1025760	down to the deepest level. They needed something that would pull people away from the wizarding
1025760	1032240	world of Harry Potter. People no longer want to just watch stories—they want to experience them.
1032240	1036240	Consumers are willing to invest huge sums of money to create memories in a way that,
1036240	1042240	for one reason or another, they would not decades ago. The future of entertainment is experiential,
1042240	1046720	and so wherever entertainment companies can find a way of scaling perceived uniqueness,
1046720	1050080	they're also bound to find huge sums of young money.
1051280	1055280	The force behind Disney's acquisition of Star Wars and the development of Galaxy's Edge
1055280	1060720	was the company's much-lauded, long-time CEO, Bob Iger. In his time, he grew the company's
1060720	1065200	market capitalization five times over, and is regularly credited for much of the company's
1065200	1070880	modern success. As Iger prepared to retire, he sat down and wrote a memoir, The Ride of a Lifetime,
1070880	1075360	retelling his rise from a production assistant all the way to CEO of one of the world's largest
1075360	1080240	companies. I listened to this memoir on Audible, and found it to be incredibly captivating,
1080240	1084560	especially considering it includes some narration by the man himself. I'd encourage all of you to
1084560	1088800	give it a listen, especially considering our deal with Audible allows you to listen for free.
1088800	1094000	You see, Audible is the destination for audio entertainment—they have audiobooks, podcasts,
1094000	1098800	guided wellness programs, comedy routines, and more. Personally, I love reading, but rarely
1098800	1103440	find the time to actually sit down with a print book. Audible, meanwhile, can be injected into
1103440	1107040	any moment your ears are free—it makes doing the dishes, commuting to work,
1107040	1112080	going grocery shopping, and more far more fun and meaningful. A subscription gets you access
1112080	1115920	to a huge catalog, but for anything that's not on there, you get a credit a month to
1115920	1120560	download any other audiobook for free. But, by using our link—available by clicking the button
