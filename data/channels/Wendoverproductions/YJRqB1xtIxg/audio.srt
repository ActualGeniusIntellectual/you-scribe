3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,600
Moving the president of the United States from one location to another is a logistical

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,540
nightmare that happens every single day.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,380
The American president is one of the most powerful persons in the world and there is

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,860
no time when the president is more exposed than when they're in transport.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:28,660
Two of the four successful assassinations of American presidents were when they were

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,880
travelingâ€”Garfield and Kennedy.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,300
For that reason, the secret service devotes an enormous amount of resources to ensuring

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:39,020
the president gets from one place to another safely.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,420
The presidential motorcade is perhaps the most impressive method of transportation.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,060
It includes up to 40 or 50 vehicles and over 100 people.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,980
Let's take a look at some footage of a motorcade.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,760
This is the lead car, or in this case motorcycle.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,900
As the name suggests, its job is to lead the motorcade, but it's not actually the first

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,900
vehicle.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,540
What we don't see here is the route car which would have come through about 5 minutes

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,180
before the lead car.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,020
The route car is always followed by about 20 or 30 motorcycles which play the essential

20
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,020
role of clearing the route of cars.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,100
When driving on a highway, they'll speed ahead and close exits so that no cars can

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,260
come on the highway, although they have to use a different technique in cities.

23
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,820
When driving in DC, where other drivers are used to frequent motorcades, the motorcycles

24
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,140
often drive in a v-pattern pushing cars to the side to clear the way for the motorcade.

25
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,700
This leads to a disruption of only about 2 or 3 minutes.

26
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,820
Outside of DC, drivers are less used to motorcades so the motorcycles will typically completely

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,740
block off the intersecting streets to create one continuous clear path for the president.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,780
The entire first section of the motorcade isn't actually run by the secret service.

29
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,860
It's run by the local police jurisdiction of wherever the president is.

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,100
The fewer secret service cars and individuals needed for motorcades, the better since both

31
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,720
the cars and agents need to travel to wherever the president is visiting in advance which

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,420
is, of course, incredibly expensive.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,620
The next part of the motorcade is what's known as the secure package.

34
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,540
It's the essential core to the motorcade because it's the group of cars that directly

35
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,020
secures the president.

36
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,940
In case of attack, this group of cars can detach from the rest of the motorcade and

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,900
function as an independent unit.

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,880
The most important car in the secure package is the president's limo but one can never

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,660
be sure which one that is because there are always two limos.

40
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,180
These two limos are identicalâ€”they even have the same license plate.

41
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,180
That way an attacker can't, for example, have a spotter tell them which car the president

42
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
left their origin in.

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,400
The limos themselves are no ordinary limos.

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,180
They weigh between 15,000 and 20,000 pounds and are built on a modified truck bed.

45
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,760
The entire car is bulletproof including 5 inch thick bulletproof windows.

46
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,360
The only window that can open is the driver's window reportedly so they can pay tolls.

47
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,200
The entire car is hermetically sealed to protect the president from a chemical attack and on

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,680
board are rocket powered grenades, night vision optics, a tear gas cannon, pump action shotguns,

49
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,260
bottled oxygen, and two pints of the president's blood type.

50
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,240
This car, leading the secure package, is the United States Secret Service Electronic Countermeasures

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,240
Suburban.

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,260
It leaves the secure package because its purpose is to jam any remote activated explosives

53
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,440
along the route.

54
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,160
These two tall antennas do that by sending out a huge range of radio frequencies that

55
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,700
would block any bomb activation signal.

56
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,480
The two domes on top of the car are most likely what's known as electronic warfare sensors.

57
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,720
They're essentially radars that can detect when a rocket propelled grenade or anti-tank

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
guided missile is launched.

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,560
When it detects a launch, the car would most likely activate a number of smoke grenades

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,140
spread out throughout the secure package which would help throw off the grenade or missile,

61
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,300
but of course this is all classified so that's speculation.

62
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,120
This car is the control car.

63
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,500
It carries the most essential staff, like the president's military aide and doctor.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,460
In the event of an attack, they're both essential to the president so they break off

65
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,520
with the secure package.

66
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,960
These last two cars are both filled with secret service agents.

67
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,040
The closer one is called the halfback.

68
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,180
It carries the president's personal secret service detail.

69
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,640
These are the agents that are on the president's person at all times.

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,520
The second one is the cat carâ€”the counter assault team.

71
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,540
You can always identify these cars since they're the ones with a back window open.

72
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,920
That's because the agents are sitting in rear-facing seats with automatic weapons ready

73
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,860
to respond to threats.

74
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:30,560
While it's hard to see, you can just make out the counter assault team in this car in

75
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,140
black battle dress uniforms and the president's secret service detail in this car in coat

76
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,140
and tie.

77
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,260
In the event of an attack, the president's secret service detail is in charge of shielding

78
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,780
and evacuating the president while the counter assault team would generally stay and repel

79
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,880
the attack.

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,740
These vans following the secure package are full of the press pool reporting on the president.

81
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:55,500
This car is called the ID car and the secret service agents inside are the ones that communicate

82
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,120
with outside counter surveillance teams that proactively identify any threat to the motorcade.

83
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,460
This black truck is the Hazardous Materials Mitigation Unit.

84
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,160
It has equipment and personnel who can identify and respond to chemical, nuclear, or biological

85
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,260
attacks on the motorcade.

86
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,920
Continuing on, you can see more press vans.

87
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,020
These motorcycles are speeding by the side because, now that the motorcade has passed

88
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,460
the exit that they were blocking off, they are going to the front of the motorcade to

89
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,220
block off more exits.

90
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,960
This car is called the Roadrunner.

91
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,500
It has a number of antennae on the top to act as a mobile communication center.

92
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,980
It connects the motorcade to the outside world through satellite and internet communication

93
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,100
systems.

94
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,420
Following this is a generic ambulance in case of injury to any person in the motorcade.

95
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,880
Like the police officers at the front of the motorcade, this ambulance just comes from

96
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,460
the local fire department of wherever the president is.

97
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,140
This last secret service car is the support car which carries more secret service agents

98
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,220
and the essential staff members.

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Lastly, these three police cars are there to make sure that, now that the exits are

100
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,940
open again, no car speeds up and enters the motorcade from behind.

101
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,940
It's important to note that this is just the standard motorcade configuration.

102
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,300
It often changes based on the environment.

103
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,780
When President Obama visited Iraq in 2009, for example, his motorcade looked like this.

104
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,580
Military Humvees led a convoy of identical Suburbans, one of which carried the president.

105
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,580
On top of the cars were more powerful versions of the anti-RPG antenna found on the normal

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,980
electronic countermeasures suburban.

107
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,020
Though motorcades are incredibly efficient, it's been reported that motorcades have

108
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,580
made the trip between LaGuardia airport and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan in

109
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,900
8 to 10 minutes.

110
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:40,900
That's a 10 mile drive that takes a normal driver 25 to 30 minutes.

111
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,580
Although, the safest motorcade is still no motorcade since it's the most exposed the

112
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,460
president ever is so the secret service will typically only use motorcades for trips up

113
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,400
to 30 minutes long.

114
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,420
Helicopters are also incredibly logistically difficult and expensive so whenever possible

115
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,040
the president will travel on Marine One.

116
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,840
Marine One isn't actually the name of a specific helicopter, it's rather the call

117
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,200
sign used by any helicopter with the president aboard.

118
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,560
The Marine Corps operates 35 total helicopters of a few different types as Marine Ones which

119
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,700
might seem like overkill, but these helicopters are also often used to transport the vice

120
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,880
president when they're known as Marine Two or government VIPs.

121
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,720
While Marine One is occasionally used to transport the president from point to point, it's

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,480
most frequent mission is to bring the president from the White House to Andrews Air Force

123
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Base.

124
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,600
The president's planes are based at Andrews Air Force Base so this 12 mile trip is how

125
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,480
the president starts and finishes any long distance trip.

126
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,240
Much like the president's limo, Marine One never flies alone.

127
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Right after takeoff, it's met by as many as five other identical helicopters which

128
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,900
shuffle positions in flight to throw off potential attackers.

129
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,860
Air Force One is also not a particular aircraft, but rather the call sign used whenever the

130
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,340
president is aboard an Air Force aircraft.

131
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:02,360
Typically, the role is served by one of two modified Boeing 747s.

132
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,920
To give you a sense of how efficient this entire transport system is, let's time a

133
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,780
trip from the White House to the UN headquarters in New York.

134
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,060
The 12 mile flight to Andrews Air Force Base takes about 8 minutes on Marine One.

135
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,980
Then, upon arrival, the president steps onboard Air Force One.

136
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,820
The president is always the last person to step on Air Force One, so the second he is

137
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,340
there, the door closes and the aircraft taxis for takeoff.

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,620
That means there's about 5 minutes between touchdown of Marine One and takeoff of Air

139
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,820
Force One.

140
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,620
From there, it's about a 30 minute flight to JFK airport in New York followed by a 7

141
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,420
minute trip on Marine One to downtown Manhattan heliport, then a 6 minute motorcade up FDR

142
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,840
Drive to the United Nations.

143
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,800
That means that, if everything goes perfectly, including transfer times, it will take almost

144
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,880
exactly one hour for the president to go from stepping out of the White House to stepping

145
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
inside the United Nations.

146
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
And what is the cost of this hour long trip?

147
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Well, it's public information that Air Force One costs an estimated $206,337 per flight

148
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
hour.

149
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,040
So this half hour flight costs $103,169, but of course we need to include Marine One.

150
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,800
Marine One by itself is actually fairly inexpensive to operate.

151
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,920
While we don't know its exact operating cost, one of the helicopters often used as

152
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:29,240
Marine One is the Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk which costs $2,199 per flight hour.

153
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,260
But of course Marine One always flies in formation with up to five other helicopters.

154
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:42,440
Per helicopter, a quarter hour of flight time costs $530 or $3,180 total.

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,840
The motorcade's cost for the short trip is fairly miniscule so we'll leave it out

156
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,040
for simplicity.

157
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,080
But the helicopters and cars need to get to New York and this is done by loading them

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:10:00,660
up on a C5 Galaxy cargo plane which costs $100,941 per flight hour or $50,471 for the

159
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,600
half hour long trip to New York.

160
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:11,660
All together, that's $156,820 for the hour long trip to New York or $2,614 per minute.

161
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,700
And keep in mind that the president needs to travel back too.

162
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:20,340
Ultimately, transportation of the president costs the American taxpayer about $350 million

163
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,040
per yearâ€”roughly one quarter of the $1.4 billion yearly White House budget.

164
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,140
This is certainly a steep price, but many would argue that it's a small price to pay

165
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,960
to keep the most powerful person in the world safe.

166
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,300
This video was brought to you by Squarespace.

167
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,780
As you probably know, I'm a big fan of Squarespace.

168
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,060
I've used them for years for a few different websites including the official Wendover Productions

169
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
site.

170
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,740
Not only do they have the best website builder out there, they're also the simplest and

171
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,700
fastest company to buy a domain through.

172
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,300
To prove that, I decided to buy a new domainâ€”WendoverProductions.net.

173
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,800
As you can see here, it took me exactly 60 seconds and $20 and now you can reach my site

174
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,540
at WendoverProductions.com and .net.

175
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,500
If you ever want to start a YouTube channel, a business, anything, you should register

176
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,820
a domain now.

177
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,580
I never had a problem because I bought WendoverProductions.com through Squarespace when the channel was

178
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,140
still small, but there are tons of horror stories of people who start a business, become

179
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,360
successful, and then have to pay thousands to buy the domain from someone who snatches

180
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,100
it up before they do.

181
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,640
Most of the domains on Squarespace are only $20â€”that's the cost of one third of a

182
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,740
second on Air Force Oneâ€”and by using the links Squarespace.com slash Wendover and the

183
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,760
code Wendover, you'll get 10% off your first order and help support the channel.

184
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,900
Other than that, you can support Wendover Productions at Patreon.com slash Wendover

185
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,480
Productions, follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro, watch my last video on every state in the

186
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:54,340
US here, check out my fan-moderated subreddit here, and most of all, subscribe to this channel

187
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,440
to receive all my future videos right when they come out.

188
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Thanks again for watching and I'll see you in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

189
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,120
video.
