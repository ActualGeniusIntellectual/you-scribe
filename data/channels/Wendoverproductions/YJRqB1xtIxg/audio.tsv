8020	12600	Moving the president of the United States from one location to another is a logistical
12600	16540	nightmare that happens every single day.
16540	20380	The American president is one of the most powerful persons in the world and there is
20380	24860	no time when the president is more exposed than when they're in transport.
24860	28660	Two of the four successful assassinations of American presidents were when they were
28660	30880	traveling—Garfield and Kennedy.
30880	35300	For that reason, the secret service devotes an enormous amount of resources to ensuring
35300	39020	the president gets from one place to another safely.
39020	43420	The presidential motorcade is perhaps the most impressive method of transportation.
43420	48060	It includes up to 40 or 50 vehicles and over 100 people.
48060	50980	Let's take a look at some footage of a motorcade.
50980	53760	This is the lead car, or in this case motorcycle.
53760	57900	As the name suggests, its job is to lead the motorcade, but it's not actually the first
57900	58900	vehicle.
58900	62540	What we don't see here is the route car which would have come through about 5 minutes
62540	64180	before the lead car.
64180	69020	The route car is always followed by about 20 or 30 motorcycles which play the essential
69020	72020	role of clearing the route of cars.
72020	76100	When driving on a highway, they'll speed ahead and close exits so that no cars can
76100	80260	come on the highway, although they have to use a different technique in cities.
80260	84820	When driving in DC, where other drivers are used to frequent motorcades, the motorcycles
84820	90140	often drive in a v-pattern pushing cars to the side to clear the way for the motorcade.
90140	93700	This leads to a disruption of only about 2 or 3 minutes.
93700	98820	Outside of DC, drivers are less used to motorcades so the motorcycles will typically completely
98820	103740	block off the intersecting streets to create one continuous clear path for the president.
103740	107780	The entire first section of the motorcade isn't actually run by the secret service.
107780	111860	It's run by the local police jurisdiction of wherever the president is.
111860	116100	The fewer secret service cars and individuals needed for motorcades, the better since both
116100	120720	the cars and agents need to travel to wherever the president is visiting in advance which
120720	123420	is, of course, incredibly expensive.
123420	126620	The next part of the motorcade is what's known as the secure package.
126620	130540	It's the essential core to the motorcade because it's the group of cars that directly
130540	132020	secures the president.
132020	135940	In case of attack, this group of cars can detach from the rest of the motorcade and
135940	137900	function as an independent unit.
137900	141880	The most important car in the secure package is the president's limo but one can never
141880	145660	be sure which one that is because there are always two limos.
145660	149180	These two limos are identical—they even have the same license plate.
149180	153180	That way an attacker can't, for example, have a spotter tell them which car the president
153180	154180	left their origin in.
154180	157400	The limos themselves are no ordinary limos.
157400	163180	They weigh between 15,000 and 20,000 pounds and are built on a modified truck bed.
163180	167760	The entire car is bulletproof including 5 inch thick bulletproof windows.
167760	172360	The only window that can open is the driver's window reportedly so they can pay tolls.
172360	177200	The entire car is hermetically sealed to protect the president from a chemical attack and on
177200	183680	board are rocket powered grenades, night vision optics, a tear gas cannon, pump action shotguns,
183680	187260	bottled oxygen, and two pints of the president's blood type.
187260	192240	This car, leading the secure package, is the United States Secret Service Electronic Countermeasures
192240	193240	Suburban.
193240	198260	It leaves the secure package because its purpose is to jam any remote activated explosives
198260	199440	along the route.
199440	204160	These two tall antennas do that by sending out a huge range of radio frequencies that
204160	206700	would block any bomb activation signal.
206700	211480	The two domes on top of the car are most likely what's known as electronic warfare sensors.
211480	215720	They're essentially radars that can detect when a rocket propelled grenade or anti-tank
215720	217440	guided missile is launched.
217440	221560	When it detects a launch, the car would most likely activate a number of smoke grenades
221560	226140	spread out throughout the secure package which would help throw off the grenade or missile,
226140	229300	but of course this is all classified so that's speculation.
229300	231120	This car is the control car.
231120	235500	It carries the most essential staff, like the president's military aide and doctor.
235500	239460	In the event of an attack, they're both essential to the president so they break off
239460	241520	with the secure package.
241520	244960	These last two cars are both filled with secret service agents.
244960	247040	The closer one is called the halfback.
247040	250180	It carries the president's personal secret service detail.
250180	253640	These are the agents that are on the president's person at all times.
253640	256520	The second one is the cat car—the counter assault team.
256520	260540	You can always identify these cars since they're the ones with a back window open.
260540	264920	That's because the agents are sitting in rear-facing seats with automatic weapons ready
264920	266860	to respond to threats.
266860	270560	While it's hard to see, you can just make out the counter assault team in this car in
270560	275140	black battle dress uniforms and the president's secret service detail in this car in coat
275140	276140	and tie.
276140	280260	In the event of an attack, the president's secret service detail is in charge of shielding
280260	284780	and evacuating the president while the counter assault team would generally stay and repel
284780	285880	the attack.
285880	290740	These vans following the secure package are full of the press pool reporting on the president.
290740	295500	This car is called the ID car and the secret service agents inside are the ones that communicate
295500	301120	with outside counter surveillance teams that proactively identify any threat to the motorcade.
301120	304460	This black truck is the Hazardous Materials Mitigation Unit.
304460	310160	It has equipment and personnel who can identify and respond to chemical, nuclear, or biological
310160	312260	attacks on the motorcade.
312260	314920	Continuing on, you can see more press vans.
314920	319020	These motorcycles are speeding by the side because, now that the motorcade has passed
319020	322460	the exit that they were blocking off, they are going to the front of the motorcade to
322460	324220	block off more exits.
324220	325960	This car is called the Roadrunner.
325960	330500	It has a number of antennae on the top to act as a mobile communication center.
330500	334980	It connects the motorcade to the outside world through satellite and internet communication
334980	336100	systems.
336100	340420	Following this is a generic ambulance in case of injury to any person in the motorcade.
340420	343880	Like the police officers at the front of the motorcade, this ambulance just comes from
343880	347460	the local fire department of wherever the president is.
347460	352140	This last secret service car is the support car which carries more secret service agents
352140	354220	and the essential staff members.
354220	358220	Lastly, these three police cars are there to make sure that, now that the exits are
358220	361940	open again, no car speeds up and enters the motorcade from behind.
361940	365940	It's important to note that this is just the standard motorcade configuration.
365940	368300	It often changes based on the environment.
368300	373780	When President Obama visited Iraq in 2009, for example, his motorcade looked like this.
373780	378580	Military Humvees led a convoy of identical Suburbans, one of which carried the president.
378580	383580	On top of the cars were more powerful versions of the anti-RPG antenna found on the normal
383580	385980	electronic countermeasures suburban.
385980	390020	Though motorcades are incredibly efficient, it's been reported that motorcades have
390020	394580	made the trip between LaGuardia airport and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan in
394580	395900	8 to 10 minutes.
395900	400900	That's a 10 mile drive that takes a normal driver 25 to 30 minutes.
400900	405580	Although, the safest motorcade is still no motorcade since it's the most exposed the
405580	410460	president ever is so the secret service will typically only use motorcades for trips up
410460	412400	to 30 minutes long.
412400	417420	Helicopters are also incredibly logistically difficult and expensive so whenever possible
417420	420040	the president will travel on Marine One.
420040	423840	Marine One isn't actually the name of a specific helicopter, it's rather the call
423840	427200	sign used by any helicopter with the president aboard.
427200	432560	The Marine Corps operates 35 total helicopters of a few different types as Marine Ones which
432560	436700	might seem like overkill, but these helicopters are also often used to transport the vice
436700	440880	president when they're known as Marine Two or government VIPs.
440880	444720	While Marine One is occasionally used to transport the president from point to point, it's
444720	448480	most frequent mission is to bring the president from the White House to Andrews Air Force
448480	449480	Base.
449480	453600	The president's planes are based at Andrews Air Force Base so this 12 mile trip is how
453600	457480	the president starts and finishes any long distance trip.
457480	461240	Much like the president's limo, Marine One never flies alone.
461240	465880	Right after takeoff, it's met by as many as five other identical helicopters which
465880	469900	shuffle positions in flight to throw off potential attackers.
469900	474860	Air Force One is also not a particular aircraft, but rather the call sign used whenever the
474860	477340	president is aboard an Air Force aircraft.
477340	482360	Typically, the role is served by one of two modified Boeing 747s.
482360	486920	To give you a sense of how efficient this entire transport system is, let's time a
486920	490780	trip from the White House to the UN headquarters in New York.
490780	495060	The 12 mile flight to Andrews Air Force Base takes about 8 minutes on Marine One.
495060	498980	Then, upon arrival, the president steps onboard Air Force One.
498980	503820	The president is always the last person to step on Air Force One, so the second he is
503820	507340	there, the door closes and the aircraft taxis for takeoff.
507340	511620	That means there's about 5 minutes between touchdown of Marine One and takeoff of Air
511620	512820	Force One.
512820	517620	From there, it's about a 30 minute flight to JFK airport in New York followed by a 7
517620	523420	minute trip on Marine One to downtown Manhattan heliport, then a 6 minute motorcade up FDR
523420	524840	Drive to the United Nations.
524840	529800	That means that, if everything goes perfectly, including transfer times, it will take almost
529800	534880	exactly one hour for the president to go from stepping out of the White House to stepping
534880	536800	inside the United Nations.
536800	538800	And what is the cost of this hour long trip?
538800	546600	Well, it's public information that Air Force One costs an estimated $206,337 per flight
546600	547600	hour.
547600	554040	So this half hour flight costs $103,169, but of course we need to include Marine One.
554240	557800	Marine One by itself is actually fairly inexpensive to operate.
557800	561920	While we don't know its exact operating cost, one of the helicopters often used as
561920	569240	Marine One is the Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk which costs $2,199 per flight hour.
569240	574260	But of course Marine One always flies in formation with up to five other helicopters.
574260	582440	Per helicopter, a quarter hour of flight time costs $530 or $3,180 total.
582440	585840	The motorcade's cost for the short trip is fairly miniscule so we'll leave it out
585840	587040	for simplicity.
587040	591080	But the helicopters and cars need to get to New York and this is done by loading them
591080	600660	up on a C5 Galaxy cargo plane which costs $100,941 per flight hour or $50,471 for the
600660	602600	half hour long trip to New York.
602600	611660	All together, that's $156,820 for the hour long trip to New York or $2,614 per minute.
611660	614700	And keep in mind that the president needs to travel back too.
614700	620340	Ultimately, transportation of the president costs the American taxpayer about $350 million
620340	625040	per year—roughly one quarter of the $1.4 billion yearly White House budget.
625040	629140	This is certainly a steep price, but many would argue that it's a small price to pay
629140	632960	to keep the most powerful person in the world safe.
632960	635300	This video was brought to you by Squarespace.
635300	637780	As you probably know, I'm a big fan of Squarespace.
637780	642060	I've used them for years for a few different websites including the official Wendover Productions
642060	643060	site.
643060	646740	Not only do they have the best website builder out there, they're also the simplest and
646740	649700	fastest company to buy a domain through.
649700	654300	To prove that, I decided to buy a new domain—WendoverProductions.net.
654300	659800	As you can see here, it took me exactly 60 seconds and $20 and now you can reach my site
659800	663540	at WendoverProductions.com and .net.
663540	667500	If you ever want to start a YouTube channel, a business, anything, you should register
667500	668820	a domain now.
668820	673580	I never had a problem because I bought WendoverProductions.com through Squarespace when the channel was
673580	678140	still small, but there are tons of horror stories of people who start a business, become
678140	682360	successful, and then have to pay thousands to buy the domain from someone who snatches
682360	684100	it up before they do.
684100	688640	Most of the domains on Squarespace are only $20—that's the cost of one third of a
688640	693740	second on Air Force One—and by using the links Squarespace.com slash Wendover and the
693740	698760	code Wendover, you'll get 10% off your first order and help support the channel.
698760	702900	Other than that, you can support Wendover Productions at Patreon.com slash Wendover
702900	708480	Productions, follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro, watch my last video on every state in the
708480	714340	US here, check out my fan-moderated subreddit here, and most of all, subscribe to this channel
714340	717440	to receive all my future videos right when they come out.
717440	721600	Thanks again for watching and I'll see you in two weeks for another Wendover Productions
721600	722120	video.
