00:08.020 --> 00:12.600
Moving the president of the United States from one location to another is a logistical

00:12.600 --> 00:16.540
nightmare that happens every single day.

00:16.540 --> 00:20.380
The American president is one of the most powerful persons in the world and there is

00:20.380 --> 00:24.860
no time when the president is more exposed than when they're in transport.

00:24.860 --> 00:28.660
Two of the four successful assassinations of American presidents were when they were

00:28.660 --> 00:30.880
traveling—Garfield and Kennedy.

00:30.880 --> 00:35.300
For that reason, the secret service devotes an enormous amount of resources to ensuring

00:35.300 --> 00:39.020
the president gets from one place to another safely.

00:39.020 --> 00:43.420
The presidential motorcade is perhaps the most impressive method of transportation.

00:43.420 --> 00:48.060
It includes up to 40 or 50 vehicles and over 100 people.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.980
Let's take a look at some footage of a motorcade.

00:50.980 --> 00:53.760
This is the lead car, or in this case motorcycle.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.900
As the name suggests, its job is to lead the motorcade, but it's not actually the first

00:57.900 --> 00:58.900
vehicle.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.540
What we don't see here is the route car which would have come through about 5 minutes

01:02.540 --> 01:04.180
before the lead car.

01:04.180 --> 01:09.020
The route car is always followed by about 20 or 30 motorcycles which play the essential

01:09.020 --> 01:12.020
role of clearing the route of cars.

01:12.020 --> 01:16.100
When driving on a highway, they'll speed ahead and close exits so that no cars can

01:16.100 --> 01:20.260
come on the highway, although they have to use a different technique in cities.

01:20.260 --> 01:24.820
When driving in DC, where other drivers are used to frequent motorcades, the motorcycles

01:24.820 --> 01:30.140
often drive in a v-pattern pushing cars to the side to clear the way for the motorcade.

01:30.140 --> 01:33.700
This leads to a disruption of only about 2 or 3 minutes.

01:33.700 --> 01:38.820
Outside of DC, drivers are less used to motorcades so the motorcycles will typically completely

01:38.820 --> 01:43.740
block off the intersecting streets to create one continuous clear path for the president.

01:43.740 --> 01:47.780
The entire first section of the motorcade isn't actually run by the secret service.

01:47.780 --> 01:51.860
It's run by the local police jurisdiction of wherever the president is.

01:51.860 --> 01:56.100
The fewer secret service cars and individuals needed for motorcades, the better since both

01:56.100 --> 02:00.720
the cars and agents need to travel to wherever the president is visiting in advance which

02:00.720 --> 02:03.420
is, of course, incredibly expensive.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.620
The next part of the motorcade is what's known as the secure package.

02:06.620 --> 02:10.540
It's the essential core to the motorcade because it's the group of cars that directly

02:10.540 --> 02:12.020
secures the president.

02:12.020 --> 02:15.940
In case of attack, this group of cars can detach from the rest of the motorcade and

02:15.940 --> 02:17.900
function as an independent unit.

02:17.900 --> 02:21.880
The most important car in the secure package is the president's limo but one can never

02:21.880 --> 02:25.660
be sure which one that is because there are always two limos.

02:25.660 --> 02:29.180
These two limos are identical—they even have the same license plate.

02:29.180 --> 02:33.180
That way an attacker can't, for example, have a spotter tell them which car the president

02:33.180 --> 02:34.180
left their origin in.

02:34.180 --> 02:37.400
The limos themselves are no ordinary limos.

02:37.400 --> 02:43.180
They weigh between 15,000 and 20,000 pounds and are built on a modified truck bed.

02:43.180 --> 02:47.760
The entire car is bulletproof including 5 inch thick bulletproof windows.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.360
The only window that can open is the driver's window reportedly so they can pay tolls.

02:52.360 --> 02:57.200
The entire car is hermetically sealed to protect the president from a chemical attack and on

02:57.200 --> 03:03.680
board are rocket powered grenades, night vision optics, a tear gas cannon, pump action shotguns,

03:03.680 --> 03:07.260
bottled oxygen, and two pints of the president's blood type.

03:07.260 --> 03:12.240
This car, leading the secure package, is the United States Secret Service Electronic Countermeasures

03:12.240 --> 03:13.240
Suburban.

03:13.240 --> 03:18.260
It leaves the secure package because its purpose is to jam any remote activated explosives

03:18.260 --> 03:19.440
along the route.

03:19.440 --> 03:24.160
These two tall antennas do that by sending out a huge range of radio frequencies that

03:24.160 --> 03:26.700
would block any bomb activation signal.

03:26.700 --> 03:31.480
The two domes on top of the car are most likely what's known as electronic warfare sensors.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.720
They're essentially radars that can detect when a rocket propelled grenade or anti-tank

03:35.720 --> 03:37.440
guided missile is launched.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.560
When it detects a launch, the car would most likely activate a number of smoke grenades

03:41.560 --> 03:46.140
spread out throughout the secure package which would help throw off the grenade or missile,

03:46.140 --> 03:49.300
but of course this is all classified so that's speculation.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.120
This car is the control car.

03:51.120 --> 03:55.500
It carries the most essential staff, like the president's military aide and doctor.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.460
In the event of an attack, they're both essential to the president so they break off

03:59.460 --> 04:01.520
with the secure package.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.960
These last two cars are both filled with secret service agents.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.040
The closer one is called the halfback.

04:07.040 --> 04:10.180
It carries the president's personal secret service detail.

04:10.180 --> 04:13.640
These are the agents that are on the president's person at all times.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.520
The second one is the cat car—the counter assault team.

04:16.520 --> 04:20.540
You can always identify these cars since they're the ones with a back window open.

04:20.540 --> 04:24.920
That's because the agents are sitting in rear-facing seats with automatic weapons ready

04:24.920 --> 04:26.860
to respond to threats.

04:26.860 --> 04:30.560
While it's hard to see, you can just make out the counter assault team in this car in

04:30.560 --> 04:35.140
black battle dress uniforms and the president's secret service detail in this car in coat

04:35.140 --> 04:36.140
and tie.

04:36.140 --> 04:40.260
In the event of an attack, the president's secret service detail is in charge of shielding

04:40.260 --> 04:44.780
and evacuating the president while the counter assault team would generally stay and repel

04:44.780 --> 04:45.880
the attack.

04:45.880 --> 04:50.740
These vans following the secure package are full of the press pool reporting on the president.

04:50.740 --> 04:55.500
This car is called the ID car and the secret service agents inside are the ones that communicate

04:55.500 --> 05:01.120
with outside counter surveillance teams that proactively identify any threat to the motorcade.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.460
This black truck is the Hazardous Materials Mitigation Unit.

05:04.460 --> 05:10.160
It has equipment and personnel who can identify and respond to chemical, nuclear, or biological

05:10.160 --> 05:12.260
attacks on the motorcade.

05:12.260 --> 05:14.920
Continuing on, you can see more press vans.

05:14.920 --> 05:19.020
These motorcycles are speeding by the side because, now that the motorcade has passed

05:19.020 --> 05:22.460
the exit that they were blocking off, they are going to the front of the motorcade to

05:22.460 --> 05:24.220
block off more exits.

05:24.220 --> 05:25.960
This car is called the Roadrunner.

05:25.960 --> 05:30.500
It has a number of antennae on the top to act as a mobile communication center.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.980
It connects the motorcade to the outside world through satellite and internet communication

05:34.980 --> 05:36.100
systems.

05:36.100 --> 05:40.420
Following this is a generic ambulance in case of injury to any person in the motorcade.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.880
Like the police officers at the front of the motorcade, this ambulance just comes from

05:43.880 --> 05:47.460
the local fire department of wherever the president is.

05:47.460 --> 05:52.140
This last secret service car is the support car which carries more secret service agents

05:52.140 --> 05:54.220
and the essential staff members.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.220
Lastly, these three police cars are there to make sure that, now that the exits are

05:58.220 --> 06:01.940
open again, no car speeds up and enters the motorcade from behind.

06:01.940 --> 06:05.940
It's important to note that this is just the standard motorcade configuration.

06:05.940 --> 06:08.300
It often changes based on the environment.

06:08.300 --> 06:13.780
When President Obama visited Iraq in 2009, for example, his motorcade looked like this.

06:13.780 --> 06:18.580
Military Humvees led a convoy of identical Suburbans, one of which carried the president.

06:18.580 --> 06:23.580
On top of the cars were more powerful versions of the anti-RPG antenna found on the normal

06:23.580 --> 06:25.980
electronic countermeasures suburban.

06:25.980 --> 06:30.020
Though motorcades are incredibly efficient, it's been reported that motorcades have

06:30.020 --> 06:34.580
made the trip between LaGuardia airport and the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan in

06:34.580 --> 06:35.900
8 to 10 minutes.

06:35.900 --> 06:40.900
That's a 10 mile drive that takes a normal driver 25 to 30 minutes.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.580
Although, the safest motorcade is still no motorcade since it's the most exposed the

06:45.580 --> 06:50.460
president ever is so the secret service will typically only use motorcades for trips up

06:50.460 --> 06:52.400
to 30 minutes long.

06:52.400 --> 06:57.420
Helicopters are also incredibly logistically difficult and expensive so whenever possible

06:57.420 --> 07:00.040
the president will travel on Marine One.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.840
Marine One isn't actually the name of a specific helicopter, it's rather the call

07:03.840 --> 07:07.200
sign used by any helicopter with the president aboard.

07:07.200 --> 07:12.560
The Marine Corps operates 35 total helicopters of a few different types as Marine Ones which

07:12.560 --> 07:16.700
might seem like overkill, but these helicopters are also often used to transport the vice

07:16.700 --> 07:20.880
president when they're known as Marine Two or government VIPs.

07:20.880 --> 07:24.720
While Marine One is occasionally used to transport the president from point to point, it's

07:24.720 --> 07:28.480
most frequent mission is to bring the president from the White House to Andrews Air Force

07:28.480 --> 07:29.480
Base.

07:29.480 --> 07:33.600
The president's planes are based at Andrews Air Force Base so this 12 mile trip is how

07:33.600 --> 07:37.480
the president starts and finishes any long distance trip.

07:37.480 --> 07:41.240
Much like the president's limo, Marine One never flies alone.

07:41.240 --> 07:45.880
Right after takeoff, it's met by as many as five other identical helicopters which

07:45.880 --> 07:49.900
shuffle positions in flight to throw off potential attackers.

07:49.900 --> 07:54.860
Air Force One is also not a particular aircraft, but rather the call sign used whenever the

07:54.860 --> 07:57.340
president is aboard an Air Force aircraft.

07:57.340 --> 08:02.360
Typically, the role is served by one of two modified Boeing 747s.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.920
To give you a sense of how efficient this entire transport system is, let's time a

08:06.920 --> 08:10.780
trip from the White House to the UN headquarters in New York.

08:10.780 --> 08:15.060
The 12 mile flight to Andrews Air Force Base takes about 8 minutes on Marine One.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.980
Then, upon arrival, the president steps onboard Air Force One.

08:18.980 --> 08:23.820
The president is always the last person to step on Air Force One, so the second he is

08:23.820 --> 08:27.340
there, the door closes and the aircraft taxis for takeoff.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.620
That means there's about 5 minutes between touchdown of Marine One and takeoff of Air

08:31.620 --> 08:32.820
Force One.

08:32.820 --> 08:37.620
From there, it's about a 30 minute flight to JFK airport in New York followed by a 7

08:37.620 --> 08:43.420
minute trip on Marine One to downtown Manhattan heliport, then a 6 minute motorcade up FDR

08:43.420 --> 08:44.840
Drive to the United Nations.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.800
That means that, if everything goes perfectly, including transfer times, it will take almost

08:49.800 --> 08:54.880
exactly one hour for the president to go from stepping out of the White House to stepping

08:54.880 --> 08:56.800
inside the United Nations.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.800
And what is the cost of this hour long trip?

08:58.800 --> 09:06.600
Well, it's public information that Air Force One costs an estimated $206,337 per flight

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
hour.

09:07.600 --> 09:14.040
So this half hour flight costs $103,169, but of course we need to include Marine One.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.800
Marine One by itself is actually fairly inexpensive to operate.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.920
While we don't know its exact operating cost, one of the helicopters often used as

09:21.920 --> 09:29.240
Marine One is the Sikorsky UH-60 Blackhawk which costs $2,199 per flight hour.

09:29.240 --> 09:34.260
But of course Marine One always flies in formation with up to five other helicopters.

09:34.260 --> 09:42.440
Per helicopter, a quarter hour of flight time costs $530 or $3,180 total.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.840
The motorcade's cost for the short trip is fairly miniscule so we'll leave it out

09:45.840 --> 09:47.040
for simplicity.

09:47.040 --> 09:51.080
But the helicopters and cars need to get to New York and this is done by loading them

09:51.080 --> 10:00.660
up on a C5 Galaxy cargo plane which costs $100,941 per flight hour or $50,471 for the

10:00.660 --> 10:02.600
half hour long trip to New York.

10:02.600 --> 10:11.660
All together, that's $156,820 for the hour long trip to New York or $2,614 per minute.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.700
And keep in mind that the president needs to travel back too.

10:14.700 --> 10:20.340
Ultimately, transportation of the president costs the American taxpayer about $350 million

10:20.340 --> 10:25.040
per year—roughly one quarter of the $1.4 billion yearly White House budget.

10:25.040 --> 10:29.140
This is certainly a steep price, but many would argue that it's a small price to pay

10:29.140 --> 10:32.960
to keep the most powerful person in the world safe.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.300
This video was brought to you by Squarespace.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.780
As you probably know, I'm a big fan of Squarespace.

10:37.780 --> 10:42.060
I've used them for years for a few different websites including the official Wendover Productions

10:42.060 --> 10:43.060
site.

10:43.060 --> 10:46.740
Not only do they have the best website builder out there, they're also the simplest and

10:46.740 --> 10:49.700
fastest company to buy a domain through.

10:49.700 --> 10:54.300
To prove that, I decided to buy a new domain—WendoverProductions.net.

10:54.300 --> 10:59.800
As you can see here, it took me exactly 60 seconds and $20 and now you can reach my site

10:59.800 --> 11:03.540
at WendoverProductions.com and .net.

11:03.540 --> 11:07.500
If you ever want to start a YouTube channel, a business, anything, you should register

11:07.500 --> 11:08.820
a domain now.

11:08.820 --> 11:13.580
I never had a problem because I bought WendoverProductions.com through Squarespace when the channel was

11:13.580 --> 11:18.140
still small, but there are tons of horror stories of people who start a business, become

11:18.140 --> 11:22.360
successful, and then have to pay thousands to buy the domain from someone who snatches

11:22.360 --> 11:24.100
it up before they do.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.640
Most of the domains on Squarespace are only $20—that's the cost of one third of a

11:28.640 --> 11:33.740
second on Air Force One—and by using the links Squarespace.com slash Wendover and the

11:33.740 --> 11:38.760
code Wendover, you'll get 10% off your first order and help support the channel.

11:38.760 --> 11:42.900
Other than that, you can support Wendover Productions at Patreon.com slash Wendover

11:42.900 --> 11:48.480
Productions, follow me on Twitter at WendoverPro, watch my last video on every state in the

11:48.480 --> 11:54.340
