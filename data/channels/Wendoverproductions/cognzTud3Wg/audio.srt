3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,440
For the longest while, airlines treated pilots as a renewable resource.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,660
It was long considered one of the best jobs one could have—to make good money flying

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:22,240
around the world in comfort—but as aviation has become more commonplace, the job of pilot

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,640
has too become more and more just like any other job.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,300
While in the 50's the job garnered the same respect and pay as a doctor, entering the

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,880
industry today earns you not much more than you'd make at a fast food restaurant.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,440
Before a pilot can even perform their first takeoff with passengers in the back, they

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,480
have to get licensed.

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,620
Most top airline jobs require or strongly favor those with a college diploma so for

12
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:49,120
those that want to go all the way in the field, they have to start by getting a degree.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,420
The cost of that averages $133,000 in the US and then every aspiring commercial pilot

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,860
first needs to get a private pilot's license which requires 35 hours of flight time.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,740
These first bits of flight time, which are with an instructor, typically cost about $140

16
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,600
an hour or $4,900 total.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,980
You also have to take classes which have their own fees so getting a private pilot's license

18
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,780
usually costs about $8,000 all in.

19
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,260
To start actually making money as a pilot, though, you need 15 additional hours of instruction

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,980
for an instrument rating costing $900 and an additional 215 hours of flight time costing

21
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,540
$23,500.

22
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,020
There are also tons of other smaller costs for books and housing and transportation and

23
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,900
other things which bring the total cost of a pilot's training to at least $80,000.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,160
Having done all that, having spent $213,000 on education so far, one finally receives

25
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,840
a commercial pilot's license but still, at that point, one can't work for most airlines.

26
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,800
To get an airline transport pilot license, the one needed to work for large commercial

27
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,080
airlines by the likes of Delta or KLM or Cafe Pacific, one needs, with some exception, 1,500

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,140
flight hours.

29
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,000
That would cost an additional $136,000 in rental fees alone if one were to pay for the

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,200
flight time themselves so pilots normally let someone else pay for it by working at

31
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,600
a job that doesn't require a full ATP license.

32
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,640
The most common job used to get from 250 to 1,500 hours is as a flight instructor but

33
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,960
some also work flying skydiving planes, towing banners, or for airlines flying small single-engine

34
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
planes.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,800
Once that's all done, after having been in education continuously for a quarter of

36
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,160
one's life until the age of 23 and having spent hundreds of thousands of dollars one

37
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,640
can finally start flying commercial passenger planes and earning $30,000 a year.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,000
That's a typical and even fair starting salary for a first-year first officer and,

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,480
considering these individuals often have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt,

40
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,400
young pilots are often in a tough financial situation.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Most American pilots start their commercial careers at regional airlines.

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,120
The largest of these is SkyWest Airlines which is an airline that flies for other airlines.

43
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,980
You could be flying any of the three major American airlines—Delta, United, or American—and

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,580
actually be on a SkyWest operated flight.

45
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,200
SkyWest, along with other regional airlines, operate all planes for these US airlines with

46
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,060
under 76 seats.

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,260
They fly the smallest planes which are actually more expensive on a per-passenger basis to

48
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,420
operate than the larger planes.

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,940
The regional airlines' primary purpose is to lower cost.

50
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,360
The aviation industry is heavily unionized so the major airlines would never be allowed

51
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,740
to bring in pilots at a yearly salary of $20,000 or $30,000.

52
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,220
Therefore, they contract these regional carriers to operate the small, expensive planes so

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,520
the crew can be employed at a different pay scale even if the flights are branded as United

54
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,020
or Delta or American.

55
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,500
While a first-year first officer for American Airlines makes $88 per flight hour, a first-year

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,460
first officer for SkyWest only makes $37.

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,940
Pilots are only allowed to fly 900 hours per calendar year in the US which works out to

58
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,340
75 hours per month or about 17 hours per week.

59
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,400
Now, the idea of a 17-hour work week probably sounds great but these are only the hours

60
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,640
in command of an airborne aircraft.

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,980
They don't account for the time it takes to get to the airport, clear security, brief

62
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,900
for the flight, inspect and prep the aircraft, board passengers, deplane passengers, pack

63
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:22,740
up, file paperwork, and get home or to a hotel.

64
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,660
Pilots are primarily paid based on hours in the air which is why you tend to see the more

65
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,020
senior pilots flying the longer routes.

66
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:33,240
A typical four-day trip for a regional pilot in the US might see them flying on Monday

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,640
from Minneapolis to Fargo, Fargo to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Pittsburgh, then Pittsburgh

68
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,720
to Boston where they would stay overnight.

69
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,600
The next day, Tuesday, they would fly from Boston to Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh to Boston,

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,260
then Boston to Nashville.

71
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:49,220
After an overnight they would fly from Nashville to Boston, Boston to Jacksonville, and Jacksonville

72
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
to Boston.

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,840
Finally, on Thursday they would fly from Boston to Norfolk and then Norfolk to Minneapolis.

74
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,060
Over that four-day, 12-leg trip, they would be in the air for just over 19 hours.

75
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,820
That regional pilot would have been almost constantly either working, sleeping, or eating.

76
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,960
Compare that to a long-haul pilot flying an A330.

77
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,060
They would leave Atlanta on a Monday night, fly to Amsterdam arriving Tuesday morning,

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,660
and fly back Thursday after having had a full 48 hours free in Amsterdam.

79
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,000
On that trip, the pilot would have accumulated 16 flight hours—not all that different from

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,100
the hours that the regional pilot gained after working constantly for four days.

81
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,360
It's no wonder why the most senior pilots, who have the seniority to decide which type

82
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,480
of plane and routes they fly, almost always go for the long-haul routes.

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,240
Meanwhile, while the young pilots don't get paid much and work tougher schedules,

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,000
the advantage for them of working for these regional airlines is that they can gain the

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,040
experience and hours needed to get a job at a more desirable airline.

86
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,060
The problem that the airline industry is facing is that not enough people are willing to put

87
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,440
themselves through all the years of expensive training, low pay, and long hours to get to

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,200
the stage where they make the good money and fly the most interesting routes.

89
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,240
There is a shortage of pilots but it's hard to know how bad this shortage is.

90
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,280
Some say it's a myth, others will say it's already chronic, but by one estimate the US

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,460
alone will have 1,600 pilot jobs unfilled by 2020.

92
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,960
While the problem is only predicted to get worse, the shortage of pilots is already having

93
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,960
consequences.

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,360
Emirates Airlines denies having any pilot shortage but the reality is that in April

95
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,640
2018, they flew 36 777s and 10 A380s over to Dubai World Central Airport—a less busy

96
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,520
airport than the main Dubai airport—and left those airplanes there on the ground for

97
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,960
months because there just weren't enough pilots to fly them.

98
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,500
The concerning thing is, Emirates pilots are some of the best paid in the industry.

99
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,800
Even young Emirates pilots make more than $200,000 per year and, thanks to local laws,

100
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
that's tax-free income.

101
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,560
Emirates has come under criticism for long work hours, insufficient rest periods, and

102
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,440
minimal pilot staffing for their longest haul flights which is likely a contributing factor

103
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,320
to their difficulty in attracting pilots but, if they're having trouble recruiting

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,840
pilots while paying so much, that's not a great sign for the industry.

105
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,820
These high salaries from some airlines are also a contributing factor to the shortage

106
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
in the US and Europe, though.

107
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:12,040
The UAE is a small country with two massive airlines so they rely on recruiting foreign

108
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
pilots.

109
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,520
China, while not a small country, also doesn't have enough local pilots to staff their tremendously

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,540
fast-growing airline industry.

111
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,120
The country's airlines therefore pay a starting salary of $312,000 per year to foreign

112
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,140
pilots and some make up to half a million dollars.

113
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,120
While working conditions are tough, it's still no wonder why 10% of all pilots in China

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,520
are now foreigners.

115
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,100
With more and more pilots heading overseas to the best paying pilot jobs, the US, Europe,

116
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,700
and other western countries are left with fewer and fewer people to fly their planes.

117
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,460
The short-term solution for airlines in the US has been to fast-track pilots through the

118
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,620
early phase of their careers flying small jets for low pay and get more pilots flying

119
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,600
the larger planes earlier.

120
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,760
That leaves the brunt of the impact of this shortage on small towns served by these small

121
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
planes.

122
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:04,420
US airlines especially, thanks to the country's vastness, operate with route networks emphasizing

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,460
service to small airports.

124
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,780
Rather amazingly, there are 553 airports in the US with commercial service.

125
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,340
United is perhaps the most focused among the big three US airlines on small town service

126
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:21,880
with 235 domestic destinations but, due to the lack of pilots, it's having to cancel

127
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
routes.

128
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,580
In September 2018 alone, the airlines stopped service from Chicago to Willard, Illinois,

129
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:32,240
Mobile, Alabama, and Manchester, New Hampshire even though these routes were likely profitable.

130
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,660
United isn't alone in this.

131
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,180
Horizon Air, the subsidiary operating Alaska Airlines' regional flights, had to cancel

132
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,720
thousands of flights in 2017 due to a severe lack of pilots.

133
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,060
There are a couple of possible solutions to this crisis.

134
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,220
The most obvious one is to increase pay and to improve working conditions but, from the

135
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,760
airlines' perspectives, that's the last ditch solution as they focus on their bottom

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,760
lines.

137
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,900
While it's tough to sympathize with these billion dollar businesses losing money as

138
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,820
a result of paying a more livable wage, the reality is that if they're having to pay

139
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,100
more for the pilots to serve small towns, it's going to cost more to fly to small

140
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,060
towns and those living in small towns are often the ones least able to pay.

141
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,780
Another commonly proposed solution is to attract more women pilots.

142
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,600
Only 6.7% of the world's pilots are female and so, by putting more effort into recruiting

143
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,600
that half of the population, airlines could potentially increase pilot numbers without

144
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,260
increasing pay.

145
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,100
More and more airlines, such as Lufthansa and Emirates, are also operating their own

146
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,860
flight schools where cadets can train for reduced rates or for free as long as they

147
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,180
end up working at the airline.

148
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,180
Airlines are also working to reduce the number of pilots needed.

149
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,940
Emirates, for example, reduced the number of pilots it uses on some of its longest flights.

150
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,660
On the 13 hour flight from Dubai to Sydney, for example, they now only staff three pilots

151
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,600
instead of four which means that each only gets four hours of in-flight rest instead

152
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
of six.

153
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,180
Finally, one of the more controversial proposals to fix this issue has been to increase automation

154
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:03,120
in the cockpit to the point where only one or possibly zero pilots are needed to fly.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,660
This proposal has met criticism from pilots, cabin crew, and the public alike as many opponents

156
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,240
point out that the cockpit is already highly automated and the pilot's main role is to

157
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,300
troubleshoot if things go wrong.

158
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,940
Nonetheless, with captains of wide-body planes earning more than $300 per flight hour, the

159
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,740
cost of crewing the cockpit can be as much as $19,000 each way on the longest flights

160
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,720
like San Francisco to Singapore so there's certainly financial pressure on airlines to

161
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,300
cut down the need for pilots if they can.

162
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:33,100
There are thousands of people who become pilots each year but there are millions more who

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,820
want to become pilots.

164
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,980
To bring more people into the industry all airlines need to do is to lower the extraordinarily

165
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,020
high barrier to entry since as the industry grows worldwide the allure of the skies won't

166
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,860
be enough to get enough pilots into the cockpit.

167
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,300
If you want to become a pilot, two of the major things you absolutely need to have a

168
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,180
solid grasp of are math and physics.

169
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,580
Brilliant is a great place to learn those two subjects since their courses break down

170
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,460
concepts into their intuitive principles and build them back up so you don't just memorize

171
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,840
how to do something, you understand it.

172
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,260
They also have plenty of other courses on super interesting subjects like logic, probability,

173
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,580
astronomy, machine learning, and more.

174
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:15,820
They really put a lot of work into perfecting each and every course they have and best of
