00:09.320 --> 00:13.440
For the longest while, airlines treated pilots as a renewable resource.

00:13.440 --> 00:17.660
It was long considered one of the best jobs one could have—to make good money flying

00:17.660 --> 00:22.240
around the world in comfort—but as aviation has become more commonplace, the job of pilot

00:22.240 --> 00:25.640
has too become more and more just like any other job.

00:26.080 --> 00:30.300
While in the 50's the job garnered the same respect and pay as a doctor, entering the

00:30.300 --> 00:34.880
industry today earns you not much more than you'd make at a fast food restaurant.

00:34.880 --> 00:38.440
Before a pilot can even perform their first takeoff with passengers in the back, they

00:38.440 --> 00:40.480
have to get licensed.

00:40.480 --> 00:44.620
Most top airline jobs require or strongly favor those with a college diploma so for

00:44.620 --> 00:49.120
those that want to go all the way in the field, they have to start by getting a degree.

00:49.120 --> 00:55.420
The cost of that averages $133,000 in the US and then every aspiring commercial pilot

00:55.420 --> 01:00.860
first needs to get a private pilot's license which requires 35 hours of flight time.

01:00.860 --> 01:05.740
These first bits of flight time, which are with an instructor, typically cost about $140

01:05.740 --> 01:08.600
an hour or $4,900 total.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.980
You also have to take classes which have their own fees so getting a private pilot's license

01:12.980 --> 01:15.780
usually costs about $8,000 all in.

01:15.780 --> 01:20.260
To start actually making money as a pilot, though, you need 15 additional hours of instruction

01:20.260 --> 01:25.980
for an instrument rating costing $900 and an additional 215 hours of flight time costing

01:25.980 --> 01:28.540
$23,500.

01:28.540 --> 01:33.020
There are also tons of other smaller costs for books and housing and transportation and

01:33.020 --> 01:38.900
other things which bring the total cost of a pilot's training to at least $80,000.

01:38.900 --> 01:45.160
Having done all that, having spent $213,000 on education so far, one finally receives

01:45.160 --> 01:50.840
a commercial pilot's license but still, at that point, one can't work for most airlines.

01:50.840 --> 01:54.800
To get an airline transport pilot license, the one needed to work for large commercial

01:54.800 --> 02:01.080
airlines by the likes of Delta or KLM or Cafe Pacific, one needs, with some exception, 1,500

02:01.080 --> 02:02.140
flight hours.

02:02.140 --> 02:08.000
That would cost an additional $136,000 in rental fees alone if one were to pay for the

02:08.000 --> 02:12.200
flight time themselves so pilots normally let someone else pay for it by working at

02:12.200 --> 02:15.600
a job that doesn't require a full ATP license.

02:15.600 --> 02:20.640
The most common job used to get from 250 to 1,500 hours is as a flight instructor but

02:20.640 --> 02:25.960
some also work flying skydiving planes, towing banners, or for airlines flying small single-engine

02:25.960 --> 02:26.960
planes.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.800
Once that's all done, after having been in education continuously for a quarter of

02:30.800 --> 02:35.160
one's life until the age of 23 and having spent hundreds of thousands of dollars one

02:35.160 --> 02:40.640
can finally start flying commercial passenger planes and earning $30,000 a year.

02:40.640 --> 02:47.000
That's a typical and even fair starting salary for a first-year first officer and,

02:47.000 --> 02:51.480
considering these individuals often have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt,

02:51.480 --> 02:55.400
young pilots are often in a tough financial situation.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.400
Most American pilots start their commercial careers at regional airlines.

02:59.400 --> 03:04.120
The largest of these is SkyWest Airlines which is an airline that flies for other airlines.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.980
You could be flying any of the three major American airlines—Delta, United, or American—and

03:08.980 --> 03:11.580
actually be on a SkyWest operated flight.

03:11.580 --> 03:16.200
SkyWest, along with other regional airlines, operate all planes for these US airlines with

03:16.200 --> 03:18.060
under 76 seats.

03:18.060 --> 03:22.260
They fly the smallest planes which are actually more expensive on a per-passenger basis to

03:22.260 --> 03:24.420
operate than the larger planes.

03:24.420 --> 03:27.940
The regional airlines' primary purpose is to lower cost.

03:27.940 --> 03:32.360
The aviation industry is heavily unionized so the major airlines would never be allowed

03:32.360 --> 03:36.740
to bring in pilots at a yearly salary of $20,000 or $30,000.

03:36.740 --> 03:41.220
Therefore, they contract these regional carriers to operate the small, expensive planes so

03:41.220 --> 03:45.520
the crew can be employed at a different pay scale even if the flights are branded as United

03:45.520 --> 03:47.020
or Delta or American.

03:47.020 --> 03:52.500
While a first-year first officer for American Airlines makes $88 per flight hour, a first-year

03:52.500 --> 03:56.460
first officer for SkyWest only makes $37.

03:56.460 --> 04:00.940
Pilots are only allowed to fly 900 hours per calendar year in the US which works out to

04:00.940 --> 04:04.340
75 hours per month or about 17 hours per week.

04:04.340 --> 04:09.400
Now, the idea of a 17-hour work week probably sounds great but these are only the hours

04:09.400 --> 04:11.640
in command of an airborne aircraft.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.980
They don't account for the time it takes to get to the airport, clear security, brief

04:14.980 --> 04:18.900
for the flight, inspect and prep the aircraft, board passengers, deplane passengers, pack

04:18.900 --> 04:22.740
up, file paperwork, and get home or to a hotel.

04:22.740 --> 04:26.660
Pilots are primarily paid based on hours in the air which is why you tend to see the more

04:26.660 --> 04:29.020
senior pilots flying the longer routes.

04:29.020 --> 04:33.240
A typical four-day trip for a regional pilot in the US might see them flying on Monday

04:33.240 --> 04:37.640
from Minneapolis to Fargo, Fargo to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Pittsburgh, then Pittsburgh

04:37.640 --> 04:39.720
to Boston where they would stay overnight.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.600
The next day, Tuesday, they would fly from Boston to Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh to Boston,

04:43.600 --> 04:45.260
then Boston to Nashville.

04:45.260 --> 04:49.220
After an overnight they would fly from Nashville to Boston, Boston to Jacksonville, and Jacksonville

04:49.220 --> 04:50.220
to Boston.

04:50.220 --> 04:54.840
Finally, on Thursday they would fly from Boston to Norfolk and then Norfolk to Minneapolis.

04:54.840 --> 05:00.060
Over that four-day, 12-leg trip, they would be in the air for just over 19 hours.

05:00.060 --> 05:04.820
That regional pilot would have been almost constantly either working, sleeping, or eating.

05:04.820 --> 05:07.960
Compare that to a long-haul pilot flying an A330.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.060
They would leave Atlanta on a Monday night, fly to Amsterdam arriving Tuesday morning,

05:12.060 --> 05:16.660
and fly back Thursday after having had a full 48 hours free in Amsterdam.

05:16.660 --> 05:21.000
On that trip, the pilot would have accumulated 16 flight hours—not all that different from

05:21.000 --> 05:25.100
the hours that the regional pilot gained after working constantly for four days.

05:25.100 --> 05:29.360
It's no wonder why the most senior pilots, who have the seniority to decide which type

05:29.360 --> 05:33.480
of plane and routes they fly, almost always go for the long-haul routes.

05:33.480 --> 05:37.240
Meanwhile, while the young pilots don't get paid much and work tougher schedules,

05:37.240 --> 05:41.000
the advantage for them of working for these regional airlines is that they can gain the

05:41.000 --> 05:45.040
experience and hours needed to get a job at a more desirable airline.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.060
The problem that the airline industry is facing is that not enough people are willing to put

05:49.060 --> 05:53.440
themselves through all the years of expensive training, low pay, and long hours to get to

05:53.440 --> 05:57.200
the stage where they make the good money and fly the most interesting routes.

05:57.240 --> 06:01.240
There is a shortage of pilots but it's hard to know how bad this shortage is.

06:01.240 --> 06:05.280
Some say it's a myth, others will say it's already chronic, but by one estimate the US

06:05.280 --> 06:09.460
alone will have 1,600 pilot jobs unfilled by 2020.

06:09.460 --> 06:13.960
While the problem is only predicted to get worse, the shortage of pilots is already having

06:13.960 --> 06:14.960
consequences.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.360
Emirates Airlines denies having any pilot shortage but the reality is that in April

06:19.360 --> 06:25.640
2018, they flew 36 777s and 10 A380s over to Dubai World Central Airport—a less busy

06:25.640 --> 06:29.520
airport than the main Dubai airport—and left those airplanes there on the ground for

06:29.520 --> 06:32.960
months because there just weren't enough pilots to fly them.

06:32.960 --> 06:37.500
The concerning thing is, Emirates pilots are some of the best paid in the industry.

06:37.500 --> 06:42.800
Even young Emirates pilots make more than $200,000 per year and, thanks to local laws,

06:42.800 --> 06:44.600
that's tax-free income.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.560
Emirates has come under criticism for long work hours, insufficient rest periods, and

06:48.560 --> 06:52.440
minimal pilot staffing for their longest haul flights which is likely a contributing factor

06:52.440 --> 06:56.320
to their difficulty in attracting pilots but, if they're having trouble recruiting

06:56.320 --> 07:00.840
pilots while paying so much, that's not a great sign for the industry.

07:00.840 --> 07:04.820
These high salaries from some airlines are also a contributing factor to the shortage

07:04.820 --> 07:06.820
in the US and Europe, though.

07:06.820 --> 07:12.040
The UAE is a small country with two massive airlines so they rely on recruiting foreign

07:12.040 --> 07:13.040
pilots.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.520
China, while not a small country, also doesn't have enough local pilots to staff their tremendously

07:17.520 --> 07:19.540
fast-growing airline industry.

07:19.540 --> 07:25.120
The country's airlines therefore pay a starting salary of $312,000 per year to foreign

07:25.120 --> 07:29.140
pilots and some make up to half a million dollars.

07:29.140 --> 07:34.120
While working conditions are tough, it's still no wonder why 10% of all pilots in China

07:34.120 --> 07:35.520
are now foreigners.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.100
With more and more pilots heading overseas to the best paying pilot jobs, the US, Europe,

07:40.100 --> 07:44.700
and other western countries are left with fewer and fewer people to fly their planes.

07:44.700 --> 07:48.460
The short-term solution for airlines in the US has been to fast-track pilots through the

07:48.460 --> 07:52.620
early phase of their careers flying small jets for low pay and get more pilots flying

07:52.620 --> 07:54.600
the larger planes earlier.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.760
That leaves the brunt of the impact of this shortage on small towns served by these small

07:58.760 --> 07:59.760
planes.

07:59.760 --> 08:04.420
US airlines especially, thanks to the country's vastness, operate with route networks emphasizing

08:04.420 --> 08:06.460
service to small airports.

08:06.460 --> 08:11.780
Rather amazingly, there are 553 airports in the US with commercial service.

08:11.780 --> 08:16.340
United is perhaps the most focused among the big three US airlines on small town service

08:16.340 --> 08:21.880
with 235 domestic destinations but, due to the lack of pilots, it's having to cancel

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
routes.

08:22.880 --> 08:27.580
In September 2018 alone, the airlines stopped service from Chicago to Willard, Illinois,

08:27.580 --> 08:32.240
Mobile, Alabama, and Manchester, New Hampshire even though these routes were likely profitable.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.660
United isn't alone in this.

08:33.660 --> 08:38.180
Horizon Air, the subsidiary operating Alaska Airlines' regional flights, had to cancel

08:38.180 --> 08:42.720
thousands of flights in 2017 due to a severe lack of pilots.

08:42.720 --> 08:46.060
There are a couple of possible solutions to this crisis.

08:46.060 --> 08:50.220
The most obvious one is to increase pay and to improve working conditions but, from the

08:50.220 --> 08:54.760
airlines' perspectives, that's the last ditch solution as they focus on their bottom

08:54.760 --> 08:55.760
lines.

08:55.760 --> 08:58.900
While it's tough to sympathize with these billion dollar businesses losing money as

08:58.900 --> 09:02.820
a result of paying a more livable wage, the reality is that if they're having to pay

09:02.820 --> 09:07.100
more for the pilots to serve small towns, it's going to cost more to fly to small

09:07.100 --> 09:12.060
towns and those living in small towns are often the ones least able to pay.

09:12.060 --> 09:15.780
Another commonly proposed solution is to attract more women pilots.

09:15.780 --> 09:20.600
Only 6.7% of the world's pilots are female and so, by putting more effort into recruiting

09:20.600 --> 09:24.600
that half of the population, airlines could potentially increase pilot numbers without

09:24.600 --> 09:26.260
increasing pay.

09:26.260 --> 09:30.100
More and more airlines, such as Lufthansa and Emirates, are also operating their own

09:30.100 --> 09:33.860
flight schools where cadets can train for reduced rates or for free as long as they

09:33.860 --> 09:36.180
end up working at the airline.

09:36.180 --> 09:39.180
Airlines are also working to reduce the number of pilots needed.

09:39.180 --> 09:43.940
Emirates, for example, reduced the number of pilots it uses on some of its longest flights.

09:43.940 --> 09:48.660
On the 13 hour flight from Dubai to Sydney, for example, they now only staff three pilots

09:48.660 --> 09:52.600
instead of four which means that each only gets four hours of in-flight rest instead

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
of six.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.180
Finally, one of the more controversial proposals to fix this issue has been to increase automation

09:58.180 --> 10:03.120
in the cockpit to the point where only one or possibly zero pilots are needed to fly.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.660
This proposal has met criticism from pilots, cabin crew, and the public alike as many opponents

10:07.660 --> 10:11.240
point out that the cockpit is already highly automated and the pilot's main role is to

10:11.240 --> 10:13.300
troubleshoot if things go wrong.

10:13.300 --> 10:17.940
Nonetheless, with captains of wide-body planes earning more than $300 per flight hour, the

10:17.940 --> 10:22.740
cost of crewing the cockpit can be as much as $19,000 each way on the longest flights

10:22.740 --> 10:26.720
like San Francisco to Singapore so there's certainly financial pressure on airlines to

10:26.720 --> 10:29.300
cut down the need for pilots if they can.

10:29.300 --> 10:33.100
There are thousands of people who become pilots each year but there are millions more who

10:33.100 --> 10:34.820
want to become pilots.

10:34.820 --> 10:39.980
To bring more people into the industry all airlines need to do is to lower the extraordinarily

10:39.980 --> 10:45.020
high barrier to entry since as the industry grows worldwide the allure of the skies won't

10:45.020 --> 10:48.860
be enough to get enough pilots into the cockpit.

10:48.860 --> 10:52.300
If you want to become a pilot, two of the major things you absolutely need to have a

10:52.300 --> 10:55.180
solid grasp of are math and physics.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.580
Brilliant is a great place to learn those two subjects since their courses break down

10:58.580 --> 11:02.460
concepts into their intuitive principles and build them back up so you don't just memorize

11:02.460 --> 11:04.840
how to do something, you understand it.

11:04.840 --> 11:09.260
They also have plenty of other courses on super interesting subjects like logic, probability,

11:09.260 --> 11:11.580
astronomy, machine learning, and more.

11:11.580 --> 11:15.820
They really put a lot of work into perfecting each and every course they have and best of
