9320	13440	For the longest while, airlines treated pilots as a renewable resource.
13440	17660	It was long considered one of the best jobs one could have—to make good money flying
17660	22240	around the world in comfort—but as aviation has become more commonplace, the job of pilot
22240	25640	has too become more and more just like any other job.
26080	30300	While in the 50's the job garnered the same respect and pay as a doctor, entering the
30300	34880	industry today earns you not much more than you'd make at a fast food restaurant.
34880	38440	Before a pilot can even perform their first takeoff with passengers in the back, they
38440	40480	have to get licensed.
40480	44620	Most top airline jobs require or strongly favor those with a college diploma so for
44620	49120	those that want to go all the way in the field, they have to start by getting a degree.
49120	55420	The cost of that averages $133,000 in the US and then every aspiring commercial pilot
55420	60860	first needs to get a private pilot's license which requires 35 hours of flight time.
60860	65740	These first bits of flight time, which are with an instructor, typically cost about $140
65740	68600	an hour or $4,900 total.
68600	72980	You also have to take classes which have their own fees so getting a private pilot's license
72980	75780	usually costs about $8,000 all in.
75780	80260	To start actually making money as a pilot, though, you need 15 additional hours of instruction
80260	85980	for an instrument rating costing $900 and an additional 215 hours of flight time costing
85980	88540	$23,500.
88540	93020	There are also tons of other smaller costs for books and housing and transportation and
93020	98900	other things which bring the total cost of a pilot's training to at least $80,000.
98900	105160	Having done all that, having spent $213,000 on education so far, one finally receives
105160	110840	a commercial pilot's license but still, at that point, one can't work for most airlines.
110840	114800	To get an airline transport pilot license, the one needed to work for large commercial
114800	121080	airlines by the likes of Delta or KLM or Cafe Pacific, one needs, with some exception, 1,500
121080	122140	flight hours.
122140	128000	That would cost an additional $136,000 in rental fees alone if one were to pay for the
128000	132200	flight time themselves so pilots normally let someone else pay for it by working at
132200	135600	a job that doesn't require a full ATP license.
135600	140640	The most common job used to get from 250 to 1,500 hours is as a flight instructor but
140640	145960	some also work flying skydiving planes, towing banners, or for airlines flying small single-engine
145960	146960	planes.
146960	150800	Once that's all done, after having been in education continuously for a quarter of
150800	155160	one's life until the age of 23 and having spent hundreds of thousands of dollars one
155160	160640	can finally start flying commercial passenger planes and earning $30,000 a year.
160640	167000	That's a typical and even fair starting salary for a first-year first officer and,
167000	171480	considering these individuals often have tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt,
171480	175400	young pilots are often in a tough financial situation.
175400	179400	Most American pilots start their commercial careers at regional airlines.
179400	184120	The largest of these is SkyWest Airlines which is an airline that flies for other airlines.
184120	188980	You could be flying any of the three major American airlines—Delta, United, or American—and
188980	191580	actually be on a SkyWest operated flight.
191580	196200	SkyWest, along with other regional airlines, operate all planes for these US airlines with
196200	198060	under 76 seats.
198060	202260	They fly the smallest planes which are actually more expensive on a per-passenger basis to
202260	204420	operate than the larger planes.
204420	207940	The regional airlines' primary purpose is to lower cost.
207940	212360	The aviation industry is heavily unionized so the major airlines would never be allowed
212360	216740	to bring in pilots at a yearly salary of $20,000 or $30,000.
216740	221220	Therefore, they contract these regional carriers to operate the small, expensive planes so
221220	225520	the crew can be employed at a different pay scale even if the flights are branded as United
225520	227020	or Delta or American.
227020	232500	While a first-year first officer for American Airlines makes $88 per flight hour, a first-year
232500	236460	first officer for SkyWest only makes $37.
236460	240940	Pilots are only allowed to fly 900 hours per calendar year in the US which works out to
240940	244340	75 hours per month or about 17 hours per week.
244340	249400	Now, the idea of a 17-hour work week probably sounds great but these are only the hours
249400	251640	in command of an airborne aircraft.
251640	254980	They don't account for the time it takes to get to the airport, clear security, brief
254980	258900	for the flight, inspect and prep the aircraft, board passengers, deplane passengers, pack
258900	262740	up, file paperwork, and get home or to a hotel.
262740	266660	Pilots are primarily paid based on hours in the air which is why you tend to see the more
266660	269020	senior pilots flying the longer routes.
269020	273240	A typical four-day trip for a regional pilot in the US might see them flying on Monday
273240	277640	from Minneapolis to Fargo, Fargo to Minneapolis, Minneapolis to Pittsburgh, then Pittsburgh
277640	279720	to Boston where they would stay overnight.
279720	283600	The next day, Tuesday, they would fly from Boston to Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh to Boston,
283600	285260	then Boston to Nashville.
285260	289220	After an overnight they would fly from Nashville to Boston, Boston to Jacksonville, and Jacksonville
289220	290220	to Boston.
290220	294840	Finally, on Thursday they would fly from Boston to Norfolk and then Norfolk to Minneapolis.
294840	300060	Over that four-day, 12-leg trip, they would be in the air for just over 19 hours.
300060	304820	That regional pilot would have been almost constantly either working, sleeping, or eating.
304820	307960	Compare that to a long-haul pilot flying an A330.
307960	312060	They would leave Atlanta on a Monday night, fly to Amsterdam arriving Tuesday morning,
312060	316660	and fly back Thursday after having had a full 48 hours free in Amsterdam.
316660	321000	On that trip, the pilot would have accumulated 16 flight hours—not all that different from
321000	325100	the hours that the regional pilot gained after working constantly for four days.
325100	329360	It's no wonder why the most senior pilots, who have the seniority to decide which type
329360	333480	of plane and routes they fly, almost always go for the long-haul routes.
333480	337240	Meanwhile, while the young pilots don't get paid much and work tougher schedules,
337240	341000	the advantage for them of working for these regional airlines is that they can gain the
341000	345040	experience and hours needed to get a job at a more desirable airline.
345040	349060	The problem that the airline industry is facing is that not enough people are willing to put
349060	353440	themselves through all the years of expensive training, low pay, and long hours to get to
353440	357200	the stage where they make the good money and fly the most interesting routes.
357240	361240	There is a shortage of pilots but it's hard to know how bad this shortage is.
361240	365280	Some say it's a myth, others will say it's already chronic, but by one estimate the US
365280	369460	alone will have 1,600 pilot jobs unfilled by 2020.
369460	373960	While the problem is only predicted to get worse, the shortage of pilots is already having
373960	374960	consequences.
374960	379360	Emirates Airlines denies having any pilot shortage but the reality is that in April
379360	385640	2018, they flew 36 777s and 10 A380s over to Dubai World Central Airport—a less busy
385640	389520	airport than the main Dubai airport—and left those airplanes there on the ground for
389520	392960	months because there just weren't enough pilots to fly them.
392960	397500	The concerning thing is, Emirates pilots are some of the best paid in the industry.
397500	402800	Even young Emirates pilots make more than $200,000 per year and, thanks to local laws,
402800	404600	that's tax-free income.
404600	408560	Emirates has come under criticism for long work hours, insufficient rest periods, and
408560	412440	minimal pilot staffing for their longest haul flights which is likely a contributing factor
412440	416320	to their difficulty in attracting pilots but, if they're having trouble recruiting
416320	420840	pilots while paying so much, that's not a great sign for the industry.
420840	424820	These high salaries from some airlines are also a contributing factor to the shortage
424820	426820	in the US and Europe, though.
426820	432040	The UAE is a small country with two massive airlines so they rely on recruiting foreign
432040	433040	pilots.
433040	437520	China, while not a small country, also doesn't have enough local pilots to staff their tremendously
437520	439540	fast-growing airline industry.
439540	445120	The country's airlines therefore pay a starting salary of $312,000 per year to foreign
445120	449140	pilots and some make up to half a million dollars.
449140	454120	While working conditions are tough, it's still no wonder why 10% of all pilots in China
454120	455520	are now foreigners.
455520	460100	With more and more pilots heading overseas to the best paying pilot jobs, the US, Europe,
460100	464700	and other western countries are left with fewer and fewer people to fly their planes.
464700	468460	The short-term solution for airlines in the US has been to fast-track pilots through the
468460	472620	early phase of their careers flying small jets for low pay and get more pilots flying
472620	474600	the larger planes earlier.
474600	478760	That leaves the brunt of the impact of this shortage on small towns served by these small
478760	479760	planes.
479760	484420	US airlines especially, thanks to the country's vastness, operate with route networks emphasizing
484420	486460	service to small airports.
486460	491780	Rather amazingly, there are 553 airports in the US with commercial service.
491780	496340	United is perhaps the most focused among the big three US airlines on small town service
496340	501880	with 235 domestic destinations but, due to the lack of pilots, it's having to cancel
501880	502880	routes.
502880	507580	In September 2018 alone, the airlines stopped service from Chicago to Willard, Illinois,
507580	512240	Mobile, Alabama, and Manchester, New Hampshire even though these routes were likely profitable.
512240	513660	United isn't alone in this.
513660	518180	Horizon Air, the subsidiary operating Alaska Airlines' regional flights, had to cancel
518180	522720	thousands of flights in 2017 due to a severe lack of pilots.
522720	526060	There are a couple of possible solutions to this crisis.
526060	530220	The most obvious one is to increase pay and to improve working conditions but, from the
530220	534760	airlines' perspectives, that's the last ditch solution as they focus on their bottom
534760	535760	lines.
535760	538900	While it's tough to sympathize with these billion dollar businesses losing money as
538900	542820	a result of paying a more livable wage, the reality is that if they're having to pay
542820	547100	more for the pilots to serve small towns, it's going to cost more to fly to small
547100	552060	towns and those living in small towns are often the ones least able to pay.
552060	555780	Another commonly proposed solution is to attract more women pilots.
555780	560600	Only 6.7% of the world's pilots are female and so, by putting more effort into recruiting
560600	564600	that half of the population, airlines could potentially increase pilot numbers without
564600	566260	increasing pay.
566260	570100	More and more airlines, such as Lufthansa and Emirates, are also operating their own
570100	573860	flight schools where cadets can train for reduced rates or for free as long as they
573860	576180	end up working at the airline.
576180	579180	Airlines are also working to reduce the number of pilots needed.
579180	583940	Emirates, for example, reduced the number of pilots it uses on some of its longest flights.
583940	588660	On the 13 hour flight from Dubai to Sydney, for example, they now only staff three pilots
588660	592600	instead of four which means that each only gets four hours of in-flight rest instead
592600	593600	of six.
593600	598180	Finally, one of the more controversial proposals to fix this issue has been to increase automation
598180	603120	in the cockpit to the point where only one or possibly zero pilots are needed to fly.
603120	607660	This proposal has met criticism from pilots, cabin crew, and the public alike as many opponents
607660	611240	point out that the cockpit is already highly automated and the pilot's main role is to
611240	613300	troubleshoot if things go wrong.
613300	617940	Nonetheless, with captains of wide-body planes earning more than $300 per flight hour, the
617940	622740	cost of crewing the cockpit can be as much as $19,000 each way on the longest flights
622740	626720	like San Francisco to Singapore so there's certainly financial pressure on airlines to
626720	629300	cut down the need for pilots if they can.
629300	633100	There are thousands of people who become pilots each year but there are millions more who
633100	634820	want to become pilots.
634820	639980	To bring more people into the industry all airlines need to do is to lower the extraordinarily
639980	645020	high barrier to entry since as the industry grows worldwide the allure of the skies won't
645020	648860	be enough to get enough pilots into the cockpit.
648860	652300	If you want to become a pilot, two of the major things you absolutely need to have a
652300	655180	solid grasp of are math and physics.
655180	658580	Brilliant is a great place to learn those two subjects since their courses break down
658580	662460	concepts into their intuitive principles and build them back up so you don't just memorize
662460	664840	how to do something, you understand it.
664840	669260	They also have plenty of other courses on super interesting subjects like logic, probability,
669260	671580	astronomy, machine learning, and more.
671580	675820	They really put a lot of work into perfecting each and every course they have and best of
