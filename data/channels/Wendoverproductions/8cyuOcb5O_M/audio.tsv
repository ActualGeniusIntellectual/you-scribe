0	5140	It's the summer of 1990. A crew of fossil hunters pulled together by the Black Hills
5140	9480	Institute of Geological Research had been searching through a ranch in South Dakota
9480	14160	for months. They'd found some good stuff—some Edmontosaurus bones—and were getting ready
14160	18480	to wrap up and return to Hill City to get the artifacts ready for display. But then
18480	22920	their truck got a flat tire, then their spare was flat, then their pump's rubber hose
22920	27440	was broken too, so they slowly nursed the truck from their camp to the nearby town of
27440	29640	Faith to get it fixed.
29640	34060	But there was no sense in them all going, at least according to paleontologist Sue Hendrickson,
34060	38500	who decided to stay back and search some more. She wanted to see if they could get one last
38500	43940	win before the summer wrapped up. And they absolutely did.
43940	49940	In a hillside not yet examined, she spotted the most obvious fossil—an articulated dinosaur
49940	55120	vertebrae was visible in plain sight. Once the rest of the crew returned, she brought
55120	60320	them to the site, and they immediately knew they'd have to delay their trip home.
60320	65340	Over the next 17 days, the Institute team removed the entire hillside above by hand,
65340	71520	they found 250 bones, then they carefully excavated each one. With each additional piece,
71520	76360	they understood the exponentially increasing scientific and financial value of what they
76360	80360	were unearthing. It was clear this was one of the most complete T-Rex skeletons ever
80360	86180	found anywhere on earth, so they made every move with the highest degree of caution.
86180	89920	On the penultimate day of the excavation, Institute founder Peter Larsen met with the
89920	94180	owner of the property they were working on, a rancher named Morris Williams. He showed
94180	98840	him the fossil, talked about its future, then Williams agreed to take $5,000 in exchange
98840	103820	for the fossil, at least according to Larsen. The exact details of that very specific moment
103820	109360	are debated and disagreed upon, as they end up being of immense importance.
109360	114400	Nature hunting is a tricky business, you see, but it can be a genuine business. It's
114400	118560	built upon the simple principle that, as things get older, they get more valuable, and some
118560	123800	of the oldest objects out there are not found in flea markets or antique stores, but rather
123800	130440	out in the wild, as yet undiscovered by humanity. But as with mining or hunting or fishing or
130440	135940	any other extractive industry, just as tricky as extracting whatever is of value is gaining
135940	138940	and maintaining the legal right to do so.
138940	142780	For the moment, the Black Hills team headed back to their headquarters in Hill City, South
142780	147660	Dakota, and began to clean and prepare the fossil, now dubbed Sue, after its discoverer,
147660	153420	for display. It was going to be the centerpiece of their brand new Hill City Museum of Natural
153420	158700	History, a museum of worldwide influence given the singular nature of its centerpiece, offering
158700	163640	pride and prominence to the small community that the Institute called home. Over the next
163640	167880	two years, community members filtered through the Institute every day to watch the work
167880	174480	on Sue as excitement grew for its grand unveiling. But on May 14, 1992, that dream was ripped
174480	180040	away in an instant, as dozens of FBI agents and National Guardsmen showed up unannounced
180040	186340	on the Institute's doorstep. They were there to seize Sue. It was now part of a pending
186340	191680	investigation led by acting Attorney General of South Dakota, Kevin Shipher. He argued
191680	193840	that the fossil had been stolen.
193840	199200	You see, Morris Williams didn't technically own his land. He was a member of the Cheyenne
199200	204160	River Sioux Tribe, so his land was technically held in trust by the federal government on
204160	209120	his behalf—that's how reservations work. Therefore, he had to get approval from both
209120	214220	the Bureau of Indian Affairs in DC and his tribe before selling anything from his land,
214220	218500	which he hadn't. So that meant there were now four different entities claiming they
218500	222900	owned Sue—the Black Hills Institute, landowner Morris Williams, the Cheyenne River Sioux
222900	228220	Tribe, and the US federal government. After a long and highly publicized trial, the judge
228220	233300	ruled that the fossil was a fundamental component of the physical land that Williams didn't
233300	238660	technically own, and therefore it was the US government's property. But bafflingly,
238660	242860	that was, in practice, a win for Williams as the federal government allowed him to send
242860	247740	the fossil off for auction, which he would get the proceeds from tax-free.
247980	252280	This was a devastating blow for the Black Hills Institute team. What they thought for
252280	257520	two years was their biggest win ever turned into not only a waste of two years' work,
257520	261940	but later untangled further into a feud with the federal government that would land Larson
261940	266940	in jail for two years due to failure to fill out a customs form to declare cash during
266940	271520	travel. The Institute team could only watch as Sue was trucked to New York, displayed
271520	276340	for weeks in a polished Sotheby's gallery, then finally put up for auction as Morris
276340	283380	Williams waited to hear how much wealthier he was about to be. The answer was $7.6 million,
283380	289140	a new record for the sale of a dinosaur fossil paid for by the Chicago Field Museum. It would
289140	293700	be Sue's new home. Now, while Sue was a remarkably complete and
293700	298580	well-preserved fossil, much of its record-breaking sale price can be attributed to the ironclad
298580	304440	legal footing of its ownership. The US government, the institution that enforces property ownership
304440	310060	in America, asserted that it was their property, and therefore the buyer could have full confidence
310060	315040	that it would not later be seized by another rightful owner—a scenario that occurs all
315040	320840	the time, even to high-profile buyers like Nicolas Cage. Many, if not most, treasures
320840	327260	do not sell with such confident provenance. After all, not all are found on private land,
327260	332500	or even on land at all. There's really no telling how many shipwrecks
332500	337660	dot the world's waters. One popular database has entries for about 200,000, another has
337660	343360	about 250,000, while shipwreck hunters themselves populate their own secretive databases with
343360	348200	unknown numbers. UNESCO, for its part, has put the estimate of global shipwrecks at a
348200	353620	staggering 3 million, a number which some scoff at from either side of the total. As
353620	358740	to how much valuable metal has sunk with these countless ships, well, that too is a mystery.
358740	362740	Some cite the number at 60 billion worth, but with the recent finding that by itself
362740	368060	makes up a third of that value, that number seems impossibly low. Most in the business
368060	372640	just don't even try to put a number on the potential value. With only 5% of the ocean
372640	377600	actually explored, and only 20% of its floor mapped, any estimate of the amount of treasure
377600	383580	held by the ocean is little more than a guess. And yet, around this impossible mystery has
383580	387040	blossomed an entire industry of shipwreck hunting.
387040	391080	Rather than pondering questions of scale, the shipwreck hunting operations, ranging
391080	396340	in size, organizational complexity, and financial backing from individual pirates to US-based
396340	401200	publicly traded companies, obsess over the wrecks they do know about, rapidly salvaging
401200	405560	what they find to maximize profit, and when they do, fighting their way through the legal
405560	409160	morose that surrounds the world of maritime salvage.
409160	413660	A shipwreck produces value in a few different ways. There's the physical material that
413660	417660	can be lucratively scrapped, there's the historical remnants that can be sold on to
417660	422600	collectors or museums, and then there's the cold, hard coinage—the tons upon tons
422600	428140	of gold and silver that made the world economy turn for the last 600 years. All three provide
428140	433620	value, but it's the latter that's turbocharged this industry since the 1980s, raising the
433620	437840	investment, the stakes, and the legal messiness to new heights.
437840	443940	Take the 1986 discovery of this ship—the SS Central America. Led by an ocean engineer
443940	449020	named Tommy Thompson, the discovery of this gold and silver stacked ship 160 miles or
449020	454560	260 kilometers off the coast of North Carolina and 7,000 feet or 2100 meters below the water
454560	460140	was the fruit of years of relentless research and crowdfunding that pulled over 160 investors
460140	465240	and $12 million together to first locate, then salvage, the precious treasure. Once
465240	469340	found using new-age technology similar to that that found the Titanic, the moment brought
469340	472540	Thompson fame and the promise of a wealthy future.
472540	478460	But the moment also begged a question that's come to define the industry—whose treasure
478460	483300	was it? Well, it wasn't the federal government's, as it wasn't a US Navy ship, and it didn't
483300	488180	fall within the Abandoned Ship Act of 1987's purview, as it was too far off the coast.
488180	492680	But it was a treasure that had been insured 130 years prior when it left from the California
492680	497780	coast on its way to the American Northeast, and the very day the treasure made landfall,
497780	504200	Thompson's Columbus America Discovery Group of Ohio was sued by 39 insurance companies.
504200	508200	The next ten years, as the case bounced between federal district and appeals courts, the three
508200	512980	tons of gold sat in an undisclosed warehouse in Virginia, picking up dust. Eventually,
512980	517540	the court sided, mostly with the treasure hunters, awarding 92% of the cut to Thompson
517540	522680	and his investors, ultimately a win, but so nearly a loss that it took 12 years to
522680	527420	figure out. Making things worse for investors and the industry's image, rather than paying
527420	531740	out the investors' returns, Thompson took the money and went into hiding.
531740	536480	Thompson's eccentricities are, of course, unique, but the actual legal complexity surrounding
536480	542060	maritime treasure hunting only compounds when national interests get involved. In 2007,
542060	547220	Odyssey Marine Exploration successfully salvaged $500 million of silver and gold coins off
547220	551940	the Portuguese coast and shipped their haul to a warehouse in Florida. Soon after, the
551940	555700	Spanish government sued, claiming that the coins weren't salvaged from a host of unknown
555700	560100	ships that had sunk in the region as the company claimed, but from the Nuestra Señora de las
560100	564700	Mercedes, a Spanish frigate that a British ship had sunk in 1804. The case headed to
564700	568940	federal court in the US, with Spain eventually winning out on its claim through an interpretation
568940	573540	of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act—that the cargo of a Spanish-owned ship, though
573540	579520	sunk, was still under Spanish ownership. Five years after Odyssey painstakingly, expensively
579520	584220	pulled it out of the water, Spanish authorities loaded the silver onto C-130s and headed back
584220	590280	across the Atlantic. For their time, the company also had to pay a $1 million fine.
590280	594060	The question as to who owns the loot that rises from the deep is one that doesn't
594060	598260	afford quick answers. There's International Maritime Law of Salvage, which provides the
598260	601900	finder much of the keep, but that's bound to lose out should a sovereign state have
601900	605980	a claim to the ship. Then there's the tricky factor that most of the accessible shipwrecks
605980	611040	happen not out at high seas, but within the exclusive economic zones of countries, further
611040	615460	limiting any claim to maritime laws. And should a ship have cannons, treasure hunters may
615460	620020	as well turn around because that warship is still seen as state property.
620020	624380	These court cases have the potential to doom treasure hunting companies. The Columbus America
624380	629420	Discovery Group of Ohio, after all, no longer hunts for sunken ships, nor does Tommy Thompson,
629420	634660	who's currently in jail. Yet, the industry still exists, there's simply too much potential,
634660	639680	but it's been forced to pivot, either collaborating with governments, or going behind their back
639680	645240	entirely. This messiness is all why, in the marketplace for found treasures, the more
645240	650340	confident the ownership, the higher an item's value. This also explains why the dinosaur
650340	656460	fossil industry has a rather specific geographic concentration. China, Mongolia, Argentina,
656460	661260	and the United States all have some of the world's best fossils, but only the US has
661260	666440	a flourishing industry. That's because, rather uniquely, the US both deems fossils
666440	670300	the property of the owner of the land on which they were found, and allows the owners of
670300	675900	fossils to do whatever they want with them—selling, exporting, anything. That's why, of the
675900	680900	ten most valuable dinosaur fossils ever sold, all came from either Wyoming, South Dakota,
680900	686420	or Montana, and why these three sparsely populated states have become the global epicenter of
686420	690980	this burgeoning industry. And within this region, there is no more influential industry
690980	697140	player than Hill City's Black Hills Institute. That's because, after that fateful day in
697140	701700	1992, they didn't give up. Within weeks of Sue's seizure, the crew packed up their
701700	706260	supplies to head to the site of a triceratops fossil found five years earlier by Institute
706260	711180	paleontologist Stan Sacristone—or so they thought. Upon arrival, they determined the
711180	716100	fossil had been misidentified. It wasn't a triceratops, one of the most commonly found
716100	721380	dinosaur fossils—it was another T. rex, a species whose fossils had been found only
721380	726620	a few dozen times in history. So, they got digging. They didn't find quite as many
726620	732400	bones as with Sue, only 190 compared to 250, but they were in fantastic condition, and
732400	737420	better yet, this time they were 100% sure the property was private and the paperwork
737420	743220	was proper. Stan, as the fossil was dubbed, was absolutely theirs.
743220	749100	Stan essentially replaced Sue. It went on to center the Institute's Hill City Museum,
749100	752860	and while they remained committed to keeping the fossil in their hometown, the Institute,
752860	757500	a for-profit venture, was still able to capitalize on its discovery since, when one discovers
757500	762500	a fossil, one gains ownership of its intellectual property. That's to say, the Black Hills
762500	765780	Institute owns the shape of Stan.
765780	770100	Considering how rare real T. rex fossils are, the vast majority seen in museums are actually
770100	774900	replica casts. In the case of Houston's Museum of Natural Science, DC's National
774900	779180	Museum of Natural History, Tokyo's National Museum of Natural Sciences, dozens of other
779180	784740	institutions and even Disney World, the casts they display are actually of Stan, and still
784740	790700	today, new replicas are being made and sold by the Institute for $150,000.
790700	795320	But Stan would only stay home in Hill City for so long. You see, Black Hills Institute
795360	801240	was majority-owned by Peter Larson, but his younger brother, Neil, owned a minority 35%
801240	806360	stake. In 2012, Peter forced Neil out of the business as their personal relationship fractured,
806360	810640	yet because of their common ownership in the business, this familial dispute spiraled into
810640	815460	a high-profile lawsuit. The court sided with Neil, agreeing that his shareholder rights
815460	819560	had been violated when he was forced out without proper process, and so they agreed that the
819560	823040	business would have to buy his share back from him. But the business didn't have enough
823040	827200	cash on hand to pay for the fair value of these shares, so instead, they agreed that
827200	832680	Neil would get Stan, estimated at around $6-8 million in value, while Peter would get the
832680	836080	entire rest of the Institute and its assets.
836080	840080	Stan was next seen at Christie's New York City showroom where, along with Monet's
840080	845420	and Van Gogh's and Picasso's, it was put up for auction on October 7th, 2020. With
845420	849800	each additional minute of bidding, the price shot skyward, far past this estimate, and
849800	856060	the world of paleontology looked on in simultaneous fascination, delight, and horror.
856060	860000	Upon the strike of the gavel, Sue was sold to the Abu Dhabi Natural History Museum for
860000	868820	$31,847,500, an inconceivable new record for the sale of a dinosaur fossil. Commercial
868820	874000	fossil hunting, as an industry, was a-lit in the 90s when Sue demonstrated its profit
874000	879700	potential, then Stan came along and poured gasoline on that fire. The entire world now
879700	886320	knows that sitting just under the South Dakotan soil are life-defining riches. Today, every
886320	890480	rancher in the state is just waiting for the day when a fossil-hunting crew comes knocking,
890480	896420	ready to strike a deal to hopefully find the next record-breaking Tyrannosaurus rex.
896420	902160	At sea, the potential gains rise even higher, into the hundreds of millions, even into the
902160	907780	billions. So too does the risk, as a shipwreck search costs a lot more than a pair of hiking
907780	912200	boots and a lunch. With a heightened risk and heightened reward, shipwreck hunters need
912200	917760	to be even more confident in who, if anything, actually has a claim to ownership. To establish
917760	922720	this confidence, rather than fighting countries, they've decided to team up and take on contract
922720	926440	work. In the midst of the multi-year legal battle with the Spanish government over the
926440	930680	treasure it found off the coast of Portugal, Odyssey Marine Explorations began work on
930680	936040	another project in the Atlantic—the hunt for the SS Gersopa. Torpedoed by a German
936040	940620	U-boat in World War II, the Gersopa was known to be somewhere off the south coast of Ireland,
940620	945900	carrying some $200 million worth of silver ingots and lying somewhere very deep. A navy
945900	950140	service ship, and one that'd require months of background research, then weeks of exploration,
950140	955420	then a high-stakes salvage process at incredible depths, the SS Gersopa would normally represent
955420	960460	a stay-away proposition. That was until the United Kingdom Department of Transport opened
960460	964940	a competitive tender process for an exclusive salvage contract of the ship.
964940	969040	In 2010, when Odyssey and the UK government had struck a deal that gave the company rights
969040	975240	to 80% of treasure it dredged up, the Odyssey eagerly got to work. After months of research,
975240	980160	the project began with, first, finding the ship. In July of 2011, the Odyssey team took
980160	985400	off aboard a chartered research vessel, pulling behind it a deep-toe, low-frequency sonar
985400	992360	system. Not long after, 300 miles or 480 kilometers off Ireland's coast and 15,000 feet or 4,700
992380	996540	kilometers below the surface, they stumbled across an anomaly shaped an awful lot like
996540	1002300	a ship—an exciting moment, but still just the start. Using their own remote-operated
1002300	1006300	vehicle, the Odyssey Explorer, the team submerged its cameras three hours below the surface
1006300	1011460	to identify the ship. With positive identification, the project entered the recovery phase, which
1011460	1016860	required a new boat. Now chartering the highly advanced seabed worker, the Odyssey team,
1016860	1021380	buoyed by a host of on-site specialty staff, began the process of getting the silver out,
1021400	1027280	and quickly, as running the seabed worker costs about $100,000 every day. ROVs equipped
1027280	1030960	with deep-water cutting tools operated from the boat managed to eventually access the
1030960	1035700	cargo holds, and exactly one year after the project had begun, the first few ingots came
1035700	1040800	to the surface. In the two years that followed, Odyssey recovered 110 tons of silver, the
1040800	1045280	UK government got its cut, historians gained access to a trove of long-lost letters that
1045280	1049080	the ship happened to be carrying, and the press reveled in what was at the time the
1049080	1054980	heaviest, deepest salvage effort yet accomplished. It was a massive success, an undeniably bold
1054980	1059100	project that the company could in part justify because it had the confidence of being backed
1059100	1063060	by the government to own the ship, rather than facing the risk of seeing that same party
1063060	1068660	in court. Such deals are becoming more common. Since 2015, Colombia has been working on what
1068660	1073300	exactly it plans to do with the wreck of the San Jose, a Spanish ship sunk by British warships
1073300	1077020	off the coast of Colombia that was carrying what's been estimated at an unbelievable
1077020	1081820	20 billion dollars' worth of gold, silver, and precious stones. Lacking the expertise
1081820	1085760	to pull the treasure up themselves without entirely destroying the archaeological site,
1085760	1090080	the country has begun the process of figuring out who to work with. Of course, with a treasure
1090080	1094680	that massive, it remains to be seen what happens, as both Spain and Central American countries
1094680	1099320	from which these treasures were mined both have made claims on the haul. But more broadly,
1099320	1103500	a trend towards governments opting to do business with marine salvage and exploration companies
1103500	1107840	offers the maritime treasure hunting industry an air of legitimacy and a sense of confidence
1107840	1112800	that should it come up with a bounty, it won't be immediately seized or contested in court.
1112800	1116460	But while available technology and newfound collaboration have ushered in a golden age
1116460	1121980	of treasure hunting, the industry is hardly held in high regard by all. The loudest opposition
1121980	1126820	has come from the halls of academia and heritage-minded institutions like UNESCO who have fought hard
1126820	1131440	to leave shipwrecks as they lie rather than ruining them for financial gain. To these
1131440	1135260	groups, these ships provide more by being left alone as they offer important fragments
1135260	1139580	of the past for researchers while also providing a modicum of respect for those who found these
1139580	1143940	shipwrecks to be their last resting spots. Somewhere, there's a middle ground, where
1143940	1147620	technology allows for profitable and safe removal, which can then go on to fund future
1147620	1151540	research and preservation of such sites without destroying them themselves, but with so many
1151540	1156280	disparate parties involved, finding such a middle ground seems far off.
1156280	1160880	A similar story is playing out in the paleontological world. With the sale of Stan and the subsequent
1160900	1165500	explosion in the fossil industry, there's a fierce debate going on over the ethics of
1165500	1170680	fossil hunting. On one side you have commercial crews like that from the Black Hills Institute.
1170680	1175140	They argue that there are plenty of fossils, and just not enough people looking for them.
1175140	1179580	Fossils sit across all depths, but they're almost always discovered at the surface. That's
1179580	1183940	because people only notice them when land erodes away to bring the bones to light, but
1183940	1188940	when it does, after millions upon millions of years of subsurface preservation, the fossil
1188960	1193820	is placed in peril. Exposure to the elements immediately starts damaging and degrading
1193820	1200000	the bones, so, if not excavated and cleaned, they'll be lost forever. Therefore, commercial
1200000	1204280	fossil hunters argue that sales motivate more people to look, which leads to more fossils
1204280	1208900	found and therefore saved. The academic side disagrees.
1208900	1213760	Plenty of paleontologists argue that the commercialization of fossils is leading to their loss, at least
1213760	1218520	to science. That's because landowners are now incentivized against allowing researchers
1219100	1222420	to do their work on their land—they'd rather wait for the commercial crews to come
1222420	1227700	and pay them for their bones. Therefore, the for-profit hunters get first dibs, and once
1227700	1233040	they excavate a fossil, there are no guarantees that it will be available for research. Sotheby's
1233040	1236980	or Christie's or other auction houses simply sell to the highest bidder, and the buyer
1236980	1242300	is under absolutely no obligation to make a fossil available to the academic community.
1242300	1247700	In practice most of the major sales have gone to museums, but theoretically, the next groundbreaking
1247700	1252420	paleontological discovery could end up in a billionaire's vacation home, entirely
1252420	1256560	unavailable to those that can do anything more than look at it.
1256560	1260840	Driven by new technology, new interest, and record-breaking sales, the treasure hunting
1260840	1266640	industry is in a renaissance—the artifacts of old are as relevant as ever. And as records
1266640	1271000	continue to break, the drama surrounding these treasures will only mount as the question
1271000	1277280	of who owns what becomes of higher stakes and higher value.
1277280	1282660	Even unexpectedly, there is a weird connection between the fields of paleontology and statistics.
1282660	1287460	That's because paleontology is all about using rare fossils to make big conclusions
1287460	1291660	about the past. That's also pretty much what statistics is about—the field uses
1291660	1296620	math to analyze limited data in order to make conclusions, and so by quantifying fossil-related
1296620	1301500	data, statistical paleontologists are able to study the past. This ability to turn limited
1301500	1306680	data into useful conclusions is exactly why I find statistics so fascinating, and why
1306680	1310660	it was one of my favorite courses I took with our sponsor, Brilliant.
1310660	1314780	Brilliant is a STEM learning platform that helps you learn by doing. They don't just
1314780	1318460	give you a deluge of text and expect you to remember everything—they use interactive
1318460	1322700	exercises to teach intuitive principles, then build these principles upon each other so
1322700	1327820	you can end up genuinely understanding something like statistics or calculus or astrophysics.
1327820	1331260	They truly know how to teach for results, which is why Brilliant is perfect for the
1331260	1334700	kind of person who wants to learn because they love it, not because they're being
