1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
It's the summer of 1990. A crew of fossil hunters pulled together by the Black Hills

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,480
Institute of Geological Research had been searching through a ranch in South Dakota

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,160
for months. They'd found some good stuff—some Edmontosaurus bones—and were getting ready

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,480
to wrap up and return to Hill City to get the artifacts ready for display. But then

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,920
their truck got a flat tire, then their spare was flat, then their pump's rubber hose

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,440
was broken too, so they slowly nursed the truck from their camp to the nearby town of

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,640
Faith to get it fixed.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,060
But there was no sense in them all going, at least according to paleontologist Sue Hendrickson,

9
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:38,500
who decided to stay back and search some more. She wanted to see if they could get one last

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:43,940
win before the summer wrapped up. And they absolutely did.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,940
In a hillside not yet examined, she spotted the most obvious fossil—an articulated dinosaur

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,120
vertebrae was visible in plain sight. Once the rest of the crew returned, she brought

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,320
them to the site, and they immediately knew they'd have to delay their trip home.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,340
Over the next 17 days, the Institute team removed the entire hillside above by hand,

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:11,520
they found 250 bones, then they carefully excavated each one. With each additional piece,

16
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,360
they understood the exponentially increasing scientific and financial value of what they

17
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,360
were unearthing. It was clear this was one of the most complete T-Rex skeletons ever

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,180
found anywhere on earth, so they made every move with the highest degree of caution.

19
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,920
On the penultimate day of the excavation, Institute founder Peter Larsen met with the

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,180
owner of the property they were working on, a rancher named Morris Williams. He showed

21
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,840
him the fossil, talked about its future, then Williams agreed to take $5,000 in exchange

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,820
for the fossil, at least according to Larsen. The exact details of that very specific moment

23
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,360
are debated and disagreed upon, as they end up being of immense importance.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,400
Nature hunting is a tricky business, you see, but it can be a genuine business. It's

25
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,560
built upon the simple principle that, as things get older, they get more valuable, and some

26
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,800
of the oldest objects out there are not found in flea markets or antique stores, but rather

27
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,440
out in the wild, as yet undiscovered by humanity. But as with mining or hunting or fishing or

28
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,940
any other extractive industry, just as tricky as extracting whatever is of value is gaining

29
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,940
and maintaining the legal right to do so.

30
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,780
For the moment, the Black Hills team headed back to their headquarters in Hill City, South

31
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,660
Dakota, and began to clean and prepare the fossil, now dubbed Sue, after its discoverer,

32
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,420
for display. It was going to be the centerpiece of their brand new Hill City Museum of Natural

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,700
History, a museum of worldwide influence given the singular nature of its centerpiece, offering

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,640
pride and prominence to the small community that the Institute called home. Over the next

35
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,880
two years, community members filtered through the Institute every day to watch the work

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:54,480
on Sue as excitement grew for its grand unveiling. But on May 14, 1992, that dream was ripped

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,040
away in an instant, as dozens of FBI agents and National Guardsmen showed up unannounced

38
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,340
on the Institute's doorstep. They were there to seize Sue. It was now part of a pending

39
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,680
investigation led by acting Attorney General of South Dakota, Kevin Shipher. He argued

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,840
that the fossil had been stolen.

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,200
You see, Morris Williams didn't technically own his land. He was a member of the Cheyenne

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,160
River Sioux Tribe, so his land was technically held in trust by the federal government on

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,120
his behalf—that's how reservations work. Therefore, he had to get approval from both

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,220
the Bureau of Indian Affairs in DC and his tribe before selling anything from his land,

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,500
which he hadn't. So that meant there were now four different entities claiming they

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,900
owned Sue—the Black Hills Institute, landowner Morris Williams, the Cheyenne River Sioux

47
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,220
Tribe, and the US federal government. After a long and highly publicized trial, the judge

48
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,300
ruled that the fossil was a fundamental component of the physical land that Williams didn't

49
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,660
technically own, and therefore it was the US government's property. But bafflingly,

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,860
that was, in practice, a win for Williams as the federal government allowed him to send

51
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,740
the fossil off for auction, which he would get the proceeds from tax-free.

52
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,280
This was a devastating blow for the Black Hills Institute team. What they thought for

53
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,520
two years was their biggest win ever turned into not only a waste of two years' work,

54
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,940
but later untangled further into a feud with the federal government that would land Larson

55
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,940
in jail for two years due to failure to fill out a customs form to declare cash during

56
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,520
travel. The Institute team could only watch as Sue was trucked to New York, displayed

57
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,340
for weeks in a polished Sotheby's gallery, then finally put up for auction as Morris

58
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:43,380
Williams waited to hear how much wealthier he was about to be. The answer was $7.6 million,

59
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:49,140
a new record for the sale of a dinosaur fossil paid for by the Chicago Field Museum. It would

60
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,700
be Sue's new home. Now, while Sue was a remarkably complete and

61
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,580
well-preserved fossil, much of its record-breaking sale price can be attributed to the ironclad

62
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:04,440
legal footing of its ownership. The US government, the institution that enforces property ownership

63
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,060
in America, asserted that it was their property, and therefore the buyer could have full confidence

64
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,040
that it would not later be seized by another rightful owner—a scenario that occurs all

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,840
the time, even to high-profile buyers like Nicolas Cage. Many, if not most, treasures

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:27,260
do not sell with such confident provenance. After all, not all are found on private land,

67
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,500
or even on land at all. There's really no telling how many shipwrecks

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,660
dot the world's waters. One popular database has entries for about 200,000, another has

69
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,360
about 250,000, while shipwreck hunters themselves populate their own secretive databases with

70
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,200
unknown numbers. UNESCO, for its part, has put the estimate of global shipwrecks at a

71
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,620
staggering 3 million, a number which some scoff at from either side of the total. As

72
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,740
to how much valuable metal has sunk with these countless ships, well, that too is a mystery.

73
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Some cite the number at 60 billion worth, but with the recent finding that by itself

74
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,060
makes up a third of that value, that number seems impossibly low. Most in the business

75
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,640
just don't even try to put a number on the potential value. With only 5% of the ocean

76
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,600
actually explored, and only 20% of its floor mapped, any estimate of the amount of treasure

77
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,580
held by the ocean is little more than a guess. And yet, around this impossible mystery has

78
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,040
blossomed an entire industry of shipwreck hunting.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,080
Rather than pondering questions of scale, the shipwreck hunting operations, ranging

80
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:36,340
in size, organizational complexity, and financial backing from individual pirates to US-based

81
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,200
publicly traded companies, obsess over the wrecks they do know about, rapidly salvaging

82
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,560
what they find to maximize profit, and when they do, fighting their way through the legal

83
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,160
morose that surrounds the world of maritime salvage.

84
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,660
A shipwreck produces value in a few different ways. There's the physical material that

85
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,660
can be lucratively scrapped, there's the historical remnants that can be sold on to

86
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,600
collectors or museums, and then there's the cold, hard coinage—the tons upon tons

87
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:08,140
of gold and silver that made the world economy turn for the last 600 years. All three provide

88
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:13,620
value, but it's the latter that's turbocharged this industry since the 1980s, raising the

89
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,840
investment, the stakes, and the legal messiness to new heights.

90
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,940
Take the 1986 discovery of this ship—the SS Central America. Led by an ocean engineer

91
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,020
named Tommy Thompson, the discovery of this gold and silver stacked ship 160 miles or

92
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,560
260 kilometers off the coast of North Carolina and 7,000 feet or 2100 meters below the water

93
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,140
was the fruit of years of relentless research and crowdfunding that pulled over 160 investors

94
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,240
and $12 million together to first locate, then salvage, the precious treasure. Once

95
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,340
found using new-age technology similar to that that found the Titanic, the moment brought

96
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,540
Thompson fame and the promise of a wealthy future.

97
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:58,460
But the moment also begged a question that's come to define the industry—whose treasure

98
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,300
was it? Well, it wasn't the federal government's, as it wasn't a US Navy ship, and it didn't

99
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,180
fall within the Abandoned Ship Act of 1987's purview, as it was too far off the coast.

100
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,680
But it was a treasure that had been insured 130 years prior when it left from the California

101
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,780
coast on its way to the American Northeast, and the very day the treasure made landfall,

102
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,200
Thompson's Columbus America Discovery Group of Ohio was sued by 39 insurance companies.

103
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,200
The next ten years, as the case bounced between federal district and appeals courts, the three

104
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,980
tons of gold sat in an undisclosed warehouse in Virginia, picking up dust. Eventually,

105
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,540
the court sided, mostly with the treasure hunters, awarding 92% of the cut to Thompson

106
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:42,680
and his investors, ultimately a win, but so nearly a loss that it took 12 years to

107
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,420
figure out. Making things worse for investors and the industry's image, rather than paying

108
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,740
out the investors' returns, Thompson took the money and went into hiding.

109
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,480
Thompson's eccentricities are, of course, unique, but the actual legal complexity surrounding

110
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,060
maritime treasure hunting only compounds when national interests get involved. In 2007,

111
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,220
Odyssey Marine Exploration successfully salvaged $500 million of silver and gold coins off

112
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,940
the Portuguese coast and shipped their haul to a warehouse in Florida. Soon after, the

113
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,700
Spanish government sued, claiming that the coins weren't salvaged from a host of unknown

114
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,100
ships that had sunk in the region as the company claimed, but from the Nuestra Señora de las

115
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,700
Mercedes, a Spanish frigate that a British ship had sunk in 1804. The case headed to

116
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,940
federal court in the US, with Spain eventually winning out on its claim through an interpretation

117
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:33,540
of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act—that the cargo of a Spanish-owned ship, though

118
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:39,520
sunk, was still under Spanish ownership. Five years after Odyssey painstakingly, expensively

119
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:44,220
pulled it out of the water, Spanish authorities loaded the silver onto C-130s and headed back

120
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:50,280
across the Atlantic. For their time, the company also had to pay a $1 million fine.

121
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,060
The question as to who owns the loot that rises from the deep is one that doesn't

122
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,260
afford quick answers. There's International Maritime Law of Salvage, which provides the

123
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,900
finder much of the keep, but that's bound to lose out should a sovereign state have

124
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,980
a claim to the ship. Then there's the tricky factor that most of the accessible shipwrecks

125
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,040
happen not out at high seas, but within the exclusive economic zones of countries, further

126
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,460
limiting any claim to maritime laws. And should a ship have cannons, treasure hunters may

127
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,020
as well turn around because that warship is still seen as state property.

128
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,380
These court cases have the potential to doom treasure hunting companies. The Columbus America

129
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,420
Discovery Group of Ohio, after all, no longer hunts for sunken ships, nor does Tommy Thompson,

130
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,660
who's currently in jail. Yet, the industry still exists, there's simply too much potential,

131
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,680
but it's been forced to pivot, either collaborating with governments, or going behind their back

132
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,240
entirely. This messiness is all why, in the marketplace for found treasures, the more

133
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,340
confident the ownership, the higher an item's value. This also explains why the dinosaur

134
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,460
fossil industry has a rather specific geographic concentration. China, Mongolia, Argentina,

135
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,260
and the United States all have some of the world's best fossils, but only the US has

136
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,440
a flourishing industry. That's because, rather uniquely, the US both deems fossils

137
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,300
the property of the owner of the land on which they were found, and allows the owners of

138
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,900
fossils to do whatever they want with them—selling, exporting, anything. That's why, of the

139
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,900
ten most valuable dinosaur fossils ever sold, all came from either Wyoming, South Dakota,

140
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:26,420
or Montana, and why these three sparsely populated states have become the global epicenter of

141
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,980
this burgeoning industry. And within this region, there is no more influential industry

142
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,140
player than Hill City's Black Hills Institute. That's because, after that fateful day in

143
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,700
1992, they didn't give up. Within weeks of Sue's seizure, the crew packed up their

144
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,260
supplies to head to the site of a triceratops fossil found five years earlier by Institute

145
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,180
paleontologist Stan Sacristone—or so they thought. Upon arrival, they determined the

146
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,100
fossil had been misidentified. It wasn't a triceratops, one of the most commonly found

147
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,380
dinosaur fossils—it was another T. rex, a species whose fossils had been found only

148
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,620
a few dozen times in history. So, they got digging. They didn't find quite as many

149
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,400
bones as with Sue, only 190 compared to 250, but they were in fantastic condition, and

150
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,420
better yet, this time they were 100% sure the property was private and the paperwork

151
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,220
was proper. Stan, as the fossil was dubbed, was absolutely theirs.

152
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,100
Stan essentially replaced Sue. It went on to center the Institute's Hill City Museum,

153
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,860
and while they remained committed to keeping the fossil in their hometown, the Institute,

154
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,500
a for-profit venture, was still able to capitalize on its discovery since, when one discovers

155
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,500
a fossil, one gains ownership of its intellectual property. That's to say, the Black Hills

156
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,780
Institute owns the shape of Stan.

157
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,100
Considering how rare real T. rex fossils are, the vast majority seen in museums are actually

158
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,900
replica casts. In the case of Houston's Museum of Natural Science, DC's National

159
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,180
Museum of Natural History, Tokyo's National Museum of Natural Sciences, dozens of other

160
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,740
institutions and even Disney World, the casts they display are actually of Stan, and still

161
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:10,700
today, new replicas are being made and sold by the Institute for $150,000.

162
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,320
But Stan would only stay home in Hill City for so long. You see, Black Hills Institute

163
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,240
was majority-owned by Peter Larson, but his younger brother, Neil, owned a minority 35%

164
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,360
stake. In 2012, Peter forced Neil out of the business as their personal relationship fractured,

165
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:30,640
yet because of their common ownership in the business, this familial dispute spiraled into

166
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,460
a high-profile lawsuit. The court sided with Neil, agreeing that his shareholder rights

167
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,560
had been violated when he was forced out without proper process, and so they agreed that the

168
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,040
business would have to buy his share back from him. But the business didn't have enough

169
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,200
cash on hand to pay for the fair value of these shares, so instead, they agreed that

170
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:52,680
Neil would get Stan, estimated at around $6-8 million in value, while Peter would get the

171
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,080
entire rest of the Institute and its assets.

172
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:00,080
Stan was next seen at Christie's New York City showroom where, along with Monet's

173
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:05,420
and Van Gogh's and Picasso's, it was put up for auction on October 7th, 2020. With

174
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,800
each additional minute of bidding, the price shot skyward, far past this estimate, and

175
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,060
the world of paleontology looked on in simultaneous fascination, delight, and horror.

176
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,000
Upon the strike of the gavel, Sue was sold to the Abu Dhabi Natural History Museum for

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,820
$31,847,500, an inconceivable new record for the sale of a dinosaur fossil. Commercial

178
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:34,000
fossil hunting, as an industry, was a-lit in the 90s when Sue demonstrated its profit

179
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,700
potential, then Stan came along and poured gasoline on that fire. The entire world now

180
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:46,320
knows that sitting just under the South Dakotan soil are life-defining riches. Today, every

181
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,480
rancher in the state is just waiting for the day when a fossil-hunting crew comes knocking,

182
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,420
ready to strike a deal to hopefully find the next record-breaking Tyrannosaurus rex.

183
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,160
At sea, the potential gains rise even higher, into the hundreds of millions, even into the

184
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,780
billions. So too does the risk, as a shipwreck search costs a lot more than a pair of hiking

185
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:12,200
boots and a lunch. With a heightened risk and heightened reward, shipwreck hunters need

186
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,760
to be even more confident in who, if anything, actually has a claim to ownership. To establish

187
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,720
this confidence, rather than fighting countries, they've decided to team up and take on contract

188
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,440
work. In the midst of the multi-year legal battle with the Spanish government over the

189
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,680
treasure it found off the coast of Portugal, Odyssey Marine Explorations began work on

190
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:36,040
another project in the Atlantic—the hunt for the SS Gersopa. Torpedoed by a German

191
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,620
U-boat in World War II, the Gersopa was known to be somewhere off the south coast of Ireland,

192
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,900
carrying some $200 million worth of silver ingots and lying somewhere very deep. A navy

193
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,140
service ship, and one that'd require months of background research, then weeks of exploration,

194
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,420
then a high-stakes salvage process at incredible depths, the SS Gersopa would normally represent

195
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,460
a stay-away proposition. That was until the United Kingdom Department of Transport opened

196
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,940
a competitive tender process for an exclusive salvage contract of the ship.

197
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,040
In 2010, when Odyssey and the UK government had struck a deal that gave the company rights

198
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,240
to 80% of treasure it dredged up, the Odyssey eagerly got to work. After months of research,

199
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,160
the project began with, first, finding the ship. In July of 2011, the Odyssey team took

200
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,400
off aboard a chartered research vessel, pulling behind it a deep-toe, low-frequency sonar

201
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:32,360
system. Not long after, 300 miles or 480 kilometers off Ireland's coast and 15,000 feet or 4,700

202
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,540
kilometers below the surface, they stumbled across an anomaly shaped an awful lot like

203
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:42,300
a ship—an exciting moment, but still just the start. Using their own remote-operated

204
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,300
vehicle, the Odyssey Explorer, the team submerged its cameras three hours below the surface

205
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,460
to identify the ship. With positive identification, the project entered the recovery phase, which

206
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:56,860
required a new boat. Now chartering the highly advanced seabed worker, the Odyssey team,

207
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,380
buoyed by a host of on-site specialty staff, began the process of getting the silver out,

208
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,280
and quickly, as running the seabed worker costs about $100,000 every day. ROVs equipped

209
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,960
with deep-water cutting tools operated from the boat managed to eventually access the

210
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,700
cargo holds, and exactly one year after the project had begun, the first few ingots came

211
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,800
to the surface. In the two years that followed, Odyssey recovered 110 tons of silver, the

212
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,280
UK government got its cut, historians gained access to a trove of long-lost letters that

213
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,080
the ship happened to be carrying, and the press reveled in what was at the time the

214
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:34,980
heaviest, deepest salvage effort yet accomplished. It was a massive success, an undeniably bold

215
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,100
project that the company could in part justify because it had the confidence of being backed

216
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,060
by the government to own the ship, rather than facing the risk of seeing that same party

217
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,660
in court. Such deals are becoming more common. Since 2015, Colombia has been working on what

218
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:53,300
exactly it plans to do with the wreck of the San Jose, a Spanish ship sunk by British warships

219
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,020
off the coast of Colombia that was carrying what's been estimated at an unbelievable

220
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,820
20 billion dollars' worth of gold, silver, and precious stones. Lacking the expertise

221
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,760
to pull the treasure up themselves without entirely destroying the archaeological site,

222
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,080
the country has begun the process of figuring out who to work with. Of course, with a treasure

223
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,680
that massive, it remains to be seen what happens, as both Spain and Central American countries

224
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,320
from which these treasures were mined both have made claims on the haul. But more broadly,

225
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,500
a trend towards governments opting to do business with marine salvage and exploration companies

226
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,840
offers the maritime treasure hunting industry an air of legitimacy and a sense of confidence

227
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,800
that should it come up with a bounty, it won't be immediately seized or contested in court.

228
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,460
But while available technology and newfound collaboration have ushered in a golden age

229
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,980
of treasure hunting, the industry is hardly held in high regard by all. The loudest opposition

230
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,820
has come from the halls of academia and heritage-minded institutions like UNESCO who have fought hard

231
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,440
to leave shipwrecks as they lie rather than ruining them for financial gain. To these

232
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,260
groups, these ships provide more by being left alone as they offer important fragments

233
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,580
of the past for researchers while also providing a modicum of respect for those who found these

234
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,940
shipwrecks to be their last resting spots. Somewhere, there's a middle ground, where

235
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,620
technology allows for profitable and safe removal, which can then go on to fund future

236
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,540
research and preservation of such sites without destroying them themselves, but with so many

237
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:16,280
disparate parties involved, finding such a middle ground seems far off.

238
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,880
A similar story is playing out in the paleontological world. With the sale of Stan and the subsequent

239
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,500
explosion in the fossil industry, there's a fierce debate going on over the ethics of

240
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,680
fossil hunting. On one side you have commercial crews like that from the Black Hills Institute.

241
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:35,140
They argue that there are plenty of fossils, and just not enough people looking for them.

242
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,580
Fossils sit across all depths, but they're almost always discovered at the surface. That's

243
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:43,940
because people only notice them when land erodes away to bring the bones to light, but

244
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:48,940
when it does, after millions upon millions of years of subsurface preservation, the fossil

245
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,820
is placed in peril. Exposure to the elements immediately starts damaging and degrading

246
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:00,000
the bones, so, if not excavated and cleaned, they'll be lost forever. Therefore, commercial

247
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,280
fossil hunters argue that sales motivate more people to look, which leads to more fossils

248
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,900
found and therefore saved. The academic side disagrees.

249
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,760
Plenty of paleontologists argue that the commercialization of fossils is leading to their loss, at least

250
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,520
to science. That's because landowners are now incentivized against allowing researchers

251
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,420
to do their work on their land—they'd rather wait for the commercial crews to come

252
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,700
and pay them for their bones. Therefore, the for-profit hunters get first dibs, and once

253
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,040
they excavate a fossil, there are no guarantees that it will be available for research. Sotheby's

254
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,980
or Christie's or other auction houses simply sell to the highest bidder, and the buyer

255
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,300
is under absolutely no obligation to make a fossil available to the academic community.

256
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,700
In practice most of the major sales have gone to museums, but theoretically, the next groundbreaking

257
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,420
paleontological discovery could end up in a billionaire's vacation home, entirely

258
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,560
unavailable to those that can do anything more than look at it.

259
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,840
Driven by new technology, new interest, and record-breaking sales, the treasure hunting

260
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,640
industry is in a renaissance—the artifacts of old are as relevant as ever. And as records

261
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,000
continue to break, the drama surrounding these treasures will only mount as the question

262
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:17,280
of who owns what becomes of higher stakes and higher value.

263
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,660
Even unexpectedly, there is a weird connection between the fields of paleontology and statistics.

264
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,460
That's because paleontology is all about using rare fossils to make big conclusions

265
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,660
about the past. That's also pretty much what statistics is about—the field uses

266
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,620
math to analyze limited data in order to make conclusions, and so by quantifying fossil-related

267
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,500
data, statistical paleontologists are able to study the past. This ability to turn limited

268
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,680
data into useful conclusions is exactly why I find statistics so fascinating, and why

269
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,660
it was one of my favorite courses I took with our sponsor, Brilliant.

270
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,780
