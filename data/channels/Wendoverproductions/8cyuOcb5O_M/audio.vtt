00:00.000 --> 00:05.140
It's the summer of 1990. A crew of fossil hunters pulled together by the Black Hills

00:05.140 --> 00:09.480
Institute of Geological Research had been searching through a ranch in South Dakota

00:09.480 --> 00:14.160
for months. They'd found some good stuff—some Edmontosaurus bones—and were getting ready

00:14.160 --> 00:18.480
to wrap up and return to Hill City to get the artifacts ready for display. But then

00:18.480 --> 00:22.920
their truck got a flat tire, then their spare was flat, then their pump's rubber hose

00:22.920 --> 00:27.440
was broken too, so they slowly nursed the truck from their camp to the nearby town of

00:27.440 --> 00:29.640
Faith to get it fixed.

00:29.640 --> 00:34.060
But there was no sense in them all going, at least according to paleontologist Sue Hendrickson,

00:34.060 --> 00:38.500
who decided to stay back and search some more. She wanted to see if they could get one last

00:38.500 --> 00:43.940
win before the summer wrapped up. And they absolutely did.

00:43.940 --> 00:49.940
In a hillside not yet examined, she spotted the most obvious fossil—an articulated dinosaur

00:49.940 --> 00:55.120
vertebrae was visible in plain sight. Once the rest of the crew returned, she brought

00:55.120 --> 01:00.320
them to the site, and they immediately knew they'd have to delay their trip home.

01:00.320 --> 01:05.340
Over the next 17 days, the Institute team removed the entire hillside above by hand,

01:05.340 --> 01:11.520
they found 250 bones, then they carefully excavated each one. With each additional piece,

01:11.520 --> 01:16.360
they understood the exponentially increasing scientific and financial value of what they

01:16.360 --> 01:20.360
were unearthing. It was clear this was one of the most complete T-Rex skeletons ever

01:20.360 --> 01:26.180
found anywhere on earth, so they made every move with the highest degree of caution.

01:26.180 --> 01:29.920
On the penultimate day of the excavation, Institute founder Peter Larsen met with the

01:29.920 --> 01:34.180
owner of the property they were working on, a rancher named Morris Williams. He showed

01:34.180 --> 01:38.840
him the fossil, talked about its future, then Williams agreed to take $5,000 in exchange

01:38.840 --> 01:43.820
for the fossil, at least according to Larsen. The exact details of that very specific moment

01:43.820 --> 01:49.360
are debated and disagreed upon, as they end up being of immense importance.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.400
Nature hunting is a tricky business, you see, but it can be a genuine business. It's

01:54.400 --> 01:58.560
built upon the simple principle that, as things get older, they get more valuable, and some

01:58.560 --> 02:03.800
of the oldest objects out there are not found in flea markets or antique stores, but rather

02:03.800 --> 02:10.440
out in the wild, as yet undiscovered by humanity. But as with mining or hunting or fishing or

02:10.440 --> 02:15.940
any other extractive industry, just as tricky as extracting whatever is of value is gaining

02:15.940 --> 02:18.940
and maintaining the legal right to do so.

02:18.940 --> 02:22.780
For the moment, the Black Hills team headed back to their headquarters in Hill City, South

02:22.780 --> 02:27.660
Dakota, and began to clean and prepare the fossil, now dubbed Sue, after its discoverer,

02:27.660 --> 02:33.420
for display. It was going to be the centerpiece of their brand new Hill City Museum of Natural

02:33.420 --> 02:38.700
History, a museum of worldwide influence given the singular nature of its centerpiece, offering

02:38.700 --> 02:43.640
pride and prominence to the small community that the Institute called home. Over the next

02:43.640 --> 02:47.880
two years, community members filtered through the Institute every day to watch the work

02:47.880 --> 02:54.480
on Sue as excitement grew for its grand unveiling. But on May 14, 1992, that dream was ripped

02:54.480 --> 03:00.040
away in an instant, as dozens of FBI agents and National Guardsmen showed up unannounced

03:00.040 --> 03:06.340
on the Institute's doorstep. They were there to seize Sue. It was now part of a pending

03:06.340 --> 03:11.680
investigation led by acting Attorney General of South Dakota, Kevin Shipher. He argued

03:11.680 --> 03:13.840
that the fossil had been stolen.

03:13.840 --> 03:19.200
You see, Morris Williams didn't technically own his land. He was a member of the Cheyenne

03:19.200 --> 03:24.160
River Sioux Tribe, so his land was technically held in trust by the federal government on

03:24.160 --> 03:29.120
his behalf—that's how reservations work. Therefore, he had to get approval from both

03:29.120 --> 03:34.220
the Bureau of Indian Affairs in DC and his tribe before selling anything from his land,

03:34.220 --> 03:38.500
which he hadn't. So that meant there were now four different entities claiming they

03:38.500 --> 03:42.900
owned Sue—the Black Hills Institute, landowner Morris Williams, the Cheyenne River Sioux

03:42.900 --> 03:48.220
Tribe, and the US federal government. After a long and highly publicized trial, the judge

03:48.220 --> 03:53.300
ruled that the fossil was a fundamental component of the physical land that Williams didn't

03:53.300 --> 03:58.660
technically own, and therefore it was the US government's property. But bafflingly,

03:58.660 --> 04:02.860
that was, in practice, a win for Williams as the federal government allowed him to send

04:02.860 --> 04:07.740
the fossil off for auction, which he would get the proceeds from tax-free.

04:07.980 --> 04:12.280
This was a devastating blow for the Black Hills Institute team. What they thought for

04:12.280 --> 04:17.520
two years was their biggest win ever turned into not only a waste of two years' work,

04:17.520 --> 04:21.940
but later untangled further into a feud with the federal government that would land Larson

04:21.940 --> 04:26.940
in jail for two years due to failure to fill out a customs form to declare cash during

04:26.940 --> 04:31.520
travel. The Institute team could only watch as Sue was trucked to New York, displayed

04:31.520 --> 04:36.340
for weeks in a polished Sotheby's gallery, then finally put up for auction as Morris

04:36.340 --> 04:43.380
Williams waited to hear how much wealthier he was about to be. The answer was $7.6 million,

04:43.380 --> 04:49.140
a new record for the sale of a dinosaur fossil paid for by the Chicago Field Museum. It would

04:49.140 --> 04:53.700
be Sue's new home. Now, while Sue was a remarkably complete and

04:53.700 --> 04:58.580
well-preserved fossil, much of its record-breaking sale price can be attributed to the ironclad

04:58.580 --> 05:04.440
legal footing of its ownership. The US government, the institution that enforces property ownership

05:04.440 --> 05:10.060
in America, asserted that it was their property, and therefore the buyer could have full confidence

05:10.060 --> 05:15.040
that it would not later be seized by another rightful owner—a scenario that occurs all

05:15.040 --> 05:20.840
the time, even to high-profile buyers like Nicolas Cage. Many, if not most, treasures

05:20.840 --> 05:27.260
do not sell with such confident provenance. After all, not all are found on private land,

05:27.260 --> 05:32.500
or even on land at all. There's really no telling how many shipwrecks

05:32.500 --> 05:37.660
dot the world's waters. One popular database has entries for about 200,000, another has

05:37.660 --> 05:43.360
about 250,000, while shipwreck hunters themselves populate their own secretive databases with

05:43.360 --> 05:48.200
unknown numbers. UNESCO, for its part, has put the estimate of global shipwrecks at a

05:48.200 --> 05:53.620
staggering 3 million, a number which some scoff at from either side of the total. As

05:53.620 --> 05:58.740
to how much valuable metal has sunk with these countless ships, well, that too is a mystery.

05:58.740 --> 06:02.740
Some cite the number at 60 billion worth, but with the recent finding that by itself

06:02.740 --> 06:08.060
makes up a third of that value, that number seems impossibly low. Most in the business

06:08.060 --> 06:12.640
just don't even try to put a number on the potential value. With only 5% of the ocean

06:12.640 --> 06:17.600
actually explored, and only 20% of its floor mapped, any estimate of the amount of treasure

06:17.600 --> 06:23.580
held by the ocean is little more than a guess. And yet, around this impossible mystery has

06:23.580 --> 06:27.040
blossomed an entire industry of shipwreck hunting.

06:27.040 --> 06:31.080
Rather than pondering questions of scale, the shipwreck hunting operations, ranging

06:31.080 --> 06:36.340
in size, organizational complexity, and financial backing from individual pirates to US-based

06:36.340 --> 06:41.200
publicly traded companies, obsess over the wrecks they do know about, rapidly salvaging

06:41.200 --> 06:45.560
what they find to maximize profit, and when they do, fighting their way through the legal

06:45.560 --> 06:49.160
morose that surrounds the world of maritime salvage.

06:49.160 --> 06:53.660
A shipwreck produces value in a few different ways. There's the physical material that

06:53.660 --> 06:57.660
can be lucratively scrapped, there's the historical remnants that can be sold on to

06:57.660 --> 07:02.600
collectors or museums, and then there's the cold, hard coinage—the tons upon tons

07:02.600 --> 07:08.140
of gold and silver that made the world economy turn for the last 600 years. All three provide

07:08.140 --> 07:13.620
value, but it's the latter that's turbocharged this industry since the 1980s, raising the

07:13.620 --> 07:17.840
investment, the stakes, and the legal messiness to new heights.

07:17.840 --> 07:23.940
Take the 1986 discovery of this ship—the SS Central America. Led by an ocean engineer

07:23.940 --> 07:29.020
named Tommy Thompson, the discovery of this gold and silver stacked ship 160 miles or

07:29.020 --> 07:34.560
260 kilometers off the coast of North Carolina and 7,000 feet or 2100 meters below the water

07:34.560 --> 07:40.140
was the fruit of years of relentless research and crowdfunding that pulled over 160 investors

07:40.140 --> 07:45.240
and $12 million together to first locate, then salvage, the precious treasure. Once

07:45.240 --> 07:49.340
found using new-age technology similar to that that found the Titanic, the moment brought

07:49.340 --> 07:52.540
Thompson fame and the promise of a wealthy future.

07:52.540 --> 07:58.460
But the moment also begged a question that's come to define the industry—whose treasure

07:58.460 --> 08:03.300
was it? Well, it wasn't the federal government's, as it wasn't a US Navy ship, and it didn't

08:03.300 --> 08:08.180
fall within the Abandoned Ship Act of 1987's purview, as it was too far off the coast.

08:08.180 --> 08:12.680
But it was a treasure that had been insured 130 years prior when it left from the California

08:12.680 --> 08:17.780
coast on its way to the American Northeast, and the very day the treasure made landfall,

08:17.780 --> 08:24.200
Thompson's Columbus America Discovery Group of Ohio was sued by 39 insurance companies.

08:24.200 --> 08:28.200
The next ten years, as the case bounced between federal district and appeals courts, the three

08:28.200 --> 08:32.980
tons of gold sat in an undisclosed warehouse in Virginia, picking up dust. Eventually,

08:32.980 --> 08:37.540
the court sided, mostly with the treasure hunters, awarding 92% of the cut to Thompson

08:37.540 --> 08:42.680
and his investors, ultimately a win, but so nearly a loss that it took 12 years to

08:42.680 --> 08:47.420
figure out. Making things worse for investors and the industry's image, rather than paying

08:47.420 --> 08:51.740
out the investors' returns, Thompson took the money and went into hiding.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.480
Thompson's eccentricities are, of course, unique, but the actual legal complexity surrounding

08:56.480 --> 09:02.060
maritime treasure hunting only compounds when national interests get involved. In 2007,

09:02.060 --> 09:07.220
Odyssey Marine Exploration successfully salvaged $500 million of silver and gold coins off

09:07.220 --> 09:11.940
the Portuguese coast and shipped their haul to a warehouse in Florida. Soon after, the

09:11.940 --> 09:15.700
Spanish government sued, claiming that the coins weren't salvaged from a host of unknown

09:15.700 --> 09:20.100
ships that had sunk in the region as the company claimed, but from the Nuestra Señora de las

09:20.100 --> 09:24.700
Mercedes, a Spanish frigate that a British ship had sunk in 1804. The case headed to

09:24.700 --> 09:28.940
federal court in the US, with Spain eventually winning out on its claim through an interpretation

09:28.940 --> 09:33.540
of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act—that the cargo of a Spanish-owned ship, though

09:33.540 --> 09:39.520
sunk, was still under Spanish ownership. Five years after Odyssey painstakingly, expensively

09:39.520 --> 09:44.220
pulled it out of the water, Spanish authorities loaded the silver onto C-130s and headed back

09:44.220 --> 09:50.280
across the Atlantic. For their time, the company also had to pay a $1 million fine.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.060
The question as to who owns the loot that rises from the deep is one that doesn't

09:54.060 --> 09:58.260
afford quick answers. There's International Maritime Law of Salvage, which provides the

09:58.260 --> 10:01.900
finder much of the keep, but that's bound to lose out should a sovereign state have

10:01.900 --> 10:05.980
a claim to the ship. Then there's the tricky factor that most of the accessible shipwrecks

10:05.980 --> 10:11.040
happen not out at high seas, but within the exclusive economic zones of countries, further

10:11.040 --> 10:15.460
limiting any claim to maritime laws. And should a ship have cannons, treasure hunters may

10:15.460 --> 10:20.020
as well turn around because that warship is still seen as state property.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.380
These court cases have the potential to doom treasure hunting companies. The Columbus America

10:24.380 --> 10:29.420
Discovery Group of Ohio, after all, no longer hunts for sunken ships, nor does Tommy Thompson,

10:29.420 --> 10:34.660
who's currently in jail. Yet, the industry still exists, there's simply too much potential,

10:34.660 --> 10:39.680
but it's been forced to pivot, either collaborating with governments, or going behind their back

10:39.680 --> 10:45.240
entirely. This messiness is all why, in the marketplace for found treasures, the more

10:45.240 --> 10:50.340
confident the ownership, the higher an item's value. This also explains why the dinosaur

10:50.340 --> 10:56.460
fossil industry has a rather specific geographic concentration. China, Mongolia, Argentina,

10:56.460 --> 11:01.260
and the United States all have some of the world's best fossils, but only the US has

11:01.260 --> 11:06.440
a flourishing industry. That's because, rather uniquely, the US both deems fossils

11:06.440 --> 11:10.300
the property of the owner of the land on which they were found, and allows the owners of

11:10.300 --> 11:15.900
fossils to do whatever they want with them—selling, exporting, anything. That's why, of the

11:15.900 --> 11:20.900
ten most valuable dinosaur fossils ever sold, all came from either Wyoming, South Dakota,

11:20.900 --> 11:26.420
or Montana, and why these three sparsely populated states have become the global epicenter of

11:26.420 --> 11:30.980
this burgeoning industry. And within this region, there is no more influential industry

11:30.980 --> 11:37.140
player than Hill City's Black Hills Institute. That's because, after that fateful day in

11:37.140 --> 11:41.700
1992, they didn't give up. Within weeks of Sue's seizure, the crew packed up their

11:41.700 --> 11:46.260
supplies to head to the site of a triceratops fossil found five years earlier by Institute

11:46.260 --> 11:51.180
paleontologist Stan Sacristone—or so they thought. Upon arrival, they determined the

11:51.180 --> 11:56.100
fossil had been misidentified. It wasn't a triceratops, one of the most commonly found

11:56.100 --> 12:01.380
dinosaur fossils—it was another T. rex, a species whose fossils had been found only

12:01.380 --> 12:06.620
a few dozen times in history. So, they got digging. They didn't find quite as many

12:06.620 --> 12:12.400
bones as with Sue, only 190 compared to 250, but they were in fantastic condition, and

12:12.400 --> 12:17.420
better yet, this time they were 100% sure the property was private and the paperwork

12:17.420 --> 12:23.220
was proper. Stan, as the fossil was dubbed, was absolutely theirs.

12:23.220 --> 12:29.100
Stan essentially replaced Sue. It went on to center the Institute's Hill City Museum,

12:29.100 --> 12:32.860
and while they remained committed to keeping the fossil in their hometown, the Institute,

12:32.860 --> 12:37.500
a for-profit venture, was still able to capitalize on its discovery since, when one discovers

12:37.500 --> 12:42.500
a fossil, one gains ownership of its intellectual property. That's to say, the Black Hills

12:42.500 --> 12:45.780
Institute owns the shape of Stan.

12:45.780 --> 12:50.100
Considering how rare real T. rex fossils are, the vast majority seen in museums are actually

12:50.100 --> 12:54.900
replica casts. In the case of Houston's Museum of Natural Science, DC's National

12:54.900 --> 12:59.180
Museum of Natural History, Tokyo's National Museum of Natural Sciences, dozens of other

12:59.180 --> 13:04.740
institutions and even Disney World, the casts they display are actually of Stan, and still

13:04.740 --> 13:10.700
today, new replicas are being made and sold by the Institute for $150,000.

13:10.700 --> 13:15.320
But Stan would only stay home in Hill City for so long. You see, Black Hills Institute

13:15.360 --> 13:21.240
was majority-owned by Peter Larson, but his younger brother, Neil, owned a minority 35%

13:21.240 --> 13:26.360
stake. In 2012, Peter forced Neil out of the business as their personal relationship fractured,

13:26.360 --> 13:30.640
yet because of their common ownership in the business, this familial dispute spiraled into

13:30.640 --> 13:35.460
a high-profile lawsuit. The court sided with Neil, agreeing that his shareholder rights

13:35.460 --> 13:39.560
had been violated when he was forced out without proper process, and so they agreed that the

13:39.560 --> 13:43.040
business would have to buy his share back from him. But the business didn't have enough

13:43.040 --> 13:47.200
cash on hand to pay for the fair value of these shares, so instead, they agreed that

13:47.200 --> 13:52.680
Neil would get Stan, estimated at around $6-8 million in value, while Peter would get the

13:52.680 --> 13:56.080
entire rest of the Institute and its assets.

13:56.080 --> 14:00.080
Stan was next seen at Christie's New York City showroom where, along with Monet's

14:00.080 --> 14:05.420
and Van Gogh's and Picasso's, it was put up for auction on October 7th, 2020. With

14:05.420 --> 14:09.800
each additional minute of bidding, the price shot skyward, far past this estimate, and

14:09.800 --> 14:16.060
the world of paleontology looked on in simultaneous fascination, delight, and horror.

14:16.060 --> 14:20.000
Upon the strike of the gavel, Sue was sold to the Abu Dhabi Natural History Museum for

14:20.000 --> 14:28.820
$31,847,500, an inconceivable new record for the sale of a dinosaur fossil. Commercial

14:28.820 --> 14:34.000
fossil hunting, as an industry, was a-lit in the 90s when Sue demonstrated its profit

14:34.000 --> 14:39.700
potential, then Stan came along and poured gasoline on that fire. The entire world now

14:39.700 --> 14:46.320
knows that sitting just under the South Dakotan soil are life-defining riches. Today, every

14:46.320 --> 14:50.480
rancher in the state is just waiting for the day when a fossil-hunting crew comes knocking,

14:50.480 --> 14:56.420
ready to strike a deal to hopefully find the next record-breaking Tyrannosaurus rex.

14:56.420 --> 15:02.160
At sea, the potential gains rise even higher, into the hundreds of millions, even into the

15:02.160 --> 15:07.780
billions. So too does the risk, as a shipwreck search costs a lot more than a pair of hiking

15:07.780 --> 15:12.200
boots and a lunch. With a heightened risk and heightened reward, shipwreck hunters need

15:12.200 --> 15:17.760
to be even more confident in who, if anything, actually has a claim to ownership. To establish

15:17.760 --> 15:22.720
this confidence, rather than fighting countries, they've decided to team up and take on contract

15:22.720 --> 15:26.440
work. In the midst of the multi-year legal battle with the Spanish government over the

15:26.440 --> 15:30.680
treasure it found off the coast of Portugal, Odyssey Marine Explorations began work on

15:30.680 --> 15:36.040
another project in the Atlantic—the hunt for the SS Gersopa. Torpedoed by a German

15:36.040 --> 15:40.620
U-boat in World War II, the Gersopa was known to be somewhere off the south coast of Ireland,

15:40.620 --> 15:45.900
carrying some $200 million worth of silver ingots and lying somewhere very deep. A navy

15:45.900 --> 15:50.140
service ship, and one that'd require months of background research, then weeks of exploration,

15:50.140 --> 15:55.420
then a high-stakes salvage process at incredible depths, the SS Gersopa would normally represent

15:55.420 --> 16:00.460
a stay-away proposition. That was until the United Kingdom Department of Transport opened

16:00.460 --> 16:04.940
a competitive tender process for an exclusive salvage contract of the ship.

16:04.940 --> 16:09.040
In 2010, when Odyssey and the UK government had struck a deal that gave the company rights

16:09.040 --> 16:15.240
to 80% of treasure it dredged up, the Odyssey eagerly got to work. After months of research,

16:15.240 --> 16:20.160
the project began with, first, finding the ship. In July of 2011, the Odyssey team took

16:20.160 --> 16:25.400
off aboard a chartered research vessel, pulling behind it a deep-toe, low-frequency sonar

16:25.400 --> 16:32.360
system. Not long after, 300 miles or 480 kilometers off Ireland's coast and 15,000 feet or 4,700

16:32.380 --> 16:36.540
kilometers below the surface, they stumbled across an anomaly shaped an awful lot like

16:36.540 --> 16:42.300
a ship—an exciting moment, but still just the start. Using their own remote-operated

16:42.300 --> 16:46.300
vehicle, the Odyssey Explorer, the team submerged its cameras three hours below the surface

16:46.300 --> 16:51.460
to identify the ship. With positive identification, the project entered the recovery phase, which

16:51.460 --> 16:56.860
required a new boat. Now chartering the highly advanced seabed worker, the Odyssey team,

16:56.860 --> 17:01.380
buoyed by a host of on-site specialty staff, began the process of getting the silver out,

17:01.400 --> 17:07.280
and quickly, as running the seabed worker costs about $100,000 every day. ROVs equipped

17:07.280 --> 17:10.960
with deep-water cutting tools operated from the boat managed to eventually access the

17:10.960 --> 17:15.700
cargo holds, and exactly one year after the project had begun, the first few ingots came

17:15.700 --> 17:20.800
to the surface. In the two years that followed, Odyssey recovered 110 tons of silver, the

17:20.800 --> 17:25.280
UK government got its cut, historians gained access to a trove of long-lost letters that

17:25.280 --> 17:29.080
the ship happened to be carrying, and the press reveled in what was at the time the

17:29.080 --> 17:34.980
heaviest, deepest salvage effort yet accomplished. It was a massive success, an undeniably bold

17:34.980 --> 17:39.100
project that the company could in part justify because it had the confidence of being backed

17:39.100 --> 17:43.060
by the government to own the ship, rather than facing the risk of seeing that same party

17:43.060 --> 17:48.660
in court. Such deals are becoming more common. Since 2015, Colombia has been working on what

17:48.660 --> 17:53.300
exactly it plans to do with the wreck of the San Jose, a Spanish ship sunk by British warships

17:53.300 --> 17:57.020
off the coast of Colombia that was carrying what's been estimated at an unbelievable

17:57.020 --> 18:01.820
20 billion dollars' worth of gold, silver, and precious stones. Lacking the expertise

18:01.820 --> 18:05.760
to pull the treasure up themselves without entirely destroying the archaeological site,

18:05.760 --> 18:10.080
the country has begun the process of figuring out who to work with. Of course, with a treasure

18:10.080 --> 18:14.680
that massive, it remains to be seen what happens, as both Spain and Central American countries

18:14.680 --> 18:19.320
from which these treasures were mined both have made claims on the haul. But more broadly,

18:19.320 --> 18:23.500
a trend towards governments opting to do business with marine salvage and exploration companies

18:23.500 --> 18:27.840
offers the maritime treasure hunting industry an air of legitimacy and a sense of confidence

18:27.840 --> 18:32.800
that should it come up with a bounty, it won't be immediately seized or contested in court.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.460
But while available technology and newfound collaboration have ushered in a golden age

18:36.460 --> 18:41.980
of treasure hunting, the industry is hardly held in high regard by all. The loudest opposition

18:41.980 --> 18:46.820
has come from the halls of academia and heritage-minded institutions like UNESCO who have fought hard

18:46.820 --> 18:51.440
to leave shipwrecks as they lie rather than ruining them for financial gain. To these

18:51.440 --> 18:55.260
groups, these ships provide more by being left alone as they offer important fragments

18:55.260 --> 18:59.580
of the past for researchers while also providing a modicum of respect for those who found these

18:59.580 --> 19:03.940
shipwrecks to be their last resting spots. Somewhere, there's a middle ground, where

19:03.940 --> 19:07.620
technology allows for profitable and safe removal, which can then go on to fund future

19:07.620 --> 19:11.540
research and preservation of such sites without destroying them themselves, but with so many

19:11.540 --> 19:16.280
disparate parties involved, finding such a middle ground seems far off.

19:16.280 --> 19:20.880
A similar story is playing out in the paleontological world. With the sale of Stan and the subsequent

19:20.900 --> 19:25.500
explosion in the fossil industry, there's a fierce debate going on over the ethics of

19:25.500 --> 19:30.680
fossil hunting. On one side you have commercial crews like that from the Black Hills Institute.

19:30.680 --> 19:35.140
They argue that there are plenty of fossils, and just not enough people looking for them.

19:35.140 --> 19:39.580
Fossils sit across all depths, but they're almost always discovered at the surface. That's

19:39.580 --> 19:43.940
because people only notice them when land erodes away to bring the bones to light, but

19:43.940 --> 19:48.940
when it does, after millions upon millions of years of subsurface preservation, the fossil

19:48.960 --> 19:53.820
is placed in peril. Exposure to the elements immediately starts damaging and degrading

19:53.820 --> 20:00.000
the bones, so, if not excavated and cleaned, they'll be lost forever. Therefore, commercial

20:00.000 --> 20:04.280
fossil hunters argue that sales motivate more people to look, which leads to more fossils

20:04.280 --> 20:08.900
found and therefore saved. The academic side disagrees.

20:08.900 --> 20:13.760
Plenty of paleontologists argue that the commercialization of fossils is leading to their loss, at least

20:13.760 --> 20:18.520
to science. That's because landowners are now incentivized against allowing researchers

20:19.100 --> 20:22.420
to do their work on their land—they'd rather wait for the commercial crews to come

20:22.420 --> 20:27.700
and pay them for their bones. Therefore, the for-profit hunters get first dibs, and once

20:27.700 --> 20:33.040
they excavate a fossil, there are no guarantees that it will be available for research. Sotheby's

20:33.040 --> 20:36.980
or Christie's or other auction houses simply sell to the highest bidder, and the buyer

20:36.980 --> 20:42.300
is under absolutely no obligation to make a fossil available to the academic community.

20:42.300 --> 20:47.700
In practice most of the major sales have gone to museums, but theoretically, the next groundbreaking

20:47.700 --> 20:52.420
paleontological discovery could end up in a billionaire's vacation home, entirely

20:52.420 --> 20:56.560
unavailable to those that can do anything more than look at it.

20:56.560 --> 21:00.840
Driven by new technology, new interest, and record-breaking sales, the treasure hunting

21:00.840 --> 21:06.640
industry is in a renaissance—the artifacts of old are as relevant as ever. And as records

21:06.640 --> 21:11.000
continue to break, the drama surrounding these treasures will only mount as the question

21:11.000 --> 21:17.280
of who owns what becomes of higher stakes and higher value.

21:17.280 --> 21:22.660
Even unexpectedly, there is a weird connection between the fields of paleontology and statistics.

21:22.660 --> 21:27.460
That's because paleontology is all about using rare fossils to make big conclusions

21:27.460 --> 21:31.660
about the past. That's also pretty much what statistics is about—the field uses

21:31.660 --> 21:36.620
math to analyze limited data in order to make conclusions, and so by quantifying fossil-related

21:36.620 --> 21:41.500
data, statistical paleontologists are able to study the past. This ability to turn limited

21:41.500 --> 21:46.680
data into useful conclusions is exactly why I find statistics so fascinating, and why

21:46.680 --> 21:50.660
it was one of my favorite courses I took with our sponsor, Brilliant.

21:50.660 --> 21:54.780
