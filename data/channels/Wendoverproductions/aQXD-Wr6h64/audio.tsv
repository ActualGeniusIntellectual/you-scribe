0	6280	At base, every military has defensive capabilities—they're able to protect their homeland from foreign
6280	7280	threats.
7280	12040	Iceland's armed forces, for example, comprise four ships, one airplane, three helicopters,
12040	16000	and four radar stations—all operated by the country's coast guard.
16000	20160	Beyond a small paramilitary peacekeeping unit made up of volunteers, the nation has nearly
20160	25580	no capabilities to deploy abroad—in fact, its constitution doesn't even have a mechanism
25580	27520	to declare war.
27520	32940	Some militaries build on their defensive capabilities with limited expeditionary posturing—ability
32940	35880	to wage a small-scale operation abroad.
35880	39840	This requires an expensive mix of training, equipment, and planning.
39840	44560	Whereas domestic capabilities can be permanent and stationary, all expeditionary capabilities
44560	48040	inherently must be designed to be temporary and mobile.
48040	52000	This spans from the ability to fire a missile to the ability to cook up breakfasts, which
52000	55240	raises costs and complexity dramatically.
55240	60320	For this reason, large-scale expeditionary capabilities are largely confined to the largest,
60320	64640	best-funded militaries like those of France, Mexico, or Canada.
64640	70160	But then there's the US military—it is in a class of its own.
70160	75100	Whereas most nations can defend at home and some can deploy abroad, the US military has
75100	80760	a rather singular strategic posture—they have essentially turned the entire world into
80760	82280	home turf.
82280	86840	Their goal is complete—it's the ability to fight any sort of fight, in any location,
86840	88600	at any moment.
88600	92940	To an American that might sound like the inherent function of a military, but it's a uniquely
92940	98160	US approach—most militaries are merely designed to respond to relevant regional threats and
98160	101280	can scale up to wage a war abroad if necessary.
101280	106320	To be able to fulfill this all-encompassing mission, the US military has a degree of flexibility
106320	111400	and globality unmatched by any other, which incurs a near endless array of exceptional
111400	113400	costs for the force.
113400	116920	They pay to produce their own private label of chicken tenderloins and ship it all around
116920	121040	the world to places like this base in southeastern Turkey because they run a grocery store there
121040	124240	because they have thousands of service members stationed there because that's where they
124240	128500	keep about 50 nuclear warheads in case they decide to use one in Europe, Africa, the Middle
128500	130160	East, or elsewhere.
130160	133980	They pay for professional sports teams to incorporate patriotic ceremonies honoring
133980	137560	past and present service members into their games in order to help boost recruiting to
137560	140660	the level needed to staff all their roles worldwide.
140660	144540	They pay to develop an occasionally viral bipedal humanoid robot because they believe
144540	148520	that in the future they can gain a competitive advantage against other forces by having these
148520	153660	robots integrate into their ranks and fulfill the most dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks.
153660	158720	These costs grow and grow atop each other, and then span all around the world.
158720	162420	From a spatial and logistical standpoint, covering the globe is nothing less than a
162420	165540	monumentally challenging and expensive task.
165540	170300	Then, there's the temporal component—making sure that the right soldiers with the right
170300	175420	weapons and technology are in the right locations requires a predictive approach and proactive
175420	180020	planning, and predicting what future warfare looks like, then preparing for it, is also
180020	182100	an extremely expensive endeavor.
182100	189340	Take, for example, the USS Freedom, a first-of-its-kind littoral combat ship commissioned in 2008.
189340	194280	At just under 400 feet or 120 meters long, what this ship lacks in size, it more than
194280	198180	makes up for in design complexity and state-of-the-art technology.
198180	203580	This ship represents two entire decades of planning and predicting, researching and developing,
203580	208480	contracting and commissioning—a nearly inconceivable dedication of time and resources, but one
208480	212420	that begins to make sense when considering the expectations.
212420	216880	When conceived of in the 1990s, the littoral combat ship was meant to lead the American
216880	219440	Navy for the next half-century.
219440	223860	With the Cold War coming to a close, the US Navy had found itself over-indexed in warships
223860	226820	designed to patrol and battle on the high seas.
226960	231160	Suddenly without a comparable rival, the US was the world's single naval superpower,
231160	234360	and its fleet needed to reflect this new order.
234360	239360	Now the new preeminent war was pirates, terrorists, and gunrunners zipping along coasts, requiring
239360	243700	something nimble, fast, and flexible enough to keep pace in the in-between—the coastal
243700	248380	waters, where threats were diverse and warfare often asymmetrical.
248380	254240	To fill the void, Navy officials presented two ideas—the DD-21, a larger ship capable
254240	259060	of holding its own on tight coastal waters, or what planners called the Street Fighter—a
259060	263180	smaller, sleeker, and critically cheaper option.
263180	266620	From the jump, these Street Fighters were more appealing—they'd require smaller
266620	271180	crews, they'd be fast, capable of surprising enemies, they'd be stealthy, and with the
271180	275660	advent of new hull technology, they'd be light enough to push 45 knots while still
275660	279020	having ocean-wide range and carrying a payload.
279020	283140	If that wasn't enough to future-proof such a concept, they'd be modular too, capable
283140	287180	of switching weapons systems and kits to fit different missions, from surface combat
287180	288780	to minesweeping.
288780	293980	But still, by 2000, such a Street Fighter was just a concept—a concept that the Navy
293980	298240	quickly turned over to private contractors after it proved too difficult to actualize
298240	299240	in-house.
299240	303400	Entering agreements with both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to each produce two ships
303400	307520	in two separate models, the Navy handed the project off to the private sector, assuming
307520	311980	the competition between the two for future LCS contracts would produce a 21st century
311980	312980	mainstay.
312980	316700	While the daunting scope had begun to add to the price tag, the Navy hoped these ships
316700	322360	could come in relatively cheap by shipbuilding standards—somewhere between $150 to $225
322360	323700	million per unit.
323700	329960	By 2009, the US had two ships—one from each contractor, but not four, as budget overrun
329960	334240	on both models was so extreme that the Navy cancelled the contracts for the second of
334240	335240	each.
335240	339360	What was supposed to be in the $200 million at most had ballooned to about double the
339360	340360	price.
340360	346200	The issue was, however, the LCS remained a critical cog in the planned new-age Navy fleet,
346200	355060	and they needed to buy a lot more than two—56 of them, in fact, or 82, or 63, or 55, or
355060	359740	most recently 52, depending on their evolving ship-force structure projections.
359740	364660	But no matter how many, they needed a lot, and needed them fast, as LCSs were expected
364700	367900	to replace old minesweepers and outdated frigates.
367900	371740	And rather than settling on a single class of LCSs previously planned to incentivize
371740	376900	competition, they proposed Congress an alternative—what they called a dual-award strategy, offering
376900	380820	each company a 10-ship contract over the next five years.
380820	385780	All the while, the problems with the Navy's current LCSs were already beginning to show.
385780	390180	As a general rule in shipbuilding, a ship can have range, it can have speed, and it
390180	394260	can have a heavy payload, but it can't have all three at once.
394260	399180	With speed as a principal mandate, both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin had to get creative
399180	400820	and make sacrifices.
400820	405940	While both classes are able to reach an incredible 44 knots—some 10-15 more than a typical
405940	408980	Navy ship—they made separate design choices to get there.
408980	413100	For the Independence class, this meant a unique aluminum trimaran hull.
413100	417420	As for the Freedom class, while Lockheed Martin went with a more conventional steel monohull,
417420	421620	it innovated on the drivetrain side, developing a complicated combining gear that connected
421620	424960	the ship's diesel engines with its gas turbines.
424960	428860	Both designs were innovative, but both had problems.
428860	433180	Aluminum hulls, it turns out, are brittle, and at speeds of higher than just 15 knots
433180	436700	or on rough seas, they may well crack.
436700	440380	As for the combining gear, well, they were hard to keep running, as the components were
440380	444380	buried so deep in the ship that maintenance staff could hardly reach them, and when they
444380	448840	broke down, as they did early and often, they were so complicated that Navy personnel had
448840	453820	to wait around for Lockheed engineers to diagnose the problem and come up with a solution.
453820	456640	Then there was the issue of survivability.
456640	461320	Built as a combat ship, the LCS was intended to reach Level 1 survivability—the ability
461320	465000	to continue operations after an underwater explosive attack.
465000	469800	In 2010, the same year it pushed for the congressional greenlight for 20 more of these ships, the
469800	474760	Navy conceded that the ships already produced hadn't reached Level 1 survivability.
474760	477800	And still, it got worse.
477800	481480	In the rush to get these ships on the water, no time was taken to ensure that all the ship
481480	483560	modules actually worked.
483560	487480	When they did get to testing the modules, it turned out they didn't.
487480	492360	The anti-submarine warfare module proved unreliable because the ship itself is so loud that the
492360	495880	towed sonar can't reliably pick up any other noise.
495880	500360	Similarly, the mine countermeasures mission package, which relies on onboard sensors and
500360	505080	an unmanned influence sweep system, has been plagued with delays, breakdowns, and a penchant
505080	507240	for causing false alarms.
507240	511680	What was supposed to be an endlessly customizable ship, capable for surface combat, submarine
511680	516280	hunting, and minesweeping, has effectively been rendered just a gunship that can't
516280	518260	take a hit.
518260	524440	Regardless of these varying limitations, as of 2023, the US Navy has purchased 30 LCSs.
524440	528840	They've broken down at sea, they've bumped into walls at the Panama Canal, they've
528840	533080	spent a winter stuck in an iced-over St. Lawrence River, they've run a handful of minor missions,
533080	537980	and they've averaged about half a billion per ship to build.
537980	541700	For a ship that was supposed to be the future, the Littoral Combat Ship has proved nothing
541700	547080	short of a disaster—a reality the Navy's finally begun to come to grips with by decommissioning,
547080	550920	or working towards decommissioning, nine of the vessels.
550920	555900	The LCS, by all metrics, has failed to live up to its lofty billing.
555900	558320	And it has failed publicly and expensively.
559200	563320	But it's far from the only decades-long development project that's fallen on its
563320	564320	face.
564320	568300	Boeing-Sikorsky won the contract to build the Comanche helicopter in 1991, but after
568300	573480	a decade of work and $7 billion being poured into the project, only two prototypes ever
573480	575360	actually left the ground.
575360	579820	As for America's first stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, its gun system has yet to prove
579820	583800	the range it's promised, its missile system can't hit targets consistently, and its
583800	588400	guided shells cost a prohibitive $800,000 per unit.
588400	592620	With similarly high hopes as the LCS, the Zumwalt project was eventually cut after only
592620	594680	three ships were built.
594680	601420	Then, most famously, the F-35, the joint strike fighter, adaptable, future-forward, state-of-the-art,
601420	606840	has seen one technical glitch and one busted budget after the next for two whole decades,
606840	611000	its cost ballooning to 89% over what was initially predicted.
611000	616820	And the list goes on with countless other smaller, multi-billion dollar projects.
616820	622300	To a certain extent, such mistakes and miscalculations make sense when working to invent the future
622300	623840	of warfare.
623840	626640	Expensive swings and misses are part of the development process.
626640	632440	But it wasn't always this way, and, increasingly, it seems the swings have gotten bigger and
632440	634200	the misses more frequent.
634200	638680	When the Department of Defense wants a ship or a plane or a weapons system built, there
638680	644040	is a select group of five companies it typically turns to—Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop
644040	646680	Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics.
646680	651160	Excluding Boeing, all these companies earn the majority of their revenue from US or Allied
651160	655360	military contracts, which only happen with the approval of the US.
655360	660520	But even excluding foreign defense revenue, 71% of Lockheed Martin revenue, for example,
660520	662360	comes from the US government.
662360	666840	That translates to $47.5 billion a year.
666840	672340	Put another way, Lockheed Martin is given more by the US government each year than NASA,
672340	674780	a major government agency.
674780	680960	In fact, if the defense contractor was a government agency, it'd be the 24th largest—it gets
680960	685680	more money from the US government than the majority of government agencies.
685680	691240	But unlike agencies, thanks to this business, Lockheed Martin profits nearly a billion dollars
691240	696280	a month, but war wasn't always such a profitable venture.
696880	699800	Technology was what brought the private sector to battle.
699800	704080	Whereas in centuries past militaries were primarily defined by human might, the advent
704080	709320	of airplanes marked perhaps the biggest instance yet of a non-military technology that could
709320	712400	be used to gain a militaristic advantage.
712400	716200	During and after World War I, a number of fledgling aerospace companies gained modest
716200	720260	contracts with the US military, contributing to annual overall production counts in the
720260	722360	dozens or hundreds.
722360	724040	But then came World War II.
724040	729000	Suddenly, the US and its allies needed as many planes as they could get, and with that,
729000	734160	the US government started awarding colossal contracts to anyone who could build an aircraft—Lockheed,
734160	740400	Goodyear, McDonnell, Douglas, Boeing, Hughes, Grumman, Northrop, Vought, Convair, and more.
740400	745080	While all these companies had existed in some form prior, the war was, for all intents and
745080	747000	purposes, what established them.
747000	755000	McDonnell, for example, went from 15 employees to 5,000, Hughes went from 4 to 80,000.
755000	759120	As a sum, whereas in the six years leading up to the war, the US built a mere 20,000
759120	766440	aircraft, during it, the country's manufacturers produced a massive 300,000.
766440	770520	But then the war ended, and this was bad for business.
770520	773320	Aircraft manufacturers immediately struggled.
773320	777960	Some shifted towards civilian aviation, others refocused on auto manufacturing, others still
777960	781360	consolidated, while the US government searched for contracts that could be used to keep this
781360	786280	new industrial sector, which played no small part in the Allied victory, afloat.
786280	791120	Rather quickly, though, a new conflict emerged—the Cold War.
791120	796120	In its early days, rumors arose that the Soviet Union had produced an inconceivable quantity
796120	798120	of long-range bombers.
798120	802880	As the world had now entered the nuclear age, this massively concerned American media, the
802880	807000	public, and ultimately Congress, it was believed that their newfound enemy could straight-up
807000	809080	eradicate the US.
809080	813440	In response, Eisenhower ordered an immediate ramp-up of American bomber production and
813440	818620	agreed to a Lockheed proposal to develop the U-2 high-altitude surveillance aircraft.
818620	822860	It would fly over the Soviet Union undetected, at least theoretically, and get a definitive
822860	826660	answer to just how formidable their bomber fleet had become.
826660	831600	The answer was not much—it was a mere fraction of what had been speculated, but Lockheed
831600	836000	and other manufacturers had already cashed their checks, so the answer meant little to
836000	837000	them.
837000	840860	A near-identical story emerged just a few years later with missiles.
840860	844840	The Soviets had launched Sputnik, and the Democrats of the era used the event to propagate
844840	849760	a narrative that Eisenhower and his Republican Party were falling behind Soviet technological
849760	850760	development.
850760	855360	John F. Kennedy, in the run-up to the 1960 presidential election, latched on to inflated
855360	859080	estimates of Soviet missile capabilities leaked from the Air Force and started to make the
859080	863720	perceived imbalance a central part of his campaign—he argued that his political foes
863720	867460	were ignoring this threat and the American public believed him.
867460	872120	Even after having received definitive evidence to refute this fact, he continued the rhetoric—it
872120	877440	was just so useful politically, which contributed to an acceleration of US missile development.
877440	882000	This was a much-needed windfall for US aerospace companies given the waning need for high-volume
882000	883520	aircraft development.
883520	888560	It was this very incident, in fact, that precipitated the first use of the phrase military-industrial
888560	894020	complex in Eisenhower's farewell address, where he warned of the phenomena's danger.
894020	897960	The subsequent escalation of the Cold War kept the defense industry alive and kicked
897960	903200	off an era of growth as US military spending started to consistently increase, but then
903200	905240	the wall came down.
905240	911200	With no more Cold War, the DoD warned contractors of massive cutbacks in spending.
911200	915760	This kicked off a feeding frenzy of consolidation and acquisition as the industry prepared to
915760	921240	weather what they believed would be the first sustained period of peace in their existence.
921240	926000	Defense spending did decrease, but only slightly, and only for a moment.
926000	930540	9-11 and the ensuing wars quickly returned the US to the historical trend of near-perpetual
930540	935900	spending build, and today, with these wars largely wrapped up, the new most popular justification
935900	940120	for military spending is growing Chinese military might.
940120	944920	Now, many of these supposed threats may be legitimate, but it's tough to know with
944920	950200	confidence because the defense industry, its lobbyists, and politicians are incredibly
950200	953220	effective at shaping public discourse.
953220	958760	In fact, the vast majority of the top think tanks are funded, at least in part, by defense
958760	960400	contractors.
960400	964760	These same think tanks are what are used by politicians and the media as supposedly expert
964760	968440	justification for funding to counter new emerging threats.
968440	972820	Ignoring, for the moment, the more unknowable question of whether warmongering for the sake
972820	978140	of defense industry profits is effective in practice, it's undeniable that the incentive
978140	980260	structures are certainly there.
980260	985260	But perhaps the best evidence for this phenomena's influence is the fact that, inflation-adjusted,
985260	991620	today's military spending is approaching World War II levels despite no active US involvement
991620	994420	in any major conflicts.
994420	998620	Of course, one can still debate whether this level of spending is justified by the present
998620	1004520	geopolitical landscape, but what's undeniable is that taxpayers are getting less and less
1004520	1005660	for their money.
1005660	1010500	There was a time when defense spending had undeniably massive downstream effects.
1010500	1015340	The US military was a major financial force behind the development of world-changing innovations
1015340	1018660	like nuclear technology, GPS, and the internet.
1018660	1024420	In fact, in the 1960s, a full third of the entire world's research and development
1024420	1028580	funding came from US defense-related spending.
1028580	1033900	But today, that share has shrunk to a mere 3%, and what was once perhaps the most innovative
1033900	1037900	force in the world has become downright bad at it.
1037900	1043000	The US auto industry, for example, has quickened its pace of development—it now gets a car
1043000	1044700	to market faster.
1044700	1049780	The US commercial aircraft industry has trended slightly slower, yet in the realm of military
1049780	1052540	aircraft, something dramatic has occurred.
1052540	1059340	What used to take three or five or seven years now stretches into decades.
1059340	1063320	A key part of the problem is that the government has taken the inefficiencies of the public
1063320	1068380	sector and pushed them into the private sector, where they can be profited upon.
1068380	1075220	When developing a new generation of aircraft or ship or anything, the DoD sets strict parameters.
1075220	1079800	That flips traditional incentive structures—most industries see the private sector innovate
1079800	1083440	in order to create new products that their customers will want.
1083440	1087960	In this case, the customer tells the private sector exactly what they want, and this industry
1087960	1092840	spends heavily on lobbyists, many of whom used to work for the DoD, in order to shape
1092840	1097340	contracts towards what they can build with minimal risky research and development, therefore
1097340	1099280	stifling innovation.
1099280	1104400	But even then, the risk for the contractor is mitigated further because a big chunk of
1104400	1107680	contracts are awarded on a cost-plus basis.
1107680	1112640	That's to say, the government pays for what it costs to build a given technology,
1112640	1117160	then the contractor gets a percentage on top of that, as profit.
1117160	1123460	This directly disincentivizes cost efficiency, as the more a project costs, the more the
1123460	1125380	contractor makes.
1125380	1129520	Of course, in normal industries the contractor would still be incentivized towards efficiency
1129520	1134120	in order to win the next contract, but in this industry, two-thirds of major weapon
1134120	1139280	system contracts, for example, are bid upon by just one company, while yet more contracts
1139280	1142920	are awarded without a competitive bidding process.
1142920	1148380	Perhaps most egregiously, it's well understood that some contracts are awarded to struggling,
1148380	1152880	ineffective companies simply because the US government does not want that company to go
1152880	1158840	bankrupt and therefore for its manufacturing capabilities to be lost.
1158840	1163640	This is perhaps one of the strongest justifications for the spending—the US military cannot
1163640	1168880	afford for Lockheed or Boeing or Raytheon or the other contractors to go bankrupt because
1168880	1174020	they are the only companies in the world capable of producing the technologies that bestow
1174020	1177560	the fighting force with such a technological advantage.
1177560	1182800	So, a situation has been crafted where these companies are too important to fail, and they
1182800	1189160	know that, so they can profit off of their necessity rather than their effectiveness.
1189160	1193720	The aforementioned only scratches the surface of the deep web of incentives that keeps the
1193720	1199040	military-industrial complex alive, but at its core, it's as simple as this—it is
1199040	1203880	good for politicians politically, and good for contractors economically, to create the
1203880	1208340	perception of problems that simply do not exist.
1208340	1212780	No one gets punished when a threat does not materialize—in fact, they can argue that
1212780	1218520	their response, upon which they profited politically or economically, mitigated the threat.
1218520	1224120	Meanwhile, individuals are punished when a threat they argued did not exist materializes,
1224120	1227020	disincentivizing anyone from doing so.
1227020	1233320	Fear is an incredibly powerful emotion, and, at its core, the military-industrial complex
1233320	1240640	has created an incredibly effective system to capitalize upon it.
1240640	1244440	As you might have noticed, the last Wendover video is no longer on YouTube.
1244860	1249160	It's a somewhat long and frustrating story, but to summarize, there was a quick clip in
1249160	1252680	it where you could see some personal info on a passport.
1252680	1256560	YouTube's harassment and cyberbullying policy includes a provision against sharing personally
1256560	1260720	identifiable information such as this, and even though it was clearly unintentional,
1260720	1265020	the video was taken down as a policy strike, which seems fair given the wording of this
1265020	1266020	policy.
1266020	1269300	Unfortunately, unlike with most privacy issues on YouTube videos, because this was taken
1269300	1274220	down as a policy strike, there is no ability for us to rectify the issue even though it
1274220	1278820	could be done with a quick blur, so the video is down permanently, at least on YouTube.
1278820	1282280	You see, a couple years ago, some creator friends and I got together to try to both
1282280	1285980	build on the best parts of YouTube and rectify some of its issues.
1285980	1291000	We called it Nebula, and it's gone fantastically, with over half a million subscribers, hundreds
1291000	1295500	of thousands of monthly active users, Streamy Award nominations, and more, but one small
1295500	1299700	way we improved from YouTube was by adding this—a little button on our backend that
1299700	1304360	allows the creator to swap files on a video to correct mistakes, make improvements, or,
1304360	1309060	in this case, blur that passport, so the video's still up on Nebula.
1309060	1313700	But we also designed the platform with a unique business model that allows us to fund higher-budget,
1313700	1317660	exclusive content, so another video that's up on Nebula is the latest episode of the
1317660	1320400	Logistics of X about arms manufacturing.
1320400	1324100	It builds on this video's topic to show the nitty-gritty of how the US military and
1324100	1328340	its industry partners manufacture and distribute the physical weapons of war without those
1328340	1330740	weapons endangering anyone along the way.
1330740	1334180	Clearly you made it to the end of this video, so I know you'll enjoy that one, as it was
1334180	1337660	written from the beginning to appeal to those that enjoyed this video.
1337660	1341260	We have a huge slate of originals incoming over the next couple months, plenty of which
1341260	1345400	I'm sure you'll want to watch, then, in addition to the Logistics of X, we have perhaps
1345400	1350140	the most ambitious, highest-budget Wendover original to date in pre-production right now.
1350140	1353900	And if all that's not convincing enough already, it's worth mentioning that we designed
1353900	1358360	Nebula to really be worthwhile not only to you, the viewer, but also to the creators.
1358360	1361520	When you sign up at our link, we'll get a portion of your subscription revenue for
1361520	1365580	as long as you stay subscribed, which gives us stable, predictable monthly revenue that
1365580	1369740	we can rely on for growth, unlike with the ebbs and flows of ad rates.
1369740	1374020	So, if you'd like to get access to Nebula's huge catalog of original content and help
1374020	1378280	support the channel, just click the button on screen or head to Nebula.tv slash Wendover,
1378280	1382580	and when you do, you'll get 40% off an annual plan, which brings the cost down to under
1382580	1384100	$3 a month.
