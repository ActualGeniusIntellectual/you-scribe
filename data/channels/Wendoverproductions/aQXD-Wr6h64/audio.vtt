00:00.000 --> 00:06.280
At base, every military has defensive capabilities—they're able to protect their homeland from foreign

00:06.280 --> 00:07.280
threats.

00:07.280 --> 00:12.040
Iceland's armed forces, for example, comprise four ships, one airplane, three helicopters,

00:12.040 --> 00:16.000
and four radar stations—all operated by the country's coast guard.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.160
Beyond a small paramilitary peacekeeping unit made up of volunteers, the nation has nearly

00:20.160 --> 00:25.580
no capabilities to deploy abroad—in fact, its constitution doesn't even have a mechanism

00:25.580 --> 00:27.520
to declare war.

00:27.520 --> 00:32.940
Some militaries build on their defensive capabilities with limited expeditionary posturing—ability

00:32.940 --> 00:35.880
to wage a small-scale operation abroad.

00:35.880 --> 00:39.840
This requires an expensive mix of training, equipment, and planning.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.560
Whereas domestic capabilities can be permanent and stationary, all expeditionary capabilities

00:44.560 --> 00:48.040
inherently must be designed to be temporary and mobile.

00:48.040 --> 00:52.000
This spans from the ability to fire a missile to the ability to cook up breakfasts, which

00:52.000 --> 00:55.240
raises costs and complexity dramatically.

00:55.240 --> 01:00.320
For this reason, large-scale expeditionary capabilities are largely confined to the largest,

01:00.320 --> 01:04.640
best-funded militaries like those of France, Mexico, or Canada.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.160
But then there's the US military—it is in a class of its own.

01:10.160 --> 01:15.100
Whereas most nations can defend at home and some can deploy abroad, the US military has

01:15.100 --> 01:20.760
a rather singular strategic posture—they have essentially turned the entire world into

01:20.760 --> 01:22.280
home turf.

01:22.280 --> 01:26.840
Their goal is complete—it's the ability to fight any sort of fight, in any location,

01:26.840 --> 01:28.600
at any moment.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.940
To an American that might sound like the inherent function of a military, but it's a uniquely

01:32.940 --> 01:38.160
US approach—most militaries are merely designed to respond to relevant regional threats and

01:38.160 --> 01:41.280
can scale up to wage a war abroad if necessary.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.320
To be able to fulfill this all-encompassing mission, the US military has a degree of flexibility

01:46.320 --> 01:51.400
and globality unmatched by any other, which incurs a near endless array of exceptional

01:51.400 --> 01:53.400
costs for the force.

01:53.400 --> 01:56.920
They pay to produce their own private label of chicken tenderloins and ship it all around

01:56.920 --> 02:01.040
the world to places like this base in southeastern Turkey because they run a grocery store there

02:01.040 --> 02:04.240
because they have thousands of service members stationed there because that's where they

02:04.240 --> 02:08.500
keep about 50 nuclear warheads in case they decide to use one in Europe, Africa, the Middle

02:08.500 --> 02:10.160
East, or elsewhere.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.980
They pay for professional sports teams to incorporate patriotic ceremonies honoring

02:13.980 --> 02:17.560
past and present service members into their games in order to help boost recruiting to

02:17.560 --> 02:20.660
the level needed to staff all their roles worldwide.

02:20.660 --> 02:24.540
They pay to develop an occasionally viral bipedal humanoid robot because they believe

02:24.540 --> 02:28.520
that in the future they can gain a competitive advantage against other forces by having these

02:28.520 --> 02:33.660
robots integrate into their ranks and fulfill the most dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks.

02:33.660 --> 02:38.720
These costs grow and grow atop each other, and then span all around the world.

02:38.720 --> 02:42.420
From a spatial and logistical standpoint, covering the globe is nothing less than a

02:42.420 --> 02:45.540
monumentally challenging and expensive task.

02:45.540 --> 02:50.300
Then, there's the temporal component—making sure that the right soldiers with the right

02:50.300 --> 02:55.420
weapons and technology are in the right locations requires a predictive approach and proactive

02:55.420 --> 03:00.020
planning, and predicting what future warfare looks like, then preparing for it, is also

03:00.020 --> 03:02.100
an extremely expensive endeavor.

03:02.100 --> 03:09.340
Take, for example, the USS Freedom, a first-of-its-kind littoral combat ship commissioned in 2008.

03:09.340 --> 03:14.280
At just under 400 feet or 120 meters long, what this ship lacks in size, it more than

03:14.280 --> 03:18.180
makes up for in design complexity and state-of-the-art technology.

03:18.180 --> 03:23.580
This ship represents two entire decades of planning and predicting, researching and developing,

03:23.580 --> 03:28.480
contracting and commissioning—a nearly inconceivable dedication of time and resources, but one

03:28.480 --> 03:32.420
that begins to make sense when considering the expectations.

03:32.420 --> 03:36.880
When conceived of in the 1990s, the littoral combat ship was meant to lead the American

03:36.880 --> 03:39.440
Navy for the next half-century.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.860
With the Cold War coming to a close, the US Navy had found itself over-indexed in warships

03:43.860 --> 03:46.820
designed to patrol and battle on the high seas.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.160
Suddenly without a comparable rival, the US was the world's single naval superpower,

03:51.160 --> 03:54.360
and its fleet needed to reflect this new order.

03:54.360 --> 03:59.360
Now the new preeminent war was pirates, terrorists, and gunrunners zipping along coasts, requiring

03:59.360 --> 04:03.700
something nimble, fast, and flexible enough to keep pace in the in-between—the coastal

04:03.700 --> 04:08.380
waters, where threats were diverse and warfare often asymmetrical.

04:08.380 --> 04:14.240
To fill the void, Navy officials presented two ideas—the DD-21, a larger ship capable

04:14.240 --> 04:19.060
of holding its own on tight coastal waters, or what planners called the Street Fighter—a

04:19.060 --> 04:23.180
smaller, sleeker, and critically cheaper option.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.620
From the jump, these Street Fighters were more appealing—they'd require smaller

04:26.620 --> 04:31.180
crews, they'd be fast, capable of surprising enemies, they'd be stealthy, and with the

04:31.180 --> 04:35.660
advent of new hull technology, they'd be light enough to push 45 knots while still

04:35.660 --> 04:39.020
having ocean-wide range and carrying a payload.

04:39.020 --> 04:43.140
If that wasn't enough to future-proof such a concept, they'd be modular too, capable

04:43.140 --> 04:47.180
of switching weapons systems and kits to fit different missions, from surface combat

04:47.180 --> 04:48.780
to minesweeping.

04:48.780 --> 04:53.980
But still, by 2000, such a Street Fighter was just a concept—a concept that the Navy

04:53.980 --> 04:58.240
quickly turned over to private contractors after it proved too difficult to actualize

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
in-house.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.400
Entering agreements with both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to each produce two ships

05:03.400 --> 05:07.520
in two separate models, the Navy handed the project off to the private sector, assuming

05:07.520 --> 05:11.980
the competition between the two for future LCS contracts would produce a 21st century

05:11.980 --> 05:12.980
mainstay.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.700
While the daunting scope had begun to add to the price tag, the Navy hoped these ships

05:16.700 --> 05:22.360
could come in relatively cheap by shipbuilding standards—somewhere between $150 to $225

05:22.360 --> 05:23.700
million per unit.

05:23.700 --> 05:29.960
By 2009, the US had two ships—one from each contractor, but not four, as budget overrun

05:29.960 --> 05:34.240
on both models was so extreme that the Navy cancelled the contracts for the second of

05:34.240 --> 05:35.240
each.

05:35.240 --> 05:39.360
What was supposed to be in the $200 million at most had ballooned to about double the

05:39.360 --> 05:40.360
price.

05:40.360 --> 05:46.200
The issue was, however, the LCS remained a critical cog in the planned new-age Navy fleet,

05:46.200 --> 05:55.060
and they needed to buy a lot more than two—56 of them, in fact, or 82, or 63, or 55, or

05:55.060 --> 05:59.740
most recently 52, depending on their evolving ship-force structure projections.

05:59.740 --> 06:04.660
But no matter how many, they needed a lot, and needed them fast, as LCSs were expected

06:04.700 --> 06:07.900
to replace old minesweepers and outdated frigates.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.740
And rather than settling on a single class of LCSs previously planned to incentivize

06:11.740 --> 06:16.900
competition, they proposed Congress an alternative—what they called a dual-award strategy, offering

06:16.900 --> 06:20.820
each company a 10-ship contract over the next five years.

06:20.820 --> 06:25.780
All the while, the problems with the Navy's current LCSs were already beginning to show.

06:25.780 --> 06:30.180
As a general rule in shipbuilding, a ship can have range, it can have speed, and it

06:30.180 --> 06:34.260
can have a heavy payload, but it can't have all three at once.

06:34.260 --> 06:39.180
With speed as a principal mandate, both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin had to get creative

06:39.180 --> 06:40.820
and make sacrifices.

06:40.820 --> 06:45.940
While both classes are able to reach an incredible 44 knots—some 10-15 more than a typical

06:45.940 --> 06:48.980
Navy ship—they made separate design choices to get there.

06:48.980 --> 06:53.100
For the Independence class, this meant a unique aluminum trimaran hull.

06:53.100 --> 06:57.420
As for the Freedom class, while Lockheed Martin went with a more conventional steel monohull,

06:57.420 --> 07:01.620
it innovated on the drivetrain side, developing a complicated combining gear that connected

07:01.620 --> 07:04.960
the ship's diesel engines with its gas turbines.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.860
Both designs were innovative, but both had problems.

07:08.860 --> 07:13.180
Aluminum hulls, it turns out, are brittle, and at speeds of higher than just 15 knots

07:13.180 --> 07:16.700
or on rough seas, they may well crack.

07:16.700 --> 07:20.380
As for the combining gear, well, they were hard to keep running, as the components were

07:20.380 --> 07:24.380
buried so deep in the ship that maintenance staff could hardly reach them, and when they

07:24.380 --> 07:28.840
broke down, as they did early and often, they were so complicated that Navy personnel had

07:28.840 --> 07:33.820
to wait around for Lockheed engineers to diagnose the problem and come up with a solution.

07:33.820 --> 07:36.640
Then there was the issue of survivability.

07:36.640 --> 07:41.320
Built as a combat ship, the LCS was intended to reach Level 1 survivability—the ability

07:41.320 --> 07:45.000
to continue operations after an underwater explosive attack.

07:45.000 --> 07:49.800
In 2010, the same year it pushed for the congressional greenlight for 20 more of these ships, the

07:49.800 --> 07:54.760
Navy conceded that the ships already produced hadn't reached Level 1 survivability.

07:54.760 --> 07:57.800
And still, it got worse.

07:57.800 --> 08:01.480
In the rush to get these ships on the water, no time was taken to ensure that all the ship

08:01.480 --> 08:03.560
modules actually worked.

08:03.560 --> 08:07.480
When they did get to testing the modules, it turned out they didn't.

08:07.480 --> 08:12.360
The anti-submarine warfare module proved unreliable because the ship itself is so loud that the

08:12.360 --> 08:15.880
towed sonar can't reliably pick up any other noise.

08:15.880 --> 08:20.360
Similarly, the mine countermeasures mission package, which relies on onboard sensors and

08:20.360 --> 08:25.080
an unmanned influence sweep system, has been plagued with delays, breakdowns, and a penchant

08:25.080 --> 08:27.240
for causing false alarms.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.680
What was supposed to be an endlessly customizable ship, capable for surface combat, submarine

08:31.680 --> 08:36.280
hunting, and minesweeping, has effectively been rendered just a gunship that can't

08:36.280 --> 08:38.260
take a hit.

08:38.260 --> 08:44.440
Regardless of these varying limitations, as of 2023, the US Navy has purchased 30 LCSs.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.840
They've broken down at sea, they've bumped into walls at the Panama Canal, they've

08:48.840 --> 08:53.080
spent a winter stuck in an iced-over St. Lawrence River, they've run a handful of minor missions,

08:53.080 --> 08:57.980
and they've averaged about half a billion per ship to build.

08:57.980 --> 09:01.700
For a ship that was supposed to be the future, the Littoral Combat Ship has proved nothing

09:01.700 --> 09:07.080
short of a disaster—a reality the Navy's finally begun to come to grips with by decommissioning,

09:07.080 --> 09:10.920
or working towards decommissioning, nine of the vessels.

09:10.920 --> 09:15.900
The LCS, by all metrics, has failed to live up to its lofty billing.

09:15.900 --> 09:18.320
And it has failed publicly and expensively.

09:19.200 --> 09:23.320
But it's far from the only decades-long development project that's fallen on its

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
face.

09:24.320 --> 09:28.300
Boeing-Sikorsky won the contract to build the Comanche helicopter in 1991, but after

09:28.300 --> 09:33.480
a decade of work and $7 billion being poured into the project, only two prototypes ever

09:33.480 --> 09:35.360
actually left the ground.

09:35.360 --> 09:39.820
As for America's first stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, its gun system has yet to prove

09:39.820 --> 09:43.800
the range it's promised, its missile system can't hit targets consistently, and its

09:43.800 --> 09:48.400
guided shells cost a prohibitive $800,000 per unit.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.620
With similarly high hopes as the LCS, the Zumwalt project was eventually cut after only

09:52.620 --> 09:54.680
three ships were built.

09:54.680 --> 10:01.420
Then, most famously, the F-35, the joint strike fighter, adaptable, future-forward, state-of-the-art,

10:01.420 --> 10:06.840
has seen one technical glitch and one busted budget after the next for two whole decades,

10:06.840 --> 10:11.000
its cost ballooning to 89% over what was initially predicted.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.820
And the list goes on with countless other smaller, multi-billion dollar projects.

10:16.820 --> 10:22.300
To a certain extent, such mistakes and miscalculations make sense when working to invent the future

10:22.300 --> 10:23.840
of warfare.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.640
Expensive swings and misses are part of the development process.

10:26.640 --> 10:32.440
But it wasn't always this way, and, increasingly, it seems the swings have gotten bigger and

10:32.440 --> 10:34.200
the misses more frequent.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.680
When the Department of Defense wants a ship or a plane or a weapons system built, there

10:38.680 --> 10:44.040
is a select group of five companies it typically turns to—Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop

10:44.040 --> 10:46.680
Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.160
Excluding Boeing, all these companies earn the majority of their revenue from US or Allied

10:51.160 --> 10:55.360
military contracts, which only happen with the approval of the US.

10:55.360 --> 11:00.520
But even excluding foreign defense revenue, 71% of Lockheed Martin revenue, for example,

11:00.520 --> 11:02.360
comes from the US government.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.840
That translates to $47.5 billion a year.

11:06.840 --> 11:12.340
Put another way, Lockheed Martin is given more by the US government each year than NASA,

11:12.340 --> 11:14.780
a major government agency.

11:14.780 --> 11:20.960
In fact, if the defense contractor was a government agency, it'd be the 24th largest—it gets

11:20.960 --> 11:25.680
more money from the US government than the majority of government agencies.

11:25.680 --> 11:31.240
But unlike agencies, thanks to this business, Lockheed Martin profits nearly a billion dollars

11:31.240 --> 11:36.280
a month, but war wasn't always such a profitable venture.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.800
Technology was what brought the private sector to battle.

11:39.800 --> 11:44.080
Whereas in centuries past militaries were primarily defined by human might, the advent

11:44.080 --> 11:49.320
of airplanes marked perhaps the biggest instance yet of a non-military technology that could

11:49.320 --> 11:52.400
be used to gain a militaristic advantage.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.200
During and after World War I, a number of fledgling aerospace companies gained modest

11:56.200 --> 12:00.260
contracts with the US military, contributing to annual overall production counts in the

12:00.260 --> 12:02.360
dozens or hundreds.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.040
But then came World War II.

12:04.040 --> 12:09.000
Suddenly, the US and its allies needed as many planes as they could get, and with that,

12:09.000 --> 12:14.160
the US government started awarding colossal contracts to anyone who could build an aircraft—Lockheed,

12:14.160 --> 12:20.400
Goodyear, McDonnell, Douglas, Boeing, Hughes, Grumman, Northrop, Vought, Convair, and more.

12:20.400 --> 12:25.080
While all these companies had existed in some form prior, the war was, for all intents and

12:25.080 --> 12:27.000
purposes, what established them.

12:27.000 --> 12:35.000
McDonnell, for example, went from 15 employees to 5,000, Hughes went from 4 to 80,000.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.120
As a sum, whereas in the six years leading up to the war, the US built a mere 20,000

12:39.120 --> 12:46.440
aircraft, during it, the country's manufacturers produced a massive 300,000.

12:46.440 --> 12:50.520
But then the war ended, and this was bad for business.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.320
Aircraft manufacturers immediately struggled.

12:53.320 --> 12:57.960
Some shifted towards civilian aviation, others refocused on auto manufacturing, others still

12:57.960 --> 13:01.360
consolidated, while the US government searched for contracts that could be used to keep this

13:01.360 --> 13:06.280
new industrial sector, which played no small part in the Allied victory, afloat.

13:06.280 --> 13:11.120
Rather quickly, though, a new conflict emerged—the Cold War.

13:11.120 --> 13:16.120
In its early days, rumors arose that the Soviet Union had produced an inconceivable quantity

13:16.120 --> 13:18.120
of long-range bombers.

13:18.120 --> 13:22.880
As the world had now entered the nuclear age, this massively concerned American media, the

13:22.880 --> 13:27.000
public, and ultimately Congress, it was believed that their newfound enemy could straight-up

13:27.000 --> 13:29.080
eradicate the US.

13:29.080 --> 13:33.440
In response, Eisenhower ordered an immediate ramp-up of American bomber production and

13:33.440 --> 13:38.620
agreed to a Lockheed proposal to develop the U-2 high-altitude surveillance aircraft.

13:38.620 --> 13:42.860
It would fly over the Soviet Union undetected, at least theoretically, and get a definitive

13:42.860 --> 13:46.660
answer to just how formidable their bomber fleet had become.

13:46.660 --> 13:51.600
The answer was not much—it was a mere fraction of what had been speculated, but Lockheed

13:51.600 --> 13:56.000
and other manufacturers had already cashed their checks, so the answer meant little to

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
them.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.860
A near-identical story emerged just a few years later with missiles.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.840
The Soviets had launched Sputnik, and the Democrats of the era used the event to propagate

14:04.840 --> 14:09.760
a narrative that Eisenhower and his Republican Party were falling behind Soviet technological

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
development.

14:10.760 --> 14:15.360
John F. Kennedy, in the run-up to the 1960 presidential election, latched on to inflated

14:15.360 --> 14:19.080
estimates of Soviet missile capabilities leaked from the Air Force and started to make the

14:19.080 --> 14:23.720
perceived imbalance a central part of his campaign—he argued that his political foes

14:23.720 --> 14:27.460
were ignoring this threat and the American public believed him.

14:27.460 --> 14:32.120
Even after having received definitive evidence to refute this fact, he continued the rhetoric—it

14:32.120 --> 14:37.440
was just so useful politically, which contributed to an acceleration of US missile development.

14:37.440 --> 14:42.000
This was a much-needed windfall for US aerospace companies given the waning need for high-volume

14:42.000 --> 14:43.520
aircraft development.

14:43.520 --> 14:48.560
It was this very incident, in fact, that precipitated the first use of the phrase military-industrial

14:48.560 --> 14:54.020
complex in Eisenhower's farewell address, where he warned of the phenomena's danger.

14:54.020 --> 14:57.960
The subsequent escalation of the Cold War kept the defense industry alive and kicked

14:57.960 --> 15:03.200
off an era of growth as US military spending started to consistently increase, but then

15:03.200 --> 15:05.240
the wall came down.

15:05.240 --> 15:11.200
With no more Cold War, the DoD warned contractors of massive cutbacks in spending.

15:11.200 --> 15:15.760
This kicked off a feeding frenzy of consolidation and acquisition as the industry prepared to

15:15.760 --> 15:21.240
weather what they believed would be the first sustained period of peace in their existence.

15:21.240 --> 15:26.000
Defense spending did decrease, but only slightly, and only for a moment.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.540
9-11 and the ensuing wars quickly returned the US to the historical trend of near-perpetual

15:30.540 --> 15:35.900
spending build, and today, with these wars largely wrapped up, the new most popular justification

15:35.900 --> 15:40.120
for military spending is growing Chinese military might.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.920
Now, many of these supposed threats may be legitimate, but it's tough to know with

15:44.920 --> 15:50.200
confidence because the defense industry, its lobbyists, and politicians are incredibly

15:50.200 --> 15:53.220
effective at shaping public discourse.

15:53.220 --> 15:58.760
In fact, the vast majority of the top think tanks are funded, at least in part, by defense

15:58.760 --> 16:00.400
contractors.

16:00.400 --> 16:04.760
These same think tanks are what are used by politicians and the media as supposedly expert

16:04.760 --> 16:08.440
justification for funding to counter new emerging threats.

16:08.440 --> 16:12.820
Ignoring, for the moment, the more unknowable question of whether warmongering for the sake

16:12.820 --> 16:18.140
of defense industry profits is effective in practice, it's undeniable that the incentive

16:18.140 --> 16:20.260
structures are certainly there.

16:20.260 --> 16:25.260
But perhaps the best evidence for this phenomena's influence is the fact that, inflation-adjusted,

16:25.260 --> 16:31.620
today's military spending is approaching World War II levels despite no active US involvement

16:31.620 --> 16:34.420
in any major conflicts.

16:34.420 --> 16:38.620
Of course, one can still debate whether this level of spending is justified by the present

16:38.620 --> 16:44.520
geopolitical landscape, but what's undeniable is that taxpayers are getting less and less

16:44.520 --> 16:45.660
for their money.

16:45.660 --> 16:50.500
There was a time when defense spending had undeniably massive downstream effects.

16:50.500 --> 16:55.340
The US military was a major financial force behind the development of world-changing innovations

16:55.340 --> 16:58.660
like nuclear technology, GPS, and the internet.

16:58.660 --> 17:04.420
In fact, in the 1960s, a full third of the entire world's research and development

17:04.420 --> 17:08.580
funding came from US defense-related spending.

17:08.580 --> 17:13.900
But today, that share has shrunk to a mere 3%, and what was once perhaps the most innovative

17:13.900 --> 17:17.900
force in the world has become downright bad at it.

17:17.900 --> 17:23.000
The US auto industry, for example, has quickened its pace of development—it now gets a car

17:23.000 --> 17:24.700
to market faster.

17:24.700 --> 17:29.780
The US commercial aircraft industry has trended slightly slower, yet in the realm of military

17:29.780 --> 17:32.540
aircraft, something dramatic has occurred.

17:32.540 --> 17:39.340
What used to take three or five or seven years now stretches into decades.

17:39.340 --> 17:43.320
A key part of the problem is that the government has taken the inefficiencies of the public

17:43.320 --> 17:48.380
sector and pushed them into the private sector, where they can be profited upon.

17:48.380 --> 17:55.220
When developing a new generation of aircraft or ship or anything, the DoD sets strict parameters.

17:55.220 --> 17:59.800
That flips traditional incentive structures—most industries see the private sector innovate

17:59.800 --> 18:03.440
in order to create new products that their customers will want.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.960
In this case, the customer tells the private sector exactly what they want, and this industry

18:07.960 --> 18:12.840
spends heavily on lobbyists, many of whom used to work for the DoD, in order to shape

18:12.840 --> 18:17.340
contracts towards what they can build with minimal risky research and development, therefore

18:17.340 --> 18:19.280
stifling innovation.

18:19.280 --> 18:24.400
But even then, the risk for the contractor is mitigated further because a big chunk of

18:24.400 --> 18:27.680
contracts are awarded on a cost-plus basis.

18:27.680 --> 18:32.640
That's to say, the government pays for what it costs to build a given technology,

18:32.640 --> 18:37.160
then the contractor gets a percentage on top of that, as profit.

18:37.160 --> 18:43.460
This directly disincentivizes cost efficiency, as the more a project costs, the more the

18:43.460 --> 18:45.380
contractor makes.

18:45.380 --> 18:49.520
Of course, in normal industries the contractor would still be incentivized towards efficiency

18:49.520 --> 18:54.120
in order to win the next contract, but in this industry, two-thirds of major weapon

18:54.120 --> 18:59.280
system contracts, for example, are bid upon by just one company, while yet more contracts

18:59.280 --> 19:02.920
are awarded without a competitive bidding process.

19:02.920 --> 19:08.380
Perhaps most egregiously, it's well understood that some contracts are awarded to struggling,

19:08.380 --> 19:12.880
ineffective companies simply because the US government does not want that company to go

19:12.880 --> 19:18.840
bankrupt and therefore for its manufacturing capabilities to be lost.

19:18.840 --> 19:23.640
This is perhaps one of the strongest justifications for the spending—the US military cannot

19:23.640 --> 19:28.880
afford for Lockheed or Boeing or Raytheon or the other contractors to go bankrupt because

19:28.880 --> 19:34.020
they are the only companies in the world capable of producing the technologies that bestow

19:34.020 --> 19:37.560
the fighting force with such a technological advantage.

19:37.560 --> 19:42.800
So, a situation has been crafted where these companies are too important to fail, and they

19:42.800 --> 19:49.160
know that, so they can profit off of their necessity rather than their effectiveness.

19:49.160 --> 19:53.720
The aforementioned only scratches the surface of the deep web of incentives that keeps the

19:53.720 --> 19:59.040
military-industrial complex alive, but at its core, it's as simple as this—it is

19:59.040 --> 20:03.880
good for politicians politically, and good for contractors economically, to create the

20:03.880 --> 20:08.340
perception of problems that simply do not exist.

20:08.340 --> 20:12.780
No one gets punished when a threat does not materialize—in fact, they can argue that

20:12.780 --> 20:18.520
their response, upon which they profited politically or economically, mitigated the threat.

20:18.520 --> 20:24.120
Meanwhile, individuals are punished when a threat they argued did not exist materializes,

20:24.120 --> 20:27.020
disincentivizing anyone from doing so.

20:27.020 --> 20:33.320
Fear is an incredibly powerful emotion, and, at its core, the military-industrial complex

20:33.320 --> 20:40.640
has created an incredibly effective system to capitalize upon it.

20:40.640 --> 20:44.440
As you might have noticed, the last Wendover video is no longer on YouTube.

20:44.860 --> 20:49.160
It's a somewhat long and frustrating story, but to summarize, there was a quick clip in

20:49.160 --> 20:52.680
it where you could see some personal info on a passport.

20:52.680 --> 20:56.560
YouTube's harassment and cyberbullying policy includes a provision against sharing personally

20:56.560 --> 21:00.720
identifiable information such as this, and even though it was clearly unintentional,

21:00.720 --> 21:05.020
the video was taken down as a policy strike, which seems fair given the wording of this

21:05.020 --> 21:06.020
policy.

21:06.020 --> 21:09.300
Unfortunately, unlike with most privacy issues on YouTube videos, because this was taken

21:09.300 --> 21:14.220
down as a policy strike, there is no ability for us to rectify the issue even though it

21:14.220 --> 21:18.820
could be done with a quick blur, so the video is down permanently, at least on YouTube.

21:18.820 --> 21:22.280
You see, a couple years ago, some creator friends and I got together to try to both

21:22.280 --> 21:25.980
build on the best parts of YouTube and rectify some of its issues.

21:25.980 --> 21:31.000
We called it Nebula, and it's gone fantastically, with over half a million subscribers, hundreds

21:31.000 --> 21:35.500
of thousands of monthly active users, Streamy Award nominations, and more, but one small

21:35.500 --> 21:39.700
way we improved from YouTube was by adding this—a little button on our backend that

21:39.700 --> 21:44.360
allows the creator to swap files on a video to correct mistakes, make improvements, or,

21:44.360 --> 21:49.060
in this case, blur that passport, so the video's still up on Nebula.

21:49.060 --> 21:53.700
But we also designed the platform with a unique business model that allows us to fund higher-budget,

21:53.700 --> 21:57.660
exclusive content, so another video that's up on Nebula is the latest episode of the

21:57.660 --> 22:00.400
Logistics of X about arms manufacturing.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.100
It builds on this video's topic to show the nitty-gritty of how the US military and

22:04.100 --> 22:08.340
its industry partners manufacture and distribute the physical weapons of war without those

22:08.340 --> 22:10.740
weapons endangering anyone along the way.

22:10.740 --> 22:14.180
Clearly you made it to the end of this video, so I know you'll enjoy that one, as it was

22:14.180 --> 22:17.660
written from the beginning to appeal to those that enjoyed this video.

22:17.660 --> 22:21.260
We have a huge slate of originals incoming over the next couple months, plenty of which

22:21.260 --> 22:25.400
I'm sure you'll want to watch, then, in addition to the Logistics of X, we have perhaps

22:25.400 --> 22:30.140
the most ambitious, highest-budget Wendover original to date in pre-production right now.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.900
And if all that's not convincing enough already, it's worth mentioning that we designed

22:33.900 --> 22:38.360
Nebula to really be worthwhile not only to you, the viewer, but also to the creators.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.520
When you sign up at our link, we'll get a portion of your subscription revenue for

22:41.520 --> 22:45.580
as long as you stay subscribed, which gives us stable, predictable monthly revenue that

22:45.580 --> 22:49.740
we can rely on for growth, unlike with the ebbs and flows of ad rates.

22:49.740 --> 22:54.020
So, if you'd like to get access to Nebula's huge catalog of original content and help

22:54.020 --> 22:58.280
support the channel, just click the button on screen or head to Nebula.tv slash Wendover,

22:58.280 --> 23:02.580
and when you do, you'll get 40% off an annual plan, which brings the cost down to under

23:02.580 --> 23:04.100
$3 a month.
