1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
At base, every military has defensive capabilities—they're able to protect their homeland from foreign

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
threats.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,040
Iceland's armed forces, for example, comprise four ships, one airplane, three helicopters,

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,000
and four radar stations—all operated by the country's coast guard.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Beyond a small paramilitary peacekeeping unit made up of volunteers, the nation has nearly

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,580
no capabilities to deploy abroad—in fact, its constitution doesn't even have a mechanism

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,520
to declare war.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,940
Some militaries build on their defensive capabilities with limited expeditionary posturing—ability

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,880
to wage a small-scale operation abroad.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,840
This requires an expensive mix of training, equipment, and planning.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,560
Whereas domestic capabilities can be permanent and stationary, all expeditionary capabilities

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,040
inherently must be designed to be temporary and mobile.

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,000
This spans from the ability to fire a missile to the ability to cook up breakfasts, which

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,240
raises costs and complexity dramatically.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,320
For this reason, large-scale expeditionary capabilities are largely confined to the largest,

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,640
best-funded militaries like those of France, Mexico, or Canada.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,160
But then there's the US military—it is in a class of its own.

18
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,100
Whereas most nations can defend at home and some can deploy abroad, the US military has

19
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,760
a rather singular strategic posture—they have essentially turned the entire world into

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,280
home turf.

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,840
Their goal is complete—it's the ability to fight any sort of fight, in any location,

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,600
at any moment.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,940
To an American that might sound like the inherent function of a military, but it's a uniquely

24
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:38,160
US approach—most militaries are merely designed to respond to relevant regional threats and

25
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,280
can scale up to wage a war abroad if necessary.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
To be able to fulfill this all-encompassing mission, the US military has a degree of flexibility

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,400
and globality unmatched by any other, which incurs a near endless array of exceptional

28
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
costs for the force.

29
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,920
They pay to produce their own private label of chicken tenderloins and ship it all around

30
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,040
the world to places like this base in southeastern Turkey because they run a grocery store there

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,240
because they have thousands of service members stationed there because that's where they

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,500
keep about 50 nuclear warheads in case they decide to use one in Europe, Africa, the Middle

33
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,160
East, or elsewhere.

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,980
They pay for professional sports teams to incorporate patriotic ceremonies honoring

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,560
past and present service members into their games in order to help boost recruiting to

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,660
the level needed to staff all their roles worldwide.

37
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,540
They pay to develop an occasionally viral bipedal humanoid robot because they believe

38
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,520
that in the future they can gain a competitive advantage against other forces by having these

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,660
robots integrate into their ranks and fulfill the most dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks.

40
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,720
These costs grow and grow atop each other, and then span all around the world.

41
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,420
From a spatial and logistical standpoint, covering the globe is nothing less than a

42
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,540
monumentally challenging and expensive task.

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,300
Then, there's the temporal component—making sure that the right soldiers with the right

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,420
weapons and technology are in the right locations requires a predictive approach and proactive

45
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,020
planning, and predicting what future warfare looks like, then preparing for it, is also

46
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,100
an extremely expensive endeavor.

47
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,340
Take, for example, the USS Freedom, a first-of-its-kind littoral combat ship commissioned in 2008.

48
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,280
At just under 400 feet or 120 meters long, what this ship lacks in size, it more than

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,180
makes up for in design complexity and state-of-the-art technology.

50
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,580
This ship represents two entire decades of planning and predicting, researching and developing,

51
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,480
contracting and commissioning—a nearly inconceivable dedication of time and resources, but one

52
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,420
that begins to make sense when considering the expectations.

53
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,880
When conceived of in the 1990s, the littoral combat ship was meant to lead the American

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,440
Navy for the next half-century.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,860
With the Cold War coming to a close, the US Navy had found itself over-indexed in warships

56
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,820
designed to patrol and battle on the high seas.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,160
Suddenly without a comparable rival, the US was the world's single naval superpower,

58
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,360
and its fleet needed to reflect this new order.

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Now the new preeminent war was pirates, terrorists, and gunrunners zipping along coasts, requiring

60
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,700
something nimble, fast, and flexible enough to keep pace in the in-between—the coastal

61
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,380
waters, where threats were diverse and warfare often asymmetrical.

62
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,240
To fill the void, Navy officials presented two ideas—the DD-21, a larger ship capable

63
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,060
of holding its own on tight coastal waters, or what planners called the Street Fighter—a

64
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,180
smaller, sleeker, and critically cheaper option.

65
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,620
From the jump, these Street Fighters were more appealing—they'd require smaller

66
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,180
crews, they'd be fast, capable of surprising enemies, they'd be stealthy, and with the

67
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,660
advent of new hull technology, they'd be light enough to push 45 knots while still

68
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,020
having ocean-wide range and carrying a payload.

69
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,140
If that wasn't enough to future-proof such a concept, they'd be modular too, capable

70
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,180
of switching weapons systems and kits to fit different missions, from surface combat

71
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,780
to minesweeping.

72
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,980
But still, by 2000, such a Street Fighter was just a concept—a concept that the Navy

73
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,240
quickly turned over to private contractors after it proved too difficult to actualize

74
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
in-house.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,400
Entering agreements with both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin to each produce two ships

76
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,520
in two separate models, the Navy handed the project off to the private sector, assuming

77
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,980
the competition between the two for future LCS contracts would produce a 21st century

78
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,980
mainstay.

79
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,700
While the daunting scope had begun to add to the price tag, the Navy hoped these ships

80
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:22,360
could come in relatively cheap by shipbuilding standards—somewhere between $150 to $225

81
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,700
million per unit.

82
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:29,960
By 2009, the US had two ships—one from each contractor, but not four, as budget overrun

83
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,240
on both models was so extreme that the Navy cancelled the contracts for the second of

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
each.

85
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,360
What was supposed to be in the $200 million at most had ballooned to about double the

86
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
price.

87
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,200
The issue was, however, the LCS remained a critical cog in the planned new-age Navy fleet,

88
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:55,060
and they needed to buy a lot more than two—56 of them, in fact, or 82, or 63, or 55, or

89
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:59,740
most recently 52, depending on their evolving ship-force structure projections.

90
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,660
But no matter how many, they needed a lot, and needed them fast, as LCSs were expected

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,900
to replace old minesweepers and outdated frigates.

92
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,740
And rather than settling on a single class of LCSs previously planned to incentivize

93
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,900
competition, they proposed Congress an alternative—what they called a dual-award strategy, offering

94
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,820
each company a 10-ship contract over the next five years.

95
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,780
All the while, the problems with the Navy's current LCSs were already beginning to show.

96
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,180
As a general rule in shipbuilding, a ship can have range, it can have speed, and it

97
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,260
can have a heavy payload, but it can't have all three at once.

98
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,180
With speed as a principal mandate, both General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin had to get creative

99
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,820
and make sacrifices.

100
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,940
While both classes are able to reach an incredible 44 knots—some 10-15 more than a typical

101
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,980
Navy ship—they made separate design choices to get there.

102
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,100
For the Independence class, this meant a unique aluminum trimaran hull.

103
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,420
As for the Freedom class, while Lockheed Martin went with a more conventional steel monohull,

104
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,620
it innovated on the drivetrain side, developing a complicated combining gear that connected

105
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,960
the ship's diesel engines with its gas turbines.

106
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,860
Both designs were innovative, but both had problems.

107
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,180
Aluminum hulls, it turns out, are brittle, and at speeds of higher than just 15 knots

108
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,700
or on rough seas, they may well crack.

109
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,380
As for the combining gear, well, they were hard to keep running, as the components were

110
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,380
buried so deep in the ship that maintenance staff could hardly reach them, and when they

111
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,840
broke down, as they did early and often, they were so complicated that Navy personnel had

112
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,820
to wait around for Lockheed engineers to diagnose the problem and come up with a solution.

113
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,640
Then there was the issue of survivability.

114
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,320
Built as a combat ship, the LCS was intended to reach Level 1 survivability—the ability

115
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,000
to continue operations after an underwater explosive attack.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,800
In 2010, the same year it pushed for the congressional greenlight for 20 more of these ships, the

117
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,760
Navy conceded that the ships already produced hadn't reached Level 1 survivability.

118
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,800
And still, it got worse.

119
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,480
In the rush to get these ships on the water, no time was taken to ensure that all the ship

120
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
modules actually worked.

121
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,480
When they did get to testing the modules, it turned out they didn't.

122
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:12,360
The anti-submarine warfare module proved unreliable because the ship itself is so loud that the

123
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,880
towed sonar can't reliably pick up any other noise.

124
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,360
Similarly, the mine countermeasures mission package, which relies on onboard sensors and

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,080
an unmanned influence sweep system, has been plagued with delays, breakdowns, and a penchant

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,240
for causing false alarms.

127
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,680
What was supposed to be an endlessly customizable ship, capable for surface combat, submarine

128
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,280
hunting, and minesweeping, has effectively been rendered just a gunship that can't

129
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,260
take a hit.

130
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:44,440
Regardless of these varying limitations, as of 2023, the US Navy has purchased 30 LCSs.

131
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,840
They've broken down at sea, they've bumped into walls at the Panama Canal, they've

132
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,080
spent a winter stuck in an iced-over St. Lawrence River, they've run a handful of minor missions,

133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,980
and they've averaged about half a billion per ship to build.

134
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,700
For a ship that was supposed to be the future, the Littoral Combat Ship has proved nothing

135
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:07,080
short of a disaster—a reality the Navy's finally begun to come to grips with by decommissioning,

136
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,920
or working towards decommissioning, nine of the vessels.

137
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,900
The LCS, by all metrics, has failed to live up to its lofty billing.

138
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,320
And it has failed publicly and expensively.

139
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,320
But it's far from the only decades-long development project that's fallen on its

140
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
face.

141
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,300
Boeing-Sikorsky won the contract to build the Comanche helicopter in 1991, but after

142
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,480
a decade of work and $7 billion being poured into the project, only two prototypes ever

143
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,360
actually left the ground.

144
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,820
As for America's first stealth destroyer, the Zumwalt, its gun system has yet to prove

145
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,800
the range it's promised, its missile system can't hit targets consistently, and its

146
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,400
guided shells cost a prohibitive $800,000 per unit.

147
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,620
With similarly high hopes as the LCS, the Zumwalt project was eventually cut after only

148
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,680
three ships were built.

149
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,420
Then, most famously, the F-35, the joint strike fighter, adaptable, future-forward, state-of-the-art,

150
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,840
has seen one technical glitch and one busted budget after the next for two whole decades,

151
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,000
its cost ballooning to 89% over what was initially predicted.

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,820
And the list goes on with countless other smaller, multi-billion dollar projects.

153
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,300
To a certain extent, such mistakes and miscalculations make sense when working to invent the future

154
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,840
of warfare.

155
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,640
Expensive swings and misses are part of the development process.

156
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,440
But it wasn't always this way, and, increasingly, it seems the swings have gotten bigger and

157
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,200
the misses more frequent.

158
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,680
When the Department of Defense wants a ship or a plane or a weapons system built, there

159
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:44,040
is a select group of five companies it typically turns to—Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop

160
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,680
Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics.

161
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,160
Excluding Boeing, all these companies earn the majority of their revenue from US or Allied

162
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,360
military contracts, which only happen with the approval of the US.

163
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,520
But even excluding foreign defense revenue, 71% of Lockheed Martin revenue, for example,

164
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,360
comes from the US government.

165
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,840
That translates to $47.5 billion a year.

166
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,340
Put another way, Lockheed Martin is given more by the US government each year than NASA,

167
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,780
a major government agency.

168
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:20,960
In fact, if the defense contractor was a government agency, it'd be the 24th largest—it gets

169
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,680
more money from the US government than the majority of government agencies.

170
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,240
But unlike agencies, thanks to this business, Lockheed Martin profits nearly a billion dollars

171
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,280
a month, but war wasn't always such a profitable venture.

172
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,800
Technology was what brought the private sector to battle.

173
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,080
Whereas in centuries past militaries were primarily defined by human might, the advent

174
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,320
of airplanes marked perhaps the biggest instance yet of a non-military technology that could

175
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,400
be used to gain a militaristic advantage.

176
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,200
During and after World War I, a number of fledgling aerospace companies gained modest

177
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,260
contracts with the US military, contributing to annual overall production counts in the

178
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,360
dozens or hundreds.

179
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,040
But then came World War II.

180
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,000
Suddenly, the US and its allies needed as many planes as they could get, and with that,

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,160
the US government started awarding colossal contracts to anyone who could build an aircraft—Lockheed,

182
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,400
Goodyear, McDonnell, Douglas, Boeing, Hughes, Grumman, Northrop, Vought, Convair, and more.

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,080
While all these companies had existed in some form prior, the war was, for all intents and

184
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,000
purposes, what established them.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:35,000
McDonnell, for example, went from 15 employees to 5,000, Hughes went from 4 to 80,000.

186
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,120
As a sum, whereas in the six years leading up to the war, the US built a mere 20,000

187
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,440
aircraft, during it, the country's manufacturers produced a massive 300,000.

188
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,520
But then the war ended, and this was bad for business.

189
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,320
Aircraft manufacturers immediately struggled.

190
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Some shifted towards civilian aviation, others refocused on auto manufacturing, others still

191
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,360
consolidated, while the US government searched for contracts that could be used to keep this

192
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,280
new industrial sector, which played no small part in the Allied victory, afloat.

193
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,120
Rather quickly, though, a new conflict emerged—the Cold War.

194
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,120
In its early days, rumors arose that the Soviet Union had produced an inconceivable quantity

195
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
of long-range bombers.

196
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,880
As the world had now entered the nuclear age, this massively concerned American media, the

197
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,000
public, and ultimately Congress, it was believed that their newfound enemy could straight-up

198
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,080
eradicate the US.

199
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,440
In response, Eisenhower ordered an immediate ramp-up of American bomber production and

200
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,620
agreed to a Lockheed proposal to develop the U-2 high-altitude surveillance aircraft.

201
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,860
It would fly over the Soviet Union undetected, at least theoretically, and get a definitive

202
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,660
answer to just how formidable their bomber fleet had become.

203
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,600
The answer was not much—it was a mere fraction of what had been speculated, but Lockheed

204
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
and other manufacturers had already cashed their checks, so the answer meant little to

205
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
them.

206
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,860
A near-identical story emerged just a few years later with missiles.

207
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,840
The Soviets had launched Sputnik, and the Democrats of the era used the event to propagate

208
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,760
a narrative that Eisenhower and his Republican Party were falling behind Soviet technological

209
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
development.

210
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,360
John F. Kennedy, in the run-up to the 1960 presidential election, latched on to inflated

211
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,080
estimates of Soviet missile capabilities leaked from the Air Force and started to make the

212
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,720
perceived imbalance a central part of his campaign—he argued that his political foes

213
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,460
were ignoring this threat and the American public believed him.

214
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:32,120
Even after having received definitive evidence to refute this fact, he continued the rhetoric—it

215
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,440
was just so useful politically, which contributed to an acceleration of US missile development.

216
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
This was a much-needed windfall for US aerospace companies given the waning need for high-volume

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,520
aircraft development.

218
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,560
It was this very incident, in fact, that precipitated the first use of the phrase military-industrial

219
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,020
complex in Eisenhower's farewell address, where he warned of the phenomena's danger.

220
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,960
The subsequent escalation of the Cold War kept the defense industry alive and kicked

221
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,200
off an era of growth as US military spending started to consistently increase, but then

222
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,240
the wall came down.

223
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:11,200
With no more Cold War, the DoD warned contractors of massive cutbacks in spending.

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,760
This kicked off a feeding frenzy of consolidation and acquisition as the industry prepared to

225
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,240
weather what they believed would be the first sustained period of peace in their existence.

226
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,000
Defense spending did decrease, but only slightly, and only for a moment.

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,540
9-11 and the ensuing wars quickly returned the US to the historical trend of near-perpetual

228
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:35,900
spending build, and today, with these wars largely wrapped up, the new most popular justification

229
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,120
for military spending is growing Chinese military might.

230
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,920
Now, many of these supposed threats may be legitimate, but it's tough to know with

231
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,200
confidence because the defense industry, its lobbyists, and politicians are incredibly

232
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,220
effective at shaping public discourse.

233
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,760
In fact, the vast majority of the top think tanks are funded, at least in part, by defense

234
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,400
contractors.

235
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,760
These same think tanks are what are used by politicians and the media as supposedly expert

236
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,440
justification for funding to counter new emerging threats.

237
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,820
Ignoring, for the moment, the more unknowable question of whether warmongering for the sake

238
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:18,140
of defense industry profits is effective in practice, it's undeniable that the incentive

239
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,260
structures are certainly there.

240
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,260
But perhaps the best evidence for this phenomena's influence is the fact that, inflation-adjusted,

241
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,620
today's military spending is approaching World War II levels despite no active US involvement

242
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,420
in any major conflicts.

243
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,620
Of course, one can still debate whether this level of spending is justified by the present

244
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,520
geopolitical landscape, but what's undeniable is that taxpayers are getting less and less

245
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,660
for their money.

246
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,500
There was a time when defense spending had undeniably massive downstream effects.

247
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,340
The US military was a major financial force behind the development of world-changing innovations

248
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,660
like nuclear technology, GPS, and the internet.

249
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,420
In fact, in the 1960s, a full third of the entire world's research and development

250
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,580
funding came from US defense-related spending.

251
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:13,900
But today, that share has shrunk to a mere 3%, and what was once perhaps the most innovative

252
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,900
force in the world has become downright bad at it.

253
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,000
The US auto industry, for example, has quickened its pace of development—it now gets a car

254
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,700
to market faster.

255
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,780
The US commercial aircraft industry has trended slightly slower, yet in the realm of military

256
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,540
aircraft, something dramatic has occurred.

257
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:39,340
What used to take three or five or seven years now stretches into decades.

258
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,320
A key part of the problem is that the government has taken the inefficiencies of the public

259
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,380
sector and pushed them into the private sector, where they can be profited upon.

260
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,220
When developing a new generation of aircraft or ship or anything, the DoD sets strict parameters.

261
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,800
That flips traditional incentive structures—most industries see the private sector innovate

262
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,440
in order to create new products that their customers will want.

263
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,960
In this case, the customer tells the private sector exactly what they want, and this industry

264
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,840
spends heavily on lobbyists, many of whom used to work for the DoD, in order to shape

265
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,340
contracts towards what they can build with minimal risky research and development, therefore

266
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,280
stifling innovation.

267
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,400
But even then, the risk for the contractor is mitigated further because a big chunk of

268
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,680
contracts are awarded on a cost-plus basis.

269
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,640
That's to say, the government pays for what it costs to build a given technology,

270
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,160
then the contractor gets a percentage on top of that, as profit.

271
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:43,460
This directly disincentivizes cost efficiency, as the more a project costs, the more the

272
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,380
contractor makes.

273
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,520
Of course, in normal industries the contractor would still be incentivized towards efficiency

274
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,120
in order to win the next contract, but in this industry, two-thirds of major weapon

275
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,280
system contracts, for example, are bid upon by just one company, while yet more contracts

276
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,920
are awarded without a competitive bidding process.

277
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,380
Perhaps most egregiously, it's well understood that some contracts are awarded to struggling,

278
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,880
ineffective companies simply because the US government does not want that company to go

279
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,840
bankrupt and therefore for its manufacturing capabilities to be lost.

280
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,640
This is perhaps one of the strongest justifications for the spending—the US military cannot

281
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,880
afford for Lockheed or Boeing or Raytheon or the other contractors to go bankrupt because

282
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,020
they are the only companies in the world capable of producing the technologies that bestow

283
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,560
the fighting force with such a technological advantage.

284
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,800
So, a situation has been crafted where these companies are too important to fail, and they

285
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:49,160
know that, so they can profit off of their necessity rather than their effectiveness.

286
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,720
The aforementioned only scratches the surface of the deep web of incentives that keeps the

287
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,040
military-industrial complex alive, but at its core, it's as simple as this—it is

288
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,880
good for politicians politically, and good for contractors economically, to create the

289
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,340
perception of problems that simply do not exist.

290
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,780
No one gets punished when a threat does not materialize—in fact, they can argue that

291
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,520
their response, upon which they profited politically or economically, mitigated the threat.

292
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,120
Meanwhile, individuals are punished when a threat they argued did not exist materializes,

293
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,020
disincentivizing anyone from doing so.

294
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:33,320
Fear is an incredibly powerful emotion, and, at its core, the military-industrial complex

295
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,640
has created an incredibly effective system to capitalize upon it.

296
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,440
As you might have noticed, the last Wendover video is no longer on YouTube.

297
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,160
It's a somewhat long and frustrating story, but to summarize, there was a quick clip in

298
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,680
it where you could see some personal info on a passport.

299
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,560
YouTube's harassment and cyberbullying policy includes a provision against sharing personally

300
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,720
identifiable information such as this, and even though it was clearly unintentional,

301
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,020
the video was taken down as a policy strike, which seems fair given the wording of this

302
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,020
policy.

303
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:09,300
Unfortunately, unlike with most privacy issues on YouTube videos, because this was taken

304
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,220
down as a policy strike, there is no ability for us to rectify the issue even though it

305
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,820
could be done with a quick blur, so the video is down permanently, at least on YouTube.

306
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,280
You see, a couple years ago, some creator friends and I got together to try to both

307
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,980
build on the best parts of YouTube and rectify some of its issues.

308
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,000
We called it Nebula, and it's gone fantastically, with over half a million subscribers, hundreds

309
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,500
of thousands of monthly active users, Streamy Award nominations, and more, but one small

310
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,700
way we improved from YouTube was by adding this—a little button on our backend that

311
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,360
allows the creator to swap files on a video to correct mistakes, make improvements, or,

312
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,060
in this case, blur that passport, so the video's still up on Nebula.

313
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:53,700
But we also designed the platform with a unique business model that allows us to fund higher-budget,

314
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,660
exclusive content, so another video that's up on Nebula is the latest episode of the

315
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,400
Logistics of X about arms manufacturing.

316
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,100
It builds on this video's topic to show the nitty-gritty of how the US military and

317
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,340
its industry partners manufacture and distribute the physical weapons of war without those

318
