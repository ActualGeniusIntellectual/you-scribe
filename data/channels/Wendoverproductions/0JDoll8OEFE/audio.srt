3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,460
Imagine a train that took you from Washington DC to Dallas, Texas in nine hours, or Paris,

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,820
France to Athens, Greece in nine hours, or Adelaide, South Australia to Perth, Western

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,860
Australia in nine hours.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,200
These train trips actually take 44 hours, 44 hours, and 41 hours respectively so the

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,560
idea of making any of these trips by train in nine hours seems almost absurd.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,760
In China, though, that's reality.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,740
In September, 2018, the country opened up a brand new high-speed rail route with direct

10
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,200
trains from Hong Kong to Beijing.

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,260
This is about the same distance as DC to Dallas, Paris to Athens, or Adelaide to Perth and

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,800
yet these trains make the trip in only 8 hours and 56 minutes.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,040
What makes this even more impressive is that ten years ago, in 2008, at the time of the

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,200
Beijing Olympics, China's high-speed rail network consisted of this.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,320
We'll have to zoom in because the extent of the network was one 19 mile long maglev

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,420
train from Shanghai airport to the outskirts of Shanghai and a traditional high-speed rail

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,160
line from Beijing to the coastal city of Tianjin.

18
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,960
Today, ten years later, that network has expanded into this.

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,040
China has 8 times as much high-speed track as France, 10 times as much as Japan, 20 times

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,260
as much as the UK, and 500 times as much as the US.

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,260
In fact, China has as much high-speed rail track as the rest of the world combined.

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:36,060
It is staggering the amount of progress they have made in such a short amount of time.

23
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,420
Traditionally, high-speed rail exists in small countries with rich populations by the likes

24
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,660
of Germany, France, and Japan.

25
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,440
China is neither of these things.

26
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,620
The country is enormous—about the same size as the US—and is also not rich.

27
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,740
While no longer poor, China is definitively a middle-income country.

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,180
It's about as rich as Mexico, Thailand, or Brazil.

29
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,380
In fact, despite being the country with the most high-speed rail in the world, China is

30
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,380
also the poorest country in the world to have any high-speed rail.

31
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,900
Despite the country's vast size, China's huge population makes it very dense especially

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
in the east half.

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,980
This means that China does have large cities close enough together where it makes sense

34
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,420
to take the train rather than the plane.

35
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,380
Trips like Guangzhou to Changsha, a distance of 350 miles, take an hour by plane or two

36
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,580
hours and twenty minutes by train.

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,620
When factoring in the time it takes to check in, go through security, and board, it absolutely

38
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,820
makes sense to go by train when traveling between these two cities even without considering

39
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,960
that the high-speed train is cheaper than flying.

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,700
High-speed rail even makes sense in China on longer routes where it wouldn't in other

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,700
countries.

42
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,420
Beijing and Shanghai, for example, are about 650 miles apart.

43
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,020
Normally, that would be too far for high-speed rail to make sense.

44
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:53,100
Paris and Barcelona, for example, are 500 miles apart—closer than Beijing and Shanghai—but

45
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,360
only two high-speed trains a day run between the two cities compared to about 20 flights.

46
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,540
Between Beijing and Shanghai, on the other hand, about 50 flights run per day compared

47
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,540
to 41 trains.

48
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,420
Considering the trains carry far more people each—up to 1,200—trains are therefore

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,000
the dominant means of transport between these two cities.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,700
There are a few differences between these two routes.

51
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,820
For one, while Beijing-Shanghai by train takes 4 hours and 28 minutes, Paris-Barcelona, despite

52
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,880
being a shorter distance, takes a longer 6 hours and 25 minutes.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,540
The other factor, though, is about the competition.

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,800
Europe has an efficient air transport network dominated by budget airlines that are often

55
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,540
far cheaper than trains.

56
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,020
You can find tickets for flights between Paris and Barcelona for as little as $12 while the

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,640
cheapest Beijing-Shanghai flights go for $74.

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,860
Air travel within China is also far from efficient.

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,220
China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China, the three largest Chinese airlines, arrive

60
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,500
on time an average of 67, 66, and 63% of the time respectively.

61
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,720
A big reason for this is that there's just not enough room in the skies.

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,720
A majority of China's airspace is military controlled meaning that there are just these

63
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,980
narrow flight corridors that account for 30% of airspace where civilian planes can fly.

64
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,380
With tons of planes and not much room to fly, planes are frequently delayed by air traffic

65
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,360
control to wait for the airspace to clear up which leads to the abysmal on-time readings

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,080
of the country's airlines.

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,320
While the Beijing-Shanghai flight takes only two hours, the potential of delays, along

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,700
with all the other factors that make air travel slower, help make the train the popular means

69
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,300
of transport on this longer route.

70
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,120
Other train routes in China, though, make less sense.

71
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,580
For example, in 2014, the new high-speed train line opened between Langzhou and Irimchi.

72
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,700
These two cities are relatively small by China standards.

73
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:44,380
They both have a population of 3.5 million and between them are only small towns.

74
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,940
They're also not close—about 1,000 miles separate them.

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,580
This project could therefore be compared to building a high-speed train from Denver to

76
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,640
Seattle—they're modestly sized cities a long ways apart with nothing big in between.

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,280
Some people would use it, but it wouldn't make any financial sense.

78
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,600
In China, Langzhou and Irimchi are not small cities but there's really nothing big in

79
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,700
between and, at that distance, there's no sense not flying.

80
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,920
The Langzhou-Irimchi high-speed train takes 11 hours compared to the 2.5 hour flight and

81
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,280
the construction cost of that line was $20 billion meaning that, if every seat on every

82
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,880
train was filled tickets would still have to cost $400 each way just to make back the

83
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,520
construction cost in 30 years.

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,760
In reality, tickets cost about $80 and trains are far from full meaning that this rail line

85
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,720
is just insanely far from profitable.

86
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,780
The ticket revenues from these trains reportedly don't even cover the cost of electricity

87
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,520
for the line let alone construction and other operating costs.

88
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,820
So why would the Chinese government sink so much money into something that has no prospects

89
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,880
of really ever making money?

90
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,480
Well, politics.

91
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,360
Irimchi is the capital of the Xinjiang province.

92
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,080
While 92% of China's population is Han Chinese, the Xinjiang province is primarily Uyghur—one

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,220
of the minority ethnic groups of China—and there has been an ongoing, fairly strong separatist

94
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:08,080
movement by the Uyghurs from China that has often turned violent.

95
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,000
The central government in Beijing, however, wants the Xinjiang province to be just as

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,920
integrated as the rest of the country and has tried a variety of methods to force this

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,560
including moving Han Chinese into the region and the imprisonment of Uyghurs in so-called

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,100
re-education camps.

99
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,320
The high-speed train is just the most recent tactic to bring Xinjiang closer to Beijing

100
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,980
and this is no secret.

101
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,620
The central government is fully upfront in saying that the line was built to promote,

102
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,940
as they call it, ethnic unity.

103
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,340
This isn't the first time that they've used this tactic of railroad politics—Tibet,

104
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,700
a region even better known than Xinjiang for its independence movement, was the last region

105
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,900
in China not to have a railway due to its small population and intense terrain.

106
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,580
The central government still wanted to build one, though, to bring it closer to the rest

107
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,080
of the country and so they did.

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,900
Trains now run directly from Beijing to Lhasa, Tibet in 47 hours on the highest elevation

109
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,920
rail line in the world.

110
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,460
These trains reach an elevation of 16,640 feet—so high that passengers have to use

111
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,540
direct oxygen supply.

112
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,100
Even the train to Hong Kong serves the central government's goal of further integrating

113
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,540
Hong Kong, which is an autonomous special administrative region, into mainland China.

114
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,620
While high-speed trains to Hong Kong certainly do make a lot more sense than trains to the

115
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,660
Xinjiang province, many Hong Kongers have not greeted the new service kindly as they

116
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,020
view it as an encroachment on the autonomy guaranteed to them by Hong Kong basic law.

117
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,340
The most controversial part has not been the fact that there's a train but rather that

118
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,340
the station in Hong Kong includes an area that is effectively now part of mainland China

119
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,460
since people pass through border controls before boarding the train in Hong Kong.

120
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,820
Just like any country, what having a high-speed, efficient rail network in China is doing is

121
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,240
bringing the country together and making it stronger even if it's bringing together

122
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,500
people that want to stay apart.

123
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,480
No matter their motives, it's clear that China is building their high-speed rail network

124
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,840
more efficiently than any other country.

125
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,040
To compare, this is the plan for California's high-speed rail line from San Francisco to

126
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
the Los Angeles area.

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,720
It's currently in very early phases of construction and is expected to open by 2029.

128
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,960
Of course, that means that the time it will take for California's high-speed rail network

129
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,580
to go from this to this is the same as the time it took China's high-speed rail network

130
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,800
to go from this to this but, the main thing to look at is cost.

131
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,320
This California network is expected to cost $77 billion and is 520 miles long meaning

132
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,200
that it will cost $148 million per mile to build.

133
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,700
China, on the other hand, is building their network at a cost of only $30 million per

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,700
mile.

135
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,120
Of course, labor costs are lower in China and their network crosses more rural areas

136
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,240
where land acquisition costs are lower but, what's more meaningful is that they've

137
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,980
turned building high-speed rail into almost an assembly line process where they can mass

138
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,820
produce even the most expensive elements like viaducts and tunnels.

139
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,340
In true Chinese fashion, with scale they're making high-speed cheaper.

140
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,780
The big difference between China and a lot of the western world, particularly countries

141
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:00,320
like the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, is that high-speed rail is at

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,500
the top of the government's priorities.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,260
Unsurprisingly given their government structure, in many ways, China has placed social benefit,

144
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,140
at least by the definition of the central government, ahead of profitability when developing

145
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,100
their high-speed rail network.

146
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,440
High-speed rail lines just aren't as profitable as other means of transport like planes but

147
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,780
they are undoubtedly better for countries so you have to consider the social benefit

148
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,820
when looking at their overall profitability.

149
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,260
For the San Francisco to LA high-speed rail route, for example, one study found that the

150
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,300
social benefit derived from lower carbon emissions, higher worker productivity, and reduced casualties

151
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,400
from fewer people on the road would be equivalent to about $440 million per year.

152
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,460
As it turns out, this is almost the exact amount that the state will have to subsidize

153
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,220
the line for it to break even.

154
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,580
The China Railway Corporation, a state-owned enterprise, is actually slightly profitable

155
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:52,440
although it does have huge amounts of debts and is helped by government subsidies.

156
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,380
The benefit to the Chinese people, though, is huge.

157
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,020
The high-speed rail allows those who can't afford to live in the most expensive cities

158
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,580
like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to easily commute from cheaper suburbs by high-speed

159
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
rail.

160
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,340
Thanks to the high-speed rail, there are now 75 million people who can commute to Shanghai

161
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
in under an hour.

162
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,220
It is growing what are already some of the largest cities and, when it comes to cities,

163
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,860
size is strength.

164
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,540
These lines connecting the east's largest cities are some of the most profitable rail

165
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,020
lines in the world and they're making living and working in China easier but the question

166
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,140
is, when we look back decades from now, whether the high-speed trains to smaller cities will

167
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,400
have made sense.

168
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,320
Out of a desire to keep the lines going straight between the big cities, the stops for smaller

169
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,580
cities are often out in the countryside dozens of miles away from the city core.

170
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,740
The high-speed station for Hanyang, for example, a smaller city of only a million, is about

171
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,780
a 45 minute drive east of the city center.

172
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,140
The hope is that new development will spring up around the stations but this network structure,

173
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,640
even if it saves time on the train, wastes time before and after which degrades the benefit

174
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,300
of high-speed rail.

175
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,700
In all, China is really the first country to have experimented with long-distance, high-speed

176
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,200
rail through less dense areas in its west.

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
In the east, though, these trains are enlarging the country's economic power—it's just

178
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,240
one of the many factors speeding up China's catch-up with the world's richest countries.

179
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,720
Even though China is building these trains for less and innovating on the construction

180
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,280
of high-speed rail, the real reason why China is so good at building railways is because

181
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,000
they have the one thing that almost every other country lacks—the political will for

182
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,400
high-speed trains.

183
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,280
Whenever I'm looking to launch something new, one of the first things I think about

184
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,980
is how to present it online.

185
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,660
I think about domain names, emails, websites, and where I always go to do all that is Squarespace.

186
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,260
As you probably know by now, Squarespace is the all-in-one solution to building a web

187
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,500
presence for whatever you do.

188
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,320
Being in the internet age, it's incredibly important to present yourself well online

189
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,280
and Squarespace's beautiful designer templates, customizable website builder, and 24-7 award-winning

190
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,020
customer support help you do all that for a reasonable monthly cost.

191
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,380
It's a much better solution than learning how to code a website or paying someone thousands

192
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,380
to do it.

193
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,960
It is also, of course, made easier by the fact that you can get 10% off by going to

194
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,300
Squarespace.com slash Wendover and you'll be supporting the show by using that link.

196
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,280
Thank you.
