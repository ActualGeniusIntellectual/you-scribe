00:08.240 --> 00:14.460
Imagine a train that took you from Washington DC to Dallas, Texas in nine hours, or Paris,

00:14.460 --> 00:19.820
France to Athens, Greece in nine hours, or Adelaide, South Australia to Perth, Western

00:19.820 --> 00:21.860
Australia in nine hours.

00:21.860 --> 00:27.200
These train trips actually take 44 hours, 44 hours, and 41 hours respectively so the

00:27.200 --> 00:32.560
idea of making any of these trips by train in nine hours seems almost absurd.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.760
In China, though, that's reality.

00:34.760 --> 00:39.740
In September, 2018, the country opened up a brand new high-speed rail route with direct

00:39.740 --> 00:42.200
trains from Hong Kong to Beijing.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.260
This is about the same distance as DC to Dallas, Paris to Athens, or Adelaide to Perth and

00:47.260 --> 00:51.800
yet these trains make the trip in only 8 hours and 56 minutes.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.040
What makes this even more impressive is that ten years ago, in 2008, at the time of the

00:56.040 --> 01:00.200
Beijing Olympics, China's high-speed rail network consisted of this.

01:00.200 --> 01:04.320
We'll have to zoom in because the extent of the network was one 19 mile long maglev

01:04.320 --> 01:08.420
train from Shanghai airport to the outskirts of Shanghai and a traditional high-speed rail

01:08.420 --> 01:11.160
line from Beijing to the coastal city of Tianjin.

01:11.160 --> 01:15.960
Today, ten years later, that network has expanded into this.

01:15.960 --> 01:21.040
China has 8 times as much high-speed track as France, 10 times as much as Japan, 20 times

01:21.040 --> 01:25.260
as much as the UK, and 500 times as much as the US.

01:25.260 --> 01:30.260
In fact, China has as much high-speed rail track as the rest of the world combined.

01:30.260 --> 01:36.060
It is staggering the amount of progress they have made in such a short amount of time.

01:36.060 --> 01:40.420
Traditionally, high-speed rail exists in small countries with rich populations by the likes

01:40.420 --> 01:42.660
of Germany, France, and Japan.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.440
China is neither of these things.

01:44.440 --> 01:49.620
The country is enormous—about the same size as the US—and is also not rich.

01:49.620 --> 01:53.740
While no longer poor, China is definitively a middle-income country.

01:53.740 --> 01:57.180
It's about as rich as Mexico, Thailand, or Brazil.

01:57.180 --> 02:01.380
In fact, despite being the country with the most high-speed rail in the world, China is

02:01.380 --> 02:05.380
also the poorest country in the world to have any high-speed rail.

02:05.380 --> 02:09.900
Despite the country's vast size, China's huge population makes it very dense especially

02:09.900 --> 02:11.300
in the east half.

02:11.300 --> 02:14.980
This means that China does have large cities close enough together where it makes sense

02:14.980 --> 02:17.420
to take the train rather than the plane.

02:17.420 --> 02:22.380
Trips like Guangzhou to Changsha, a distance of 350 miles, take an hour by plane or two

02:22.380 --> 02:24.580
hours and twenty minutes by train.

02:24.580 --> 02:28.620
When factoring in the time it takes to check in, go through security, and board, it absolutely

02:28.620 --> 02:32.820
makes sense to go by train when traveling between these two cities even without considering

02:32.820 --> 02:35.960
that the high-speed train is cheaper than flying.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.700
High-speed rail even makes sense in China on longer routes where it wouldn't in other

02:39.700 --> 02:40.700
countries.

02:40.700 --> 02:44.420
Beijing and Shanghai, for example, are about 650 miles apart.

02:44.420 --> 02:48.020
Normally, that would be too far for high-speed rail to make sense.

02:48.020 --> 02:53.100
Paris and Barcelona, for example, are 500 miles apart—closer than Beijing and Shanghai—but

02:53.100 --> 02:58.360
only two high-speed trains a day run between the two cities compared to about 20 flights.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.540
Between Beijing and Shanghai, on the other hand, about 50 flights run per day compared

03:02.540 --> 03:04.540
to 41 trains.

03:04.540 --> 03:08.420
Considering the trains carry far more people each—up to 1,200—trains are therefore

03:08.420 --> 03:12.000
the dominant means of transport between these two cities.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.700
There are a few differences between these two routes.

03:14.700 --> 03:19.820
For one, while Beijing-Shanghai by train takes 4 hours and 28 minutes, Paris-Barcelona, despite

03:19.820 --> 03:23.880
being a shorter distance, takes a longer 6 hours and 25 minutes.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.540
The other factor, though, is about the competition.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.800
Europe has an efficient air transport network dominated by budget airlines that are often

03:30.800 --> 03:32.540
far cheaper than trains.

03:32.540 --> 03:37.020
You can find tickets for flights between Paris and Barcelona for as little as $12 while the

03:37.020 --> 03:40.640
cheapest Beijing-Shanghai flights go for $74.

03:40.640 --> 03:43.860
Air travel within China is also far from efficient.

03:43.860 --> 03:48.220
China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China, the three largest Chinese airlines, arrive

03:48.220 --> 03:53.500
on time an average of 67, 66, and 63% of the time respectively.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.720
A big reason for this is that there's just not enough room in the skies.

03:57.720 --> 04:01.720
A majority of China's airspace is military controlled meaning that there are just these

04:01.720 --> 04:06.980
narrow flight corridors that account for 30% of airspace where civilian planes can fly.

04:06.980 --> 04:11.380
With tons of planes and not much room to fly, planes are frequently delayed by air traffic

04:11.380 --> 04:15.360
control to wait for the airspace to clear up which leads to the abysmal on-time readings

04:15.360 --> 04:17.080
of the country's airlines.

04:17.080 --> 04:21.320
While the Beijing-Shanghai flight takes only two hours, the potential of delays, along

04:21.320 --> 04:25.700
with all the other factors that make air travel slower, help make the train the popular means

04:25.700 --> 04:28.300
of transport on this longer route.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.120
Other train routes in China, though, make less sense.

04:31.120 --> 04:36.580
For example, in 2014, the new high-speed train line opened between Langzhou and Irimchi.

04:36.580 --> 04:39.700
These two cities are relatively small by China standards.

04:39.700 --> 04:44.380
They both have a population of 3.5 million and between them are only small towns.

04:44.380 --> 04:48.940
They're also not close—about 1,000 miles separate them.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.580
This project could therefore be compared to building a high-speed train from Denver to

04:52.580 --> 04:57.640
Seattle—they're modestly sized cities a long ways apart with nothing big in between.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.280
Some people would use it, but it wouldn't make any financial sense.

05:01.280 --> 05:05.600
In China, Langzhou and Irimchi are not small cities but there's really nothing big in

05:05.600 --> 05:09.700
between and, at that distance, there's no sense not flying.

05:09.700 --> 05:14.920
The Langzhou-Irimchi high-speed train takes 11 hours compared to the 2.5 hour flight and

05:14.920 --> 05:20.280
the construction cost of that line was $20 billion meaning that, if every seat on every

05:20.280 --> 05:24.880
train was filled tickets would still have to cost $400 each way just to make back the

05:24.880 --> 05:27.520
construction cost in 30 years.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.760
In reality, tickets cost about $80 and trains are far from full meaning that this rail line

05:32.760 --> 05:35.720
is just insanely far from profitable.

05:35.720 --> 05:39.780
The ticket revenues from these trains reportedly don't even cover the cost of electricity

05:39.780 --> 05:43.520
for the line let alone construction and other operating costs.

05:43.520 --> 05:47.820
So why would the Chinese government sink so much money into something that has no prospects

05:47.820 --> 05:49.880
of really ever making money?

05:49.880 --> 05:51.480
Well, politics.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.360
Irimchi is the capital of the Xinjiang province.

05:54.360 --> 06:00.080
While 92% of China's population is Han Chinese, the Xinjiang province is primarily Uyghur—one

06:00.080 --> 06:04.220
of the minority ethnic groups of China—and there has been an ongoing, fairly strong separatist

06:04.220 --> 06:08.080
movement by the Uyghurs from China that has often turned violent.

06:08.080 --> 06:12.000
The central government in Beijing, however, wants the Xinjiang province to be just as

06:12.000 --> 06:15.920
integrated as the rest of the country and has tried a variety of methods to force this

06:15.920 --> 06:20.560
including moving Han Chinese into the region and the imprisonment of Uyghurs in so-called

06:20.560 --> 06:22.100
re-education camps.

06:22.100 --> 06:26.320
The high-speed train is just the most recent tactic to bring Xinjiang closer to Beijing

06:26.320 --> 06:27.980
and this is no secret.

06:27.980 --> 06:31.620
The central government is fully upfront in saying that the line was built to promote,

06:31.620 --> 06:33.940
as they call it, ethnic unity.

06:33.940 --> 06:38.340
This isn't the first time that they've used this tactic of railroad politics—Tibet,

06:38.340 --> 06:42.700
a region even better known than Xinjiang for its independence movement, was the last region

06:42.700 --> 06:46.900
in China not to have a railway due to its small population and intense terrain.

06:46.900 --> 06:50.580
The central government still wanted to build one, though, to bring it closer to the rest

06:50.580 --> 06:53.080
of the country and so they did.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.900
Trains now run directly from Beijing to Lhasa, Tibet in 47 hours on the highest elevation

06:57.900 --> 06:59.920
rail line in the world.

06:59.920 --> 07:05.460
These trains reach an elevation of 16,640 feet—so high that passengers have to use

07:05.460 --> 07:07.540
direct oxygen supply.

07:07.540 --> 07:11.100
Even the train to Hong Kong serves the central government's goal of further integrating

07:11.100 --> 07:15.540
Hong Kong, which is an autonomous special administrative region, into mainland China.

07:15.540 --> 07:19.620
While high-speed trains to Hong Kong certainly do make a lot more sense than trains to the

07:19.620 --> 07:23.660
Xinjiang province, many Hong Kongers have not greeted the new service kindly as they

07:23.660 --> 07:28.020
view it as an encroachment on the autonomy guaranteed to them by Hong Kong basic law.

07:28.020 --> 07:31.340
The most controversial part has not been the fact that there's a train but rather that

07:31.340 --> 07:35.340
the station in Hong Kong includes an area that is effectively now part of mainland China

07:35.340 --> 07:39.460
since people pass through border controls before boarding the train in Hong Kong.

07:39.460 --> 07:43.820
Just like any country, what having a high-speed, efficient rail network in China is doing is

07:43.820 --> 07:47.240
bringing the country together and making it stronger even if it's bringing together

07:47.240 --> 07:49.500
people that want to stay apart.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.480
No matter their motives, it's clear that China is building their high-speed rail network

07:53.480 --> 07:55.840
more efficiently than any other country.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.040
To compare, this is the plan for California's high-speed rail line from San Francisco to

08:00.040 --> 08:01.280
the Los Angeles area.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.720
It's currently in very early phases of construction and is expected to open by 2029.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.960
Of course, that means that the time it will take for California's high-speed rail network

08:09.960 --> 08:13.580
to go from this to this is the same as the time it took China's high-speed rail network

08:13.580 --> 08:17.800
to go from this to this but, the main thing to look at is cost.

08:17.800 --> 08:23.320
This California network is expected to cost $77 billion and is 520 miles long meaning

08:23.320 --> 08:27.200
that it will cost $148 million per mile to build.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.700
China, on the other hand, is building their network at a cost of only $30 million per

08:31.700 --> 08:32.700
mile.

08:32.700 --> 08:36.120
Of course, labor costs are lower in China and their network crosses more rural areas

08:36.120 --> 08:40.240
where land acquisition costs are lower but, what's more meaningful is that they've

08:40.240 --> 08:43.980
turned building high-speed rail into almost an assembly line process where they can mass

08:43.980 --> 08:47.820
produce even the most expensive elements like viaducts and tunnels.

08:47.820 --> 08:52.340
In true Chinese fashion, with scale they're making high-speed cheaper.

08:52.340 --> 08:55.780
The big difference between China and a lot of the western world, particularly countries

08:55.780 --> 09:00.320
like the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, is that high-speed rail is at

09:00.320 --> 09:02.500
the top of the government's priorities.

09:02.500 --> 09:07.260
Unsurprisingly given their government structure, in many ways, China has placed social benefit,

09:07.260 --> 09:11.140
at least by the definition of the central government, ahead of profitability when developing

09:11.140 --> 09:13.100
their high-speed rail network.

09:13.100 --> 09:17.440
High-speed rail lines just aren't as profitable as other means of transport like planes but

09:17.440 --> 09:21.780
they are undoubtedly better for countries so you have to consider the social benefit

09:21.780 --> 09:23.820
when looking at their overall profitability.

09:23.820 --> 09:28.260
For the San Francisco to LA high-speed rail route, for example, one study found that the

09:28.260 --> 09:33.300
social benefit derived from lower carbon emissions, higher worker productivity, and reduced casualties

09:33.300 --> 09:38.400
from fewer people on the road would be equivalent to about $440 million per year.

09:38.400 --> 09:42.460
As it turns out, this is almost the exact amount that the state will have to subsidize

09:42.460 --> 09:44.220
the line for it to break even.

09:44.220 --> 09:48.580
The China Railway Corporation, a state-owned enterprise, is actually slightly profitable

09:48.580 --> 09:52.440
although it does have huge amounts of debts and is helped by government subsidies.

09:52.440 --> 09:55.380
The benefit to the Chinese people, though, is huge.

09:55.380 --> 09:59.020
The high-speed rail allows those who can't afford to live in the most expensive cities

09:59.020 --> 10:03.580
like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to easily commute from cheaper suburbs by high-speed

10:03.580 --> 10:04.580
rail.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.340
Thanks to the high-speed rail, there are now 75 million people who can commute to Shanghai

10:09.340 --> 10:10.340
in under an hour.

10:10.340 --> 10:15.220
It is growing what are already some of the largest cities and, when it comes to cities,

10:15.220 --> 10:16.860
size is strength.

10:16.860 --> 10:20.540
These lines connecting the east's largest cities are some of the most profitable rail

10:20.540 --> 10:25.020
lines in the world and they're making living and working in China easier but the question

10:25.020 --> 10:29.140
is, when we look back decades from now, whether the high-speed trains to smaller cities will

10:29.140 --> 10:30.400
have made sense.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.320
Out of a desire to keep the lines going straight between the big cities, the stops for smaller

10:34.320 --> 10:38.580
cities are often out in the countryside dozens of miles away from the city core.

10:38.580 --> 10:42.740
The high-speed station for Hanyang, for example, a smaller city of only a million, is about

10:42.740 --> 10:45.780
a 45 minute drive east of the city center.

10:45.780 --> 10:50.140
The hope is that new development will spring up around the stations but this network structure,

10:50.140 --> 10:54.640
even if it saves time on the train, wastes time before and after which degrades the benefit

10:54.640 --> 10:56.300
of high-speed rail.

10:56.300 --> 11:00.700
In all, China is really the first country to have experimented with long-distance, high-speed

11:00.700 --> 11:03.200
rail through less dense areas in its west.

11:03.200 --> 11:07.440
In the east, though, these trains are enlarging the country's economic power—it's just

11:07.440 --> 11:12.240
one of the many factors speeding up China's catch-up with the world's richest countries.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.720
Even though China is building these trains for less and innovating on the construction

11:15.720 --> 11:20.280
of high-speed rail, the real reason why China is so good at building railways is because

11:20.280 --> 11:25.000
they have the one thing that almost every other country lacks—the political will for

11:25.000 --> 11:27.400
high-speed trains.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.280
Whenever I'm looking to launch something new, one of the first things I think about

11:30.280 --> 11:31.980
is how to present it online.

11:31.980 --> 11:37.660
I think about domain names, emails, websites, and where I always go to do all that is Squarespace.

11:37.660 --> 11:41.260
As you probably know by now, Squarespace is the all-in-one solution to building a web

11:41.260 --> 11:43.500
presence for whatever you do.

11:43.500 --> 11:47.320

11:47.320 --> 11:52.280
and Squarespace's beautiful designer templates, customizable website builder, and 24-7 award-winning

11:52.280 --> 11:56.020
