8240	14460	Imagine a train that took you from Washington DC to Dallas, Texas in nine hours, or Paris,
14460	19820	France to Athens, Greece in nine hours, or Adelaide, South Australia to Perth, Western
19820	21860	Australia in nine hours.
21860	27200	These train trips actually take 44 hours, 44 hours, and 41 hours respectively so the
27200	32560	idea of making any of these trips by train in nine hours seems almost absurd.
32560	34760	In China, though, that's reality.
34760	39740	In September, 2018, the country opened up a brand new high-speed rail route with direct
39740	42200	trains from Hong Kong to Beijing.
42200	47260	This is about the same distance as DC to Dallas, Paris to Athens, or Adelaide to Perth and
47260	51800	yet these trains make the trip in only 8 hours and 56 minutes.
51800	56040	What makes this even more impressive is that ten years ago, in 2008, at the time of the
56040	60200	Beijing Olympics, China's high-speed rail network consisted of this.
60200	64320	We'll have to zoom in because the extent of the network was one 19 mile long maglev
64320	68420	train from Shanghai airport to the outskirts of Shanghai and a traditional high-speed rail
68420	71160	line from Beijing to the coastal city of Tianjin.
71160	75960	Today, ten years later, that network has expanded into this.
75960	81040	China has 8 times as much high-speed track as France, 10 times as much as Japan, 20 times
81040	85260	as much as the UK, and 500 times as much as the US.
85260	90260	In fact, China has as much high-speed rail track as the rest of the world combined.
90260	96060	It is staggering the amount of progress they have made in such a short amount of time.
96060	100420	Traditionally, high-speed rail exists in small countries with rich populations by the likes
100420	102660	of Germany, France, and Japan.
102660	104440	China is neither of these things.
104440	109620	The country is enormous—about the same size as the US—and is also not rich.
109620	113740	While no longer poor, China is definitively a middle-income country.
113740	117180	It's about as rich as Mexico, Thailand, or Brazil.
117180	121380	In fact, despite being the country with the most high-speed rail in the world, China is
121380	125380	also the poorest country in the world to have any high-speed rail.
125380	129900	Despite the country's vast size, China's huge population makes it very dense especially
129900	131300	in the east half.
131300	134980	This means that China does have large cities close enough together where it makes sense
134980	137420	to take the train rather than the plane.
137420	142380	Trips like Guangzhou to Changsha, a distance of 350 miles, take an hour by plane or two
142380	144580	hours and twenty minutes by train.
144580	148620	When factoring in the time it takes to check in, go through security, and board, it absolutely
148620	152820	makes sense to go by train when traveling between these two cities even without considering
152820	155960	that the high-speed train is cheaper than flying.
155960	159700	High-speed rail even makes sense in China on longer routes where it wouldn't in other
159700	160700	countries.
160700	164420	Beijing and Shanghai, for example, are about 650 miles apart.
164420	168020	Normally, that would be too far for high-speed rail to make sense.
168020	173100	Paris and Barcelona, for example, are 500 miles apart—closer than Beijing and Shanghai—but
173100	178360	only two high-speed trains a day run between the two cities compared to about 20 flights.
178360	182540	Between Beijing and Shanghai, on the other hand, about 50 flights run per day compared
182540	184540	to 41 trains.
184540	188420	Considering the trains carry far more people each—up to 1,200—trains are therefore
188420	192000	the dominant means of transport between these two cities.
192000	194700	There are a few differences between these two routes.
194700	199820	For one, while Beijing-Shanghai by train takes 4 hours and 28 minutes, Paris-Barcelona, despite
199820	203880	being a shorter distance, takes a longer 6 hours and 25 minutes.
203880	206540	The other factor, though, is about the competition.
206540	210800	Europe has an efficient air transport network dominated by budget airlines that are often
210800	212540	far cheaper than trains.
212540	217020	You can find tickets for flights between Paris and Barcelona for as little as $12 while the
217020	220640	cheapest Beijing-Shanghai flights go for $74.
220640	223860	Air travel within China is also far from efficient.
223860	228220	China Southern, China Eastern, and Air China, the three largest Chinese airlines, arrive
228220	233500	on time an average of 67, 66, and 63% of the time respectively.
233500	237720	A big reason for this is that there's just not enough room in the skies.
237720	241720	A majority of China's airspace is military controlled meaning that there are just these
241720	246980	narrow flight corridors that account for 30% of airspace where civilian planes can fly.
246980	251380	With tons of planes and not much room to fly, planes are frequently delayed by air traffic
251380	255360	control to wait for the airspace to clear up which leads to the abysmal on-time readings
255360	257080	of the country's airlines.
257080	261320	While the Beijing-Shanghai flight takes only two hours, the potential of delays, along
261320	265700	with all the other factors that make air travel slower, help make the train the popular means
265700	268300	of transport on this longer route.
268300	271120	Other train routes in China, though, make less sense.
271120	276580	For example, in 2014, the new high-speed train line opened between Langzhou and Irimchi.
276580	279700	These two cities are relatively small by China standards.
279700	284380	They both have a population of 3.5 million and between them are only small towns.
284380	288940	They're also not close—about 1,000 miles separate them.
288940	292580	This project could therefore be compared to building a high-speed train from Denver to
292580	297640	Seattle—they're modestly sized cities a long ways apart with nothing big in between.
297640	301280	Some people would use it, but it wouldn't make any financial sense.
301280	305600	In China, Langzhou and Irimchi are not small cities but there's really nothing big in
305600	309700	between and, at that distance, there's no sense not flying.
309700	314920	The Langzhou-Irimchi high-speed train takes 11 hours compared to the 2.5 hour flight and
314920	320280	the construction cost of that line was $20 billion meaning that, if every seat on every
320280	324880	train was filled tickets would still have to cost $400 each way just to make back the
324880	327520	construction cost in 30 years.
327520	332760	In reality, tickets cost about $80 and trains are far from full meaning that this rail line
332760	335720	is just insanely far from profitable.
335720	339780	The ticket revenues from these trains reportedly don't even cover the cost of electricity
339780	343520	for the line let alone construction and other operating costs.
343520	347820	So why would the Chinese government sink so much money into something that has no prospects
347820	349880	of really ever making money?
349880	351480	Well, politics.
351480	354360	Irimchi is the capital of the Xinjiang province.
354360	360080	While 92% of China's population is Han Chinese, the Xinjiang province is primarily Uyghur—one
360080	364220	of the minority ethnic groups of China—and there has been an ongoing, fairly strong separatist
364220	368080	movement by the Uyghurs from China that has often turned violent.
368080	372000	The central government in Beijing, however, wants the Xinjiang province to be just as
372000	375920	integrated as the rest of the country and has tried a variety of methods to force this
375920	380560	including moving Han Chinese into the region and the imprisonment of Uyghurs in so-called
380560	382100	re-education camps.
382100	386320	The high-speed train is just the most recent tactic to bring Xinjiang closer to Beijing
386320	387980	and this is no secret.
387980	391620	The central government is fully upfront in saying that the line was built to promote,
391620	393940	as they call it, ethnic unity.
393940	398340	This isn't the first time that they've used this tactic of railroad politics—Tibet,
398340	402700	a region even better known than Xinjiang for its independence movement, was the last region
402700	406900	in China not to have a railway due to its small population and intense terrain.
406900	410580	The central government still wanted to build one, though, to bring it closer to the rest
410580	413080	of the country and so they did.
413080	417900	Trains now run directly from Beijing to Lhasa, Tibet in 47 hours on the highest elevation
417900	419920	rail line in the world.
419920	425460	These trains reach an elevation of 16,640 feet—so high that passengers have to use
425460	427540	direct oxygen supply.
427540	431100	Even the train to Hong Kong serves the central government's goal of further integrating
431100	435540	Hong Kong, which is an autonomous special administrative region, into mainland China.
435540	439620	While high-speed trains to Hong Kong certainly do make a lot more sense than trains to the
439620	443660	Xinjiang province, many Hong Kongers have not greeted the new service kindly as they
443660	448020	view it as an encroachment on the autonomy guaranteed to them by Hong Kong basic law.
448020	451340	The most controversial part has not been the fact that there's a train but rather that
451340	455340	the station in Hong Kong includes an area that is effectively now part of mainland China
455340	459460	since people pass through border controls before boarding the train in Hong Kong.
459460	463820	Just like any country, what having a high-speed, efficient rail network in China is doing is
463820	467240	bringing the country together and making it stronger even if it's bringing together
467240	469500	people that want to stay apart.
469500	473480	No matter their motives, it's clear that China is building their high-speed rail network
473480	475840	more efficiently than any other country.
475840	480040	To compare, this is the plan for California's high-speed rail line from San Francisco to
480040	481280	the Los Angeles area.
481280	486720	It's currently in very early phases of construction and is expected to open by 2029.
486720	489960	Of course, that means that the time it will take for California's high-speed rail network
489960	493580	to go from this to this is the same as the time it took China's high-speed rail network
493580	497800	to go from this to this but, the main thing to look at is cost.
497800	503320	This California network is expected to cost $77 billion and is 520 miles long meaning
503320	507200	that it will cost $148 million per mile to build.
507200	511700	China, on the other hand, is building their network at a cost of only $30 million per
511700	512700	mile.
512700	516120	Of course, labor costs are lower in China and their network crosses more rural areas
516120	520240	where land acquisition costs are lower but, what's more meaningful is that they've
520240	523980	turned building high-speed rail into almost an assembly line process where they can mass
523980	527820	produce even the most expensive elements like viaducts and tunnels.
527820	532340	In true Chinese fashion, with scale they're making high-speed cheaper.
532340	535780	The big difference between China and a lot of the western world, particularly countries
535780	540320	like the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, is that high-speed rail is at
540320	542500	the top of the government's priorities.
542500	547260	Unsurprisingly given their government structure, in many ways, China has placed social benefit,
547260	551140	at least by the definition of the central government, ahead of profitability when developing
551140	553100	their high-speed rail network.
553100	557440	High-speed rail lines just aren't as profitable as other means of transport like planes but
557440	561780	they are undoubtedly better for countries so you have to consider the social benefit
561780	563820	when looking at their overall profitability.
563820	568260	For the San Francisco to LA high-speed rail route, for example, one study found that the
568260	573300	social benefit derived from lower carbon emissions, higher worker productivity, and reduced casualties
573300	578400	from fewer people on the road would be equivalent to about $440 million per year.
578400	582460	As it turns out, this is almost the exact amount that the state will have to subsidize
582460	584220	the line for it to break even.
584220	588580	The China Railway Corporation, a state-owned enterprise, is actually slightly profitable
588580	592440	although it does have huge amounts of debts and is helped by government subsidies.
592440	595380	The benefit to the Chinese people, though, is huge.
595380	599020	The high-speed rail allows those who can't afford to live in the most expensive cities
599020	603580	like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou to easily commute from cheaper suburbs by high-speed
603580	604580	rail.
604580	609340	Thanks to the high-speed rail, there are now 75 million people who can commute to Shanghai
609340	610340	in under an hour.
610340	615220	It is growing what are already some of the largest cities and, when it comes to cities,
615220	616860	size is strength.
616860	620540	These lines connecting the east's largest cities are some of the most profitable rail
620540	625020	lines in the world and they're making living and working in China easier but the question
625020	629140	is, when we look back decades from now, whether the high-speed trains to smaller cities will
629140	630400	have made sense.
630400	634320	Out of a desire to keep the lines going straight between the big cities, the stops for smaller
634320	638580	cities are often out in the countryside dozens of miles away from the city core.
638580	642740	The high-speed station for Hanyang, for example, a smaller city of only a million, is about
642740	645780	a 45 minute drive east of the city center.
645780	650140	The hope is that new development will spring up around the stations but this network structure,
650140	654640	even if it saves time on the train, wastes time before and after which degrades the benefit
654640	656300	of high-speed rail.
656300	660700	In all, China is really the first country to have experimented with long-distance, high-speed
660700	663200	rail through less dense areas in its west.
663200	667440	In the east, though, these trains are enlarging the country's economic power—it's just
667440	672240	one of the many factors speeding up China's catch-up with the world's richest countries.
672240	675720	Even though China is building these trains for less and innovating on the construction
675720	680280	of high-speed rail, the real reason why China is so good at building railways is because
680280	685000	they have the one thing that almost every other country lacks—the political will for
685000	687400	high-speed trains.
687400	690280	Whenever I'm looking to launch something new, one of the first things I think about
690280	691980	is how to present it online.
691980	697660	I think about domain names, emails, websites, and where I always go to do all that is Squarespace.
