00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
There's no one definition to what makes something a country.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.760
What decides if a country is a country is essentially whether or not other countries

00:11.760 --> 00:14.080
agree that the country is indeed a country.

00:14.080 --> 00:19.680
For this reason, counts of the number of countries in the world range from 189 to 196.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.040
Each country decides which other countries they recognize.

00:22.040 --> 00:26.680
If 100 UN member states suddenly recognize your basement as its own country, then it

00:26.680 --> 00:30.240
generally would be accepted that your basement is its own country.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.940
There are, however, a number of steps that any prospective country founder needs to take

00:33.940 --> 00:38.020
if they want to have any shot at gaining international recognition.

00:38.020 --> 00:41.600
The first thing anyone needs to begin creating a country is a piece of land.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.240
One way to get it is to steal it.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.800
Of course, this involves having enough guns to defend your territory.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.380
This would also be problematic for when your country gets to the stage where its legitimacy

00:50.380 --> 00:54.880
is reviewed by other nations, but this method has worked before.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.640
The easier method is to claim unclaimed land.

00:57.640 --> 01:01.760
However, with the advent of satellite imaging and modern cartography, there really are no

01:01.760 --> 01:05.040
islands or large pieces of territory that are not known.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.000
Despite this, there is a small number of places not governed or claimed by any recognized

01:10.000 --> 01:11.400
government.

01:11.400 --> 01:16.240
One of the better known recent claims happened in an area unclaimed by both Croatia and Serbia

01:16.240 --> 01:19.700
along the Danube River, the border between the two countries.

01:19.700 --> 01:23.840
This micronation, known as Liberland, has not received any international recognition

01:23.840 --> 01:28.840
and has been denounced by a number of nations, but it still affirms its legitimacy based

01:28.840 --> 01:31.560
off the lack of previous claim to its land.

01:31.560 --> 01:36.240
Its land is actually 17 times larger than the land of the smallest recognized country,

01:36.240 --> 01:37.600
the Vatican.

01:37.600 --> 01:42.040
Serbia did agree that Liberland did not infringe upon its territory, but also dismissed the

01:42.040 --> 01:44.380
endeavor as frivolous.

01:44.380 --> 01:47.880
Other new nations have had more success at international recognition.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.580
Most of these are partially recognized nations that split away from a more recognized state

01:51.580 --> 01:54.240
with the backing of the people within the territory.

01:54.240 --> 01:58.840
An example of this is South Ossetia, which split away from Georgia in 1990 and is currently

01:58.840 --> 02:03.060
recognized by Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Nauru.

02:03.060 --> 02:08.260
Probably the best known and most hotly contested recently formed nation is the state of Palestine.

02:08.260 --> 02:14.280
136 nations recognized the Palestine and in 2012 it was designated by the United Nations

02:14.280 --> 02:17.000
as a non-member observer state.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.700
One other option for unclaimed land is Antarctica.

02:19.700 --> 02:24.620
A large section of land known as the Merry Birdland has not been claimed by any recognized

02:24.620 --> 02:25.840
nation.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.020
One issue with this option is the United Nations' Antarctica treaty, which states that no new

02:30.020 --> 02:34.740
claim or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty shall be asserted

02:34.740 --> 02:37.100
while the present treaty is in force.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.460
There are claims that pre-exist this treaty by several different nations, although the

02:41.460 --> 02:45.700
legitimacy of these claims is disputed given the treaty.

02:45.700 --> 02:49.980
In addition to the Antarctic treaty issue, establishing a sovereign nation in Antarctica

02:49.980 --> 02:53.520
would be difficult because of the next step in the process.

02:53.520 --> 02:58.660
A nation is created to serve its people and without people there is no nation.

02:58.660 --> 03:02.720
There are always people in Antarctica, but these people do not constitute a permanent

03:02.720 --> 03:07.740
population because they are primarily there for research or tourism and none stay in Antarctica

03:07.740 --> 03:09.620
for more than a few years.

03:09.620 --> 03:14.420
Interestingly, 11 babies have been born in Antarctica, but they generally have taken

03:14.420 --> 03:17.580
the citizenship of their parents' countries.

03:17.580 --> 03:21.500
A permanent population is one of the most basic qualifiers for statehood.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.660
A sustainable independent nation would be near impossible in Antarctica.

03:25.660 --> 03:30.420
Any settlement would have no real economy and no way to naturally produce food.

03:30.420 --> 03:35.420
However, there are talks of Antarctica having oil and, if this is the case, a sovereign

03:35.420 --> 03:39.740
and potentially prosperous nation could be established in the hostile environment, much

03:39.740 --> 03:42.380
like the United Arab Emirates.

03:42.380 --> 03:47.060
Similar to the dozens of Antarctic micronation claims, Liberland struggles with a lack of

03:47.060 --> 03:48.720
permanent population.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.480
The founders' attempts to re-enter the territory have been blocked by both Serbia

03:52.480 --> 03:54.020
and Croatia.

03:54.020 --> 03:58.140
At this point, it seems unlikely that a permanent population will be established in the near

03:58.140 --> 04:03.220
future and for this reason, the future of Liberland is bleak.

04:03.220 --> 04:07.780
A well-formed government is probably the most important aspect dictating the success of

04:07.780 --> 04:08.780
your new country.

04:09.180 --> 04:12.420
There are tons of forms of government, but considering you're forming this country

04:12.420 --> 04:16.780
in the 25th century, you're likely to base the government on John Locke's principles

04:16.780 --> 04:17.780
of government.

04:17.780 --> 04:23.380
Locke's principles essentially say that, in nature, everybody has the right to life,

04:23.380 --> 04:26.300
health, liberty, or possessions.

04:26.300 --> 04:30.940
You might notice a similarity between this and another famous document.

04:30.940 --> 04:35.620
According to Locke, in a natural society that is without a government, these rights are

04:35.620 --> 04:39.420
not protected because there is no higher power to do so.

04:39.420 --> 04:43.540
So in exchange for taking away part of these rights, for example liberty when in prison

04:43.540 --> 04:48.740
or property when taxed, the government acts to protect the very same rights.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.100
Locke also states that government only works when there is a common belief in the abstract

04:53.100 --> 04:57.800
idea or illusion of government, and therefore a government can only really exist when the

04:57.800 --> 04:59.860
people are behind it.

04:59.860 --> 05:05.480
This is the reason that autocratic or absolutist governments rarely work in modern society.

05:05.480 --> 05:09.480
So now keeping these principles in mind, you need a constitution.

05:09.480 --> 05:13.700
Every single recognized country in the world either has a constitution or some substitution

05:13.700 --> 05:14.720
to it.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.840
This is not a complicated process so I won't go into too much detail, but essentially any

05:18.840 --> 05:23.240
country must have a set of laws, principles, and entities that make up the country and

05:23.240 --> 05:27.080
the constitution works to define and specify these.

05:27.080 --> 05:29.800
This is where all your work comes under scrutiny.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.280
Gaining international recognition is by far the most difficult step in the country creating

05:34.280 --> 05:35.280
process.

05:35.280 --> 05:40.360
It takes potentially hundreds of years for new countries to be fully or near fully recognized.

05:40.360 --> 05:44.560
Chances are that unless you have an overwhelming backing from the people within your country,

05:44.560 --> 05:49.840
a good reason for the establishment of your new nation, absolutely undisputed territory,

05:49.840 --> 05:54.600
and a well balanced democratic government, you won't be recognized by any UN member

05:54.600 --> 05:55.600
states.

05:55.600 --> 06:01.180
The chances of a new, well recognized nation outside of Africa or the Balkans is unlikely.

06:01.180 --> 06:05.820
The governments are too well established or stable outside of these areas.

06:05.820 --> 06:11.200
The final step to gain undisputed recognition is to be admitted to the United Nations.

06:11.200 --> 06:16.260
Any application is reviewed by the Security Council, composed of China, France, the Russian

06:16.260 --> 06:20.320
Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of

06:20.320 --> 06:23.480
America, and a rotating group of 10 others.

06:23.480 --> 06:28.000
If 10 of the 15 vote in favor of your country, congratulations, you've just joined the

06:28.000 --> 06:29.260
United Nations.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.820
By most metrics, you're now a country.

06:31.820 --> 06:36.280
Of course, other United Nations members still can fail to recognize you, and there are plenty

06:36.280 --> 06:41.360
of UN member states that are not fully recognized, however, that's a topic for another time.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.940
So good luck with your new country.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.380
Thanks for watching, and see you next time.

06:45.380 --> 06:51.220
The 8.9 mile gap between the European and African continent known as the Strait of Gibraltar

06:51.220 --> 06:54.580
is home to multiple strange territories and borders.

06:54.580 --> 06:59.900
On the European side, there's a 2.6 square mile British overseas territory named Gibraltar.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.220
This means that Britain shares a small land border with Spain.
