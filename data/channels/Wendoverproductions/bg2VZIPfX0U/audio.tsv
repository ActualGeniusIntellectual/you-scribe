0	8560	There's no one definition to what makes something a country.
8560	11760	What decides if a country is a country is essentially whether or not other countries
11760	14080	agree that the country is indeed a country.
14080	19680	For this reason, counts of the number of countries in the world range from 189 to 196.
19680	22040	Each country decides which other countries they recognize.
22040	26680	If 100 UN member states suddenly recognize your basement as its own country, then it
26680	30240	generally would be accepted that your basement is its own country.
30240	33940	There are, however, a number of steps that any prospective country founder needs to take
33940	38020	if they want to have any shot at gaining international recognition.
38020	41600	The first thing anyone needs to begin creating a country is a piece of land.
41600	43240	One way to get it is to steal it.
43240	46800	Of course, this involves having enough guns to defend your territory.
46800	50380	This would also be problematic for when your country gets to the stage where its legitimacy
50380	54880	is reviewed by other nations, but this method has worked before.
54880	57640	The easier method is to claim unclaimed land.
57640	61760	However, with the advent of satellite imaging and modern cartography, there really are no
61760	65040	islands or large pieces of territory that are not known.
65040	70000	Despite this, there is a small number of places not governed or claimed by any recognized
70000	71400	government.
71400	76240	One of the better known recent claims happened in an area unclaimed by both Croatia and Serbia
76240	79700	along the Danube River, the border between the two countries.
79700	83840	This micronation, known as Liberland, has not received any international recognition
83840	88840	and has been denounced by a number of nations, but it still affirms its legitimacy based
88840	91560	off the lack of previous claim to its land.
91560	96240	Its land is actually 17 times larger than the land of the smallest recognized country,
96240	97600	the Vatican.
97600	102040	Serbia did agree that Liberland did not infringe upon its territory, but also dismissed the
102040	104380	endeavor as frivolous.
104380	107880	Other new nations have had more success at international recognition.
107880	111580	Most of these are partially recognized nations that split away from a more recognized state
111580	114240	with the backing of the people within the territory.
114240	118840	An example of this is South Ossetia, which split away from Georgia in 1990 and is currently
118840	123060	recognized by Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela, and Nauru.
123060	128260	Probably the best known and most hotly contested recently formed nation is the state of Palestine.
128260	134280	136 nations recognized the Palestine and in 2012 it was designated by the United Nations
134280	137000	as a non-member observer state.
137000	139700	One other option for unclaimed land is Antarctica.
139700	144620	A large section of land known as the Merry Birdland has not been claimed by any recognized
144620	145840	nation.
145840	150020	One issue with this option is the United Nations' Antarctica treaty, which states that no new
150020	154740	claim or enlargement of an existing claim to territorial sovereignty shall be asserted
154740	157100	while the present treaty is in force.
157100	161460	There are claims that pre-exist this treaty by several different nations, although the
161460	165700	legitimacy of these claims is disputed given the treaty.
165700	169980	In addition to the Antarctic treaty issue, establishing a sovereign nation in Antarctica
169980	173520	would be difficult because of the next step in the process.
173520	178660	A nation is created to serve its people and without people there is no nation.
178660	182720	There are always people in Antarctica, but these people do not constitute a permanent
182720	187740	population because they are primarily there for research or tourism and none stay in Antarctica
187740	189620	for more than a few years.
189620	194420	Interestingly, 11 babies have been born in Antarctica, but they generally have taken
194420	197580	the citizenship of their parents' countries.
197580	201500	A permanent population is one of the most basic qualifiers for statehood.
201500	205660	A sustainable independent nation would be near impossible in Antarctica.
205660	210420	Any settlement would have no real economy and no way to naturally produce food.
210420	215420	However, there are talks of Antarctica having oil and, if this is the case, a sovereign
215420	219740	and potentially prosperous nation could be established in the hostile environment, much
219740	222380	like the United Arab Emirates.
222380	227060	Similar to the dozens of Antarctic micronation claims, Liberland struggles with a lack of
227060	228720	permanent population.
228720	232480	The founders' attempts to re-enter the territory have been blocked by both Serbia
232480	234020	and Croatia.
234020	238140	At this point, it seems unlikely that a permanent population will be established in the near
238140	243220	future and for this reason, the future of Liberland is bleak.
243220	247780	A well-formed government is probably the most important aspect dictating the success of
247780	248780	your new country.
249180	252420	There are tons of forms of government, but considering you're forming this country
252420	256780	in the 25th century, you're likely to base the government on John Locke's principles
256780	257780	of government.
257780	263380	Locke's principles essentially say that, in nature, everybody has the right to life,
263380	266300	health, liberty, or possessions.
266300	270940	You might notice a similarity between this and another famous document.
270940	275620	According to Locke, in a natural society that is without a government, these rights are
275620	279420	not protected because there is no higher power to do so.
279420	283540	So in exchange for taking away part of these rights, for example liberty when in prison
283540	288740	or property when taxed, the government acts to protect the very same rights.
288740	293100	Locke also states that government only works when there is a common belief in the abstract
293100	297800	idea or illusion of government, and therefore a government can only really exist when the
297800	299860	people are behind it.
299860	305480	This is the reason that autocratic or absolutist governments rarely work in modern society.
305480	309480	So now keeping these principles in mind, you need a constitution.
309480	313700	Every single recognized country in the world either has a constitution or some substitution
313700	314720	to it.
314720	318840	This is not a complicated process so I won't go into too much detail, but essentially any
318840	323240	country must have a set of laws, principles, and entities that make up the country and
323240	327080	the constitution works to define and specify these.
327080	329800	This is where all your work comes under scrutiny.
329800	334280	Gaining international recognition is by far the most difficult step in the country creating
334280	335280	process.
335280	340360	It takes potentially hundreds of years for new countries to be fully or near fully recognized.
340360	344560	Chances are that unless you have an overwhelming backing from the people within your country,
344560	349840	a good reason for the establishment of your new nation, absolutely undisputed territory,
349840	354600	and a well balanced democratic government, you won't be recognized by any UN member
354600	355600	states.
355600	361180	The chances of a new, well recognized nation outside of Africa or the Balkans is unlikely.
361180	365820	The governments are too well established or stable outside of these areas.
365820	371200	The final step to gain undisputed recognition is to be admitted to the United Nations.
371200	376260	Any application is reviewed by the Security Council, composed of China, France, the Russian
376260	380320	Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of
380320	383480	America, and a rotating group of 10 others.
383480	388000	If 10 of the 15 vote in favor of your country, congratulations, you've just joined the
388000	389260	United Nations.
389260	391820	By most metrics, you're now a country.
391820	396280	Of course, other United Nations members still can fail to recognize you, and there are plenty
396280	401360	of UN member states that are not fully recognized, however, that's a topic for another time.
401360	402940	So good luck with your new country.
402940	405380	Thanks for watching, and see you next time.
405380	411220	The 8.9 mile gap between the European and African continent known as the Strait of Gibraltar
411220	414580	is home to multiple strange territories and borders.
414580	419900	On the European side, there's a 2.6 square mile British overseas territory named Gibraltar.
419900	422220	This means that Britain shares a small land border with Spain.
