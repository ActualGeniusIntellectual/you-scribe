1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
It seemed manageable at first.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,020
On the Monday before Christmas, as winter storm Elliott began to build, Southwest Airlines

3
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,360
management huddled up to formulate a plan.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,820
The following day, it went into motion.

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,280
After internal deliberation, and after informing the pilot's union, Southwest HQ began cancelling

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,840
flights in advance of the strengthening storm.

7
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,640
The notice first directed customers at these airports to check if their flight had been

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
disrupted.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,880
Then, the list of airports began to grow.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,000
So, the airlines started the process of cancelling flights by the hundreds.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As the winter storm worsened, that call proved worthwhile.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,400
In fact, with the benefit of hindsight, they didn't go far enough.

13
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,060
But the assumption that undergirded the decision to cancel, that they could process the cancellations

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:49,440
early enough for customers to pivot plans and crews to reposition for new routings,

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,200
proved utterly, devastatingly wrong.

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,680
You know the rest of the story.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,040
Temperatures plummeted, thermometers across Denver plunged 37 degrees in a single hour,

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,720
foiled travel plans ruined holidays, 5,700 flights nationwide cancelled before Christmas,

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,760
and while other carriers staggered along, Southwest crumbled into crisis, ultimately

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,600
cancelling nearly 17,000 flights and losing out on an estimated $825 million in the final

21
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,840
10 days of the year.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,000
It was the biggest meltdown of its kind.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,200
Some blamed the storm, others blamed the carriers' point-to-point model, while others still blamed

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,600
the company's culture.

25
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,600
But as time let the hot takes cool, a less exciting culprit came forward.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,180
A culprit that's hardly unique to Southwest—a culprit, in fact, that's less a bug and

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,640
more an inherent flaw within the industry.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,720
While the biggest, the meltdown wasn't the first, and while an embarrassment to Southwest

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,240
alone, it was hardly a crisis unique to the big, beloved, budget airline.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,920
For Southwest, winter storm Elliott may have set the stage for the meltdown, but it didn't

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
cause it.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,680
As much as anything, Southwest's meltdown was a function of legacy.

33
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,920
Southwest made its name as the pioneer of the low-cost business model through quick

34
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,160
turnarounds and point-to-point route networks.

35
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,320
While a typical airline will fly their plane out and right back into their hub, a given

36
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,960
day for a Southwest aircraft might start in San Diego, then continue to Sacramento, Denver,

37
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,600
and Nashville before finishing up in Tampa.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,860
Through this network structure, Southwest could offer non-stop flights where competitors

39
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,560
only had one-stops, and by exploiting this niche, grew into the world's sixth largest

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
airline.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,980
But while efficient in perfect conditions, the system becomes a liability in the event

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,880
of a delay or cancellation—pilots time out, crews don't make it to their expected destination

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,620
for the evening, and planes aren't positioned in the right place for the next day's flight.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,380
But weather and unforeseen circumstances, as they always have, exist.

45
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,800
So Southwest has tools for these situations, one of which is a GE aeronautics system called

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,280
SkySolver.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,840
Plug data into SkySolver on irregular operations, and its algorithms will, in the words of its

48
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,200
brochure, execute flight schedule changes and cancellations, conduct aircraft routing

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,360
and equipment swaps, and make fixes to crew assignments and pairings.

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,180
That means that, if a developing storm was to roll over Denver and cause Southwest to

51
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,960
cancel this inbound flight from Sacramento, on account of the risk that the plane and

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,840
crew will stay grounded by the weather, it would call on SkySolver to effectively stem

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,600
the bleeding, and make sure that problems don't cascade to impact the rest of the

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
routing.

55
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,020
Even in Sacramento, rather than heading to Denver, SkySolver might send this plane on

56
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,800
a passenger-less deadhead to Nashville, where the crew now nearing the end of their workday

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,860
could time out and hand the plane over to the next.

58
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,880
Of course, that's only the beginning—while finding the most cost-efficient solution is

59
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,080
simple in the context of this single routing, it becomes orders of magnitude more complicated

60
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,920
when considering the hundreds of additional Southwest flights passing through.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,800
Like, where to reposition this 737 that normally would have been running in and out of Denver

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,040
all afternoon that has both the space for the plane and can begin running services the

63
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
following morning?

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,800
Or, what to do with this 737 that is running flights between cities in the storm's path

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,520
and thus is at risk of getting stuck in a snowed-in airport?

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,520
And how to make sure the later legs of this routing get flown when the plane meant to

67
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,880
run it won't make it out of Denver that morning?

68
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,640
Now, SkySolver is powerful enough to run up to 300 batches of cancellations in 20 minutes,

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,400
but it does have limitations.

70
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,840
First, it creates solutions to cancellations on the assumption of a static baseline.

71
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,000
However, to figure out viable alternatives if half of Denver's flights are canceled,

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,880
it needs to know that the Sacramento to Denver flight has already been canceled, and if it

73
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,520
doesn't, or if the flight is canceled while the system is running, SkySolver solutions

74
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
become less tenable, requiring reruns or manual intervention.

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,300
Second, SkySolver is also limited by the data input into the system.

76
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,720
Some of this data comes from an internal tool of Southwests called the Baker.

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,080
Dispatch processes delays and cancellations through the Baker to reconfigure routings

78
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,280
for aircraft and passengers before the information is then plugged into SkySolver.

79
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,040
Crucially, what the Baker's data lacks is crew information—who's available where,

80
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,000
when, and for how long before they're timed out.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,220
Now, as the storm worsened and the number of cancellations increased, the limitations

82
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:59,400
of Southwests' solver collided, resulting in a massive tailspin.

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,480
With crews left out of the equation, the algorithm's output provided what it thought to be viable

84
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,920
solutions, but solutions without pilots and attendants.

85
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,920
Once these flights had to cancel close in to departure time when it became apparent

86
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,940
that they only had half of crew, everything else unraveled, as these new cancellations

87
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,360
altered SkySolver's baseline assumptions.

88
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,120
Effectively, the software's blind spot transformed the expected difficulties of a winter storm—hundreds

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,200
of flights canceled at least 24 hours out on the 20th and 21st—into a full-blown crisis

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,560
where Southwest tools worsened problems that it then tried to fix, only to worsen things

91
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,720
further.

92
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,800
Through Christmas, cancellations occurred closer and closer to departure time as pilots

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,360
arrived to planes with no flight attendants, while planes with no passengers deadheaded

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,200
on circular, nonsensical routings like this as the software essentially panicked, positioning

95
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,040
and repositioning planes only for the crew to time out and get stuck once again.

96
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,760
Finally, blind as to where their own crews were, and with flawed programs providing flawed

97
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:58,720
fixes, Southwest went manual, training volunteer staff at headquarters on how to process pilot

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
and flight attendant forms and preparing for a hard reset.

99
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,800
In the four days following Christmas, Southwest would cancel an incredible 10,700 flights,

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,640
all because the airline failed to address a weak point that they had already identified.

101
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,400
They had put too much pressure, and stacked up too much complexity, onto a fragile IT

102
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,800
system that everyone already knew needed an overhaul.

103
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,880
And yet, as the calendar flipped, as Southwest began to stabilize, and as more detailed reporting

104
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,640
on the meltdown began to emerge, a new meltdown stole the spotlight.

105
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,920
Now it was the FAA that issued a nationwide ground stop.

106
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,160
For 90 minutes, no commercial flights took off, and for the first time since 9-11, American

107
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,640
commercial aviation came to a complete standstill, all because a single software update went

108
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,760
sideways, leading to important preflight safety communications having to be relayed manually

109
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,760
until they could simply no longer keep up with the morning rush of flights.

110
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,540
And the cycle began again—upset customers, outraged press, and promises that the old

111
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,940
technology that everyone knew would fail would be looked into.

112
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,660
And this pattern didn't start with Southwest, either.

113
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,740
IT meltdowns hit British Airways in 2017, then in 2019, then again in 2022, they forced

114
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Delta to cancel thousands of flights in 2016 and 2017, they pushed American Airlines to

115
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,140
cancel over 1,000 regional flights in 2018.

116
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,860
All said they'd do better the next time, and yet all still rely on outdated, overstretched

117
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,420
IT systems that were never designed to handle the volume of industry growth in the decades

118
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,640
since their initial development.

119
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,980
But the problems of old, overstacked IT systems don't stop at the back end.

120
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,300
While customer-facing systems might look good on the surface, the most important one, the

121
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,220
very system that makes it all possible, was created as close in time to the Wright brothers'

122
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,180
first flight as to today.

123
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,140
When a traveler sees this, it may look modern, but what they're actually looking at is

124
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,700
a translation of this.

125
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,820
In the scenes, Google Flights entered a query into the Global Distribution System, an interconnected

126
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,740
set of softwares run by Amadeus, Sabre, or Travelport.

127
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:08,500
In fact, specifically it entered this, AD, to initiate an availability lookup, 08FEB

128
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,440
to indicate the date, then DENLHR to specify Denver as the origin and London as the destination.

129
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,100
This initiates a query from the GDS system to another, OAG, which essentially acts as

130
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,660
the definitive source of airline scheduling data worldwide.

131
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:28,140
The GDS then comes back and spits out two options—one by British Airways, one by United.

132
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:32,100
The strings of letters and numbers indicate availability across the different fare classes,

133
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:37,060
then the Wright side provides most other data—departure time, arrival time, aircraft type, and flight

134
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,460
duration—but the fare data is still missing.

135
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,660
For that, Google Flights needs to pick a flight, pick a fare class, then enter another query

136
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,660
for its price.

137
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,740
But the GDS doesn't have that data itself—it seeks the answer from the airline tariff publishing

138
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,740
company which, similarly to the OAG US scheduling, is the one-stop shop for pricing data used

139
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,660
by essentially every major airline globally.

140
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,500
So once again, the GDS will repackage their response into this, reiterating the flight

141
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,540
schedule, then displaying the base fare, the carrier surcharge, US passenger facility charge,

142
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:11,180
security fee, and international departure tax to give a total $630.20 one-way fare on

143
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,540
the February 8th British Airways Denver to London flight.

144
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,380
This entire process is repeated for the United option, which gives Google Flights all the

145
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,580
information necessary to populate this screen.

146
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,100
But next up is booking, and that's even more involved.

147
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,240
Regardless of where a booking takes place, with some limited exceptions, the user interface

148
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,460
is just a translation tool to input a string of commands into the GDS.

149
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,900
This sequence initiates the process of creating a Passenger Name Record, or PNR, to which

150
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:41,720
it will then input a phone number, the name of the person making the booking, then a precisely

151
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,020
formatted description of the desired flight itinerary.

152
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,460
After reconfirming availability and fare price, the GDS will then submit the PNR and return

153
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:52,460
with this—the time limit for actually paying for the booking.

154
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,980
At this point, the booking is confirmed—that seat is reserved, and will stay reserved unless

155
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,680
that payment deadline passes without payment.

156
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,940
While these days customers typically pay immediately, in the background it's rarely required, but

157
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,980
this delayed deadline gives an online travel agency like Expedia, for example, time to

158
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,600
process and verify payment from the customer before actually paying for the ticket themselves,

159
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,360
at which point it might become nonrefundable, leaving the company in a tricky spot if a

160
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,880
customer's credit card payment declines.

161
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,300
But even before paying, Expedia will close out the transaction with the GDS, therefore

162
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,920
sending the Passenger Name Record to the airline, which will respond with a modified version

163
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,560
including a confirmation number, which is then extracted and sent to the customer in

164
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,440
a flashy, well-formatted email.

165
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,240
The GDS, and its associated systems, were revolutionary for the airline industry.

166
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,980
Not only did they make reservations a far less labor-intensive process, they made essentially

167
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,380
every airline reservation system interoperable with each other.

168
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,740
These days it's fairly simple for airlines to sell tickets involving other airlines—they're

169
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,700
all using the same GDS already, so the way United's internal systems interpret and

170
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,020
modify a PNR is the same way Lufthansa's would.

171
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:01,700
Theoretically, United could sell you an itinerary connecting onto an American Airlines flight—they

172
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,380
wouldn't because they don't have a commercial partnership with the airline, but from a technical

173
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,340
perspective there's nothing stopping them, and if something goes wrong and your United

174
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:14,100
flight cancels, the airline can and occasionally will rebook flights onto American, Delta,

175
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,780
and others using this system.

176
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,100
But while the GDS was revolutionary, it hardly still is today.

177
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,320
In fact, at airports around the world, when you step up to a reservations agent, chances

178
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,620
are the other side of their screen looks like this.

179
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,080
Still today, in 2023, the GDS has operated as a command-line interface, the way computers

180
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,340
worked before graphical user interfaces were popularized in the 80s.

181
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,620
American interfaces aren't in and of themselves an issue, but in context, the difficulty is

182
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,460
that using them requires legitimate creativity and skill.

183
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:51,220
Let's say, for example, a customer is here in Denver, headed to Zurich, and their 1.40

184
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,340
pm flight to Chicago to connect onto the 7.10 overnight to Zurich just cancelled, meaning

185
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,260
they won't make their connection.

186
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:01,220
A rebooking agent would start by querying the GDS for the next available itinerary between

187
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,420
the two cities, and they would see there's a viable one connecting onto a 7.20 pm Swiss

188
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,380
Air flight out of LAX, but the problem is that the only two flights to LA that would

189
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,420
make that, at 1.36 and 3.55, are already oversold, meaning there's no seat available for the

190
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,660
stranded passenger.

191
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,900
So, according to the GDS, it's impossible to get that passenger on their way to Zurich

192
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,940
until the next day.

193
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,640
But just because the GDS says it's impossible doesn't mean it actually is.

194
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,500
For example, an experienced rebooking agent would know that United also flies to John

195
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,780
Wayne Airport in Orange County, about an hour's drive from LAX, so if desperate,

196
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,940
the passenger could fly to there, take a taxi to LAX, then make their overnight flight to

197
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Switzerland.

198
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,940
The GDS can't offer this as an option because it's not one that the airline would sell,

199
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,780
so it's not in the system, but with this knowledge, an agent could individually book

200
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,380
seats for each leg, then string them together into an itinerary in the PNR.

201
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,200
The GDS also would know that United's 11.45 am LAX-bound flight was delayed until 1.30,

202
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,200
meaning this passenger could still take that and make the connection.

203
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,180
It also wouldn't suggest taking American's 4.10 pm flight to LAX as an option because

204
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,680
Swiss Air and American don't typically ticket together, but in this exceptional circumstance,

205
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,540
United could buy the stranded passenger a ticket on American through the GDS to continue

206
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,200
their journey on Swiss.

207
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,240
And this is only the tip of the iceberg—there are endless tricks to working with the GDS

208
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,920
to solve problems, but experience is needed to know the right technique.

209
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,240
The horrible truth this presents, for both passengers and airlines, is that, constantly,

210
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,760
passengers are getting stranded when they don't have to be—it's down to the luck

211
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,820
of the draw.

212
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,900
Is the rebooking agent you're walking up to one that's worked there for 30 years

213
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,120
and knows the GDS like the back of their hand, or have they just finished the limited required

214
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,120
training to complete those simplest tasks?

215
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,640
For passengers, this increases the frequency of getting stranded on the road, and for airlines,

216
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,440
this increases the cost borne from issuing meal vouchers, booking accommodation, and

217
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,240
paying for delay compensation when passengers don't get to their destination on time.

218
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,400
And the limitations of the GDS not only create additional costs, but also prevent potential

219
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
revenue.

220
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,920
For example, Air New Zealand developed an innovative product where three successive

221
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,020
economy-class seats can be transformed into a short, lie-flat bed called skycouch.

222
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:19,100
That means that those seats can be sold individually, as usual, or as a set of three to one or two

223
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,520
passengers.

224
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,960
This sort of optionality breaks the GDS—it doesn't have a way of properly communicating

225
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,880
or reserving these sorts of transformable seats, so on the GDS, skycouch seats are just

226
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,820
displayed as occupied, regardless of whether they actually are.

227
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,240
In order to book them, one has to go directly to the Air New Zealand website.

228
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,080
For the airline, this leaves plenty of potential revenue on the table.

229
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,080
For example, a huge portion of the airline's traffic is ticketed through United, since

230
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,800
United is a major partner that feeds inbound traffic from across the US to Air New Zealand's

231
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,640
long-haul flights out of LA, San Francisco, Houston, and Chicago.

232
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,840
Those passengers can book and check in exclusively with United, meaning they would never have

233
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,000
even had the chance to pay Air New Zealand for a skycouch, and it's the same with passengers

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,860
who booked through other airlines or online travel agencies.

235
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,560
Airlines have been complaining about the GDS system for decades, and so there are an increasing

236
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:14,200
number of technical solutions and workarounds to the GDS's constraints, but even those

237
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
have their problems.

238
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,780
For example, Iota introduced the New Distribution Capability Standard, which allows for more

239
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,700
complex back-end communication, but rather than serving as the solution to the GDS's

240
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,180
shortcomings, it more so demonstrates what's truly at the root of the problem.

241
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,940
162 airlines, travel agencies, system providers, and others are certified by Iota as having

242
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,220
properly integrated this new standard into their systems—or at least, part of it.

243
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,540
The core functions have pretty good uptake—for example, 156 of those have incorporated the

244
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,020
NDC standard that allows for shopping for flights—but then you get to the more novel

245
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,020
functions.

246
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,720
SHPAN2 is a standard that allows for the sale of increasingly common unbundled anciliaries

247
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,780
like inflight Wi-Fi, lounge access, priority boarding, and more, meaning that, theoretically,

248
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,320
it allows someone booking through Expedia to buy that inflight Wi-Fi right in their

249
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,560
checkout flow.

250
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,220
But only 51 of the 162 are certified on this capability.

251
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,860
And then you get into the really specialized stuff—NDC has enabled airlines to have interoperable

252
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,220
dynamic pricing systems, meaning, rather than working with the constraints of the GDS

253
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,460
and ATP Co., which only allow for price updates a certain number of times per day, each fare

254
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,740
would be customized for each individual consumer based on an algorithm's estimation of their

255
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,180
price sensitivity.

256
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,340
But to date, not a single airline is certified on this already-existing, revenue-generating

257
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,840
standard.

258
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,380
This is a familiar refrain.

259
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,820
Airlines ask for more advanced systems, more advanced systems are developed, then airlines

260
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,060
don't use the more advanced systems because they decide the cost it would take to integrate

261
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,860
them isn't worth it.

262
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,500
And some airlines are going further, not only failing to implement new interoperable systems,

263
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,260
but rejecting their use altogether.

264
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,700
For example, if you search on Expedia for an itinerary between Denver and Long Beach,

265
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,780
it'll tell you the best option is a one-stop trip through Phoenix on American, but there

266
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,540
are actually three non-stop flights a day on that route.

267
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,100
The problem, though, is that they're Southwest flights, and with limited exception, Southwest

268
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,740
does not allow for booking through the GDS, meaning Expedia has no way to book a customer

269
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,220
a ticket on the airline.

270
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,200
Meanwhile, on Google Flights, which focuses on directing people where to book rather than

271
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,700
booking itself, you can find Southwest schedules, which are filed with OAG, but you can't

272
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,540
find fares—with no GDS sales, there's no reason to distribute fare information.

273
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,940
This all means that nearly all Southwest bookings are done on Southwest's website, but the

274
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,220
airline can customize and revenue-optimize the booking process as they wish.

275
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,940
The upsells are everywhere, before confirming a fare when it gets a pop-up outlining the

276
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,700
benefits of the next most expensive fare class.

277
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,540
On the following screens, there's the same upsell again, an offer for a $200 credit in

278
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,500
return for signing up for their credit card, and an option to pay for early check-in, guaranteeing

279
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,920
one of the best boarding positions.

280
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,880
These upsells matter.

281
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,780
In 2021, ancillary fees made up more than $4 billion in revenue for Southwest, and that

282
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,800
ancillary revenue is raised when customers book directly and are offered all the upsells.

283
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,140
And in addition to increased revenue, direct booking costs less—no paying for developers

284
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,040
to integrate their systems with others, no paying GDS fees, no paying commissions to

285
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,820
Expedia and others.

286
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,700
Following Southwest's lead, GDS non-participation by budget airlines is downright common these

287
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,080
days, and the full-service network carriers are increasingly working around it to strike

288
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,640
up direct business and system relationships with major sales channels and partners.

289
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,040
But this is fragmenting the industry.

290
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,100
Comments are innovating, which is exactly what the industry should be doing, but through

291
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,720
this individual innovation, are losing the collective interoperability that has led to

292
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,880
the globally seamless travel experience that customers have come to expect.

293
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,120
It's almost analogous to a reverse tragedy of the commons.

294
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,800
Each individual node in the system would grow their revenue by investing in better interoperable

295
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,680
systems, but only if every other node did too.

296
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,560
If only one node invests, they'll have spent money to create interoperability, but still

297
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:08,600
lack partners to interoperate with, meaning no revenue impact and a negative cost impact.

298
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,520
So, in this context, each node is actually incentivized to reduce interoperability to

299
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,020
push consumers towards their own systems, which are better designed to increase per-customer

300
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,200
revenue than the interoperable ones.

301
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,380
It's a strategic stalemate.

302
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,120
And this can explain the broader issue as well—there's a strategic IT stalemate.

303
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,560
When every airline's IT is equally bad, there's little competitive incentive to

304
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,720
improve it.

305
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:38,240
Why invest to improve to a level that the public doesn't even know is possible?

306
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Globally, the airline industry has just settled on a culture of good enough.

307
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,680
The problem, from our outside perspective, is that airlines essentially act as public

308
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,200
utilities these days.

309
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,620
They're the only practical means of long-haul travel, and are also the only practical means

310
00:19:54,620 --> 00:20:00,220
for medium-haul travel in areas of North America, Russia, Australia, and other larger, less-dense

311
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,220
countries.

312
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,860
Airlines slow down, people slow down, and therefore, economies slow down.

313
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,820
The US recognizes this fact by subsidizing the construction and maintenance of airports,

314
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,220
and even more strongly by subsidizing airlines to fly to rural and remote communities, under

315
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,820
the thesis that a lack of air travel options would hold back their economies.

316
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,560
And countries also recognize this preemptively, historically treating the earliest airlines

317
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,660
as government services and running them as state-owned enterprises, but in the century

318
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:31,460
sense, the trend has been thoroughly towards privatization, meaning the only real obligation

319
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,900
is to the shareholder.

320
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,460
So this is one of those all-too-common scenarios where there is a stark difference between

321
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,820
what's good for the shareholder, and what's good for the world.

322
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,060
Therefore, it's pretty simple—regulators need to decide whether airlines' IT antiquity

323
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,820
is a problem for the public, and if so, do something about it.

324
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,380
As many of you know, I travel constantly—I'm on the road more than I'm at home, and one

325
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,220
thing that I've found is crucial to making that level of travel sustainable is having

326
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,460
self-improvement routines that I can do both at home and on the road.

327
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,060
That means going to the gym, on runs, and a less common one that I've really grown

328
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,020
to love is using our sponsor, Brilliant.org.

329
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,980
That's because Brilliant has these really interesting, well-designed courses on STEM

330
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,340
subjects that probably seem way too hard to learn independently.

331
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,320
Crucially, these courses are designed so you can move through them in bite-sized chunks,

332
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,800
so while I'm at home, I might make some progress learning gravitational physics while

333
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,940
waiting for a call to start, while on the road, you might find me doing the same while

334
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,120
waiting for the plane to board.

335
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,080
And what's amazing about it is that, if you just do that enough times, suddenly you

336
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,720
understand how foundational and advanced math, or AI, data science, or neural networks work.

337
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:43,240
Obviously, these subjects are complex, but Brilliant makes learning them straightforward

338
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,800
by breaking them down into their intuitive principles, and by making it so you can learn

339
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,300
anywhere and anytime thanks to their mobile app.

340
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,200
And they have over 60 of these courses—few enough that you know they're really working

341
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,440
on making each one amazing, while many enough that they feature all the major STEM subjects

342
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
that you'd want to learn.

343
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,360
I think it's so cool that you can learn such big, complex subjects independently at

344
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,700
your own pace, so if you agree, you can try everything Brilliant has to offer, free, for

345
