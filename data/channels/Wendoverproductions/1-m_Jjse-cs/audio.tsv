0	3680	It seemed manageable at first.
3680	8020	On the Monday before Christmas, as winter storm Elliott began to build, Southwest Airlines
8020	11360	management huddled up to formulate a plan.
11360	13820	The following day, it went into motion.
13820	18280	After internal deliberation, and after informing the pilot's union, Southwest HQ began cancelling
18280	20840	flights in advance of the strengthening storm.
20840	24640	The notice first directed customers at these airports to check if their flight had been
24640	25640	disrupted.
25640	28880	Then, the list of airports began to grow.
29200	33000	So, the airlines started the process of cancelling flights by the hundreds.
33000	36000	As the winter storm worsened, that call proved worthwhile.
36000	40400	In fact, with the benefit of hindsight, they didn't go far enough.
40400	45060	But the assumption that undergirded the decision to cancel, that they could process the cancellations
45060	49440	early enough for customers to pivot plans and crews to reposition for new routings,
49440	53200	proved utterly, devastatingly wrong.
53200	54680	You know the rest of the story.
54680	59040	Temperatures plummeted, thermometers across Denver plunged 37 degrees in a single hour,
59040	63720	foiled travel plans ruined holidays, 5,700 flights nationwide cancelled before Christmas,
63720	67760	and while other carriers staggered along, Southwest crumbled into crisis, ultimately
67760	74600	cancelling nearly 17,000 flights and losing out on an estimated $825 million in the final
74600	75840	10 days of the year.
75840	79000	It was the biggest meltdown of its kind.
79000	83200	Some blamed the storm, others blamed the carriers' point-to-point model, while others still blamed
83200	84600	the company's culture.
84600	89600	But as time let the hot takes cool, a less exciting culprit came forward.
89600	95180	A culprit that's hardly unique to Southwest—a culprit, in fact, that's less a bug and
95180	98640	more an inherent flaw within the industry.
98640	102720	While the biggest, the meltdown wasn't the first, and while an embarrassment to Southwest
102720	108240	alone, it was hardly a crisis unique to the big, beloved, budget airline.
108240	112920	For Southwest, winter storm Elliott may have set the stage for the meltdown, but it didn't
112920	113920	cause it.
114240	118680	As much as anything, Southwest's meltdown was a function of legacy.
118680	121920	Southwest made its name as the pioneer of the low-cost business model through quick
121920	124160	turnarounds and point-to-point route networks.
124160	128320	While a typical airline will fly their plane out and right back into their hub, a given
128320	132960	day for a Southwest aircraft might start in San Diego, then continue to Sacramento, Denver,
132960	135600	and Nashville before finishing up in Tampa.
135600	138860	Through this network structure, Southwest could offer non-stop flights where competitors
138860	143560	only had one-stops, and by exploiting this niche, grew into the world's sixth largest
143560	144560	airline.
144560	148980	But while efficient in perfect conditions, the system becomes a liability in the event
148980	153880	of a delay or cancellation—pilots time out, crews don't make it to their expected destination
153880	158620	for the evening, and planes aren't positioned in the right place for the next day's flight.
158620	163380	But weather and unforeseen circumstances, as they always have, exist.
163380	168800	So Southwest has tools for these situations, one of which is a GE aeronautics system called
168800	170280	SkySolver.
170280	174840	Plug data into SkySolver on irregular operations, and its algorithms will, in the words of its
174840	178200	brochure, execute flight schedule changes and cancellations, conduct aircraft routing
178200	181360	and equipment swaps, and make fixes to crew assignments and pairings.
181360	185180	That means that, if a developing storm was to roll over Denver and cause Southwest to
185180	188960	cancel this inbound flight from Sacramento, on account of the risk that the plane and
188960	192840	crew will stay grounded by the weather, it would call on SkySolver to effectively stem
192840	196600	the bleeding, and make sure that problems don't cascade to impact the rest of the
196600	197600	routing.
197600	201020	Even in Sacramento, rather than heading to Denver, SkySolver might send this plane on
201020	204800	a passenger-less deadhead to Nashville, where the crew now nearing the end of their workday
204800	207860	could time out and hand the plane over to the next.
207860	211880	Of course, that's only the beginning—while finding the most cost-efficient solution is
211880	216080	simple in the context of this single routing, it becomes orders of magnitude more complicated
216080	219920	when considering the hundreds of additional Southwest flights passing through.
219920	223800	Like, where to reposition this 737 that normally would have been running in and out of Denver
223800	228040	all afternoon that has both the space for the plane and can begin running services the
228040	229040	following morning?
229040	232800	Or, what to do with this 737 that is running flights between cities in the storm's path
232800	236520	and thus is at risk of getting stuck in a snowed-in airport?
236520	239520	And how to make sure the later legs of this routing get flown when the plane meant to
239520	241880	run it won't make it out of Denver that morning?
241880	246640	Now, SkySolver is powerful enough to run up to 300 batches of cancellations in 20 minutes,
246640	248400	but it does have limitations.
248400	252840	First, it creates solutions to cancellations on the assumption of a static baseline.
252880	256000	However, to figure out viable alternatives if half of Denver's flights are canceled,
256000	259880	it needs to know that the Sacramento to Denver flight has already been canceled, and if it
259880	263520	doesn't, or if the flight is canceled while the system is running, SkySolver solutions
263520	267120	become less tenable, requiring reruns or manual intervention.
267120	271300	Second, SkySolver is also limited by the data input into the system.
271300	275720	Some of this data comes from an internal tool of Southwests called the Baker.
275720	279080	Dispatch processes delays and cancellations through the Baker to reconfigure routings
279080	283280	for aircraft and passengers before the information is then plugged into SkySolver.
283280	288040	Crucially, what the Baker's data lacks is crew information—who's available where,
288040	291000	when, and for how long before they're timed out.
291000	295220	Now, as the storm worsened and the number of cancellations increased, the limitations
295220	299400	of Southwests' solver collided, resulting in a massive tailspin.
299400	303480	With crews left out of the equation, the algorithm's output provided what it thought to be viable
303480	306920	solutions, but solutions without pilots and attendants.
306960	309920	Once these flights had to cancel close in to departure time when it became apparent
309920	313940	that they only had half of crew, everything else unraveled, as these new cancellations
313940	316360	altered SkySolver's baseline assumptions.
316360	321120	Effectively, the software's blind spot transformed the expected difficulties of a winter storm—hundreds
321120	326200	of flights canceled at least 24 hours out on the 20th and 21st—into a full-blown crisis
326200	330560	where Southwest tools worsened problems that it then tried to fix, only to worsen things
330560	331720	further.
331720	335800	Through Christmas, cancellations occurred closer and closer to departure time as pilots
335800	339360	arrived to planes with no flight attendants, while planes with no passengers deadheaded
339360	344200	on circular, nonsensical routings like this as the software essentially panicked, positioning
344200	349040	and repositioning planes only for the crew to time out and get stuck once again.
349040	353760	Finally, blind as to where their own crews were, and with flawed programs providing flawed
353760	358720	fixes, Southwest went manual, training volunteer staff at headquarters on how to process pilot
358720	362320	and flight attendant forms and preparing for a hard reset.
362320	367800	In the four days following Christmas, Southwest would cancel an incredible 10,700 flights,
367800	371640	all because the airline failed to address a weak point that they had already identified.
371640	376400	They had put too much pressure, and stacked up too much complexity, onto a fragile IT
376400	380800	system that everyone already knew needed an overhaul.
380800	385880	And yet, as the calendar flipped, as Southwest began to stabilize, and as more detailed reporting
385880	390640	on the meltdown began to emerge, a new meltdown stole the spotlight.
390640	394920	Now it was the FAA that issued a nationwide ground stop.
394920	400160	For 90 minutes, no commercial flights took off, and for the first time since 9-11, American
400160	405640	commercial aviation came to a complete standstill, all because a single software update went
405640	409760	sideways, leading to important preflight safety communications having to be relayed manually
409760	413760	until they could simply no longer keep up with the morning rush of flights.
413760	418540	And the cycle began again—upset customers, outraged press, and promises that the old
418540	421940	technology that everyone knew would fail would be looked into.
421940	424660	And this pattern didn't start with Southwest, either.
424660	430740	IT meltdowns hit British Airways in 2017, then in 2019, then again in 2022, they forced
430740	435740	Delta to cancel thousands of flights in 2016 and 2017, they pushed American Airlines to
435740	439140	cancel over 1,000 regional flights in 2018.
439140	443860	All said they'd do better the next time, and yet all still rely on outdated, overstretched
443860	448420	IT systems that were never designed to handle the volume of industry growth in the decades
448420	450640	since their initial development.
450640	454980	But the problems of old, overstacked IT systems don't stop at the back end.
454980	459300	While customer-facing systems might look good on the surface, the most important one, the
459300	464220	very system that makes it all possible, was created as close in time to the Wright brothers'
464220	466180	first flight as to today.
466180	471140	When a traveler sees this, it may look modern, but what they're actually looking at is
471140	473700	a translation of this.
473700	478820	In the scenes, Google Flights entered a query into the Global Distribution System, an interconnected
478820	482740	set of softwares run by Amadeus, Sabre, or Travelport.
482740	488500	In fact, specifically it entered this, AD, to initiate an availability lookup, 08FEB
488500	494440	to indicate the date, then DENLHR to specify Denver as the origin and London as the destination.
494440	499100	This initiates a query from the GDS system to another, OAG, which essentially acts as
499100	502660	the definitive source of airline scheduling data worldwide.
502660	508140	The GDS then comes back and spits out two options—one by British Airways, one by United.
508140	512100	The strings of letters and numbers indicate availability across the different fare classes,
512100	517060	then the Wright side provides most other data—departure time, arrival time, aircraft type, and flight
517060	519460	duration—but the fare data is still missing.
519460	523660	For that, Google Flights needs to pick a flight, pick a fare class, then enter another query
523660	524660	for its price.
524660	528740	But the GDS doesn't have that data itself—it seeks the answer from the airline tariff publishing
528740	533740	company which, similarly to the OAG US scheduling, is the one-stop shop for pricing data used
533740	536660	by essentially every major airline globally.
536660	541500	So once again, the GDS will repackage their response into this, reiterating the flight
541500	545540	schedule, then displaying the base fare, the carrier surcharge, US passenger facility charge,
545540	551180	security fee, and international departure tax to give a total $630.20 one-way fare on
551180	554540	the February 8th British Airways Denver to London flight.
554540	558380	This entire process is repeated for the United option, which gives Google Flights all the
558420	561580	information necessary to populate this screen.
561580	565100	But next up is booking, and that's even more involved.
565100	569240	Regardless of where a booking takes place, with some limited exceptions, the user interface
569240	573460	is just a translation tool to input a string of commands into the GDS.
573460	577900	This sequence initiates the process of creating a Passenger Name Record, or PNR, to which
577900	581720	it will then input a phone number, the name of the person making the booking, then a precisely
581720	585020	formatted description of the desired flight itinerary.
585060	589460	After reconfirming availability and fare price, the GDS will then submit the PNR and return
589460	592460	with this—the time limit for actually paying for the booking.
592460	596980	At this point, the booking is confirmed—that seat is reserved, and will stay reserved unless
596980	599680	that payment deadline passes without payment.
599680	603940	While these days customers typically pay immediately, in the background it's rarely required, but
603940	607980	this delayed deadline gives an online travel agency like Expedia, for example, time to
607980	612600	process and verify payment from the customer before actually paying for the ticket themselves,
612600	616360	at which point it might become nonrefundable, leaving the company in a tricky spot if a
616360	617880	customer's credit card payment declines.
617880	622300	But even before paying, Expedia will close out the transaction with the GDS, therefore
622300	625920	sending the Passenger Name Record to the airline, which will respond with a modified version
625920	629560	including a confirmation number, which is then extracted and sent to the customer in
629560	632440	a flashy, well-formatted email.
632440	637240	The GDS, and its associated systems, were revolutionary for the airline industry.
637240	641980	Not only did they make reservations a far less labor-intensive process, they made essentially
641980	645380	every airline reservation system interoperable with each other.
645380	649740	These days it's fairly simple for airlines to sell tickets involving other airlines—they're
649740	653700	all using the same GDS already, so the way United's internal systems interpret and
653700	657020	modify a PNR is the same way Lufthansa's would.
657020	661700	Theoretically, United could sell you an itinerary connecting onto an American Airlines flight—they
661700	665380	wouldn't because they don't have a commercial partnership with the airline, but from a technical
665380	669340	perspective there's nothing stopping them, and if something goes wrong and your United
669340	674100	flight cancels, the airline can and occasionally will rebook flights onto American, Delta,
674100	675780	and others using this system.
675780	681100	But while the GDS was revolutionary, it hardly still is today.
681100	685320	In fact, at airports around the world, when you step up to a reservations agent, chances
685320	688620	are the other side of their screen looks like this.
688620	694080	Still today, in 2023, the GDS has operated as a command-line interface, the way computers
694080	698340	worked before graphical user interfaces were popularized in the 80s.
698340	702620	American interfaces aren't in and of themselves an issue, but in context, the difficulty is
702620	706460	that using them requires legitimate creativity and skill.
706460	711220	Let's say, for example, a customer is here in Denver, headed to Zurich, and their 1.40
711220	715340	pm flight to Chicago to connect onto the 7.10 overnight to Zurich just cancelled, meaning
715340	717260	they won't make their connection.
717260	721220	A rebooking agent would start by querying the GDS for the next available itinerary between
721220	725420	the two cities, and they would see there's a viable one connecting onto a 7.20 pm Swiss
725420	729380	Air flight out of LAX, but the problem is that the only two flights to LA that would
729380	735420	make that, at 1.36 and 3.55, are already oversold, meaning there's no seat available for the
735420	736660	stranded passenger.
736660	741900	So, according to the GDS, it's impossible to get that passenger on their way to Zurich
741900	743940	until the next day.
743940	748640	But just because the GDS says it's impossible doesn't mean it actually is.
748640	752500	For example, an experienced rebooking agent would know that United also flies to John
752500	756780	Wayne Airport in Orange County, about an hour's drive from LAX, so if desperate,
756780	760940	the passenger could fly to there, take a taxi to LAX, then make their overnight flight to
760940	761940	Switzerland.
761940	765940	The GDS can't offer this as an option because it's not one that the airline would sell,
765940	769780	so it's not in the system, but with this knowledge, an agent could individually book
769780	774380	seats for each leg, then string them together into an itinerary in the PNR.
774380	780200	The GDS also would know that United's 11.45 am LAX-bound flight was delayed until 1.30,
780200	783200	meaning this passenger could still take that and make the connection.
783200	787180	It also wouldn't suggest taking American's 4.10 pm flight to LAX as an option because
787180	791680	Swiss Air and American don't typically ticket together, but in this exceptional circumstance,
791680	795540	United could buy the stranded passenger a ticket on American through the GDS to continue
795540	797200	their journey on Swiss.
797200	801240	And this is only the tip of the iceberg—there are endless tricks to working with the GDS
801240	805920	to solve problems, but experience is needed to know the right technique.
805920	811240	The horrible truth this presents, for both passengers and airlines, is that, constantly,
811240	814760	passengers are getting stranded when they don't have to be—it's down to the luck
814760	815820	of the draw.
815820	818900	Is the rebooking agent you're walking up to one that's worked there for 30 years
818900	823120	and knows the GDS like the back of their hand, or have they just finished the limited required
823120	826120	training to complete those simplest tasks?
826120	830640	For passengers, this increases the frequency of getting stranded on the road, and for airlines,
830640	834440	this increases the cost borne from issuing meal vouchers, booking accommodation, and
834440	839240	paying for delay compensation when passengers don't get to their destination on time.
839240	844400	And the limitations of the GDS not only create additional costs, but also prevent potential
844400	845400	revenue.
845400	848920	For example, Air New Zealand developed an innovative product where three successive
848920	854020	economy-class seats can be transformed into a short, lie-flat bed called skycouch.
854020	859100	That means that those seats can be sold individually, as usual, or as a set of three to one or two
859100	860520	passengers.
860600	864960	This sort of optionality breaks the GDS—it doesn't have a way of properly communicating
864960	869880	or reserving these sorts of transformable seats, so on the GDS, skycouch seats are just
869880	873820	displayed as occupied, regardless of whether they actually are.
873820	877240	In order to book them, one has to go directly to the Air New Zealand website.
877240	881080	For the airline, this leaves plenty of potential revenue on the table.
881080	885080	For example, a huge portion of the airline's traffic is ticketed through United, since
885080	889800	United is a major partner that feeds inbound traffic from across the US to Air New Zealand's
889800	893640	long-haul flights out of LA, San Francisco, Houston, and Chicago.
893640	897840	Those passengers can book and check in exclusively with United, meaning they would never have
897840	902000	even had the chance to pay Air New Zealand for a skycouch, and it's the same with passengers
902000	905860	who booked through other airlines or online travel agencies.
905860	909560	Airlines have been complaining about the GDS system for decades, and so there are an increasing
909560	914200	number of technical solutions and workarounds to the GDS's constraints, but even those
914200	915200	have their problems.
915200	919780	For example, Iota introduced the New Distribution Capability Standard, which allows for more
919780	924700	complex back-end communication, but rather than serving as the solution to the GDS's
924700	929180	shortcomings, it more so demonstrates what's truly at the root of the problem.
929180	934940	162 airlines, travel agencies, system providers, and others are certified by Iota as having
934940	940220	properly integrated this new standard into their systems—or at least, part of it.
940220	945540	The core functions have pretty good uptake—for example, 156 of those have incorporated the
945540	950020	NDC standard that allows for shopping for flights—but then you get to the more novel
950020	951020	functions.
951020	955720	SHPAN2 is a standard that allows for the sale of increasingly common unbundled anciliaries
955720	960780	like inflight Wi-Fi, lounge access, priority boarding, and more, meaning that, theoretically,
960780	964320	it allows someone booking through Expedia to buy that inflight Wi-Fi right in their
964320	965560	checkout flow.
965560	970220	But only 51 of the 162 are certified on this capability.
970220	974860	And then you get into the really specialized stuff—NDC has enabled airlines to have interoperable
974860	979220	dynamic pricing systems, meaning, rather than working with the constraints of the GDS
979220	983460	and ATP Co., which only allow for price updates a certain number of times per day, each fare
983460	987740	would be customized for each individual consumer based on an algorithm's estimation of their
987740	989180	price sensitivity.
989180	994340	But to date, not a single airline is certified on this already-existing, revenue-generating
994340	995840	standard.
995840	998380	This is a familiar refrain.
998380	1001820	Airlines ask for more advanced systems, more advanced systems are developed, then airlines
1001820	1005060	don't use the more advanced systems because they decide the cost it would take to integrate
1005060	1006860	them isn't worth it.
1006860	1011500	And some airlines are going further, not only failing to implement new interoperable systems,
1011500	1013260	but rejecting their use altogether.
1013260	1017700	For example, if you search on Expedia for an itinerary between Denver and Long Beach,
1017700	1021780	it'll tell you the best option is a one-stop trip through Phoenix on American, but there
1021780	1025540	are actually three non-stop flights a day on that route.
1025540	1030100	The problem, though, is that they're Southwest flights, and with limited exception, Southwest
1030100	1034740	does not allow for booking through the GDS, meaning Expedia has no way to book a customer
1034740	1036220	a ticket on the airline.
1036220	1040200	Meanwhile, on Google Flights, which focuses on directing people where to book rather than
1040200	1044700	booking itself, you can find Southwest schedules, which are filed with OAG, but you can't
1044700	1049540	find fares—with no GDS sales, there's no reason to distribute fare information.
1049540	1053940	This all means that nearly all Southwest bookings are done on Southwest's website, but the
1053940	1058220	airline can customize and revenue-optimize the booking process as they wish.
1058220	1062940	The upsells are everywhere, before confirming a fare when it gets a pop-up outlining the
1062940	1065700	benefits of the next most expensive fare class.
1065700	1069540	On the following screens, there's the same upsell again, an offer for a $200 credit in
1069540	1073500	return for signing up for their credit card, and an option to pay for early check-in, guaranteeing
1073500	1075920	one of the best boarding positions.
1075920	1077880	These upsells matter.
1077880	1082780	In 2021, ancillary fees made up more than $4 billion in revenue for Southwest, and that
1082780	1087800	ancillary revenue is raised when customers book directly and are offered all the upsells.
1087800	1092140	And in addition to increased revenue, direct booking costs less—no paying for developers
1092140	1096040	to integrate their systems with others, no paying GDS fees, no paying commissions to
1096040	1097820	Expedia and others.
1097820	1102700	Following Southwest's lead, GDS non-participation by budget airlines is downright common these
1102700	1107080	days, and the full-service network carriers are increasingly working around it to strike
1107080	1111640	up direct business and system relationships with major sales channels and partners.
1111640	1115040	But this is fragmenting the industry.
1115040	1119100	Comments are innovating, which is exactly what the industry should be doing, but through
1119100	1123720	this individual innovation, are losing the collective interoperability that has led to
1123720	1127880	the globally seamless travel experience that customers have come to expect.
1127880	1132120	It's almost analogous to a reverse tragedy of the commons.
1132120	1136800	Each individual node in the system would grow their revenue by investing in better interoperable
1136800	1139680	systems, but only if every other node did too.
1139680	1143560	If only one node invests, they'll have spent money to create interoperability, but still
1143560	1148600	lack partners to interoperate with, meaning no revenue impact and a negative cost impact.
1148600	1153520	So, in this context, each node is actually incentivized to reduce interoperability to
1153520	1158020	push consumers towards their own systems, which are better designed to increase per-customer
1158020	1160200	revenue than the interoperable ones.
1160200	1163380	It's a strategic stalemate.
1163380	1168120	And this can explain the broader issue as well—there's a strategic IT stalemate.
1168120	1172560	When every airline's IT is equally bad, there's little competitive incentive to
1172560	1173720	improve it.
1173720	1178240	Why invest to improve to a level that the public doesn't even know is possible?
1178240	1184000	Globally, the airline industry has just settled on a culture of good enough.
1184000	1188680	The problem, from our outside perspective, is that airlines essentially act as public
1188680	1190200	utilities these days.
1190200	1194620	They're the only practical means of long-haul travel, and are also the only practical means
1194620	1200220	for medium-haul travel in areas of North America, Russia, Australia, and other larger, less-dense
1200220	1201220	countries.
1201260	1205860	Airlines slow down, people slow down, and therefore, economies slow down.
1205860	1209820	The US recognizes this fact by subsidizing the construction and maintenance of airports,
1209820	1214220	and even more strongly by subsidizing airlines to fly to rural and remote communities, under
1214220	1218820	the thesis that a lack of air travel options would hold back their economies.
1218820	1222560	And countries also recognize this preemptively, historically treating the earliest airlines
1222560	1226660	as government services and running them as state-owned enterprises, but in the century
1226660	1231460	sense, the trend has been thoroughly towards privatization, meaning the only real obligation
1231460	1232900	is to the shareholder.
1232900	1237460	So this is one of those all-too-common scenarios where there is a stark difference between
1237460	1240820	what's good for the shareholder, and what's good for the world.
1240820	1246060	Therefore, it's pretty simple—regulators need to decide whether airlines' IT antiquity
1246060	1251820	is a problem for the public, and if so, do something about it.
1251820	1256380	As many of you know, I travel constantly—I'm on the road more than I'm at home, and one
1256420	1260220	thing that I've found is crucial to making that level of travel sustainable is having
1260220	1264460	self-improvement routines that I can do both at home and on the road.
1264460	1268060	That means going to the gym, on runs, and a less common one that I've really grown
1268060	1271020	to love is using our sponsor, Brilliant.org.
1271020	1274980	That's because Brilliant has these really interesting, well-designed courses on STEM
1274980	1278340	subjects that probably seem way too hard to learn independently.
1278340	1282320	Crucially, these courses are designed so you can move through them in bite-sized chunks,
1282320	1285800	so while I'm at home, I might make some progress learning gravitational physics while
1285800	1288940	waiting for a call to start, while on the road, you might find me doing the same while
1288940	1290120	waiting for the plane to board.
1290120	1294080	And what's amazing about it is that, if you just do that enough times, suddenly you
1294080	1299720	understand how foundational and advanced math, or AI, data science, or neural networks work.
1299720	1303240	Obviously, these subjects are complex, but Brilliant makes learning them straightforward
1303240	1306800	by breaking them down into their intuitive principles, and by making it so you can learn
1306800	1310300	anywhere and anytime thanks to their mobile app.
1310300	1314200	And they have over 60 of these courses—few enough that you know they're really working
1314200	1318440	on making each one amazing, while many enough that they feature all the major STEM subjects
1318440	1319440	that you'd want to learn.
1319440	1323360	I think it's so cool that you can learn such big, complex subjects independently at
1323360	1327700	your own pace, so if you agree, you can try everything Brilliant has to offer, free, for
1327700	1332320	a full 30 days by visiting Brilliant.org slash Wendover, or clicking the button on screen.
