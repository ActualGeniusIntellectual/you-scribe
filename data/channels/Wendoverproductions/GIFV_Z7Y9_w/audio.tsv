0	5980	In 2020, one singularity dominated the news.
5980	11940	There was one story that filled almost every front page of every paper on every day.
11940	18180	If I asked you what was the biggest story from 2019, or 2018, or 17, or almost any other
18180	20880	year was, there'd be some debate.
20880	21880	But not in 2020.
21880	24780	I don't even have to tell you what I'm talking about.
24780	26540	You already know.
26540	31300	But just because the front pages were clogged up, that's not to say page two, three, or
31300	32300	four were.
32300	37420	While we may have stood still, the world kept spinning, and news kept happening.
37420	42980	Some of it was heavy, some was sad, some was bizarre, and some momentous, but what binds
42980	47160	these stories together is that you likely didn't hear about them.
47160	51060	By no fault of your own, it was difficult to follow what was happening in the world,
51060	55600	because the only thing you could hear was that one singular story.
55600	59040	The year's not over yet, though, at least as I'm saying this, and so there's still
59040	64560	a chance to catch up on the news you missed in 2020 from every country in the world.
64560	66460	Here's how this'll work.
66460	71200	We order the countries by population from largest to smallest according to 2019's
71200	72400	statistics.
72400	78760	There are 195 of them—193 countries recognized by the United Nations, plus two UN observer
78760	81060	states—Palestine and the Vatican City.
81060	85500	This list was chosen because it is the most definitive list—it's the list most commonly
85500	90060	used as a list of all countries—so some of its entries might include nations that
90060	95100	you or your government do not consider as countries, or omit ones that you or your government
95100	96100	do recognize.
96100	101780	At the end of the day, we had to pick a list, and if any is the list of countries, it's
101780	102780	this one.
102780	107300	Oh, and one more rule—the C-word, as in, the word that describes that one singular
107300	112360	story of 2020—you're not going to hear it once.
112360	117560	We start in China—the most populated country in the world, which continues to expand its
117560	121080	global presence, and in this case, its space presence too.
121080	126060	It became the second country in the world to plant a national flag on the moon, 50 years
126060	128240	after the United States did.
128240	132880	China is trying to catch up with American and Russian planetary endeavors and, in recent
132880	137920	years, has poured millions into its military-run space program with the hopes of sending humans
137920	139160	to the moon.
139160	143520	Another country with a burgeoning space program is India, where Amazon recently completed
143520	146040	its largest office building in the world.
146040	151160	The 1.8 million square foot behemoth was erected in Hyderabad, a city of 10 million that's
151160	154320	grown into a sizable technology and financial hub.
154320	158960	India, as the world's second most-populized country, is the fastest growing internet market
158960	163520	and Amazon joins other major tech multinationals which have open offices there, though none
163520	166560	with a campus that spans 65 football fields.
166560	171800	A United States man that was facing sentencing for two vehicle theft charges might be looking
171800	175640	at a lot more time now that he was caught faking his death.
175640	179560	His attorney submitted a fraudulent death certificate, and it might have passed had
179560	184240	there not been typos, like the misspelling of registry—stay in school, kids.
184240	189340	In Indonesia, a stimulus bill aimed at restarting Southeast Asia's largest economy was met
189340	194160	with months of protests because citizens said it slashed workers' rights and environmental
194160	195160	regulations.
195160	200200	But, President Joko Widodo signed the bill into law anyway, saying it will bring over
200200	204600	1 million jobs to the struggling economy, which until this year had been on an upward
204600	205600	trajectory.
205600	209560	Opponents, though, argue it weakens rules that already don't do enough to protect
209560	212760	the country's natural resources and workers.
212760	217040	Rice is a serious business in Southern Asia, and it's a profitable one too.
217040	222120	That's why Pakistan is vehemently fighting India over the long grain—Basmati, to be
222120	223200	specific.
223240	227500	This year, India applied to the European Union for a designation that recognizes basmati
227500	232440	rice as an exclusive export of the country, even though one-third of EU imports on the
232440	234360	product come from Pakistan.
234360	239720	In recent years, Pakistan's basmati rice exports to the EU have doubled while India's
239720	244360	are shrinking, which makes the designation, if granted, potentially more devastating and
244360	248540	further increases tensions between these two neighbors.
248540	253180	Between rainforest fires and a negligent president, the news streaming out of Brazil has been
253180	254180	heavy.
254180	260680	But, a new discovery about the mating habits of the theropotophora frog lightened the feed.
260680	265440	Frogs are either typically monogamous or not, meaning they get around.
265440	270380	This species, however, prefers harem-style—one male to two or more specific females—which
270380	274940	is much more common in mammals throughout the animal kingdom, but not seen before in
274940	276300	amphibians.
276300	281020	Dubbed group fidelity, finding this behavior in another set of four-legged animals checks
281020	284340	another box in the evolutionary list.
284340	289020	One particular virus has dominated the news cycle this year, but in Nigeria, they're
289020	293100	dealing with an entirely different one, too—the yellow fever.
293100	297740	The disease, which is spread by mosquitoes, had basically been eradicated for 20 years
297740	302780	until 2017, when it crept back into the country because of climate change and lower vaccination
302780	303780	rates.
303780	305500	Now, it's spiking.
305500	310300	In the latter half of 2020, 75 people have already died, and health officials worry that
310300	315460	number will increase as people are still hesitant to get vaccinated.
315460	320140	India is being beat in another metric as well, and it's an important one.
320140	324700	Bangladesh most likely surpassed India in gross domestic product this year according
324700	327220	to International Monetary Fund estimates.
327220	328300	Why does that matter?
328300	333640	Well, India is the world's sixth-largest economy, and its 10% GDP contraction is a
333640	336740	concerning indicator for the world economy.
336740	341200	Thanks to increased agricultural production and a focus on developing its low-wage labor
341200	348140	workforce, Bangladesh, on the other hand, was able to expand its GDP by 4% this year.
348140	352980	Another country that's known to be slightly competitive is Russia, and that's a problem
352980	358660	since they were banned from the biggest global sporting competition of 2020 because of doping.
358660	361780	That would be the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.
361820	366860	Of course, the event was postponed until 2021 anyway, but new investigations reveal that
366860	371180	Russia was planning to cyber-attack the games, which is something they've done before when
371180	375520	they attempted to wreak havoc on the Winter Olympics in South Korea by dismantling ticketing
375520	380440	and wifi for the opening ceremony, as well as targeting individual broadcasters, sponsors,
380440	381940	and athletes.
381940	385740	Before flights were ground to a halt in the spring, one health insurer in Utah was taking
385740	390540	advantage of Mexico's inexpensive pharmaceutical prices and actually flying public employees
390540	395100	from the United States to south of the border so they could buy drugs at a fraction of American
395100	396100	prices.
396100	400020	They also got the benefit of those in-flight snack peanuts and a free soda.
400020	404220	It's already saved the company a quarter of a million dollars, and now other states
404220	408460	are eyeing the move, and may mimic it once flight schedules resume to normal levels,
408460	413460	meaning Mexico is bound to see an even greater boost to its already burgeoning pharmaceutical
413460	415460	tourism industry.
415460	420220	Fugaku is not just fun to say, it's also the name of the world's speediest computer,
420220	423000	which was built this year in Japan.
423000	428460	The room-sized computer took first place in a speed-ranking competition between supercomputers,
428460	433080	carrying out 2.8 times more calculations than the second-place IBM machine built in the
433080	434440	United States.
434440	438460	This is notable for the Japanese, who have remained less competitive in the supercomputer
438460	442240	realm, often following the leads of the US and China.
442240	446460	The systems are used for complex military and scientific tasks, including breaking code
446460	451120	and modeling climate change, and, of course, winning competitions.
451120	454980	Africa is getting its own Great Wall—a green one.
454980	460980	The ambitious reforestation project is supposed to stretch 4,350 miles or 7,000 kilometers
460980	464860	from Djibouti to Senegal, with an aimed completion date of 2030.
464860	470700	Ethiopia is on track to meet its goal, having already planted 5.5 billion seedlings.
470700	475940	But, its neighbors are slow to start, and the project is only 4% complete at the halfway
475940	479100	mark, mostly due to financial struggles.
479100	483460	It turns out, it takes a lot of green to make a green wall, and so it's proving difficult
483460	488460	for some of the world's poorest countries to take this project to completion.
488460	492820	Money problems are also the reason that the Philippines' largest news network cited,
492820	497440	when it shuttered dozens of its regional stations around the country, but the audience isn't
497440	498900	buying this excuse.
498900	504340	Instead, they're wondering if it has more to do with President Rodrigo Duterte's criticism
504340	507700	of the network's coverage of his anti-drug platform.
507700	512720	Either way, the loss will be felt by millions of rural residents who rely on the network
512720	516420	as a lifeline for critical information.
516420	522260	Wealthy residents of Egypt are getting their 15 minutes of fame just 2,500 years too late.
522260	527300	More than 100 ornately painted wooden coffins were unearthed by archaeologists near Saqqara,
527300	530620	20 miles or 30 kilometers south of Cairo.
530620	535380	This area is a large burial ground and is home to more than a dozen sites with similar
535380	536380	tombs.
536380	540380	This discovery, however, is one of the most exciting in recent years and comes at a time
540380	544600	when the country continues to try to draw tourists back after a sharp decline resulting
544600	548020	from the Arab Spring in the early 2010s.
548020	552220	Tourism isn't a problem in Vietnam, where 18 million people visit per year, and that
552220	557780	should mean liquor sales aren't either, but a new zero-tolerance drunk-driving law
557780	562620	that went into effect this year has taken the fizz out of one of the world's faster-growing
562620	564140	beer markets.
564140	569700	Since implementation, beer sales have dropped 25% in the country, and violators face a fine
569700	576040	of up to $345, which is double what the average Vietnamese makes in a month.
576040	581300	Even those who think riding a bike is a safe alternative will be shocked with a $25 fine
581300	583300	for drunk pedaling.
583300	588860	In other 2020 epidemic news, the World Health Organization declared that an Ebola outbreak
588860	594660	in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was officially over after two years and 2,280
594660	595660	deaths.
595660	601040	It was the country's tenth outbreak of the disease, but it's second most deadly, stemming
601040	605140	from people's mistrust of the government and feuding between officials.
605140	608220	That doesn't mean the country is in the clear, though, as it's now dealing with
608220	613540	the world's largest measles epidemic and, of course, the global pandemic.
613540	619740	Germans are taking a stand in, well, technically a sit in Dannenruder Forest, south of Frankfurt,
619740	623180	where they've been camped out to oppose the government's construction of a highway
623180	629300	that will route through the wildlands and cut down 67 acres, or 27 hectares, of 250-year-old
629300	630300	trees.
630300	634200	These activists are calling the government hypocritical for cutting down cherished trees
634200	639100	when it should focus on public transportation infrastructure, and both sides expect standoffs
639100	641080	for months to come.
641080	646000	Also bad news for trees are the more than 9 million that have died in Turkey.
646000	650480	Last year, as part of National Forestation Day, volunteers across the country planted
650480	658320	11 million trees across more than 2,000 sites, including 303,150 saplings planted in Kouroum,
658320	662280	which broke the world record for most trees planted in a single location.
662280	667200	Now officials are reporting that up to 90% of these have died because they either weren't
667200	670540	planted properly or lacked enough rainfall to grow.
670540	675120	In neighboring Iran, a woman was filmed riding a bike without a hijab near a major mosque
675120	676460	in Nayefabad.
676460	677460	Why is this news?
677460	683400	Well, in Iran, it's been against Islamic law since 1979 for women to be seen in public
683400	688040	without a covering for their head and hair, and this is largely obeyed.
688040	692140	Although women have started to push the limits in larger cities, like Tehran, it's still
692140	695480	widely criticized and, in this case, punishable.
695480	700960	The woman was arrested for this display, which was widely shared on social media.
700960	706680	Another arrestable offense, this time in Thailand, is riding a bad online review—yes, you heard
706680	707740	that correctly.
707740	711560	An American living in the Southeast Asian country wasn't happy with being charged
711560	716140	a $15 dollar corkage fee at a beach resort in Koh Chang, so he did what any thumb-happy
716140	719720	traveler would do and wrote a negative TripAdvisor review.
719720	724280	The hotel was equally displeased and had him arrested on defamation charges, which are
724280	728620	notably harsh in a country that attempts to stifle some free speech.
728620	731500	He therefore spent a weekend in jail.
731500	736280	In more turbulent waters, construction started on what will soon be the world's largest
736280	737800	offshore wind farm.
737800	741780	When completed, the Dogger Wind Farm, in the North Sea off the eastern coast of the United
741780	748380	Kingdom, will provide enough energy to power 4.5 million homes every year, or 5% of England's
748380	749920	total energy demand.
749920	754260	The enormous energy production capability is made possible by their use of one of the
754260	761060	world's largest wind turbines, the Halyard X, which stands 853 feet or 260 meters tall
761060	765220	and has 351 foot or 107 meter blades.
765220	769540	Requiring much less power than that, though, is the Amis—a mini-car released in France
769540	773660	that can be driven without a license by anyone over 14.
773660	777540	Manufactured by Citroën, the all-electric Amis is what's officially dubbed a light
777540	778760	quadricycle.
778760	783420	The four-wheel cube can travel 28 miles per hour or 45 kilometers per hour with a range
783420	788900	of 46 miles or 75 kilometers, and it's got a mini price too, ringing in at just over
788900	791260	$7,000.
791260	795540	Another European product is making headlines, but this time, it's for the lack of it.
795540	799540	The world's second-largest producer of olive oil, Italy, has been plagued by bad
799540	804660	weather and a deadly bacteria, cutting production by more than a quarter this year.
804660	809360	The Xylella bacteria, also called leprosy, has hit the olive trees in the Puglia region
809360	813220	particularly hard, and those effects will be felt globally, especially in the United
813220	817280	States, which purchases one-third of Italy's oil.
817280	822980	At the southern end of the world, a 116-year-old man died in South Africa.
822980	827600	He was, however, the oldest man in the world at the time of his passing, at least unofficially,
827600	832140	having lived through the Spanish flu, which took the lives of his entire family.
832140	837020	He credited his long life to quote, God's grace, but it may have been health and strength
837020	841820	too—a couple weeks before he died of natural causes, his family said he was chopping wood
841820	844300	with a four-pound hammer.
844300	849100	Up the African coast, the two largest tanzanite gemstones ever unearthed were pulled out of
849100	852340	the only country in which they're found—Tanzania.
852340	857180	The two dark violet-blue minerals, each about 11 inches or 30 centimeters long and 4 inches
857180	863560	or 10 centimeters thick, rang in roughly $3.35 million for the mining boss who runs the 200-person
863560	866120	operation in the country's northern region.
866120	870500	He did what anybody who struck the motherlode would do—promise to build a school and shopping
870500	874140	mall, but first through a neighborhood party.
874140	878220	Multiple drug raids in the hills of Myanmar revealed a complex and burgeoning synthetic
878220	882580	drug market, that's speculated to be fueling global demand for opioids like methamphetamine
882580	883660	and fentanyl.
883660	888340	The seizures were the largest finds in Southeast Asian history, and represent a transition
888340	892900	away from China, which had previously been supplying many of the chemicals for synthetics,
892900	896020	but cracked down under worldwide pressure.
896020	900580	In Kenya, the score is one for the fig tree, zero for developers.
900580	904900	A four-story tree in the country's capital of Nairobi was set to be cut down to make
904900	909660	way for an expressway, but environmentalists put up a fight, and they won.
909660	914140	Not only will the tree be preserved in its spot, but it's now been elevated to legend
914140	919540	status, gaining notoriety both as an environmental symbol and as a call to action to protect
919540	925180	even more green space in a city that's constantly seeing parks and nature eliminated.
925180	930940	In grimmer news, the mayor of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, was found dead in a park this
930940	931940	summer.
931940	936240	A potential presidential candidate and the second most powerful person in the country,
936240	939260	so the passing sent unrest through the nation.
939260	944300	Several days before his death, a former secretary accused him of sexual harassment—especially
944300	948260	shocking since he was a champion of women's rights in a male-dominated country—so his
948260	951140	death is being treated as a suicide.
951140	955300	A less grim story comes from another mayor on the other side of the world in Bogota,
955300	960100	Colombia, who recently became the first openly lesbian mayor ever for the capital city in
960100	961300	January.
961300	966600	This was a historic moment for the conservative Catholic country, and Latin America in general.
966600	971240	Claudia López married her partner in 2019, and is recognized for being a progressive
971240	975740	beacon in a region that's slow to progress LGBTQ rights.
975740	980500	Yachting in the Iberian Sea was a little more raucous than usual this fall, after a string
980500	984700	of orca incidents were reported in Spain, in which killer whales were targeting boat
984700	988300	rudders and causing damage to more than a dozen vessels.
988300	992480	The increasingly aggressive interactions initially puzzled researchers, but they now
992480	997540	believe the trio of orcas, which accounted for almost two-thirds of the two dozen reports,
997540	1001920	were previously injured by a boat and perhaps reacting defensively to yachts because of
1001920	1004500	those traumatic incidents.
1004500	1008880	Another boating story brings us to Argentina, where a determined sailor finally docked on
1008880	1013580	land after completing an 85-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean.
1013580	1017820	The Portuguese resident set sail in mid-March after lockdown restrictions kept him from
1017860	1020280	travelling to sea his 90-year-old father.
1020280	1025020	He would not be deterred by the lack of flights, and decided to voyage by sea in his 29-foot
1025020	1029140	boat accompanied by rice, canned tuna, and fruit.
1029140	1034140	Uganda is home to 50% of the world's mountain gorillas, so when one of the country's most
1034140	1039300	famous, Rafiki, was killed by a poacher, the government took a harder stance than it had
1039300	1040300	previously.
1040300	1044020	Officials chose to jail the killer for six years.
1044020	1049180	This landmark ruling sends a message to future poachers that animal killings won't be tolerated,
1049180	1052920	and is a win for wildlife groups which have been calling for more restrictive measures
1052920	1055060	for many years.
1055060	1061380	In terms of on-brand news for 2020, wildfires coming within one mile of Chernobyl in Ukraine
1061380	1063540	has to be near the top of the list.
1063540	1068380	An 18-mile exclusion zone was set up after the nuclear disaster there in the 80s, and
1068380	1073060	this wildfire spread into that area, causing officials to worry that not only would radioactive
1073100	1077940	material be dispersed into the air, but that it might threaten existing structures and
1077940	1079480	a disposal site.
1079480	1084420	More than 300 firefighters were able to control the burn, preventing this lesser-known story
1084420	1087220	from becoming a major headline.
1087220	1091620	When a migrant rescue boat came across a backpack floating in the Mediterranean Sea, officials
1091620	1096120	had assumed its owners had perished in crossing from Algeria to Italy, as is often the case
1096120	1099660	with many found personal objects floating in this part of the world.
1099660	1102140	But this time, there was a happy ending.
1102140	1106620	An NGO in Italy was able to track down the owners of the personal items, who were migrants
1106620	1111540	that survived a shipwreck, and return the contents to them, which included their inscribed
1111540	1113140	wedding rings.
1113140	1117980	Sudan is taking baby steps towards democracy after three decades of oppressive laws that
1117980	1120160	were primarily targeted towards women.
1120160	1124700	Of highest priority is banning female genital mutilation—a typically religious practice
1124700	1127880	that affects almost 90% of Sudanese women.
1127880	1132280	The new transitional government is also loosening wardrobe restrictions for women and saying
1132280	1137020	okay to alcohol consumption, at least for non-Muslims, in the country.
1137020	1141480	The 3,600-year-old Gilgamesh Dream Tablet is being returned to its rightful home in
1141480	1145920	what is now Iraq, where it originated, after a curious and illegal journey that brought
1145920	1150260	it to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, which was co-founded by none other than
1150260	1153520	tablet king and craft retail giant Hobby Lobby.
1153520	1158120	The rare cuneiform tablet features one of the oldest works of literature in the world,
1158120	1163240	the Epic of Gilgamesh, and was purchased by Hobby Lobby at auction for $1.6 million in
1163240	1164560	2014.
1164560	1169100	This isn't the first time Hobby Lobby has had problems with the provenance of its acquisitions,
1169100	1175880	as it previously had to forfeit 5,500 artifacts and pay a $3 million fine.
1175880	1180960	National identity cards in Afghanistan include a person's name, date of birth, and now,
1180960	1186460	both of their parents' names, which sounds pretty normal, but previously, just the father's
1186460	1190840	name was listed because using a women's in public was traditionally frowned upon and
1190840	1195960	even considered an insult—it's a restriction that goes so far that much of Afghanistan
1195960	1199000	does not list females' names on their gravestones.
1199000	1203740	This step in updating ID cards is seen as a small victory for women's rights in the
1203740	1206720	overwhelmingly conservative country.
1206720	1211920	When a herd of elephants at Poland's Warsaw Zoo became sad after losing their matriarch,
1211920	1217560	which lead a given herd, veterinarians turned to Colorado's favorite stress reliever—medical
1217560	1218960	marijuana.
1218960	1223480	The three African elephants are given doses of liquid cannabis through their trunks, and
1223480	1227940	researchers will study hormone levels in their blood over the next two years to monitor how
1227940	1229960	it affects their stress.
1229960	1235440	A small town of 7,000 people in Canada gave itself a new identity when they voted this
1235440	1240740	year to change the city's name from Asbestos to Val-de-Sauce, or Valley of the Springs.
1240740	1245520	The town got its name for being home to the largest asbestos mine in the world, but since
1245520	1249960	the mineral has been linked to causing cancer and the mine has shut, residents voted to
1249960	1252520	disassociate from the toxic substance.
1252520	1255300	But it wasn't without a fight.
1255300	1259000	More veteran members of the community were opposed to the name change as they felt it
1259000	1263800	was unnecessary, because in French, which is spoken there, the word for asbestos is
1263800	1265160	ambiente.
1265160	1270480	Tensions are simmering in a United Nations-backed buffer zone between Morocco and Mauritania,
1270480	1274440	which could bring a 29-year truce to a boiling point.
1274440	1279120	The Western Sahara contested zone has long been controlled by Morocco under a ceasefire
1279120	1283320	agreement with the Polisario Front—a pro-independence movement.
1283320	1288120	But now, the front has blocked transportation between the two countries, and Morocco has
1288120	1291520	launched a military operation in response.
1291520	1296120	On the same latitude, but a few time zones over, Saudi Arabia wants to maintain its claim
1296120	1300600	as the world's top energy exporter, but now with hydrogen.
1300600	1305640	Blue hydrogen is a carbon dioxide byproduct of reforming natural gas, and Saudi Arabia
1305640	1310660	sent its first cargo shipment of it to Japan this year, all in an effort to profit off
1310660	1313440	the world's transition to greener fuels.
1313440	1318320	Part of this goal also includes plans to build a $5 billion hydrogen-based ammonia plant
1318320	1321600	powered by renewable energy on the Red Sea.
1321600	1327040	Uzbekistan's language can be written in three ways—Arabic, Cyrillic, and Latin—but
1327040	1331640	it's the latter that will soon be the norm, thanks to a decree by the country's president
1331640	1335120	which called for a faster transition away from Cyrillic.
1335120	1339920	Though Uzbek was originally written in Arabic, Russian influence during the early 20th century
1339920	1345160	changed it to Cyrillic, and now, to distance itself from Russia, Uzbekistan wants to move
1345160	1350980	towards Latin script, consisting of 29 letters and one apostrophe, to help develop a stronger,
1350980	1353840	more unique national identity.
1353840	1357740	Peruvians are hoping that the third time's a charm after three presidents reigned in
1357740	1359280	just one week.
1359280	1364600	Francisco's Sagasti will now lead the country, following a Congress-led ousting of one president,
1364600	1368000	and a five-day term-turned-resignation by the second.
1368000	1372960	Sagasti is seen as a consensus builder, so citizens are hopeful, but the tumultuous leadership
1372960	1378280	changes over the past several years leave a lot of uncertainty and, frankly, apathy
1378280	1380320	at this point.
1380320	1385880	If there's a baby boom this spring, a shortage of condom manufacturing in March may be the
1385880	1386880	culprit.
1386880	1392360	A Malaysian company, Carex BHD, makes one in every five condoms globally, and when the
1392360	1397900	pandemic hit this year, facilities were forced to shut down, resulting in at least 100 million
1397900	1400000	fewer condoms worldwide.
1400040	1404720	It ramped back up quickly, but the effects of a shortage like this could be at least
1404720	1406360	nine months away.
1406360	1411240	It's been… a year for Africa's richest woman, Isabel Dos Santos.
1411240	1415520	She's the eldest daughter of Angola's former longtime leader, José Eduardo Dos
1415520	1420920	Santos, and in January was charged with embezzlement and laundering more than $1 billion from her
1420920	1422080	native country.
1422080	1428360	Then, in October, her husband died in, reportedly, a diving accident off the coast of Dubai.
1428360	1432760	She was an avid art collector and also tied up in the scandal she faced, meaning it's
1432760	1439000	a tragic tale with lots of plot twists that doesn't seem to have a final chapter yet.
1439000	1444600	Another story about $1 billion revolves around the United Kingdom's investment in Mozambique.
1444600	1449760	This year, a deal was inked to send UK taxpayer-funded financial support to develop and export the
1449760	1454000	African country's gas reserves—one of the largest financing projects on the continent
1454000	1457960	ever, according to some reports—but its citizens and environmental groups are shouting
1457960	1462700	hypocrite as the UK continues to claim it's a global leader in the fight against climate
1462700	1463840	change.
1463840	1469080	Speaking of oil in Africa, a floating storage and offloading facility moored off the coast
1469080	1474400	of Yemen continues to deteriorate and threatens to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil
1474400	1479720	into the Red Sea, which would be four times the amount of the Exxon Valdez spill.
1479720	1484520	The war in Yemen has prevented the United Nations from doing anything to prevent a potential
1484520	1489360	leak, but recently Houthi rebels, which control the area where the vessel is stuck and the
1489360	1494320	oil company that owns it, gave permission for world leaders to move ahead with rehabilitation
1494320	1496040	plans.
1496040	1501040	The African country of Ghana may be a respite for Black Americans seeking refuge from the
1501040	1505720	United States' ongoing racial injustice, and Ghanaian officials are actually recruiting
1505720	1507960	members of the African diaspora.
1507960	1512880	The government set up a handful of enticements for transplants, including land yields, expatriate
1512880	1518160	guides, and quicker paths to citizenship, and all of this comes on the heels of a 45%
1518160	1522160	increase in visitor numbers from the United States last year.
1522160	1527520	Math, science, and reading are, of course, required subjects for children in school,
1527520	1531520	and now, in one country, downward dog is too.
1531520	1537520	In March, Nepal became the first nation in the world to incorporate yoga into its mandatory
1537520	1538960	curriculum.
1538960	1543080	Parents in the Himalayan country won't just practice the poses, but they'll learn about
1543080	1546840	the history of yogic thought and Ayurvedic medicine.
1546840	1552400	Children, or the idea of them at least, are making headlines in Venezuela, where controversial
1552400	1557140	Twitter-happy president Nicolas Maduro asks for every woman in the country to have six
1557140	1558300	children.
1558300	1563760	The plea was met with immediate backlash because the country is in a deep economic recession,
1563760	1567720	and is unable to provide essential services like food and healthcare for the millions
1567720	1569980	of residents it already has.
1569980	1574560	He apparently views more children as part of the solution, though he offered little
1574560	1577760	in the way of specifics as to how.
1577760	1579680	Ever heard of Voltsko's chameleon?
1579680	1580680	No?
1580680	1584680	Well, that's okay, almost nobody has since the elusive reptile hadn't been seen in
1584680	1588720	almost 100 years and was actually placed on the extinction list.
1588720	1593840	But, this year, a team of researchers spotted it on the northwest tip of Madagascar.
1593840	1598760	There, the reptile is only thought to live during the rainy season, making it a mayfly
1598760	1599760	of vertebrae.
1599760	1604240	This, of course, makes it even more vulnerable to the deforestation that continues to threaten
1604240	1609400	their sheer existence, but its rediscovery gives scientists hope for other species which
1609400	1611720	were also thought to be extinct.
1611720	1617580	The unearthing of four 8,000-year-old skeletons in Cameroon is a groundbreaking find that's
1617580	1621100	providing new information about our current human species.
1621100	1626260	The DNA from these skeletons offers the first genetic material from West African humans,
1626260	1631420	painting a better picture of how ancient people split into four genetic groups, both physically
1631420	1633060	and geographically.
1633060	1637180	Of the four populations, it's been the West African genes that have remained elusive to
1637180	1640060	researchers until now.
1640060	1645420	Political unrest looms over the Ivory Coast as President Alassane Otaara won, controversially,
1645420	1647900	a third term in November.
1647900	1652380	When his planned successor suddenly died this summer, Otaara reneged on his pledge
1652380	1658660	to leave office, and even though he received 94% of the vote, many, including the opposition,
1658660	1660260	saw the process as unfair.
1660260	1664980	It's indicative of a wider trend in African politics, which has seen third-term bids and
1664980	1669100	constitutional amendments increasing in recent years.
1669100	1674320	More than 40% of North Korean men smoke, but a new law that bans puffing down in public
1674320	1677420	places might smolder that statistic.
1677420	1682820	Citing health reasons, tobacco is now prohibited in specific venues such as political and ideological
1682820	1687420	education centers, theaters, cinemas, and medical and public health facilities.
1687420	1689820	One person who might struggle with this new law?
1689820	1694100	Leader Kim Jong-un, who is a chain-smoker and frequently photographed with a cigarette
1694100	1695100	in hand.
1695100	1699500	But, the country is moving forward with the prohibition despite being unable to convince
1699500	1702660	its supreme leader to kick the habit.
1702660	1706860	Another big find was recently made by scientists—this time in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast
1707300	1712700	of Australia—where a pinnacle of coral one-third of a mile long was discovered by researchers.
1712700	1716300	While you might think that the world-famous natural wonder would be thoroughly mapped
1716300	1721060	out, this was actually the first major new element of the reef to be discovered in over
1721060	1723180	120 years.
1723180	1727540	Of course, the reef is shrinking by the year due to the effects of climate change and coral
1727540	1733180	bleaching, so even the discovery of this comparatively small section is great news.
1733180	1738220	Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, but its location also makes it a key regional
1738220	1741940	recipient of Western aid funding the fight against Islamic terrorism.
1741940	1747660	That's why an audit of its defense spending that revealed a loss of $137 million over
1747660	1750420	8 years raised more than eyebrows.
1750420	1755260	Apparently, the country was overcharged in several instances, sometimes by nearly $20
1755260	1759900	million, for important military equipment, and Western countries that grant Niger money
1759900	1763300	are questioning their decisions and potentially future giving.
1763300	1767740	You don't have to worry about the spread of airborne viruses in Sri Lanka's newest
1767740	1770740	museum because it's underwater.
1770740	1774380	Created by naval officers off the southern tip of the island nation, the country's
1774380	1779140	first ever below-water museum is a collection of artifacts and sculptures installed 50 feet
1779140	1780660	beneath the surface.
1780660	1785540	The attraction is not only intended to draw tourists, but it should lure fish and spur
1785540	1787580	coral growth too.
1787580	1792620	One of Burkina Faso's largest gold mines was shut down for almost a year after 39 employees
1792620	1795200	were killed in an attack on their convoy.
1795200	1799040	Since then, the Canadian-owned Bungu mine has restarted with tightened security measures
1799040	1801060	and improved infrastructure.
1801060	1804960	During the year hiatus, the mine's owners actually changed from one Canadian company
1804960	1810680	to another for $735 million, which is notable because, even though agriculture still accounts
1810680	1815340	for 80% of the country's economy, gold exports driven by foreign investments continue to
1815340	1818220	develop alternate economic sectors.
1818220	1822940	And on the subject of West African unrest, a military coup in Mali ousted the country's
1822940	1827500	president and prime minister in August, following eight years of disrupted elections, government
1827500	1830420	corruptions, and Islamic insurgency.
1830420	1833100	Military colonels remain in power today.
1833100	1837300	This further instability could send ripple effects across the region because of Mali's
1837300	1841420	strategic location for Western countries such as France and the United States, which have
1841420	1845420	actively tried to prevent increased tensions in the area.
1845420	1850700	File this story under Stranger Than Fiction because, well, it's about non-fiction.
1850700	1855960	Some 200 books, including first editions by Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton, were found buried
1855960	1860860	underneath a rural Romanian cottage, after a three-year search that spanned 45 addresses
1860860	1862500	in three countries.
1862500	1867740	The $3.35 million worth of books were stolen during a heist from a London warehouse in
1867740	1869660	2017.
1869660	1871100	Wanting to get away from it all?
1871100	1877420	For a cool $20 million, you can buy a 50,000-acre island off the coast of Chile.
1877420	1882540	Acquiring private islands is nothing new, but this one is making headlines because environmentalists
1882540	1886980	and the indigenous population are not happy that this biodiversity hotspot has a price
1886980	1888600	tag at all.
1888600	1892280	Even though the island has been in private hands for a century, they're worried that
1892280	1897180	new ownership could jeopardize its future conservation and sets a dangerous precedent.
1897700	1902820	In an effort to bolster its economy, Malawi became the fifth African country to decriminalize
1902820	1904620	medical marijuana.
1904620	1908740	Almost 80% of the country's population is employed in agriculture, and it used to be
1908740	1913760	a major producer of tobacco, but, as global demand for tobacco declines, it's looking
1913760	1915780	for alternate revenue streams.
1915780	1920460	Enter Malawi gold, an already popular strain of recreational cannabis.
1920460	1925140	The country's dry climate is actually conducive to growing marijuana, and as the herb's
1925140	1930740	popularity increases around the world, Malawians plan to jump on the ganja train.
1930740	1935700	Kazakhstan is known for a few things—its oil and gas economy, its proximity to Russia
1935700	1940220	and Mongolia, and just generally for being a stan—but in Western culture, it's perhaps
1940220	1944900	most famous for one of its fictional natives, Borat Sagdiev.
1944900	1949640	Played by actor Sacha Baron Cohen, the satirical character Borat pokes fun at Kazakhstan with
1949640	1954140	the catchphrase, very nice, but officials there realize those words have standing power,
1954140	1958440	and recently officially adopted them as their official tourism slogan.
1958440	1963780	The African Ansel mole rat, native to Zambia, is near-blind, burrows underground, and this
1963780	1968420	year, scientists discovered it can sense magnetic fields with its eyes.
1968420	1972900	Though the animal's eyes are barely functional, discerning between just light and dark, this
1972900	1977340	new discovery gives more clues as to how the creature travels and lives in an underground
1977340	1982860	network up to 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers long, and of course, it may help humans in
1982860	1988180	our own scientific advances, as we learn more about nature, and as we often do, try
1988180	1989780	to mimic it.
1989780	1994540	Government officials in Guatemala passed a $12.2 billion budget that raised stipends
1994540	1998460	for representatives' meals, while cutting funding for human rights agencies, health
1998460	2002860	care, and education, triggering residents to protest in the streets and set the congressional
2002860	2004700	building on fire.
2004700	2008980	Their anger at the misplaced spending comes on the heels of not only the pandemic, but
2008980	2012780	two destructive hurricanes that tore through the country this fall.
2012780	2017360	It turns out, tragedy after tragedy is when people need help the most.
2017360	2021980	In July, Ecuador reported that more than 300 Chinese fishing vessels were encroaching on
2021980	2026260	its exclusive fishing zones near the Galapagos, with the illegal fishing fleets going as far
2026260	2029540	as to turn off their tracking devices to remain undetected.
2029540	2034500	So, the South American country joined coastal neighbors Chile, Peru, and Colombia to file
2034500	2039400	a joint statement—or rather, a light threat—about protecting their waters from the increasing
2039400	2044120	creep of foreign fishing and, ultimately, China's expanding presence.
2044120	2048320	Overseas, some new research into the life of the Netherlands' most famous artist,
2048320	2052640	Vincent van Gogh, reveals that he didn't suffer from schizophrenia or syphilis, as
2052640	2056960	some have theorized, but rather that the delirium leading up to his death may be attributed
2056960	2058740	to alcohol withdrawal.
2058740	2063840	The artist was institutionalized twice—once after cutting off his ear—and reported hallucinations
2063840	2065660	both times.
2065660	2069280	Researchers now believe these symptoms were due to his lack of wine and absinthe, which
2069280	2074860	he consumed in great amounts during the most prolific, and final, years of his life.
2074860	2081180	In somber news, Syria topped an unenviable list in 2019, being named the deadliest place
2081180	2083700	in the world for humanitarian workers.
2083700	2088240	The report on the subject, released this year, details that the number of people killed helping
2088240	2092940	the war-torn country rose sharply last year, with the majority of deaths stemming from
2092940	2094500	aerial strikes.
2094500	2099020	Officials say the grim statistic will make it harder to recruit aid workers to a place
2099020	2101460	where they're needed the most.
2101460	2106140	One rodent that's turning its species' reputation around is Magawa, a landmine-sniffing
2106140	2108060	rat in Cambodia.
2108060	2113100	The five-year-old African pouched rat has discovered 39 landmines, 28 pieces of unexploded
2113100	2118540	ordnance, and helped clear more than 1.5 million square feet of land over the past four years,
2118540	2122980	rightfully earning itself the gold medal from the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals.
2122980	2128060	That, unsurprisingly, makes it the first rat to receive an award that is usually reserved
2128060	2129780	for humans.
2129780	2135380	After the tragic port explosion in Beirut, Senegal moved quickly to avoid a similar catastrophe
2135380	2140000	and removed 3,050 tons of ammonium nitrate from its port.
2140000	2145260	The substance was transported to Mali, where it was used to make bombs for mining operations.
2145260	2149960	Ammonium nitrate is commonly found in fertilizers and explosives, so ports around the world
2149960	2154600	which temporarily house the volatile compound, such as Senegal's Dakar, made sure they
2154600	2158560	weren't in the same vulnerable situation as Beirut, where the substance led to the
2158560	2162200	accidental explosion that killed 190 people.
2162200	2166960	South African extrative economies continue to make headlines, such as Chad, which recently
2166960	2173360	asked UNESCO to postpone the process for designating Lake Chad as a World Heritage Site.
2173360	2174360	Why?
2174360	2178760	Because Chad wants to explore oil and gas development in the lake area, which directly
2178760	2182920	opposes UNESCO's conservation goals for World Heritage Sites.
2182920	2188320	It also came as a surprise to Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, which cooperated on the two-year
2188320	2193800	application process for the multinational lake to gain this distinctive designation.
2193800	2199000	More fish theft brings us to the coast of Somalia, which stretches 2,000 miles or 3,200
2199000	2202480	kilometers and is the longest coastline in Africa.
2202480	2206520	That expanse makes it harder for the country to police its waters, where poachers like
2206520	2211760	a 192-vessel fleet from Iran are illegally fishing in the country's exclusive economic
2211760	2212860	zone.
2212860	2217960	The size of the Iranian operation, discovered this year, is a blow to Somalia, where one
2217960	2222980	in three residents face hunger, and it demonstrates the rising tensions over the planet's limited
2222980	2225360	natural resources.
2225360	2229880	One resource being exported out of Africa that benefits from increased demand is a Zimbabwean
2229880	2233900	film that became the country's first feature to make it to Netflix.
2233900	2238340	The movie, Cook-Off, is about a woman who enters a TV cooking show, and it was made
2238340	2244360	for just $8,000—an impressive feat given that it was produced in 2017, just before
2244360	2246660	the country's economy collapsed.
2246660	2251220	This acquisition by the streaming giant gives more credibility to Zimbabwe's film industry,
2251220	2256040	and means that the production crew and actors may finally get paid.
2256040	2260300	A small band of chimpanzees in Guinea that are known for their remarkable use of tools
2260300	2264940	were thought to be near extinction, until the tribe's last fertile female gave birth
2264940	2268220	to a beacon of hope—another female.
2268220	2273420	Deforestation and isolation led to the tribe's demise, and this group is of particular interest
2273420	2277100	to researchers because they mimic humans' use of tools.
2277100	2280980	But this bundle of joy has also created momentum for the country's residents to increase
2280980	2286540	protections and forestation to ensure there is a future for the chimpanzees.
2286780	2290500	One of the world's most wanted fugitives was found this year in a small apartment on
2290500	2292180	the outskirts of Paris.
2292180	2297660	Felicia Cabuga was arrested for his role in the Rwandan genocide, which killed 800,000
2297660	2302340	members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, among others, in 1994.
2302340	2307320	Cabuga will be tried in a UN tribunal court next year, and this capture renews efforts
2307320	2313300	to find others on the run who played significant roles in the country's darkest days.
2313300	2318100	France and Benin also made news in 2020, with the former's government fast-tracking a
2318100	2322760	bill aimed at returning looted objects to the sub-Saharan country within a year.
2322760	2326620	The move is part of a multi-year restitution effort between European countries and their
2326620	2331160	former colonies, and this law specifically returns 26 royal artifacts that were stolen
2331160	2334340	from the Abomi Palace during the 19th century.
2334340	2338980	These cultural repatriation efforts are ongoing, signaling an African drive to reclaim its
2338980	2343580	cultural identity after centuries of European pillaging.
2343580	2347800	Efforts to protect sea turtles in Tunisia are working, says new scientific research
2347800	2354180	that shows nests on Kiryat Island have increased from 11 to more than 40 since 1997.
2354180	2358260	Turtles are a keystone species, meaning their disappearance would disproportionately damage
2358260	2363480	ecosystems, and their increased presence in this area, despite threats from people, climate,
2363480	2368920	and pollution, is good news for the reptiles and the workers striving to save them.
2368920	2373800	Two Chinese bidders, with the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman, bought a Belgian racing
2373800	2378400	pigeon for a record price of $1.9 million.
2378400	2384180	Belgium is the world's leading racing pigeon-breeding country and, thanks to a booming economy,
2384180	2390160	the Chinese upper class have a lot of money to spend even compared to a decade ago, so
2390160	2392660	why not invest in something like a pigeon?
2392660	2397120	The bird will likely be bred with another genetically superior pigeon to create a superbird
2397120	2401520	that will dominate in racing circles, and betting on those is just one area where the
2401520	2405040	Chinese are spending significant amounts of their yuan.
2405040	2410520	11 months in Argentina sounds nice, but for Bolivian president Evo Morales, it was more
2410520	2411680	of an exile.
2411680	2416200	He reentered Bolivia this November, after a 2019 campaign for a fourth presidential
2416200	2420600	term became marred by fraud allegations, leading him to flee the country.
2420600	2425280	A caretaker government has managed affairs since then, but when Morales' former economic
2425280	2429560	minister recently assumed leadership, it paved the way for Morales to return, though
2429560	2433240	it's unclear what role he'll play in the country's new reality.
2433240	2435520	If it all sounds turbulent, it is.
2435520	2439640	Latin American countries continue to struggle with government instability, and this is just
2439640	2442440	one more on the list.
2442440	2447200	The financial situation in Cuba worsened this year, when the United States placed increased
2447200	2452520	restrictions on the country, forcing the closure of 400 Western Union offices, and potentially
2452520	2455560	cutting off a stream of remittances from abroad.
2455560	2459280	The United States claims the move came in response to the Cuban government purportedly
2459280	2464120	siphoning a cut of the incoming money, but officials there say the move was politically
2464120	2465120	motivated.
2465120	2469680	Cuban-American relations have become more tenuous under Trump, but the new Biden administration
2469680	2474760	is expected to reinstate diplomatic relations, especially since Cuban refugee Alejandro Mayorkas
2474760	2478160	has been nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security.
2478160	2482520	Popping one island over, Haiti's local president of FIFA, the governing body for
2482520	2486160	soccer, has been shut out and not in the winning way.
2486160	2490520	Haitian football president Yves Jean-Barre was issued a lifetime ban from all football-related
2490520	2495720	activities after he was found guilty of sexually harassing and abusing female players, including
2495720	2496720	minors.
2496720	2500540	He was also fined roughly $1.1 million.
2500540	2505080	Many are lauding the punishment, saying abuse should be rooted out of any industry at any
2505080	2506400	level.
2506680	2511000	South Sudan is the world's youngest country, formed in 2011.
2511000	2515780	Since then, it's experienced almost a decade of civil war, but earlier this year, feuding
2515780	2518940	parties finally signed a unity agreement.
2518940	2522920	Millions of people continue to flee the country and suffer from extreme hunger, but the establishment
2522920	2528440	of a ruling party offers one step in the right direction toward stability.
2528440	2534020	President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 55.
2534020	2538320	He leaves behind a legacy as an autocratic ruler known for committing a variety of human
2538320	2542980	rights abuses, and his death in June came just weeks after the country had already elected
2542980	2547960	a successor, which only happened because Nkurunziza did not seek re-election.
2547960	2552140	His death will have impacts on regional and global relations, potentially allowing for
2552140	2555660	increased unity under new leadership.
2555660	2560060	Despite the pandemic, the Dominican Republic has hosted more than two dozen feature film
2560060	2564980	and TV production shoots this year, which poured $80 million into the local economy,
2564980	2570100	smashing a previous annual record of $30 million in 2017.
2570100	2573840	Producers track their local expenditures because part of the country's international incentive
2573840	2578180	for filming there is a 25% rebate through a transferable tax credit.
2578180	2582340	That's attractive to American filmmakers, like M. Night Shyamalan, who took advantage
2582340	2587040	of it this year, because they can spend 25% of wages in the Dominican Republic and maintain
2587040	2590480	tax incentive status in the United States.
2590480	2594160	A deer stealing their rifle isn't something that hunters would think they'd have to
2594160	2598560	worry about when out stalking, but that's what happened to one in the Czech Republic
2598560	2603800	when his dog startled the deer, which ran toward him and looped his rifle with an antler.
2603800	2607200	The deer was seen a mile away, with the gun still in tow.
2607200	2611920	Reportedly, it wasn't loaded, but had it been, a deer claiming self-defense might have
2611920	2613920	worked in this case.
2613920	2618440	Still filed under bizarre sightings is a tiny child floating on an inflatable unicorn in
2618440	2620040	the Mediterranean Sea.
2620040	2624280	The three-year-old girl was swept into the water while playing on a beach in Greece,
2624280	2627220	but rescued shortly after by a passing ferryboat.
2627220	2632240	She was delivered back to her family safely, and yes, the unicorn made it too.
2632240	2637780	When Brazilian Maya Guevara surfed a 73.5 foot or 22.4 meter wave off the coast of Portugal
2637780	2642480	in February, she didn't just ride the biggest wave ever for a woman, it was the largest
2642480	2647580	wave surfed by anyone, period, during the 2019-2020 season.
2647580	2652000	She is the first woman in professional surfing to top all men in terms of wave size in a
2652000	2656920	season, but with another female surfer earning spot number two on the big wave list this
2656920	2660440	year, it's clear she may not hold the title for long.
2660440	2664600	The title for the highest smoking rate in the world goes to Jordan, where a shocking
2664600	2670020	80% of the male population says they use smoke or use nicotine products daily.
2670020	2675060	This was a status previously held by Indonesia, and bucked the global trend of declining tobacco
2675060	2676060	use.
2676060	2679820	Multinational tobacco companies are still allowed to hold a large amount of influence
2679820	2683780	in Jordan, from funding school programs to being featured on the Prime Minister's social
2683780	2689140	media, and this widespread interference is likely what's increasing use.
2689140	2694660	Rapper Cardi B may have overstepped her political boundaries when she posted an advertisement
2694660	2699080	supporting Armenia to her 76 million Instagram followers.
2699140	2703960	Unlike all wars, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been a tragic one that ended
2703960	2708180	with Armenia's defeat in a pact between the two countries over the disputed territory
2708180	2711920	of Nagorno-Karabakhsh, which will remain with Azerbaijan.
2711920	2716200	But Cardi B was only trying to help a real estate agent friend when she made the post,
2716200	2719520	and has since apologized amid the backlash.
2719520	2724180	Unstaffed grocery stores accessed by logging in with BankID, the national identification
2724180	2728460	app operated by Sweden's banks, seems like something only Sweden could pull off in remote
2728460	2732260	areas, which is why they're probably the ones doing it.
2732260	2737000	Amid a drastic decline in food markets across the country, mostly in rural areas, the company
2737000	2742660	Livs has installed almost 20 small container stores that are fully stocked with meat, vegetables,
2742660	2744340	dairy, and desserts.
2744340	2749660	Customers simply swipe an app to enter and pay for groceries, no store clerk needed.
2749660	2753020	Israeli flights traveling to and from the United Arab Emirates can now cross through
2753020	2757300	Saudi Arabian airspace, marking the first time that commercial jets on this route can
2757300	2759420	pass over the Kingdom's territory.
2759420	2762700	The announcement cuts travel time between the two countries in half, to three and a
2762700	2768460	half hours, and signals normalizing relations, both diplomatically and economically.
2768460	2773220	According to reports, the decision to open the airspace came at the request of the UAE.
2773220	2778860	It became the third Arab country to acknowledge relations with Israel, behind Egypt and Jordan,
2778860	2783020	and the development signals some progress in an otherwise unstable region, though Saudi
2783020	2787420	Arabia was quick to note that opening airspace didn't change the country's stance on
2787420	2790140	the Israel-Palestine issue.
2790140	2795380	Despite having previously faced murder charges, Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, aka the Tiger,
2795380	2798380	was still named police chief in 2012 in Honduras.
2798380	2802900	So, it may not come as a surprise that he didn't uphold the tenets of the job, and
2802900	2807820	is now charged with conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States, but the plot
2807820	2808820	thickens.
2808820	2812900	He wasn't smuggling cocaine for just anyone, but doing the dirty work for the Honduran
2812900	2816580	president and his brother, the latter of which was convicted for drug trafficking in
2816580	2818900	New York last year.
2818900	2825460	In Hungary, a scientist accidentally created a new fish hybrid in a lab dubbed the sturtlefish.
2825460	2830180	The combination of Russian sturgeon, whose eggs make premium caviar, and American paddlefish,
2830180	2834460	a filter feeder found in less than half of the United States, is an unlikely one that
2834460	2839340	would probably never have occurred without human intervention, based on geography alone.
2839340	2843740	And while there's no real practical purpose to the awkward-looking creature, it does demonstrate
2843740	2848460	that species' genetics are sometimes more similar than previously thought.
2848460	2854660	Also in the neighborhood is the proposed Baltic Black Sea Waterway—a 12,040-mile, 2,000-kilometer
2854660	2858780	inland shipping route that would cut through Poland, Ukraine, and some of the most ecologically
2858780	2860340	rich parts of Belarus.
2860340	2864500	Oh, and it would involve dredging up land inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, which
2864500	2868340	could potentially expose millions of people to latent nuclear waste.
2868340	2872140	Proponents say it would spur an economic boom for the region, while opponents argue
2872140	2875140	it will destroy the quote, Amazon of Europe.
2875140	2879140	It may end up happening piecemeal, with Ukraine and Belarus committing, and already starting
2879140	2883540	in some cases, to dredging up parts of their tributary rivers.
2883540	2887920	Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in East Asia, and many residents cross into
2887920	2891320	Russia for higher-paying jobs and higher education.
2891320	2896300	The Russian-speaking population in this country has dwindled tenfold in four decades, but
2896300	2900180	there's new interest in teaching children their neighbor's language, marked by officials'
2900180	2904100	announcement that they would build five more Russian-speaking schools, with a capacity
2904100	2908680	for 1,200 students in each, in addition to the ten that have been constructed in just
2908680	2910860	the past two years.
2910860	2916300	A musician in Austria is pulling a different sort of string—that of Wolfgang Amadeus
2916300	2919060	Mozart's 250-year-old violin.
2919060	2922940	The musician took a leap when he asked the foundation that owns the violin if he could
2922940	2927800	borrow it to play and record the violin concertos on the exact instrument Mozart composed them
2927800	2931140	on between 1773 and 1775.
2931140	2936700	The answer was yes, and he performed them in October to small, live audiences.
2936700	2941020	A group of United Nations officials signed a letter to four countries protesting the
2941020	2945300	development of a massive mine in Papua New Guinea, citing grave concerns both for the
2945300	2947700	environment and human rights.
2947700	2951780	If built, the mine would be the largest in the nation's history, and potentially produce
2951780	2956740	$1.5 billion of gold, copper, and silver annually for 30 years.
2956740	2960860	But that money would mostly go to Chinese investors in the Australian Registered Mining
2960860	2964820	Company, and the real costs would come in the form of catastrophic economic disaster
2964820	2968300	on the Sepik River, where it would be located.
2968300	2973440	More than 43 million tweets amplifying positive news coverage of Serbian President Aleksandr
2973440	2978500	Vucic were linked to his Serbian Progressive Party, and Twitter subsequently blocked 8,500
2978500	2981360	accounts for attempts to undermine public conversation.
2981360	2985740	The tweets were making his governing look better than it actually was, and this isn't
2985740	2987220	just happening in Serbia.
2987220	2991880	The tech company blocked some additional 13,000 accounts in countries like Egypt, Honduras,
2991880	2995960	and Saudi Arabia for doing the same thing.
2995960	3000840	Serbia is the 98th largest country in the world, meaning we're halfway to 195.
3000840	3006160	Therefore, that's where we'll end part one, and part two will be going up December
3006160	3007160	31st.
3007160	3011340	While you wait for that, though, I have something else, new and rather exciting, for you to
3011340	3012340	watch.
3012340	3017600	Tomorrow, on Nebula, we release the first episode of Sam from Wendover Presents, a very
3017600	3019700	good trivia show presented by Sam from Wendover.
3019700	3024460	You see, we were going to film something for our last Nebula Original of the year on location,
3024460	3027860	like we normally do, but then, you know, everything got in the way.
3027860	3030060	Can't break our C-word rule now.
3030060	3035440	Therefore, we decided to do something completely different—a trivia show, filmed remotely,
3035440	3040140	with three fantastic contestants—Brian from Real Engineering, Dave from City Beautiful,
3040140	3041140	and Jordan Harrod.
3041140	3045360	They competed in seven games, some of which were pretty normal, and others of which were
3045360	3047120	pretty out there.
3047120	3051480	This was all hosted by me, and I even go on camera, so get mentally prepared for that.
3051480	3055900	Of course, the only place to watch this is on Nebula, as their business model makes bigger
3055900	3059940	projects like this financially possible, and there's quite literally never been a better
3059940	3061140	time to sign up.
3061140	3066900	That's because our sponsor, CuriosityStream, is having its biggest ever sale—41% off,
3066900	3072000	meaning it works out to less than $1 a month, and by signing up at CuriosityStream.com
3072000	3076700	slash Wendover, any subscription is bundled with a Nebula subscription for the exact same
3076700	3077700	price.
3077700	3082320	That's two whole streaming sites, with thousands of top-quality documentaries and non-fiction
3082320	3087000	shows from bigger names, in the case of CuriosityStream, and tons of bigger-budget projects from your
3087000	3091060	favorite educational-ish creators, in the case of Nebula, for less than the cost of
3091060	3093060	a bus fare per month.
3093060	3096660	While you wait for our original to come out, you could, for example, watch something quite
3096660	3101920	similar to this video—it's where CuriosityStream rounds up the top science stories of 2020
3101920	3105280	in an hour-long special, which is quite good.
3105280	3109540	This sale will end very soon, so make sure to sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover,
3109540	3113580	and you'll be supporting this and countless other independent channels while you're
3113580	3113600	at it.
