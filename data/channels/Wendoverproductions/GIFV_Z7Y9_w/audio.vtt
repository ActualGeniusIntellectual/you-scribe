00:00.000 --> 00:05.980
In 2020, one singularity dominated the news.

00:05.980 --> 00:11.940
There was one story that filled almost every front page of every paper on every day.

00:11.940 --> 00:18.180
If I asked you what was the biggest story from 2019, or 2018, or 17, or almost any other

00:18.180 --> 00:20.880
year was, there'd be some debate.

00:20.880 --> 00:21.880
But not in 2020.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.780
I don't even have to tell you what I'm talking about.

00:24.780 --> 00:26.540
You already know.

00:26.540 --> 00:31.300
But just because the front pages were clogged up, that's not to say page two, three, or

00:31.300 --> 00:32.300
four were.

00:32.300 --> 00:37.420
While we may have stood still, the world kept spinning, and news kept happening.

00:37.420 --> 00:42.980
Some of it was heavy, some was sad, some was bizarre, and some momentous, but what binds

00:42.980 --> 00:47.160
these stories together is that you likely didn't hear about them.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.060
By no fault of your own, it was difficult to follow what was happening in the world,

00:51.060 --> 00:55.600
because the only thing you could hear was that one singular story.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.040
The year's not over yet, though, at least as I'm saying this, and so there's still

00:59.040 --> 01:04.560
a chance to catch up on the news you missed in 2020 from every country in the world.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.460
Here's how this'll work.

01:06.460 --> 01:11.200
We order the countries by population from largest to smallest according to 2019's

01:11.200 --> 01:12.400
statistics.

01:12.400 --> 01:18.760
There are 195 of them—193 countries recognized by the United Nations, plus two UN observer

01:18.760 --> 01:21.060
states—Palestine and the Vatican City.

01:21.060 --> 01:25.500
This list was chosen because it is the most definitive list—it's the list most commonly

01:25.500 --> 01:30.060
used as a list of all countries—so some of its entries might include nations that

01:30.060 --> 01:35.100
you or your government do not consider as countries, or omit ones that you or your government

01:35.100 --> 01:36.100
do recognize.

01:36.100 --> 01:41.780
At the end of the day, we had to pick a list, and if any is the list of countries, it's

01:41.780 --> 01:42.780
this one.

01:42.780 --> 01:47.300
Oh, and one more rule—the C-word, as in, the word that describes that one singular

01:47.300 --> 01:52.360
story of 2020—you're not going to hear it once.

01:52.360 --> 01:57.560
We start in China—the most populated country in the world, which continues to expand its

01:57.560 --> 02:01.080
global presence, and in this case, its space presence too.

02:01.080 --> 02:06.060
It became the second country in the world to plant a national flag on the moon, 50 years

02:06.060 --> 02:08.240
after the United States did.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.880
China is trying to catch up with American and Russian planetary endeavors and, in recent

02:12.880 --> 02:17.920
years, has poured millions into its military-run space program with the hopes of sending humans

02:17.920 --> 02:19.160
to the moon.

02:19.160 --> 02:23.520
Another country with a burgeoning space program is India, where Amazon recently completed

02:23.520 --> 02:26.040
its largest office building in the world.

02:26.040 --> 02:31.160
The 1.8 million square foot behemoth was erected in Hyderabad, a city of 10 million that's

02:31.160 --> 02:34.320
grown into a sizable technology and financial hub.

02:34.320 --> 02:38.960
India, as the world's second most-populized country, is the fastest growing internet market

02:38.960 --> 02:43.520
and Amazon joins other major tech multinationals which have open offices there, though none

02:43.520 --> 02:46.560
with a campus that spans 65 football fields.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.800
A United States man that was facing sentencing for two vehicle theft charges might be looking

02:51.800 --> 02:55.640
at a lot more time now that he was caught faking his death.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.560
His attorney submitted a fraudulent death certificate, and it might have passed had

02:59.560 --> 03:04.240
there not been typos, like the misspelling of registry—stay in school, kids.

03:04.240 --> 03:09.340
In Indonesia, a stimulus bill aimed at restarting Southeast Asia's largest economy was met

03:09.340 --> 03:14.160
with months of protests because citizens said it slashed workers' rights and environmental

03:14.160 --> 03:15.160
regulations.

03:15.160 --> 03:20.200
But, President Joko Widodo signed the bill into law anyway, saying it will bring over

03:20.200 --> 03:24.600
1 million jobs to the struggling economy, which until this year had been on an upward

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
trajectory.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.560
Opponents, though, argue it weakens rules that already don't do enough to protect

03:29.560 --> 03:32.760
the country's natural resources and workers.

03:32.760 --> 03:37.040
Rice is a serious business in Southern Asia, and it's a profitable one too.

03:37.040 --> 03:42.120
That's why Pakistan is vehemently fighting India over the long grain—Basmati, to be

03:42.120 --> 03:43.200
specific.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.500
This year, India applied to the European Union for a designation that recognizes basmati

03:47.500 --> 03:52.440
rice as an exclusive export of the country, even though one-third of EU imports on the

03:52.440 --> 03:54.360
product come from Pakistan.

03:54.360 --> 03:59.720
In recent years, Pakistan's basmati rice exports to the EU have doubled while India's

03:59.720 --> 04:04.360
are shrinking, which makes the designation, if granted, potentially more devastating and

04:04.360 --> 04:08.540
further increases tensions between these two neighbors.

04:08.540 --> 04:13.180
Between rainforest fires and a negligent president, the news streaming out of Brazil has been

04:13.180 --> 04:14.180
heavy.

04:14.180 --> 04:20.680
But, a new discovery about the mating habits of the theropotophora frog lightened the feed.

04:20.680 --> 04:25.440
Frogs are either typically monogamous or not, meaning they get around.

04:25.440 --> 04:30.380
This species, however, prefers harem-style—one male to two or more specific females—which

04:30.380 --> 04:34.940
is much more common in mammals throughout the animal kingdom, but not seen before in

04:34.940 --> 04:36.300
amphibians.

04:36.300 --> 04:41.020
Dubbed group fidelity, finding this behavior in another set of four-legged animals checks

04:41.020 --> 04:44.340
another box in the evolutionary list.

04:44.340 --> 04:49.020
One particular virus has dominated the news cycle this year, but in Nigeria, they're

04:49.020 --> 04:53.100
dealing with an entirely different one, too—the yellow fever.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.740
The disease, which is spread by mosquitoes, had basically been eradicated for 20 years

04:57.740 --> 05:02.780
until 2017, when it crept back into the country because of climate change and lower vaccination

05:02.780 --> 05:03.780
rates.

05:03.780 --> 05:05.500
Now, it's spiking.

05:05.500 --> 05:10.300
In the latter half of 2020, 75 people have already died, and health officials worry that

05:10.300 --> 05:15.460
number will increase as people are still hesitant to get vaccinated.

05:15.460 --> 05:20.140
India is being beat in another metric as well, and it's an important one.

05:20.140 --> 05:24.700
Bangladesh most likely surpassed India in gross domestic product this year according

05:24.700 --> 05:27.220
to International Monetary Fund estimates.

05:27.220 --> 05:28.300
Why does that matter?

05:28.300 --> 05:33.640
Well, India is the world's sixth-largest economy, and its 10% GDP contraction is a

05:33.640 --> 05:36.740
concerning indicator for the world economy.

05:36.740 --> 05:41.200
Thanks to increased agricultural production and a focus on developing its low-wage labor

05:41.200 --> 05:48.140
workforce, Bangladesh, on the other hand, was able to expand its GDP by 4% this year.

05:48.140 --> 05:52.980
Another country that's known to be slightly competitive is Russia, and that's a problem

05:52.980 --> 05:58.660
since they were banned from the biggest global sporting competition of 2020 because of doping.

05:58.660 --> 06:01.780
That would be the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

06:01.820 --> 06:06.860
Of course, the event was postponed until 2021 anyway, but new investigations reveal that

06:06.860 --> 06:11.180
Russia was planning to cyber-attack the games, which is something they've done before when

06:11.180 --> 06:15.520
they attempted to wreak havoc on the Winter Olympics in South Korea by dismantling ticketing

06:15.520 --> 06:20.440
and wifi for the opening ceremony, as well as targeting individual broadcasters, sponsors,

06:20.440 --> 06:21.940
and athletes.

06:21.940 --> 06:25.740
Before flights were ground to a halt in the spring, one health insurer in Utah was taking

06:25.740 --> 06:30.540
advantage of Mexico's inexpensive pharmaceutical prices and actually flying public employees

06:30.540 --> 06:35.100
from the United States to south of the border so they could buy drugs at a fraction of American

06:35.100 --> 06:36.100
prices.

06:36.100 --> 06:40.020
They also got the benefit of those in-flight snack peanuts and a free soda.

06:40.020 --> 06:44.220
It's already saved the company a quarter of a million dollars, and now other states

06:44.220 --> 06:48.460
are eyeing the move, and may mimic it once flight schedules resume to normal levels,

06:48.460 --> 06:53.460
meaning Mexico is bound to see an even greater boost to its already burgeoning pharmaceutical

06:53.460 --> 06:55.460
tourism industry.

06:55.460 --> 07:00.220
Fugaku is not just fun to say, it's also the name of the world's speediest computer,

07:00.220 --> 07:03.000
which was built this year in Japan.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.460
The room-sized computer took first place in a speed-ranking competition between supercomputers,

07:08.460 --> 07:13.080
carrying out 2.8 times more calculations than the second-place IBM machine built in the

07:13.080 --> 07:14.440
United States.

07:14.440 --> 07:18.460
This is notable for the Japanese, who have remained less competitive in the supercomputer

07:18.460 --> 07:22.240
realm, often following the leads of the US and China.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.460
The systems are used for complex military and scientific tasks, including breaking code

07:26.460 --> 07:31.120
and modeling climate change, and, of course, winning competitions.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.980
Africa is getting its own Great Wall—a green one.

07:34.980 --> 07:40.980
The ambitious reforestation project is supposed to stretch 4,350 miles or 7,000 kilometers

07:40.980 --> 07:44.860
from Djibouti to Senegal, with an aimed completion date of 2030.

07:44.860 --> 07:50.700
Ethiopia is on track to meet its goal, having already planted 5.5 billion seedlings.

07:50.700 --> 07:55.940
But, its neighbors are slow to start, and the project is only 4% complete at the halfway

07:55.940 --> 07:59.100
mark, mostly due to financial struggles.

07:59.100 --> 08:03.460
It turns out, it takes a lot of green to make a green wall, and so it's proving difficult

08:03.460 --> 08:08.460
for some of the world's poorest countries to take this project to completion.

08:08.460 --> 08:12.820
Money problems are also the reason that the Philippines' largest news network cited,

08:12.820 --> 08:17.440
when it shuttered dozens of its regional stations around the country, but the audience isn't

08:17.440 --> 08:18.900
buying this excuse.

08:18.900 --> 08:24.340
Instead, they're wondering if it has more to do with President Rodrigo Duterte's criticism

08:24.340 --> 08:27.700
of the network's coverage of his anti-drug platform.

08:27.700 --> 08:32.720
Either way, the loss will be felt by millions of rural residents who rely on the network

08:32.720 --> 08:36.420
as a lifeline for critical information.

08:36.420 --> 08:42.260
Wealthy residents of Egypt are getting their 15 minutes of fame just 2,500 years too late.

08:42.260 --> 08:47.300
More than 100 ornately painted wooden coffins were unearthed by archaeologists near Saqqara,

08:47.300 --> 08:50.620
20 miles or 30 kilometers south of Cairo.

08:50.620 --> 08:55.380
This area is a large burial ground and is home to more than a dozen sites with similar

08:55.380 --> 08:56.380
tombs.

08:56.380 --> 09:00.380
This discovery, however, is one of the most exciting in recent years and comes at a time

09:00.380 --> 09:04.600
when the country continues to try to draw tourists back after a sharp decline resulting

09:04.600 --> 09:08.020
from the Arab Spring in the early 2010s.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.220
Tourism isn't a problem in Vietnam, where 18 million people visit per year, and that

09:12.220 --> 09:17.780
should mean liquor sales aren't either, but a new zero-tolerance drunk-driving law

09:17.780 --> 09:22.620
that went into effect this year has taken the fizz out of one of the world's faster-growing

09:22.620 --> 09:24.140
beer markets.

09:24.140 --> 09:29.700
Since implementation, beer sales have dropped 25% in the country, and violators face a fine

09:29.700 --> 09:36.040
of up to $345, which is double what the average Vietnamese makes in a month.

09:36.040 --> 09:41.300
Even those who think riding a bike is a safe alternative will be shocked with a $25 fine

09:41.300 --> 09:43.300
for drunk pedaling.

09:43.300 --> 09:48.860
In other 2020 epidemic news, the World Health Organization declared that an Ebola outbreak

09:48.860 --> 09:54.660
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was officially over after two years and 2,280

09:54.660 --> 09:55.660
deaths.

09:55.660 --> 10:01.040
It was the country's tenth outbreak of the disease, but it's second most deadly, stemming

10:01.040 --> 10:05.140
from people's mistrust of the government and feuding between officials.

10:05.140 --> 10:08.220
That doesn't mean the country is in the clear, though, as it's now dealing with

10:08.220 --> 10:13.540
the world's largest measles epidemic and, of course, the global pandemic.

10:13.540 --> 10:19.740
Germans are taking a stand in, well, technically a sit in Dannenruder Forest, south of Frankfurt,

10:19.740 --> 10:23.180
where they've been camped out to oppose the government's construction of a highway

10:23.180 --> 10:29.300
that will route through the wildlands and cut down 67 acres, or 27 hectares, of 250-year-old

10:29.300 --> 10:30.300
trees.

10:30.300 --> 10:34.200
These activists are calling the government hypocritical for cutting down cherished trees

10:34.200 --> 10:39.100
when it should focus on public transportation infrastructure, and both sides expect standoffs

10:39.100 --> 10:41.080
for months to come.

10:41.080 --> 10:46.000
Also bad news for trees are the more than 9 million that have died in Turkey.

10:46.000 --> 10:50.480
Last year, as part of National Forestation Day, volunteers across the country planted

10:50.480 --> 10:58.320
11 million trees across more than 2,000 sites, including 303,150 saplings planted in Kouroum,

10:58.320 --> 11:02.280
which broke the world record for most trees planted in a single location.

11:02.280 --> 11:07.200
Now officials are reporting that up to 90% of these have died because they either weren't

11:07.200 --> 11:10.540
planted properly or lacked enough rainfall to grow.

11:10.540 --> 11:15.120
In neighboring Iran, a woman was filmed riding a bike without a hijab near a major mosque

11:15.120 --> 11:16.460
in Nayefabad.

11:16.460 --> 11:17.460
Why is this news?

11:17.460 --> 11:23.400
Well, in Iran, it's been against Islamic law since 1979 for women to be seen in public

11:23.400 --> 11:28.040
without a covering for their head and hair, and this is largely obeyed.

11:28.040 --> 11:32.140
Although women have started to push the limits in larger cities, like Tehran, it's still

11:32.140 --> 11:35.480
widely criticized and, in this case, punishable.

11:35.480 --> 11:40.960
The woman was arrested for this display, which was widely shared on social media.

11:40.960 --> 11:46.680
Another arrestable offense, this time in Thailand, is riding a bad online review—yes, you heard

11:46.680 --> 11:47.740
that correctly.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.560
An American living in the Southeast Asian country wasn't happy with being charged

11:51.560 --> 11:56.140
a $15 dollar corkage fee at a beach resort in Koh Chang, so he did what any thumb-happy

11:56.140 --> 11:59.720
traveler would do and wrote a negative TripAdvisor review.

11:59.720 --> 12:04.280
The hotel was equally displeased and had him arrested on defamation charges, which are

12:04.280 --> 12:08.620
notably harsh in a country that attempts to stifle some free speech.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.500
He therefore spent a weekend in jail.

12:11.500 --> 12:16.280
In more turbulent waters, construction started on what will soon be the world's largest

12:16.280 --> 12:17.800
offshore wind farm.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.780
When completed, the Dogger Wind Farm, in the North Sea off the eastern coast of the United

12:21.780 --> 12:28.380
Kingdom, will provide enough energy to power 4.5 million homes every year, or 5% of England's

12:28.380 --> 12:29.920
total energy demand.

12:29.920 --> 12:34.260
The enormous energy production capability is made possible by their use of one of the

12:34.260 --> 12:41.060
world's largest wind turbines, the Halyard X, which stands 853 feet or 260 meters tall

12:41.060 --> 12:45.220
and has 351 foot or 107 meter blades.

12:45.220 --> 12:49.540
Requiring much less power than that, though, is the Amis—a mini-car released in France

12:49.540 --> 12:53.660
that can be driven without a license by anyone over 14.

12:53.660 --> 12:57.540
Manufactured by Citroën, the all-electric Amis is what's officially dubbed a light

12:57.540 --> 12:58.760
quadricycle.

12:58.760 --> 13:03.420
The four-wheel cube can travel 28 miles per hour or 45 kilometers per hour with a range

13:03.420 --> 13:08.900
of 46 miles or 75 kilometers, and it's got a mini price too, ringing in at just over

13:08.900 --> 13:11.260
$7,000.

13:11.260 --> 13:15.540
Another European product is making headlines, but this time, it's for the lack of it.

13:15.540 --> 13:19.540
The world's second-largest producer of olive oil, Italy, has been plagued by bad

13:19.540 --> 13:24.660
weather and a deadly bacteria, cutting production by more than a quarter this year.

13:24.660 --> 13:29.360
The Xylella bacteria, also called leprosy, has hit the olive trees in the Puglia region

13:29.360 --> 13:33.220
particularly hard, and those effects will be felt globally, especially in the United

13:33.220 --> 13:37.280
States, which purchases one-third of Italy's oil.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.980
At the southern end of the world, a 116-year-old man died in South Africa.

13:42.980 --> 13:47.600
He was, however, the oldest man in the world at the time of his passing, at least unofficially,

13:47.600 --> 13:52.140
having lived through the Spanish flu, which took the lives of his entire family.

13:52.140 --> 13:57.020
He credited his long life to quote, God's grace, but it may have been health and strength

13:57.020 --> 14:01.820
too—a couple weeks before he died of natural causes, his family said he was chopping wood

14:01.820 --> 14:04.300
with a four-pound hammer.

14:04.300 --> 14:09.100
Up the African coast, the two largest tanzanite gemstones ever unearthed were pulled out of

14:09.100 --> 14:12.340
the only country in which they're found—Tanzania.

14:12.340 --> 14:17.180
The two dark violet-blue minerals, each about 11 inches or 30 centimeters long and 4 inches

14:17.180 --> 14:23.560
or 10 centimeters thick, rang in roughly $3.35 million for the mining boss who runs the 200-person

14:23.560 --> 14:26.120
operation in the country's northern region.

14:26.120 --> 14:30.500
He did what anybody who struck the motherlode would do—promise to build a school and shopping

14:30.500 --> 14:34.140
mall, but first through a neighborhood party.

14:34.140 --> 14:38.220
Multiple drug raids in the hills of Myanmar revealed a complex and burgeoning synthetic

14:38.220 --> 14:42.580
drug market, that's speculated to be fueling global demand for opioids like methamphetamine

14:42.580 --> 14:43.660
and fentanyl.

14:43.660 --> 14:48.340
The seizures were the largest finds in Southeast Asian history, and represent a transition

14:48.340 --> 14:52.900
away from China, which had previously been supplying many of the chemicals for synthetics,

14:52.900 --> 14:56.020
but cracked down under worldwide pressure.

14:56.020 --> 15:00.580
In Kenya, the score is one for the fig tree, zero for developers.

15:00.580 --> 15:04.900
A four-story tree in the country's capital of Nairobi was set to be cut down to make

15:04.900 --> 15:09.660
way for an expressway, but environmentalists put up a fight, and they won.

15:09.660 --> 15:14.140
Not only will the tree be preserved in its spot, but it's now been elevated to legend

15:14.140 --> 15:19.540
status, gaining notoriety both as an environmental symbol and as a call to action to protect

15:19.540 --> 15:25.180
even more green space in a city that's constantly seeing parks and nature eliminated.

15:25.180 --> 15:30.940
In grimmer news, the mayor of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, was found dead in a park this

15:30.940 --> 15:31.940
summer.

15:31.940 --> 15:36.240
A potential presidential candidate and the second most powerful person in the country,

15:36.240 --> 15:39.260
so the passing sent unrest through the nation.

15:39.260 --> 15:44.300
Several days before his death, a former secretary accused him of sexual harassment—especially

15:44.300 --> 15:48.260
shocking since he was a champion of women's rights in a male-dominated country—so his

15:48.260 --> 15:51.140
death is being treated as a suicide.

15:51.140 --> 15:55.300
A less grim story comes from another mayor on the other side of the world in Bogota,

15:55.300 --> 16:00.100
Colombia, who recently became the first openly lesbian mayor ever for the capital city in

16:00.100 --> 16:01.300
January.

16:01.300 --> 16:06.600
This was a historic moment for the conservative Catholic country, and Latin America in general.

16:06.600 --> 16:11.240
Claudia López married her partner in 2019, and is recognized for being a progressive

16:11.240 --> 16:15.740
beacon in a region that's slow to progress LGBTQ rights.

16:15.740 --> 16:20.500
Yachting in the Iberian Sea was a little more raucous than usual this fall, after a string

16:20.500 --> 16:24.700
of orca incidents were reported in Spain, in which killer whales were targeting boat

16:24.700 --> 16:28.300
rudders and causing damage to more than a dozen vessels.

16:28.300 --> 16:32.480
The increasingly aggressive interactions initially puzzled researchers, but they now

16:32.480 --> 16:37.540
believe the trio of orcas, which accounted for almost two-thirds of the two dozen reports,

16:37.540 --> 16:41.920
were previously injured by a boat and perhaps reacting defensively to yachts because of

16:41.920 --> 16:44.500
those traumatic incidents.

16:44.500 --> 16:48.880
Another boating story brings us to Argentina, where a determined sailor finally docked on

16:48.880 --> 16:53.580
land after completing an 85-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.820
The Portuguese resident set sail in mid-March after lockdown restrictions kept him from

16:57.860 --> 17:00.280
travelling to sea his 90-year-old father.

17:00.280 --> 17:05.020
He would not be deterred by the lack of flights, and decided to voyage by sea in his 29-foot

17:05.020 --> 17:09.140
boat accompanied by rice, canned tuna, and fruit.

17:09.140 --> 17:14.140
Uganda is home to 50% of the world's mountain gorillas, so when one of the country's most

17:14.140 --> 17:19.300
famous, Rafiki, was killed by a poacher, the government took a harder stance than it had

17:19.300 --> 17:20.300
previously.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.020
Officials chose to jail the killer for six years.

17:24.020 --> 17:29.180
This landmark ruling sends a message to future poachers that animal killings won't be tolerated,

17:29.180 --> 17:32.920
and is a win for wildlife groups which have been calling for more restrictive measures

17:32.920 --> 17:35.060
for many years.

17:35.060 --> 17:41.380
In terms of on-brand news for 2020, wildfires coming within one mile of Chernobyl in Ukraine

17:41.380 --> 17:43.540
has to be near the top of the list.

17:43.540 --> 17:48.380
An 18-mile exclusion zone was set up after the nuclear disaster there in the 80s, and

17:48.380 --> 17:53.060
this wildfire spread into that area, causing officials to worry that not only would radioactive

17:53.100 --> 17:57.940
material be dispersed into the air, but that it might threaten existing structures and

17:57.940 --> 17:59.480
a disposal site.

17:59.480 --> 18:04.420
More than 300 firefighters were able to control the burn, preventing this lesser-known story

18:04.420 --> 18:07.220
from becoming a major headline.

18:07.220 --> 18:11.620
When a migrant rescue boat came across a backpack floating in the Mediterranean Sea, officials

18:11.620 --> 18:16.120
had assumed its owners had perished in crossing from Algeria to Italy, as is often the case

18:16.120 --> 18:19.660
with many found personal objects floating in this part of the world.

18:19.660 --> 18:22.140
But this time, there was a happy ending.

18:22.140 --> 18:26.620
An NGO in Italy was able to track down the owners of the personal items, who were migrants

18:26.620 --> 18:31.540
that survived a shipwreck, and return the contents to them, which included their inscribed

18:31.540 --> 18:33.140
wedding rings.

18:33.140 --> 18:37.980
Sudan is taking baby steps towards democracy after three decades of oppressive laws that

18:37.980 --> 18:40.160
were primarily targeted towards women.

18:40.160 --> 18:44.700
Of highest priority is banning female genital mutilation—a typically religious practice

18:44.700 --> 18:47.880
that affects almost 90% of Sudanese women.

18:47.880 --> 18:52.280
The new transitional government is also loosening wardrobe restrictions for women and saying

18:52.280 --> 18:57.020
okay to alcohol consumption, at least for non-Muslims, in the country.

18:57.020 --> 19:01.480
The 3,600-year-old Gilgamesh Dream Tablet is being returned to its rightful home in

19:01.480 --> 19:05.920
what is now Iraq, where it originated, after a curious and illegal journey that brought

19:05.920 --> 19:10.260
it to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, which was co-founded by none other than

19:10.260 --> 19:13.520
tablet king and craft retail giant Hobby Lobby.

19:13.520 --> 19:18.120
The rare cuneiform tablet features one of the oldest works of literature in the world,

19:18.120 --> 19:23.240
the Epic of Gilgamesh, and was purchased by Hobby Lobby at auction for $1.6 million in

19:23.240 --> 19:24.560
2014.

19:24.560 --> 19:29.100
This isn't the first time Hobby Lobby has had problems with the provenance of its acquisitions,

19:29.100 --> 19:35.880
as it previously had to forfeit 5,500 artifacts and pay a $3 million fine.

19:35.880 --> 19:40.960
National identity cards in Afghanistan include a person's name, date of birth, and now,

19:40.960 --> 19:46.460
both of their parents' names, which sounds pretty normal, but previously, just the father's

19:46.460 --> 19:50.840
name was listed because using a women's in public was traditionally frowned upon and

19:50.840 --> 19:55.960
even considered an insult—it's a restriction that goes so far that much of Afghanistan

19:55.960 --> 19:59.000
does not list females' names on their gravestones.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.740
This step in updating ID cards is seen as a small victory for women's rights in the

20:03.740 --> 20:06.720
overwhelmingly conservative country.

20:06.720 --> 20:11.920
When a herd of elephants at Poland's Warsaw Zoo became sad after losing their matriarch,

20:11.920 --> 20:17.560
which lead a given herd, veterinarians turned to Colorado's favorite stress reliever—medical

20:17.560 --> 20:18.960
marijuana.

20:18.960 --> 20:23.480
The three African elephants are given doses of liquid cannabis through their trunks, and

20:23.480 --> 20:27.940
researchers will study hormone levels in their blood over the next two years to monitor how

20:27.940 --> 20:29.960
it affects their stress.

20:29.960 --> 20:35.440
A small town of 7,000 people in Canada gave itself a new identity when they voted this

20:35.440 --> 20:40.740
year to change the city's name from Asbestos to Val-de-Sauce, or Valley of the Springs.

20:40.740 --> 20:45.520
The town got its name for being home to the largest asbestos mine in the world, but since

20:45.520 --> 20:49.960
the mineral has been linked to causing cancer and the mine has shut, residents voted to

20:49.960 --> 20:52.520
disassociate from the toxic substance.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.300
But it wasn't without a fight.

20:55.300 --> 20:59.000
More veteran members of the community were opposed to the name change as they felt it

20:59.000 --> 21:03.800
was unnecessary, because in French, which is spoken there, the word for asbestos is

21:03.800 --> 21:05.160
ambiente.

21:05.160 --> 21:10.480
Tensions are simmering in a United Nations-backed buffer zone between Morocco and Mauritania,

21:10.480 --> 21:14.440
which could bring a 29-year truce to a boiling point.

21:14.440 --> 21:19.120
The Western Sahara contested zone has long been controlled by Morocco under a ceasefire

21:19.120 --> 21:23.320
agreement with the Polisario Front—a pro-independence movement.

21:23.320 --> 21:28.120
But now, the front has blocked transportation between the two countries, and Morocco has

21:28.120 --> 21:31.520
launched a military operation in response.

21:31.520 --> 21:36.120
On the same latitude, but a few time zones over, Saudi Arabia wants to maintain its claim

21:36.120 --> 21:40.600
as the world's top energy exporter, but now with hydrogen.

21:40.600 --> 21:45.640
Blue hydrogen is a carbon dioxide byproduct of reforming natural gas, and Saudi Arabia

21:45.640 --> 21:50.660
sent its first cargo shipment of it to Japan this year, all in an effort to profit off

21:50.660 --> 21:53.440
the world's transition to greener fuels.

21:53.440 --> 21:58.320
Part of this goal also includes plans to build a $5 billion hydrogen-based ammonia plant

21:58.320 --> 22:01.600
powered by renewable energy on the Red Sea.

22:01.600 --> 22:07.040
Uzbekistan's language can be written in three ways—Arabic, Cyrillic, and Latin—but

22:07.040 --> 22:11.640
it's the latter that will soon be the norm, thanks to a decree by the country's president

22:11.640 --> 22:15.120
which called for a faster transition away from Cyrillic.

22:15.120 --> 22:19.920
Though Uzbek was originally written in Arabic, Russian influence during the early 20th century

22:19.920 --> 22:25.160
changed it to Cyrillic, and now, to distance itself from Russia, Uzbekistan wants to move

22:25.160 --> 22:30.980
towards Latin script, consisting of 29 letters and one apostrophe, to help develop a stronger,

22:30.980 --> 22:33.840
more unique national identity.

22:33.840 --> 22:37.740
Peruvians are hoping that the third time's a charm after three presidents reigned in

22:37.740 --> 22:39.280
just one week.

22:39.280 --> 22:44.600
Francisco's Sagasti will now lead the country, following a Congress-led ousting of one president,

22:44.600 --> 22:48.000
and a five-day term-turned-resignation by the second.

22:48.000 --> 22:52.960
Sagasti is seen as a consensus builder, so citizens are hopeful, but the tumultuous leadership

22:52.960 --> 22:58.280
changes over the past several years leave a lot of uncertainty and, frankly, apathy

22:58.280 --> 23:00.320
at this point.

23:00.320 --> 23:05.880
If there's a baby boom this spring, a shortage of condom manufacturing in March may be the

23:05.880 --> 23:06.880
culprit.

23:06.880 --> 23:12.360
A Malaysian company, Carex BHD, makes one in every five condoms globally, and when the

23:12.360 --> 23:17.900
pandemic hit this year, facilities were forced to shut down, resulting in at least 100 million

23:17.900 --> 23:20.000
fewer condoms worldwide.

23:20.040 --> 23:24.720
It ramped back up quickly, but the effects of a shortage like this could be at least

23:24.720 --> 23:26.360
nine months away.

23:26.360 --> 23:31.240
It's been… a year for Africa's richest woman, Isabel Dos Santos.

23:31.240 --> 23:35.520
She's the eldest daughter of Angola's former longtime leader, José Eduardo Dos

23:35.520 --> 23:40.920
Santos, and in January was charged with embezzlement and laundering more than $1 billion from her

23:40.920 --> 23:42.080
native country.

23:42.080 --> 23:48.360
Then, in October, her husband died in, reportedly, a diving accident off the coast of Dubai.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.760
She was an avid art collector and also tied up in the scandal she faced, meaning it's

23:52.760 --> 23:59.000
a tragic tale with lots of plot twists that doesn't seem to have a final chapter yet.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.600
Another story about $1 billion revolves around the United Kingdom's investment in Mozambique.

24:04.600 --> 24:09.760
This year, a deal was inked to send UK taxpayer-funded financial support to develop and export the

24:09.760 --> 24:14.000
African country's gas reserves—one of the largest financing projects on the continent

24:14.000 --> 24:17.960
ever, according to some reports—but its citizens and environmental groups are shouting

24:17.960 --> 24:22.700
hypocrite as the UK continues to claim it's a global leader in the fight against climate

24:22.700 --> 24:23.840
change.

24:23.840 --> 24:29.080
Speaking of oil in Africa, a floating storage and offloading facility moored off the coast

24:29.080 --> 24:34.400
of Yemen continues to deteriorate and threatens to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil

24:34.400 --> 24:39.720
into the Red Sea, which would be four times the amount of the Exxon Valdez spill.

24:39.720 --> 24:44.520
The war in Yemen has prevented the United Nations from doing anything to prevent a potential

24:44.520 --> 24:49.360
leak, but recently Houthi rebels, which control the area where the vessel is stuck and the

24:49.360 --> 24:54.320
oil company that owns it, gave permission for world leaders to move ahead with rehabilitation

24:54.320 --> 24:56.040
plans.

24:56.040 --> 25:01.040
The African country of Ghana may be a respite for Black Americans seeking refuge from the

25:01.040 --> 25:05.720
United States' ongoing racial injustice, and Ghanaian officials are actually recruiting

25:05.720 --> 25:07.960
members of the African diaspora.

25:07.960 --> 25:12.880
The government set up a handful of enticements for transplants, including land yields, expatriate

25:12.880 --> 25:18.160
guides, and quicker paths to citizenship, and all of this comes on the heels of a 45%

25:18.160 --> 25:22.160
increase in visitor numbers from the United States last year.

25:22.160 --> 25:27.520
Math, science, and reading are, of course, required subjects for children in school,

25:27.520 --> 25:31.520
and now, in one country, downward dog is too.

25:31.520 --> 25:37.520
In March, Nepal became the first nation in the world to incorporate yoga into its mandatory

25:37.520 --> 25:38.960
curriculum.

25:38.960 --> 25:43.080
Parents in the Himalayan country won't just practice the poses, but they'll learn about

25:43.080 --> 25:46.840
the history of yogic thought and Ayurvedic medicine.

25:46.840 --> 25:52.400
Children, or the idea of them at least, are making headlines in Venezuela, where controversial

25:52.400 --> 25:57.140
Twitter-happy president Nicolas Maduro asks for every woman in the country to have six

25:57.140 --> 25:58.300
children.

25:58.300 --> 26:03.760
The plea was met with immediate backlash because the country is in a deep economic recession,

26:03.760 --> 26:07.720
and is unable to provide essential services like food and healthcare for the millions

26:07.720 --> 26:09.980
of residents it already has.

26:09.980 --> 26:14.560
He apparently views more children as part of the solution, though he offered little

26:14.560 --> 26:17.760
in the way of specifics as to how.

26:17.760 --> 26:19.680
Ever heard of Voltsko's chameleon?

26:19.680 --> 26:20.680
No?

26:20.680 --> 26:24.680
Well, that's okay, almost nobody has since the elusive reptile hadn't been seen in

26:24.680 --> 26:28.720
almost 100 years and was actually placed on the extinction list.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.840
But, this year, a team of researchers spotted it on the northwest tip of Madagascar.

26:33.840 --> 26:38.760
There, the reptile is only thought to live during the rainy season, making it a mayfly

26:38.760 --> 26:39.760
of vertebrae.

26:39.760 --> 26:44.240
This, of course, makes it even more vulnerable to the deforestation that continues to threaten

26:44.240 --> 26:49.400
their sheer existence, but its rediscovery gives scientists hope for other species which

26:49.400 --> 26:51.720
were also thought to be extinct.

26:51.720 --> 26:57.580
The unearthing of four 8,000-year-old skeletons in Cameroon is a groundbreaking find that's

26:57.580 --> 27:01.100
providing new information about our current human species.

27:01.100 --> 27:06.260
The DNA from these skeletons offers the first genetic material from West African humans,

27:06.260 --> 27:11.420
painting a better picture of how ancient people split into four genetic groups, both physically

27:11.420 --> 27:13.060
and geographically.

27:13.060 --> 27:17.180
Of the four populations, it's been the West African genes that have remained elusive to

27:17.180 --> 27:20.060
researchers until now.

27:20.060 --> 27:25.420
Political unrest looms over the Ivory Coast as President Alassane Otaara won, controversially,

27:25.420 --> 27:27.900
a third term in November.

27:27.900 --> 27:32.380
When his planned successor suddenly died this summer, Otaara reneged on his pledge

27:32.380 --> 27:38.660
to leave office, and even though he received 94% of the vote, many, including the opposition,

27:38.660 --> 27:40.260
saw the process as unfair.

27:40.260 --> 27:44.980
It's indicative of a wider trend in African politics, which has seen third-term bids and

27:44.980 --> 27:49.100
constitutional amendments increasing in recent years.

27:49.100 --> 27:54.320
More than 40% of North Korean men smoke, but a new law that bans puffing down in public

27:54.320 --> 27:57.420
places might smolder that statistic.

27:57.420 --> 28:02.820
Citing health reasons, tobacco is now prohibited in specific venues such as political and ideological

28:02.820 --> 28:07.420
education centers, theaters, cinemas, and medical and public health facilities.

28:07.420 --> 28:09.820
One person who might struggle with this new law?

28:09.820 --> 28:14.100
Leader Kim Jong-un, who is a chain-smoker and frequently photographed with a cigarette

28:14.100 --> 28:15.100
in hand.

28:15.100 --> 28:19.500
But, the country is moving forward with the prohibition despite being unable to convince

28:19.500 --> 28:22.660
its supreme leader to kick the habit.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.860
Another big find was recently made by scientists—this time in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast

28:27.300 --> 28:32.700
of Australia—where a pinnacle of coral one-third of a mile long was discovered by researchers.

28:32.700 --> 28:36.300
While you might think that the world-famous natural wonder would be thoroughly mapped

28:36.300 --> 28:41.060
out, this was actually the first major new element of the reef to be discovered in over

28:41.060 --> 28:43.180
120 years.

28:43.180 --> 28:47.540
Of course, the reef is shrinking by the year due to the effects of climate change and coral

28:47.540 --> 28:53.180
bleaching, so even the discovery of this comparatively small section is great news.

28:53.180 --> 28:58.220
Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, but its location also makes it a key regional

28:58.220 --> 29:01.940
recipient of Western aid funding the fight against Islamic terrorism.

29:01.940 --> 29:07.660
That's why an audit of its defense spending that revealed a loss of $137 million over

29:07.660 --> 29:10.420
8 years raised more than eyebrows.

29:10.420 --> 29:15.260
Apparently, the country was overcharged in several instances, sometimes by nearly $20

29:15.260 --> 29:19.900
million, for important military equipment, and Western countries that grant Niger money

29:19.900 --> 29:23.300
are questioning their decisions and potentially future giving.

29:23.300 --> 29:27.740
You don't have to worry about the spread of airborne viruses in Sri Lanka's newest

29:27.740 --> 29:30.740
museum because it's underwater.

29:30.740 --> 29:34.380
Created by naval officers off the southern tip of the island nation, the country's

29:34.380 --> 29:39.140
first ever below-water museum is a collection of artifacts and sculptures installed 50 feet

29:39.140 --> 29:40.660
beneath the surface.

29:40.660 --> 29:45.540
The attraction is not only intended to draw tourists, but it should lure fish and spur

29:45.540 --> 29:47.580
coral growth too.

29:47.580 --> 29:52.620
One of Burkina Faso's largest gold mines was shut down for almost a year after 39 employees

29:52.620 --> 29:55.200
were killed in an attack on their convoy.

29:55.200 --> 29:59.040
Since then, the Canadian-owned Bungu mine has restarted with tightened security measures

29:59.040 --> 30:01.060
and improved infrastructure.

30:01.060 --> 30:04.960
During the year hiatus, the mine's owners actually changed from one Canadian company

30:04.960 --> 30:10.680
to another for $735 million, which is notable because, even though agriculture still accounts

30:10.680 --> 30:15.340
for 80% of the country's economy, gold exports driven by foreign investments continue to

30:15.340 --> 30:18.220
develop alternate economic sectors.

30:18.220 --> 30:22.940
And on the subject of West African unrest, a military coup in Mali ousted the country's

30:22.940 --> 30:27.500
president and prime minister in August, following eight years of disrupted elections, government

30:27.500 --> 30:30.420
corruptions, and Islamic insurgency.

30:30.420 --> 30:33.100
Military colonels remain in power today.

30:33.100 --> 30:37.300
This further instability could send ripple effects across the region because of Mali's

30:37.300 --> 30:41.420
strategic location for Western countries such as France and the United States, which have

30:41.420 --> 30:45.420
actively tried to prevent increased tensions in the area.

30:45.420 --> 30:50.700
File this story under Stranger Than Fiction because, well, it's about non-fiction.

30:50.700 --> 30:55.960
Some 200 books, including first editions by Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton, were found buried

30:55.960 --> 31:00.860
underneath a rural Romanian cottage, after a three-year search that spanned 45 addresses

31:00.860 --> 31:02.500
in three countries.

31:02.500 --> 31:07.740
The $3.35 million worth of books were stolen during a heist from a London warehouse in

31:07.740 --> 31:09.660
2017.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.100
Wanting to get away from it all?

31:11.100 --> 31:17.420
For a cool $20 million, you can buy a 50,000-acre island off the coast of Chile.

31:17.420 --> 31:22.540
Acquiring private islands is nothing new, but this one is making headlines because environmentalists

31:22.540 --> 31:26.980
and the indigenous population are not happy that this biodiversity hotspot has a price

31:26.980 --> 31:28.600
tag at all.

31:28.600 --> 31:32.280
Even though the island has been in private hands for a century, they're worried that

31:32.280 --> 31:37.180
new ownership could jeopardize its future conservation and sets a dangerous precedent.

31:37.700 --> 31:42.820
In an effort to bolster its economy, Malawi became the fifth African country to decriminalize

31:42.820 --> 31:44.620
medical marijuana.

31:44.620 --> 31:48.740
Almost 80% of the country's population is employed in agriculture, and it used to be

31:48.740 --> 31:53.760
a major producer of tobacco, but, as global demand for tobacco declines, it's looking

31:53.760 --> 31:55.780
for alternate revenue streams.

31:55.780 --> 32:00.460
Enter Malawi gold, an already popular strain of recreational cannabis.

32:00.460 --> 32:05.140
The country's dry climate is actually conducive to growing marijuana, and as the herb's

32:05.140 --> 32:10.740
popularity increases around the world, Malawians plan to jump on the ganja train.

32:10.740 --> 32:15.700
Kazakhstan is known for a few things—its oil and gas economy, its proximity to Russia

32:15.700 --> 32:20.220
and Mongolia, and just generally for being a stan—but in Western culture, it's perhaps

32:20.220 --> 32:24.900
most famous for one of its fictional natives, Borat Sagdiev.

32:24.900 --> 32:29.640
Played by actor Sacha Baron Cohen, the satirical character Borat pokes fun at Kazakhstan with

32:29.640 --> 32:34.140
the catchphrase, very nice, but officials there realize those words have standing power,

32:34.140 --> 32:38.440
and recently officially adopted them as their official tourism slogan.

32:38.440 --> 32:43.780
The African Ansel mole rat, native to Zambia, is near-blind, burrows underground, and this

32:43.780 --> 32:48.420
year, scientists discovered it can sense magnetic fields with its eyes.

32:48.420 --> 32:52.900
Though the animal's eyes are barely functional, discerning between just light and dark, this

32:52.900 --> 32:57.340
new discovery gives more clues as to how the creature travels and lives in an underground

32:57.340 --> 33:02.860
network up to 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers long, and of course, it may help humans in

33:02.860 --> 33:08.180
our own scientific advances, as we learn more about nature, and as we often do, try

33:08.180 --> 33:09.780
to mimic it.

33:09.780 --> 33:14.540
Government officials in Guatemala passed a $12.2 billion budget that raised stipends

33:14.540 --> 33:18.460
for representatives' meals, while cutting funding for human rights agencies, health

33:18.460 --> 33:22.860
care, and education, triggering residents to protest in the streets and set the congressional

33:22.860 --> 33:24.700
building on fire.

33:24.700 --> 33:28.980
Their anger at the misplaced spending comes on the heels of not only the pandemic, but

33:28.980 --> 33:32.780
two destructive hurricanes that tore through the country this fall.

33:32.780 --> 33:37.360
It turns out, tragedy after tragedy is when people need help the most.

33:37.360 --> 33:41.980
In July, Ecuador reported that more than 300 Chinese fishing vessels were encroaching on

33:41.980 --> 33:46.260
its exclusive fishing zones near the Galapagos, with the illegal fishing fleets going as far

33:46.260 --> 33:49.540
as to turn off their tracking devices to remain undetected.

33:49.540 --> 33:54.500
So, the South American country joined coastal neighbors Chile, Peru, and Colombia to file

33:54.500 --> 33:59.400
a joint statement—or rather, a light threat—about protecting their waters from the increasing

33:59.400 --> 34:04.120
creep of foreign fishing and, ultimately, China's expanding presence.

34:04.120 --> 34:08.320
Overseas, some new research into the life of the Netherlands' most famous artist,

34:08.320 --> 34:12.640
Vincent van Gogh, reveals that he didn't suffer from schizophrenia or syphilis, as

34:12.640 --> 34:16.960
some have theorized, but rather that the delirium leading up to his death may be attributed

34:16.960 --> 34:18.740
to alcohol withdrawal.

34:18.740 --> 34:23.840
The artist was institutionalized twice—once after cutting off his ear—and reported hallucinations

34:23.840 --> 34:25.660
both times.

34:25.660 --> 34:29.280
Researchers now believe these symptoms were due to his lack of wine and absinthe, which

34:29.280 --> 34:34.860
he consumed in great amounts during the most prolific, and final, years of his life.

34:34.860 --> 34:41.180
In somber news, Syria topped an unenviable list in 2019, being named the deadliest place

34:41.180 --> 34:43.700
in the world for humanitarian workers.

34:43.700 --> 34:48.240
The report on the subject, released this year, details that the number of people killed helping

34:48.240 --> 34:52.940
the war-torn country rose sharply last year, with the majority of deaths stemming from

34:52.940 --> 34:54.500
aerial strikes.

34:54.500 --> 34:59.020
Officials say the grim statistic will make it harder to recruit aid workers to a place

34:59.020 --> 35:01.460
where they're needed the most.

35:01.460 --> 35:06.140
One rodent that's turning its species' reputation around is Magawa, a landmine-sniffing

35:06.140 --> 35:08.060
rat in Cambodia.

35:08.060 --> 35:13.100
The five-year-old African pouched rat has discovered 39 landmines, 28 pieces of unexploded

35:13.100 --> 35:18.540
ordnance, and helped clear more than 1.5 million square feet of land over the past four years,

35:18.540 --> 35:22.980
rightfully earning itself the gold medal from the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals.

35:22.980 --> 35:28.060
That, unsurprisingly, makes it the first rat to receive an award that is usually reserved

35:28.060 --> 35:29.780
for humans.

35:29.780 --> 35:35.380
After the tragic port explosion in Beirut, Senegal moved quickly to avoid a similar catastrophe

35:35.380 --> 35:40.000
and removed 3,050 tons of ammonium nitrate from its port.

35:40.000 --> 35:45.260
The substance was transported to Mali, where it was used to make bombs for mining operations.

35:45.260 --> 35:49.960
Ammonium nitrate is commonly found in fertilizers and explosives, so ports around the world

35:49.960 --> 35:54.600
which temporarily house the volatile compound, such as Senegal's Dakar, made sure they

35:54.600 --> 35:58.560
weren't in the same vulnerable situation as Beirut, where the substance led to the

35:58.560 --> 36:02.200
accidental explosion that killed 190 people.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.960
South African extrative economies continue to make headlines, such as Chad, which recently

36:06.960 --> 36:13.360
asked UNESCO to postpone the process for designating Lake Chad as a World Heritage Site.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.360
Why?

36:14.360 --> 36:18.760
Because Chad wants to explore oil and gas development in the lake area, which directly

36:18.760 --> 36:22.920
opposes UNESCO's conservation goals for World Heritage Sites.

36:22.920 --> 36:28.320
It also came as a surprise to Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, which cooperated on the two-year

36:28.320 --> 36:33.800
application process for the multinational lake to gain this distinctive designation.

36:33.800 --> 36:39.000
More fish theft brings us to the coast of Somalia, which stretches 2,000 miles or 3,200

36:39.000 --> 36:42.480
kilometers and is the longest coastline in Africa.

36:42.480 --> 36:46.520
That expanse makes it harder for the country to police its waters, where poachers like

36:46.520 --> 36:51.760
a 192-vessel fleet from Iran are illegally fishing in the country's exclusive economic

36:51.760 --> 36:52.860
zone.

36:52.860 --> 36:57.960
The size of the Iranian operation, discovered this year, is a blow to Somalia, where one

36:57.960 --> 37:02.980
in three residents face hunger, and it demonstrates the rising tensions over the planet's limited

37:02.980 --> 37:05.360
natural resources.

37:05.360 --> 37:09.880
One resource being exported out of Africa that benefits from increased demand is a Zimbabwean

37:09.880 --> 37:13.900
film that became the country's first feature to make it to Netflix.

37:13.900 --> 37:18.340
The movie, Cook-Off, is about a woman who enters a TV cooking show, and it was made

37:18.340 --> 37:24.360
for just $8,000—an impressive feat given that it was produced in 2017, just before

37:24.360 --> 37:26.660
the country's economy collapsed.

37:26.660 --> 37:31.220
This acquisition by the streaming giant gives more credibility to Zimbabwe's film industry,

37:31.220 --> 37:36.040
and means that the production crew and actors may finally get paid.

37:36.040 --> 37:40.300
A small band of chimpanzees in Guinea that are known for their remarkable use of tools

37:40.300 --> 37:44.940
were thought to be near extinction, until the tribe's last fertile female gave birth

37:44.940 --> 37:48.220
to a beacon of hope—another female.

37:48.220 --> 37:53.420
Deforestation and isolation led to the tribe's demise, and this group is of particular interest

37:53.420 --> 37:57.100
to researchers because they mimic humans' use of tools.

37:57.100 --> 38:00.980
But this bundle of joy has also created momentum for the country's residents to increase

38:00.980 --> 38:06.540
protections and forestation to ensure there is a future for the chimpanzees.

38:06.780 --> 38:10.500
One of the world's most wanted fugitives was found this year in a small apartment on

38:10.500 --> 38:12.180
the outskirts of Paris.

38:12.180 --> 38:17.660
Felicia Cabuga was arrested for his role in the Rwandan genocide, which killed 800,000

38:17.660 --> 38:22.340
members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, among others, in 1994.

38:22.340 --> 38:27.320
Cabuga will be tried in a UN tribunal court next year, and this capture renews efforts

38:27.320 --> 38:33.300
to find others on the run who played significant roles in the country's darkest days.

38:33.300 --> 38:38.100
France and Benin also made news in 2020, with the former's government fast-tracking a

38:38.100 --> 38:42.760
bill aimed at returning looted objects to the sub-Saharan country within a year.

38:42.760 --> 38:46.620
The move is part of a multi-year restitution effort between European countries and their

38:46.620 --> 38:51.160
former colonies, and this law specifically returns 26 royal artifacts that were stolen

38:51.160 --> 38:54.340
from the Abomi Palace during the 19th century.

38:54.340 --> 38:58.980
These cultural repatriation efforts are ongoing, signaling an African drive to reclaim its

38:58.980 --> 39:03.580
cultural identity after centuries of European pillaging.

39:03.580 --> 39:07.800
Efforts to protect sea turtles in Tunisia are working, says new scientific research

39:07.800 --> 39:14.180
that shows nests on Kiryat Island have increased from 11 to more than 40 since 1997.

39:14.180 --> 39:18.260
Turtles are a keystone species, meaning their disappearance would disproportionately damage

39:18.260 --> 39:23.480
ecosystems, and their increased presence in this area, despite threats from people, climate,

39:23.480 --> 39:28.920
and pollution, is good news for the reptiles and the workers striving to save them.

39:28.920 --> 39:33.800
Two Chinese bidders, with the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman, bought a Belgian racing

39:33.800 --> 39:38.400
pigeon for a record price of $1.9 million.

39:38.400 --> 39:44.180
Belgium is the world's leading racing pigeon-breeding country and, thanks to a booming economy,

39:44.180 --> 39:50.160
the Chinese upper class have a lot of money to spend even compared to a decade ago, so

39:50.160 --> 39:52.660
why not invest in something like a pigeon?

39:52.660 --> 39:57.120
The bird will likely be bred with another genetically superior pigeon to create a superbird

39:57.120 --> 40:01.520
that will dominate in racing circles, and betting on those is just one area where the

40:01.520 --> 40:05.040
Chinese are spending significant amounts of their yuan.

40:05.040 --> 40:10.520
11 months in Argentina sounds nice, but for Bolivian president Evo Morales, it was more

40:10.520 --> 40:11.680
of an exile.

40:11.680 --> 40:16.200
He reentered Bolivia this November, after a 2019 campaign for a fourth presidential

40:16.200 --> 40:20.600
term became marred by fraud allegations, leading him to flee the country.

40:20.600 --> 40:25.280
A caretaker government has managed affairs since then, but when Morales' former economic

40:25.280 --> 40:29.560
minister recently assumed leadership, it paved the way for Morales to return, though

40:29.560 --> 40:33.240
it's unclear what role he'll play in the country's new reality.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.520
If it all sounds turbulent, it is.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.640
Latin American countries continue to struggle with government instability, and this is just

40:39.640 --> 40:42.440
one more on the list.

40:42.440 --> 40:47.200
The financial situation in Cuba worsened this year, when the United States placed increased

40:47.200 --> 40:52.520
restrictions on the country, forcing the closure of 400 Western Union offices, and potentially

40:52.520 --> 40:55.560
cutting off a stream of remittances from abroad.

40:55.560 --> 40:59.280
The United States claims the move came in response to the Cuban government purportedly

40:59.280 --> 41:04.120
siphoning a cut of the incoming money, but officials there say the move was politically

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
motivated.

41:05.120 --> 41:09.680
Cuban-American relations have become more tenuous under Trump, but the new Biden administration

41:09.680 --> 41:14.760
is expected to reinstate diplomatic relations, especially since Cuban refugee Alejandro Mayorkas

41:14.760 --> 41:18.160
has been nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

41:18.160 --> 41:22.520
Popping one island over, Haiti's local president of FIFA, the governing body for

41:22.520 --> 41:26.160
soccer, has been shut out and not in the winning way.

41:26.160 --> 41:30.520
Haitian football president Yves Jean-Barre was issued a lifetime ban from all football-related

41:30.520 --> 41:35.720
activities after he was found guilty of sexually harassing and abusing female players, including

41:35.720 --> 41:36.720
minors.

41:36.720 --> 41:40.540
He was also fined roughly $1.1 million.

41:40.540 --> 41:45.080
Many are lauding the punishment, saying abuse should be rooted out of any industry at any

41:45.080 --> 41:46.400
level.

41:46.680 --> 41:51.000
South Sudan is the world's youngest country, formed in 2011.

41:51.000 --> 41:55.780
Since then, it's experienced almost a decade of civil war, but earlier this year, feuding

41:55.780 --> 41:58.940
parties finally signed a unity agreement.

41:58.940 --> 42:02.920
Millions of people continue to flee the country and suffer from extreme hunger, but the establishment

42:02.920 --> 42:08.440
of a ruling party offers one step in the right direction toward stability.

42:08.440 --> 42:14.020
President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 55.

42:14.020 --> 42:18.320
He leaves behind a legacy as an autocratic ruler known for committing a variety of human

42:18.320 --> 42:22.980
rights abuses, and his death in June came just weeks after the country had already elected

42:22.980 --> 42:27.960
a successor, which only happened because Nkurunziza did not seek re-election.

42:27.960 --> 42:32.140
His death will have impacts on regional and global relations, potentially allowing for

42:32.140 --> 42:35.660
increased unity under new leadership.

42:35.660 --> 42:40.060
Despite the pandemic, the Dominican Republic has hosted more than two dozen feature film

42:40.060 --> 42:44.980
and TV production shoots this year, which poured $80 million into the local economy,

42:44.980 --> 42:50.100
smashing a previous annual record of $30 million in 2017.

42:50.100 --> 42:53.840
Producers track their local expenditures because part of the country's international incentive

42:53.840 --> 42:58.180
for filming there is a 25% rebate through a transferable tax credit.

42:58.180 --> 43:02.340
That's attractive to American filmmakers, like M. Night Shyamalan, who took advantage

43:02.340 --> 43:07.040
of it this year, because they can spend 25% of wages in the Dominican Republic and maintain

43:07.040 --> 43:10.480
tax incentive status in the United States.

43:10.480 --> 43:14.160
A deer stealing their rifle isn't something that hunters would think they'd have to

43:14.160 --> 43:18.560
worry about when out stalking, but that's what happened to one in the Czech Republic

43:18.560 --> 43:23.800
when his dog startled the deer, which ran toward him and looped his rifle with an antler.

43:23.800 --> 43:27.200
The deer was seen a mile away, with the gun still in tow.

43:27.200 --> 43:31.920
Reportedly, it wasn't loaded, but had it been, a deer claiming self-defense might have

43:31.920 --> 43:33.920
worked in this case.

43:33.920 --> 43:38.440
Still filed under bizarre sightings is a tiny child floating on an inflatable unicorn in

43:38.440 --> 43:40.040
the Mediterranean Sea.

43:40.040 --> 43:44.280
The three-year-old girl was swept into the water while playing on a beach in Greece,

43:44.280 --> 43:47.220
but rescued shortly after by a passing ferryboat.

43:47.220 --> 43:52.240
She was delivered back to her family safely, and yes, the unicorn made it too.

43:52.240 --> 43:57.780
When Brazilian Maya Guevara surfed a 73.5 foot or 22.4 meter wave off the coast of Portugal

43:57.780 --> 44:02.480
in February, she didn't just ride the biggest wave ever for a woman, it was the largest

44:02.480 --> 44:07.580
wave surfed by anyone, period, during the 2019-2020 season.

44:07.580 --> 44:12.000
She is the first woman in professional surfing to top all men in terms of wave size in a

44:12.000 --> 44:16.920
season, but with another female surfer earning spot number two on the big wave list this

44:16.920 --> 44:20.440
year, it's clear she may not hold the title for long.

44:20.440 --> 44:24.600
The title for the highest smoking rate in the world goes to Jordan, where a shocking

44:24.600 --> 44:30.020
80% of the male population says they use smoke or use nicotine products daily.

44:30.020 --> 44:35.060
This was a status previously held by Indonesia, and bucked the global trend of declining tobacco

44:35.060 --> 44:36.060
use.

44:36.060 --> 44:39.820
Multinational tobacco companies are still allowed to hold a large amount of influence

44:39.820 --> 44:43.780
in Jordan, from funding school programs to being featured on the Prime Minister's social

44:43.780 --> 44:49.140
media, and this widespread interference is likely what's increasing use.

44:49.140 --> 44:54.660
Rapper Cardi B may have overstepped her political boundaries when she posted an advertisement

44:54.660 --> 44:59.080
supporting Armenia to her 76 million Instagram followers.

44:59.140 --> 45:03.960
Unlike all wars, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been a tragic one that ended

45:03.960 --> 45:08.180
with Armenia's defeat in a pact between the two countries over the disputed territory

45:08.180 --> 45:11.920
of Nagorno-Karabakhsh, which will remain with Azerbaijan.

45:11.920 --> 45:16.200
But Cardi B was only trying to help a real estate agent friend when she made the post,

45:16.200 --> 45:19.520
and has since apologized amid the backlash.

45:19.520 --> 45:24.180
Unstaffed grocery stores accessed by logging in with BankID, the national identification

45:24.180 --> 45:28.460
app operated by Sweden's banks, seems like something only Sweden could pull off in remote

45:28.460 --> 45:32.260
areas, which is why they're probably the ones doing it.

45:32.260 --> 45:37.000
Amid a drastic decline in food markets across the country, mostly in rural areas, the company

45:37.000 --> 45:42.660
Livs has installed almost 20 small container stores that are fully stocked with meat, vegetables,

45:42.660 --> 45:44.340
dairy, and desserts.

45:44.340 --> 45:49.660
Customers simply swipe an app to enter and pay for groceries, no store clerk needed.

45:49.660 --> 45:53.020
Israeli flights traveling to and from the United Arab Emirates can now cross through

45:53.020 --> 45:57.300
Saudi Arabian airspace, marking the first time that commercial jets on this route can

45:57.300 --> 45:59.420
pass over the Kingdom's territory.

45:59.420 --> 46:02.700
The announcement cuts travel time between the two countries in half, to three and a

46:02.700 --> 46:08.460
half hours, and signals normalizing relations, both diplomatically and economically.

46:08.460 --> 46:13.220
According to reports, the decision to open the airspace came at the request of the UAE.

46:13.220 --> 46:18.860
It became the third Arab country to acknowledge relations with Israel, behind Egypt and Jordan,

46:18.860 --> 46:23.020
and the development signals some progress in an otherwise unstable region, though Saudi

46:23.020 --> 46:27.420
Arabia was quick to note that opening airspace didn't change the country's stance on

46:27.420 --> 46:30.140
the Israel-Palestine issue.

46:30.140 --> 46:35.380
Despite having previously faced murder charges, Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, aka the Tiger,

46:35.380 --> 46:38.380
was still named police chief in 2012 in Honduras.

46:38.380 --> 46:42.900
So, it may not come as a surprise that he didn't uphold the tenets of the job, and

46:42.900 --> 46:47.820
is now charged with conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States, but the plot

46:47.820 --> 46:48.820
thickens.

46:48.820 --> 46:52.900
He wasn't smuggling cocaine for just anyone, but doing the dirty work for the Honduran

46:52.900 --> 46:56.580
president and his brother, the latter of which was convicted for drug trafficking in

46:56.580 --> 46:58.900
New York last year.

46:58.900 --> 47:05.460
In Hungary, a scientist accidentally created a new fish hybrid in a lab dubbed the sturtlefish.

47:05.460 --> 47:10.180
The combination of Russian sturgeon, whose eggs make premium caviar, and American paddlefish,

47:10.180 --> 47:14.460
a filter feeder found in less than half of the United States, is an unlikely one that

47:14.460 --> 47:19.340
would probably never have occurred without human intervention, based on geography alone.

47:19.340 --> 47:23.740
And while there's no real practical purpose to the awkward-looking creature, it does demonstrate

47:23.740 --> 47:28.460
that species' genetics are sometimes more similar than previously thought.

47:28.460 --> 47:34.660
Also in the neighborhood is the proposed Baltic Black Sea Waterway—a 12,040-mile, 2,000-kilometer

47:34.660 --> 47:38.780
inland shipping route that would cut through Poland, Ukraine, and some of the most ecologically

47:38.780 --> 47:40.340
rich parts of Belarus.

47:40.340 --> 47:44.500
Oh, and it would involve dredging up land inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, which

47:44.500 --> 47:48.340
could potentially expose millions of people to latent nuclear waste.

47:48.340 --> 47:52.140
Proponents say it would spur an economic boom for the region, while opponents argue

47:52.140 --> 47:55.140
it will destroy the quote, Amazon of Europe.

47:55.140 --> 47:59.140
It may end up happening piecemeal, with Ukraine and Belarus committing, and already starting

47:59.140 --> 48:03.540
in some cases, to dredging up parts of their tributary rivers.

48:03.540 --> 48:07.920
Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in East Asia, and many residents cross into

48:07.920 --> 48:11.320
Russia for higher-paying jobs and higher education.

48:11.320 --> 48:16.300
The Russian-speaking population in this country has dwindled tenfold in four decades, but

48:16.300 --> 48:20.180
there's new interest in teaching children their neighbor's language, marked by officials'

48:20.180 --> 48:24.100
announcement that they would build five more Russian-speaking schools, with a capacity

48:24.100 --> 48:28.680
for 1,200 students in each, in addition to the ten that have been constructed in just

48:28.680 --> 48:30.860
the past two years.

48:30.860 --> 48:36.300
A musician in Austria is pulling a different sort of string—that of Wolfgang Amadeus

48:36.300 --> 48:39.060
Mozart's 250-year-old violin.

48:39.060 --> 48:42.940
The musician took a leap when he asked the foundation that owns the violin if he could

48:42.940 --> 48:47.800
borrow it to play and record the violin concertos on the exact instrument Mozart composed them

48:47.800 --> 48:51.140
on between 1773 and 1775.

48:51.140 --> 48:56.700
The answer was yes, and he performed them in October to small, live audiences.

48:56.700 --> 49:01.020
A group of United Nations officials signed a letter to four countries protesting the

49:01.020 --> 49:05.300
development of a massive mine in Papua New Guinea, citing grave concerns both for the

49:05.300 --> 49:07.700
environment and human rights.

49:07.700 --> 49:11.780
If built, the mine would be the largest in the nation's history, and potentially produce

49:11.780 --> 49:16.740
$1.5 billion of gold, copper, and silver annually for 30 years.

49:16.740 --> 49:20.860
But that money would mostly go to Chinese investors in the Australian Registered Mining

49:20.860 --> 49:24.820
Company, and the real costs would come in the form of catastrophic economic disaster

49:24.820 --> 49:28.300
on the Sepik River, where it would be located.

49:28.300 --> 49:33.440
More than 43 million tweets amplifying positive news coverage of Serbian President Aleksandr

49:33.440 --> 49:38.500
Vucic were linked to his Serbian Progressive Party, and Twitter subsequently blocked 8,500

49:38.500 --> 49:41.360
accounts for attempts to undermine public conversation.

49:41.360 --> 49:45.740
The tweets were making his governing look better than it actually was, and this isn't

49:45.740 --> 49:47.220
just happening in Serbia.

49:47.220 --> 49:51.880
The tech company blocked some additional 13,000 accounts in countries like Egypt, Honduras,

49:51.880 --> 49:55.960
and Saudi Arabia for doing the same thing.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.840
Serbia is the 98th largest country in the world, meaning we're halfway to 195.

50:00.840 --> 50:06.160
Therefore, that's where we'll end part one, and part two will be going up December

50:06.160 --> 50:07.160
31st.

50:07.160 --> 50:11.340
While you wait for that, though, I have something else, new and rather exciting, for you to

50:11.340 --> 50:12.340
watch.

50:12.340 --> 50:17.600
Tomorrow, on Nebula, we release the first episode of Sam from Wendover Presents, a very

50:17.600 --> 50:19.700
good trivia show presented by Sam from Wendover.

50:19.700 --> 50:24.460
You see, we were going to film something for our last Nebula Original of the year on location,

50:24.460 --> 50:27.860
like we normally do, but then, you know, everything got in the way.

50:27.860 --> 50:30.060
Can't break our C-word rule now.

50:30.060 --> 50:35.440
Therefore, we decided to do something completely different—a trivia show, filmed remotely,

50:35.440 --> 50:40.140
with three fantastic contestants—Brian from Real Engineering, Dave from City Beautiful,

50:40.140 --> 50:41.140
and Jordan Harrod.

50:41.140 --> 50:45.360
They competed in seven games, some of which were pretty normal, and others of which were

50:45.360 --> 50:47.120
pretty out there.

50:47.120 --> 50:51.480
This was all hosted by me, and I even go on camera, so get mentally prepared for that.

50:51.480 --> 50:55.900
Of course, the only place to watch this is on Nebula, as their business model makes bigger

50:55.900 --> 50:59.940
projects like this financially possible, and there's quite literally never been a better

50:59.940 --> 51:01.140
time to sign up.

51:01.140 --> 51:06.900
That's because our sponsor, CuriosityStream, is having its biggest ever sale—41% off,

51:06.900 --> 51:12.000
meaning it works out to less than $1 a month, and by signing up at CuriosityStream.com

51:12.000 --> 51:16.700
slash Wendover, any subscription is bundled with a Nebula subscription for the exact same

51:16.700 --> 51:17.700
price.

51:17.700 --> 51:22.320
That's two whole streaming sites, with thousands of top-quality documentaries and non-fiction

51:22.320 --> 51:27.000
shows from bigger names, in the case of CuriosityStream, and tons of bigger-budget projects from your

51:27.000 --> 51:31.060
favorite educational-ish creators, in the case of Nebula, for less than the cost of

51:31.060 --> 51:33.060
a bus fare per month.

51:33.060 --> 51:36.660
While you wait for our original to come out, you could, for example, watch something quite

51:36.660 --> 51:41.920
similar to this video—it's where CuriosityStream rounds up the top science stories of 2020

51:41.920 --> 51:45.280
in an hour-long special, which is quite good.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.540
This sale will end very soon, so make sure to sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover,

51:49.540 --> 51:53.580
and you'll be supporting this and countless other independent channels while you're

51:53.580 --> 51:53.600
at it.
