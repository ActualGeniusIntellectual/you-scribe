1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,980
In 2020, one singularity dominated the news.

2
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:11,940
There was one story that filled almost every front page of every paper on every day.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:18,180
If I asked you what was the biggest story from 2019, or 2018, or 17, or almost any other

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,880
year was, there'd be some debate.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,880
But not in 2020.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,780
I don't even have to tell you what I'm talking about.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,540
You already know.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,300
But just because the front pages were clogged up, that's not to say page two, three, or

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,300
four were.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,420
While we may have stood still, the world kept spinning, and news kept happening.

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,980
Some of it was heavy, some was sad, some was bizarre, and some momentous, but what binds

12
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:47,160
these stories together is that you likely didn't hear about them.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,060
By no fault of your own, it was difficult to follow what was happening in the world,

14
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,600
because the only thing you could hear was that one singular story.

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,040
The year's not over yet, though, at least as I'm saying this, and so there's still

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,560
a chance to catch up on the news you missed in 2020 from every country in the world.

17
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,460
Here's how this'll work.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,200
We order the countries by population from largest to smallest according to 2019's

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,400
statistics.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,760
There are 195 of them—193 countries recognized by the United Nations, plus two UN observer

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,060
states—Palestine and the Vatican City.

22
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,500
This list was chosen because it is the most definitive list—it's the list most commonly

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,060
used as a list of all countries—so some of its entries might include nations that

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,100
you or your government do not consider as countries, or omit ones that you or your government

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,100
do recognize.

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,780
At the end of the day, we had to pick a list, and if any is the list of countries, it's

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,780
this one.

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,300
Oh, and one more rule—the C-word, as in, the word that describes that one singular

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,360
story of 2020—you're not going to hear it once.

30
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,560
We start in China—the most populated country in the world, which continues to expand its

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,080
global presence, and in this case, its space presence too.

32
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,060
It became the second country in the world to plant a national flag on the moon, 50 years

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,240
after the United States did.

34
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,880
China is trying to catch up with American and Russian planetary endeavors and, in recent

35
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,920
years, has poured millions into its military-run space program with the hopes of sending humans

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,160
to the moon.

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,520
Another country with a burgeoning space program is India, where Amazon recently completed

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,040
its largest office building in the world.

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,160
The 1.8 million square foot behemoth was erected in Hyderabad, a city of 10 million that's

40
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,320
grown into a sizable technology and financial hub.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,960
India, as the world's second most-populized country, is the fastest growing internet market

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,520
and Amazon joins other major tech multinationals which have open offices there, though none

43
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,560
with a campus that spans 65 football fields.

44
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,800
A United States man that was facing sentencing for two vehicle theft charges might be looking

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,640
at a lot more time now that he was caught faking his death.

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,560
His attorney submitted a fraudulent death certificate, and it might have passed had

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,240
there not been typos, like the misspelling of registry—stay in school, kids.

48
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,340
In Indonesia, a stimulus bill aimed at restarting Southeast Asia's largest economy was met

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,160
with months of protests because citizens said it slashed workers' rights and environmental

50
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
regulations.

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:20,200
But, President Joko Widodo signed the bill into law anyway, saying it will bring over

52
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,600
1 million jobs to the struggling economy, which until this year had been on an upward

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
trajectory.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,560
Opponents, though, argue it weakens rules that already don't do enough to protect

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,760
the country's natural resources and workers.

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,040
Rice is a serious business in Southern Asia, and it's a profitable one too.

57
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,120
That's why Pakistan is vehemently fighting India over the long grain—Basmati, to be

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,200
specific.

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,500
This year, India applied to the European Union for a designation that recognizes basmati

60
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,440
rice as an exclusive export of the country, even though one-third of EU imports on the

61
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,360
product come from Pakistan.

62
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,720
In recent years, Pakistan's basmati rice exports to the EU have doubled while India's

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,360
are shrinking, which makes the designation, if granted, potentially more devastating and

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,540
further increases tensions between these two neighbors.

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:13,180
Between rainforest fires and a negligent president, the news streaming out of Brazil has been

66
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,180
heavy.

67
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,680
But, a new discovery about the mating habits of the theropotophora frog lightened the feed.

68
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,440
Frogs are either typically monogamous or not, meaning they get around.

69
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,380
This species, however, prefers harem-style—one male to two or more specific females—which

70
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,940
is much more common in mammals throughout the animal kingdom, but not seen before in

71
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,300
amphibians.

72
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,020
Dubbed group fidelity, finding this behavior in another set of four-legged animals checks

73
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,340
another box in the evolutionary list.

74
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,020
One particular virus has dominated the news cycle this year, but in Nigeria, they're

75
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,100
dealing with an entirely different one, too—the yellow fever.

76
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,740
The disease, which is spread by mosquitoes, had basically been eradicated for 20 years

77
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,780
until 2017, when it crept back into the country because of climate change and lower vaccination

78
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
rates.

79
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,500
Now, it's spiking.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,300
In the latter half of 2020, 75 people have already died, and health officials worry that

81
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,460
number will increase as people are still hesitant to get vaccinated.

82
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,140
India is being beat in another metric as well, and it's an important one.

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,700
Bangladesh most likely surpassed India in gross domestic product this year according

84
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,220
to International Monetary Fund estimates.

85
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,300
Why does that matter?

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,640
Well, India is the world's sixth-largest economy, and its 10% GDP contraction is a

87
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,740
concerning indicator for the world economy.

88
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,200
Thanks to increased agricultural production and a focus on developing its low-wage labor

89
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:48,140
workforce, Bangladesh, on the other hand, was able to expand its GDP by 4% this year.

90
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,980
Another country that's known to be slightly competitive is Russia, and that's a problem

91
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,660
since they were banned from the biggest global sporting competition of 2020 because of doping.

92
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,780
That would be the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

93
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,860
Of course, the event was postponed until 2021 anyway, but new investigations reveal that

94
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,180
Russia was planning to cyber-attack the games, which is something they've done before when

95
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,520
they attempted to wreak havoc on the Winter Olympics in South Korea by dismantling ticketing

96
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,440
and wifi for the opening ceremony, as well as targeting individual broadcasters, sponsors,

97
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,940
and athletes.

98
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,740
Before flights were ground to a halt in the spring, one health insurer in Utah was taking

99
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,540
advantage of Mexico's inexpensive pharmaceutical prices and actually flying public employees

100
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,100
from the United States to south of the border so they could buy drugs at a fraction of American

101
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
prices.

102
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,020
They also got the benefit of those in-flight snack peanuts and a free soda.

103
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,220
It's already saved the company a quarter of a million dollars, and now other states

104
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,460
are eyeing the move, and may mimic it once flight schedules resume to normal levels,

105
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,460
meaning Mexico is bound to see an even greater boost to its already burgeoning pharmaceutical

106
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
tourism industry.

107
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,220
Fugaku is not just fun to say, it's also the name of the world's speediest computer,

108
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,000
which was built this year in Japan.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,460
The room-sized computer took first place in a speed-ranking competition between supercomputers,

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,080
carrying out 2.8 times more calculations than the second-place IBM machine built in the

111
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
United States.

112
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,460
This is notable for the Japanese, who have remained less competitive in the supercomputer

113
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,240
realm, often following the leads of the US and China.

114
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,460
The systems are used for complex military and scientific tasks, including breaking code

115
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,120
and modeling climate change, and, of course, winning competitions.

116
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,980
Africa is getting its own Great Wall—a green one.

117
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,980
The ambitious reforestation project is supposed to stretch 4,350 miles or 7,000 kilometers

118
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,860
from Djibouti to Senegal, with an aimed completion date of 2030.

119
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:50,700
Ethiopia is on track to meet its goal, having already planted 5.5 billion seedlings.

120
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,940
But, its neighbors are slow to start, and the project is only 4% complete at the halfway

121
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,100
mark, mostly due to financial struggles.

122
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,460
It turns out, it takes a lot of green to make a green wall, and so it's proving difficult

123
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,460
for some of the world's poorest countries to take this project to completion.

124
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,820
Money problems are also the reason that the Philippines' largest news network cited,

125
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,440
when it shuttered dozens of its regional stations around the country, but the audience isn't

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,900
buying this excuse.

127
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,340
Instead, they're wondering if it has more to do with President Rodrigo Duterte's criticism

128
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,700
of the network's coverage of his anti-drug platform.

129
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,720
Either way, the loss will be felt by millions of rural residents who rely on the network

130
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,420
as a lifeline for critical information.

131
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:42,260
Wealthy residents of Egypt are getting their 15 minutes of fame just 2,500 years too late.

132
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,300
More than 100 ornately painted wooden coffins were unearthed by archaeologists near Saqqara,

133
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,620
20 miles or 30 kilometers south of Cairo.

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,380
This area is a large burial ground and is home to more than a dozen sites with similar

135
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
tombs.

136
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,380
This discovery, however, is one of the most exciting in recent years and comes at a time

137
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,600
when the country continues to try to draw tourists back after a sharp decline resulting

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,020
from the Arab Spring in the early 2010s.

139
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,220
Tourism isn't a problem in Vietnam, where 18 million people visit per year, and that

140
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,780
should mean liquor sales aren't either, but a new zero-tolerance drunk-driving law

141
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,620
that went into effect this year has taken the fizz out of one of the world's faster-growing

142
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,140
beer markets.

143
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:29,700
Since implementation, beer sales have dropped 25% in the country, and violators face a fine

144
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,040
of up to $345, which is double what the average Vietnamese makes in a month.

145
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,300
Even those who think riding a bike is a safe alternative will be shocked with a $25 fine

146
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
for drunk pedaling.

147
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,860
In other 2020 epidemic news, the World Health Organization declared that an Ebola outbreak

148
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,660
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was officially over after two years and 2,280

149
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,660
deaths.

150
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,040
It was the country's tenth outbreak of the disease, but it's second most deadly, stemming

151
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,140
from people's mistrust of the government and feuding between officials.

152
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,220
That doesn't mean the country is in the clear, though, as it's now dealing with

153
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,540
the world's largest measles epidemic and, of course, the global pandemic.

154
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,740
Germans are taking a stand in, well, technically a sit in Dannenruder Forest, south of Frankfurt,

155
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,180
where they've been camped out to oppose the government's construction of a highway

156
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,300
that will route through the wildlands and cut down 67 acres, or 27 hectares, of 250-year-old

157
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
trees.

158
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,200
These activists are calling the government hypocritical for cutting down cherished trees

159
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,100
when it should focus on public transportation infrastructure, and both sides expect standoffs

160
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,080
for months to come.

161
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,000
Also bad news for trees are the more than 9 million that have died in Turkey.

162
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,480
Last year, as part of National Forestation Day, volunteers across the country planted

163
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:58,320
11 million trees across more than 2,000 sites, including 303,150 saplings planted in Kouroum,

164
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,280
which broke the world record for most trees planted in a single location.

165
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:07,200
Now officials are reporting that up to 90% of these have died because they either weren't

166
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,540
planted properly or lacked enough rainfall to grow.

167
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:15,120
In neighboring Iran, a woman was filmed riding a bike without a hijab near a major mosque

168
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,460
in Nayefabad.

169
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,460
Why is this news?

170
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:23,400
Well, in Iran, it's been against Islamic law since 1979 for women to be seen in public

171
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,040
without a covering for their head and hair, and this is largely obeyed.

172
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,140
Although women have started to push the limits in larger cities, like Tehran, it's still

173
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,480
widely criticized and, in this case, punishable.

174
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,960
The woman was arrested for this display, which was widely shared on social media.

175
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,680
Another arrestable offense, this time in Thailand, is riding a bad online review—yes, you heard

176
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,740
that correctly.

177
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,560
An American living in the Southeast Asian country wasn't happy with being charged

178
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,140
a $15 dollar corkage fee at a beach resort in Koh Chang, so he did what any thumb-happy

179
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,720
traveler would do and wrote a negative TripAdvisor review.

180
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,280
The hotel was equally displeased and had him arrested on defamation charges, which are

181
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,620
notably harsh in a country that attempts to stifle some free speech.

182
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,500
He therefore spent a weekend in jail.

183
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,280
In more turbulent waters, construction started on what will soon be the world's largest

184
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,800
offshore wind farm.

185
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,780
When completed, the Dogger Wind Farm, in the North Sea off the eastern coast of the United

186
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:28,380
Kingdom, will provide enough energy to power 4.5 million homes every year, or 5% of England's

187
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,920
total energy demand.

188
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,260
The enormous energy production capability is made possible by their use of one of the

189
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:41,060
world's largest wind turbines, the Halyard X, which stands 853 feet or 260 meters tall

190
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,220
and has 351 foot or 107 meter blades.

191
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,540
Requiring much less power than that, though, is the Amis—a mini-car released in France

192
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:53,660
that can be driven without a license by anyone over 14.

193
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:57,540
Manufactured by Citroën, the all-electric Amis is what's officially dubbed a light

194
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,760
quadricycle.

195
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:03,420
The four-wheel cube can travel 28 miles per hour or 45 kilometers per hour with a range

196
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,900
of 46 miles or 75 kilometers, and it's got a mini price too, ringing in at just over

197
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,260
$7,000.

198
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,540
Another European product is making headlines, but this time, it's for the lack of it.

199
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,540
The world's second-largest producer of olive oil, Italy, has been plagued by bad

200
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,660
weather and a deadly bacteria, cutting production by more than a quarter this year.

201
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,360
The Xylella bacteria, also called leprosy, has hit the olive trees in the Puglia region

202
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,220
particularly hard, and those effects will be felt globally, especially in the United

203
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,280
States, which purchases one-third of Italy's oil.

204
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,980
At the southern end of the world, a 116-year-old man died in South Africa.

205
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,600
He was, however, the oldest man in the world at the time of his passing, at least unofficially,

206
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,140
having lived through the Spanish flu, which took the lives of his entire family.

207
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,020
He credited his long life to quote, God's grace, but it may have been health and strength

208
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,820
too—a couple weeks before he died of natural causes, his family said he was chopping wood

209
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,300
with a four-pound hammer.

210
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,100
Up the African coast, the two largest tanzanite gemstones ever unearthed were pulled out of

211
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,340
the only country in which they're found—Tanzania.

212
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,180
The two dark violet-blue minerals, each about 11 inches or 30 centimeters long and 4 inches

213
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:23,560
or 10 centimeters thick, rang in roughly $3.35 million for the mining boss who runs the 200-person

214
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,120
operation in the country's northern region.

215
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,500
He did what anybody who struck the motherlode would do—promise to build a school and shopping

216
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,140
mall, but first through a neighborhood party.

217
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:38,220
Multiple drug raids in the hills of Myanmar revealed a complex and burgeoning synthetic

218
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,580
drug market, that's speculated to be fueling global demand for opioids like methamphetamine

219
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,660
and fentanyl.

220
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,340
The seizures were the largest finds in Southeast Asian history, and represent a transition

221
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,900
away from China, which had previously been supplying many of the chemicals for synthetics,

222
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,020
but cracked down under worldwide pressure.

223
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,580
In Kenya, the score is one for the fig tree, zero for developers.

224
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,900
A four-story tree in the country's capital of Nairobi was set to be cut down to make

225
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,660
way for an expressway, but environmentalists put up a fight, and they won.

226
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,140
Not only will the tree be preserved in its spot, but it's now been elevated to legend

227
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:19,540
status, gaining notoriety both as an environmental symbol and as a call to action to protect

228
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:25,180
even more green space in a city that's constantly seeing parks and nature eliminated.

229
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,940
In grimmer news, the mayor of Seoul, the capital of South Korea, was found dead in a park this

230
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
summer.

231
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,240
A potential presidential candidate and the second most powerful person in the country,

232
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,260
so the passing sent unrest through the nation.

233
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,300
Several days before his death, a former secretary accused him of sexual harassment—especially

234
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,260
shocking since he was a champion of women's rights in a male-dominated country—so his

235
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,140
death is being treated as a suicide.

236
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,300
A less grim story comes from another mayor on the other side of the world in Bogota,

237
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Colombia, who recently became the first openly lesbian mayor ever for the capital city in

238
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,300
January.

239
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,600
This was a historic moment for the conservative Catholic country, and Latin America in general.

240
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,240
Claudia López married her partner in 2019, and is recognized for being a progressive

241
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,740
beacon in a region that's slow to progress LGBTQ rights.

242
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,500
Yachting in the Iberian Sea was a little more raucous than usual this fall, after a string

243
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,700
of orca incidents were reported in Spain, in which killer whales were targeting boat

244
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,300
rudders and causing damage to more than a dozen vessels.

245
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:32,480
The increasingly aggressive interactions initially puzzled researchers, but they now

246
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,540
believe the trio of orcas, which accounted for almost two-thirds of the two dozen reports,

247
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,920
were previously injured by a boat and perhaps reacting defensively to yachts because of

248
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,500
those traumatic incidents.

249
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,880
Another boating story brings us to Argentina, where a determined sailor finally docked on

250
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,580
land after completing an 85-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean.

251
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,820
The Portuguese resident set sail in mid-March after lockdown restrictions kept him from

252
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,280
travelling to sea his 90-year-old father.

253
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,020
He would not be deterred by the lack of flights, and decided to voyage by sea in his 29-foot

254
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,140
boat accompanied by rice, canned tuna, and fruit.

255
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,140
Uganda is home to 50% of the world's mountain gorillas, so when one of the country's most

256
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,300
famous, Rafiki, was killed by a poacher, the government took a harder stance than it had

257
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,300
previously.

258
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,020
Officials chose to jail the killer for six years.

259
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,180
This landmark ruling sends a message to future poachers that animal killings won't be tolerated,

260
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,920
and is a win for wildlife groups which have been calling for more restrictive measures

261
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,060
for many years.

262
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:41,380
In terms of on-brand news for 2020, wildfires coming within one mile of Chernobyl in Ukraine

263
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,540
has to be near the top of the list.

264
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,380
An 18-mile exclusion zone was set up after the nuclear disaster there in the 80s, and

265
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,060
this wildfire spread into that area, causing officials to worry that not only would radioactive

266
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,940
material be dispersed into the air, but that it might threaten existing structures and

267
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,480
a disposal site.

268
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,420
More than 300 firefighters were able to control the burn, preventing this lesser-known story

269
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,220
from becoming a major headline.

270
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,620
When a migrant rescue boat came across a backpack floating in the Mediterranean Sea, officials

271
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:16,120
had assumed its owners had perished in crossing from Algeria to Italy, as is often the case

272
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,660
with many found personal objects floating in this part of the world.

273
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,140
But this time, there was a happy ending.

274
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:26,620
An NGO in Italy was able to track down the owners of the personal items, who were migrants

275
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,540
that survived a shipwreck, and return the contents to them, which included their inscribed

276
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,140
wedding rings.

277
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,980
Sudan is taking baby steps towards democracy after three decades of oppressive laws that

278
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,160
were primarily targeted towards women.

279
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,700
Of highest priority is banning female genital mutilation—a typically religious practice

280
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,880
that affects almost 90% of Sudanese women.

281
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,280
The new transitional government is also loosening wardrobe restrictions for women and saying

282
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,020
okay to alcohol consumption, at least for non-Muslims, in the country.

283
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,480
The 3,600-year-old Gilgamesh Dream Tablet is being returned to its rightful home in

284
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,920
what is now Iraq, where it originated, after a curious and illegal journey that brought

285
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,260
it to the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, which was co-founded by none other than

286
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,520
tablet king and craft retail giant Hobby Lobby.

287
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,120
The rare cuneiform tablet features one of the oldest works of literature in the world,

288
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:23,240
the Epic of Gilgamesh, and was purchased by Hobby Lobby at auction for $1.6 million in

289
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,560
2014.

290
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:29,100
This isn't the first time Hobby Lobby has had problems with the provenance of its acquisitions,

291
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,880
as it previously had to forfeit 5,500 artifacts and pay a $3 million fine.

292
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,960
National identity cards in Afghanistan include a person's name, date of birth, and now,

293
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,460
both of their parents' names, which sounds pretty normal, but previously, just the father's

294
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,840
name was listed because using a women's in public was traditionally frowned upon and

295
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,960
even considered an insult—it's a restriction that goes so far that much of Afghanistan

296
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,000
does not list females' names on their gravestones.

297
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,740
This step in updating ID cards is seen as a small victory for women's rights in the

298
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,720
overwhelmingly conservative country.

299
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,920
When a herd of elephants at Poland's Warsaw Zoo became sad after losing their matriarch,

300
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,560
which lead a given herd, veterinarians turned to Colorado's favorite stress reliever—medical

301
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,960
marijuana.

302
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,480
The three African elephants are given doses of liquid cannabis through their trunks, and

303
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,940
researchers will study hormone levels in their blood over the next two years to monitor how

304
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,960
it affects their stress.

305
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,440
A small town of 7,000 people in Canada gave itself a new identity when they voted this

306
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,740
year to change the city's name from Asbestos to Val-de-Sauce, or Valley of the Springs.

307
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,520
The town got its name for being home to the largest asbestos mine in the world, but since

308
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,960
the mineral has been linked to causing cancer and the mine has shut, residents voted to

309
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,520
disassociate from the toxic substance.

310
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,300
But it wasn't without a fight.

311
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,000
More veteran members of the community were opposed to the name change as they felt it

312
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,800
was unnecessary, because in French, which is spoken there, the word for asbestos is

313
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,160
ambiente.

314
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,480
Tensions are simmering in a United Nations-backed buffer zone between Morocco and Mauritania,

315
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,440
which could bring a 29-year truce to a boiling point.

316
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,120
The Western Sahara contested zone has long been controlled by Morocco under a ceasefire

317
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,320
agreement with the Polisario Front—a pro-independence movement.

318
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,120
But now, the front has blocked transportation between the two countries, and Morocco has

319
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,520
launched a military operation in response.

320
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,120
On the same latitude, but a few time zones over, Saudi Arabia wants to maintain its claim

321
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,600
as the world's top energy exporter, but now with hydrogen.

322
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,640
Blue hydrogen is a carbon dioxide byproduct of reforming natural gas, and Saudi Arabia

323
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,660
sent its first cargo shipment of it to Japan this year, all in an effort to profit off

324
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,440
the world's transition to greener fuels.

325
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,320
Part of this goal also includes plans to build a $5 billion hydrogen-based ammonia plant

326
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,600
powered by renewable energy on the Red Sea.

327
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,040
Uzbekistan's language can be written in three ways—Arabic, Cyrillic, and Latin—but

328
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,640
it's the latter that will soon be the norm, thanks to a decree by the country's president

329
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,120
which called for a faster transition away from Cyrillic.

330
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,920
Though Uzbek was originally written in Arabic, Russian influence during the early 20th century

331
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,160
changed it to Cyrillic, and now, to distance itself from Russia, Uzbekistan wants to move

332
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,980
towards Latin script, consisting of 29 letters and one apostrophe, to help develop a stronger,

333
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,840
more unique national identity.

334
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,740
Peruvians are hoping that the third time's a charm after three presidents reigned in

335
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,280
just one week.

336
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,600
Francisco's Sagasti will now lead the country, following a Congress-led ousting of one president,

337
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,000
and a five-day term-turned-resignation by the second.

338
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,960
Sagasti is seen as a consensus builder, so citizens are hopeful, but the tumultuous leadership

339
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,280
changes over the past several years leave a lot of uncertainty and, frankly, apathy

340
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,320
at this point.

341
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,880
If there's a baby boom this spring, a shortage of condom manufacturing in March may be the

342
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
culprit.

343
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,360
A Malaysian company, Carex BHD, makes one in every five condoms globally, and when the

344
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:17,900
pandemic hit this year, facilities were forced to shut down, resulting in at least 100 million

345
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,000
fewer condoms worldwide.

346
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,720
It ramped back up quickly, but the effects of a shortage like this could be at least

347
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,360
nine months away.

348
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,240
It's been… a year for Africa's richest woman, Isabel Dos Santos.

349
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,520
She's the eldest daughter of Angola's former longtime leader, José Eduardo Dos

350
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,920
Santos, and in January was charged with embezzlement and laundering more than $1 billion from her

351
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,080
native country.

352
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,360
Then, in October, her husband died in, reportedly, a diving accident off the coast of Dubai.

353
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,760
She was an avid art collector and also tied up in the scandal she faced, meaning it's

354
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,000
a tragic tale with lots of plot twists that doesn't seem to have a final chapter yet.

355
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Another story about $1 billion revolves around the United Kingdom's investment in Mozambique.

356
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,760
This year, a deal was inked to send UK taxpayer-funded financial support to develop and export the

357
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,000
African country's gas reserves—one of the largest financing projects on the continent

358
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,960
ever, according to some reports—but its citizens and environmental groups are shouting

359
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,700
hypocrite as the UK continues to claim it's a global leader in the fight against climate

360
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,840
change.

361
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,080
Speaking of oil in Africa, a floating storage and offloading facility moored off the coast

362
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:34,400
of Yemen continues to deteriorate and threatens to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil

363
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,720
into the Red Sea, which would be four times the amount of the Exxon Valdez spill.

364
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,520
The war in Yemen has prevented the United Nations from doing anything to prevent a potential

365
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,360
leak, but recently Houthi rebels, which control the area where the vessel is stuck and the

366
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,320
oil company that owns it, gave permission for world leaders to move ahead with rehabilitation

367
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,040
plans.

368
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,040
The African country of Ghana may be a respite for Black Americans seeking refuge from the

369
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,720
United States' ongoing racial injustice, and Ghanaian officials are actually recruiting

370
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,960
members of the African diaspora.

371
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,880
The government set up a handful of enticements for transplants, including land yields, expatriate

372
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,160
guides, and quicker paths to citizenship, and all of this comes on the heels of a 45%

373
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,160
increase in visitor numbers from the United States last year.

374
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,520
Math, science, and reading are, of course, required subjects for children in school,

375
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,520
and now, in one country, downward dog is too.

376
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,520
In March, Nepal became the first nation in the world to incorporate yoga into its mandatory

377
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
curriculum.

378
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,080
Parents in the Himalayan country won't just practice the poses, but they'll learn about

379
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,840
the history of yogic thought and Ayurvedic medicine.

380
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:52,400
Children, or the idea of them at least, are making headlines in Venezuela, where controversial

381
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,140
Twitter-happy president Nicolas Maduro asks for every woman in the country to have six

382
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,300
children.

383
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,760
The plea was met with immediate backlash because the country is in a deep economic recession,

384
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,720
and is unable to provide essential services like food and healthcare for the millions

385
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,980
of residents it already has.

386
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:14,560
He apparently views more children as part of the solution, though he offered little

387
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,760
in the way of specifics as to how.

388
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,680
Ever heard of Voltsko's chameleon?

389
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,680
No?

390
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Well, that's okay, almost nobody has since the elusive reptile hadn't been seen in

391
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,720
almost 100 years and was actually placed on the extinction list.

392
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,840
But, this year, a team of researchers spotted it on the northwest tip of Madagascar.

393
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,760
There, the reptile is only thought to live during the rainy season, making it a mayfly

394
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
of vertebrae.

395
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,240
This, of course, makes it even more vulnerable to the deforestation that continues to threaten

396
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,400
their sheer existence, but its rediscovery gives scientists hope for other species which

397
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,720
were also thought to be extinct.

398
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:57,580
The unearthing of four 8,000-year-old skeletons in Cameroon is a groundbreaking find that's

399
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,100
providing new information about our current human species.

400
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,260
The DNA from these skeletons offers the first genetic material from West African humans,

401
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:11,420
painting a better picture of how ancient people split into four genetic groups, both physically

402
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,060
and geographically.

403
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,180
Of the four populations, it's been the West African genes that have remained elusive to

404
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,060
researchers until now.

405
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:25,420
Political unrest looms over the Ivory Coast as President Alassane Otaara won, controversially,

406
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,900
a third term in November.

407
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,380
When his planned successor suddenly died this summer, Otaara reneged on his pledge

408
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:38,660
to leave office, and even though he received 94% of the vote, many, including the opposition,

409
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,260
saw the process as unfair.

410
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:44,980
It's indicative of a wider trend in African politics, which has seen third-term bids and

411
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,100
constitutional amendments increasing in recent years.

412
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,320
More than 40% of North Korean men smoke, but a new law that bans puffing down in public

413
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,420
places might smolder that statistic.

414
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,820
Citing health reasons, tobacco is now prohibited in specific venues such as political and ideological

415
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,420
education centers, theaters, cinemas, and medical and public health facilities.

416
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,820
One person who might struggle with this new law?

417
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,100
Leader Kim Jong-un, who is a chain-smoker and frequently photographed with a cigarette

418
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,100
in hand.

419
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,500
But, the country is moving forward with the prohibition despite being unable to convince

420
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,660
its supreme leader to kick the habit.

421
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,860
Another big find was recently made by scientists—this time in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast

422
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:32,700
of Australia—where a pinnacle of coral one-third of a mile long was discovered by researchers.

423
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,300
While you might think that the world-famous natural wonder would be thoroughly mapped

424
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,060
out, this was actually the first major new element of the reef to be discovered in over

425
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,180
120 years.

426
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,540
Of course, the reef is shrinking by the year due to the effects of climate change and coral

427
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:53,180
bleaching, so even the discovery of this comparatively small section is great news.

428
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,220
Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, but its location also makes it a key regional

429
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:01,940
recipient of Western aid funding the fight against Islamic terrorism.

430
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:07,660
That's why an audit of its defense spending that revealed a loss of $137 million over

431
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,420
8 years raised more than eyebrows.

432
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,260
Apparently, the country was overcharged in several instances, sometimes by nearly $20

433
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,900
million, for important military equipment, and Western countries that grant Niger money

434
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,300
are questioning their decisions and potentially future giving.

435
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:27,740
You don't have to worry about the spread of airborne viruses in Sri Lanka's newest

436
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,740
museum because it's underwater.

437
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,380
Created by naval officers off the southern tip of the island nation, the country's

438
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,140
first ever below-water museum is a collection of artifacts and sculptures installed 50 feet

439
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,660
beneath the surface.

440
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,540
The attraction is not only intended to draw tourists, but it should lure fish and spur

441
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,580
coral growth too.

442
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,620
One of Burkina Faso's largest gold mines was shut down for almost a year after 39 employees

443
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,200
were killed in an attack on their convoy.

444
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,040
Since then, the Canadian-owned Bungu mine has restarted with tightened security measures

445
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,060
and improved infrastructure.

446
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:04,960
During the year hiatus, the mine's owners actually changed from one Canadian company

447
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,680
to another for $735 million, which is notable because, even though agriculture still accounts

448
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,340
for 80% of the country's economy, gold exports driven by foreign investments continue to

449
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,220
develop alternate economic sectors.

450
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,940
And on the subject of West African unrest, a military coup in Mali ousted the country's

451
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,500
president and prime minister in August, following eight years of disrupted elections, government

452
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,420
corruptions, and Islamic insurgency.

453
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:33,100
Military colonels remain in power today.

454
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,300
This further instability could send ripple effects across the region because of Mali's

455
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,420
strategic location for Western countries such as France and the United States, which have

456
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,420
actively tried to prevent increased tensions in the area.

457
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:50,700
File this story under Stranger Than Fiction because, well, it's about non-fiction.

458
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,960
Some 200 books, including first editions by Galileo and Sir Isaac Newton, were found buried

459
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,860
underneath a rural Romanian cottage, after a three-year search that spanned 45 addresses

460
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,500
in three countries.

461
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,740
The $3.35 million worth of books were stolen during a heist from a London warehouse in

462
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,660
2017.

463
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,100
Wanting to get away from it all?

464
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:17,420
For a cool $20 million, you can buy a 50,000-acre island off the coast of Chile.

465
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:22,540
Acquiring private islands is nothing new, but this one is making headlines because environmentalists

466
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,980
and the indigenous population are not happy that this biodiversity hotspot has a price

467
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,600
tag at all.

468
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,280
Even though the island has been in private hands for a century, they're worried that

469
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,180
new ownership could jeopardize its future conservation and sets a dangerous precedent.

470
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,820
In an effort to bolster its economy, Malawi became the fifth African country to decriminalize

471
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,620
medical marijuana.

472
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,740
Almost 80% of the country's population is employed in agriculture, and it used to be

473
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:53,760
a major producer of tobacco, but, as global demand for tobacco declines, it's looking

474
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,780
for alternate revenue streams.

475
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,460
Enter Malawi gold, an already popular strain of recreational cannabis.

476
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:05,140
The country's dry climate is actually conducive to growing marijuana, and as the herb's

477
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,740
popularity increases around the world, Malawians plan to jump on the ganja train.

478
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:15,700
Kazakhstan is known for a few things—its oil and gas economy, its proximity to Russia

479
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,220
and Mongolia, and just generally for being a stan—but in Western culture, it's perhaps

480
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:24,900
most famous for one of its fictional natives, Borat Sagdiev.

481
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:29,640
Played by actor Sacha Baron Cohen, the satirical character Borat pokes fun at Kazakhstan with

482
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,140
the catchphrase, very nice, but officials there realize those words have standing power,

483
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,440
and recently officially adopted them as their official tourism slogan.

484
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,780
The African Ansel mole rat, native to Zambia, is near-blind, burrows underground, and this

485
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:48,420
year, scientists discovered it can sense magnetic fields with its eyes.

486
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:52,900
Though the animal's eyes are barely functional, discerning between just light and dark, this

487
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,340
new discovery gives more clues as to how the creature travels and lives in an underground

488
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:02,860
network up to 1.7 miles or 2.7 kilometers long, and of course, it may help humans in

489
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:08,180
our own scientific advances, as we learn more about nature, and as we often do, try

490
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,780
to mimic it.

491
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:14,540
Government officials in Guatemala passed a $12.2 billion budget that raised stipends

492
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:18,460
for representatives' meals, while cutting funding for human rights agencies, health

493
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:22,860
care, and education, triggering residents to protest in the streets and set the congressional

494
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,700
building on fire.

495
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,980
Their anger at the misplaced spending comes on the heels of not only the pandemic, but

496
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,780
two destructive hurricanes that tore through the country this fall.

497
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,360
It turns out, tragedy after tragedy is when people need help the most.

498
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,980
In July, Ecuador reported that more than 300 Chinese fishing vessels were encroaching on

499
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,260
its exclusive fishing zones near the Galapagos, with the illegal fishing fleets going as far

500
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,540
as to turn off their tracking devices to remain undetected.

501
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,500
So, the South American country joined coastal neighbors Chile, Peru, and Colombia to file

502
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:59,400
a joint statement—or rather, a light threat—about protecting their waters from the increasing

503
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,120
creep of foreign fishing and, ultimately, China's expanding presence.

504
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,320
Overseas, some new research into the life of the Netherlands' most famous artist,

505
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,640
Vincent van Gogh, reveals that he didn't suffer from schizophrenia or syphilis, as

506
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,960
some have theorized, but rather that the delirium leading up to his death may be attributed

507
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,740
to alcohol withdrawal.

508
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,840
The artist was institutionalized twice—once after cutting off his ear—and reported hallucinations

509
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,660
both times.

510
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:29,280
Researchers now believe these symptoms were due to his lack of wine and absinthe, which

511
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,860
he consumed in great amounts during the most prolific, and final, years of his life.

512
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:41,180
In somber news, Syria topped an unenviable list in 2019, being named the deadliest place

513
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,700
in the world for humanitarian workers.

514
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:48,240
The report on the subject, released this year, details that the number of people killed helping

515
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,940
the war-torn country rose sharply last year, with the majority of deaths stemming from

516
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,500
aerial strikes.

517
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,020
Officials say the grim statistic will make it harder to recruit aid workers to a place

518
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,460
where they're needed the most.

519
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,140
One rodent that's turning its species' reputation around is Magawa, a landmine-sniffing

520
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,060
rat in Cambodia.

521
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:13,100
The five-year-old African pouched rat has discovered 39 landmines, 28 pieces of unexploded

522
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,540
ordnance, and helped clear more than 1.5 million square feet of land over the past four years,

523
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,980
rightfully earning itself the gold medal from the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals.

524
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,060
That, unsurprisingly, makes it the first rat to receive an award that is usually reserved

525
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,780
for humans.

526
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,380
After the tragic port explosion in Beirut, Senegal moved quickly to avoid a similar catastrophe

527
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,000
and removed 3,050 tons of ammonium nitrate from its port.

528
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,260
The substance was transported to Mali, where it was used to make bombs for mining operations.

529
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:49,960
Ammonium nitrate is commonly found in fertilizers and explosives, so ports around the world

530
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,600
which temporarily house the volatile compound, such as Senegal's Dakar, made sure they

531
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:58,560
weren't in the same vulnerable situation as Beirut, where the substance led to the

532
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,200
accidental explosion that killed 190 people.

533
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,960
South African extrative economies continue to make headlines, such as Chad, which recently

534
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,360
asked UNESCO to postpone the process for designating Lake Chad as a World Heritage Site.

535
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
Why?

536
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,760
Because Chad wants to explore oil and gas development in the lake area, which directly

537
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,920
opposes UNESCO's conservation goals for World Heritage Sites.

538
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,320
It also came as a surprise to Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria, which cooperated on the two-year

539
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,800
application process for the multinational lake to gain this distinctive designation.

540
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,000
More fish theft brings us to the coast of Somalia, which stretches 2,000 miles or 3,200

541
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,480
kilometers and is the longest coastline in Africa.

542
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,520
That expanse makes it harder for the country to police its waters, where poachers like

543
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:51,760
a 192-vessel fleet from Iran are illegally fishing in the country's exclusive economic

544
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,860
zone.

545
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,960
The size of the Iranian operation, discovered this year, is a blow to Somalia, where one

546
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,980
in three residents face hunger, and it demonstrates the rising tensions over the planet's limited

547
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,360
natural resources.

548
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,880
One resource being exported out of Africa that benefits from increased demand is a Zimbabwean

549
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,900
film that became the country's first feature to make it to Netflix.

550
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,340
The movie, Cook-Off, is about a woman who enters a TV cooking show, and it was made

551
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:24,360
for just $8,000—an impressive feat given that it was produced in 2017, just before

552
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,660
the country's economy collapsed.

553
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:31,220
This acquisition by the streaming giant gives more credibility to Zimbabwe's film industry,

554
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:36,040
and means that the production crew and actors may finally get paid.

555
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,300
A small band of chimpanzees in Guinea that are known for their remarkable use of tools

556
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,940
were thought to be near extinction, until the tribe's last fertile female gave birth

557
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,220
to a beacon of hope—another female.

558
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:53,420
Deforestation and isolation led to the tribe's demise, and this group is of particular interest

559
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,100
to researchers because they mimic humans' use of tools.

560
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:00,980
But this bundle of joy has also created momentum for the country's residents to increase

561
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:06,540
protections and forestation to ensure there is a future for the chimpanzees.

562
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:10,500
One of the world's most wanted fugitives was found this year in a small apartment on

563
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,180
the outskirts of Paris.

564
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,660
Felicia Cabuga was arrested for his role in the Rwandan genocide, which killed 800,000

565
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,340
members of the Tutsi ethnic minority, among others, in 1994.

566
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,320
Cabuga will be tried in a UN tribunal court next year, and this capture renews efforts

567
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:33,300
to find others on the run who played significant roles in the country's darkest days.

568
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:38,100
France and Benin also made news in 2020, with the former's government fast-tracking a

569
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,760
bill aimed at returning looted objects to the sub-Saharan country within a year.

570
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,620
The move is part of a multi-year restitution effort between European countries and their

571
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:51,160
former colonies, and this law specifically returns 26 royal artifacts that were stolen

572
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,340
from the Abomi Palace during the 19th century.

573
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,980
These cultural repatriation efforts are ongoing, signaling an African drive to reclaim its

574
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,580
cultural identity after centuries of European pillaging.

575
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,800
Efforts to protect sea turtles in Tunisia are working, says new scientific research

576
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:14,180
that shows nests on Kiryat Island have increased from 11 to more than 40 since 1997.

577
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,260
Turtles are a keystone species, meaning their disappearance would disproportionately damage

578
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:23,480
ecosystems, and their increased presence in this area, despite threats from people, climate,

579
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:28,920
and pollution, is good news for the reptiles and the workers striving to save them.

580
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,800
Two Chinese bidders, with the pseudonyms Super Duper and Hitman, bought a Belgian racing

581
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,400
pigeon for a record price of $1.9 million.

582
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,180
Belgium is the world's leading racing pigeon-breeding country and, thanks to a booming economy,

583
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:50,160
the Chinese upper class have a lot of money to spend even compared to a decade ago, so

584
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,660
why not invest in something like a pigeon?

585
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,120
The bird will likely be bred with another genetically superior pigeon to create a superbird

586
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,520
that will dominate in racing circles, and betting on those is just one area where the

587
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,040
Chinese are spending significant amounts of their yuan.

588
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,520
11 months in Argentina sounds nice, but for Bolivian president Evo Morales, it was more

589
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,680
of an exile.

590
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,200
He reentered Bolivia this November, after a 2019 campaign for a fourth presidential

591
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,600
term became marred by fraud allegations, leading him to flee the country.

592
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,280
A caretaker government has managed affairs since then, but when Morales' former economic

593
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,560
minister recently assumed leadership, it paved the way for Morales to return, though

594
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:33,240
it's unclear what role he'll play in the country's new reality.

595
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,520
If it all sounds turbulent, it is.

596
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,640
Latin American countries continue to struggle with government instability, and this is just

597
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,440
one more on the list.

598
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,200
The financial situation in Cuba worsened this year, when the United States placed increased

599
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,520
restrictions on the country, forcing the closure of 400 Western Union offices, and potentially

600
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,560
cutting off a stream of remittances from abroad.

601
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,280
The United States claims the move came in response to the Cuban government purportedly

602
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,120
siphoning a cut of the incoming money, but officials there say the move was politically

603
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,120
motivated.

604
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:09,680
Cuban-American relations have become more tenuous under Trump, but the new Biden administration

605
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,760
is expected to reinstate diplomatic relations, especially since Cuban refugee Alejandro Mayorkas

606
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,160
has been nominated to lead the Department of Homeland Security.

607
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,520
Popping one island over, Haiti's local president of FIFA, the governing body for

608
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,160
soccer, has been shut out and not in the winning way.

609
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,520
Haitian football president Yves Jean-Barre was issued a lifetime ban from all football-related

610
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,720
activities after he was found guilty of sexually harassing and abusing female players, including

611
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:36,720
minors.

612
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,540
He was also fined roughly $1.1 million.

613
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,080
Many are lauding the punishment, saying abuse should be rooted out of any industry at any

614
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,400
level.

615
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:51,000
South Sudan is the world's youngest country, formed in 2011.

616
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,780
Since then, it's experienced almost a decade of civil war, but earlier this year, feuding

617
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,940
parties finally signed a unity agreement.

618
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,920
Millions of people continue to flee the country and suffer from extreme hunger, but the establishment

619
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:08,440
of a ruling party offers one step in the right direction toward stability.

620
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,020
President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 55.

621
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,320
He leaves behind a legacy as an autocratic ruler known for committing a variety of human

622
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,980
rights abuses, and his death in June came just weeks after the country had already elected

623
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,960
a successor, which only happened because Nkurunziza did not seek re-election.

624
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,140
His death will have impacts on regional and global relations, potentially allowing for

625
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,660
increased unity under new leadership.

626
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,060
Despite the pandemic, the Dominican Republic has hosted more than two dozen feature film

627
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:44,980
and TV production shoots this year, which poured $80 million into the local economy,

628
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,100
smashing a previous annual record of $30 million in 2017.

629
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,840
Producers track their local expenditures because part of the country's international incentive

630
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:58,180
for filming there is a 25% rebate through a transferable tax credit.

631
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:02,340
That's attractive to American filmmakers, like M. Night Shyamalan, who took advantage

632
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:07,040
of it this year, because they can spend 25% of wages in the Dominican Republic and maintain

633
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,480
tax incentive status in the United States.

634
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,160
A deer stealing their rifle isn't something that hunters would think they'd have to

635
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,560
worry about when out stalking, but that's what happened to one in the Czech Republic

636
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,800
when his dog startled the deer, which ran toward him and looped his rifle with an antler.

637
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,200
The deer was seen a mile away, with the gun still in tow.

638
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,920
Reportedly, it wasn't loaded, but had it been, a deer claiming self-defense might have

639
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,920
worked in this case.

640
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,440
Still filed under bizarre sightings is a tiny child floating on an inflatable unicorn in

641
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,040
the Mediterranean Sea.

642
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,280
The three-year-old girl was swept into the water while playing on a beach in Greece,

643
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,220
but rescued shortly after by a passing ferryboat.

644
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,240
She was delivered back to her family safely, and yes, the unicorn made it too.

645
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,780
When Brazilian Maya Guevara surfed a 73.5 foot or 22.4 meter wave off the coast of Portugal

646
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:02,480
in February, she didn't just ride the biggest wave ever for a woman, it was the largest

647
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,580
wave surfed by anyone, period, during the 2019-2020 season.

648
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:12,000
She is the first woman in professional surfing to top all men in terms of wave size in a

649
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,920
season, but with another female surfer earning spot number two on the big wave list this

650
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,440
year, it's clear she may not hold the title for long.

651
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,600
The title for the highest smoking rate in the world goes to Jordan, where a shocking

652
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,020
80% of the male population says they use smoke or use nicotine products daily.

653
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:35,060
This was a status previously held by Indonesia, and bucked the global trend of declining tobacco

654
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,060
use.

655
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:39,820
Multinational tobacco companies are still allowed to hold a large amount of influence

656
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,780
in Jordan, from funding school programs to being featured on the Prime Minister's social

657
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:49,140
media, and this widespread interference is likely what's increasing use.

658
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:54,660
Rapper Cardi B may have overstepped her political boundaries when she posted an advertisement

659
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,080
supporting Armenia to her 76 million Instagram followers.

660
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,960
Unlike all wars, the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia has been a tragic one that ended

661
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,180
with Armenia's defeat in a pact between the two countries over the disputed territory

662
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:11,920
of Nagorno-Karabakhsh, which will remain with Azerbaijan.

663
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,200
But Cardi B was only trying to help a real estate agent friend when she made the post,

664
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,520
and has since apologized amid the backlash.

665
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,180
Unstaffed grocery stores accessed by logging in with BankID, the national identification

666
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:28,460
app operated by Sweden's banks, seems like something only Sweden could pull off in remote

667
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,260
areas, which is why they're probably the ones doing it.

668
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,000
Amid a drastic decline in food markets across the country, mostly in rural areas, the company

669
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,660
Livs has installed almost 20 small container stores that are fully stocked with meat, vegetables,

670
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,340
dairy, and desserts.

671
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:49,660
Customers simply swipe an app to enter and pay for groceries, no store clerk needed.

672
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:53,020
Israeli flights traveling to and from the United Arab Emirates can now cross through

673
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,300
Saudi Arabian airspace, marking the first time that commercial jets on this route can

674
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,420
pass over the Kingdom's territory.

675
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,700
The announcement cuts travel time between the two countries in half, to three and a

676
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:08,460
half hours, and signals normalizing relations, both diplomatically and economically.

677
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:13,220
According to reports, the decision to open the airspace came at the request of the UAE.

678
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,860
It became the third Arab country to acknowledge relations with Israel, behind Egypt and Jordan,

679
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,020
and the development signals some progress in an otherwise unstable region, though Saudi

680
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,420
Arabia was quick to note that opening airspace didn't change the country's stance on

681
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,140
the Israel-Palestine issue.

682
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:35,380
Despite having previously faced murder charges, Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, aka the Tiger,

683
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,380
was still named police chief in 2012 in Honduras.

684
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:42,900
So, it may not come as a surprise that he didn't uphold the tenets of the job, and

685
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,820
is now charged with conspiring to smuggle cocaine into the United States, but the plot

686
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:48,820
thickens.

687
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,900
He wasn't smuggling cocaine for just anyone, but doing the dirty work for the Honduran

688
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:56,580
president and his brother, the latter of which was convicted for drug trafficking in

689
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:58,900
New York last year.

690
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:05,460
In Hungary, a scientist accidentally created a new fish hybrid in a lab dubbed the sturtlefish.

691
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,180
The combination of Russian sturgeon, whose eggs make premium caviar, and American paddlefish,

692
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:14,460
a filter feeder found in less than half of the United States, is an unlikely one that

693
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,340
would probably never have occurred without human intervention, based on geography alone.

694
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,740
And while there's no real practical purpose to the awkward-looking creature, it does demonstrate

695
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,460
that species' genetics are sometimes more similar than previously thought.

696
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:34,660
Also in the neighborhood is the proposed Baltic Black Sea Waterway—a 12,040-mile, 2,000-kilometer

697
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:38,780
inland shipping route that would cut through Poland, Ukraine, and some of the most ecologically

698
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,340
rich parts of Belarus.

699
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:44,500
Oh, and it would involve dredging up land inside the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, which

700
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,340
could potentially expose millions of people to latent nuclear waste.

701
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,140
Proponents say it would spur an economic boom for the region, while opponents argue

702
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:55,140
it will destroy the quote, Amazon of Europe.

703
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,140
It may end up happening piecemeal, with Ukraine and Belarus committing, and already starting

704
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,540
in some cases, to dredging up parts of their tributary rivers.

705
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:07,920
Tajikistan is one of the poorest countries in East Asia, and many residents cross into

706
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,320
Russia for higher-paying jobs and higher education.

707
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,300
The Russian-speaking population in this country has dwindled tenfold in four decades, but

708
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:20,180
there's new interest in teaching children their neighbor's language, marked by officials'

709
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,100
announcement that they would build five more Russian-speaking schools, with a capacity

710
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:28,680
for 1,200 students in each, in addition to the ten that have been constructed in just

711
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,860
the past two years.

712
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:36,300
A musician in Austria is pulling a different sort of string—that of Wolfgang Amadeus

713
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,060
Mozart's 250-year-old violin.

714
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:42,940
The musician took a leap when he asked the foundation that owns the violin if he could

715
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,800
borrow it to play and record the violin concertos on the exact instrument Mozart composed them

716
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,140
on between 1773 and 1775.

717
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:56,700
The answer was yes, and he performed them in October to small, live audiences.

718
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:01,020
A group of United Nations officials signed a letter to four countries protesting the

719
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,300
development of a massive mine in Papua New Guinea, citing grave concerns both for the

720
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,700
environment and human rights.

721
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,780
If built, the mine would be the largest in the nation's history, and potentially produce

722
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:16,740
$1.5 billion of gold, copper, and silver annually for 30 years.

723
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,860
But that money would mostly go to Chinese investors in the Australian Registered Mining

724
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,820
Company, and the real costs would come in the form of catastrophic economic disaster

725
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,300
on the Sepik River, where it would be located.

726
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:33,440
More than 43 million tweets amplifying positive news coverage of Serbian President Aleksandr

727
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,500
Vucic were linked to his Serbian Progressive Party, and Twitter subsequently blocked 8,500

728
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,360
accounts for attempts to undermine public conversation.

729
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:45,740
The tweets were making his governing look better than it actually was, and this isn't

730
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,220
just happening in Serbia.

731
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:51,880
The tech company blocked some additional 13,000 accounts in countries like Egypt, Honduras,

732
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,960
and Saudi Arabia for doing the same thing.

733
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,840
Serbia is the 98th largest country in the world, meaning we're halfway to 195.

734
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:06,160
Therefore, that's where we'll end part one, and part two will be going up December

735
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,160
31st.

736
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:11,340
While you wait for that, though, I have something else, new and rather exciting, for you to

737
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,340
watch.

738
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,600
Tomorrow, on Nebula, we release the first episode of Sam from Wendover Presents, a very

739
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,700
good trivia show presented by Sam from Wendover.

740
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,460
You see, we were going to film something for our last Nebula Original of the year on location,

741
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,860
like we normally do, but then, you know, everything got in the way.

742
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,060
Can't break our C-word rule now.

743
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:35,440
Therefore, we decided to do something completely different—a trivia show, filmed remotely,

744
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,140
with three fantastic contestants—Brian from Real Engineering, Dave from City Beautiful,

745
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:41,140
and Jordan Harrod.

746
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,360
They competed in seven games, some of which were pretty normal, and others of which were

747
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,120
pretty out there.

748
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:51,480
This was all hosted by me, and I even go on camera, so get mentally prepared for that.

749
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,900
Of course, the only place to watch this is on Nebula, as their business model makes bigger

750
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,940
projects like this financially possible, and there's quite literally never been a better

751
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,140
time to sign up.

752
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:06,900
That's because our sponsor, CuriosityStream, is having its biggest ever sale—41% off,

753
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:12,000
meaning it works out to less than $1 a month, and by signing up at CuriosityStream.com

754
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,700
slash Wendover, any subscription is bundled with a Nebula subscription for the exact same

755
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,700
price.

756
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,320
That's two whole streaming sites, with thousands of top-quality documentaries and non-fiction

757
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:27,000
shows from bigger names, in the case of CuriosityStream, and tons of bigger-budget projects from your

758
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,060
favorite educational-ish creators, in the case of Nebula, for less than the cost of

759
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,060
a bus fare per month.

760
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,660
While you wait for our original to come out, you could, for example, watch something quite

761
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,920
similar to this video—it's where CuriosityStream rounds up the top science stories of 2020

762
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,280
in an hour-long special, which is quite good.

763
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,540
This sale will end very soon, so make sure to sign up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover,

764
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,580
and you'll be supporting this and countless other independent channels while you're

765
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:53,600
at it.
