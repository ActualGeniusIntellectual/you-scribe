00:10.260 --> 00:15.640
No sports league in the world makes more money than the American National Football League.

00:15.640 --> 00:20.020
The NFL earns more yearly revenue than the English Premier League, the Champions League,

00:20.020 --> 00:24.000
Formula One, the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball League, and the Continental Hockey

00:24.000 --> 00:25.640
League combined.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.160
It is by far the largest sports league in the world by revenue.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.040
Making up the NFL are 32 football teams each themselves essentially acting as their own

00:35.040 --> 00:36.720
distinct businesses.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.320
These teams are spread out all across the contiguous United States, some only 30 miles

00:41.320 --> 00:47.520
or 45 kilometers apart from each other, some nearly 3,000 miles or 4,500 kilometers apart.

00:47.520 --> 00:52.600
Now, American football teams are some of the largest in sports, both physically and in

00:52.600 --> 00:53.600
numbers.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.240
They have a roster of 56 players, the majority of which play in any given game.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.000
These players weigh on average about 250 pounds or 110 kilograms.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.600
This team size leads to some particular travel needs.

01:06.600 --> 01:10.440
Players each require a first class seat or, at the very least, the seat next to them free

01:10.440 --> 01:15.760
in economy meaning those 56 players take up far more than 56 seats.

01:15.760 --> 01:20.360
On top of that, a team typically brings more than 100 support staff and an immense amount

01:20.360 --> 01:22.960
of cargo to each away game.

01:22.960 --> 01:27.400
With the exception of the largest, most valuable ones, most other professional sports teams

01:27.400 --> 01:34.640
in the US will just fly on chartered narrow-body aircraft like A320s, 737s, or 757s, but most

01:34.640 --> 01:39.200
NFL teams, given their size, require something larger.

01:39.200 --> 01:44.200
NFL teams tend to charter their aircraft from commercial airlines—American, Delta, United,

01:44.200 --> 01:48.200
or Hawaiian airlines—and they'll typically fly something a bit larger than other teams

01:48.200 --> 01:53.480
like a 767 or sometimes even a 777, but the nature of this charter job makes finding a

01:53.480 --> 01:56.320
plane to take them particularly difficult.

01:56.320 --> 02:00.640
You see, let's take the example of the New York Jets' last game of the 2018 season

02:00.640 --> 02:03.920
versus the New England Patriots on December 30th.

02:03.920 --> 02:10.280
For this game, they left the day before on a United Airlines 767-400 at 3.37 pm, landing

02:10.280 --> 02:14.560
30 minutes later at 4.07 pm in Providence, Rhode Island.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.640
The plane then sat on the ground at Providence Airport for the next 26 hours until the game

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
was over.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.700
The following day, the plane took off at 6.30 pm bound for New York.

02:24.700 --> 02:28.000
The aircraft's previous flight had been to Buenos Aires and its next flight was to

02:28.000 --> 02:33.240
London and yet for these 26 hours, United only made money from the half-hour charter

02:33.240 --> 02:35.320
flight to and from Providence.

02:35.320 --> 02:39.720
It's easy to understand why this wouldn't really be worth it to the airline, but at

02:39.720 --> 02:44.140
least the jets are located next to a United Airlines hub at Newark Airport.

02:44.140 --> 02:48.680
Many teams, like the New Orleans Saints, for example, are not located in a city with any

02:48.680 --> 02:49.820
airline hub.

02:49.820 --> 02:53.820
That makes finding an airline to take their charter contract even more difficult.

02:53.820 --> 02:58.340
That's because, for example, when the team had to travel to Charlotte last season, the

02:58.340 --> 03:03.060
767 that took them had to fly in empty from Houston, the nearest United hub, then fly

03:03.060 --> 03:08.100
to Charlotte, sit on the ground for 33 hours, fly back to New Orleans, then once again fly

03:08.100 --> 03:10.980
empty—this time all the way to New York.

03:10.980 --> 03:15.520
All told, for those 2 hours and 51 minutes of flight time United was paid for, they used

03:15.520 --> 03:18.960
this airplane for almost 44 hours.

03:18.960 --> 03:23.180
Being located away from an airline hub, where planes are based, means charter flights will

03:23.180 --> 03:27.000
almost always require a plane flying in empty.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.340
It is for this reason that airlines are raising rates or just flat out stopping flying NFL

03:31.340 --> 03:36.200
teams as they find normal commercial flying a more lucrative use of their aircraft.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.520
American Airlines, in recent years, for example, dropped all the many teams they previously

03:40.560 --> 03:45.480
flew except for the Carolina Panthers, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Philadelphia Eagles—three

03:45.480 --> 03:47.960
teams located at their hub airports.

03:47.960 --> 03:52.260
More teams have moved their contract to dedicated charter companies such as Atlas Air or Miami

03:52.260 --> 03:57.160
Air International while the New England Patriots even bought their own set of planes to solve

03:57.160 --> 03:58.500
this issue.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.840
Some other teams still have contracts with commercial airlines but have switched to flying

04:01.840 --> 04:05.360
multiple smaller planes as these can be in less demand.

04:05.360 --> 04:10.320
The Indianapolis Colts, for example, now typically travel in two Delta 757s leaving

04:10.320 --> 04:12.560
within a half hour of each other.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.780
Other American sports, such as hockey, baseball, and basketball, don't have nearly as much

04:16.780 --> 04:21.320
of a problem because they play far more games a season which makes their contract a more

04:21.320 --> 04:26.120
attractive one to airlines and they also typically use smaller aircraft of which there are more

04:26.120 --> 04:27.280
available.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.200
The NFL briefly considered investing in its own fleet of aircraft or at least negotiating

04:31.200 --> 04:36.140
a deal with an airline in bulk like the NBA does with Delta, but for now, NFL teams are

04:36.140 --> 04:41.140
seeing their travel costs skyrocket as the laws of supply and demand take hold.

04:41.140 --> 04:44.880
After losing their contract with American Airlines, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars

04:44.880 --> 04:50.680
saw their travel costs double to $4 million a year as they chartered an Atlas Air 747

04:50.680 --> 04:56.440
and remember, those $4 million pay for the travel costs to a mere eight away games.

04:56.440 --> 05:00.840
But the NFL's most daunting logistics problem is not this.

05:00.840 --> 05:06.440
Their most daunting logistics problem relates to the NFL's other big problem—expansion.

05:06.440 --> 05:11.040
You see, part of the reason the NFL is the most valuable sports league in the world is

05:11.040 --> 05:17.840
because of how saturated the football market is in the US—57% of Americans identify as

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
NFL fans.

05:18.840 --> 05:24.080
That's an amazing level of market saturation for what is, at its core, a business, but

05:24.080 --> 05:28.800
that also presents a problem because, with such a high proportion of the population already

05:28.800 --> 05:33.800
stands, it's quite difficult for the NFL to expand their audience—at least within

05:33.800 --> 05:34.800
the US.

05:34.800 --> 05:39.380
In the past decade or so, the league has turned its attention internationally.

05:39.380 --> 05:44.280
The NFL now plays regular season games in Mexico City and London.

05:44.280 --> 05:48.720
These cities don't have home teams, but rather, two teams from the US will come out

05:48.720 --> 05:49.720
and play.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.540
For the most part, these international games are about promoting the sport in these two

05:53.540 --> 05:57.480
countries which already have significant fan bases watching the sport on TV.

05:57.480 --> 06:01.720
There's never been more than one game a season in Mexico City, but in London, in the

06:01.720 --> 06:06.320
2019 season, they're playing four regular season games.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.980
With the 16 regular season games per team per year, any other city that has a resident

06:10.980 --> 06:16.480
NFL team typically only has eight home games, meaning London's quantity is really not

06:16.480 --> 06:17.680
that far off.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.720
What's more, the Jacksonville Jaguars are designated as a sort of home team for London

06:22.720 --> 06:26.600
and therefore play at least one of their games there each year in an attempt to give the

06:26.600 --> 06:29.200
city and country a clear team to root for.

06:29.200 --> 06:33.320
The league has even said that it plans to eventually have a full eight games per season

06:33.320 --> 06:37.000
in London—the same as any home city in the US.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.440
The reason there are now so many NFL games in London is because the sport of American

06:41.440 --> 06:45.600
football has gained significant inroads in the UK audience.

06:45.600 --> 06:51.240
The NFL estimates that it has 13 million fans in the UK, 4 million of which watch regularly,

06:51.240 --> 06:56.040
and 47,000 of which buy games to every single NFL game in the UK.

06:56.040 --> 07:02.000
Its dedication to the UK has become so significant that it contributed $12.5 million to the construction

07:02.000 --> 07:05.040
of the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in North London.

07:05.040 --> 07:09.800
This recently opened stadium was built to become the home of the NFL in the UK.

07:09.800 --> 07:14.480
It has a permanent synthetic American football pitch under its grass soccer field, purpose-built

07:14.480 --> 07:19.480
NFL-sized locker rooms, and a media suite built to the preferences of NFL press.

07:19.480 --> 07:24.640
In the coming years, at least two NFL games will occur each year at this stadium.

07:24.640 --> 07:29.620
Now, the logistics of these international games in London are formidable.

07:29.620 --> 07:35.280
When the Seahawks played in London in 2018, they had to ship 1,150 rolls of athletic tape,

07:35.280 --> 07:42.440
about 4,000 pounds or 1,800 kilograms of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 shoes, 240

07:42.440 --> 07:47.000
pairs of socks, and tens of thousands of other pounds of equipment to the city weeks ahead

07:47.000 --> 07:48.240
of their arrival.

07:48.240 --> 07:52.280
Months before, they had to arrange for many of their players, who had never left the US,

07:52.280 --> 07:53.680
to get passports.

07:53.720 --> 07:56.800
The team's trainers had to carefully schedule their players' sleep in the week leading

07:56.800 --> 07:58.320
up to reduce jet lag.

07:58.320 --> 08:03.000
There's even a hotel in Watford with a purpose-built American football practice pitch that teams

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
typically stay in.

08:04.000 --> 08:09.080
While these London matches come at great difficulty and force teams to sacrifice a coveted home

08:09.080 --> 08:13.840
game, the teams and their owners seem to tolerate them given their infrequency and the promise

08:13.840 --> 08:15.000
of the UK market.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.840
But the promise of the UK market could push the NFL to stretch beyond eight international

08:19.840 --> 08:21.480
series games a year there.

08:21.480 --> 08:26.600
You see, there is some very real, very serious discussion of putting a National Football

08:26.600 --> 08:28.640
League team in London.

08:28.640 --> 08:33.280
There is little doubt that the city and country could support a team in terms of fan base.

08:33.280 --> 08:38.040
The issue, according to the league's commissioner, would be having one solitary team stationed

08:38.040 --> 08:42.500
more than 3,000 miles or 5,000 kilometers away from the next.

08:42.500 --> 08:47.260
It would be an immense logistics problem considering that, for the weekly games, teams would have

08:47.260 --> 08:52.020
to take flights as long as 11 hours crossing up to eight time zones.

08:52.020 --> 08:56.260
On the flip side, this London NFL team would have to travel continuously throughout the

08:56.260 --> 09:00.580
US for weeks at a time since, practically, it wouldn't make sense for them to return

09:00.580 --> 09:02.880
to London between the weekly games.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.700
This would come at enormous expense, would likely impact their performance, and prove

09:06.700 --> 09:08.940
unpopular with their players.

09:08.940 --> 09:14.060
In addition, as the UK does not yet have significant American football talent, the majority of

09:14.060 --> 09:17.880
this team's players would come from the US and would need to be persuaded, either

09:17.880 --> 09:21.940
monetarily or otherwise, to live outside their home country.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.500
Those are just some of the cost problems.

09:24.500 --> 09:30.060
Beyond that, it is not cheap to fly a whole NFL team over the Atlantic every week.

09:30.060 --> 09:34.960
For the international series games, teams were flown on chartered Virgin Atlantic 747

09:34.960 --> 09:40.000
or E330s arranged by the league, but if London had a fully fledged NFL team, it would likely

09:40.000 --> 09:44.540
be treated just like any other team meaning both them and their American competitors would

09:44.540 --> 09:46.800
have to arrange their own flights.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.640
The wide-body planes teams would have to charter to cross the Atlantic come at a cost of up

09:50.640 --> 09:53.240
to $50,000 per flight hour.

09:53.240 --> 09:57.100
That means that transatlantic travel costs, just in terms of the flight, would be anywhere

09:57.100 --> 10:03.640
between $650,000 for an East Coast team or up to a full $1 million for West Coast teams.

10:03.640 --> 10:07.640
Teams also tend to carry tens of thousands of pounds of cargo to each away game which

10:07.640 --> 10:09.800
would further escalate the cost.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.960
While such an expense would be little issue for large, wealthy teams like the Dallas Cowboys

10:13.960 --> 10:18.160
or New England Patriots, teams with smaller budgets like the Detroit Lions or Cleveland

10:18.160 --> 10:22.440
Browns would certainly have more of an issue with potentially adding an extra million in

10:22.440 --> 10:23.440
travel costs.

10:23.440 --> 10:28.000
But this level of team isolation is not unprecedented.

10:28.000 --> 10:32.800
Further west, in the middle of the Pacific, the University of Hawaii has a Division I

10:32.800 --> 10:36.020
college football team—the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors.

10:36.020 --> 10:42.020
The closest team in their conference is 2,600 miles or 4,200 kilometers away in San Diego.

10:42.020 --> 10:44.660
To get there, they take a five-hour flight.

10:44.660 --> 10:49.120
That's only an hour or two faster than it would take a London NFL team to get to its

10:49.120 --> 10:51.900
closest competitor—the New England Patriots.

10:51.900 --> 10:55.680
While the furthest team in the Rainbow Warriors conference is only a seven- or eight-hour

10:55.680 --> 11:00.540
flight away in Colorado Springs, Colorado, they do play a number of non-conference games

11:00.540 --> 11:05.220
each year which take them all the way to the US East Coast—an up to ten-hour flight away

11:05.220 --> 11:09.740
from Honolulu which is almost exactly the same as the longest required travel time for

11:09.740 --> 11:11.340
an NFL team to London.

11:11.340 --> 11:15.860
Not only that, but the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors also have to balance their time with class

11:15.860 --> 11:19.780
schedules which means that they travel to their away games far closer to kickoff than

11:19.780 --> 11:22.240
NFL teams typically do to London.

11:22.240 --> 11:26.460
The Rainbow Warriors regularly rack up more travel miles than any professional football

11:26.460 --> 11:27.460
team.

11:27.460 --> 11:31.860
For example, in one particularly grueling month in 2016, the team started its season

11:31.860 --> 11:36.260
with an international match in Sydney, Australia, then the next weekend played in Ann Arbor,

11:36.260 --> 11:41.620
Michigan, then the weekend after that played in Tucson, Arizona, meaning they flew 25,000

11:41.620 --> 11:45.420
miles or 40,000 kilometers in just one month.

11:45.420 --> 11:50.060
The Rainbow Warriors also make most of their trips on commercial flights making their travel

11:50.060 --> 11:52.780
even more difficult than that of NFL teams.

11:52.780 --> 11:57.060
Now, this does potentially give the team a more significant home field advantage since

11:57.060 --> 12:00.420
they're used to playing with jet lag while their opponents, when they fly to Hawaii,

12:00.420 --> 12:04.940
would not be, but it also supports the view that, logistically, it would be possible to

12:04.940 --> 12:07.440
add an NFL team in London.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.380
There are even professional sports leagues that already regularly require travel over

12:11.380 --> 12:13.620
similar or greater distances.

12:13.620 --> 12:18.100
The Continental Hockey League, for example, has teams spread out all across Asia and Eastern

12:18.100 --> 12:22.620
Europe meaning the teams from Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and Beijing regularly have to

12:22.620 --> 12:29.580
travel more than 4,000 miles or 6,500 kilometers to play the teams from Minsk, Riga, and Helsinki.

12:29.580 --> 12:34.540
An even more extreme example would be Super Rugby which has teams spread out across Japan,

12:34.540 --> 12:37.940
Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

12:37.940 --> 12:42.140
With this, when the Tokyo Sun Moles play the Buenos Aires Jaguars, for example, they have

12:42.140 --> 12:49.320
to travel more than 11,000 miles or 18,000 kilometers each way to their match.

12:49.320 --> 12:54.100
Part of the NFL's problem is just the pure scale of their competitions, with many tens

12:54.100 --> 12:58.860
of thousands of pounds of equipment and many hundreds of staff traveling to each game.

12:58.860 --> 13:03.340
The problems are surmountable, though, at a cost, but this cost would be partially burdened

13:03.340 --> 13:05.740
by every other team in the league.

13:05.740 --> 13:10.260
The question is then, given the promise of adding a whole new country to the league,

13:10.260 --> 13:12.340
is the cost worth it?

13:12.340 --> 13:16.900
Now, if the NFL expands to London, one of the first things the new team will need is

13:16.900 --> 13:17.900
a logo.

13:17.900 --> 13:21.300
Luckily, there's a class on Skillshare for that.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.460
Professional animator Fraser Davidson, who actually has done design work for the NFL,

13:25.460 --> 13:28.780
teaches this fantastic course which walks you through the process of creating your own

13:28.780 --> 13:29.780
mascot.

13:29.780 --> 13:34.440
This is just one of over 25,000 classes on Skillshare which each teach you something
