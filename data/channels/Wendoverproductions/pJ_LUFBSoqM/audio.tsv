10260	15640	No sports league in the world makes more money than the American National Football League.
15640	20020	The NFL earns more yearly revenue than the English Premier League, the Champions League,
20020	24000	Formula One, the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball League, and the Continental Hockey
24000	25640	League combined.
25640	30160	It is by far the largest sports league in the world by revenue.
30160	35040	Making up the NFL are 32 football teams each themselves essentially acting as their own
35040	36720	distinct businesses.
36720	41320	These teams are spread out all across the contiguous United States, some only 30 miles
41320	47520	or 45 kilometers apart from each other, some nearly 3,000 miles or 4,500 kilometers apart.
47520	52600	Now, American football teams are some of the largest in sports, both physically and in
52600	53600	numbers.
53600	58240	They have a roster of 56 players, the majority of which play in any given game.
58240	63000	These players weigh on average about 250 pounds or 110 kilograms.
63000	66600	This team size leads to some particular travel needs.
66600	70440	Players each require a first class seat or, at the very least, the seat next to them free
70440	75760	in economy meaning those 56 players take up far more than 56 seats.
75760	80360	On top of that, a team typically brings more than 100 support staff and an immense amount
80360	82960	of cargo to each away game.
82960	87400	With the exception of the largest, most valuable ones, most other professional sports teams
87400	94640	in the US will just fly on chartered narrow-body aircraft like A320s, 737s, or 757s, but most
94640	99200	NFL teams, given their size, require something larger.
99200	104200	NFL teams tend to charter their aircraft from commercial airlines—American, Delta, United,
104200	108200	or Hawaiian airlines—and they'll typically fly something a bit larger than other teams
108200	113480	like a 767 or sometimes even a 777, but the nature of this charter job makes finding a
113480	116320	plane to take them particularly difficult.
116320	120640	You see, let's take the example of the New York Jets' last game of the 2018 season
120640	123920	versus the New England Patriots on December 30th.
123920	130280	For this game, they left the day before on a United Airlines 767-400 at 3.37 pm, landing
130280	134560	30 minutes later at 4.07 pm in Providence, Rhode Island.
134560	139640	The plane then sat on the ground at Providence Airport for the next 26 hours until the game
139640	140640	was over.
140640	144700	The following day, the plane took off at 6.30 pm bound for New York.
144700	148000	The aircraft's previous flight had been to Buenos Aires and its next flight was to
148000	153240	London and yet for these 26 hours, United only made money from the half-hour charter
153240	155320	flight to and from Providence.
155320	159720	It's easy to understand why this wouldn't really be worth it to the airline, but at
159720	164140	least the jets are located next to a United Airlines hub at Newark Airport.
164140	168680	Many teams, like the New Orleans Saints, for example, are not located in a city with any
168680	169820	airline hub.
169820	173820	That makes finding an airline to take their charter contract even more difficult.
173820	178340	That's because, for example, when the team had to travel to Charlotte last season, the
178340	183060	767 that took them had to fly in empty from Houston, the nearest United hub, then fly
183060	188100	to Charlotte, sit on the ground for 33 hours, fly back to New Orleans, then once again fly
188100	190980	empty—this time all the way to New York.
190980	195520	All told, for those 2 hours and 51 minutes of flight time United was paid for, they used
195520	198960	this airplane for almost 44 hours.
198960	203180	Being located away from an airline hub, where planes are based, means charter flights will
203180	207000	almost always require a plane flying in empty.
207000	211340	It is for this reason that airlines are raising rates or just flat out stopping flying NFL
211340	216200	teams as they find normal commercial flying a more lucrative use of their aircraft.
216200	220520	American Airlines, in recent years, for example, dropped all the many teams they previously
220560	225480	flew except for the Carolina Panthers, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Philadelphia Eagles—three
225480	227960	teams located at their hub airports.
227960	232260	More teams have moved their contract to dedicated charter companies such as Atlas Air or Miami
232260	237160	Air International while the New England Patriots even bought their own set of planes to solve
237160	238500	this issue.
238500	241840	Some other teams still have contracts with commercial airlines but have switched to flying
241840	245360	multiple smaller planes as these can be in less demand.
245360	250320	The Indianapolis Colts, for example, now typically travel in two Delta 757s leaving
250320	252560	within a half hour of each other.
252560	256780	Other American sports, such as hockey, baseball, and basketball, don't have nearly as much
256780	261320	of a problem because they play far more games a season which makes their contract a more
261320	266120	attractive one to airlines and they also typically use smaller aircraft of which there are more
266120	267280	available.
267280	271200	The NFL briefly considered investing in its own fleet of aircraft or at least negotiating
271200	276140	a deal with an airline in bulk like the NBA does with Delta, but for now, NFL teams are
276140	281140	seeing their travel costs skyrocket as the laws of supply and demand take hold.
281140	284880	After losing their contract with American Airlines, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars
284880	290680	saw their travel costs double to $4 million a year as they chartered an Atlas Air 747
290680	296440	and remember, those $4 million pay for the travel costs to a mere eight away games.
296440	300840	But the NFL's most daunting logistics problem is not this.
300840	306440	Their most daunting logistics problem relates to the NFL's other big problem—expansion.
306440	311040	You see, part of the reason the NFL is the most valuable sports league in the world is
311040	317840	because of how saturated the football market is in the US—57% of Americans identify as
317840	318840	NFL fans.
318840	324080	That's an amazing level of market saturation for what is, at its core, a business, but
324080	328800	that also presents a problem because, with such a high proportion of the population already
328800	333800	stands, it's quite difficult for the NFL to expand their audience—at least within
333800	334800	the US.
334800	339380	In the past decade or so, the league has turned its attention internationally.
339380	344280	The NFL now plays regular season games in Mexico City and London.
344280	348720	These cities don't have home teams, but rather, two teams from the US will come out
348720	349720	and play.
349720	353540	For the most part, these international games are about promoting the sport in these two
353540	357480	countries which already have significant fan bases watching the sport on TV.
357480	361720	There's never been more than one game a season in Mexico City, but in London, in the
361720	366320	2019 season, they're playing four regular season games.
366320	370980	With the 16 regular season games per team per year, any other city that has a resident
370980	376480	NFL team typically only has eight home games, meaning London's quantity is really not
376480	377680	that far off.
377680	382720	What's more, the Jacksonville Jaguars are designated as a sort of home team for London
382720	386600	and therefore play at least one of their games there each year in an attempt to give the
386600	389200	city and country a clear team to root for.
389200	393320	The league has even said that it plans to eventually have a full eight games per season
393320	397000	in London—the same as any home city in the US.
397000	401440	The reason there are now so many NFL games in London is because the sport of American
401440	405600	football has gained significant inroads in the UK audience.
405600	411240	The NFL estimates that it has 13 million fans in the UK, 4 million of which watch regularly,
411240	416040	and 47,000 of which buy games to every single NFL game in the UK.
416040	422000	Its dedication to the UK has become so significant that it contributed $12.5 million to the construction
422000	425040	of the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in North London.
425040	429800	This recently opened stadium was built to become the home of the NFL in the UK.
429800	434480	It has a permanent synthetic American football pitch under its grass soccer field, purpose-built
434480	439480	NFL-sized locker rooms, and a media suite built to the preferences of NFL press.
439480	444640	In the coming years, at least two NFL games will occur each year at this stadium.
444640	449620	Now, the logistics of these international games in London are formidable.
449620	455280	When the Seahawks played in London in 2018, they had to ship 1,150 rolls of athletic tape,
455280	462440	about 4,000 pounds or 1,800 kilograms of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 shoes, 240
462440	467000	pairs of socks, and tens of thousands of other pounds of equipment to the city weeks ahead
467000	468240	of their arrival.
468240	472280	Months before, they had to arrange for many of their players, who had never left the US,
472280	473680	to get passports.
473720	476800	The team's trainers had to carefully schedule their players' sleep in the week leading
476800	478320	up to reduce jet lag.
478320	483000	There's even a hotel in Watford with a purpose-built American football practice pitch that teams
483000	484000	typically stay in.
484000	489080	While these London matches come at great difficulty and force teams to sacrifice a coveted home
489080	493840	game, the teams and their owners seem to tolerate them given their infrequency and the promise
493840	495000	of the UK market.
495000	499840	But the promise of the UK market could push the NFL to stretch beyond eight international
499840	501480	series games a year there.
501480	506600	You see, there is some very real, very serious discussion of putting a National Football
506600	508640	League team in London.
508640	513280	There is little doubt that the city and country could support a team in terms of fan base.
513280	518040	The issue, according to the league's commissioner, would be having one solitary team stationed
518040	522500	more than 3,000 miles or 5,000 kilometers away from the next.
522500	527260	It would be an immense logistics problem considering that, for the weekly games, teams would have
527260	532020	to take flights as long as 11 hours crossing up to eight time zones.
532020	536260	On the flip side, this London NFL team would have to travel continuously throughout the
536260	540580	US for weeks at a time since, practically, it wouldn't make sense for them to return
540580	542880	to London between the weekly games.
542880	546700	This would come at enormous expense, would likely impact their performance, and prove
546700	548940	unpopular with their players.
548940	554060	In addition, as the UK does not yet have significant American football talent, the majority of
554060	557880	this team's players would come from the US and would need to be persuaded, either
557880	561940	monetarily or otherwise, to live outside their home country.
561940	564500	Those are just some of the cost problems.
564500	570060	Beyond that, it is not cheap to fly a whole NFL team over the Atlantic every week.
570060	574960	For the international series games, teams were flown on chartered Virgin Atlantic 747
574960	580000	or E330s arranged by the league, but if London had a fully fledged NFL team, it would likely
580000	584540	be treated just like any other team meaning both them and their American competitors would
584540	586800	have to arrange their own flights.
586800	590640	The wide-body planes teams would have to charter to cross the Atlantic come at a cost of up
590640	593240	to $50,000 per flight hour.
593240	597100	That means that transatlantic travel costs, just in terms of the flight, would be anywhere
597100	603640	between $650,000 for an East Coast team or up to a full $1 million for West Coast teams.
603640	607640	Teams also tend to carry tens of thousands of pounds of cargo to each away game which
607640	609800	would further escalate the cost.
609800	613960	While such an expense would be little issue for large, wealthy teams like the Dallas Cowboys
613960	618160	or New England Patriots, teams with smaller budgets like the Detroit Lions or Cleveland
618160	622440	Browns would certainly have more of an issue with potentially adding an extra million in
622440	623440	travel costs.
623440	628000	But this level of team isolation is not unprecedented.
628000	632800	Further west, in the middle of the Pacific, the University of Hawaii has a Division I
632800	636020	college football team—the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors.
636020	642020	The closest team in their conference is 2,600 miles or 4,200 kilometers away in San Diego.
642020	644660	To get there, they take a five-hour flight.
644660	649120	That's only an hour or two faster than it would take a London NFL team to get to its
649120	651900	closest competitor—the New England Patriots.
651900	655680	While the furthest team in the Rainbow Warriors conference is only a seven- or eight-hour
655680	660540	flight away in Colorado Springs, Colorado, they do play a number of non-conference games
660540	665220	each year which take them all the way to the US East Coast—an up to ten-hour flight away
665220	669740	from Honolulu which is almost exactly the same as the longest required travel time for
669740	671340	an NFL team to London.
671340	675860	Not only that, but the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors also have to balance their time with class
675860	679780	schedules which means that they travel to their away games far closer to kickoff than
679780	682240	NFL teams typically do to London.
682240	686460	The Rainbow Warriors regularly rack up more travel miles than any professional football
686460	687460	team.
687460	691860	For example, in one particularly grueling month in 2016, the team started its season
691860	696260	with an international match in Sydney, Australia, then the next weekend played in Ann Arbor,
696260	701620	Michigan, then the weekend after that played in Tucson, Arizona, meaning they flew 25,000
701620	705420	miles or 40,000 kilometers in just one month.
705420	710060	The Rainbow Warriors also make most of their trips on commercial flights making their travel
710060	712780	even more difficult than that of NFL teams.
712780	717060	Now, this does potentially give the team a more significant home field advantage since
717060	720420	they're used to playing with jet lag while their opponents, when they fly to Hawaii,
720420	724940	would not be, but it also supports the view that, logistically, it would be possible to
724940	727440	add an NFL team in London.
727440	731380	There are even professional sports leagues that already regularly require travel over
731380	733620	similar or greater distances.
733620	738100	The Continental Hockey League, for example, has teams spread out all across Asia and Eastern
738100	742620	Europe meaning the teams from Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and Beijing regularly have to
742620	749580	travel more than 4,000 miles or 6,500 kilometers to play the teams from Minsk, Riga, and Helsinki.
749580	754540	An even more extreme example would be Super Rugby which has teams spread out across Japan,
754540	757940	Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.
757940	762140	With this, when the Tokyo Sun Moles play the Buenos Aires Jaguars, for example, they have
762140	769320	to travel more than 11,000 miles or 18,000 kilometers each way to their match.
769320	774100	Part of the NFL's problem is just the pure scale of their competitions, with many tens
774100	778860	of thousands of pounds of equipment and many hundreds of staff traveling to each game.
778860	783340	The problems are surmountable, though, at a cost, but this cost would be partially burdened
783340	785740	by every other team in the league.
785740	790260	The question is then, given the promise of adding a whole new country to the league,
790260	792340	is the cost worth it?
792340	796900	Now, if the NFL expands to London, one of the first things the new team will need is
796900	797900	a logo.
797900	801300	Luckily, there's a class on Skillshare for that.
801300	805460	Professional animator Fraser Davidson, who actually has done design work for the NFL,
805460	808780	teaches this fantastic course which walks you through the process of creating your own
808780	809780	mascot.
809780	814440	This is just one of over 25,000 classes on Skillshare which each teach you something
814440	817980	that you can use for your job, for school, or just for fun.
817980	823300	A few more that I would recommend are Storytelling 101, the Productivity Masterclass, and Cinematography
823300	828120	Basics—all of which you can download offline on the iOS and Android apps.
