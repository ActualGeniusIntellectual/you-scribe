00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,640
No sports league in the world makes more money than the American National Football League.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,020
The NFL earns more yearly revenue than the English Premier League, the Champions League,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,000
Formula One, the Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball League, and the Continental Hockey

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,640
League combined.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,160
It is by far the largest sports league in the world by revenue.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
Making up the NFL are 32 football teams each themselves essentially acting as their own

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,720
distinct businesses.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,320
These teams are spread out all across the contiguous United States, some only 30 miles

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,520
or 45 kilometers apart from each other, some nearly 3,000 miles or 4,500 kilometers apart.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,600
Now, American football teams are some of the largest in sports, both physically and in

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
numbers.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,240
They have a roster of 56 players, the majority of which play in any given game.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,000
These players weigh on average about 250 pounds or 110 kilograms.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,600
This team size leads to some particular travel needs.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,440
Players each require a first class seat or, at the very least, the seat next to them free

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,760
in economy meaning those 56 players take up far more than 56 seats.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,360
On top of that, a team typically brings more than 100 support staff and an immense amount

20
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,960
of cargo to each away game.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,400
With the exception of the largest, most valuable ones, most other professional sports teams

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:34,640
in the US will just fly on chartered narrow-body aircraft like A320s, 737s, or 757s, but most

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,200
NFL teams, given their size, require something larger.

24
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
NFL teams tend to charter their aircraft from commercial airlines—American, Delta, United,

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,200
or Hawaiian airlines—and they'll typically fly something a bit larger than other teams

26
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,480
like a 767 or sometimes even a 777, but the nature of this charter job makes finding a

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,320
plane to take them particularly difficult.

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,640
You see, let's take the example of the New York Jets' last game of the 2018 season

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,920
versus the New England Patriots on December 30th.

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,280
For this game, they left the day before on a United Airlines 767-400 at 3.37 pm, landing

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,560
30 minutes later at 4.07 pm in Providence, Rhode Island.

32
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,640
The plane then sat on the ground at Providence Airport for the next 26 hours until the game

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
was over.

34
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,700
The following day, the plane took off at 6.30 pm bound for New York.

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,000
The aircraft's previous flight had been to Buenos Aires and its next flight was to

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,240
London and yet for these 26 hours, United only made money from the half-hour charter

37
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,320
flight to and from Providence.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,720
It's easy to understand why this wouldn't really be worth it to the airline, but at

39
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,140
least the jets are located next to a United Airlines hub at Newark Airport.

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:48,680
Many teams, like the New Orleans Saints, for example, are not located in a city with any

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,820
airline hub.

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
That makes finding an airline to take their charter contract even more difficult.

43
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,340
That's because, for example, when the team had to travel to Charlotte last season, the

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,060
767 that took them had to fly in empty from Houston, the nearest United hub, then fly

45
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,100
to Charlotte, sit on the ground for 33 hours, fly back to New Orleans, then once again fly

46
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,980
empty—this time all the way to New York.

47
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,520
All told, for those 2 hours and 51 minutes of flight time United was paid for, they used

48
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,960
this airplane for almost 44 hours.

49
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,180
Being located away from an airline hub, where planes are based, means charter flights will

50
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,000
almost always require a plane flying in empty.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,340
It is for this reason that airlines are raising rates or just flat out stopping flying NFL

52
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,200
teams as they find normal commercial flying a more lucrative use of their aircraft.

53
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,520
American Airlines, in recent years, for example, dropped all the many teams they previously

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,480
flew except for the Carolina Panthers, the Dallas Cowboys, and the Philadelphia Eagles—three

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,960
teams located at their hub airports.

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,260
More teams have moved their contract to dedicated charter companies such as Atlas Air or Miami

57
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,160
Air International while the New England Patriots even bought their own set of planes to solve

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,500
this issue.

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,840
Some other teams still have contracts with commercial airlines but have switched to flying

60
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
multiple smaller planes as these can be in less demand.

61
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,320
The Indianapolis Colts, for example, now typically travel in two Delta 757s leaving

62
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,560
within a half hour of each other.

63
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,780
Other American sports, such as hockey, baseball, and basketball, don't have nearly as much

64
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,320
of a problem because they play far more games a season which makes their contract a more

65
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,120
attractive one to airlines and they also typically use smaller aircraft of which there are more

66
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,280
available.

67
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,200
The NFL briefly considered investing in its own fleet of aircraft or at least negotiating

68
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,140
a deal with an airline in bulk like the NBA does with Delta, but for now, NFL teams are

69
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,140
seeing their travel costs skyrocket as the laws of supply and demand take hold.

70
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,880
After losing their contract with American Airlines, for example, the Jacksonville Jaguars

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,680
saw their travel costs double to $4 million a year as they chartered an Atlas Air 747

72
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,440
and remember, those $4 million pay for the travel costs to a mere eight away games.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,840
But the NFL's most daunting logistics problem is not this.

74
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,440
Their most daunting logistics problem relates to the NFL's other big problem—expansion.

75
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,040
You see, part of the reason the NFL is the most valuable sports league in the world is

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,840
because of how saturated the football market is in the US—57% of Americans identify as

77
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
NFL fans.

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,080
That's an amazing level of market saturation for what is, at its core, a business, but

79
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,800
that also presents a problem because, with such a high proportion of the population already

80
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,800
stands, it's quite difficult for the NFL to expand their audience—at least within

81
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
the US.

82
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,380
In the past decade or so, the league has turned its attention internationally.

83
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,280
The NFL now plays regular season games in Mexico City and London.

84
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,720
These cities don't have home teams, but rather, two teams from the US will come out

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
and play.

86
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,540
For the most part, these international games are about promoting the sport in these two

87
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,480
countries which already have significant fan bases watching the sport on TV.

88
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,720
There's never been more than one game a season in Mexico City, but in London, in the

89
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,320
2019 season, they're playing four regular season games.

90
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,980
With the 16 regular season games per team per year, any other city that has a resident

91
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,480
NFL team typically only has eight home games, meaning London's quantity is really not

92
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,680
that far off.

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,720
What's more, the Jacksonville Jaguars are designated as a sort of home team for London

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,600
and therefore play at least one of their games there each year in an attempt to give the

95
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,200
city and country a clear team to root for.

96
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,320
The league has even said that it plans to eventually have a full eight games per season

97
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,000
in London—the same as any home city in the US.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,440
The reason there are now so many NFL games in London is because the sport of American

99
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,600
football has gained significant inroads in the UK audience.

100
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,240
The NFL estimates that it has 13 million fans in the UK, 4 million of which watch regularly,

101
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,040
and 47,000 of which buy games to every single NFL game in the UK.

102
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:02,000
Its dedication to the UK has become so significant that it contributed $12.5 million to the construction

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,040
of the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in North London.

104
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,800
This recently opened stadium was built to become the home of the NFL in the UK.

105
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,480
It has a permanent synthetic American football pitch under its grass soccer field, purpose-built

106
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,480
NFL-sized locker rooms, and a media suite built to the preferences of NFL press.

107
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,640
In the coming years, at least two NFL games will occur each year at this stadium.

108
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,620
Now, the logistics of these international games in London are formidable.

109
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:35,280
When the Seahawks played in London in 2018, they had to ship 1,150 rolls of athletic tape,

110
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:42,440
about 4,000 pounds or 1,800 kilograms of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 shoes, 240

111
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,000
pairs of socks, and tens of thousands of other pounds of equipment to the city weeks ahead

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,240
of their arrival.

113
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,280
Months before, they had to arrange for many of their players, who had never left the US,

114
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,680
to get passports.

115
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,800
The team's trainers had to carefully schedule their players' sleep in the week leading

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,320
up to reduce jet lag.

117
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,000
There's even a hotel in Watford with a purpose-built American football practice pitch that teams

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
typically stay in.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,080
While these London matches come at great difficulty and force teams to sacrifice a coveted home

120
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,840
game, the teams and their owners seem to tolerate them given their infrequency and the promise

121
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,000
of the UK market.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,840
But the promise of the UK market could push the NFL to stretch beyond eight international

123
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,480
series games a year there.

124
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,600
You see, there is some very real, very serious discussion of putting a National Football

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,640
League team in London.

126
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,280
There is little doubt that the city and country could support a team in terms of fan base.

127
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,040
The issue, according to the league's commissioner, would be having one solitary team stationed

128
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,500
more than 3,000 miles or 5,000 kilometers away from the next.

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,260
It would be an immense logistics problem considering that, for the weekly games, teams would have

130
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,020
to take flights as long as 11 hours crossing up to eight time zones.

131
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,260
On the flip side, this London NFL team would have to travel continuously throughout the

132
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,580
US for weeks at a time since, practically, it wouldn't make sense for them to return

133
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,880
to London between the weekly games.

134
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,700
This would come at enormous expense, would likely impact their performance, and prove

135
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,940
unpopular with their players.

136
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,060
In addition, as the UK does not yet have significant American football talent, the majority of

137
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,880
this team's players would come from the US and would need to be persuaded, either

138
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,940
monetarily or otherwise, to live outside their home country.

139
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,500
Those are just some of the cost problems.

140
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:30,060
Beyond that, it is not cheap to fly a whole NFL team over the Atlantic every week.

141
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,960
For the international series games, teams were flown on chartered Virgin Atlantic 747

142
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,000
or E330s arranged by the league, but if London had a fully fledged NFL team, it would likely

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,540
be treated just like any other team meaning both them and their American competitors would

144
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,800
have to arrange their own flights.

145
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
The wide-body planes teams would have to charter to cross the Atlantic come at a cost of up

146
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,240
to $50,000 per flight hour.

147
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,100
That means that transatlantic travel costs, just in terms of the flight, would be anywhere

148
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,640
between $650,000 for an East Coast team or up to a full $1 million for West Coast teams.

149
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Teams also tend to carry tens of thousands of pounds of cargo to each away game which

150
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,800
would further escalate the cost.

151
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,960
While such an expense would be little issue for large, wealthy teams like the Dallas Cowboys

152
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,160
or New England Patriots, teams with smaller budgets like the Detroit Lions or Cleveland

153
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,440
Browns would certainly have more of an issue with potentially adding an extra million in

154
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
travel costs.

155
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,000
But this level of team isolation is not unprecedented.

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,800
Further west, in the middle of the Pacific, the University of Hawaii has a Division I

157
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,020
college football team—the Hawaiian Rainbow Warriors.

158
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,020
The closest team in their conference is 2,600 miles or 4,200 kilometers away in San Diego.

159
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,660
To get there, they take a five-hour flight.

160
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,120
That's only an hour or two faster than it would take a London NFL team to get to its

161
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,900
closest competitor—the New England Patriots.

162
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,680
While the furthest team in the Rainbow Warriors conference is only a seven- or eight-hour

163
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,540
flight away in Colorado Springs, Colorado, they do play a number of non-conference games

164
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,220
each year which take them all the way to the US East Coast—an up to ten-hour flight away

165
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,740
from Honolulu which is almost exactly the same as the longest required travel time for

166
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,340
an NFL team to London.

167
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,860
Not only that, but the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors also have to balance their time with class

168
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:19,780
schedules which means that they travel to their away games far closer to kickoff than

169
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:22,240
NFL teams typically do to London.

170
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,460
The Rainbow Warriors regularly rack up more travel miles than any professional football

171
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,460
team.

172
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,860
For example, in one particularly grueling month in 2016, the team started its season

173
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,260
with an international match in Sydney, Australia, then the next weekend played in Ann Arbor,

174
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,620
Michigan, then the weekend after that played in Tucson, Arizona, meaning they flew 25,000

175
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:45,420
miles or 40,000 kilometers in just one month.

176
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,060
The Rainbow Warriors also make most of their trips on commercial flights making their travel

177
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,780
even more difficult than that of NFL teams.

178
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,060
Now, this does potentially give the team a more significant home field advantage since

179
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,420
they're used to playing with jet lag while their opponents, when they fly to Hawaii,

180
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,940
would not be, but it also supports the view that, logistically, it would be possible to

181
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,440
add an NFL team in London.

182
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,380
There are even professional sports leagues that already regularly require travel over

183
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,620
similar or greater distances.

184
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,100
The Continental Hockey League, for example, has teams spread out all across Asia and Eastern

185
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,620
Europe meaning the teams from Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, and Beijing regularly have to

186
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:29,580
travel more than 4,000 miles or 6,500 kilometers to play the teams from Minsk, Riga, and Helsinki.

187
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:34,540
An even more extreme example would be Super Rugby which has teams spread out across Japan,

188
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,940
Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

189
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,140
With this, when the Tokyo Sun Moles play the Buenos Aires Jaguars, for example, they have

190
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:49,320
to travel more than 11,000 miles or 18,000 kilometers each way to their match.

191
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,100
Part of the NFL's problem is just the pure scale of their competitions, with many tens

192
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,860
of thousands of pounds of equipment and many hundreds of staff traveling to each game.

193
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,340
The problems are surmountable, though, at a cost, but this cost would be partially burdened

194
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,740
by every other team in the league.

195
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,260
The question is then, given the promise of adding a whole new country to the league,

196
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,340
is the cost worth it?

197
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,900
Now, if the NFL expands to London, one of the first things the new team will need is

198
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,900
a logo.

199
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,300
Luckily, there's a class on Skillshare for that.

200
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,460
Professional animator Fraser Davidson, who actually has done design work for the NFL,

201
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,780
teaches this fantastic course which walks you through the process of creating your own

202
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,780
mascot.

203
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,440
This is just one of over 25,000 classes on Skillshare which each teach you something

204
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,980
that you can use for your job, for school, or just for fun.

205
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,300
A few more that I would recommend are Storytelling 101, the Productivity Masterclass, and Cinematography

206
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:48,120
Basics—all of which you can download offline on the iOS and Android apps.

207
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,700
You can learn from any of these more than 25,000 classes for free for two months by

208
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,100
signing up at skl.sh slash windover6 and you'll be supporting the show while you're at it.
