This video was made possible by Squarespace.

00:02.880 --> 00:05.180
After this, watch the video I made for their channel.

00:05.180 --> 00:07.560
More about it after the video.

00:07.560 --> 00:12.260
Airports are incredibly complex and challenging businesses but in many cases, they're businesses

00:12.260 --> 00:13.760
that make money.

00:13.760 --> 00:19.040
Many airports are owned by governments but still then, they're often operated as businesses—just

00:19.040 --> 00:20.620
businesses that are publicly owned.

00:20.620 --> 00:24.140
The majority of airports make their money through what they earn from passenger carrying

00:24.140 --> 00:26.720
commercial flights using their facilities.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.800
Some airports are cargo focused and fund their operations through cargo flights but the ones

00:30.800 --> 00:35.380
that you've most heard of, such as London's Heathrow Airport, rely almost entirely on

00:35.380 --> 00:36.640
passenger flights.

00:36.640 --> 00:40.980
While the amount of cargo going through Heathrow is significant thanks to passenger aircraft

00:40.980 --> 00:45.760
carrying cargo in their holds, the number of dedicated cargo flights is low in proportion

00:45.760 --> 00:49.080
to the airport's 650 daily flights.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.320
They make their money off of the 78 million passengers flying through each year.

00:54.320 --> 00:59.340
Heathrow is the busiest airport in the world that is fully privately owned, the UK government

00:59.340 --> 01:04.820
owns no stake in it, and so it is perhaps the best example of an airport built to turn

01:04.820 --> 01:06.180
a profit.

01:06.180 --> 01:13.460
It costs $1,485,650,000 per year to run Heathrow Airport.

01:13.460 --> 01:20.020
That includes costs like the $494 million Heathrow pays in salaries to its 6,500 employees.

01:20.020 --> 01:27.660
Now, 76,000 people actually work at Heathrow but only those 6,500 actually work for Heathrow.

01:27.660 --> 01:32.180
The company that runs Heathrow, Heathrow Airport Holdings, is only really responsible for the

01:32.180 --> 01:34.980
oversight and administration of the airport.

01:34.980 --> 01:38.900
Within Heathrow's walls, though, there are hundreds of other companies operating.

01:38.900 --> 01:43.620
Those 70,000 other people work for the airlines, the baggage handling companies, the air traffic

01:43.620 --> 01:47.940
control company, the restaurants, the rental car companies, the bus companies, and all

01:47.940 --> 01:50.400
the other different employers at the airport.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.580
There are, of course, plenty of other costs involved in running the airport from the $232

01:54.580 --> 02:00.380
million per year in maintenance to the $113 million yearly utility bill for water, electricity,

02:00.380 --> 02:06.380
internet, gas, and more, but overall, that number, $1.5 billion, is what it costs to

02:06.380 --> 02:09.140
run the 6th busiest airport in the world.

02:09.140 --> 02:13.980
That's more than it costs to run the 1.3 million person country of Swaziland.

02:13.980 --> 02:15.940
So how do they pay for that?

02:15.940 --> 02:20.660
On a per-passenger basis, it costs $19 to run Heathrow Airport.

02:20.660 --> 02:25.300
Essentially, that means Heathrow needs to make $19 from each passenger that passes through

02:25.300 --> 02:27.820
its doors in order to break even.

02:27.820 --> 02:31.140
Of course, some passengers are more profitable than others.

02:31.140 --> 02:34.840
Arriving passengers generally just get off the plane, go through customs, and leave immediately

02:34.840 --> 02:39.100
without buying anything while connecting and departing passengers generally have more time

02:39.100 --> 02:41.200
to shop at the airport.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.300
Retail is incredibly important to the profitability of any airport.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.260
This is part of the reason why it's in the airport's best interest to make the

02:48.260 --> 02:54.060
check-in and security process as quick as possible so passengers have more time to shop.

02:54.060 --> 02:58.180
Heathrow makes money through retail by receiving a cut of every sale made.

02:58.180 --> 03:02.660
On average, restaurants earn the airport 95 cents per passenger, retail stores earn them

03:02.660 --> 03:08.660
$5.15 per passenger, the parking lots add on another $2.03, then all the other smaller

03:08.660 --> 03:13.260
sources of retail revenue such as rental car companies and VIP lounges account for another

03:13.260 --> 03:14.260
$3.04.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.880
Rather uniquely, Heathrow also operates the express train from the airport to Paddington

03:18.880 --> 03:23.200
Station in London which makes them another $2.15 per passenger.

03:23.200 --> 03:28.540
All in all, the airport makes $13.32 from passengers through purchases on top of their

03:28.540 --> 03:33.340
actual airplane ticket and, it's worth pointing out, this doesn't mean that passengers spend

03:33.340 --> 03:38.940
$13.32, this means that Heathrow makes $13.32 per passenger.

03:38.940 --> 03:43.460
This is their cut—actual spending at the airport per passenger is much higher.

03:43.660 --> 03:47.980
Now, you may think that this amount of retail revenue per passenger is high and you'd

03:47.980 --> 03:49.380
be right, it is.

03:49.380 --> 03:54.800
In fact, it's one of the highest retail revenues per passenger of any airport worldwide.

03:54.800 --> 04:00.420
In comparison, Washington Dulles Airport makes $5.68 per passenger, Auckland Airport makes

04:00.420 --> 04:06.860
$7.71, and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport makes $10.92 per passenger through retail.

04:06.860 --> 04:10.420
Heathrow is an expert in making passengers spend.

04:10.420 --> 04:14.680
They use all sorts of tricks and tactics to increase passenger spending.

04:14.680 --> 04:19.560
For example, in Terminal 3, to get from security and to the gates, all passengers have to walk

04:19.560 --> 04:22.840
through duty-free which increases sales enormously.

04:22.840 --> 04:27.420
Heathrow also doesn't display the gate for flights until around 45 to 90 minutes before

04:27.420 --> 04:28.420
departure.

04:28.420 --> 04:31.860
This is common in European airports but uncommon elsewhere.

04:31.860 --> 04:36.000
Because of this, passengers wait in the central area where shops and restaurants are until

04:36.000 --> 04:40.160
just before their flight which leads to more time with passengers exposed to the retail

04:40.160 --> 04:41.280
environment.

04:41.280 --> 04:45.720
Being one of the very few airports with non-stop service to all six inhabited continents, Heathrow

04:45.720 --> 04:50.120
also has the advantage of being an airport focused on long-haul service.

04:50.120 --> 04:54.120
These flights tend to carry the wealthiest passengers and, while worldwide passengers

04:54.120 --> 04:58.800
arrive an average of 2 hours and 17 minutes before their flight, Heathrow passengers arrive

04:58.800 --> 05:03.920
2 hours and 51 minutes before which means they have more time to shop at the airport.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.760
As mentioned, though, the airport needs to make $19 per passenger and retail only earns

05:08.760 --> 05:10.800
them just over $13.

05:10.800 --> 05:13.200
The rest of it comes from flights.

05:13.200 --> 05:18.600
Each plane that lands at Heathrow pays the airport an average of $9,500.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.120
Of course it varies hugely by aircraft—a 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 isn't paying the same

05:23.120 --> 05:30.240
as a 345-seat British Airways 747—but $9,500 is the average per visit to Heathrow.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.960
That goes to pay for things like gate space, a check-in area, and the runway time itself.

05:34.960 --> 05:37.840
The airport charges a fixed amount per aircraft landing.

05:37.840 --> 05:45.320
For the small Bombardier Dash 8 it would be $999 while for the large 747 it would be $11,600.

05:45.320 --> 05:49.600
On departure, airlines are then charged again, this time per passenger.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.400
For each passenger flying to a destination outside of Europe, the airline is charged

05:53.400 --> 05:58.160
a base of $58 but this charge is reduced if a passenger connects through Heathrow rather

05:58.160 --> 06:02.680
than originating or if the aircraft is parked at a remote stand rather than a gate.

06:02.680 --> 06:07.760
All in all, a fully loaded 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 flying a domestic route to Edinburgh, for

06:07.760 --> 06:13.400
example, would be charged about $2,400 for its whole visit—arrival and departure—while

06:13.400 --> 06:18.160
that British Airways 747 flying a long-haul route to New York, for example, would be charged

06:18.160 --> 06:19.160
$31,700.

06:19.160 --> 06:23.320
It's worth noting that these are the published prices.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.240
In reality, many airlines with significant number of flights at Heathrow have agreements

06:27.240 --> 06:29.840
with the airport that reduce their costs.

06:29.840 --> 06:34.320
Breaking it down, what those numbers mean is that Heathrow gets, on average, $29 of

06:34.320 --> 06:36.640
the cost of every passenger's ticket.

06:36.640 --> 06:41.580
As you can see, that means that Heathrow makes a fair bit more than it costs to run the airport.

06:41.580 --> 06:45.440
The company mostly uses this operating profit to pay off debt from prior projects and to

06:45.440 --> 06:51.680
pay taxes so in the end, they're only truly making about $8.20 off of each of their passengers.

06:51.680 --> 06:56.180
But what these numbers also mean is that, by design, Heathrow is incentivized to attract

06:56.180 --> 06:57.860
long-haul flights.

06:57.860 --> 07:00.260
The airport is currently at capacity.

07:00.260 --> 07:05.340
Their maximum number of flights per day is 657 and they currently have 650.

07:05.340 --> 07:10.820
They really have no more capacity which means one of the only ways for them to grow financially

07:10.820 --> 07:13.140
is to bring in larger planes.

07:13.140 --> 07:18.100
The 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 takes up the same time on the runway that could be used by another

07:18.100 --> 07:23.900
345-seat British Airways 747 while the airport could make vastly more money by having that

07:23.900 --> 07:25.440
747 land.

07:25.440 --> 07:29.720
This is no doubt part of the reason why Heathrow is so poorly connected to the country that

07:29.720 --> 07:31.220
it's in, the UK.

07:31.220 --> 07:35.860
The airport only has flights to eight airports in the UK which means the airport has exactly

07:35.860 --> 07:40.000
the same number of destinations in the UK as it has in China.

07:40.000 --> 07:45.000
Meanwhile, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands has flights to 25 destinations

07:45.000 --> 07:46.100
in the UK.

07:46.100 --> 07:50.480
That means that for the vast majority of UK residents living outside of London, it's

07:50.480 --> 07:54.280
easier to connect to wherever they're going through Amsterdam than the airport in their

07:54.280 --> 07:55.520
capital city.

07:55.520 --> 07:58.520
The reality is that Heathrow is a commercial company.

07:58.520 --> 08:03.240
While most UK residents would likely want to see domestic flights to their largest airport,

08:03.240 --> 08:07.160
it just doesn't make commercial sense to operate short and cheap flights to Heathrow

08:07.160 --> 08:10.160
in the place of highly lucrative long-haul flights.

08:10.160 --> 08:14.460
It's not only less lucrative for the airport, it's also more costly for the passenger

08:14.460 --> 08:16.980
than flying to other, smaller airports.

08:16.980 --> 08:21.880
Of course, not every airport is like Heathrow, not every airport is a commercial company.

08:21.880 --> 08:26.280
That's just because, in many cases, running an airport the way the public wants it to

08:26.280 --> 08:28.780
be run is bad business.

08:28.780 --> 08:32.720
About two-thirds of all airports worldwide lose money.

08:32.720 --> 08:37.580
In many cases that's because they're government-run and just not that focused on making money.

08:37.580 --> 08:42.660
The US is a country that has not yet gotten around to airport privatization like the UK.

08:42.660 --> 08:47.440
There is only one single privately owned and operated airport in the US with commercial

08:47.440 --> 08:51.160
passenger flights—that's Branson Airport in southern Missouri.

08:51.320 --> 08:55.920
Unlike Heathrow which turns a considerable profit, Branson Airport is losing money and

08:55.920 --> 08:58.800
has struggled to keep airlines flying there for more than a few years.

08:58.800 --> 09:03.120
It's not like Branson was the only attempt at running a private airport in the US.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.760
National Express, a UK-based transport company, took over Newburgh Airport 60 miles north

09:07.760 --> 09:12.660
of New York City in 2000 but it too failed and sold the airport back to the government.

09:12.660 --> 09:17.240
The difference between airport privatization in the US and the UK is that in the US, the

09:17.240 --> 09:21.760
smallest airports went private while in the UK, the largest airports did.

09:21.760 --> 09:26.480
In the UK, 10 of the 15 busiest airports are privately owned and operated.

09:26.480 --> 09:31.320
Meanwhile, only 4 of the 15 least busy airports in the country are privately owned.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.280
That's because small airports, in most cases, just don't make money.

09:36.280 --> 09:40.680
Smaller airports being government-run and unprofitable in the US allow for a sort of

09:40.680 --> 09:43.220
indirect subsidy for airlines to operate there.

09:43.220 --> 09:47.860
In these cases, airports are willingly charging airlines less than it costs to run the airport

09:47.860 --> 09:51.060
to operate there in order to attract them to fly there.

09:51.060 --> 09:55.500
City, county, or state governments are willing to do this because they view air service as

09:55.500 --> 09:57.680
a stimulant to economic development.

09:57.680 --> 10:02.100
The merits of private vs public airport ownership can be debated, but proponents of publicly

10:02.100 --> 10:06.420
owned airports will argue that they're essential pieces of infrastructure while those for airport

10:06.420 --> 10:11.300
privatization will argue that commercial ownership leads to lower costs and better service.

10:11.300 --> 10:15.520
Even in the UK, public opinion is split on whether airports are better off public or

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
private.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.820
What's sure though is that running an airport, whether public or private, is not easy and

10:20.820 --> 10:24.820
that the fact that a few hundred aircraft taking off per day is all it takes to fund

10:24.820 --> 10:30.860
the multi-billion dollar business of Heathrow is almost as impressive as the planes themselves.

10:30.860 --> 10:34.460
Now that you've finished this video, there's another one I made for you to watch.

10:34.460 --> 10:38.740
Squarespace asked me to make a video explaining why design is not a luxury.

10:38.740 --> 10:42.060
That phrase might not make sense now but the whole point of the video I made is to

10:42.060 --> 10:44.620
explain it so make sure to watch it.

10:44.620 --> 10:49.020
You can either click the annotation on screen now or it's linked at the top of the description.

10:49.020 --> 10:52.140
Oh, and fair warning, I go on camera in it.

10:52.140 --> 10:56.580
Thanks for watching and we'll see you again in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

10:56.580 --> 10:57.100
video.
