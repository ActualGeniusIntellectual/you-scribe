00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,180
After this, watch the video I made for their channel.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,560
More about it after the video.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,260
Airports are incredibly complex and challenging businesses but in many cases, they're businesses

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,760
that make money.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,040
Many airports are owned by governments but still then, they're often operated as businesses—just

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,620
businesses that are publicly owned.

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,140
The majority of airports make their money through what they earn from passenger carrying

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,720
commercial flights using their facilities.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,800
Some airports are cargo focused and fund their operations through cargo flights but the ones

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,380
that you've most heard of, such as London's Heathrow Airport, rely almost entirely on

12
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,640
passenger flights.

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,980
While the amount of cargo going through Heathrow is significant thanks to passenger aircraft

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,760
carrying cargo in their holds, the number of dedicated cargo flights is low in proportion

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,080
to the airport's 650 daily flights.

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,320
They make their money off of the 78 million passengers flying through each year.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,340
Heathrow is the busiest airport in the world that is fully privately owned, the UK government

18
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,820
owns no stake in it, and so it is perhaps the best example of an airport built to turn

19
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,180
a profit.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,460
It costs $1,485,650,000 per year to run Heathrow Airport.

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,020
That includes costs like the $494 million Heathrow pays in salaries to its 6,500 employees.

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,660
Now, 76,000 people actually work at Heathrow but only those 6,500 actually work for Heathrow.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,180
The company that runs Heathrow, Heathrow Airport Holdings, is only really responsible for the

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,980
oversight and administration of the airport.

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,900
Within Heathrow's walls, though, there are hundreds of other companies operating.

26
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,620
Those 70,000 other people work for the airlines, the baggage handling companies, the air traffic

27
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,940
control company, the restaurants, the rental car companies, the bus companies, and all

28
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,400
the other different employers at the airport.

29
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,580
There are, of course, plenty of other costs involved in running the airport from the $232

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:00,380
million per year in maintenance to the $113 million yearly utility bill for water, electricity,

31
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:06,380
internet, gas, and more, but overall, that number, $1.5 billion, is what it costs to

32
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,140
run the 6th busiest airport in the world.

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,980
That's more than it costs to run the 1.3 million person country of Swaziland.

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,940
So how do they pay for that?

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,660
On a per-passenger basis, it costs $19 to run Heathrow Airport.

36
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,300
Essentially, that means Heathrow needs to make $19 from each passenger that passes through

37
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,820
its doors in order to break even.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,140
Of course, some passengers are more profitable than others.

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,840
Arriving passengers generally just get off the plane, go through customs, and leave immediately

40
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,100
without buying anything while connecting and departing passengers generally have more time

41
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,200
to shop at the airport.

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,300
Retail is incredibly important to the profitability of any airport.

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,260
This is part of the reason why it's in the airport's best interest to make the

44
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,060
check-in and security process as quick as possible so passengers have more time to shop.

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,180
Heathrow makes money through retail by receiving a cut of every sale made.

46
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,660
On average, restaurants earn the airport 95 cents per passenger, retail stores earn them

47
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,660
$5.15 per passenger, the parking lots add on another $2.03, then all the other smaller

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:13,260
sources of retail revenue such as rental car companies and VIP lounges account for another

49
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
$3.04.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Rather uniquely, Heathrow also operates the express train from the airport to Paddington

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,200
Station in London which makes them another $2.15 per passenger.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,540
All in all, the airport makes $13.32 from passengers through purchases on top of their

53
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:33,340
actual airplane ticket and, it's worth pointing out, this doesn't mean that passengers spend

54
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,940
$13.32, this means that Heathrow makes $13.32 per passenger.

55
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:43,460
This is their cut—actual spending at the airport per passenger is much higher.

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,980
Now, you may think that this amount of retail revenue per passenger is high and you'd

57
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,380
be right, it is.

58
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,800
In fact, it's one of the highest retail revenues per passenger of any airport worldwide.

59
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,420
In comparison, Washington Dulles Airport makes $5.68 per passenger, Auckland Airport makes

60
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,860
$7.71, and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport makes $10.92 per passenger through retail.

61
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,420
Heathrow is an expert in making passengers spend.

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,680
They use all sorts of tricks and tactics to increase passenger spending.

63
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,560
For example, in Terminal 3, to get from security and to the gates, all passengers have to walk

64
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,840
through duty-free which increases sales enormously.

65
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,420
Heathrow also doesn't display the gate for flights until around 45 to 90 minutes before

66
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,420
departure.

67
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,860
This is common in European airports but uncommon elsewhere.

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,000
Because of this, passengers wait in the central area where shops and restaurants are until

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
just before their flight which leads to more time with passengers exposed to the retail

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
environment.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Being one of the very few airports with non-stop service to all six inhabited continents, Heathrow

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,120
also has the advantage of being an airport focused on long-haul service.

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,120
These flights tend to carry the wealthiest passengers and, while worldwide passengers

74
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,800
arrive an average of 2 hours and 17 minutes before their flight, Heathrow passengers arrive

75
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,920
2 hours and 51 minutes before which means they have more time to shop at the airport.

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,760
As mentioned, though, the airport needs to make $19 per passenger and retail only earns

77
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,800
them just over $13.

78
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,200
The rest of it comes from flights.

79
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,600
Each plane that lands at Heathrow pays the airport an average of $9,500.

80
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,120
Of course it varies hugely by aircraft—a 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 isn't paying the same

81
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,240
as a 345-seat British Airways 747—but $9,500 is the average per visit to Heathrow.

82
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,960
That goes to pay for things like gate space, a check-in area, and the runway time itself.

83
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,840
The airport charges a fixed amount per aircraft landing.

84
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,320
For the small Bombardier Dash 8 it would be $999 while for the large 747 it would be $11,600.

85
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,600
On departure, airlines are then charged again, this time per passenger.

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,400
For each passenger flying to a destination outside of Europe, the airline is charged

87
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,160
a base of $58 but this charge is reduced if a passenger connects through Heathrow rather

88
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,680
than originating or if the aircraft is parked at a remote stand rather than a gate.

89
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,760
All in all, a fully loaded 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 flying a domestic route to Edinburgh, for

90
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,400
example, would be charged about $2,400 for its whole visit—arrival and departure—while

91
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,160
that British Airways 747 flying a long-haul route to New York, for example, would be charged

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
$31,700.

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,320
It's worth noting that these are the published prices.

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,240
In reality, many airlines with significant number of flights at Heathrow have agreements

95
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,840
with the airport that reduce their costs.

96
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,320
Breaking it down, what those numbers mean is that Heathrow gets, on average, $29 of

97
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,640
the cost of every passenger's ticket.

98
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,580
As you can see, that means that Heathrow makes a fair bit more than it costs to run the airport.

99
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,440
The company mostly uses this operating profit to pay off debt from prior projects and to

100
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,680
pay taxes so in the end, they're only truly making about $8.20 off of each of their passengers.

101
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,180
But what these numbers also mean is that, by design, Heathrow is incentivized to attract

102
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,860
long-haul flights.

103
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,260
The airport is currently at capacity.

104
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,340
Their maximum number of flights per day is 657 and they currently have 650.

105
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:10,820
They really have no more capacity which means one of the only ways for them to grow financially

106
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,140
is to bring in larger planes.

107
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,100
The 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 takes up the same time on the runway that could be used by another

108
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:23,900
345-seat British Airways 747 while the airport could make vastly more money by having that

109
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,440
747 land.

110
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,720
This is no doubt part of the reason why Heathrow is so poorly connected to the country that

111
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,220
it's in, the UK.

112
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,860
The airport only has flights to eight airports in the UK which means the airport has exactly

113
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,000
the same number of destinations in the UK as it has in China.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Meanwhile, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands has flights to 25 destinations

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,100
in the UK.

116
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,480
That means that for the vast majority of UK residents living outside of London, it's

117
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,280
easier to connect to wherever they're going through Amsterdam than the airport in their

118
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,520
capital city.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,520
The reality is that Heathrow is a commercial company.

120
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,240
While most UK residents would likely want to see domestic flights to their largest airport,

121
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,160
it just doesn't make commercial sense to operate short and cheap flights to Heathrow

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,160
in the place of highly lucrative long-haul flights.

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,460
It's not only less lucrative for the airport, it's also more costly for the passenger

124
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,980
than flying to other, smaller airports.

125
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:21,880
Of course, not every airport is like Heathrow, not every airport is a commercial company.

126
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,280
That's just because, in many cases, running an airport the way the public wants it to

127
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,780
be run is bad business.

128
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,720
About two-thirds of all airports worldwide lose money.

129
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,580
In many cases that's because they're government-run and just not that focused on making money.

130
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,660
The US is a country that has not yet gotten around to airport privatization like the UK.

131
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,440
There is only one single privately owned and operated airport in the US with commercial

132
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,160
passenger flights—that's Branson Airport in southern Missouri.

133
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,920
Unlike Heathrow which turns a considerable profit, Branson Airport is losing money and

134
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,800
has struggled to keep airlines flying there for more than a few years.

135
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,120
It's not like Branson was the only attempt at running a private airport in the US.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,760
National Express, a UK-based transport company, took over Newburgh Airport 60 miles north

137
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,660
of New York City in 2000 but it too failed and sold the airport back to the government.

138
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,240
The difference between airport privatization in the US and the UK is that in the US, the

139
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,760
smallest airports went private while in the UK, the largest airports did.

140
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,480
In the UK, 10 of the 15 busiest airports are privately owned and operated.

141
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,320
Meanwhile, only 4 of the 15 least busy airports in the country are privately owned.

142
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:36,280
That's because small airports, in most cases, just don't make money.

143
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,680
Smaller airports being government-run and unprofitable in the US allow for a sort of

144
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,220
indirect subsidy for airlines to operate there.

145
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,860
In these cases, airports are willingly charging airlines less than it costs to run the airport

146
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,060
to operate there in order to attract them to fly there.

147
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,500
City, county, or state governments are willing to do this because they view air service as

148
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,680
a stimulant to economic development.

149
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,100
The merits of private vs public airport ownership can be debated, but proponents of publicly

150
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,420
owned airports will argue that they're essential pieces of infrastructure while those for airport

151
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,300
privatization will argue that commercial ownership leads to lower costs and better service.

152
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,520
Even in the UK, public opinion is split on whether airports are better off public or

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,520
private.

154
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:20,820
What's sure though is that running an airport, whether public or private, is not easy and

155
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,820
that the fact that a few hundred aircraft taking off per day is all it takes to fund

156
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:30,860
the multi-billion dollar business of Heathrow is almost as impressive as the planes themselves.

157
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,460
Now that you've finished this video, there's another one I made for you to watch.

158
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,740
Squarespace asked me to make a video explaining why design is not a luxury.
