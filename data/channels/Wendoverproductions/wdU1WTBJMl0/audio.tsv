2880	5180	After this, watch the video I made for their channel.
5180	7560	More about it after the video.
7560	12260	Airports are incredibly complex and challenging businesses but in many cases, they're businesses
12260	13760	that make money.
13760	19040	Many airports are owned by governments but still then, they're often operated as businesses—just
19040	20620	businesses that are publicly owned.
20620	24140	The majority of airports make their money through what they earn from passenger carrying
24140	26720	commercial flights using their facilities.
26720	30800	Some airports are cargo focused and fund their operations through cargo flights but the ones
30800	35380	that you've most heard of, such as London's Heathrow Airport, rely almost entirely on
35380	36640	passenger flights.
36640	40980	While the amount of cargo going through Heathrow is significant thanks to passenger aircraft
40980	45760	carrying cargo in their holds, the number of dedicated cargo flights is low in proportion
45760	49080	to the airport's 650 daily flights.
49080	54320	They make their money off of the 78 million passengers flying through each year.
54320	59340	Heathrow is the busiest airport in the world that is fully privately owned, the UK government
59340	64820	owns no stake in it, and so it is perhaps the best example of an airport built to turn
64820	66180	a profit.
66180	73460	It costs $1,485,650,000 per year to run Heathrow Airport.
73460	80020	That includes costs like the $494 million Heathrow pays in salaries to its 6,500 employees.
80020	87660	Now, 76,000 people actually work at Heathrow but only those 6,500 actually work for Heathrow.
87660	92180	The company that runs Heathrow, Heathrow Airport Holdings, is only really responsible for the
92180	94980	oversight and administration of the airport.
94980	98900	Within Heathrow's walls, though, there are hundreds of other companies operating.
98900	103620	Those 70,000 other people work for the airlines, the baggage handling companies, the air traffic
103620	107940	control company, the restaurants, the rental car companies, the bus companies, and all
107940	110400	the other different employers at the airport.
110400	114580	There are, of course, plenty of other costs involved in running the airport from the $232
114580	120380	million per year in maintenance to the $113 million yearly utility bill for water, electricity,
120380	126380	internet, gas, and more, but overall, that number, $1.5 billion, is what it costs to
126380	129140	run the 6th busiest airport in the world.
129140	133980	That's more than it costs to run the 1.3 million person country of Swaziland.
133980	135940	So how do they pay for that?
135940	140660	On a per-passenger basis, it costs $19 to run Heathrow Airport.
140660	145300	Essentially, that means Heathrow needs to make $19 from each passenger that passes through
145300	147820	its doors in order to break even.
147820	151140	Of course, some passengers are more profitable than others.
151140	154840	Arriving passengers generally just get off the plane, go through customs, and leave immediately
154840	159100	without buying anything while connecting and departing passengers generally have more time
159100	161200	to shop at the airport.
161200	165300	Retail is incredibly important to the profitability of any airport.
165300	168260	This is part of the reason why it's in the airport's best interest to make the
168260	174060	check-in and security process as quick as possible so passengers have more time to shop.
174060	178180	Heathrow makes money through retail by receiving a cut of every sale made.
178180	182660	On average, restaurants earn the airport 95 cents per passenger, retail stores earn them
182660	188660	$5.15 per passenger, the parking lots add on another $2.03, then all the other smaller
188660	193260	sources of retail revenue such as rental car companies and VIP lounges account for another
193260	194260	$3.04.
195160	198880	Rather uniquely, Heathrow also operates the express train from the airport to Paddington
198880	203200	Station in London which makes them another $2.15 per passenger.
203200	208540	All in all, the airport makes $13.32 from passengers through purchases on top of their
208540	213340	actual airplane ticket and, it's worth pointing out, this doesn't mean that passengers spend
213340	218940	$13.32, this means that Heathrow makes $13.32 per passenger.
218940	223460	This is their cut—actual spending at the airport per passenger is much higher.
223660	227980	Now, you may think that this amount of retail revenue per passenger is high and you'd
227980	229380	be right, it is.
229380	234800	In fact, it's one of the highest retail revenues per passenger of any airport worldwide.
234800	240420	In comparison, Washington Dulles Airport makes $5.68 per passenger, Auckland Airport makes
240420	246860	$7.71, and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport makes $10.92 per passenger through retail.
246860	250420	Heathrow is an expert in making passengers spend.
250420	254680	They use all sorts of tricks and tactics to increase passenger spending.
254680	259560	For example, in Terminal 3, to get from security and to the gates, all passengers have to walk
259560	262840	through duty-free which increases sales enormously.
262840	267420	Heathrow also doesn't display the gate for flights until around 45 to 90 minutes before
267420	268420	departure.
268420	271860	This is common in European airports but uncommon elsewhere.
271860	276000	Because of this, passengers wait in the central area where shops and restaurants are until
276000	280160	just before their flight which leads to more time with passengers exposed to the retail
280160	281280	environment.
281280	285720	Being one of the very few airports with non-stop service to all six inhabited continents, Heathrow
285720	290120	also has the advantage of being an airport focused on long-haul service.
290120	294120	These flights tend to carry the wealthiest passengers and, while worldwide passengers
294120	298800	arrive an average of 2 hours and 17 minutes before their flight, Heathrow passengers arrive
298800	303920	2 hours and 51 minutes before which means they have more time to shop at the airport.
303920	308760	As mentioned, though, the airport needs to make $19 per passenger and retail only earns
308760	310800	them just over $13.
310800	313200	The rest of it comes from flights.
313200	318600	Each plane that lands at Heathrow pays the airport an average of $9,500.
318600	323120	Of course it varies hugely by aircraft—a 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 isn't paying the same
323120	330240	as a 345-seat British Airways 747—but $9,500 is the average per visit to Heathrow.
330240	334960	That goes to pay for things like gate space, a check-in area, and the runway time itself.
334960	337840	The airport charges a fixed amount per aircraft landing.
337840	345320	For the small Bombardier Dash 8 it would be $999 while for the large 747 it would be $11,600.
345320	349600	On departure, airlines are then charged again, this time per passenger.
349600	353400	For each passenger flying to a destination outside of Europe, the airline is charged
353400	358160	a base of $58 but this charge is reduced if a passenger connects through Heathrow rather
358160	362680	than originating or if the aircraft is parked at a remote stand rather than a gate.
362680	367760	All in all, a fully loaded 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 flying a domestic route to Edinburgh, for
367760	373400	example, would be charged about $2,400 for its whole visit—arrival and departure—while
373400	378160	that British Airways 747 flying a long-haul route to New York, for example, would be charged
378160	379160	$31,700.
379160	383320	It's worth noting that these are the published prices.
383320	387240	In reality, many airlines with significant number of flights at Heathrow have agreements
387240	389840	with the airport that reduce their costs.
389840	394320	Breaking it down, what those numbers mean is that Heathrow gets, on average, $29 of
394320	396640	the cost of every passenger's ticket.
396640	401580	As you can see, that means that Heathrow makes a fair bit more than it costs to run the airport.
401580	405440	The company mostly uses this operating profit to pay off debt from prior projects and to
405440	411680	pay taxes so in the end, they're only truly making about $8.20 off of each of their passengers.
411680	416180	But what these numbers also mean is that, by design, Heathrow is incentivized to attract
416180	417860	long-haul flights.
417860	420260	The airport is currently at capacity.
420260	425340	Their maximum number of flights per day is 657 and they currently have 650.
425340	430820	They really have no more capacity which means one of the only ways for them to grow financially
430820	433140	is to bring in larger planes.
433140	438100	The 76-seat Flybe Dash 8 takes up the same time on the runway that could be used by another
438100	443900	345-seat British Airways 747 while the airport could make vastly more money by having that
443900	445440	747 land.
445440	449720	This is no doubt part of the reason why Heathrow is so poorly connected to the country that
449720	451220	it's in, the UK.
451220	455860	The airport only has flights to eight airports in the UK which means the airport has exactly
455860	460000	the same number of destinations in the UK as it has in China.
460000	465000	Meanwhile, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands has flights to 25 destinations
465000	466100	in the UK.
466100	470480	That means that for the vast majority of UK residents living outside of London, it's
470480	474280	easier to connect to wherever they're going through Amsterdam than the airport in their
474280	475520	capital city.
475520	478520	The reality is that Heathrow is a commercial company.
478520	483240	While most UK residents would likely want to see domestic flights to their largest airport,
483240	487160	it just doesn't make commercial sense to operate short and cheap flights to Heathrow
487160	490160	in the place of highly lucrative long-haul flights.
490160	494460	It's not only less lucrative for the airport, it's also more costly for the passenger
494460	496980	than flying to other, smaller airports.
496980	501880	Of course, not every airport is like Heathrow, not every airport is a commercial company.
501880	506280	That's just because, in many cases, running an airport the way the public wants it to
506280	508780	be run is bad business.
508780	512720	About two-thirds of all airports worldwide lose money.
512720	517580	In many cases that's because they're government-run and just not that focused on making money.
517580	522660	The US is a country that has not yet gotten around to airport privatization like the UK.
522660	527440	There is only one single privately owned and operated airport in the US with commercial
527440	531160	passenger flights—that's Branson Airport in southern Missouri.
531320	535920	Unlike Heathrow which turns a considerable profit, Branson Airport is losing money and
535920	538800	has struggled to keep airlines flying there for more than a few years.
538800	543120	It's not like Branson was the only attempt at running a private airport in the US.
543120	547760	National Express, a UK-based transport company, took over Newburgh Airport 60 miles north
547760	552660	of New York City in 2000 but it too failed and sold the airport back to the government.
552660	557240	The difference between airport privatization in the US and the UK is that in the US, the
557240	561760	smallest airports went private while in the UK, the largest airports did.
561760	566480	In the UK, 10 of the 15 busiest airports are privately owned and operated.
566480	571320	Meanwhile, only 4 of the 15 least busy airports in the country are privately owned.
571320	576280	That's because small airports, in most cases, just don't make money.
576280	580680	Smaller airports being government-run and unprofitable in the US allow for a sort of
580680	583220	indirect subsidy for airlines to operate there.
583220	587860	In these cases, airports are willingly charging airlines less than it costs to run the airport
587860	591060	to operate there in order to attract them to fly there.
591060	595500	City, county, or state governments are willing to do this because they view air service as
595500	597680	a stimulant to economic development.
597680	602100	The merits of private vs public airport ownership can be debated, but proponents of publicly
602100	606420	owned airports will argue that they're essential pieces of infrastructure while those for airport
606420	611300	privatization will argue that commercial ownership leads to lower costs and better service.
611300	615520	Even in the UK, public opinion is split on whether airports are better off public or
615520	616520	private.
616520	620820	What's sure though is that running an airport, whether public or private, is not easy and
620820	624820	that the fact that a few hundred aircraft taking off per day is all it takes to fund
624820	630860	the multi-billion dollar business of Heathrow is almost as impressive as the planes themselves.
630860	634460	Now that you've finished this video, there's another one I made for you to watch.
634460	638740	Squarespace asked me to make a video explaining why design is not a luxury.
638740	642060	That phrase might not make sense now but the whole point of the video I made is to
642060	644620	explain it so make sure to watch it.
644620	649020	You can either click the annotation on screen now or it's linked at the top of the description.
649020	652140	Oh, and fair warning, I go on camera in it.
652140	656580	Thanks for watching and we'll see you again in two weeks for another Wendover Productions
656580	657100	video.
