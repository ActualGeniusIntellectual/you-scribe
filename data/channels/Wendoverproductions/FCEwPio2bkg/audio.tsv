9520	14620	Twenty years ago, the western world didn't really think of China as a market.
14620	19660	The country was an asset for the west's own market, sure, but only for the reason
19660	24200	that it was a large, poor country that could act as a source of low-cost labor.
24200	29460	Today, though, with an economy ten times larger than that of just twenty years ago, the western
29460	35580	world, or at least the properly informed western world, no longer thinks of China as that poor,
35580	41100	low-cost labor asset, but rather, as a significant, attractive market itself.
41100	46020	Whereas in the past China made for the west, today China is the very market that the western
46020	48740	world focuses their attention on.
48740	53460	With a rapidly growing middle and upper class, businesses around the world have flooded in
53460	57580	to cater to China's newly wealthy in the same way that they have long served the rich
57580	59740	in the wealthy western world.
59740	64820	Industries ranging from hospitality to tourism to e-commerce to beauty and more are all thriving
64820	69340	there with both homegrown and foreign-born players establishing their spots in the Chinese
69340	73840	market, but one enormous industry that is still emerging and evolving in the Middle
73840	77060	Kingdom is that of sports.
77060	82260	Sports is a monstrous global industry, but nowhere is that industry more enormous than
82260	83460	in the US.
83460	90220	The NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL represent the first, second, fourth, and six most valuable
90220	96260	sports leagues in the world and collectively bring in more than $30 billion in annual revenue.
96260	100420	However, American sports are not purely an American industry.
100420	104260	Between merchandising, league partnerships, TV and streaming rights, and other revenue
104260	109380	streams, American sports leagues actually earn a considerable amount of money outside
109380	110700	of America.
110740	115580	China is a market worth targeting for any business, but it has a particular appeal for
115580	116940	sports leagues.
116940	122320	Beyond its status as a large and relatively recently wealthy nation, China has a government
122320	126740	willing and interested in investing in foreign sports—the kind of foreign sports that would
126740	129780	earn them prestige in international competitions.
129780	134100	Each of the four major American sports leagues are the dominant leagues in the world for
134100	139340	their respective sports, so any interest in each sport will lead to interest in their
139340	140340	league.
140980	147420	Each league has its own strategy to grow Chinese interest both in their sport and their league.
147420	152900	Baseball is incredibly popular in nearby Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, and so there was reason
152900	156580	to believe that the sport could too become popular in China.
156580	160740	Despite this, though, major league baseball has demonstrated the least interest in the
160740	165100	market, and the market has demonstrated the least interest in the MLB.
165100	169920	The league's most tangible effort to attract Chinese audiences took place back in 2008
170000	174040	when two preseason games between the Padres and Dodgers were played in Beijing.
174040	178080	Since then, the history of baseball in China has been fraught with difficulties with their
178080	182580	national league, which operated in cooperation with the American MLB, suspending operations
182580	191120	in 2012, restarting in 2014, suspending operations again in 2016, then starting up again in 2019
191120	193020	with just four teams.
193020	197980	The MLB has also long operated three development centers where top Chinese baseball players
197980	202940	are trained, although none of the players from these centers have ever actually seen
202940	205580	action in the MLB itself.
205580	209940	When confined press release upon press release about different renewed efforts by the MLB
209940	216020	to grow the sport in China, however, all signs indicate that these have not resulted in much.
216020	220320	Evidence of this can be seen on the league's official Weibo account—one of the top social
220320	224960	networks in China—which has only 650,000 followers.
224960	230600	The story is not markedly different with the NHL, but the history of its efforts is shorter.
230600	235900	It put on exhibition matches between the Kings and Canucks in Shanghai and Beijing in 2017,
235900	240000	then between the Bruins and Flames in Beijing and Shenzhen in 2018.
240000	244080	These games were generally well-received and were attended by healthy-sized audiences,
244080	248460	but there was a conspicuous lack of follow-up, with no 2019 games in China, reportedly due
248460	250880	to issues with booking arenas.
250880	254720	Since then, though, they've doubled down, sending Stanley Cup champion Alex Ovechkin
254720	259320	to the country in summer 2019 to promote the sport, opening an office in Beijing, and hiring
259320	260840	a China marketing head.
260840	265660	Unfortunately for them, though, the little attention China pays to hockey is not primarily
265660	267820	directed to the NHL.
267820	271960	The second most lucrative hockey league in the world, the Continental Hockey League,
271960	277160	added a Chinese team in 2016—the HC Kunlun Red Star.
277160	281880	The team is no phenomenon yet, with the lowest average game attendance in the league, but
281880	287160	it does mean that a Chinese hockey fan would much more likely pay attention to the KHL
287160	288160	over the NHL.
288160	293640	Still, though, the NHL seems to get somewhat more respectable Chinese engagement—demonstrated
293640	296720	by their just over 1 million fans on Weibo.
296720	300440	American football, though, is where it starts to get interesting.
300440	306340	The NFL has generated a real fan base among Chinese—not a large one, but it certainly
306340	307760	exists.
307760	312020	This is despite the fact that they are the only of the four leagues that has not played
312020	313680	a game in China.
313680	317600	There is talk of putting one on in the country at the start of the 2020 season, although,
317600	320580	there's been talk before without result.
320580	326080	The real potential for the NFL, though, comes not through in-country games, but rather through
326080	327800	digital distribution.
327800	332320	Each week, Tencent's streaming platforms broadcast a number of games which each have
332320	336000	an average viewership of more than 2 million people.
336000	340500	That's despite the awkward broadcast times in the mid-morning, given the time difference.
340500	345120	How much the NFL was paid for these broadcast rights is not publicly known, but with those
345120	348120	kind of numbers, it's certainly not nothing.
348120	352240	Beyond the league as a whole's efforts, the New England Patriots have put a particular
352240	355360	level of effort into attracting Chinese fans.
355360	360020	A huge benefit for them is that their star, Tom Brady, has been learning and speaks a
360020	362180	rudimentary level of Mandarin.
362180	366020	He hosted a Chinese-language show for the team's digital channels which attracted
366020	369780	sizable attention—over 15 million total views.
369780	374900	Meanwhile, playing the sport itself is increasingly popular in China—having one's children
374900	380340	learn the American sport has emerged as a status symbol, and 120,000 young Chinese have
380340	383260	gone to private training camps for American football.
383260	389140	Still though, the NFL has a long way to go to make China a sizable portion of its business.
389140	394820	On Weibo, for example, it has only attracted slightly more fans than the NHL at 1.3 million.
394820	399920	The final of these four leagues, though, has turned China into a sizable and now crucial
399920	402180	bit of its business.
402180	406740	Basketball has been played casually in China since the late 1800s when American missionaries
406740	408700	first introduced the sport.
408700	413580	As China liberalized in the latter half of the 20th century, the NBA capitalized on this
413580	418380	and then-commissioner David Stern led an effort to get their games televised in China.
418380	424300	This attracted a moderate fanbase, but the true, pivotal moment happened in 2002.
424300	429240	In that year, a young player from the Shanghai Sharks entered the NBA draft and was picked
429240	432400	first overall—Yao Ming.
432400	437100	He quickly became a sensation and reached the NBA All-Star team eight times, but as
437100	443020	much as he was a sensation in the US, he was just as much or more back home in China.
443020	448300	The number of Chinese NBA fans grew exponentially with every game he played, but eventually,
448300	452780	after a series of injury-plagued seasons, Ming retired in 2011.
452780	457120	At the time, anyone would have assumed that this would have been the end of the NBA's
457120	460940	rise in China, but as it turned out, this was not the case.
460940	465320	While at first Chinese fans may have tuned in to watch Yao Ming, eventually they just
465320	467640	tuned in to watch the NBA.
467640	472580	In the decade following Ming's retirement, China grew into an enormous, crucial part
472580	478260	of the NBA's business, representing more than $500 million a year in revenue.
478260	485220	However, in October 2019, this was all threatened by one tweet containing one image.
485220	489000	It read, fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.
489000	493780	This was, of course, a reference in support of the widespread protests in Hong Kong—protests
493780	498580	commonly characterized as anti-Beijing—but what's more important is who this tweet
498580	499900	was by.
499900	503980	Daryl Moret, the general manager of the Houston Rockets.
503980	508880	All of a sudden, deals fell apart, relationships were severed, game broadcasts were cancelled,
508880	514180	the NBA's China market was under threat due to a perception that the league was anti-China.
514180	519420	Unsurprisingly for business reasons, the NBA quickly issued what was essentially an apology
519420	520620	for this tweet.
520620	525740	Of course, following that, the NBA both faced criticism from China for the original tweet
525740	529260	and from the US for apologizing for that tweet.
529260	533020	Eventually, the scandal largely blew over and relationships started to inch back to
533020	538740	normal, but this was all indicative of a bigger issue with American sports' expansion into
538740	539740	China.
539740	545020	What these leagues are doing is selling one product to two very different markets.
545020	550160	Worldwide, the entertainment industry, of which sports is a part of, has become increasingly
550160	555300	homogenized with more and more people watching the same TV shows, listening to the same music,
555300	559380	and going to the same movies no matter which country or culture they come from.
559380	562020	China, meanwhile, is different.
562020	566460	Chinese people largely watch different TV shows, listen to different music, and go to
566460	568700	different movies than the rest of us.
568700	572740	A lot of this is because of government censorship and import policy.
572740	577500	For example, there's a quota allowing only a small number of foreign films into Chinese
577500	578900	cinemas each year.
578900	582860	Sports, though, can't be treated like the rest of entertainment.
582860	587840	The sports entertainment experience in the 21st century stretches far beyond just the
587840	593500	viewing of actual games—in fact, watching the games in their entirety is hardly even
593500	595420	a requirement anymore.
595420	601500	Sports is an all-encompassing, unscripted, uncensored entertainment experience, and this
601500	606100	is the problem for China—it can't just edit out an unflattering aspect of sports
606100	609220	in the same way it can with foreign films.
609220	612960	Sports and politics in the US are intrinsically intertwined.
612960	617580	Many athletes naturally take their place as political activists given their influence,
617580	620700	but this is very different from in China.
620700	626320	In China, sports is a game where athletes go and play, someone wins, and then everyone
626320	627320	goes home.
627320	632920	That's because, in China, entertainment and politics stay far, far away from each
632920	638660	other—or perhaps more accurately, entertainment and opposition politics stay far, far away
638660	640020	from each other.
640020	644180	American sports will continue their march towards increased relevancy in China as it,
644180	647780	as a country, has an under-saturated spectator sports market.
647780	652620	Meanwhile, though, if these leagues become a true phenomenon in China, they'll have
652620	657660	to make more tough calls as to whether they want to be a sports league for the US or for
657660	660380	the world.
660380	664180	In my opinion, the behind-the-scenes of sports is fascinating.
664180	668660	If you agree, but feel you've gotten enough of the business side for now, you can learn
668660	671320	a little more about the physics side.
671320	675180	You can learn how climbers figure out how elastic their ropes should be—elastic enough
675180	678740	to not give them whiplash when they fall, but not elastic enough to let them hit the
678740	679740	ground.
679740	683000	You can learn how energy transforms when a skier descends a slope, you can learn how
683000	687800	archers account for gravity in their aim, and you can learn all of this on Brilliant.
687800	692140	These are just some of the interesting, engaging things that you can learn about while you're
692140	697020	actually learning classical mechanics on Brilliant—something decisively less engaging
697020	699640	than climbing, skiing, or archery.
699640	703420	The teaching and learning style is what makes Brilliant so effective for the kind of things
703420	707360	that you might want to learn, but previously were too daunted, too.
707360	710900	If your New Year's resolution was to learn more, to improve yourself, or to challenge
710900	713980	yourself, Brilliant is the place to start.
713980	718700	They help you achieve your goals in STEM, and, to make it easier, the first 200 people
