00:09.520 --> 00:14.620
Twenty years ago, the western world didn't really think of China as a market.

00:14.620 --> 00:19.660
The country was an asset for the west's own market, sure, but only for the reason

00:19.660 --> 00:24.200
that it was a large, poor country that could act as a source of low-cost labor.

00:24.200 --> 00:29.460
Today, though, with an economy ten times larger than that of just twenty years ago, the western

00:29.460 --> 00:35.580
world, or at least the properly informed western world, no longer thinks of China as that poor,

00:35.580 --> 00:41.100
low-cost labor asset, but rather, as a significant, attractive market itself.

00:41.100 --> 00:46.020
Whereas in the past China made for the west, today China is the very market that the western

00:46.020 --> 00:48.740
world focuses their attention on.

00:48.740 --> 00:53.460
With a rapidly growing middle and upper class, businesses around the world have flooded in

00:53.460 --> 00:57.580
to cater to China's newly wealthy in the same way that they have long served the rich

00:57.580 --> 00:59.740
in the wealthy western world.

00:59.740 --> 01:04.820
Industries ranging from hospitality to tourism to e-commerce to beauty and more are all thriving

01:04.820 --> 01:09.340
there with both homegrown and foreign-born players establishing their spots in the Chinese

01:09.340 --> 01:13.840
market, but one enormous industry that is still emerging and evolving in the Middle

01:13.840 --> 01:17.060
Kingdom is that of sports.

01:17.060 --> 01:22.260
Sports is a monstrous global industry, but nowhere is that industry more enormous than

01:22.260 --> 01:23.460
in the US.

01:23.460 --> 01:30.220
The NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL represent the first, second, fourth, and six most valuable

01:30.220 --> 01:36.260
sports leagues in the world and collectively bring in more than $30 billion in annual revenue.

01:36.260 --> 01:40.420
However, American sports are not purely an American industry.

01:40.420 --> 01:44.260
Between merchandising, league partnerships, TV and streaming rights, and other revenue

01:44.260 --> 01:49.380
streams, American sports leagues actually earn a considerable amount of money outside

01:49.380 --> 01:50.700
of America.

01:50.740 --> 01:55.580
China is a market worth targeting for any business, but it has a particular appeal for

01:55.580 --> 01:56.940
sports leagues.

01:56.940 --> 02:02.320
Beyond its status as a large and relatively recently wealthy nation, China has a government

02:02.320 --> 02:06.740
willing and interested in investing in foreign sports—the kind of foreign sports that would

02:06.740 --> 02:09.780
earn them prestige in international competitions.

02:09.780 --> 02:14.100
Each of the four major American sports leagues are the dominant leagues in the world for

02:14.100 --> 02:19.340
their respective sports, so any interest in each sport will lead to interest in their

02:19.340 --> 02:20.340
league.

02:20.980 --> 02:27.420
Each league has its own strategy to grow Chinese interest both in their sport and their league.

02:27.420 --> 02:32.900
Baseball is incredibly popular in nearby Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, and so there was reason

02:32.900 --> 02:36.580
to believe that the sport could too become popular in China.

02:36.580 --> 02:40.740
Despite this, though, major league baseball has demonstrated the least interest in the

02:40.740 --> 02:45.100
market, and the market has demonstrated the least interest in the MLB.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.920
The league's most tangible effort to attract Chinese audiences took place back in 2008

02:50.000 --> 02:54.040
when two preseason games between the Padres and Dodgers were played in Beijing.

02:54.040 --> 02:58.080
Since then, the history of baseball in China has been fraught with difficulties with their

02:58.080 --> 03:02.580
national league, which operated in cooperation with the American MLB, suspending operations

03:02.580 --> 03:11.120
in 2012, restarting in 2014, suspending operations again in 2016, then starting up again in 2019

03:11.120 --> 03:13.020
with just four teams.

03:13.020 --> 03:17.980
The MLB has also long operated three development centers where top Chinese baseball players

03:17.980 --> 03:22.940
are trained, although none of the players from these centers have ever actually seen

03:22.940 --> 03:25.580
action in the MLB itself.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.940
When confined press release upon press release about different renewed efforts by the MLB

03:29.940 --> 03:36.020
to grow the sport in China, however, all signs indicate that these have not resulted in much.

03:36.020 --> 03:40.320
Evidence of this can be seen on the league's official Weibo account—one of the top social

03:40.320 --> 03:44.960
networks in China—which has only 650,000 followers.

03:44.960 --> 03:50.600
The story is not markedly different with the NHL, but the history of its efforts is shorter.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.900
It put on exhibition matches between the Kings and Canucks in Shanghai and Beijing in 2017,

03:55.900 --> 04:00.000
then between the Bruins and Flames in Beijing and Shenzhen in 2018.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.080
These games were generally well-received and were attended by healthy-sized audiences,

04:04.080 --> 04:08.460
but there was a conspicuous lack of follow-up, with no 2019 games in China, reportedly due

04:08.460 --> 04:10.880
to issues with booking arenas.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.720
Since then, though, they've doubled down, sending Stanley Cup champion Alex Ovechkin

04:14.720 --> 04:19.320
to the country in summer 2019 to promote the sport, opening an office in Beijing, and hiring

04:19.320 --> 04:20.840
a China marketing head.

04:20.840 --> 04:25.660
Unfortunately for them, though, the little attention China pays to hockey is not primarily

04:25.660 --> 04:27.820
directed to the NHL.

04:27.820 --> 04:31.960
The second most lucrative hockey league in the world, the Continental Hockey League,

04:31.960 --> 04:37.160
added a Chinese team in 2016—the HC Kunlun Red Star.

04:37.160 --> 04:41.880
The team is no phenomenon yet, with the lowest average game attendance in the league, but

04:41.880 --> 04:47.160
it does mean that a Chinese hockey fan would much more likely pay attention to the KHL

04:47.160 --> 04:48.160
over the NHL.

04:48.160 --> 04:53.640
Still, though, the NHL seems to get somewhat more respectable Chinese engagement—demonstrated

04:53.640 --> 04:56.720
by their just over 1 million fans on Weibo.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.440
American football, though, is where it starts to get interesting.

05:00.440 --> 05:06.340
The NFL has generated a real fan base among Chinese—not a large one, but it certainly

05:06.340 --> 05:07.760
exists.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.020
This is despite the fact that they are the only of the four leagues that has not played

05:12.020 --> 05:13.680
a game in China.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.600
There is talk of putting one on in the country at the start of the 2020 season, although,

05:17.600 --> 05:20.580
there's been talk before without result.

05:20.580 --> 05:26.080
The real potential for the NFL, though, comes not through in-country games, but rather through

05:26.080 --> 05:27.800
digital distribution.

05:27.800 --> 05:32.320
Each week, Tencent's streaming platforms broadcast a number of games which each have

05:32.320 --> 05:36.000
an average viewership of more than 2 million people.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.500
That's despite the awkward broadcast times in the mid-morning, given the time difference.

05:40.500 --> 05:45.120
How much the NFL was paid for these broadcast rights is not publicly known, but with those

05:45.120 --> 05:48.120
kind of numbers, it's certainly not nothing.

05:48.120 --> 05:52.240
Beyond the league as a whole's efforts, the New England Patriots have put a particular

05:52.240 --> 05:55.360
level of effort into attracting Chinese fans.

05:55.360 --> 06:00.020
A huge benefit for them is that their star, Tom Brady, has been learning and speaks a

06:00.020 --> 06:02.180
rudimentary level of Mandarin.

06:02.180 --> 06:06.020
He hosted a Chinese-language show for the team's digital channels which attracted

06:06.020 --> 06:09.780
sizable attention—over 15 million total views.

06:09.780 --> 06:14.900
Meanwhile, playing the sport itself is increasingly popular in China—having one's children

06:14.900 --> 06:20.340
learn the American sport has emerged as a status symbol, and 120,000 young Chinese have

06:20.340 --> 06:23.260
gone to private training camps for American football.

06:23.260 --> 06:29.140
Still though, the NFL has a long way to go to make China a sizable portion of its business.

06:29.140 --> 06:34.820
On Weibo, for example, it has only attracted slightly more fans than the NHL at 1.3 million.

06:34.820 --> 06:39.920
The final of these four leagues, though, has turned China into a sizable and now crucial

06:39.920 --> 06:42.180
bit of its business.

06:42.180 --> 06:46.740
Basketball has been played casually in China since the late 1800s when American missionaries

06:46.740 --> 06:48.700
first introduced the sport.

06:48.700 --> 06:53.580
As China liberalized in the latter half of the 20th century, the NBA capitalized on this

06:53.580 --> 06:58.380
and then-commissioner David Stern led an effort to get their games televised in China.

06:58.380 --> 07:04.300
This attracted a moderate fanbase, but the true, pivotal moment happened in 2002.

07:04.300 --> 07:09.240
In that year, a young player from the Shanghai Sharks entered the NBA draft and was picked

07:09.240 --> 07:12.400
first overall—Yao Ming.

07:12.400 --> 07:17.100
He quickly became a sensation and reached the NBA All-Star team eight times, but as

07:17.100 --> 07:23.020
much as he was a sensation in the US, he was just as much or more back home in China.

07:23.020 --> 07:28.300
The number of Chinese NBA fans grew exponentially with every game he played, but eventually,

07:28.300 --> 07:32.780
after a series of injury-plagued seasons, Ming retired in 2011.

07:32.780 --> 07:37.120
At the time, anyone would have assumed that this would have been the end of the NBA's

07:37.120 --> 07:40.940
rise in China, but as it turned out, this was not the case.

07:40.940 --> 07:45.320
While at first Chinese fans may have tuned in to watch Yao Ming, eventually they just

07:45.320 --> 07:47.640
tuned in to watch the NBA.

07:47.640 --> 07:52.580
In the decade following Ming's retirement, China grew into an enormous, crucial part

07:52.580 --> 07:58.260
of the NBA's business, representing more than $500 million a year in revenue.

07:58.260 --> 08:05.220
However, in October 2019, this was all threatened by one tweet containing one image.

08:05.220 --> 08:09.000
It read, fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.

08:09.000 --> 08:13.780
This was, of course, a reference in support of the widespread protests in Hong Kong—protests

08:13.780 --> 08:18.580
commonly characterized as anti-Beijing—but what's more important is who this tweet

08:18.580 --> 08:19.900
was by.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.980
Daryl Moret, the general manager of the Houston Rockets.

08:23.980 --> 08:28.880
All of a sudden, deals fell apart, relationships were severed, game broadcasts were cancelled,

08:28.880 --> 08:34.180
the NBA's China market was under threat due to a perception that the league was anti-China.

08:34.180 --> 08:39.420
Unsurprisingly for business reasons, the NBA quickly issued what was essentially an apology

08:39.420 --> 08:40.620
for this tweet.

08:40.620 --> 08:45.740
Of course, following that, the NBA both faced criticism from China for the original tweet

08:45.740 --> 08:49.260
and from the US for apologizing for that tweet.

08:49.260 --> 08:53.020
Eventually, the scandal largely blew over and relationships started to inch back to

08:53.020 --> 08:58.740
normal, but this was all indicative of a bigger issue with American sports' expansion into

08:58.740 --> 08:59.740
China.

08:59.740 --> 09:05.020
What these leagues are doing is selling one product to two very different markets.

09:05.020 --> 09:10.160
Worldwide, the entertainment industry, of which sports is a part of, has become increasingly

09:10.160 --> 09:15.300
homogenized with more and more people watching the same TV shows, listening to the same music,

09:15.300 --> 09:19.380
and going to the same movies no matter which country or culture they come from.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.020
China, meanwhile, is different.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.460
Chinese people largely watch different TV shows, listen to different music, and go to

09:26.460 --> 09:28.700
different movies than the rest of us.

09:28.700 --> 09:32.740
A lot of this is because of government censorship and import policy.

09:32.740 --> 09:37.500
For example, there's a quota allowing only a small number of foreign films into Chinese

09:37.500 --> 09:38.900
cinemas each year.

09:38.900 --> 09:42.860
Sports, though, can't be treated like the rest of entertainment.

09:42.860 --> 09:47.840
The sports entertainment experience in the 21st century stretches far beyond just the

09:47.840 --> 09:53.500
viewing of actual games—in fact, watching the games in their entirety is hardly even

09:53.500 --> 09:55.420
a requirement anymore.

09:55.420 --> 10:01.500
Sports is an all-encompassing, unscripted, uncensored entertainment experience, and this

10:01.500 --> 10:06.100
is the problem for China—it can't just edit out an unflattering aspect of sports

10:06.100 --> 10:09.220
in the same way it can with foreign films.

10:09.220 --> 10:12.960
Sports and politics in the US are intrinsically intertwined.

10:12.960 --> 10:17.580
Many athletes naturally take their place as political activists given their influence,

10:17.580 --> 10:20.700
but this is very different from in China.

10:20.700 --> 10:26.320
In China, sports is a game where athletes go and play, someone wins, and then everyone

10:26.320 --> 10:27.320
goes home.

10:27.320 --> 10:32.920
That's because, in China, entertainment and politics stay far, far away from each

10:32.920 --> 10:38.660
other—or perhaps more accurately, entertainment and opposition politics stay far, far away

10:38.660 --> 10:40.020
from each other.

10:40.020 --> 10:44.180
American sports will continue their march towards increased relevancy in China as it,

10:44.180 --> 10:47.780
as a country, has an under-saturated spectator sports market.

10:47.780 --> 10:52.620
Meanwhile, though, if these leagues become a true phenomenon in China, they'll have

10:52.620 --> 10:57.660
to make more tough calls as to whether they want to be a sports league for the US or for

10:57.660 --> 11:00.380
the world.

11:00.380 --> 11:04.180
In my opinion, the behind-the-scenes of sports is fascinating.

11:04.180 --> 11:08.660
If you agree, but feel you've gotten enough of the business side for now, you can learn

11:08.660 --> 11:11.320
a little more about the physics side.

11:11.320 --> 11:15.180
You can learn how climbers figure out how elastic their ropes should be—elastic enough

11:15.180 --> 11:18.740
to not give them whiplash when they fall, but not elastic enough to let them hit the

11:18.740 --> 11:19.740
ground.

11:19.740 --> 11:23.000
You can learn how energy transforms when a skier descends a slope, you can learn how

11:23.000 --> 11:27.800
archers account for gravity in their aim, and you can learn all of this on Brilliant.

11:27.800 --> 11:32.140
These are just some of the interesting, engaging things that you can learn about while you're

11:32.140 --> 11:37.020
actually learning classical mechanics on Brilliant—something decisively less engaging

11:37.020 --> 11:39.640
than climbing, skiing, or archery.

11:39.640 --> 11:43.420
The teaching and learning style is what makes Brilliant so effective for the kind of things

11:43.420 --> 11:47.360
that you might want to learn, but previously were too daunted, too.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.900
If your New Year's resolution was to learn more, to improve yourself, or to challenge

11:50.900 --> 11:53.980
yourself, Brilliant is the place to start.

11:53.980 --> 11:58.700
They help you achieve your goals in STEM, and, to make it easier, the first 200 people
