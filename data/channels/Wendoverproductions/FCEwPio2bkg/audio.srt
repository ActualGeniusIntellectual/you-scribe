3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,620
Twenty years ago, the western world didn't really think of China as a market.

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,660
The country was an asset for the west's own market, sure, but only for the reason

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,200
that it was a large, poor country that could act as a source of low-cost labor.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,460
Today, though, with an economy ten times larger than that of just twenty years ago, the western

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,580
world, or at least the properly informed western world, no longer thinks of China as that poor,

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,100
low-cost labor asset, but rather, as a significant, attractive market itself.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,020
Whereas in the past China made for the west, today China is the very market that the western

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,740
world focuses their attention on.

11
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:53,460
With a rapidly growing middle and upper class, businesses around the world have flooded in

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,580
to cater to China's newly wealthy in the same way that they have long served the rich

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,740
in the wealthy western world.

14
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,820
Industries ranging from hospitality to tourism to e-commerce to beauty and more are all thriving

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,340
there with both homegrown and foreign-born players establishing their spots in the Chinese

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,840
market, but one enormous industry that is still emerging and evolving in the Middle

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,060
Kingdom is that of sports.

18
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,260
Sports is a monstrous global industry, but nowhere is that industry more enormous than

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,460
in the US.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,220
The NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL represent the first, second, fourth, and six most valuable

21
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,260
sports leagues in the world and collectively bring in more than $30 billion in annual revenue.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,420
However, American sports are not purely an American industry.

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,260
Between merchandising, league partnerships, TV and streaming rights, and other revenue

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,380
streams, American sports leagues actually earn a considerable amount of money outside

25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,700
of America.

26
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,580
China is a market worth targeting for any business, but it has a particular appeal for

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,940
sports leagues.

28
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:02,320
Beyond its status as a large and relatively recently wealthy nation, China has a government

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,740
willing and interested in investing in foreign sports—the kind of foreign sports that would

30
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,780
earn them prestige in international competitions.

31
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,100
Each of the four major American sports leagues are the dominant leagues in the world for

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,340
their respective sports, so any interest in each sport will lead to interest in their

33
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,340
league.

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,420
Each league has its own strategy to grow Chinese interest both in their sport and their league.

35
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,900
Baseball is incredibly popular in nearby Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, and so there was reason

36
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,580
to believe that the sport could too become popular in China.

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,740
Despite this, though, major league baseball has demonstrated the least interest in the

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:45,100
market, and the market has demonstrated the least interest in the MLB.

39
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,920
The league's most tangible effort to attract Chinese audiences took place back in 2008

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,040
when two preseason games between the Padres and Dodgers were played in Beijing.

41
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,080
Since then, the history of baseball in China has been fraught with difficulties with their

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,580
national league, which operated in cooperation with the American MLB, suspending operations

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:11,120
in 2012, restarting in 2014, suspending operations again in 2016, then starting up again in 2019

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,020
with just four teams.

45
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,980
The MLB has also long operated three development centers where top Chinese baseball players

46
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,940
are trained, although none of the players from these centers have ever actually seen

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,580
action in the MLB itself.

48
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,940
When confined press release upon press release about different renewed efforts by the MLB

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,020
to grow the sport in China, however, all signs indicate that these have not resulted in much.

50
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,320
Evidence of this can be seen on the league's official Weibo account—one of the top social

51
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,960
networks in China—which has only 650,000 followers.

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,600
The story is not markedly different with the NHL, but the history of its efforts is shorter.

53
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:55,900
It put on exhibition matches between the Kings and Canucks in Shanghai and Beijing in 2017,

54
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,000
then between the Bruins and Flames in Beijing and Shenzhen in 2018.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,080
These games were generally well-received and were attended by healthy-sized audiences,

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,460
but there was a conspicuous lack of follow-up, with no 2019 games in China, reportedly due

57
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,880
to issues with booking arenas.

58
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
Since then, though, they've doubled down, sending Stanley Cup champion Alex Ovechkin

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,320
to the country in summer 2019 to promote the sport, opening an office in Beijing, and hiring

60
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,840
a China marketing head.

61
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,660
Unfortunately for them, though, the little attention China pays to hockey is not primarily

62
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,820
directed to the NHL.

63
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,960
The second most lucrative hockey league in the world, the Continental Hockey League,

64
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,160
added a Chinese team in 2016—the HC Kunlun Red Star.

65
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,880
The team is no phenomenon yet, with the lowest average game attendance in the league, but

66
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,160
it does mean that a Chinese hockey fan would much more likely pay attention to the KHL

67
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
over the NHL.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,640
Still, though, the NHL seems to get somewhat more respectable Chinese engagement—demonstrated

69
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,720
by their just over 1 million fans on Weibo.

70
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,440
American football, though, is where it starts to get interesting.

71
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,340
The NFL has generated a real fan base among Chinese—not a large one, but it certainly

72
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,760
exists.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,020
This is despite the fact that they are the only of the four leagues that has not played

74
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,680
a game in China.

75
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,600
There is talk of putting one on in the country at the start of the 2020 season, although,

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,580
there's been talk before without result.

77
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:26,080
The real potential for the NFL, though, comes not through in-country games, but rather through

78
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,800
digital distribution.

79
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,320
Each week, Tencent's streaming platforms broadcast a number of games which each have

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
an average viewership of more than 2 million people.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,500
That's despite the awkward broadcast times in the mid-morning, given the time difference.

82
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,120
How much the NFL was paid for these broadcast rights is not publicly known, but with those

83
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
kind of numbers, it's certainly not nothing.

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,240
Beyond the league as a whole's efforts, the New England Patriots have put a particular

85
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
level of effort into attracting Chinese fans.

86
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,020
A huge benefit for them is that their star, Tom Brady, has been learning and speaks a

87
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,180
rudimentary level of Mandarin.

88
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,020
He hosted a Chinese-language show for the team's digital channels which attracted

89
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,780
sizable attention—over 15 million total views.

90
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,900
Meanwhile, playing the sport itself is increasingly popular in China—having one's children

91
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,340
learn the American sport has emerged as a status symbol, and 120,000 young Chinese have

92
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,260
gone to private training camps for American football.

93
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,140
Still though, the NFL has a long way to go to make China a sizable portion of its business.

94
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,820
On Weibo, for example, it has only attracted slightly more fans than the NHL at 1.3 million.

95
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,920
The final of these four leagues, though, has turned China into a sizable and now crucial

96
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,180
bit of its business.

97
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,740
Basketball has been played casually in China since the late 1800s when American missionaries

98
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,700
first introduced the sport.

99
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,580
As China liberalized in the latter half of the 20th century, the NBA capitalized on this

100
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,380
and then-commissioner David Stern led an effort to get their games televised in China.

101
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,300
This attracted a moderate fanbase, but the true, pivotal moment happened in 2002.

102
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:09,240
In that year, a young player from the Shanghai Sharks entered the NBA draft and was picked

103
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,400
first overall—Yao Ming.

104
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,100
He quickly became a sensation and reached the NBA All-Star team eight times, but as

105
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:23,020
much as he was a sensation in the US, he was just as much or more back home in China.

106
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,300
The number of Chinese NBA fans grew exponentially with every game he played, but eventually,

107
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,780
after a series of injury-plagued seasons, Ming retired in 2011.

108
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,120
At the time, anyone would have assumed that this would have been the end of the NBA's

109
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,940
rise in China, but as it turned out, this was not the case.

110
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,320
While at first Chinese fans may have tuned in to watch Yao Ming, eventually they just

111
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,640
tuned in to watch the NBA.

112
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,580
In the decade following Ming's retirement, China grew into an enormous, crucial part

113
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,260
of the NBA's business, representing more than $500 million a year in revenue.

114
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:05,220
However, in October 2019, this was all threatened by one tweet containing one image.

115
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,000
It read, fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,780
This was, of course, a reference in support of the widespread protests in Hong Kong—protests

117
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,580
commonly characterized as anti-Beijing—but what's more important is who this tweet

118
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,900
was by.

119
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,980
Daryl Moret, the general manager of the Houston Rockets.

120
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,880
All of a sudden, deals fell apart, relationships were severed, game broadcasts were cancelled,

121
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,180
the NBA's China market was under threat due to a perception that the league was anti-China.

122
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,420
Unsurprisingly for business reasons, the NBA quickly issued what was essentially an apology

123
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,620
for this tweet.

124
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,740
Of course, following that, the NBA both faced criticism from China for the original tweet

125
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,260
and from the US for apologizing for that tweet.

126
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,020
Eventually, the scandal largely blew over and relationships started to inch back to

127
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,740
normal, but this was all indicative of a bigger issue with American sports' expansion into

128
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,740
China.

129
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,020
What these leagues are doing is selling one product to two very different markets.

130
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,160
Worldwide, the entertainment industry, of which sports is a part of, has become increasingly

131
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,300
homogenized with more and more people watching the same TV shows, listening to the same music,

132
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,380
and going to the same movies no matter which country or culture they come from.

133
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,020
China, meanwhile, is different.

134
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,460
Chinese people largely watch different TV shows, listen to different music, and go to

135
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,700
different movies than the rest of us.

136
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,740
A lot of this is because of government censorship and import policy.

137
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,500
For example, there's a quota allowing only a small number of foreign films into Chinese

138
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,900
cinemas each year.

139
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,860
Sports, though, can't be treated like the rest of entertainment.

140
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,840
The sports entertainment experience in the 21st century stretches far beyond just the

141
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:53,500
viewing of actual games—in fact, watching the games in their entirety is hardly even

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,420
a requirement anymore.

143
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,500
Sports is an all-encompassing, unscripted, uncensored entertainment experience, and this

144
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,100
is the problem for China—it can't just edit out an unflattering aspect of sports

145
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,220
in the same way it can with foreign films.

146
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,960
Sports and politics in the US are intrinsically intertwined.

147
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,580
Many athletes naturally take their place as political activists given their influence,

148
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,700
but this is very different from in China.

149
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,320
In China, sports is a game where athletes go and play, someone wins, and then everyone

150
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
goes home.

151
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,920
That's because, in China, entertainment and politics stay far, far away from each

152
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:38,660
other—or perhaps more accurately, entertainment and opposition politics stay far, far away

153
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,020
from each other.

154
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,180
American sports will continue their march towards increased relevancy in China as it,

155
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,780
as a country, has an under-saturated spectator sports market.

156
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,620
Meanwhile, though, if these leagues become a true phenomenon in China, they'll have

157
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,660
to make more tough calls as to whether they want to be a sports league for the US or for

158
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,380
the world.

159
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:04,180
In my opinion, the behind-the-scenes of sports is fascinating.

160
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,660
If you agree, but feel you've gotten enough of the business side for now, you can learn

161
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,320
a little more about the physics side.

162
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,180
You can learn how climbers figure out how elastic their ropes should be—elastic enough

163
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,740
to not give them whiplash when they fall, but not elastic enough to let them hit the

164
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
ground.

165
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,000
You can learn how energy transforms when a skier descends a slope, you can learn how

166
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,800
archers account for gravity in their aim, and you can learn all of this on Brilliant.

167
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,140
These are just some of the interesting, engaging things that you can learn about while you're

168
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,020
actually learning classical mechanics on Brilliant—something decisively less engaging

169
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,640
than climbing, skiing, or archery.

170
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,420
The teaching and learning style is what makes Brilliant so effective for the kind of things

171
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,360
that you might want to learn, but previously were too daunted, too.

172
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,900
If your New Year's resolution was to learn more, to improve yourself, or to challenge

173
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,980
yourself, Brilliant is the place to start.

174
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,700
They help you achieve your goals in STEM, and, to make it easier, the first 200 people

175
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:04,260
that go to brilliant.org slash Wendover will get 20% off an annual premium subscription.
