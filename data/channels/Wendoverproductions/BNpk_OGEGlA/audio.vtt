00:13.240 --> 00:16.860
Supermarkets are a marvel obscured by banality.

00:16.860 --> 00:22.520
Nearly everyone in the developed world uses them regularly, so we have no basis of comparison—we

00:22.520 --> 00:25.160
just don't know a world without supermarkets.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.200
We don't know how it was a century ago, when grocery stores took the form of small

00:30.200 --> 00:34.040
storefronts found every few blocks throughout towns and cities.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.480
You'd hand the clerk a list, indicating you wanted, among other things, apples.

00:38.480 --> 00:43.440
They'd then gather you apples—assuming they were in season and in stock.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.880
Nowadays, however, you are confronted by an aisle rivaling the size of those historic

00:47.880 --> 00:53.680
grocery stores, displaying a tantalizing, sprawling selection of honeycrisps, fujis,

00:53.680 --> 01:01.040
Granny Smiths, Galas, Braeburns, and more—all the varieties always in stock all year long.

01:01.040 --> 01:06.880
They sit next to pineapples from Costa Rica, avocados from Mexico, and mangoes from Brazil.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.120
Further on, there's beef from an entirely different hemisphere, and fish that was alive

01:11.120 --> 01:14.680
in the ocean thousands of miles away just days ago.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.820
A century ago, you could certainly buy a jar of peanut butter, but now, you can buy regular

01:19.820 --> 01:24.820
peanut butter, or chunky peanut butter, or smooth peanut butter, or organic peanut butter,

01:24.820 --> 01:26.300
and it doesn't stop there.

01:26.300 --> 01:31.460
You can get the chunky Jif brand, or the chunky Smokers brand, or the Skippy brand, the store

01:31.460 --> 01:34.700
brand, or one of so many more.

01:34.700 --> 01:39.620
You have dozens upon dozens of choices of peanut butter, dozens of choices of other

01:39.620 --> 01:45.260
nut butter, dozens of choices of other sandwich spreads, and all of that is just one part

01:45.260 --> 01:47.240
of one aisle.

01:47.240 --> 01:53.140
Put together, the stability and variety of choice in modern supermarkets is incredible.

01:53.140 --> 01:59.720
In big cities and small towns alike, American supermarkets offer an average of some 30,000

01:59.720 --> 02:05.600
different product choices, which stay in stock about 92% of the time.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.240
While the concept of the modern supermarket first appeared in the US, it's since proliferated

02:10.240 --> 02:13.280
across the entire developed world.

02:13.280 --> 02:19.100
The fact that this has become not only normal, but expected globally is the greatest indicator

02:19.100 --> 02:24.760
of the robustness of the modern global supply chain, but that's not to say that it's

02:24.760 --> 02:25.760
easy.

02:25.760 --> 02:30.520
For consumers, it's simple—we can get everything we want, any time, from a single

02:30.520 --> 02:35.720
store, but the complexity behind that is truly stunning.

02:35.720 --> 02:41.800
This is a typical American supermarket—a city market brand store in Glenwood Springs,

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
Colorado.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.760
The brand is small, it's part of the larger King Soopers brand, which itself is part of

02:47.760 --> 02:51.440
Kroger's—the largest American supermarket company.

02:51.440 --> 02:56.280
The entire American supermarket landscape is incredibly consolidated, with the top four

02:56.280 --> 03:02.100
companies holding 45% of the market, which certainly has massively negative consequences,

03:02.100 --> 03:08.460
but this market concentration has led to the huge scale and complexity of our current food

03:08.460 --> 03:09.880
supply chain.

03:09.880 --> 03:14.700
Even independent grocers now tend to rely on gigantic cooperatives to amass buying

03:14.700 --> 03:21.400
power and supply their shelves, so industry-wide, scale, and complexity is the norm.

03:21.400 --> 03:27.100
Now, supermarkets like this are involved with a perpetual balancing act—keeping items

03:27.100 --> 03:30.160
in stock is of paramount financial concern.

03:30.160 --> 03:34.320
Research into the matter has found that on the third instance of a desired item being

03:34.320 --> 03:39.700
out of stock, consumers will go to an alternate store 70% of the time.

03:39.700 --> 03:44.140
Being located just five minutes from a Walmart, this store can't afford to go out of stock

03:44.140 --> 03:49.380
of a single item, push a customer to a competitor, and lose out on thousands of dollars in annual

03:49.380 --> 03:52.580
sales because they decide they like Walmart more.

03:52.580 --> 03:57.580
Therefore, the task is to keep everything in stock, as much as possible, while having

03:57.580 --> 04:00.220
as little extra product as possible.

04:00.220 --> 04:05.420
So, the way this Glenwood Springs city market, along with essentially any grocery store,

04:05.420 --> 04:10.420
keeps those 30,000 products continuously on its shelves is simple, at least on the

04:10.420 --> 04:11.420
surface.

04:11.420 --> 04:15.500
You see, every item in a supermarket is labeled with a barcode.

04:15.500 --> 04:20.440
Usually that code is standardized industry-wide, except with some white-label products.

04:20.440 --> 04:25.300
When products arrive at the store, they are checked in to its inventory management software.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.040
From there, it's simple math.

04:27.040 --> 04:31.060
As products are checked out and paid for, they're subtracted from the inventory count,

04:31.060 --> 04:35.020
and as that count gets low, the store knows it's time to reorder.

04:35.020 --> 04:40.260
It's a straightforward concept—except when you actually implement it in the real

04:40.260 --> 04:41.260
world.

04:41.260 --> 04:47.060
There's more than one way a product can leave a store—it can get stolen, go bad,

04:47.060 --> 04:49.060
get damaged, or more.

04:49.060 --> 04:55.020
That means there's always a slight disparity between how many items there are on paper

04:55.020 --> 04:56.580
and in reality.

04:56.580 --> 04:59.920
Inventory management software can account for some of that, assuming employees feed

04:59.920 --> 05:04.840
it accurate data, but stores also conduct a manual count every month or two to determine

05:04.840 --> 05:06.740
the actual disparity.

05:06.740 --> 05:11.540
This is most important for financial reporting reasons—the retailer can't know how profitable

05:11.540 --> 05:16.660
it actually is until it knows how much product it lost, but it can also be used to tell the

05:16.660 --> 05:20.900
inventory management software how much it's typically off, and correct for that in the

05:20.900 --> 05:24.040
future to make sure reorders happen on time.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.460
Then, there are other factors.

05:26.460 --> 05:30.860
For example, if a supermarket runs a sale on a given item, that product will likely

05:30.860 --> 05:35.540
sell more, so inventory management software needs to account for that in its ordering

05:35.540 --> 05:40.100
process to make sure that it correspondingly ramps inventory up.

05:40.100 --> 05:45.620
Then, incoming unseasonably warm weather could mean that barbecue charcoal sales, for example,

05:45.620 --> 05:50.420
are about to increase, while hot chocolate sales will decrease, so more complex inventory

05:50.420 --> 05:55.020
management software can account for external factors like these and make ordering decisions

05:55.020 --> 05:56.580
based upon them.

05:56.580 --> 06:00.060
Now, some products are simple to keep in stock.

06:00.060 --> 06:04.680
Oreos, for example, have a long shelf life and come from a massive manufacturer with

06:04.680 --> 06:07.860
multiple production facilities spread out across the world.

06:07.860 --> 06:11.940
There's plenty of slack and flexibility in that system.

06:11.940 --> 06:14.740
That's not the case with all foods.

06:14.740 --> 06:17.500
Take, for example, grapes.

06:17.500 --> 06:22.260
Table grapes are quite difficult to keep in stock—if there's a sudden surge in demand

06:22.260 --> 06:25.800
for grapes, you can't just order more from the factory.

06:25.800 --> 06:30.460
Their global inventory levels are essentially decided years before, as growers decide whether

06:30.460 --> 06:33.140
to add or subtract vines from their vineyards.

06:33.140 --> 06:39.140
What's more, grapes are highly seasonal—they don't ripen off the vine, so they have to

06:39.140 --> 06:43.480
be picked exactly when they're best for eating—effectively meaning growers have

06:43.480 --> 06:48.040
a one- or two-week window to get a given vineyard harvested.

06:48.040 --> 06:53.620
Of course, grapes are found in grocery stores for far more than two weeks a year.

06:53.620 --> 06:56.000
In fact, they're almost always available.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.800
What makes that possible is a massive production cycle spanning across the entire western hemisphere.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.560
Now, the easy part of the year for the Glenwood Springs city markets to get its grapes is

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
late summer.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.720
That's because California's Central Valley, where the vast majority of the country's

07:12.720 --> 07:18.040
grapes are grown, has its natural harvest season between mid-August and late September.

07:18.040 --> 07:23.660
That's extended earlier into July by ultra-early season varieties of grapes, such as Chardra

07:23.660 --> 07:28.680
UA, and then later into November by late season varieties such as the Autumn King.

07:28.680 --> 07:33.540
Therefore, there's about a four-month window when the entire country's grape supply is

07:33.540 --> 07:36.240
largely fueled by California.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.960
Once that ends, though, things get trickier, but the industry has learned to take advantage

07:40.960 --> 07:43.000
of global climate patterns.

07:43.000 --> 07:49.120
Peru, thanks to its fairly equatorial climate, begins its harvest just when California's

07:49.120 --> 07:54.320
ends, early December, and saturates the market until mid-February when Chile, with its more

07:54.320 --> 07:56.640
seasonal climate, takes over.

07:56.640 --> 08:01.120
They essentially act as the southern hemisphere equivalent of California, also using early

08:01.120 --> 08:05.880
and late season varieties to stretch their massive harvest all the way until May.

08:05.880 --> 08:11.280
Next, California's Imperial and Coachella Valleys, as well as various locations in Mexico,

08:11.280 --> 08:13.200
fire up their harvests.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.800
These areas have year-round warm weather that allows for a year-round growing season, but

08:17.800 --> 08:22.720
time their vineyards specifically to line up with this gap in the market until mid-July

08:22.720 --> 08:27.480
when California's more seasonal Central Valley begins its harvest, starting the cycle

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
once again.

08:28.480 --> 08:33.520
While the overall path a given food product takes varies dramatically, the one constant

08:33.520 --> 08:38.800
is that every item that ends up on the Glenwood Springs City Market's shelves comes via

08:38.800 --> 08:41.840
here—the distribution center.

08:41.840 --> 08:47.000
Now, how distribution centers work on the surface level is fairly standard—they bring

08:47.000 --> 08:51.440
in pallets of a single product, break them down to the box level, and create pallets

08:51.440 --> 08:55.160
with smaller quantities of everything a store needs.

08:55.160 --> 08:59.640
How each distribution center accomplishes that, however, differs.

08:59.640 --> 09:04.920
Kroger's Aurora facility, operated by a company called Windigo Logistics, uses a fairly

09:04.920 --> 09:07.360
high degree of automation.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.080
Trucks arrive from all across North America, delivering pallets worth of product from Kroger's

09:12.080 --> 09:13.620
different vendors.

09:13.620 --> 09:18.320
For example, a truck might arrive from Nabisco's plant in Chicago carrying pallets worth of

09:18.320 --> 09:19.380
Oreos.

09:19.380 --> 09:24.300
These pallets are immediately placed on an induction conveyor belt, where a scanner determines

09:24.300 --> 09:26.360
what they actually are.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.800
Without information, the warehousing software determines whether it thinks it will need

09:29.800 --> 09:33.240
more Oreos in its system in the next three days or later.

09:33.240 --> 09:38.120
If the answer's later, the pallets will just make a quick stop at a pallet exchanger

09:38.120 --> 09:43.280
machine, which swaps each onto a fresh storage pallet before the conveyor belt takes them

09:43.280 --> 09:47.680
to an automated longer-term storage system in a separate part of the warehouse.

09:47.680 --> 09:52.000
If one pallet's worth of Oreos is needed sooner, though, it will go to a depalletizing

09:52.000 --> 09:56.620
machine, which breaks them down to the box level, each of which carries dozens of units

09:56.620 --> 09:58.360
of the actual product.

09:58.360 --> 10:02.880
Those boxes are injected into a network of conveyor belts, which takes them to a machine

10:02.880 --> 10:05.640
that places each onto an individual tray.

10:05.640 --> 10:10.400
That tray is then automatically stored somewhere in a cavernous hall of shelving—essentially

10:10.400 --> 10:12.120
a massive vending machine.

10:12.120 --> 10:16.400
Sometime in the next three days, some King Soopers or city market store will place a

10:16.400 --> 10:21.520
reorder indicating that they need Oreos, and so the warehousing software will automatically

10:22.040 --> 10:26.360
remove some trays of Oreos from the shelving and place them on another conveyor belt, which

10:26.360 --> 10:30.640
will take them to a smaller automated shelving system closer to the palletizing area, which

10:30.640 --> 10:34.600
acts as interim storage, keeping items no more than a few hours.

10:34.600 --> 10:39.540
Then, when it comes time to build an actual pallet worth of product for a given store,

10:39.540 --> 10:42.760
the trays are removed from the shelving in a specific order.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.900
You see, the system knows the composition of the shelves of each of their stores, so

10:46.900 --> 10:49.240
it knows what order to build a pallet in.

10:49.240 --> 10:54.000
They'll put items for one side of a store aisle at the bottom of a pallet, items for

10:54.000 --> 10:58.420
the middle of that aisle in the middle, and items for the other end, at the top.

10:58.420 --> 11:02.680
That way, the stockers in the store can break down a pallet and put things immediately on

11:02.680 --> 11:05.580
the shelves in the most efficient manner.

11:05.580 --> 11:10.480
At the distribution center, this palletizing process is still completely automated, and

11:10.480 --> 11:14.920
in the end, the system will deliver completed pallets to humans responsible for loading

11:14.920 --> 11:16.200
outbound trucks.

11:16.200 --> 11:21.500
Finally, once that's all completed, a truck will take the three-hour journey west to Glenwood

11:21.500 --> 11:27.080
Springs' city market, where an overnight crew restocks the shelves with fresh product.

11:27.080 --> 11:33.440
Now, even as automation is making significant inroads, plenty of grocery distribution centers

11:33.440 --> 11:36.960
still use a far more manual approach.

11:36.960 --> 11:41.900
That process is essentially the same—pallets are taken in, stored, and outbound pallets

11:41.900 --> 11:46.000
are built with smaller quantities of each product, but each step is just completed by

11:46.000 --> 11:48.260
humans instead of machines.

11:48.260 --> 11:53.140
However, both the automated and manual processes are not perfect.

11:53.140 --> 11:59.580
Specifically, they present an issue for what's referred to as slow-moving inventory.

11:59.580 --> 12:03.900
You see, grocery distribution centers are traditionally configured to work by the pallet

12:03.900 --> 12:08.900
load—it just isn't efficient to take in a smaller amount—but sometimes, products

12:08.900 --> 12:11.060
just aren't that popular.

12:11.060 --> 12:17.560
However, unpopular products are actually crucial to the business strategies of modern supermarkets.

12:17.560 --> 12:22.180
The reason why they might have dozens upon dozens of types of salsas is that some niche

12:22.180 --> 12:27.320
brand on the bottom shelf is probably at least one person's favorite.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.780
The city market in Glenwood Springs might carry that salsa, but the Walmart or Target

12:31.780 --> 12:32.900
might not.

12:32.900 --> 12:37.100
Even if one consumer can get everything else they need at one of the competitors, they're

12:37.100 --> 12:42.220
going to keep coming back to the city market because they know they can get that one niche

12:42.220 --> 12:44.920
product that they love.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.860
Supermarkets view niche, slow-moving products as key differentiators, and key to customer

12:49.860 --> 12:54.660
retention, so they're certainly willing to sell these products even at a loss.

12:54.660 --> 13:00.260
In fact, Walmart experimented with reducing its product variety by 11%, but quickly reversed

13:00.260 --> 13:05.860
course as it became clear that this ultimately had a negative impact on their bottom line—even

13:05.860 --> 13:08.780
if it simplified their distribution logistics.

13:08.780 --> 13:13.540
On the warehouse side, though, if each store that sells that niche salsa only sells a dozen

13:13.540 --> 13:18.240
of them per week, it's going to take quite a while for even the entire company to work

13:18.240 --> 13:20.580
their way through a single pallet.

13:20.580 --> 13:25.100
In the distribution center, though, a single pallet in the picking area takes the space

13:25.100 --> 13:30.260
of a single pallet, regardless of whether it's used up in a day or a month.

13:30.260 --> 13:34.660
Therefore, every additional niche product stocked increases the amount of storage space

13:34.660 --> 13:39.140
needed, and increases the overall distance that pickers have to travel to assemble an

13:39.140 --> 13:43.240
average pallet, even in the case of manual warehouses.

13:43.240 --> 13:47.800
To mitigate these effects, while still maintaining their offerings of niche products, some supermarket

13:47.800 --> 13:53.440
chains, including Kroger's and H-E-B, have set up entire, dedicated distribution centers

13:53.440 --> 13:55.820
for slow-moving inventory.

13:55.820 --> 13:59.720
By setting up these facilities, they can ship out less than box-load shipments of certain

13:59.720 --> 14:04.900
products and stock them without slowing down the process for fast-moving inventory.

14:04.900 --> 14:09.440
Of course, this process does still require a certain amount of scale to work better than

14:09.440 --> 14:10.440
the alternative.

14:10.440 --> 14:15.280
While Kroger's has set it up in densely populated areas of the US East Coast, it is

14:15.280 --> 14:19.620
yet to do so in the more sparsely populated Rockies region, home to their King Soopers

14:19.620 --> 14:21.520
and City Market brands.

14:21.520 --> 14:26.480
There just isn't enough demand in the region to justify a dedicated setup.

14:26.480 --> 14:31.920
The pure scale at which the supermarket industry operates is what has led to this level of

14:31.920 --> 14:34.240
supply chain complexity.

14:34.240 --> 14:39.200
When a single facility is responsible for distributing a sizable portion of a state's

14:39.200 --> 14:45.880
food supply, tiny, incremental efficiency improvements can lead to huge savings for

14:45.880 --> 14:46.880
companies.

14:46.880 --> 14:51.520
While such commoditization and consolidation of food supply is viewed as problematic by

14:51.520 --> 14:57.280
many people, ultimately, the average consumer just wants a wide variety of food at a low

14:57.280 --> 14:58.280
cost.

14:58.280 --> 15:04.280
That's what this system provides—any modern supply chain is molded into what leads to

15:04.280 --> 15:08.120
commercial success, and as long as people continue to view the convenience of having

15:08.120 --> 15:13.480
30,000 options of what to eat at a moment's notice as paramount, this is how the developed

15:13.480 --> 15:17.720
world will continue to get their food.

15:17.720 --> 15:21.240
So anyone who's stayed to this point in the video probably enjoys watching Wendover

15:21.240 --> 15:26.480
videos and would enjoy watching as much of them as possible, but unfortunately, the YouTube

15:26.480 --> 15:29.100
algorithm doesn't feel the same.

15:29.100 --> 15:34.440
For any channel, there's a sweet spot of video length—for us it's about 15 minutes—and

15:34.440 --> 15:39.040
whenever we do anything longer than that, the algorithm actually punishes us.

15:39.040 --> 15:43.000
We always have to cut for time, but in order to not feel like that work was for nothing,

15:43.000 --> 15:48.280
we've started to upload extended cuts of our videos, including this one, to Nebula—the

15:48.280 --> 15:53.640
streaming site home to all your favorite educational creators, founded by those same creators.

15:53.640 --> 15:58.120
In addition, their unique business model allows for big-budget projects, of which we've

15:58.120 --> 16:01.160
made plenty across HAI and Wendover.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.680
Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula makes it even better—signing up through

16:05.680 --> 16:09.920
CuriosityStream's bundle deal means you also get access to CuriosityStream, which

16:09.920 --> 16:15.280
is a fantastic streaming site that I regularly use—home to a huge selection of non-fiction

16:15.280 --> 16:20.400
TV shows and documentaries, such as this one about the barcode and how it shaped our modern

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
economy.

16:21.400 --> 16:26.080
If this video, about the supermarket industry, was interesting to you, this short documentary

16:26.080 --> 16:30.800
is a fantastic addendum diving deep into how modern retail works.

16:30.800 --> 16:35.640
Best of all, signing up for this bundle deal helps independent creators like us stay independent.

16:35.640 --> 16:41.280
It can all be had, both streaming sites, for the rather crazy price of less than $15

16:41.280 --> 16:46.360
a year with the current sale at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
