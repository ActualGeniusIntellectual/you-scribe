13240	16860	Supermarkets are a marvel obscured by banality.
16860	22520	Nearly everyone in the developed world uses them regularly, so we have no basis of comparison—we
22520	25160	just don't know a world without supermarkets.
25960	30200	We don't know how it was a century ago, when grocery stores took the form of small
30200	34040	storefronts found every few blocks throughout towns and cities.
34040	38480	You'd hand the clerk a list, indicating you wanted, among other things, apples.
38480	43440	They'd then gather you apples—assuming they were in season and in stock.
43440	47880	Nowadays, however, you are confronted by an aisle rivaling the size of those historic
47880	53680	grocery stores, displaying a tantalizing, sprawling selection of honeycrisps, fujis,
53680	61040	Granny Smiths, Galas, Braeburns, and more—all the varieties always in stock all year long.
61040	66880	They sit next to pineapples from Costa Rica, avocados from Mexico, and mangoes from Brazil.
66880	71120	Further on, there's beef from an entirely different hemisphere, and fish that was alive
71120	74680	in the ocean thousands of miles away just days ago.
74680	79820	A century ago, you could certainly buy a jar of peanut butter, but now, you can buy regular
79820	84820	peanut butter, or chunky peanut butter, or smooth peanut butter, or organic peanut butter,
84820	86300	and it doesn't stop there.
86300	91460	You can get the chunky Jif brand, or the chunky Smokers brand, or the Skippy brand, the store
91460	94700	brand, or one of so many more.
94700	99620	You have dozens upon dozens of choices of peanut butter, dozens of choices of other
99620	105260	nut butter, dozens of choices of other sandwich spreads, and all of that is just one part
105260	107240	of one aisle.
107240	113140	Put together, the stability and variety of choice in modern supermarkets is incredible.
113140	119720	In big cities and small towns alike, American supermarkets offer an average of some 30,000
119720	125600	different product choices, which stay in stock about 92% of the time.
125600	130240	While the concept of the modern supermarket first appeared in the US, it's since proliferated
130240	133280	across the entire developed world.
133280	139100	The fact that this has become not only normal, but expected globally is the greatest indicator
139100	144760	of the robustness of the modern global supply chain, but that's not to say that it's
144760	145760	easy.
145760	150520	For consumers, it's simple—we can get everything we want, any time, from a single
150520	155720	store, but the complexity behind that is truly stunning.
155720	161800	This is a typical American supermarket—a city market brand store in Glenwood Springs,
161800	162800	Colorado.
163320	167760	The brand is small, it's part of the larger King Soopers brand, which itself is part of
167760	171440	Kroger's—the largest American supermarket company.
171440	176280	The entire American supermarket landscape is incredibly consolidated, with the top four
176280	182100	companies holding 45% of the market, which certainly has massively negative consequences,
182100	188460	but this market concentration has led to the huge scale and complexity of our current food
188460	189880	supply chain.
189880	194700	Even independent grocers now tend to rely on gigantic cooperatives to amass buying
194700	201400	power and supply their shelves, so industry-wide, scale, and complexity is the norm.
201400	207100	Now, supermarkets like this are involved with a perpetual balancing act—keeping items
207100	210160	in stock is of paramount financial concern.
210160	214320	Research into the matter has found that on the third instance of a desired item being
214320	219700	out of stock, consumers will go to an alternate store 70% of the time.
219700	224140	Being located just five minutes from a Walmart, this store can't afford to go out of stock
224140	229380	of a single item, push a customer to a competitor, and lose out on thousands of dollars in annual
229380	232580	sales because they decide they like Walmart more.
232580	237580	Therefore, the task is to keep everything in stock, as much as possible, while having
237580	240220	as little extra product as possible.
240220	245420	So, the way this Glenwood Springs city market, along with essentially any grocery store,
245420	250420	keeps those 30,000 products continuously on its shelves is simple, at least on the
250420	251420	surface.
251420	255500	You see, every item in a supermarket is labeled with a barcode.
255500	260440	Usually that code is standardized industry-wide, except with some white-label products.
260440	265300	When products arrive at the store, they are checked in to its inventory management software.
265300	267040	From there, it's simple math.
267040	271060	As products are checked out and paid for, they're subtracted from the inventory count,
271060	275020	and as that count gets low, the store knows it's time to reorder.
275020	280260	It's a straightforward concept—except when you actually implement it in the real
280260	281260	world.
281260	287060	There's more than one way a product can leave a store—it can get stolen, go bad,
287060	289060	get damaged, or more.
289060	295020	That means there's always a slight disparity between how many items there are on paper
295020	296580	and in reality.
296580	299920	Inventory management software can account for some of that, assuming employees feed
299920	304840	it accurate data, but stores also conduct a manual count every month or two to determine
304840	306740	the actual disparity.
306740	311540	This is most important for financial reporting reasons—the retailer can't know how profitable
311540	316660	it actually is until it knows how much product it lost, but it can also be used to tell the
316660	320900	inventory management software how much it's typically off, and correct for that in the
320900	324040	future to make sure reorders happen on time.
324040	326460	Then, there are other factors.
326460	330860	For example, if a supermarket runs a sale on a given item, that product will likely
330860	335540	sell more, so inventory management software needs to account for that in its ordering
335540	340100	process to make sure that it correspondingly ramps inventory up.
340100	345620	Then, incoming unseasonably warm weather could mean that barbecue charcoal sales, for example,
345620	350420	are about to increase, while hot chocolate sales will decrease, so more complex inventory
350420	355020	management software can account for external factors like these and make ordering decisions
355020	356580	based upon them.
356580	360060	Now, some products are simple to keep in stock.
360060	364680	Oreos, for example, have a long shelf life and come from a massive manufacturer with
364680	367860	multiple production facilities spread out across the world.
367860	371940	There's plenty of slack and flexibility in that system.
371940	374740	That's not the case with all foods.
374740	377500	Take, for example, grapes.
377500	382260	Table grapes are quite difficult to keep in stock—if there's a sudden surge in demand
382260	385800	for grapes, you can't just order more from the factory.
385800	390460	Their global inventory levels are essentially decided years before, as growers decide whether
390460	393140	to add or subtract vines from their vineyards.
393140	399140	What's more, grapes are highly seasonal—they don't ripen off the vine, so they have to
399140	403480	be picked exactly when they're best for eating—effectively meaning growers have
403480	408040	a one- or two-week window to get a given vineyard harvested.
408040	413620	Of course, grapes are found in grocery stores for far more than two weeks a year.
413620	416000	In fact, they're almost always available.
416000	422800	What makes that possible is a massive production cycle spanning across the entire western hemisphere.
422800	427560	Now, the easy part of the year for the Glenwood Springs city markets to get its grapes is
427560	428560	late summer.
428560	432720	That's because California's Central Valley, where the vast majority of the country's
432720	438040	grapes are grown, has its natural harvest season between mid-August and late September.
438040	443660	That's extended earlier into July by ultra-early season varieties of grapes, such as Chardra
443660	448680	UA, and then later into November by late season varieties such as the Autumn King.
448680	453540	Therefore, there's about a four-month window when the entire country's grape supply is
453540	456240	largely fueled by California.
456240	460960	Once that ends, though, things get trickier, but the industry has learned to take advantage
460960	463000	of global climate patterns.
463000	469120	Peru, thanks to its fairly equatorial climate, begins its harvest just when California's
469120	474320	ends, early December, and saturates the market until mid-February when Chile, with its more
474320	476640	seasonal climate, takes over.
476640	481120	They essentially act as the southern hemisphere equivalent of California, also using early
481120	485880	and late season varieties to stretch their massive harvest all the way until May.
485880	491280	Next, California's Imperial and Coachella Valleys, as well as various locations in Mexico,
491280	493200	fire up their harvests.
493200	497800	These areas have year-round warm weather that allows for a year-round growing season, but
497800	502720	time their vineyards specifically to line up with this gap in the market until mid-July
502720	507480	when California's more seasonal Central Valley begins its harvest, starting the cycle
507480	508480	once again.
508480	513520	While the overall path a given food product takes varies dramatically, the one constant
513520	518800	is that every item that ends up on the Glenwood Springs City Market's shelves comes via
518800	521840	here—the distribution center.
521840	527000	Now, how distribution centers work on the surface level is fairly standard—they bring
527000	531440	in pallets of a single product, break them down to the box level, and create pallets
531440	535160	with smaller quantities of everything a store needs.
535160	539640	How each distribution center accomplishes that, however, differs.
539640	544920	Kroger's Aurora facility, operated by a company called Windigo Logistics, uses a fairly
544920	547360	high degree of automation.
547360	552080	Trucks arrive from all across North America, delivering pallets worth of product from Kroger's
552080	553620	different vendors.
553620	558320	For example, a truck might arrive from Nabisco's plant in Chicago carrying pallets worth of
558320	559380	Oreos.
559380	564300	These pallets are immediately placed on an induction conveyor belt, where a scanner determines
564300	566360	what they actually are.
566360	569800	Without information, the warehousing software determines whether it thinks it will need
569800	573240	more Oreos in its system in the next three days or later.
573240	578120	If the answer's later, the pallets will just make a quick stop at a pallet exchanger
578120	583280	machine, which swaps each onto a fresh storage pallet before the conveyor belt takes them
583280	587680	to an automated longer-term storage system in a separate part of the warehouse.
587680	592000	If one pallet's worth of Oreos is needed sooner, though, it will go to a depalletizing
592000	596620	machine, which breaks them down to the box level, each of which carries dozens of units
596620	598360	of the actual product.
598360	602880	Those boxes are injected into a network of conveyor belts, which takes them to a machine
602880	605640	that places each onto an individual tray.
605640	610400	That tray is then automatically stored somewhere in a cavernous hall of shelving—essentially
610400	612120	a massive vending machine.
612120	616400	Sometime in the next three days, some King Soopers or city market store will place a
616400	621520	reorder indicating that they need Oreos, and so the warehousing software will automatically
622040	626360	remove some trays of Oreos from the shelving and place them on another conveyor belt, which
626360	630640	will take them to a smaller automated shelving system closer to the palletizing area, which
630640	634600	acts as interim storage, keeping items no more than a few hours.
634600	639540	Then, when it comes time to build an actual pallet worth of product for a given store,
639540	642760	the trays are removed from the shelving in a specific order.
642760	646900	You see, the system knows the composition of the shelves of each of their stores, so
646900	649240	it knows what order to build a pallet in.
649240	654000	They'll put items for one side of a store aisle at the bottom of a pallet, items for
654000	658420	the middle of that aisle in the middle, and items for the other end, at the top.
658420	662680	That way, the stockers in the store can break down a pallet and put things immediately on
662680	665580	the shelves in the most efficient manner.
665580	670480	At the distribution center, this palletizing process is still completely automated, and
670480	674920	in the end, the system will deliver completed pallets to humans responsible for loading
674920	676200	outbound trucks.
676200	681500	Finally, once that's all completed, a truck will take the three-hour journey west to Glenwood
681500	687080	Springs' city market, where an overnight crew restocks the shelves with fresh product.
687080	693440	Now, even as automation is making significant inroads, plenty of grocery distribution centers
693440	696960	still use a far more manual approach.
696960	701900	That process is essentially the same—pallets are taken in, stored, and outbound pallets
701900	706000	are built with smaller quantities of each product, but each step is just completed by
706000	708260	humans instead of machines.
708260	713140	However, both the automated and manual processes are not perfect.
713140	719580	Specifically, they present an issue for what's referred to as slow-moving inventory.
719580	723900	You see, grocery distribution centers are traditionally configured to work by the pallet
723900	728900	load—it just isn't efficient to take in a smaller amount—but sometimes, products
728900	731060	just aren't that popular.
731060	737560	However, unpopular products are actually crucial to the business strategies of modern supermarkets.
737560	742180	The reason why they might have dozens upon dozens of types of salsas is that some niche
742180	747320	brand on the bottom shelf is probably at least one person's favorite.
747320	751780	The city market in Glenwood Springs might carry that salsa, but the Walmart or Target
751780	752900	might not.
752900	757100	Even if one consumer can get everything else they need at one of the competitors, they're
757100	762220	going to keep coming back to the city market because they know they can get that one niche
762220	764920	product that they love.
764920	769860	Supermarkets view niche, slow-moving products as key differentiators, and key to customer
769860	774660	retention, so they're certainly willing to sell these products even at a loss.
774660	780260	In fact, Walmart experimented with reducing its product variety by 11%, but quickly reversed
780260	785860	course as it became clear that this ultimately had a negative impact on their bottom line—even
785860	788780	if it simplified their distribution logistics.
788780	793540	On the warehouse side, though, if each store that sells that niche salsa only sells a dozen
793540	798240	of them per week, it's going to take quite a while for even the entire company to work
798240	800580	their way through a single pallet.
800580	805100	In the distribution center, though, a single pallet in the picking area takes the space
805100	810260	of a single pallet, regardless of whether it's used up in a day or a month.
810260	814660	Therefore, every additional niche product stocked increases the amount of storage space
814660	819140	needed, and increases the overall distance that pickers have to travel to assemble an
819140	823240	average pallet, even in the case of manual warehouses.
823240	827800	To mitigate these effects, while still maintaining their offerings of niche products, some supermarket
827800	833440	chains, including Kroger's and H-E-B, have set up entire, dedicated distribution centers
833440	835820	for slow-moving inventory.
835820	839720	By setting up these facilities, they can ship out less than box-load shipments of certain
839720	844900	products and stock them without slowing down the process for fast-moving inventory.
844900	849440	Of course, this process does still require a certain amount of scale to work better than
849440	850440	the alternative.
850440	855280	While Kroger's has set it up in densely populated areas of the US East Coast, it is
855280	859620	yet to do so in the more sparsely populated Rockies region, home to their King Soopers
859620	861520	and City Market brands.
861520	866480	There just isn't enough demand in the region to justify a dedicated setup.
866480	871920	The pure scale at which the supermarket industry operates is what has led to this level of
871920	874240	supply chain complexity.
874240	879200	When a single facility is responsible for distributing a sizable portion of a state's
879200	885880	food supply, tiny, incremental efficiency improvements can lead to huge savings for
885880	886880	companies.
886880	891520	While such commoditization and consolidation of food supply is viewed as problematic by
891520	897280	many people, ultimately, the average consumer just wants a wide variety of food at a low
897280	898280	cost.
898280	904280	That's what this system provides—any modern supply chain is molded into what leads to
904280	908120	commercial success, and as long as people continue to view the convenience of having
908120	913480	30,000 options of what to eat at a moment's notice as paramount, this is how the developed
913480	917720	world will continue to get their food.
917720	921240	So anyone who's stayed to this point in the video probably enjoys watching Wendover
921240	926480	videos and would enjoy watching as much of them as possible, but unfortunately, the YouTube
926480	929100	algorithm doesn't feel the same.
929100	934440	For any channel, there's a sweet spot of video length—for us it's about 15 minutes—and
934440	939040	whenever we do anything longer than that, the algorithm actually punishes us.
939040	943000	We always have to cut for time, but in order to not feel like that work was for nothing,
943000	948280	we've started to upload extended cuts of our videos, including this one, to Nebula—the
