4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,860
Supermarkets are a marvel obscured by banality.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,520
Nearly everyone in the developed world uses them regularly, so we have no basis of comparison—we

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,160
just don't know a world without supermarkets.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,200
We don't know how it was a century ago, when grocery stores took the form of small

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,040
storefronts found every few blocks throughout towns and cities.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,480
You'd hand the clerk a list, indicating you wanted, among other things, apples.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,440
They'd then gather you apples—assuming they were in season and in stock.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,880
Nowadays, however, you are confronted by an aisle rivaling the size of those historic

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,680
grocery stores, displaying a tantalizing, sprawling selection of honeycrisps, fujis,

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,040
Granny Smiths, Galas, Braeburns, and more—all the varieties always in stock all year long.

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,880
They sit next to pineapples from Costa Rica, avocados from Mexico, and mangoes from Brazil.

15
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,120
Further on, there's beef from an entirely different hemisphere, and fish that was alive

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,680
in the ocean thousands of miles away just days ago.

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,820
A century ago, you could certainly buy a jar of peanut butter, but now, you can buy regular

18
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,820
peanut butter, or chunky peanut butter, or smooth peanut butter, or organic peanut butter,

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,300
and it doesn't stop there.

20
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,460
You can get the chunky Jif brand, or the chunky Smokers brand, or the Skippy brand, the store

21
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,700
brand, or one of so many more.

22
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,620
You have dozens upon dozens of choices of peanut butter, dozens of choices of other

23
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:45,260
nut butter, dozens of choices of other sandwich spreads, and all of that is just one part

24
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,240
of one aisle.

25
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:53,140
Put together, the stability and variety of choice in modern supermarkets is incredible.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,720
In big cities and small towns alike, American supermarkets offer an average of some 30,000

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,600
different product choices, which stay in stock about 92% of the time.

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,240
While the concept of the modern supermarket first appeared in the US, it's since proliferated

29
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,280
across the entire developed world.

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,100
The fact that this has become not only normal, but expected globally is the greatest indicator

31
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,760
of the robustness of the modern global supply chain, but that's not to say that it's

32
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,760
easy.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,520
For consumers, it's simple—we can get everything we want, any time, from a single

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:35,720
store, but the complexity behind that is truly stunning.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,800
This is a typical American supermarket—a city market brand store in Glenwood Springs,

36
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Colorado.

37
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,760
The brand is small, it's part of the larger King Soopers brand, which itself is part of

38
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,440
Kroger's—the largest American supermarket company.

39
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,280
The entire American supermarket landscape is incredibly consolidated, with the top four

40
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,100
companies holding 45% of the market, which certainly has massively negative consequences,

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:08,460
but this market concentration has led to the huge scale and complexity of our current food

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,880
supply chain.

43
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,700
Even independent grocers now tend to rely on gigantic cooperatives to amass buying

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:21,400
power and supply their shelves, so industry-wide, scale, and complexity is the norm.

45
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,100
Now, supermarkets like this are involved with a perpetual balancing act—keeping items

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,160
in stock is of paramount financial concern.

47
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,320
Research into the matter has found that on the third instance of a desired item being

48
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,700
out of stock, consumers will go to an alternate store 70% of the time.

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,140
Being located just five minutes from a Walmart, this store can't afford to go out of stock

50
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,380
of a single item, push a customer to a competitor, and lose out on thousands of dollars in annual

51
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,580
sales because they decide they like Walmart more.

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,580
Therefore, the task is to keep everything in stock, as much as possible, while having

53
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,220
as little extra product as possible.

54
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,420
So, the way this Glenwood Springs city market, along with essentially any grocery store,

55
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,420
keeps those 30,000 products continuously on its shelves is simple, at least on the

56
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,420
surface.

57
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,500
You see, every item in a supermarket is labeled with a barcode.

58
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:20,440
Usually that code is standardized industry-wide, except with some white-label products.

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,300
When products arrive at the store, they are checked in to its inventory management software.

60
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,040
From there, it's simple math.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,060
As products are checked out and paid for, they're subtracted from the inventory count,

62
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,020
and as that count gets low, the store knows it's time to reorder.

63
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,260
It's a straightforward concept—except when you actually implement it in the real

64
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,260
world.

65
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,060
There's more than one way a product can leave a store—it can get stolen, go bad,

66
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,060
get damaged, or more.

67
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:55,020
That means there's always a slight disparity between how many items there are on paper

68
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,580
and in reality.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,920
Inventory management software can account for some of that, assuming employees feed

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,840
it accurate data, but stores also conduct a manual count every month or two to determine

71
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,740
the actual disparity.

72
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,540
This is most important for financial reporting reasons—the retailer can't know how profitable

73
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,660
it actually is until it knows how much product it lost, but it can also be used to tell the

74
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,900
inventory management software how much it's typically off, and correct for that in the

75
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,040
future to make sure reorders happen on time.

76
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,460
Then, there are other factors.

77
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,860
For example, if a supermarket runs a sale on a given item, that product will likely

78
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,540
sell more, so inventory management software needs to account for that in its ordering

79
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,100
process to make sure that it correspondingly ramps inventory up.

80
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,620
Then, incoming unseasonably warm weather could mean that barbecue charcoal sales, for example,

81
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,420
are about to increase, while hot chocolate sales will decrease, so more complex inventory

82
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:55,020
management software can account for external factors like these and make ordering decisions

83
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,580
based upon them.

84
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,060
Now, some products are simple to keep in stock.

85
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,680
Oreos, for example, have a long shelf life and come from a massive manufacturer with

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,860
multiple production facilities spread out across the world.

87
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,940
There's plenty of slack and flexibility in that system.

88
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,740
That's not the case with all foods.

89
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,500
Take, for example, grapes.

90
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,260
Table grapes are quite difficult to keep in stock—if there's a sudden surge in demand

91
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,800
for grapes, you can't just order more from the factory.

92
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,460
Their global inventory levels are essentially decided years before, as growers decide whether

93
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,140
to add or subtract vines from their vineyards.

94
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,140
What's more, grapes are highly seasonal—they don't ripen off the vine, so they have to

95
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,480
be picked exactly when they're best for eating—effectively meaning growers have

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,040
a one- or two-week window to get a given vineyard harvested.

97
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,620
Of course, grapes are found in grocery stores for far more than two weeks a year.

98
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,000
In fact, they're almost always available.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,800
What makes that possible is a massive production cycle spanning across the entire western hemisphere.

100
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,560
Now, the easy part of the year for the Glenwood Springs city markets to get its grapes is

101
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
late summer.

102
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,720
That's because California's Central Valley, where the vast majority of the country's

103
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,040
grapes are grown, has its natural harvest season between mid-August and late September.

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,660
That's extended earlier into July by ultra-early season varieties of grapes, such as Chardra

105
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:28,680
UA, and then later into November by late season varieties such as the Autumn King.

106
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,540
Therefore, there's about a four-month window when the entire country's grape supply is

107
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,240
largely fueled by California.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,960
Once that ends, though, things get trickier, but the industry has learned to take advantage

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,000
of global climate patterns.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,120
Peru, thanks to its fairly equatorial climate, begins its harvest just when California's

111
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,320
ends, early December, and saturates the market until mid-February when Chile, with its more

112
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,640
seasonal climate, takes over.

113
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,120
They essentially act as the southern hemisphere equivalent of California, also using early

114
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,880
and late season varieties to stretch their massive harvest all the way until May.

115
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Next, California's Imperial and Coachella Valleys, as well as various locations in Mexico,

116
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,200
fire up their harvests.

117
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,800
These areas have year-round warm weather that allows for a year-round growing season, but

118
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
time their vineyards specifically to line up with this gap in the market until mid-July

119
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,480
when California's more seasonal Central Valley begins its harvest, starting the cycle

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
once again.

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,520
While the overall path a given food product takes varies dramatically, the one constant

122
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,800
is that every item that ends up on the Glenwood Springs City Market's shelves comes via

123
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,840
here—the distribution center.

124
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,000
Now, how distribution centers work on the surface level is fairly standard—they bring

125
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,440
in pallets of a single product, break them down to the box level, and create pallets

126
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,160
with smaller quantities of everything a store needs.

127
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,640
How each distribution center accomplishes that, however, differs.

128
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,920
Kroger's Aurora facility, operated by a company called Windigo Logistics, uses a fairly

129
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,360
high degree of automation.

130
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,080
Trucks arrive from all across North America, delivering pallets worth of product from Kroger's

131
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,620
different vendors.

132
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,320
For example, a truck might arrive from Nabisco's plant in Chicago carrying pallets worth of

133
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,380
Oreos.

134
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,300
These pallets are immediately placed on an induction conveyor belt, where a scanner determines

135
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,360
what they actually are.

136
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,800
Without information, the warehousing software determines whether it thinks it will need

137
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,240
more Oreos in its system in the next three days or later.

138
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,120
If the answer's later, the pallets will just make a quick stop at a pallet exchanger

139
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,280
machine, which swaps each onto a fresh storage pallet before the conveyor belt takes them

140
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,680
to an automated longer-term storage system in a separate part of the warehouse.

141
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,000
If one pallet's worth of Oreos is needed sooner, though, it will go to a depalletizing

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,620
machine, which breaks them down to the box level, each of which carries dozens of units

143
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,360
of the actual product.

144
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,880
Those boxes are injected into a network of conveyor belts, which takes them to a machine

145
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,640
that places each onto an individual tray.

146
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,400
That tray is then automatically stored somewhere in a cavernous hall of shelving—essentially

147
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,120
a massive vending machine.

148
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,400
Sometime in the next three days, some King Soopers or city market store will place a

149
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,520
reorder indicating that they need Oreos, and so the warehousing software will automatically

150
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,360
remove some trays of Oreos from the shelving and place them on another conveyor belt, which

151
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,640
will take them to a smaller automated shelving system closer to the palletizing area, which

152
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,600
acts as interim storage, keeping items no more than a few hours.

153
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,540
Then, when it comes time to build an actual pallet worth of product for a given store,

154
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,760
the trays are removed from the shelving in a specific order.

155
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,900
You see, the system knows the composition of the shelves of each of their stores, so

156
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,240
it knows what order to build a pallet in.

157
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,000
They'll put items for one side of a store aisle at the bottom of a pallet, items for

158
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,420
the middle of that aisle in the middle, and items for the other end, at the top.

159
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,680
That way, the stockers in the store can break down a pallet and put things immediately on

160
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,580
the shelves in the most efficient manner.

161
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,480
At the distribution center, this palletizing process is still completely automated, and

162
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,920
in the end, the system will deliver completed pallets to humans responsible for loading

163
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,200
outbound trucks.

164
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,500
Finally, once that's all completed, a truck will take the three-hour journey west to Glenwood

165
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,080
Springs' city market, where an overnight crew restocks the shelves with fresh product.

166
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:33,440
Now, even as automation is making significant inroads, plenty of grocery distribution centers

167
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,960
still use a far more manual approach.

168
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,900
That process is essentially the same—pallets are taken in, stored, and outbound pallets

169
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,000
are built with smaller quantities of each product, but each step is just completed by

170
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,260
humans instead of machines.

171
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,140
However, both the automated and manual processes are not perfect.

172
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:59,580
Specifically, they present an issue for what's referred to as slow-moving inventory.

173
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,900
You see, grocery distribution centers are traditionally configured to work by the pallet

174
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,900
load—it just isn't efficient to take in a smaller amount—but sometimes, products

175
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,060
just aren't that popular.

176
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,560
However, unpopular products are actually crucial to the business strategies of modern supermarkets.

177
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,180
The reason why they might have dozens upon dozens of types of salsas is that some niche

178
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,320
brand on the bottom shelf is probably at least one person's favorite.

179
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,780
The city market in Glenwood Springs might carry that salsa, but the Walmart or Target

180
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,900
might not.

181
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:37,100
Even if one consumer can get everything else they need at one of the competitors, they're

182
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:42,220
going to keep coming back to the city market because they know they can get that one niche

183
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,920
product that they love.

184
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,860
Supermarkets view niche, slow-moving products as key differentiators, and key to customer

185
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,660
retention, so they're certainly willing to sell these products even at a loss.

186
00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,260
In fact, Walmart experimented with reducing its product variety by 11%, but quickly reversed

187
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,860
course as it became clear that this ultimately had a negative impact on their bottom line—even

188
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,780
if it simplified their distribution logistics.

189
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,540
On the warehouse side, though, if each store that sells that niche salsa only sells a dozen

190
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,240
of them per week, it's going to take quite a while for even the entire company to work

191
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,580
their way through a single pallet.

192
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,100
In the distribution center, though, a single pallet in the picking area takes the space

193
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,260
of a single pallet, regardless of whether it's used up in a day or a month.

194
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,660
Therefore, every additional niche product stocked increases the amount of storage space

195
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,140
needed, and increases the overall distance that pickers have to travel to assemble an

196
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,240
average pallet, even in the case of manual warehouses.

197
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,800
To mitigate these effects, while still maintaining their offerings of niche products, some supermarket

198
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:53,440
chains, including Kroger's and H-E-B, have set up entire, dedicated distribution centers

199
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,820
for slow-moving inventory.

200
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,720
By setting up these facilities, they can ship out less than box-load shipments of certain

201
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,900
products and stock them without slowing down the process for fast-moving inventory.

202
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,440
Of course, this process does still require a certain amount of scale to work better than

203
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
the alternative.

204
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,280
While Kroger's has set it up in densely populated areas of the US East Coast, it is

205
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,620
yet to do so in the more sparsely populated Rockies region, home to their King Soopers

206
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,520
and City Market brands.

207
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,480
There just isn't enough demand in the region to justify a dedicated setup.

208
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,920
The pure scale at which the supermarket industry operates is what has led to this level of

209
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
supply chain complexity.

210
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,200
When a single facility is responsible for distributing a sizable portion of a state's

211
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:45,880
food supply, tiny, incremental efficiency improvements can lead to huge savings for

212
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
companies.

213
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,520
While such commoditization and consolidation of food supply is viewed as problematic by

214
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,280
many people, ultimately, the average consumer just wants a wide variety of food at a low

215
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
cost.

216
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:04,280
That's what this system provides—any modern supply chain is molded into what leads to

217
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,120
commercial success, and as long as people continue to view the convenience of having

218
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,480
30,000 options of what to eat at a moment's notice as paramount, this is how the developed

219
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,720
world will continue to get their food.

220
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,240
So anyone who's stayed to this point in the video probably enjoys watching Wendover

221
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,480
videos and would enjoy watching as much of them as possible, but unfortunately, the YouTube

222
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,100
algorithm doesn't feel the same.

223
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,440
For any channel, there's a sweet spot of video length—for us it's about 15 minutes—and

224
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,040
whenever we do anything longer than that, the algorithm actually punishes us.

225
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,000
We always have to cut for time, but in order to not feel like that work was for nothing,

226
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,280
we've started to upload extended cuts of our videos, including this one, to Nebula—the

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:53,640
streaming site home to all your favorite educational creators, founded by those same creators.

228
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:58,120
In addition, their unique business model allows for big-budget projects, of which we've

229
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,160
made plenty across HAI and Wendover.

230
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,680
Of course, the best way to get access to Nebula makes it even better—signing up through

231
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,920
CuriosityStream's bundle deal means you also get access to CuriosityStream, which

232
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,280
is a fantastic streaming site that I regularly use—home to a huge selection of non-fiction

233
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,400
TV shows and documentaries, such as this one about the barcode and how it shaped our modern

234
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
economy.

235
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,080
If this video, about the supermarket industry, was interesting to you, this short documentary

236
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,800
is a fantastic addendum diving deep into how modern retail works.

237
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,640
Best of all, signing up for this bundle deal helps independent creators like us stay independent.

238
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,280
It can all be had, both streaming sites, for the rather crazy price of less than $15

239
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,360
a year with the current sale at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
