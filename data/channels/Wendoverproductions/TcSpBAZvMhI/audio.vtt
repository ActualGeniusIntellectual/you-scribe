00:00.000 --> 00:05.180
7 AM—the alarm rings, the president wakes, and the shades pull back to reveal an unseasonably

00:05.180 --> 00:08.180
warm Monday morning in Washington, DC.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.120
First up is a walk across the hall to the dining room, where breakfast is served by

00:11.120 --> 00:14.820
a team led by longtime executive chef Christeta Comerford.

00:14.820 --> 00:18.600
Also provided are reading materials—a packet known as the bulletin, which staffers curate

00:18.600 --> 00:23.160
to include the news that, these days, Joe Biden wants to read—both as the president

00:23.160 --> 00:24.160
and as the person.

00:24.160 --> 00:28.380
In addition to the biggest national and international stories, it's known to disproportionately

00:28.380 --> 00:30.900
include those from his home state of Delaware.

00:30.900 --> 00:34.660
But minutes later, the president walks upstairs to the White House's rarely pictured third

00:34.660 --> 00:35.660
floor.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.760
Nestled on its northeast corner is a small workout room, where he starts his days by

00:38.760 --> 00:43.820
working out with trainer Drew Conteras—one of the many returnees from the Obama administration.

00:43.820 --> 00:47.860
Quick shower, quick change, and it's 9 AM—time for the commute downstairs and across the

00:47.860 --> 00:51.900
West Colonnade to the fabled Oval Office.

00:51.940 --> 00:58.880
$755,580,000 is dedicated to running the presidency in 2023.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.140
Even excluding attributable costs borne by other areas of government, and despite sitting

01:02.140 --> 01:12.020
at its lowest in years, this figure translates to $2,070,079 a day, $86,254 an hour, or $3,593

01:12.020 --> 01:16.460
per minute, meaning spread out evenly, before the president even arrives for work, the American

01:16.460 --> 01:21.040
taxpayer has paid three quarters of a million dollars for the job that day.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.880
One eye-popping sum, but one that could be worth it depending on what happens with the

01:24.880 --> 01:26.500
rest of the day.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.760
The most crucial role of the president is as the go-to when big decisions need to happen

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
quickly.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.880
Therefore, they have to be informed on just about anything that could boil over and reach

01:35.880 --> 01:36.880
their desk.

01:36.880 --> 01:41.120
That's why almost every day starts with the most important regular meeting—the daily

01:41.120 --> 01:42.120
briefing.

01:42.120 --> 01:47.080
On this Monday, the 13th of February, 2023, that starts exactly at 9 AM, and considering

01:47.080 --> 01:51.000
she might need to stand in for Biden at moment's notice, Vice President Kamala Harris was all

01:51.000 --> 01:55.000
also included, having made the far longer commute down from her residence at the Naval

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Observatory.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.320
The central document of these meetings is prepared by the major American intelligence

01:59.320 --> 02:02.720
agencies, summarizing what they think the president should know, and so it's been

02:02.720 --> 02:08.000
described as the quote, most highly-sensitized classified document in the government.

02:08.000 --> 02:12.040
Clearly then, there is zero chance the public can legally view any from any time recently,

02:12.040 --> 02:18.400
but the CIA did declassify some—the most recent of which from January 20, 1977, the

02:18.400 --> 02:20.360
final day of the Ford administration.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.680
It starts with a summary of protests against rising food prices in Egypt and the dramatic

02:24.680 --> 02:27.960
effect it was having on President Anwar Sadat's popularity.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.640
This intelligence proved accurate—he was assassinated four years later.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.460
Next is coverage of stalling peace talks on Cyprus, a still-classified section about West

02:35.460 --> 02:39.740
Germany and France, news about an upcoming trip by Soviet leader Podgorny to India, stalled

02:39.740 --> 02:44.040
price negotiations within OPEC, a trip cut short by Yugoslavia's president, and finally

02:44.040 --> 02:46.720
a status update on tensions in Benin.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.080
The report's short, the point's brief, but that's the point—the president's

02:50.080 --> 02:53.120
supposed to be the generalist, not the specialist.

02:53.120 --> 02:56.740
Next Biden meets with his brand new chief of staff, Jeff Zients.

02:56.740 --> 03:00.580
This role is tough to define because it's so all-encompassing, but at the simplest level,

03:00.580 --> 03:04.200
the chief of staff is essentially the manager of the White House—they deal with coordinating

03:04.200 --> 03:08.360
all the operations of the president and their office, even extending to developing policy,

03:08.360 --> 03:11.880
and therefore it tends to be one of the most powerful positions in perhaps the most powerful

03:11.880 --> 03:15.800
nation on earth, and yet its holder is rarely well-known outside Washington.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.760
But quickly, a minor crisis.

03:18.760 --> 03:22.000
Mayor of the House Kevin McCarthy tweets that he's lost confidence in architect of

03:22.000 --> 03:24.100
the capital, Brett Blanton.

03:24.100 --> 03:28.840
This is an even less-known position leading the agency that runs the Capital Complex—therefore,

03:28.840 --> 03:33.440
responsible for some 2,500 employees and an $800 million annual budget.

03:33.440 --> 03:37.280
But Blanton was facing mounting pressure as a recent Inspector General report highlighted

03:37.280 --> 03:42.720
a series of missteps—he had accrued 19,000 miles or 30,000 kilometers of prohibited personal

03:42.720 --> 03:46.640
use on his government-issued vehicle, even driving it to Florida on vacation, costing

03:46.640 --> 03:51.160
the taxpayer an estimated $12,500 in additional wear and tear.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.440
He also outfitted the vehicle with lights and sirens, misrepresenting himself as a law

03:54.440 --> 03:57.920
enforcement officer, invited friends in for so-called Patriot Tours while the capital

03:57.920 --> 04:02.000
was closed to visitors early in the pandemic, and allegedly did not even show up to work

04:02.000 --> 04:08.120
on January 6, 2021, as the building he oversaw was invaded by a mob of election-denying rioters.

04:08.120 --> 04:12.100
McCarthy was the most powerful voice asking for Blanton's removal yet, and having done

04:12.100 --> 04:16.120
so in such a public manner, it was time for Biden to act.

04:16.120 --> 04:20.440
Now, we don't know the exact details of how this particular decision was made because

04:20.440 --> 04:24.120
the minute-by-minute details of a President's day, at least within the White House, are

04:24.120 --> 04:26.280
not a matter of public record.

04:26.280 --> 04:29.300
We get what's called the public schedule, but that only includes what the White House

04:29.300 --> 04:33.320
wants us to know about—usually events open to the public or press.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.800
Mondays include few of those.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.700
They tend to be fairly boring—nobody really schedules events on the first day of the work

04:38.700 --> 04:43.360
week, so no matter the administration, archives of public schedules indicate that, unless

04:43.360 --> 04:47.520
scheduling, Mondays overwhelmingly focus on the kind of internal policy and planning work

04:47.520 --> 04:52.200
that we, the public, don't get to know the details of—at least not for a while.

04:52.200 --> 04:57.040
You see, the White House Office of Appointments and Scheduling does keep track, and like most

04:57.040 --> 05:01.060
non-classified government documents, eventually the public can get access through the rights

05:01.060 --> 05:03.080
granted by the Freedom of Information Act.

05:03.080 --> 05:07.480
Still, there's a FOIA exemption restricting access to presidential records for five years,

05:07.480 --> 05:11.800
then there are months or years of processing time on top of this, so the most recent minute-by-minute

05:11.800 --> 05:16.180
understanding we have of a president's day dates back to the Bush administration.

05:16.180 --> 05:20.480
On a similar boring Monday in February, Bush, a notoriously early riser, arrived at the

05:20.480 --> 05:24.600
Oval Office by 658 and immediately jumped into a series of meetings with his inner circle

05:24.600 --> 05:27.080
before his 8 AM daily briefing.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.400
After was another quick huddle before loading onto Marine One for a quick flight over the

05:30.400 --> 05:35.100
river to Mount Vernon, for a ceremony commemorating the 275th birthday of George Washington, and

05:35.100 --> 05:39.220
then the president was back at the Oval Office just 75 minutes after stepping out.

05:39.220 --> 05:43.080
The rest of the day was a continued cascade of calls and conversations, the most exciting

05:43.080 --> 05:46.980
of which a 90-minute conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, potentially in relation

05:46.980 --> 05:50.740
to the day's announcement that the country would send additional troops to Iraq.

05:50.740 --> 05:55.420
Finally, the Monday wrapped with a small event—a screening of the movie Amazing Grace to Commemorate

05:55.420 --> 05:58.860
Black History Month—before the president finished with dinner in the diplomatic reception

05:58.860 --> 06:01.340
room at 637 PM.

06:01.340 --> 06:07.200
February 13th, 2023 likely looked rather similar for Biden—just a succession of short, unscheduled

06:07.200 --> 06:10.720
meetings with key administration officials, largely in preparation for the rest of the

06:10.720 --> 06:15.600
week, with the exception of making a decision on what to do with the architect of the Capitol.

06:15.600 --> 06:21.360
That clearly happens quickly because, by 3 PM, it's announced—Biden fires Blanton.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.520
Finally, the last task the public knows about is a 4-30 call to Colonel Paris D. Davis,

06:26.520 --> 06:30.360
informing him that, after decades of waiting, he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for

06:30.360 --> 06:32.280
heroism in the Vietnam War.

06:32.280 --> 06:36.700
As usual, the president returned to his residence by 7 PM, finishing the day with dinner and

06:36.700 --> 06:40.320
a read of a collection of ten letters his staff selected out of the countless more sent

06:40.320 --> 06:45.240
to him by the general public—an unexceptional finish to an unexceptional Monday.

06:45.240 --> 06:49.180
The rest of the week, however, would lead up to perhaps the most exceptional day of

06:49.180 --> 06:52.580
his presidency—Tuesday, slightly busier.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.300
It begins with a daily briefing and a call to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to

06:56.300 --> 07:00.460
celebrate the day's announcement that flag carrier Air India would purchase over 200

07:00.460 --> 07:02.700
American-made Boeing aircraft.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.860
Elsewhere in the West Wing, press slowly amble in.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.580
The White House originally told them to arrive at 7 AM, but in the early hours of the morning

07:09.580 --> 07:11.380
their call time was pushed to 930.

07:11.380 --> 07:15.620
While we can only speculate, perhaps the administration wanted them on hand when the months of inflation

07:15.620 --> 07:19.900
report released at 830, but then decided it unnecessary after a tip-off that the numbers

07:19.900 --> 07:22.500
would prove rather negative for the president.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.700
Inflation wasn't slowing as fast as they'd hoped, so there was no reason to amplify the

07:25.700 --> 07:28.580
news with a surprise presidential statement, for example.

07:28.580 --> 07:32.340
But there was still plenty for the press that day, and considering the demand for access

07:32.340 --> 07:36.580
to one of the most powerful people on earth, there's quite a system to manage newsmaking

07:36.580 --> 07:37.860
at the White House.

07:37.860 --> 07:42.300
Three main areas are dedicated to the press—the briefing room, the press corps offices behind,

07:42.300 --> 07:44.100
and the so-called Pebble Beach.

07:44.100 --> 07:47.340
This is a section of the North Lawn where about two dozen television networks have a

07:47.340 --> 07:49.580
near-permanent setup for live shots.

07:49.580 --> 07:52.920
If you've seen a report from the building, it was probably filmed here as the White House

07:52.920 --> 07:57.860
essentially requires it—no longer allowing crews to trample the lawn as they did in decades

07:57.860 --> 07:58.860
before.

07:58.860 --> 08:03.100
Now, these journalists are collectively represented by the White House Correspondents Association.

08:03.100 --> 08:08.380
While they have no codified rights, by tradition, and in recognition of their power in shaping

08:08.380 --> 08:12.560
the public image of a president, the White House awards the association the role of managing

08:12.560 --> 08:14.640
press access to the facility.

08:14.640 --> 08:18.920
But considering there are thousands of association members, decisions need to be made as to who

08:18.920 --> 08:23.180
gets access to what based on the practical limitations of space and time.

08:23.180 --> 08:27.260
For example, it would be entirely impractical for the entire press corps to travel with

08:27.260 --> 08:31.940
the president at all times, but some of the press needs to be with the president at all

08:31.940 --> 08:32.940
times.

08:32.940 --> 08:36.420
If not, we would not have as confident an understanding about how unexpected events

08:36.420 --> 08:41.300
like 9-11 or the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan played out from Bush or Reagan's

08:41.300 --> 08:42.300
perspectives.

08:42.300 --> 08:47.420
So, each day, top association members take turns to compose a smaller, 13-person press

08:47.420 --> 08:51.560
pool—typically composed of a collection of a few wire reporters and photographers,

08:51.560 --> 08:55.880
a TV correspondent and crew, a radio reporter, and a print journalist.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.760
The wire reporters and photographers provide content for their subscribers, which, in the

08:59.760 --> 09:04.040
case of AP and Reuters, is essentially every news organization, while the print journalist

09:04.040 --> 09:08.200
is tasked with writing pool reports for the day, which instantly go out to a massive email

09:08.200 --> 09:09.200
list.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.200
Tuesday's designated pool reporter was Shireesh Dateh from the Huffington Post, who first

09:13.200 --> 09:17.080
informed everyone that the pool was in their vans at 1226, waiting to roll out in their

09:17.080 --> 09:19.040
motorcade with the president.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.180
Weights and vans are a constant for the press pool, as motorcades assemble long before a

09:23.180 --> 09:27.020
president is ready to depart, and today's totaled almost an hour as the next report

09:27.020 --> 09:31.060
indicated the president walked into his limo at 1 21 PM.

09:31.060 --> 09:34.600
With the knowledge of their departure, anyone at the destination knows to get ready if they

09:34.600 --> 09:36.900
want to film the motorcade's arrival.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.420
Further reports circulate who's writing with the president, who he took photos with,

09:40.420 --> 09:44.220
and then a two-minute warning informing recipients to get ready for Biden's remarks—be it

09:44.220 --> 09:47.640
a reporter watching back at the White House briefing room, or a TV director waiting to

09:47.640 --> 09:49.960
cut to a live shot of the speech.

09:49.960 --> 09:53.440
Eventually the moment the speech ends, another report goes out summarizing it, including

09:53.440 --> 09:56.440
one of the most crucial elements—color.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.520
The rest of the press corps can watch the speech from the White House or online, getting

09:59.520 --> 10:03.560
an idea of its content, but it's tougher to interpret more subjective things like audience

10:03.560 --> 10:04.560
reaction.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.200
That's why reports often include notes on this, like the strong response to Biden's

10:08.200 --> 10:11.280
remarks against assault rifles and high-volume magazines.

10:11.280 --> 10:14.720
The corps even gets information on Biden's outfits, like this note that he was wearing

10:14.720 --> 10:19.480
his trademark aviator sunglasses stepping out of his limo upon return to the White House.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.600
But quickly, the travel pool scrambles to the West Wing as the day's briefing is about

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
to start.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.640
Now, given the question and answer format, where reporters sit matters—the further

10:29.640 --> 10:32.200
forward, the more likely they'll get called on.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.440
The front seats also give a better shot talking to the broadcast cameras at the back.

10:36.440 --> 10:40.320
Even just getting a seat at all is a big deal in that it guarantees access to the room even

10:40.320 --> 10:44.000
on the busiest days, and bestows the right to use the offices to the rear.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.840
That's why the Correspondents' Association has to decide who most deserves one, and therefore

10:48.840 --> 10:53.440
the seating chart essentially acts as a year-by-year ranking of the prominence of various media

10:53.440 --> 10:54.440
organizations.

10:54.440 --> 11:00.000
In 2008, city papers like the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, and Houston Chronicle took up seats

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
in the rear.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.880
As the economics of print grew more challenging, and therefore budgets increasingly excluded

11:04.880 --> 11:08.520
a White House correspondent, these seats started to get filled by digital outlets like the

11:08.520 --> 11:10.120
Daily Beast or BuzzFeed.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.340
Today's chart includes more outlets than ever as publications have begun the practice

11:14.340 --> 11:17.120
of splitting seats, allowing them to trade off days.

11:17.120 --> 11:21.440
But the prime seats in the first and second rows have stayed consistent through the years,

11:21.440 --> 11:27.680
still fully dedicated to legacy media organizations like CBS, the AP, ABC, and NPR.

11:27.680 --> 11:32.280
Shortly after the briefing concludes, the pool reporter calls a lit—essentially,

11:32.280 --> 11:35.680
communicating that the White House has no more planned public appearances by the President

11:35.680 --> 11:39.680
or their representatives that day, and therefore that reporters can head to the office or home

11:39.680 --> 11:41.240
without worry.

11:41.240 --> 11:44.680
Wednesday was more of the same—internal work, a trip to Maryland for a speech on the

11:44.680 --> 11:47.800
economy—than an early 3.50pm lid.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.400
Thursday, a little more.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.720
At 9am, the President boards Marine One for a short 13-minute flight to Maryland's Walter

11:53.720 --> 11:56.500
Reed Medical Center for his annual physical.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.720
According to a letter released later that day, Biden was recovering well from his COVID

11:59.720 --> 12:04.640
infection in 2022, had occasional issues with gastroesophageal reflux, exhibited a notably

12:04.640 --> 12:08.840
stiffened gait compared to before his foot fracture in 2020, and had a few other minor

12:08.840 --> 12:13.800
issues but in all was a quote, healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully

12:13.800 --> 12:16.260
execute the duties of the presidency.

12:16.260 --> 12:20.320
The President returns to the White House at 1226, and quickly after, a pool report goes

12:20.320 --> 12:24.340
out informing the press that finally, after days of pressure, he would address the spate

12:24.340 --> 12:28.480
of recent shootdowns of unidentified aerial objects above the US.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.840
Once that was done, at 515 the President delivers remarks to open a screening of the movie Till

12:32.840 --> 12:36.920
in the White House's theater in commemoration of Black History Month, and with that, a lid

12:36.920 --> 12:41.560
was called at 530, finishing a relatively busy day leading up to an incredibly busy

12:41.560 --> 12:42.560
weekend.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.840
By Friday, February 17th, the week was winding down.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.760
Without any public availability on the docket for the day, any news coming from the President's

12:50.760 --> 12:53.160
office came in the form of press releases.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.680
Then, at 3.18 in the afternoon, a press lid.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.640
Oddly, though, for a light day and a weekend without work travel, the Bidens decide to

13:00.640 --> 13:04.960
stay in DC, rather than making their regular weekend retreat to Delaware.

13:04.960 --> 13:09.000
In retrospect, though, we know it was due to a quiet meeting, held sometime during the

13:09.000 --> 13:13.440
Saturday, where advisors and Biden decided to add an unannounced, perilous stop to his

13:13.440 --> 13:15.040
scheduled trip.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.920
Despite an impending departure, the Bidens made the most of their Saturday in the city.

13:18.920 --> 13:23.640
The two attend mass at Georgetown, then take in the National Museum of American History.

13:23.640 --> 13:27.400
Closing the night, they head to dinner at the Red Hen, a trendy restaurant in a trendy

13:27.400 --> 13:30.720
area, but the image effect they might have hoped for was overshadowed by the internet

13:30.720 --> 13:33.560
debate they set off by both ordering the same dish.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.080
By 8 PM, they're back at the White House.

13:36.080 --> 13:39.760
For the President, though, the night had just begun.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.220
It's 3.30 AM.

13:42.220 --> 13:46.320
Without any notice or fanfare, a motorcade quietly rolls out of the White House, turning

13:46.320 --> 13:50.840
what had been a rather standard week into a truly unprecedented one.

13:50.840 --> 13:54.560
Normally, when the President heads to Joint Base Andrews to board Air Force One, they

13:54.560 --> 13:55.800
do so by helicopter.

13:55.800 --> 14:01.280
It's safer, it's quicker, and it's less disruptive to motorcade-fatigued DC residents.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.840
But Biden's not supposed to be traveling—he's supposed to be sound asleep in the residence

14:04.840 --> 14:10.440
and a fleet of five Marine One helicopters over downtown DC just sticks out.

14:10.440 --> 14:12.920
Within an hour, the President's airborne.

14:12.920 --> 14:17.640
Accompanying him is an unusually small traveling party composed of three aides and advisors,

14:17.640 --> 14:21.520
a security detail, a medical team, and just two journalists.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.320
Not only is the press pool for the trip unusually small, with only the Wall Street Journal's

14:25.320 --> 14:29.980
Sabrina Siddiqui and the AP's Evan Vucci aboard, the reporting's also on delay as

14:29.980 --> 14:32.820
each handed over their cell phones upon arrival.

14:32.820 --> 14:35.260
Still abnormal, there is some precedent here.

14:35.260 --> 14:40.460
For the sake of image and morale, Presidents have often made trips to active war zones.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.060
Typically these are kept under wraps.

14:42.060 --> 14:46.640
The planning of President Trump's 2019 trip to Afghanistan, for instance, was so quiet

14:46.640 --> 14:51.220
that when he left Mar-a-Lago, some of his Secret Service thought he was still on premise.

14:51.220 --> 14:55.560
On President Trump's trip too, only a precious few knew of his departure, press members'

14:55.560 --> 14:58.860
forfeited phones, and plane windows were blacked out.

14:58.860 --> 15:03.120
Until Biden, though, no American President had visited an active conflict without an

15:03.120 --> 15:06.840
American troop presence, or even a safe airbase to land at.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.800
Slipping into war-torn Ukraine without the presence of the planet's most powerful fighting

15:10.800 --> 15:14.720
force, without direct American air support, vehicles, or troops providing security is

15:14.720 --> 15:18.960
an extreme risk, but a risk deemed by the President as worth it, and a risk deemed by

15:18.960 --> 15:23.540
his security personnel, best minimized by speed and secrecy rather than largess and

15:23.540 --> 15:25.120
brute force.

15:25.140 --> 15:28.820
This cloak-and-dagger planning extended to what plane the President and traveling party

15:28.820 --> 15:30.140
flies to.

15:30.140 --> 15:33.860
Normally Air Force One, the callsign reserved for whatever's flying the President, is

15:33.860 --> 15:37.620
assigned to one of these easily distinguishable VC-25s.

15:37.620 --> 15:42.040
But because these are exclusively used by the President, they're anything but stealthy.

15:42.040 --> 15:46.660
In fact, it was a photo of an airborne VC-25 by a British plane spotter that tipped off

15:46.660 --> 15:49.420
Trump's secret trip to the Middle East in 2019.

15:49.420 --> 15:54.460
Learning from this slip-up, Biden and team boarded a C-32 for its relative anonymity.

15:54.480 --> 15:59.320
Unlike the VC-25, if a C-32 is spotted, it could just as well be the First Lady, the

15:59.320 --> 16:03.480
Vice President, or a cabinet member—not necessarily the President, as these often

16:03.480 --> 16:06.440
carry a host of high-ranking officials.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.840
And it was spotted.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.800
Not long after the C-32 took off from Joint Base Andrews and pointed towards Ramstein

16:11.800 --> 16:14.680
Air Base, this tweet surfaced.

16:14.680 --> 16:19.320
Inocuous enough, using Flightradar24 and publicly available transponder data, the tweet had

16:19.320 --> 16:22.520
identified an irregularity—an oddity.

16:22.540 --> 16:25.700
And now, oddities were beginning to stack.

16:25.700 --> 16:29.240
After the trip to Poland was announced, press members had asked whether the President would

16:29.240 --> 16:30.900
be visiting Ukraine.

16:30.900 --> 16:35.420
Biden had, after all, visited Poland just 11 months earlier, and such a quick return

16:35.420 --> 16:37.140
seemed suspicious.

16:37.140 --> 16:41.640
And zeroing in further, the Twitter user who had spotted the C-32 initially had now dug

16:41.640 --> 16:46.320
deeper and posited that it very well could be President Biden aboard the flight.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.860
For their part, though, the President and company weren't waiting for the rest of

16:49.860 --> 16:52.120
the world to catch on.

16:52.120 --> 16:57.380
Having landed here at 8 PM, a stealth motorcade whisked the President to Przemysl-Gulny train

16:57.380 --> 16:58.380
station.

16:58.380 --> 17:02.300
While the Ukrainian train's interior lent it an air of stateliness fit for the office,

17:02.300 --> 17:06.200
these were not cars overhauled by Biden's team for Biden.

17:06.200 --> 17:10.740
It was simply a renovated luxury tourist train, now repurposed to sneak world leaders in and

17:10.740 --> 17:12.200
out of the country.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.980
Of all the high-risk maneuvers undertaken on this trip, it's likely that this is the

17:15.980 --> 17:20.620
most dangerous of all, as the idea of an unarmored train passing eastward, ever nearer to the

17:20.620 --> 17:26.180
front lines, left American intelligence navigating a minefield of uncontrollable variables.

17:26.180 --> 17:30.280
In the weeks and months prior, this discomfort was made evident as White House planners pushed

17:30.280 --> 17:34.080
for safer, more predictable alternatives, like Biden and Zelensky meeting somewhere

17:34.080 --> 17:38.200
along the border or in the western city of Lviv, farther from active conflict and nearer

17:38.200 --> 17:39.600
to potential intervention.

17:39.600 --> 17:44.600
While the exact security detail and contingency planning is still unknown, we do know that

17:44.600 --> 17:48.440
the White House did communicate the trip to Russia ahead of time, and that three separate

17:48.440 --> 17:53.580
American surveillance aircraft tightly looped overhead as the President crossed the border.

17:53.580 --> 18:00.300
Sunday is now Monday, as the 10-hour, 400-mile, 650-kilometer journey comes to an end in Kiev.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.740
After a briefing to refresh the President on the city's history, Biden steps aboard

18:03.740 --> 18:06.580
a modified white Toyota Land Cruiser.

18:06.580 --> 18:11.360
What was a secret is no more, as streets across the heart of Kiev close to traffic and speculation

18:11.360 --> 18:13.100
hits fever pitch.

18:13.100 --> 18:17.980
Some 30 hours since his last sighting by the press, and after 24 hours of travel, the President

18:17.980 --> 18:24.460
pops up nearly 5,000 miles or 8,000 kilometers away from the White House—all for this.

18:24.460 --> 18:28.560
A public embrace of President Zelensky, a statement, a laying of a wreath at the wall

18:28.560 --> 18:32.040
of remembrance, and a quick stop at the US Embassy.

18:32.040 --> 18:36.080
Within five hours, he's already back on the train, heading towards the border, reading

18:36.080 --> 18:38.920
briefs, and preparing for tomorrow.

18:38.920 --> 18:42.360
Before even completing a trip that will be remembered in history books centuries on,

18:42.360 --> 18:47.840
it's already on to the next task—more motorcades, more meetings, and more handshakes.

18:48.840 --> 18:53.260
The executive branch understands the power of minor, yet regular, action.

18:53.260 --> 18:57.540
Each day in their daily briefing, the President learns a small amount about an ongoing issue,

18:57.540 --> 19:01.300
and as that sums up over the days, weeks, and months, they become one of the most informed

19:01.300 --> 19:04.000
people in the world on that subject.

19:04.000 --> 19:07.920
Our sponsor Brilliant uses the same principles to unlock the ability for anyone to learn

19:07.920 --> 19:10.660
some of the most daunting subjects out there.

19:10.660 --> 19:14.020
Learning complex subjects is actually rather straightforward—you just have to break them

19:14.020 --> 19:18.540
down into smaller chunks that you can understand, and Brilliant does that for you.

19:18.540 --> 19:22.240
With their clear explanations and interactive challenges, you learn the chunks, then they

19:22.240 --> 19:24.780
build them back up into the broader subject.

19:24.780 --> 19:28.560
And on top of making it easier to learn these subjects, this structure allows you to learn

19:28.560 --> 19:32.720
as fast or slow as you want—the chunks are small enough that you can learn a component

19:32.720 --> 19:36.300
of gravitational physics, for example, just as you're waiting for a meeting or class

19:36.300 --> 19:37.300
to start.

19:37.300 --> 19:41.600
Then, if you do that enough, eventually you have a confident grasp of subjects that incredibly

19:41.600 --> 19:43.000
few others do.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.360
I think my favorite courses are the two on logic, because it's just such a fascinating

19:47.360 --> 19:51.140
subject, but they have others on mathematical thinking, statistics, computer science, and

19:51.140 --> 19:54.180
most of the complicated STEM subjects that you'd want to tackle.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.740
I can't recommend them enough, and I feel incredibly grateful that I get to promote

19:57.740 --> 20:01.240
such a worthwhile service to pay for these videos, and you can actually try everything
