0	5180	7 AM—the alarm rings, the president wakes, and the shades pull back to reveal an unseasonably
5180	8180	warm Monday morning in Washington, DC.
8180	11120	First up is a walk across the hall to the dining room, where breakfast is served by
11120	14820	a team led by longtime executive chef Christeta Comerford.
14820	18600	Also provided are reading materials—a packet known as the bulletin, which staffers curate
18600	23160	to include the news that, these days, Joe Biden wants to read—both as the president
23160	24160	and as the person.
24160	28380	In addition to the biggest national and international stories, it's known to disproportionately
28380	30900	include those from his home state of Delaware.
30900	34660	But minutes later, the president walks upstairs to the White House's rarely pictured third
34660	35660	floor.
35660	38760	Nestled on its northeast corner is a small workout room, where he starts his days by
38760	43820	working out with trainer Drew Conteras—one of the many returnees from the Obama administration.
43820	47860	Quick shower, quick change, and it's 9 AM—time for the commute downstairs and across the
47860	51900	West Colonnade to the fabled Oval Office.
51940	58880	$755,580,000 is dedicated to running the presidency in 2023.
58880	62140	Even excluding attributable costs borne by other areas of government, and despite sitting
62140	72020	at its lowest in years, this figure translates to $2,070,079 a day, $86,254 an hour, or $3,593
72020	76460	per minute, meaning spread out evenly, before the president even arrives for work, the American
76460	81040	taxpayer has paid three quarters of a million dollars for the job that day.
81040	84880	One eye-popping sum, but one that could be worth it depending on what happens with the
84880	86500	rest of the day.
86500	90760	The most crucial role of the president is as the go-to when big decisions need to happen
90760	91760	quickly.
91760	95880	Therefore, they have to be informed on just about anything that could boil over and reach
95880	96880	their desk.
96880	101120	That's why almost every day starts with the most important regular meeting—the daily
101120	102120	briefing.
102120	107080	On this Monday, the 13th of February, 2023, that starts exactly at 9 AM, and considering
107080	111000	she might need to stand in for Biden at moment's notice, Vice President Kamala Harris was all
111000	115000	also included, having made the far longer commute down from her residence at the Naval
115000	116000	Observatory.
116000	119320	The central document of these meetings is prepared by the major American intelligence
119320	122720	agencies, summarizing what they think the president should know, and so it's been
122720	128000	described as the quote, most highly-sensitized classified document in the government.
128000	132040	Clearly then, there is zero chance the public can legally view any from any time recently,
132040	138400	but the CIA did declassify some—the most recent of which from January 20, 1977, the
138400	140360	final day of the Ford administration.
140720	144680	It starts with a summary of protests against rising food prices in Egypt and the dramatic
144680	147960	effect it was having on President Anwar Sadat's popularity.
147960	151640	This intelligence proved accurate—he was assassinated four years later.
151640	155460	Next is coverage of stalling peace talks on Cyprus, a still-classified section about West
155460	159740	Germany and France, news about an upcoming trip by Soviet leader Podgorny to India, stalled
159740	164040	price negotiations within OPEC, a trip cut short by Yugoslavia's president, and finally
164040	166720	a status update on tensions in Benin.
166720	170080	The report's short, the point's brief, but that's the point—the president's
170080	173120	supposed to be the generalist, not the specialist.
173120	176740	Next Biden meets with his brand new chief of staff, Jeff Zients.
176740	180580	This role is tough to define because it's so all-encompassing, but at the simplest level,
180580	184200	the chief of staff is essentially the manager of the White House—they deal with coordinating
184200	188360	all the operations of the president and their office, even extending to developing policy,
188360	191880	and therefore it tends to be one of the most powerful positions in perhaps the most powerful
191880	195800	nation on earth, and yet its holder is rarely well-known outside Washington.
195800	198760	But quickly, a minor crisis.
198760	202000	Mayor of the House Kevin McCarthy tweets that he's lost confidence in architect of
202000	204100	the capital, Brett Blanton.
204100	208840	This is an even less-known position leading the agency that runs the Capital Complex—therefore,
208840	213440	responsible for some 2,500 employees and an $800 million annual budget.
213440	217280	But Blanton was facing mounting pressure as a recent Inspector General report highlighted
217280	222720	a series of missteps—he had accrued 19,000 miles or 30,000 kilometers of prohibited personal
222720	226640	use on his government-issued vehicle, even driving it to Florida on vacation, costing
226640	231160	the taxpayer an estimated $12,500 in additional wear and tear.
231160	234440	He also outfitted the vehicle with lights and sirens, misrepresenting himself as a law
234440	237920	enforcement officer, invited friends in for so-called Patriot Tours while the capital
237920	242000	was closed to visitors early in the pandemic, and allegedly did not even show up to work
242000	248120	on January 6, 2021, as the building he oversaw was invaded by a mob of election-denying rioters.
248120	252100	McCarthy was the most powerful voice asking for Blanton's removal yet, and having done
252100	256120	so in such a public manner, it was time for Biden to act.
256120	260440	Now, we don't know the exact details of how this particular decision was made because
260440	264120	the minute-by-minute details of a President's day, at least within the White House, are
264120	266280	not a matter of public record.
266280	269300	We get what's called the public schedule, but that only includes what the White House
269300	273320	wants us to know about—usually events open to the public or press.
273320	274800	Mondays include few of those.
274800	278700	They tend to be fairly boring—nobody really schedules events on the first day of the work
278700	283360	week, so no matter the administration, archives of public schedules indicate that, unless
283360	287520	scheduling, Mondays overwhelmingly focus on the kind of internal policy and planning work
287520	292200	that we, the public, don't get to know the details of—at least not for a while.
292200	297040	You see, the White House Office of Appointments and Scheduling does keep track, and like most
297040	301060	non-classified government documents, eventually the public can get access through the rights
301060	303080	granted by the Freedom of Information Act.
303080	307480	Still, there's a FOIA exemption restricting access to presidential records for five years,
307480	311800	then there are months or years of processing time on top of this, so the most recent minute-by-minute
311800	316180	understanding we have of a president's day dates back to the Bush administration.
316180	320480	On a similar boring Monday in February, Bush, a notoriously early riser, arrived at the
320480	324600	Oval Office by 658 and immediately jumped into a series of meetings with his inner circle
324600	327080	before his 8 AM daily briefing.
327080	330400	After was another quick huddle before loading onto Marine One for a quick flight over the
330400	335100	river to Mount Vernon, for a ceremony commemorating the 275th birthday of George Washington, and
335100	339220	then the president was back at the Oval Office just 75 minutes after stepping out.
339220	343080	The rest of the day was a continued cascade of calls and conversations, the most exciting
343080	346980	of which a 90-minute conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, potentially in relation
346980	350740	to the day's announcement that the country would send additional troops to Iraq.
350740	355420	Finally, the Monday wrapped with a small event—a screening of the movie Amazing Grace to Commemorate
355420	358860	Black History Month—before the president finished with dinner in the diplomatic reception
358860	361340	room at 637 PM.
361340	367200	February 13th, 2023 likely looked rather similar for Biden—just a succession of short, unscheduled
367200	370720	meetings with key administration officials, largely in preparation for the rest of the
370720	375600	week, with the exception of making a decision on what to do with the architect of the Capitol.
375600	381360	That clearly happens quickly because, by 3 PM, it's announced—Biden fires Blanton.
381360	386520	Finally, the last task the public knows about is a 4-30 call to Colonel Paris D. Davis,
386520	390360	informing him that, after decades of waiting, he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for
390360	392280	heroism in the Vietnam War.
392280	396700	As usual, the president returned to his residence by 7 PM, finishing the day with dinner and
396700	400320	a read of a collection of ten letters his staff selected out of the countless more sent
400320	405240	to him by the general public—an unexceptional finish to an unexceptional Monday.
405240	409180	The rest of the week, however, would lead up to perhaps the most exceptional day of
409180	412580	his presidency—Tuesday, slightly busier.
412580	416300	It begins with a daily briefing and a call to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to
416300	420460	celebrate the day's announcement that flag carrier Air India would purchase over 200
420460	422700	American-made Boeing aircraft.
422700	425860	Elsewhere in the West Wing, press slowly amble in.
425900	429580	The White House originally told them to arrive at 7 AM, but in the early hours of the morning
429580	431380	their call time was pushed to 930.
431380	435620	While we can only speculate, perhaps the administration wanted them on hand when the months of inflation
435620	439900	report released at 830, but then decided it unnecessary after a tip-off that the numbers
439900	442500	would prove rather negative for the president.
442500	445700	Inflation wasn't slowing as fast as they'd hoped, so there was no reason to amplify the
445700	448580	news with a surprise presidential statement, for example.
448580	452340	But there was still plenty for the press that day, and considering the demand for access
452340	456580	to one of the most powerful people on earth, there's quite a system to manage newsmaking
456580	457860	at the White House.
457860	462300	Three main areas are dedicated to the press—the briefing room, the press corps offices behind,
462300	464100	and the so-called Pebble Beach.
464100	467340	This is a section of the North Lawn where about two dozen television networks have a
467340	469580	near-permanent setup for live shots.
469580	472920	If you've seen a report from the building, it was probably filmed here as the White House
472920	477860	essentially requires it—no longer allowing crews to trample the lawn as they did in decades
477860	478860	before.
478860	483100	Now, these journalists are collectively represented by the White House Correspondents Association.
483100	488380	While they have no codified rights, by tradition, and in recognition of their power in shaping
488380	492560	the public image of a president, the White House awards the association the role of managing
492560	494640	press access to the facility.
494640	498920	But considering there are thousands of association members, decisions need to be made as to who
498920	503180	gets access to what based on the practical limitations of space and time.
503180	507260	For example, it would be entirely impractical for the entire press corps to travel with
507260	511940	the president at all times, but some of the press needs to be with the president at all
511940	512940	times.
512940	516420	If not, we would not have as confident an understanding about how unexpected events
516420	521300	like 9-11 or the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan played out from Bush or Reagan's
521300	522300	perspectives.
522300	527420	So, each day, top association members take turns to compose a smaller, 13-person press
527420	531560	pool—typically composed of a collection of a few wire reporters and photographers,
531560	535880	a TV correspondent and crew, a radio reporter, and a print journalist.
535880	539760	The wire reporters and photographers provide content for their subscribers, which, in the
539760	544040	case of AP and Reuters, is essentially every news organization, while the print journalist
544040	548200	is tasked with writing pool reports for the day, which instantly go out to a massive email
548200	549200	list.
549200	553200	Tuesday's designated pool reporter was Shireesh Dateh from the Huffington Post, who first
553200	557080	informed everyone that the pool was in their vans at 1226, waiting to roll out in their
557080	559040	motorcade with the president.
559040	563180	Weights and vans are a constant for the press pool, as motorcades assemble long before a
563180	567020	president is ready to depart, and today's totaled almost an hour as the next report
567020	571060	indicated the president walked into his limo at 1 21 PM.
571060	574600	With the knowledge of their departure, anyone at the destination knows to get ready if they
574600	576900	want to film the motorcade's arrival.
576900	580420	Further reports circulate who's writing with the president, who he took photos with,
580420	584220	and then a two-minute warning informing recipients to get ready for Biden's remarks—be it
584220	587640	a reporter watching back at the White House briefing room, or a TV director waiting to
587640	589960	cut to a live shot of the speech.
589960	593440	Eventually the moment the speech ends, another report goes out summarizing it, including
593440	596440	one of the most crucial elements—color.
596440	599520	The rest of the press corps can watch the speech from the White House or online, getting
599520	603560	an idea of its content, but it's tougher to interpret more subjective things like audience
603560	604560	reaction.
604560	608200	That's why reports often include notes on this, like the strong response to Biden's
608200	611280	remarks against assault rifles and high-volume magazines.
611280	614720	The corps even gets information on Biden's outfits, like this note that he was wearing
614720	619480	his trademark aviator sunglasses stepping out of his limo upon return to the White House.
619520	623600	But quickly, the travel pool scrambles to the West Wing as the day's briefing is about
623600	624600	to start.
624600	629640	Now, given the question and answer format, where reporters sit matters—the further
629640	632200	forward, the more likely they'll get called on.
632200	636440	The front seats also give a better shot talking to the broadcast cameras at the back.
636440	640320	Even just getting a seat at all is a big deal in that it guarantees access to the room even
640320	644000	on the busiest days, and bestows the right to use the offices to the rear.
644000	648840	That's why the Correspondents' Association has to decide who most deserves one, and therefore
648840	653440	the seating chart essentially acts as a year-by-year ranking of the prominence of various media
653440	654440	organizations.
654440	660000	In 2008, city papers like the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, and Houston Chronicle took up seats
660000	661000	in the rear.
661000	664880	As the economics of print grew more challenging, and therefore budgets increasingly excluded
664880	668520	a White House correspondent, these seats started to get filled by digital outlets like the
668520	670120	Daily Beast or BuzzFeed.
670120	674340	Today's chart includes more outlets than ever as publications have begun the practice
674340	677120	of splitting seats, allowing them to trade off days.
677120	681440	But the prime seats in the first and second rows have stayed consistent through the years,
681440	687680	still fully dedicated to legacy media organizations like CBS, the AP, ABC, and NPR.
687680	692280	Shortly after the briefing concludes, the pool reporter calls a lit—essentially,
692280	695680	communicating that the White House has no more planned public appearances by the President
695680	699680	or their representatives that day, and therefore that reporters can head to the office or home
699680	701240	without worry.
701240	704680	Wednesday was more of the same—internal work, a trip to Maryland for a speech on the
704680	707800	economy—than an early 3.50pm lid.
707800	709400	Thursday, a little more.
709400	713720	At 9am, the President boards Marine One for a short 13-minute flight to Maryland's Walter
713720	716500	Reed Medical Center for his annual physical.
716500	719720	According to a letter released later that day, Biden was recovering well from his COVID
719720	724640	infection in 2022, had occasional issues with gastroesophageal reflux, exhibited a notably
724640	728840	stiffened gait compared to before his foot fracture in 2020, and had a few other minor
728840	733800	issues but in all was a quote, healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully
733800	736260	execute the duties of the presidency.
736260	740320	The President returns to the White House at 1226, and quickly after, a pool report goes
740320	744340	out informing the press that finally, after days of pressure, he would address the spate
744340	748480	of recent shootdowns of unidentified aerial objects above the US.
748480	752840	Once that was done, at 515 the President delivers remarks to open a screening of the movie Till
752840	756920	in the White House's theater in commemoration of Black History Month, and with that, a lid
756920	761560	was called at 530, finishing a relatively busy day leading up to an incredibly busy
761560	762560	weekend.
763000	766840	By Friday, February 17th, the week was winding down.
766840	770760	Without any public availability on the docket for the day, any news coming from the President's
770760	773160	office came in the form of press releases.
773160	776680	Then, at 3.18 in the afternoon, a press lid.
776680	780640	Oddly, though, for a light day and a weekend without work travel, the Bidens decide to
780640	784960	stay in DC, rather than making their regular weekend retreat to Delaware.
784960	789000	In retrospect, though, we know it was due to a quiet meeting, held sometime during the
789000	793440	Saturday, where advisors and Biden decided to add an unannounced, perilous stop to his
793440	795040	scheduled trip.
795040	798920	Despite an impending departure, the Bidens made the most of their Saturday in the city.
798920	803640	The two attend mass at Georgetown, then take in the National Museum of American History.
803640	807400	Closing the night, they head to dinner at the Red Hen, a trendy restaurant in a trendy
807400	810720	area, but the image effect they might have hoped for was overshadowed by the internet
810720	813560	debate they set off by both ordering the same dish.
813560	816080	By 8 PM, they're back at the White House.
816080	819760	For the President, though, the night had just begun.
819760	822220	It's 3.30 AM.
822220	826320	Without any notice or fanfare, a motorcade quietly rolls out of the White House, turning
826320	830840	what had been a rather standard week into a truly unprecedented one.
830840	834560	Normally, when the President heads to Joint Base Andrews to board Air Force One, they
834560	835800	do so by helicopter.
835800	841280	It's safer, it's quicker, and it's less disruptive to motorcade-fatigued DC residents.
841280	844840	But Biden's not supposed to be traveling—he's supposed to be sound asleep in the residence
844840	850440	and a fleet of five Marine One helicopters over downtown DC just sticks out.
850440	852920	Within an hour, the President's airborne.
852920	857640	Accompanying him is an unusually small traveling party composed of three aides and advisors,
857640	861520	a security detail, a medical team, and just two journalists.
861520	865320	Not only is the press pool for the trip unusually small, with only the Wall Street Journal's
865320	869980	Sabrina Siddiqui and the AP's Evan Vucci aboard, the reporting's also on delay as
869980	872820	each handed over their cell phones upon arrival.
872820	875260	Still abnormal, there is some precedent here.
875260	880460	For the sake of image and morale, Presidents have often made trips to active war zones.
880460	882060	Typically these are kept under wraps.
882060	886640	The planning of President Trump's 2019 trip to Afghanistan, for instance, was so quiet
886640	891220	that when he left Mar-a-Lago, some of his Secret Service thought he was still on premise.
891220	895560	On President Trump's trip too, only a precious few knew of his departure, press members'
895560	898860	forfeited phones, and plane windows were blacked out.
898860	903120	Until Biden, though, no American President had visited an active conflict without an
903120	906840	American troop presence, or even a safe airbase to land at.
906840	910800	Slipping into war-torn Ukraine without the presence of the planet's most powerful fighting
910800	914720	force, without direct American air support, vehicles, or troops providing security is
914720	918960	an extreme risk, but a risk deemed by the President as worth it, and a risk deemed by
918960	923540	his security personnel, best minimized by speed and secrecy rather than largess and
923540	925120	brute force.
925140	928820	This cloak-and-dagger planning extended to what plane the President and traveling party
928820	930140	flies to.
930140	933860	Normally Air Force One, the callsign reserved for whatever's flying the President, is
933860	937620	assigned to one of these easily distinguishable VC-25s.
937620	942040	But because these are exclusively used by the President, they're anything but stealthy.
942040	946660	In fact, it was a photo of an airborne VC-25 by a British plane spotter that tipped off
946660	949420	Trump's secret trip to the Middle East in 2019.
949420	954460	Learning from this slip-up, Biden and team boarded a C-32 for its relative anonymity.
954480	959320	Unlike the VC-25, if a C-32 is spotted, it could just as well be the First Lady, the
959320	963480	Vice President, or a cabinet member—not necessarily the President, as these often
963480	966440	carry a host of high-ranking officials.
966440	967840	And it was spotted.
967840	971800	Not long after the C-32 took off from Joint Base Andrews and pointed towards Ramstein
971800	974680	Air Base, this tweet surfaced.
974680	979320	Inocuous enough, using Flightradar24 and publicly available transponder data, the tweet had
979320	982520	identified an irregularity—an oddity.
982540	985700	And now, oddities were beginning to stack.
985700	989240	After the trip to Poland was announced, press members had asked whether the President would
989240	990900	be visiting Ukraine.
990900	995420	Biden had, after all, visited Poland just 11 months earlier, and such a quick return
995420	997140	seemed suspicious.
997140	1001640	And zeroing in further, the Twitter user who had spotted the C-32 initially had now dug
1001640	1006320	deeper and posited that it very well could be President Biden aboard the flight.
1006320	1009860	For their part, though, the President and company weren't waiting for the rest of
1009860	1012120	the world to catch on.
1012120	1017380	Having landed here at 8 PM, a stealth motorcade whisked the President to Przemysl-Gulny train
1017380	1018380	station.
1018380	1022300	While the Ukrainian train's interior lent it an air of stateliness fit for the office,
1022300	1026200	these were not cars overhauled by Biden's team for Biden.
1026200	1030740	It was simply a renovated luxury tourist train, now repurposed to sneak world leaders in and
1030740	1032200	out of the country.
1032200	1035980	Of all the high-risk maneuvers undertaken on this trip, it's likely that this is the
1035980	1040620	most dangerous of all, as the idea of an unarmored train passing eastward, ever nearer to the
1040620	1046180	front lines, left American intelligence navigating a minefield of uncontrollable variables.
1046180	1050280	In the weeks and months prior, this discomfort was made evident as White House planners pushed
1050280	1054080	for safer, more predictable alternatives, like Biden and Zelensky meeting somewhere
1054080	1058200	along the border or in the western city of Lviv, farther from active conflict and nearer
1058200	1059600	to potential intervention.
1059600	1064600	While the exact security detail and contingency planning is still unknown, we do know that
1064600	1068440	the White House did communicate the trip to Russia ahead of time, and that three separate
1068440	1073580	American surveillance aircraft tightly looped overhead as the President crossed the border.
1073580	1080300	Sunday is now Monday, as the 10-hour, 400-mile, 650-kilometer journey comes to an end in Kiev.
1080300	1083740	After a briefing to refresh the President on the city's history, Biden steps aboard
1083740	1086580	a modified white Toyota Land Cruiser.
1086580	1091360	What was a secret is no more, as streets across the heart of Kiev close to traffic and speculation
1091360	1093100	hits fever pitch.
1093100	1097980	Some 30 hours since his last sighting by the press, and after 24 hours of travel, the President
1097980	1104460	pops up nearly 5,000 miles or 8,000 kilometers away from the White House—all for this.
1104460	1108560	A public embrace of President Zelensky, a statement, a laying of a wreath at the wall
1108560	1112040	of remembrance, and a quick stop at the US Embassy.
1112040	1116080	Within five hours, he's already back on the train, heading towards the border, reading
1116080	1118920	briefs, and preparing for tomorrow.
1118920	1122360	Before even completing a trip that will be remembered in history books centuries on,
1122360	1127840	it's already on to the next task—more motorcades, more meetings, and more handshakes.
1128840	1133260	The executive branch understands the power of minor, yet regular, action.
1133260	1137540	Each day in their daily briefing, the President learns a small amount about an ongoing issue,
1137540	1141300	and as that sums up over the days, weeks, and months, they become one of the most informed
1141300	1144000	people in the world on that subject.
1144000	1147920	Our sponsor Brilliant uses the same principles to unlock the ability for anyone to learn
1147920	1150660	some of the most daunting subjects out there.
1150660	1154020	Learning complex subjects is actually rather straightforward—you just have to break them
1154020	1158540	down into smaller chunks that you can understand, and Brilliant does that for you.
1158540	1162240	With their clear explanations and interactive challenges, you learn the chunks, then they
1162240	1164780	build them back up into the broader subject.
1164780	1168560	And on top of making it easier to learn these subjects, this structure allows you to learn
1168560	1172720	as fast or slow as you want—the chunks are small enough that you can learn a component
1172720	1176300	of gravitational physics, for example, just as you're waiting for a meeting or class
1176300	1177300	to start.
1177300	1181600	Then, if you do that enough, eventually you have a confident grasp of subjects that incredibly
1181600	1183000	few others do.
1183000	1187360	I think my favorite courses are the two on logic, because it's just such a fascinating
1187360	1191140	subject, but they have others on mathematical thinking, statistics, computer science, and
1191140	1194180	most of the complicated STEM subjects that you'd want to tackle.
1194180	1197740	I can't recommend them enough, and I feel incredibly grateful that I get to promote
1197740	1201240	such a worthwhile service to pay for these videos, and you can actually try everything
