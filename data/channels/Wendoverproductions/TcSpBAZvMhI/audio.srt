1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,180
7 AM—the alarm rings, the president wakes, and the shades pull back to reveal an unseasonably

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,180
warm Monday morning in Washington, DC.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,120
First up is a walk across the hall to the dining room, where breakfast is served by

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,820
a team led by longtime executive chef Christeta Comerford.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,600
Also provided are reading materials—a packet known as the bulletin, which staffers curate

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,160
to include the news that, these days, Joe Biden wants to read—both as the president

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,160
and as the person.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,380
In addition to the biggest national and international stories, it's known to disproportionately

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,900
include those from his home state of Delaware.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,660
But minutes later, the president walks upstairs to the White House's rarely pictured third

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,660
floor.

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,760
Nestled on its northeast corner is a small workout room, where he starts his days by

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,820
working out with trainer Drew Conteras—one of the many returnees from the Obama administration.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,860
Quick shower, quick change, and it's 9 AM—time for the commute downstairs and across the

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,900
West Colonnade to the fabled Oval Office.

16
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:58,880
$755,580,000 is dedicated to running the presidency in 2023.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,140
Even excluding attributable costs borne by other areas of government, and despite sitting

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:12,020
at its lowest in years, this figure translates to $2,070,079 a day, $86,254 an hour, or $3,593

19
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,460
per minute, meaning spread out evenly, before the president even arrives for work, the American

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:21,040
taxpayer has paid three quarters of a million dollars for the job that day.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,880
One eye-popping sum, but one that could be worth it depending on what happens with the

22
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,500
rest of the day.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,760
The most crucial role of the president is as the go-to when big decisions need to happen

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
quickly.

25
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,880
Therefore, they have to be informed on just about anything that could boil over and reach

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,880
their desk.

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,120
That's why almost every day starts with the most important regular meeting—the daily

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,120
briefing.

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,080
On this Monday, the 13th of February, 2023, that starts exactly at 9 AM, and considering

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,000
she might need to stand in for Biden at moment's notice, Vice President Kamala Harris was all

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
also included, having made the far longer commute down from her residence at the Naval

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Observatory.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,320
The central document of these meetings is prepared by the major American intelligence

34
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,720
agencies, summarizing what they think the president should know, and so it's been

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,000
described as the quote, most highly-sensitized classified document in the government.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Clearly then, there is zero chance the public can legally view any from any time recently,

37
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,400
but the CIA did declassify some—the most recent of which from January 20, 1977, the

38
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,360
final day of the Ford administration.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,680
It starts with a summary of protests against rising food prices in Egypt and the dramatic

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,960
effect it was having on President Anwar Sadat's popularity.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,640
This intelligence proved accurate—he was assassinated four years later.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,460
Next is coverage of stalling peace talks on Cyprus, a still-classified section about West

43
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,740
Germany and France, news about an upcoming trip by Soviet leader Podgorny to India, stalled

44
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,040
price negotiations within OPEC, a trip cut short by Yugoslavia's president, and finally

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,720
a status update on tensions in Benin.

46
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,080
The report's short, the point's brief, but that's the point—the president's

47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
supposed to be the generalist, not the specialist.

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,740
Next Biden meets with his brand new chief of staff, Jeff Zients.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,580
This role is tough to define because it's so all-encompassing, but at the simplest level,

50
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,200
the chief of staff is essentially the manager of the White House—they deal with coordinating

51
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,360
all the operations of the president and their office, even extending to developing policy,

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,880
and therefore it tends to be one of the most powerful positions in perhaps the most powerful

53
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,800
nation on earth, and yet its holder is rarely well-known outside Washington.

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,760
But quickly, a minor crisis.

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,000
Mayor of the House Kevin McCarthy tweets that he's lost confidence in architect of

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,100
the capital, Brett Blanton.

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,840
This is an even less-known position leading the agency that runs the Capital Complex—therefore,

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,440
responsible for some 2,500 employees and an $800 million annual budget.

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,280
But Blanton was facing mounting pressure as a recent Inspector General report highlighted

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,720
a series of missteps—he had accrued 19,000 miles or 30,000 kilometers of prohibited personal

61
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,640
use on his government-issued vehicle, even driving it to Florida on vacation, costing

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,160
the taxpayer an estimated $12,500 in additional wear and tear.

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,440
He also outfitted the vehicle with lights and sirens, misrepresenting himself as a law

64
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:57,920
enforcement officer, invited friends in for so-called Patriot Tours while the capital

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,000
was closed to visitors early in the pandemic, and allegedly did not even show up to work

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,120
on January 6, 2021, as the building he oversaw was invaded by a mob of election-denying rioters.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,100
McCarthy was the most powerful voice asking for Blanton's removal yet, and having done

68
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,120
so in such a public manner, it was time for Biden to act.

69
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,440
Now, we don't know the exact details of how this particular decision was made because

70
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,120
the minute-by-minute details of a President's day, at least within the White House, are

71
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,280
not a matter of public record.

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,300
We get what's called the public schedule, but that only includes what the White House

73
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,320
wants us to know about—usually events open to the public or press.

74
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,800
Mondays include few of those.

75
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,700
They tend to be fairly boring—nobody really schedules events on the first day of the work

76
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,360
week, so no matter the administration, archives of public schedules indicate that, unless

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
scheduling, Mondays overwhelmingly focus on the kind of internal policy and planning work

78
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,200
that we, the public, don't get to know the details of—at least not for a while.

79
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,040
You see, the White House Office of Appointments and Scheduling does keep track, and like most

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,060
non-classified government documents, eventually the public can get access through the rights

81
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,080
granted by the Freedom of Information Act.

82
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,480
Still, there's a FOIA exemption restricting access to presidential records for five years,

83
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,800
then there are months or years of processing time on top of this, so the most recent minute-by-minute

84
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,180
understanding we have of a president's day dates back to the Bush administration.

85
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,480
On a similar boring Monday in February, Bush, a notoriously early riser, arrived at the

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,600
Oval Office by 658 and immediately jumped into a series of meetings with his inner circle

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,080
before his 8 AM daily briefing.

88
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,400
After was another quick huddle before loading onto Marine One for a quick flight over the

89
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,100
river to Mount Vernon, for a ceremony commemorating the 275th birthday of George Washington, and

90
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,220
then the president was back at the Oval Office just 75 minutes after stepping out.

91
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,080
The rest of the day was a continued cascade of calls and conversations, the most exciting

92
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,980
of which a 90-minute conference with the Prime Minister of Australia, potentially in relation

93
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,740
to the day's announcement that the country would send additional troops to Iraq.

94
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,420
Finally, the Monday wrapped with a small event—a screening of the movie Amazing Grace to Commemorate

95
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,860
Black History Month—before the president finished with dinner in the diplomatic reception

96
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,340
room at 637 PM.

97
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,200
February 13th, 2023 likely looked rather similar for Biden—just a succession of short, unscheduled

98
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,720
meetings with key administration officials, largely in preparation for the rest of the

99
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,600
week, with the exception of making a decision on what to do with the architect of the Capitol.

100
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,360
That clearly happens quickly because, by 3 PM, it's announced—Biden fires Blanton.

101
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,520
Finally, the last task the public knows about is a 4-30 call to Colonel Paris D. Davis,

102
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,360
informing him that, after decades of waiting, he would be awarded the Medal of Honor for

103
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,280
heroism in the Vietnam War.

104
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,700
As usual, the president returned to his residence by 7 PM, finishing the day with dinner and

105
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,320
a read of a collection of ten letters his staff selected out of the countless more sent

106
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,240
to him by the general public—an unexceptional finish to an unexceptional Monday.

107
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,180
The rest of the week, however, would lead up to perhaps the most exceptional day of

108
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,580
his presidency—Tuesday, slightly busier.

109
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,300
It begins with a daily briefing and a call to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,460
celebrate the day's announcement that flag carrier Air India would purchase over 200

111
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,700
American-made Boeing aircraft.

112
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,860
Elsewhere in the West Wing, press slowly amble in.

113
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,580
The White House originally told them to arrive at 7 AM, but in the early hours of the morning

114
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,380
their call time was pushed to 930.

115
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,620
While we can only speculate, perhaps the administration wanted them on hand when the months of inflation

116
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,900
report released at 830, but then decided it unnecessary after a tip-off that the numbers

117
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,500
would prove rather negative for the president.

118
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,700
Inflation wasn't slowing as fast as they'd hoped, so there was no reason to amplify the

119
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,580
news with a surprise presidential statement, for example.

120
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,340
But there was still plenty for the press that day, and considering the demand for access

121
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,580
to one of the most powerful people on earth, there's quite a system to manage newsmaking

122
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,860
at the White House.

123
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,300
Three main areas are dedicated to the press—the briefing room, the press corps offices behind,

124
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,100
and the so-called Pebble Beach.

125
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,340
This is a section of the North Lawn where about two dozen television networks have a

126
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,580
near-permanent setup for live shots.

127
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,920
If you've seen a report from the building, it was probably filmed here as the White House

128
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,860
essentially requires it—no longer allowing crews to trample the lawn as they did in decades

129
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
before.

130
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,100
Now, these journalists are collectively represented by the White House Correspondents Association.

131
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,380
While they have no codified rights, by tradition, and in recognition of their power in shaping

132
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,560
the public image of a president, the White House awards the association the role of managing

133
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,640
press access to the facility.

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,920
But considering there are thousands of association members, decisions need to be made as to who

135
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,180
gets access to what based on the practical limitations of space and time.

136
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,260
For example, it would be entirely impractical for the entire press corps to travel with

137
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,940
the president at all times, but some of the press needs to be with the president at all

138
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,940
times.

139
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,420
If not, we would not have as confident an understanding about how unexpected events

140
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,300
like 9-11 or the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan played out from Bush or Reagan's

141
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,300
perspectives.

142
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,420
So, each day, top association members take turns to compose a smaller, 13-person press

143
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,560
pool—typically composed of a collection of a few wire reporters and photographers,

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,880
a TV correspondent and crew, a radio reporter, and a print journalist.

145
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,760
The wire reporters and photographers provide content for their subscribers, which, in the

146
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,040
case of AP and Reuters, is essentially every news organization, while the print journalist

147
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,200
is tasked with writing pool reports for the day, which instantly go out to a massive email

148
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
list.

149
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Tuesday's designated pool reporter was Shireesh Dateh from the Huffington Post, who first

150
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,080
informed everyone that the pool was in their vans at 1226, waiting to roll out in their

151
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,040
motorcade with the president.

152
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,180
Weights and vans are a constant for the press pool, as motorcades assemble long before a

153
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,020
president is ready to depart, and today's totaled almost an hour as the next report

154
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,060
indicated the president walked into his limo at 1 21 PM.

155
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,600
With the knowledge of their departure, anyone at the destination knows to get ready if they

156
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,900
want to film the motorcade's arrival.

157
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,420
Further reports circulate who's writing with the president, who he took photos with,

158
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,220
and then a two-minute warning informing recipients to get ready for Biden's remarks—be it

159
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,640
a reporter watching back at the White House briefing room, or a TV director waiting to

160
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,960
cut to a live shot of the speech.

161
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,440
Eventually the moment the speech ends, another report goes out summarizing it, including

162
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,440
one of the most crucial elements—color.

163
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,520
The rest of the press corps can watch the speech from the White House or online, getting

164
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,560
an idea of its content, but it's tougher to interpret more subjective things like audience

165
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,560
reaction.

166
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,200
That's why reports often include notes on this, like the strong response to Biden's

167
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,280
remarks against assault rifles and high-volume magazines.

168
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,720
The corps even gets information on Biden's outfits, like this note that he was wearing

169
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,480
his trademark aviator sunglasses stepping out of his limo upon return to the White House.

170
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,600
But quickly, the travel pool scrambles to the West Wing as the day's briefing is about

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
to start.

172
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,640
Now, given the question and answer format, where reporters sit matters—the further

173
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,200
forward, the more likely they'll get called on.

174
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,440
The front seats also give a better shot talking to the broadcast cameras at the back.

175
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,320
Even just getting a seat at all is a big deal in that it guarantees access to the room even

176
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
on the busiest days, and bestows the right to use the offices to the rear.

177
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,840
That's why the Correspondents' Association has to decide who most deserves one, and therefore

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,440
the seating chart essentially acts as a year-by-year ranking of the prominence of various media

179
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
organizations.

180
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,000
In 2008, city papers like the LA Times, Chicago Tribune, and Houston Chronicle took up seats

181
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
in the rear.

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,880
As the economics of print grew more challenging, and therefore budgets increasingly excluded

183
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,520
a White House correspondent, these seats started to get filled by digital outlets like the

184
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,120
Daily Beast or BuzzFeed.

185
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,340
Today's chart includes more outlets than ever as publications have begun the practice

186
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,120
of splitting seats, allowing them to trade off days.

187
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,440
But the prime seats in the first and second rows have stayed consistent through the years,

188
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,680
still fully dedicated to legacy media organizations like CBS, the AP, ABC, and NPR.

189
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,280
Shortly after the briefing concludes, the pool reporter calls a lit—essentially,

190
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,680
communicating that the White House has no more planned public appearances by the President

191
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
or their representatives that day, and therefore that reporters can head to the office or home

192
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,240
without worry.

193
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,680
Wednesday was more of the same—internal work, a trip to Maryland for a speech on the

194
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,800
economy—than an early 3.50pm lid.

195
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Thursday, a little more.

196
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,720
At 9am, the President boards Marine One for a short 13-minute flight to Maryland's Walter

197
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,500
Reed Medical Center for his annual physical.

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,720
According to a letter released later that day, Biden was recovering well from his COVID

199
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,640
infection in 2022, had occasional issues with gastroesophageal reflux, exhibited a notably

200
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:08,840
stiffened gait compared to before his foot fracture in 2020, and had a few other minor

201
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,800
issues but in all was a quote, healthy, vigorous, 80-year-old male who is fit to successfully

202
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,260
execute the duties of the presidency.

203
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:20,320
The President returns to the White House at 1226, and quickly after, a pool report goes

204
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,340
out informing the press that finally, after days of pressure, he would address the spate

205
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,480
of recent shootdowns of unidentified aerial objects above the US.

206
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,840
Once that was done, at 515 the President delivers remarks to open a screening of the movie Till

207
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,920
in the White House's theater in commemoration of Black History Month, and with that, a lid

208
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,560
was called at 530, finishing a relatively busy day leading up to an incredibly busy

209
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
weekend.

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,840
By Friday, February 17th, the week was winding down.

211
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,760
Without any public availability on the docket for the day, any news coming from the President's

212
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,160
office came in the form of press releases.

213
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,680
Then, at 3.18 in the afternoon, a press lid.

214
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,640
Oddly, though, for a light day and a weekend without work travel, the Bidens decide to

215
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,960
stay in DC, rather than making their regular weekend retreat to Delaware.

216
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,000
In retrospect, though, we know it was due to a quiet meeting, held sometime during the

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,440
Saturday, where advisors and Biden decided to add an unannounced, perilous stop to his

218
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,040
scheduled trip.

219
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,920
Despite an impending departure, the Bidens made the most of their Saturday in the city.

220
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,640
The two attend mass at Georgetown, then take in the National Museum of American History.

221
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,400
Closing the night, they head to dinner at the Red Hen, a trendy restaurant in a trendy

222
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,720
area, but the image effect they might have hoped for was overshadowed by the internet

223
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,560
debate they set off by both ordering the same dish.

224
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,080
By 8 PM, they're back at the White House.

225
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,760
For the President, though, the night had just begun.

226
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,220
It's 3.30 AM.

227
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,320
Without any notice or fanfare, a motorcade quietly rolls out of the White House, turning

228
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,840
what had been a rather standard week into a truly unprecedented one.

229
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,560
Normally, when the President heads to Joint Base Andrews to board Air Force One, they

230
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,800
do so by helicopter.

231
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,280
It's safer, it's quicker, and it's less disruptive to motorcade-fatigued DC residents.

232
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,840
But Biden's not supposed to be traveling—he's supposed to be sound asleep in the residence

233
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:10,440
and a fleet of five Marine One helicopters over downtown DC just sticks out.

234
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,920
Within an hour, the President's airborne.

235
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,640
Accompanying him is an unusually small traveling party composed of three aides and advisors,

236
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,520
a security detail, a medical team, and just two journalists.

237
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,320
Not only is the press pool for the trip unusually small, with only the Wall Street Journal's

238
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,980
Sabrina Siddiqui and the AP's Evan Vucci aboard, the reporting's also on delay as

239
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,820
each handed over their cell phones upon arrival.

240
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,260
Still abnormal, there is some precedent here.

241
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,460
For the sake of image and morale, Presidents have often made trips to active war zones.

242
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,060
Typically these are kept under wraps.

243
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:46,640
The planning of President Trump's 2019 trip to Afghanistan, for instance, was so quiet

244
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,220
that when he left Mar-a-Lago, some of his Secret Service thought he was still on premise.

245
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,560
On President Trump's trip too, only a precious few knew of his departure, press members'

246
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,860
forfeited phones, and plane windows were blacked out.

247
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,120
Until Biden, though, no American President had visited an active conflict without an

248
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,840
American troop presence, or even a safe airbase to land at.

249
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,800
Slipping into war-torn Ukraine without the presence of the planet's most powerful fighting

250
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,720
force, without direct American air support, vehicles, or troops providing security is

251
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,960
an extreme risk, but a risk deemed by the President as worth it, and a risk deemed by

252
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,540
his security personnel, best minimized by speed and secrecy rather than largess and

253
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,120
brute force.

254
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,820
This cloak-and-dagger planning extended to what plane the President and traveling party

255
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,140
flies to.

256
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,860
Normally Air Force One, the callsign reserved for whatever's flying the President, is

257
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,620
assigned to one of these easily distinguishable VC-25s.

258
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,040
But because these are exclusively used by the President, they're anything but stealthy.

259
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,660
In fact, it was a photo of an airborne VC-25 by a British plane spotter that tipped off

260
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,420
Trump's secret trip to the Middle East in 2019.

261
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,460
Learning from this slip-up, Biden and team boarded a C-32 for its relative anonymity.

262
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,320
Unlike the VC-25, if a C-32 is spotted, it could just as well be the First Lady, the

263
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:03,480
Vice President, or a cabinet member—not necessarily the President, as these often

264
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,440
carry a host of high-ranking officials.

265
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,840
And it was spotted.

266
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,800
Not long after the C-32 took off from Joint Base Andrews and pointed towards Ramstein

267
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,680
Air Base, this tweet surfaced.

268
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,320
Inocuous enough, using Flightradar24 and publicly available transponder data, the tweet had

269
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,520
identified an irregularity—an oddity.

270
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,700
And now, oddities were beginning to stack.

271
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,240
After the trip to Poland was announced, press members had asked whether the President would

272
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,900
be visiting Ukraine.

273
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,420
Biden had, after all, visited Poland just 11 months earlier, and such a quick return

274
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,140
seemed suspicious.

275
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:41,640
And zeroing in further, the Twitter user who had spotted the C-32 initially had now dug

276
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:46,320
deeper and posited that it very well could be President Biden aboard the flight.

277
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,860
For their part, though, the President and company weren't waiting for the rest of

278
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,120
the world to catch on.

279
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,380
Having landed here at 8 PM, a stealth motorcade whisked the President to Przemysl-Gulny train

280
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,380
station.

281
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,300
While the Ukrainian train's interior lent it an air of stateliness fit for the office,

282
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,200
these were not cars overhauled by Biden's team for Biden.

283
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,740
It was simply a renovated luxury tourist train, now repurposed to sneak world leaders in and

284
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,200
out of the country.

285
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,980
Of all the high-risk maneuvers undertaken on this trip, it's likely that this is the

286
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,620
most dangerous of all, as the idea of an unarmored train passing eastward, ever nearer to the

287
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:26,180
front lines, left American intelligence navigating a minefield of uncontrollable variables.

288
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,280
In the weeks and months prior, this discomfort was made evident as White House planners pushed

289
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:34,080
for safer, more predictable alternatives, like Biden and Zelensky meeting somewhere

290
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,200
along the border or in the western city of Lviv, farther from active conflict and nearer

291
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,600
to potential intervention.

292
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,600
While the exact security detail and contingency planning is still unknown, we do know that

293
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,440
the White House did communicate the trip to Russia ahead of time, and that three separate

294
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,580
American surveillance aircraft tightly looped overhead as the President crossed the border.

295
00:17:53,580 --> 00:18:00,300
Sunday is now Monday, as the 10-hour, 400-mile, 650-kilometer journey comes to an end in Kiev.

296
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,740
After a briefing to refresh the President on the city's history, Biden steps aboard

297
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:06,580
a modified white Toyota Land Cruiser.

298
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,360
What was a secret is no more, as streets across the heart of Kiev close to traffic and speculation

299
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,100
hits fever pitch.

300
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,980
Some 30 hours since his last sighting by the press, and after 24 hours of travel, the President

301
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:24,460
pops up nearly 5,000 miles or 8,000 kilometers away from the White House—all for this.

302
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,560
A public embrace of President Zelensky, a statement, a laying of a wreath at the wall

303
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,040
of remembrance, and a quick stop at the US Embassy.

304
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,080
Within five hours, he's already back on the train, heading towards the border, reading

305
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,920
briefs, and preparing for tomorrow.

306
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,360
Before even completing a trip that will be remembered in history books centuries on,

307
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,840
it's already on to the next task—more motorcades, more meetings, and more handshakes.

308
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:53,260
The executive branch understands the power of minor, yet regular, action.

309
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,540
Each day in their daily briefing, the President learns a small amount about an ongoing issue,

310
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,300
and as that sums up over the days, weeks, and months, they become one of the most informed

311
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,000
people in the world on that subject.

312
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,920
Our sponsor Brilliant uses the same principles to unlock the ability for anyone to learn

313
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,660
some of the most daunting subjects out there.

314
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,020
Learning complex subjects is actually rather straightforward—you just have to break them

315
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,540
down into smaller chunks that you can understand, and Brilliant does that for you.

316
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,240
With their clear explanations and interactive challenges, you learn the chunks, then they

317
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,780
build them back up into the broader subject.

318
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,560
And on top of making it easier to learn these subjects, this structure allows you to learn

319
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,720
as fast or slow as you want—the chunks are small enough that you can learn a component

320
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,300
of gravitational physics, for example, just as you're waiting for a meeting or class

321
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,300
to start.

322
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:41,600
Then, if you do that enough, eventually you have a confident grasp of subjects that incredibly

323
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,000
few others do.

324
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,360
I think my favorite courses are the two on logic, because it's just such a fascinating

325
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,140
subject, but they have others on mathematical thinking, statistics, computer science, and

326
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,180
most of the complicated STEM subjects that you'd want to tackle.

327
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,740
I can't recommend them enough, and I feel incredibly grateful that I get to promote

328
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,240
such a worthwhile service to pay for these videos, and you can actually try everything

329
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,580
Brilliant has to offer free for a full 30 days by clicking the button on screen or heading

330
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,260
to brilliant.org slash wendover.

331
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,880
And then, the first 200 of you to do so will get 20% off Brilliant's annual premium subscription,

332
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,600
and you'll be supporting Wendover while you're at it, so thanks in advance.
