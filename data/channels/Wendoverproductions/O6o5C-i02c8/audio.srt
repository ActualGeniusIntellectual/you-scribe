00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,660
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,980
Which way should the toilet paper hang?

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,980
Over or under?

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,840
It's a point of international contention that's been touched on by All in the Family,

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,280
Archie, and the Simpsons and creates rifts in hundreds of marriages every year.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,640
To understand the argument, let's look at the pros for each orientation.

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,560
We'll start with over.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,060
Perhaps the greatest objective advantage of this setup is that it reduces the chance that

16
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,700
your knuckles will run against the wall.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,140
This is more than an unpleasant experience.

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,580
It could transfer dangerous germs, especially if you're in a public restroom.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,540
Over also makes it easier to grasp the ends since the loose end is visually distinguished

20
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,540
and further away from the wall.

21
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,300
Hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, and others can also fold the toilet paper to indicate

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,720
that the room has been cleaned in the over orientation.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,100
Now for the under orientation.

24
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,340
This way arguably has a tidier appearance since the loose end of toilet paper is more

25
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,680
hidden from view.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,540
It also makes it more difficult for toddlers or pets to unravel the roll if batting at

27
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,540
it.

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,380
City owners also report that a roll hung under is less likely to unravel on its own while

29
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,460
driving.

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,440
As a quick side note, I'll bring you a real letter exchange between the customer and the

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,760
chairman of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher.

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,940
The customer wrote,

33
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,080
Last week in my journey to SFO, someone put the toilet paper in roll.

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,740
Any damn fool knows the papers come out the bottom of the roll and not over the top.

35
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,440
I couldn't figure out how to correct the error.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
Herb responded,

37
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,460
Dear Jim, what the hell were you doing upside down in our laboratory?

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:57,560
Back to the debate.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,080
In general, the public prefers toilet paper hanged over.

40
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,920
Most surveys find between 60 and 70% of individuals say that they put their toilet paper in the

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
over orientation.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,040
What's more interesting, however, is to look at who prefers which orientation.

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,200
Older people tend to have a higher preference to hang their toilet paper over, while middle

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
aged people are most likely to hang their teepee under.

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,800
What's most interesting is to look at the preferences by socio-economic class.

46
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:30,080
60% of people who are in 50,000 or more prefer the toilet paper over, while 73% of people

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,720
who are in less than 20,000 annually prefer the toilet paper under.

48
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
When the researcher Barry Sinrod was asked what this means, he responded,

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
I don't know, but it's sure interesting.

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,040
One other research project concluded that liberals prefer over, while conservatives

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,320
prefer under.

52
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,280
Now let's go a little bit deeper.

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,760
Therapist Gilda Karl theorized that the way someone hangs their toilet paper can tell

54
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,480
you something about their personality.

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,960
She says, if you roll over, you like taking charge, crave organization, and are likely

56
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,660
to overachieve.

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,980
If you roll under, you're laid back, dependable, and seek relationships with strong foundations.

58
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,260
On another note, the butler of Princess Diana, Paul Burrell, was asked which method is better

59
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,300
and said, of course it should be over.

60
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,160
If it were down, it would unravel all over the floor.

61
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,980
Royals don't have that problem though, because they have sheets of tissue which are fanned

62
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,900
out into an attractive display and sit in a box.

63
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,580
So that's one way to solve the issue, or we could just look at the patent.

64
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,340
Oh, well, that settles it.

65
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,060
It was made to hang over.

66
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,540
Come back next week for more intellectual discussions.
