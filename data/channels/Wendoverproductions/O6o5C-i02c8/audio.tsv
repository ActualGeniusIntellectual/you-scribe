0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13380	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13380	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21060	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21060	24660	bit more about our amazing world.
24660	26980	Which way should the toilet paper hang?
26980	27980	Over or under?
27980	32840	It's a point of international contention that's been touched on by All in the Family,
32840	37280	Archie, and the Simpsons and creates rifts in hundreds of marriages every year.
37280	40640	To understand the argument, let's look at the pros for each orientation.
40640	42560	We'll start with over.
42560	47060	Perhaps the greatest objective advantage of this setup is that it reduces the chance that
47060	49700	your knuckles will run against the wall.
49700	52140	This is more than an unpleasant experience.
52140	56580	It could transfer dangerous germs, especially if you're in a public restroom.
56580	61540	Over also makes it easier to grasp the ends since the loose end is visually distinguished
61540	63540	and further away from the wall.
63540	68300	Hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, and others can also fold the toilet paper to indicate
68300	71720	that the room has been cleaned in the over orientation.
71720	74100	Now for the under orientation.
74100	78340	This way arguably has a tidier appearance since the loose end of toilet paper is more
78340	79680	hidden from view.
79680	84540	It also makes it more difficult for toddlers or pets to unravel the roll if batting at
84540	85540	it.
85580	90380	City owners also report that a roll hung under is less likely to unravel on its own while
90380	91460	driving.
91460	95440	As a quick side note, I'll bring you a real letter exchange between the customer and the
95440	98760	chairman of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher.
98760	99940	The customer wrote,
99940	104080	Last week in my journey to SFO, someone put the toilet paper in roll.
104080	108740	Any damn fool knows the papers come out the bottom of the roll and not over the top.
108740	111440	I couldn't figure out how to correct the error.
111440	112440	Herb responded,
112560	116460	Dear Jim, what the hell were you doing upside down in our laboratory?
116460	117560	Back to the debate.
117560	121080	In general, the public prefers toilet paper hanged over.
121080	125920	Most surveys find between 60 and 70% of individuals say that they put their toilet paper in the
125920	126920	over orientation.
126920	132040	What's more interesting, however, is to look at who prefers which orientation.
132040	136200	Older people tend to have a higher preference to hang their toilet paper over, while middle
136200	139200	aged people are most likely to hang their teepee under.
139720	143800	What's most interesting is to look at the preferences by socio-economic class.
143800	150080	60% of people who are in 50,000 or more prefer the toilet paper over, while 73% of people
150080	154720	who are in less than 20,000 annually prefer the toilet paper under.
154720	158080	When the researcher Barry Sinrod was asked what this means, he responded,
158080	160800	I don't know, but it's sure interesting.
160800	165040	One other research project concluded that liberals prefer over, while conservatives
165040	167320	prefer under.
167320	169280	Now let's go a little bit deeper.
169280	173760	Therapist Gilda Karl theorized that the way someone hangs their toilet paper can tell
173760	176480	you something about their personality.
176480	181960	She says, if you roll over, you like taking charge, crave organization, and are likely
181960	183660	to overachieve.
183660	189980	If you roll under, you're laid back, dependable, and seek relationships with strong foundations.
189980	195260	On another note, the butler of Princess Diana, Paul Burrell, was asked which method is better
195260	197300	and said, of course it should be over.
197300	200160	If it were down, it would unravel all over the floor.
200160	203980	Royals don't have that problem though, because they have sheets of tissue which are fanned
203980	207900	out into an attractive display and sit in a box.
207900	211580	So that's one way to solve the issue, or we could just look at the patent.
211580	214340	Oh, well, that settles it.
214340	216060	It was made to hang over.
