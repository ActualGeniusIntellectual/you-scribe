00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.380 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.060 --> 00:24.660
bit more about our amazing world.

00:24.660 --> 00:26.980
Which way should the toilet paper hang?

00:26.980 --> 00:27.980
Over or under?

00:27.980 --> 00:32.840
It's a point of international contention that's been touched on by All in the Family,

00:32.840 --> 00:37.280
Archie, and the Simpsons and creates rifts in hundreds of marriages every year.

00:37.280 --> 00:40.640
To understand the argument, let's look at the pros for each orientation.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.560
We'll start with over.

00:42.560 --> 00:47.060
Perhaps the greatest objective advantage of this setup is that it reduces the chance that

00:47.060 --> 00:49.700
your knuckles will run against the wall.

00:49.700 --> 00:52.140
This is more than an unpleasant experience.

00:52.140 --> 00:56.580
It could transfer dangerous germs, especially if you're in a public restroom.

00:56.580 --> 01:01.540
Over also makes it easier to grasp the ends since the loose end is visually distinguished

01:01.540 --> 01:03.540
and further away from the wall.

01:03.540 --> 01:08.300
Hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, and others can also fold the toilet paper to indicate

01:08.300 --> 01:11.720
that the room has been cleaned in the over orientation.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.100
Now for the under orientation.

01:14.100 --> 01:18.340
This way arguably has a tidier appearance since the loose end of toilet paper is more

01:18.340 --> 01:19.680
hidden from view.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.540
It also makes it more difficult for toddlers or pets to unravel the roll if batting at

01:24.540 --> 01:25.540
it.

01:25.580 --> 01:30.380
City owners also report that a roll hung under is less likely to unravel on its own while

01:30.380 --> 01:31.460
driving.

01:31.460 --> 01:35.440
As a quick side note, I'll bring you a real letter exchange between the customer and the

01:35.440 --> 01:38.760
chairman of Southwest Airlines, Herb Kelleher.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.940
The customer wrote,

01:39.940 --> 01:44.080
Last week in my journey to SFO, someone put the toilet paper in roll.

01:44.080 --> 01:48.740
Any damn fool knows the papers come out the bottom of the roll and not over the top.

01:48.740 --> 01:51.440
I couldn't figure out how to correct the error.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.440
Herb responded,

01:52.560 --> 01:56.460
Dear Jim, what the hell were you doing upside down in our laboratory?

01:56.460 --> 01:57.560
Back to the debate.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.080
In general, the public prefers toilet paper hanged over.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.920
Most surveys find between 60 and 70% of individuals say that they put their toilet paper in the

02:05.920 --> 02:06.920
over orientation.

02:06.920 --> 02:12.040
What's more interesting, however, is to look at who prefers which orientation.

02:12.040 --> 02:16.200
Older people tend to have a higher preference to hang their toilet paper over, while middle

02:16.200 --> 02:19.200
aged people are most likely to hang their teepee under.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.800
What's most interesting is to look at the preferences by socio-economic class.

02:23.800 --> 02:30.080
60% of people who are in 50,000 or more prefer the toilet paper over, while 73% of people

02:30.080 --> 02:34.720
who are in less than 20,000 annually prefer the toilet paper under.

02:34.720 --> 02:38.080
When the researcher Barry Sinrod was asked what this means, he responded,

02:38.080 --> 02:40.800
I don't know, but it's sure interesting.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.040
One other research project concluded that liberals prefer over, while conservatives

02:45.040 --> 02:47.320
prefer under.

02:47.320 --> 02:49.280
Now let's go a little bit deeper.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.760
Therapist Gilda Karl theorized that the way someone hangs their toilet paper can tell

02:53.760 --> 02:56.480
you something about their personality.

02:56.480 --> 03:01.960
She says, if you roll over, you like taking charge, crave organization, and are likely

03:01.960 --> 03:03.660
to overachieve.

03:03.660 --> 03:09.980
If you roll under, you're laid back, dependable, and seek relationships with strong foundations.

03:09.980 --> 03:15.260
On another note, the butler of Princess Diana, Paul Burrell, was asked which method is better

03:15.260 --> 03:17.300
and said, of course it should be over.

03:17.300 --> 03:20.160
If it were down, it would unravel all over the floor.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.980
Royals don't have that problem though, because they have sheets of tissue which are fanned

03:23.980 --> 03:27.900
out into an attractive display and sit in a box.

03:27.900 --> 03:31.580
So that's one way to solve the issue, or we could just look at the patent.

03:31.580 --> 03:34.340
Oh, well, that settles it.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.060
It was made to hang over.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.540
Come back next week for more intellectual discussions.
