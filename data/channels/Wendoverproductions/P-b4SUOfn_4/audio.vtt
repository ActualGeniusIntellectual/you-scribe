00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
This is Every Country in the World by Wendover Productions.

00:04.360 --> 00:08.000
We'll start with Afghanistan—the first country alphabetically.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.720
Afghanistan is one of the few countries worldwide to be offset from Greenwich Mean Time by a

00:11.720 --> 00:12.720
30 minute interval.

00:12.720 --> 00:16.680
It's at GMT plus 4 hours and 30 minutes while China is one of the many countries to

00:16.680 --> 00:21.640
only have one time zone except it's ginormous so that means that stepping over the 47 mile

00:21.640 --> 00:25.920
long Afghanistan-China border jumps you forward by three and a half hours.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.040
That's the largest single time zone jump on earth.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.360
China, in all its craziness, has a rather ambitious plan to build a high speed railroad

00:32.360 --> 00:36.400
from Beijing up across the Bering Strait and down into the United States which happens

00:36.400 --> 00:40.140
to be the home of 41% of Wendover Productions viewers.

00:40.140 --> 00:44.460
Up in the northwest of the US, Point Roberts, a part of the mainland US, is cut off from

00:44.460 --> 00:48.340
the US by Canada and since it doesn't have a high school, students have to cross into

00:48.340 --> 00:52.160
Canada then back into the US each day on their way to school.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.720
Canada happens to be the second largest country on earth and has more lakes than the rest

00:55.720 --> 00:56.720
of the world combined.

00:56.760 --> 01:02.400
It's so huge in fact that its easternmost point is closer to Croatia than it is to Vancouver.

01:02.400 --> 01:06.680
One of Croatia's thousands of islands is Rab, the birthplace of the sculptor Marinas

01:06.680 --> 01:10.820
who went on and founded San Marino, the fifth smallest country in the world and one of three

01:10.820 --> 01:13.400
to be completely surrounded by another country.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.040
One of the others is the Vatican, the smallest sovereign state in the world, and there's

01:17.040 --> 01:20.980
also Lesotho which is home to one of Africa's seven ski resorts.

01:20.980 --> 01:24.580
Lesotho is of course surrounded by South Africa which is the only country in the world to

01:24.580 --> 01:26.160
have three capitals.

01:26.160 --> 01:30.460
Cape Town is the seat of the parliament, Pretoria is home to the president, and Bloemfontein

01:30.460 --> 01:32.040
is the judicial capital.

01:32.040 --> 01:36.660
South Africa also almost completely surrounds another country, Swaziland, where roads are

01:36.660 --> 01:41.000
so bad that two of the last four transport ministers died in car accidents.

01:41.000 --> 01:45.580
While mostly surrounded by South Africa, Swaziland's eastern border is with Mozambique whose name

01:45.580 --> 01:50.320
scores higher in Scrabble than any other one word country, but in second place for Scrabble

01:50.320 --> 01:54.940
is Kyrgyzstan which is home to six enclaves, the smallest of which is part of Uzbekistan

01:54.940 --> 01:56.980
and is only two miles wide.

01:56.980 --> 02:02.420
In Uzbekistan, no river leads to the ocean—they all drain into endorheic basins where water

02:02.420 --> 02:04.300
evaporates out.

02:04.300 --> 02:08.980
Uzbekistan is one of only two countries worldwide to be double landlocked—as in, landlocked

02:08.980 --> 02:10.680
by landlocked countries.

02:10.680 --> 02:15.260
In this case, every surrounding country of Uzbekistan also ends in Stan—Kazakhstan,

02:15.260 --> 02:19.100
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.

02:19.100 --> 02:23.940
The other double landlocked country is Liechtenstein, a tiny and historically neutral nation.

02:23.940 --> 02:28.940
In their last military engagement in 1886, none of the 80 soldiers were injured or killed

02:28.940 --> 02:34.340
and they actually returned with 81 people since they made a quote, new Italian friend.

02:34.340 --> 02:39.620
Italy is home to the Broyservinia ski resort where you can ski across the border into Switzerland.

02:39.620 --> 02:44.100
Switzerland is rather paranoid about war to the extent that 3,000 points of entry into

02:44.100 --> 02:47.980
the country are rigged to blow at an instant in case of invasion.

02:47.980 --> 02:52.140
Switzerland is also home to one end of the shortest regularly scheduled commercial international

02:52.140 --> 02:57.000
flight in the world—a six minute, ten mile jaunt over to Germany where it's not actually

02:57.000 --> 02:58.780
illegal to escape prison.

02:58.780 --> 03:01.140
Seriously, they say it's only human nature.

03:01.140 --> 03:05.220
Germany is home to half of one of the world's few internationally divided islands and the

03:05.220 --> 03:09.780
Polish side of this island, despite being only 200 feet from mainland Poland, is not

03:09.780 --> 03:14.420
connected by any bridges to Poland so just like Point Roberts, residents have to cross

03:14.420 --> 03:17.260
international borders to get to their own country.

03:17.260 --> 03:21.940
Poland also happens to have been part of Sweden's monarchy for a brief eight years in the 16th

03:21.940 --> 03:22.940
century.

03:22.940 --> 03:28.080
Sweden has an internationally divided island too and this one is a mere seven acres large.

03:28.080 --> 03:32.060
The border looks like this because Finland accidentally built a lighthouse in Swedish

03:32.060 --> 03:36.020
territory and so they just readjusted the border to make everyone happy.

03:36.020 --> 03:43.340
Finland has exactly 187,888 lakes and its northernmost point is actually closer to Greenland

03:43.340 --> 03:46.100
than Poland due to the curvature of the earth.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.020
Greenland isn't actually a country so I'm not allowed to talk about it.

03:49.100 --> 03:52.780
It's a dependency of Denmark where it's impossible to be more than 30 miles from the

03:52.780 --> 03:53.780
ocean.

03:53.780 --> 03:57.820
The wife of Denmark's crown prince, Crown Princess Mary, was born in Australia, which

03:57.820 --> 04:02.540
is the sixth largest country on earth, and is home to the longest fence in the world—a

04:02.540 --> 04:07.060
3,500 mile structure to keep wild dogs out of the fertile southeast region.

04:07.060 --> 04:13.060
The middle of Australia also has practically nobody and nothing in it except a 297 mile

04:13.060 --> 04:16.440
long, precisely straight section of railroad track.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.320
Australia freed the country of Brunei from occupation back in World War 2 which is one

04:20.320 --> 04:24.720
of the few countries worldwide to be comprised of two comparably sized sections.

04:24.720 --> 04:29.400
St. Kitts and Nevis is also split into two but that's because it's a two island nation

04:29.400 --> 04:32.060
and also the smallest country in the Americas.

04:32.060 --> 04:37.200
In St. Kitts and Nevis, you can gain citizenship by making a $400,000 real estate investment,

04:37.200 --> 04:41.080
much like Bulgaria where people nod up and down to signify no and shake left and right

04:41.080 --> 04:42.080
to mean yes.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.700
Bulgaria is one of the few countries to have an embassy in North Korea which created its

04:45.700 --> 04:49.660
own time zone in 2015 for no real reason than to be different.

04:49.660 --> 04:53.940
North Korea is only separated by one country from Norway where more than half the population

04:53.940 --> 04:55.560
lives below this line.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.020
Between Norway and North Korea is of course Russia, the largest country in the world.

04:59.020 --> 05:02.460
Its easternmost point is, in fact, closer to Mexico than Moscow.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.540
Mexico once had three different presidents in one hour during a military coup, but also

05:06.540 --> 05:11.020
accustomed to short regimes is Alsace-Lorraine in France which was a fully recognized independent

05:11.020 --> 05:15.140
country for 12 short days between being a part of Germany and France at the end of World

05:15.180 --> 05:20.180
War I. France, of course, had an enormous empire including Algeria which is the largest

05:20.180 --> 05:24.740
country in Africa and, unlike some of its bordering countries, is quite nice to women.

05:24.740 --> 05:27.540
70% of the country's lawyers are female.

05:27.540 --> 05:32.700
Right next door to Algeria is Morocco which has de facto control of some of western Sahara—a

05:32.700 --> 05:36.420
place that's really not part of any country—that's why it's always blank on data maps.

05:36.420 --> 05:41.380
Morocco surrounds two Spanish exclaves, Ceuta and Meilla, which are politically part of

05:41.380 --> 05:46.180
mainland Spain rather than overseas territories despite being in northern Africa.

05:46.180 --> 05:51.540
Spain once had an enormous empire, part of which was Micronesia which is now a US associated

05:51.540 --> 05:56.420
state meaning that they're an independent nation but the US covers defense and funding.

05:56.420 --> 06:00.980
Micronesian citizens can join the US military without becoming a US resident—a right only

06:00.980 --> 06:03.440
given to freely associated states.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.820
Their currency is also the US dollar.

06:05.820 --> 06:10.460
Palau is also a nearby US associated state which is often compared to Fiji since they're

06:10.460 --> 06:15.760
both idyllic Pacific island destinations even though they're over 3,500 miles apart.

06:15.760 --> 06:20.340
Fiji was a British colony up until 1970 and you have no idea how hard it was to avoid

06:20.340 --> 06:21.980
using this transition up until now.

06:21.980 --> 06:25.820
I could have used it with Nauru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Brunei, Australia, South Africa,

06:25.820 --> 06:29.320
Canada, the United States, and Afghanistan, but I kept it for now.

06:29.320 --> 06:34.020
The UK is home to the shortest regularly scheduled commercial flight in the world between Westray

06:34.020 --> 06:36.200
and Papa Westray in the Scottish Isles.

06:36.200 --> 06:41.440
It costs 17 pounds, takes 53 seconds, and traverses only 1.7 miles.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.520
The UK has two ex-claves, both of which are overseas territories.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.800
One is Gibraltar, right across from Ceuta, and the other is Akrotiri and Decalia on the

06:49.800 --> 06:51.160
island of Cyprus.

06:51.160 --> 06:56.440
There are border control agents from three countries on Cyprus—the UK, Cyprus, and

06:56.440 --> 06:57.440
Turkey.

06:57.440 --> 07:01.200
Northern Cyprus is a self-declared state only recognized by Turkey who helps them keep

07:01.200 --> 07:05.640
control of the territory with a heavy military presence and border control agents.

07:05.640 --> 07:09.800
Istanbul, Turkey is the only city on the planet to span two continents—Europe and

07:09.800 --> 07:12.660
Asia—although there are plenty of countries on two continents.

07:12.660 --> 07:16.880
In Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula sits in Asia while the rest is in Africa.

07:16.880 --> 07:20.780
Just past the southern border of Egypt is Berthawil—a piece of land claimed by no

07:20.780 --> 07:24.600
country since Egypt and Sudan disagree on where their borders are.

07:24.600 --> 07:29.400
Sudan recently split into two and created South Sudan, the world's youngest UN recognized

07:29.400 --> 07:30.400
country.

07:30.400 --> 07:35.320
The second youngest country is Serbia which, up until 2006, was called Serbia and Montenegro,

07:35.320 --> 07:37.240
but split after a referendum.

07:37.240 --> 07:41.820
Montenegro also happens to be a town in Costa Rica where about 100 people live.

07:41.820 --> 07:46.800
The capital of Costa Rica, San Jose, only allows car owners to drive six days a week

07:46.800 --> 07:50.980
to fight pollution and congestion so the last digit of license plates correspond to their

07:50.980 --> 07:51.980
ban day.

07:51.980 --> 07:56.960
Costa Rica's southern border is with Panama, home to the Panama Canal, which, counter-intuitively,

07:56.960 --> 08:01.440
has its Atlantic end—the ocean to the east—to the west and its Pacific end—the ocean to

08:01.440 --> 08:02.920
the west—to the east.

08:02.920 --> 08:07.120
Panama's southern border is with Colombia, but there's not one road crossing this 50

08:07.120 --> 08:11.620
mile jungle which means it's impossible to drive between North and South America.

08:11.620 --> 08:15.600
You probably know that Colombia was once part of Spain, but so was the Netherlands.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.320
It was called the Spanish Netherlands.

08:17.320 --> 08:22.000
The Netherlands is also home to Barley-Nassau—one of the most messed up borders in the world.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.980
Belgium is well known for having a UN headquarters and so does Nairobi, Kenya—the suspected

08:26.980 --> 08:28.640
birthplace of the human race.

08:28.640 --> 08:34.440
Kenya's northern neighbor is Somalia which received its first ATM machine in 2014.

08:34.440 --> 08:39.560
Somalia has had three separate wars with Ethiopia in the last century and Ethiopia's national

08:39.560 --> 08:44.880
airline was the second to receive the 787 Dreamliner despite being the 13th poorest

08:44.880 --> 08:45.960
country.

08:45.960 --> 08:51.520
Ethiopia also has another one of those internationally divided islands—this one with Djibouti—which

08:51.520 --> 08:57.000
is home to the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, at 509 feet below sea level.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.720
Djibouti also hosts the only US military base in Africa and Israel hosts one of the smallest

09:01.720 --> 09:04.080
ones—Damona Radar Base.

09:04.080 --> 09:08.440
Despite being a middle eastern country, Israel competes in Eurovision and many European sports

09:08.440 --> 09:12.480
leagues since they're culturally much closer to Europe than the middle east.

09:12.480 --> 09:16.320
Israel has one of the weirder international borders with Palestine which is only a country

09:16.320 --> 09:17.760
depending on who you ask.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.760
The largest Palestinian community outside the Arab world is in Chile which is one of

09:21.760 --> 09:25.400
the only countries to have a government sponsored UFO research organization.

09:25.440 --> 09:29.480
Chile is the southernmost mainland country in the world but doesn't have the southernmost

09:29.480 --> 09:30.880
commercial airport.

09:30.880 --> 09:35.180
That title goes to Argentina with their Ushuaia Malvinas International Airport.

09:35.180 --> 09:39.500
This spectacular waterfall is the border between Argentina and Brazil which is home to the

09:39.500 --> 09:44.240
Amazon river which doesn't have a single bridge over it—not one, it's just in an

09:44.240 --> 09:46.360
area where practically nobody lives.

09:46.360 --> 09:51.420
Recife, Brazil is closer to Dakar, Senegal than to Port Alegre in southwestern Brazil.

09:51.420 --> 09:55.500
Just off the coast of Senegal is Cape Verde which is pretty much paradise.

09:55.500 --> 10:00.260
They have a high human development index score, high GDP, high literacy rate, and the lowest

10:00.260 --> 10:03.880
recorded temperature in history there was 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

10:03.880 --> 10:08.360
As a former Portuguese colony, Cape Verde speaks Portuguese which is the 6th most spoken

10:08.360 --> 10:13.320
language in the world even though its origin country, Portugal, is smaller than Kentucky.

10:13.320 --> 10:18.260
They just have an enormous empire which for a while included Indonesia which has another

10:18.260 --> 10:22.700
one of those internationally divided islands with Papua New Guinea similar to Hispaniola

10:22.700 --> 10:26.700
Island which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

10:26.700 --> 10:31.140
Hispaniola is the 22nd largest island in the world, but Madagascar is number 4.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.860
It's also the largest single island country.

10:33.860 --> 10:38.520
85 million years ago, Madagascar was connected to India before the continent shifted, but

10:38.520 --> 10:44.980
Sri Lanka was connected to India as recently as 1480 via a land bridge that has since eroded.

10:44.980 --> 10:49.100
Sri Lanka is just north of the equator, but right on the equator is Ecuador.

10:49.100 --> 10:53.860
Its capital, Quito, is only 20 miles from the equator so its day length varies by only

10:53.860 --> 10:58.580
15 minutes between winter and summer, although, since the country is split by the equator,

10:58.580 --> 11:02.260
winter and summer happens at the same time in the same country.

11:02.260 --> 11:06.140
Ecuador is one of the 30 countries to have an Antarctic research base and right next

11:06.140 --> 11:08.340
door to Ecuador's base is Peru's.

11:08.340 --> 11:14.460
Copacabana—not that one, this one—in Bolivia can only be reached by driving through Peru.

11:14.460 --> 11:20.540
Bolivia, despite being a landlocked country, maintains a 5,000 person navy although Mongolia,

11:20.540 --> 11:25.580
also a landlocked country, maintains a navy that has one ship, a tugboat, and seven total

11:25.580 --> 11:26.700
sailors.

11:26.700 --> 11:30.860
Mongolia is also the least dense country on the planet with only five people per square

11:30.860 --> 11:31.860
mile.

11:31.860 --> 11:36.100
While they may seem unintimidating now, the Mongolian empire was once the largest contiguous

11:36.100 --> 11:38.200
land empire in history.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.900
Part of that empire was Cambodia which has changed its name six times in the last 65

11:42.900 --> 11:43.900
years.

11:43.940 --> 11:47.000
75% of Cambodia's population is Theravada Buddhist.

11:47.000 --> 11:51.040
The other major branch of Buddhism is Maya Hana Buddhism which is practiced in Japan

11:51.040 --> 11:57.100
where, out of the total population of 126 million, they had three gun murders in 2012.

11:57.100 --> 12:01.820
Iceland, however, can top that because they had one murder total in 2012.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.620
Of course, Iceland doesn't have a huge population which makes it seem less impressive until

12:05.620 --> 12:09.300
you consider that 30% of Iceland's residents own guns.

12:09.300 --> 12:12.820
60% of that population, however, lives in this circle.

12:12.820 --> 12:17.260
Iceland was also the first country to recognize Armenia's independence and Armenia separates

12:17.260 --> 12:22.700
Azerbaijan from its Nightshivan exclave and since the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed,

12:22.700 --> 12:27.340
residents of Nightshivan have to go all the way around Armenia to get to their own country.

12:27.340 --> 12:31.900
Azerbaijan's national soccer team has played Andorras five times in the last few decades

12:31.900 --> 12:35.180
and four of those games have ended in a 0-0 tie.

12:35.180 --> 12:39.020
Andorra is the largest country in the world to not have an airport which is less impressive

12:39.020 --> 12:41.760
when you consider that they're the 19th smallest in the world.

12:41.760 --> 12:45.640
The smallest country in the world to have a major international airport is the Maldives,

12:45.640 --> 12:47.320
the 8th smallest country.

12:47.320 --> 12:52.140
This airport has dozens of destinations and is on a small island with no land connections

12:52.140 --> 12:56.400
to other islands which means that once you land you have to either take a boat or a seaplane

12:56.400 --> 12:57.860
to your destination.

12:57.860 --> 13:02.200
One of the airport's destinations is Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia which is home to the world's

13:02.200 --> 13:06.000
largest roundabout in Putrajaya at two miles in diameter.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.300
Malaysia is the only country connected by road to Singapore, the largest surviving city

13:10.300 --> 13:11.340
state in the world.

13:11.340 --> 13:15.540
Despite having hundreds of skyscrapers, Singapore is not the densest country in the world.

13:15.540 --> 13:19.460
That title goes to Monaco which is less than one square mile large.

13:19.460 --> 13:24.100
Monaco has no income tax, much like the Bahamas, which is one of two countries to have the

13:24.100 --> 13:28.040
word the in its official name—the other one being the Gambia.

13:28.040 --> 13:32.200
The Gambia's interesting shape comes from the flow of the river Gambia whose watershed

13:32.200 --> 13:35.940
reaches all the way to Guinea which is one of three countries to have the word Guinea

13:35.940 --> 13:36.940
in its name.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.460
The other two are Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea.

13:39.460 --> 13:43.260
Guinea was once the word for the entire West African region so when these countries became

13:43.260 --> 13:47.460
independent from their colonizers, many chose to include Guinea in their names.

13:47.460 --> 13:51.820
Equatorial Guinea's capital actually isn't on the mainland, it's on an offshore island

13:51.820 --> 13:55.900
and despite its name, the equator doesn't actually intersect Equatorial Guinea, but

13:55.900 --> 14:00.080
the country is on both sides of the equator since they have sovereignty over Anabon Island

14:00.080 --> 14:01.660
to the south of the equator.

14:01.660 --> 14:06.140
This is similar to Kiribati, a nation comprising of a few dozen islands in the Pacific.

14:06.140 --> 14:11.980
Kiribati is the first place on earth to experience New Years since their time zone is UTC plus

14:11.980 --> 14:15.140
14, a time zone exclusive to these islands.

14:15.140 --> 14:19.540
Kiribati is close friends with Cuba since Cuba sent doctors to the islands who reduced

14:19.540 --> 14:22.020
the child mortality rate by 80%.

14:22.020 --> 14:26.500
Cuba, the only Caribbean island to have a commercial railroad, is one of the few remaining

14:26.500 --> 14:27.940
communist states.

14:27.940 --> 14:33.180
One of the others is Laos, the only landlocked country in southeast Asia, which borders Vietnam,

14:33.180 --> 14:37.780
also communist, and the 14th most populous country in the world despite having the size

14:37.780 --> 14:39.660
of about New Mexico.

14:39.660 --> 14:43.720
Vietnam is good political friends with Venezuela who is not great friends with bordering Guyana

14:43.720 --> 14:47.100
since Guyana thinks that the border looks like this and Venezuela thinks the border

14:47.100 --> 14:48.100
looks like this.

14:48.100 --> 14:53.020
Guyana, the only English speaking country in South America, borders Suriname, the smallest

14:53.020 --> 14:57.660
country in South America and the only country, other than the Netherlands, whose sole primary

14:57.660 --> 14:59.020
language is Dutch.

14:59.020 --> 15:03.540
Suriname was our 98th country so that means that we're halfway through and that that's

15:03.540 --> 15:06.700
the end of part one of every country in the world.

15:06.700 --> 15:11.780
However, part two will be out on Tuesday December 13th so make sure you're subscribed to catch

15:11.780 --> 15:13.420
that right when it comes out.
