0	4360	This is Every Country in the World by Wendover Productions.
4360	8000	We'll start with Afghanistan—the first country alphabetically.
8000	11720	Afghanistan is one of the few countries worldwide to be offset from Greenwich Mean Time by a
11720	12720	30 minute interval.
12720	16680	It's at GMT plus 4 hours and 30 minutes while China is one of the many countries to
16680	21640	only have one time zone except it's ginormous so that means that stepping over the 47 mile
21640	25920	long Afghanistan-China border jumps you forward by three and a half hours.
25920	29040	That's the largest single time zone jump on earth.
29080	32360	China, in all its craziness, has a rather ambitious plan to build a high speed railroad
32360	36400	from Beijing up across the Bering Strait and down into the United States which happens
36400	40140	to be the home of 41% of Wendover Productions viewers.
40140	44460	Up in the northwest of the US, Point Roberts, a part of the mainland US, is cut off from
44460	48340	the US by Canada and since it doesn't have a high school, students have to cross into
48340	52160	Canada then back into the US each day on their way to school.
52160	55720	Canada happens to be the second largest country on earth and has more lakes than the rest
55720	56720	of the world combined.
56760	62400	It's so huge in fact that its easternmost point is closer to Croatia than it is to Vancouver.
62400	66680	One of Croatia's thousands of islands is Rab, the birthplace of the sculptor Marinas
66680	70820	who went on and founded San Marino, the fifth smallest country in the world and one of three
70820	73400	to be completely surrounded by another country.
73400	77040	One of the others is the Vatican, the smallest sovereign state in the world, and there's
77040	80980	also Lesotho which is home to one of Africa's seven ski resorts.
80980	84580	Lesotho is of course surrounded by South Africa which is the only country in the world to
84580	86160	have three capitals.
86160	90460	Cape Town is the seat of the parliament, Pretoria is home to the president, and Bloemfontein
90460	92040	is the judicial capital.
92040	96660	South Africa also almost completely surrounds another country, Swaziland, where roads are
96660	101000	so bad that two of the last four transport ministers died in car accidents.
101000	105580	While mostly surrounded by South Africa, Swaziland's eastern border is with Mozambique whose name
105580	110320	scores higher in Scrabble than any other one word country, but in second place for Scrabble
110320	114940	is Kyrgyzstan which is home to six enclaves, the smallest of which is part of Uzbekistan
114940	116980	and is only two miles wide.
116980	122420	In Uzbekistan, no river leads to the ocean—they all drain into endorheic basins where water
122420	124300	evaporates out.
124300	128980	Uzbekistan is one of only two countries worldwide to be double landlocked—as in, landlocked
128980	130680	by landlocked countries.
130680	135260	In this case, every surrounding country of Uzbekistan also ends in Stan—Kazakhstan,
135260	139100	Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.
139100	143940	The other double landlocked country is Liechtenstein, a tiny and historically neutral nation.
143940	148940	In their last military engagement in 1886, none of the 80 soldiers were injured or killed
148940	154340	and they actually returned with 81 people since they made a quote, new Italian friend.
154340	159620	Italy is home to the Broyservinia ski resort where you can ski across the border into Switzerland.
159620	164100	Switzerland is rather paranoid about war to the extent that 3,000 points of entry into
164100	167980	the country are rigged to blow at an instant in case of invasion.
167980	172140	Switzerland is also home to one end of the shortest regularly scheduled commercial international
172140	177000	flight in the world—a six minute, ten mile jaunt over to Germany where it's not actually
177000	178780	illegal to escape prison.
178780	181140	Seriously, they say it's only human nature.
181140	185220	Germany is home to half of one of the world's few internationally divided islands and the
185220	189780	Polish side of this island, despite being only 200 feet from mainland Poland, is not
189780	194420	connected by any bridges to Poland so just like Point Roberts, residents have to cross
194420	197260	international borders to get to their own country.
197260	201940	Poland also happens to have been part of Sweden's monarchy for a brief eight years in the 16th
201940	202940	century.
202940	208080	Sweden has an internationally divided island too and this one is a mere seven acres large.
208080	212060	The border looks like this because Finland accidentally built a lighthouse in Swedish
212060	216020	territory and so they just readjusted the border to make everyone happy.
216020	223340	Finland has exactly 187,888 lakes and its northernmost point is actually closer to Greenland
223340	226100	than Poland due to the curvature of the earth.
226100	229020	Greenland isn't actually a country so I'm not allowed to talk about it.
229100	232780	It's a dependency of Denmark where it's impossible to be more than 30 miles from the
232780	233780	ocean.
233780	237820	The wife of Denmark's crown prince, Crown Princess Mary, was born in Australia, which
237820	242540	is the sixth largest country on earth, and is home to the longest fence in the world—a
242540	247060	3,500 mile structure to keep wild dogs out of the fertile southeast region.
247060	253060	The middle of Australia also has practically nobody and nothing in it except a 297 mile
253060	256440	long, precisely straight section of railroad track.
256440	260320	Australia freed the country of Brunei from occupation back in World War 2 which is one
260320	264720	of the few countries worldwide to be comprised of two comparably sized sections.
264720	269400	St. Kitts and Nevis is also split into two but that's because it's a two island nation
269400	272060	and also the smallest country in the Americas.
272060	277200	In St. Kitts and Nevis, you can gain citizenship by making a $400,000 real estate investment,
277200	281080	much like Bulgaria where people nod up and down to signify no and shake left and right
281080	282080	to mean yes.
282080	285700	Bulgaria is one of the few countries to have an embassy in North Korea which created its
285700	289660	own time zone in 2015 for no real reason than to be different.
289660	293940	North Korea is only separated by one country from Norway where more than half the population
293940	295560	lives below this line.
295560	299020	Between Norway and North Korea is of course Russia, the largest country in the world.
299020	302460	Its easternmost point is, in fact, closer to Mexico than Moscow.
302460	306540	Mexico once had three different presidents in one hour during a military coup, but also
306540	311020	accustomed to short regimes is Alsace-Lorraine in France which was a fully recognized independent
311020	315140	country for 12 short days between being a part of Germany and France at the end of World
315180	320180	War I. France, of course, had an enormous empire including Algeria which is the largest
320180	324740	country in Africa and, unlike some of its bordering countries, is quite nice to women.
324740	327540	70% of the country's lawyers are female.
327540	332700	Right next door to Algeria is Morocco which has de facto control of some of western Sahara—a
332700	336420	place that's really not part of any country—that's why it's always blank on data maps.
336420	341380	Morocco surrounds two Spanish exclaves, Ceuta and Meilla, which are politically part of
341380	346180	mainland Spain rather than overseas territories despite being in northern Africa.
346180	351540	Spain once had an enormous empire, part of which was Micronesia which is now a US associated
351540	356420	state meaning that they're an independent nation but the US covers defense and funding.
356420	360980	Micronesian citizens can join the US military without becoming a US resident—a right only
360980	363440	given to freely associated states.
363440	365820	Their currency is also the US dollar.
365820	370460	Palau is also a nearby US associated state which is often compared to Fiji since they're
370460	375760	both idyllic Pacific island destinations even though they're over 3,500 miles apart.
375760	380340	Fiji was a British colony up until 1970 and you have no idea how hard it was to avoid
380340	381980	using this transition up until now.
381980	385820	I could have used it with Nauru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Brunei, Australia, South Africa,
385820	389320	Canada, the United States, and Afghanistan, but I kept it for now.
389320	394020	The UK is home to the shortest regularly scheduled commercial flight in the world between Westray
394020	396200	and Papa Westray in the Scottish Isles.
396200	401440	It costs 17 pounds, takes 53 seconds, and traverses only 1.7 miles.
401440	405520	The UK has two ex-claves, both of which are overseas territories.
405520	409800	One is Gibraltar, right across from Ceuta, and the other is Akrotiri and Decalia on the
409800	411160	island of Cyprus.
411160	416440	There are border control agents from three countries on Cyprus—the UK, Cyprus, and
416440	417440	Turkey.
417440	421200	Northern Cyprus is a self-declared state only recognized by Turkey who helps them keep
421200	425640	control of the territory with a heavy military presence and border control agents.
425640	429800	Istanbul, Turkey is the only city on the planet to span two continents—Europe and
429800	432660	Asia—although there are plenty of countries on two continents.
432660	436880	In Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula sits in Asia while the rest is in Africa.
436880	440780	Just past the southern border of Egypt is Berthawil—a piece of land claimed by no
440780	444600	country since Egypt and Sudan disagree on where their borders are.
444600	449400	Sudan recently split into two and created South Sudan, the world's youngest UN recognized
449400	450400	country.
450400	455320	The second youngest country is Serbia which, up until 2006, was called Serbia and Montenegro,
455320	457240	but split after a referendum.
457240	461820	Montenegro also happens to be a town in Costa Rica where about 100 people live.
461820	466800	The capital of Costa Rica, San Jose, only allows car owners to drive six days a week
466800	470980	to fight pollution and congestion so the last digit of license plates correspond to their
470980	471980	ban day.
471980	476960	Costa Rica's southern border is with Panama, home to the Panama Canal, which, counter-intuitively,
476960	481440	has its Atlantic end—the ocean to the east—to the west and its Pacific end—the ocean to
481440	482920	the west—to the east.
482920	487120	Panama's southern border is with Colombia, but there's not one road crossing this 50
487120	491620	mile jungle which means it's impossible to drive between North and South America.
491620	495600	You probably know that Colombia was once part of Spain, but so was the Netherlands.
495600	497320	It was called the Spanish Netherlands.
497320	502000	The Netherlands is also home to Barley-Nassau—one of the most messed up borders in the world.
502000	506980	Belgium is well known for having a UN headquarters and so does Nairobi, Kenya—the suspected
506980	508640	birthplace of the human race.
508640	514440	Kenya's northern neighbor is Somalia which received its first ATM machine in 2014.
514440	519560	Somalia has had three separate wars with Ethiopia in the last century and Ethiopia's national
519560	524880	airline was the second to receive the 787 Dreamliner despite being the 13th poorest
524880	525960	country.
525960	531520	Ethiopia also has another one of those internationally divided islands—this one with Djibouti—which
531520	537000	is home to the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, at 509 feet below sea level.
537000	541720	Djibouti also hosts the only US military base in Africa and Israel hosts one of the smallest
541720	544080	ones—Damona Radar Base.
544080	548440	Despite being a middle eastern country, Israel competes in Eurovision and many European sports
548440	552480	leagues since they're culturally much closer to Europe than the middle east.
552480	556320	Israel has one of the weirder international borders with Palestine which is only a country
556320	557760	depending on who you ask.
557760	561760	The largest Palestinian community outside the Arab world is in Chile which is one of
561760	565400	the only countries to have a government sponsored UFO research organization.
565440	569480	Chile is the southernmost mainland country in the world but doesn't have the southernmost
569480	570880	commercial airport.
570880	575180	That title goes to Argentina with their Ushuaia Malvinas International Airport.
575180	579500	This spectacular waterfall is the border between Argentina and Brazil which is home to the
579500	584240	Amazon river which doesn't have a single bridge over it—not one, it's just in an
584240	586360	area where practically nobody lives.
586360	591420	Recife, Brazil is closer to Dakar, Senegal than to Port Alegre in southwestern Brazil.
591420	595500	Just off the coast of Senegal is Cape Verde which is pretty much paradise.
595500	600260	They have a high human development index score, high GDP, high literacy rate, and the lowest
600260	603880	recorded temperature in history there was 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
603880	608360	As a former Portuguese colony, Cape Verde speaks Portuguese which is the 6th most spoken
608360	613320	language in the world even though its origin country, Portugal, is smaller than Kentucky.
613320	618260	They just have an enormous empire which for a while included Indonesia which has another
618260	622700	one of those internationally divided islands with Papua New Guinea similar to Hispaniola
622700	626700	Island which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
626700	631140	Hispaniola is the 22nd largest island in the world, but Madagascar is number 4.
631140	633860	It's also the largest single island country.
633860	638520	85 million years ago, Madagascar was connected to India before the continent shifted, but
638520	644980	Sri Lanka was connected to India as recently as 1480 via a land bridge that has since eroded.
644980	649100	Sri Lanka is just north of the equator, but right on the equator is Ecuador.
649100	653860	Its capital, Quito, is only 20 miles from the equator so its day length varies by only
653860	658580	15 minutes between winter and summer, although, since the country is split by the equator,
658580	662260	winter and summer happens at the same time in the same country.
662260	666140	Ecuador is one of the 30 countries to have an Antarctic research base and right next
666140	668340	door to Ecuador's base is Peru's.
668340	674460	Copacabana—not that one, this one—in Bolivia can only be reached by driving through Peru.
674460	680540	Bolivia, despite being a landlocked country, maintains a 5,000 person navy although Mongolia,
680540	685580	also a landlocked country, maintains a navy that has one ship, a tugboat, and seven total
685580	686700	sailors.
686700	690860	Mongolia is also the least dense country on the planet with only five people per square
690860	691860	mile.
691860	696100	While they may seem unintimidating now, the Mongolian empire was once the largest contiguous
696100	698200	land empire in history.
698200	702900	Part of that empire was Cambodia which has changed its name six times in the last 65
702900	703900	years.
703940	707000	75% of Cambodia's population is Theravada Buddhist.
707000	711040	The other major branch of Buddhism is Maya Hana Buddhism which is practiced in Japan
711040	717100	where, out of the total population of 126 million, they had three gun murders in 2012.
717100	721820	Iceland, however, can top that because they had one murder total in 2012.
721820	725620	Of course, Iceland doesn't have a huge population which makes it seem less impressive until
725620	729300	you consider that 30% of Iceland's residents own guns.
729300	732820	60% of that population, however, lives in this circle.
732820	737260	Iceland was also the first country to recognize Armenia's independence and Armenia separates
737260	742700	Azerbaijan from its Nightshivan exclave and since the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed,
742700	747340	residents of Nightshivan have to go all the way around Armenia to get to their own country.
747340	751900	Azerbaijan's national soccer team has played Andorras five times in the last few decades
751900	755180	and four of those games have ended in a 0-0 tie.
755180	759020	Andorra is the largest country in the world to not have an airport which is less impressive
759020	761760	when you consider that they're the 19th smallest in the world.
761760	765640	The smallest country in the world to have a major international airport is the Maldives,
765640	767320	the 8th smallest country.
767320	772140	This airport has dozens of destinations and is on a small island with no land connections
772140	776400	to other islands which means that once you land you have to either take a boat or a seaplane
776400	777860	to your destination.
777860	782200	One of the airport's destinations is Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia which is home to the world's
782200	786000	largest roundabout in Putrajaya at two miles in diameter.
786000	790300	Malaysia is the only country connected by road to Singapore, the largest surviving city
790300	791340	state in the world.
791340	795540	Despite having hundreds of skyscrapers, Singapore is not the densest country in the world.
795540	799460	That title goes to Monaco which is less than one square mile large.
799460	804100	Monaco has no income tax, much like the Bahamas, which is one of two countries to have the
804100	808040	word the in its official name—the other one being the Gambia.
808040	812200	The Gambia's interesting shape comes from the flow of the river Gambia whose watershed
812200	815940	reaches all the way to Guinea which is one of three countries to have the word Guinea
815940	816940	in its name.
816940	819460	The other two are Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea.
819460	823260	Guinea was once the word for the entire West African region so when these countries became
823260	827460	independent from their colonizers, many chose to include Guinea in their names.
827460	831820	Equatorial Guinea's capital actually isn't on the mainland, it's on an offshore island
831820	835900	and despite its name, the equator doesn't actually intersect Equatorial Guinea, but
835900	840080	the country is on both sides of the equator since they have sovereignty over Anabon Island
840080	841660	to the south of the equator.
841660	846140	This is similar to Kiribati, a nation comprising of a few dozen islands in the Pacific.
846140	851980	Kiribati is the first place on earth to experience New Years since their time zone is UTC plus
851980	855140	14, a time zone exclusive to these islands.
855140	859540	Kiribati is close friends with Cuba since Cuba sent doctors to the islands who reduced
859540	862020	the child mortality rate by 80%.
862020	866500	Cuba, the only Caribbean island to have a commercial railroad, is one of the few remaining
866500	867940	communist states.
867940	873180	One of the others is Laos, the only landlocked country in southeast Asia, which borders Vietnam,
873180	877780	also communist, and the 14th most populous country in the world despite having the size
877780	879660	of about New Mexico.
879660	883720	Vietnam is good political friends with Venezuela who is not great friends with bordering Guyana
883720	887100	since Guyana thinks that the border looks like this and Venezuela thinks the border
887100	888100	looks like this.
888100	893020	Guyana, the only English speaking country in South America, borders Suriname, the smallest
893020	897660	country in South America and the only country, other than the Netherlands, whose sole primary
897660	899020	language is Dutch.
899020	903540	Suriname was our 98th country so that means that we're halfway through and that that's
903540	906700	the end of part one of every country in the world.
906700	911780	However, part two will be out on Tuesday December 13th so make sure you're subscribed to catch
