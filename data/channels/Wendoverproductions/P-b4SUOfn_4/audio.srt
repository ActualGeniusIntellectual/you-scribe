00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
This is Every Country in the World by Wendover Productions.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,000
We'll start with Afghanistan—the first country alphabetically.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,720
Afghanistan is one of the few countries worldwide to be offset from Greenwich Mean Time by a

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
30 minute interval.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,680
It's at GMT plus 4 hours and 30 minutes while China is one of the many countries to

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,640
only have one time zone except it's ginormous so that means that stepping over the 47 mile

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,920
long Afghanistan-China border jumps you forward by three and a half hours.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,040
That's the largest single time zone jump on earth.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,360
China, in all its craziness, has a rather ambitious plan to build a high speed railroad

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,400
from Beijing up across the Bering Strait and down into the United States which happens

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,140
to be the home of 41% of Wendover Productions viewers.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,460
Up in the northwest of the US, Point Roberts, a part of the mainland US, is cut off from

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,340
the US by Canada and since it doesn't have a high school, students have to cross into

14
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,160
Canada then back into the US each day on their way to school.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,720
Canada happens to be the second largest country on earth and has more lakes than the rest

16
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
of the world combined.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,400
It's so huge in fact that its easternmost point is closer to Croatia than it is to Vancouver.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,680
One of Croatia's thousands of islands is Rab, the birthplace of the sculptor Marinas

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,820
who went on and founded San Marino, the fifth smallest country in the world and one of three

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,400
to be completely surrounded by another country.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,040
One of the others is the Vatican, the smallest sovereign state in the world, and there's

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,980
also Lesotho which is home to one of Africa's seven ski resorts.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,580
Lesotho is of course surrounded by South Africa which is the only country in the world to

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,160
have three capitals.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,460
Cape Town is the seat of the parliament, Pretoria is home to the president, and Bloemfontein

26
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,040
is the judicial capital.

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,660
South Africa also almost completely surrounds another country, Swaziland, where roads are

28
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,000
so bad that two of the last four transport ministers died in car accidents.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,580
While mostly surrounded by South Africa, Swaziland's eastern border is with Mozambique whose name

30
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,320
scores higher in Scrabble than any other one word country, but in second place for Scrabble

31
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,940
is Kyrgyzstan which is home to six enclaves, the smallest of which is part of Uzbekistan

32
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,980
and is only two miles wide.

33
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:02,420
In Uzbekistan, no river leads to the ocean—they all drain into endorheic basins where water

34
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,300
evaporates out.

35
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,980
Uzbekistan is one of only two countries worldwide to be double landlocked—as in, landlocked

36
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,680
by landlocked countries.

37
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,260
In this case, every surrounding country of Uzbekistan also ends in Stan—Kazakhstan,

38
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,100
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,940
The other double landlocked country is Liechtenstein, a tiny and historically neutral nation.

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,940
In their last military engagement in 1886, none of the 80 soldiers were injured or killed

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:34,340
and they actually returned with 81 people since they made a quote, new Italian friend.

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,620
Italy is home to the Broyservinia ski resort where you can ski across the border into Switzerland.

43
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,100
Switzerland is rather paranoid about war to the extent that 3,000 points of entry into

44
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,980
the country are rigged to blow at an instant in case of invasion.

45
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,140
Switzerland is also home to one end of the shortest regularly scheduled commercial international

46
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,000
flight in the world—a six minute, ten mile jaunt over to Germany where it's not actually

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,780
illegal to escape prison.

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,140
Seriously, they say it's only human nature.

49
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,220
Germany is home to half of one of the world's few internationally divided islands and the

50
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,780
Polish side of this island, despite being only 200 feet from mainland Poland, is not

51
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,420
connected by any bridges to Poland so just like Point Roberts, residents have to cross

52
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,260
international borders to get to their own country.

53
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,940
Poland also happens to have been part of Sweden's monarchy for a brief eight years in the 16th

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
century.

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,080
Sweden has an internationally divided island too and this one is a mere seven acres large.

56
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,060
The border looks like this because Finland accidentally built a lighthouse in Swedish

57
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,020
territory and so they just readjusted the border to make everyone happy.

58
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:43,340
Finland has exactly 187,888 lakes and its northernmost point is actually closer to Greenland

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,100
than Poland due to the curvature of the earth.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,020
Greenland isn't actually a country so I'm not allowed to talk about it.

61
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,780
It's a dependency of Denmark where it's impossible to be more than 30 miles from the

62
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,780
ocean.

63
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,820
The wife of Denmark's crown prince, Crown Princess Mary, was born in Australia, which

64
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,540
is the sixth largest country on earth, and is home to the longest fence in the world—a

65
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:07,060
3,500 mile structure to keep wild dogs out of the fertile southeast region.

66
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:13,060
The middle of Australia also has practically nobody and nothing in it except a 297 mile

67
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,440
long, precisely straight section of railroad track.

68
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,320
Australia freed the country of Brunei from occupation back in World War 2 which is one

69
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
of the few countries worldwide to be comprised of two comparably sized sections.

70
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,400
St. Kitts and Nevis is also split into two but that's because it's a two island nation

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,060
and also the smallest country in the Americas.

72
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,200
In St. Kitts and Nevis, you can gain citizenship by making a $400,000 real estate investment,

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,080
much like Bulgaria where people nod up and down to signify no and shake left and right

74
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
to mean yes.

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,700
Bulgaria is one of the few countries to have an embassy in North Korea which created its

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,660
own time zone in 2015 for no real reason than to be different.

77
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:53,940
North Korea is only separated by one country from Norway where more than half the population

78
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,560
lives below this line.

79
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,020
Between Norway and North Korea is of course Russia, the largest country in the world.

80
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,460
Its easternmost point is, in fact, closer to Mexico than Moscow.

81
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,540
Mexico once had three different presidents in one hour during a military coup, but also

82
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,020
accustomed to short regimes is Alsace-Lorraine in France which was a fully recognized independent

83
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,140
country for 12 short days between being a part of Germany and France at the end of World

84
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:20,180
War I. France, of course, had an enormous empire including Algeria which is the largest

85
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,740
country in Africa and, unlike some of its bordering countries, is quite nice to women.

86
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,540
70% of the country's lawyers are female.

87
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,700
Right next door to Algeria is Morocco which has de facto control of some of western Sahara—a

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,420
place that's really not part of any country—that's why it's always blank on data maps.

89
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:41,380
Morocco surrounds two Spanish exclaves, Ceuta and Meilla, which are politically part of

90
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,180
mainland Spain rather than overseas territories despite being in northern Africa.

91
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,540
Spain once had an enormous empire, part of which was Micronesia which is now a US associated

92
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:56,420
state meaning that they're an independent nation but the US covers defense and funding.

93
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:00,980
Micronesian citizens can join the US military without becoming a US resident—a right only

94
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,440
given to freely associated states.

95
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,820
Their currency is also the US dollar.

96
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,460
Palau is also a nearby US associated state which is often compared to Fiji since they're

97
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,760
both idyllic Pacific island destinations even though they're over 3,500 miles apart.

98
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,340
Fiji was a British colony up until 1970 and you have no idea how hard it was to avoid

99
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,980
using this transition up until now.

100
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,820
I could have used it with Nauru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Brunei, Australia, South Africa,

101
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,320
Canada, the United States, and Afghanistan, but I kept it for now.

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,020
The UK is home to the shortest regularly scheduled commercial flight in the world between Westray

103
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,200
and Papa Westray in the Scottish Isles.

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,440
It costs 17 pounds, takes 53 seconds, and traverses only 1.7 miles.

105
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,520
The UK has two ex-claves, both of which are overseas territories.

106
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,800
One is Gibraltar, right across from Ceuta, and the other is Akrotiri and Decalia on the

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,160
island of Cyprus.

108
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,440
There are border control agents from three countries on Cyprus—the UK, Cyprus, and

109
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
Turkey.

110
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,200
Northern Cyprus is a self-declared state only recognized by Turkey who helps them keep

111
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,640
control of the territory with a heavy military presence and border control agents.

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,800
Istanbul, Turkey is the only city on the planet to span two continents—Europe and

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,660
Asia—although there are plenty of countries on two continents.

114
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,880
In Egypt, the Sinai Peninsula sits in Asia while the rest is in Africa.

115
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,780
Just past the southern border of Egypt is Berthawil—a piece of land claimed by no

116
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,600
country since Egypt and Sudan disagree on where their borders are.

117
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,400
Sudan recently split into two and created South Sudan, the world's youngest UN recognized

118
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
country.

119
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,320
The second youngest country is Serbia which, up until 2006, was called Serbia and Montenegro,

120
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,240
but split after a referendum.

121
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,820
Montenegro also happens to be a town in Costa Rica where about 100 people live.

122
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,800
The capital of Costa Rica, San Jose, only allows car owners to drive six days a week

123
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,980
to fight pollution and congestion so the last digit of license plates correspond to their

124
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
ban day.

125
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,960
Costa Rica's southern border is with Panama, home to the Panama Canal, which, counter-intuitively,

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,440
has its Atlantic end—the ocean to the east—to the west and its Pacific end—the ocean to

127
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,920
the west—to the east.

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,120
Panama's southern border is with Colombia, but there's not one road crossing this 50

129
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,620
mile jungle which means it's impossible to drive between North and South America.

130
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,600
You probably know that Colombia was once part of Spain, but so was the Netherlands.

131
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,320
It was called the Spanish Netherlands.

132
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,000
The Netherlands is also home to Barley-Nassau—one of the most messed up borders in the world.

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,980
Belgium is well known for having a UN headquarters and so does Nairobi, Kenya—the suspected

134
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,640
birthplace of the human race.

135
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,440
Kenya's northern neighbor is Somalia which received its first ATM machine in 2014.

136
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,560
Somalia has had three separate wars with Ethiopia in the last century and Ethiopia's national

137
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,880
airline was the second to receive the 787 Dreamliner despite being the 13th poorest

138
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,960
country.

139
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Ethiopia also has another one of those internationally divided islands—this one with Djibouti—which

140
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:57,000
is home to the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, at 509 feet below sea level.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Djibouti also hosts the only US military base in Africa and Israel hosts one of the smallest

142
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,080
ones—Damona Radar Base.

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,440
Despite being a middle eastern country, Israel competes in Eurovision and many European sports

144
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,480
leagues since they're culturally much closer to Europe than the middle east.

145
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,320
Israel has one of the weirder international borders with Palestine which is only a country

146
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,760
depending on who you ask.

147
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,760
The largest Palestinian community outside the Arab world is in Chile which is one of

148
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,400
the only countries to have a government sponsored UFO research organization.

149
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,480
Chile is the southernmost mainland country in the world but doesn't have the southernmost

150
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,880
commercial airport.

151
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,180
That title goes to Argentina with their Ushuaia Malvinas International Airport.

152
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,500
This spectacular waterfall is the border between Argentina and Brazil which is home to the

153
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,240
Amazon river which doesn't have a single bridge over it—not one, it's just in an

154
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,360
area where practically nobody lives.

155
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,420
Recife, Brazil is closer to Dakar, Senegal than to Port Alegre in southwestern Brazil.

156
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,500
Just off the coast of Senegal is Cape Verde which is pretty much paradise.

157
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,260
They have a high human development index score, high GDP, high literacy rate, and the lowest

158
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,880
recorded temperature in history there was 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

159
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,360
As a former Portuguese colony, Cape Verde speaks Portuguese which is the 6th most spoken

160
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,320
language in the world even though its origin country, Portugal, is smaller than Kentucky.

161
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,260
They just have an enormous empire which for a while included Indonesia which has another

162
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,700
one of those internationally divided islands with Papua New Guinea similar to Hispaniola

163
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Island which is divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

164
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,140
Hispaniola is the 22nd largest island in the world, but Madagascar is number 4.

165
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,860
It's also the largest single island country.

166
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,520
85 million years ago, Madagascar was connected to India before the continent shifted, but

167
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:44,980
Sri Lanka was connected to India as recently as 1480 via a land bridge that has since eroded.

168
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,100
Sri Lanka is just north of the equator, but right on the equator is Ecuador.

169
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,860
Its capital, Quito, is only 20 miles from the equator so its day length varies by only

170
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,580
15 minutes between winter and summer, although, since the country is split by the equator,

171
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,260
winter and summer happens at the same time in the same country.

172
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,140
Ecuador is one of the 30 countries to have an Antarctic research base and right next

173
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,340
door to Ecuador's base is Peru's.

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:14,460
Copacabana—not that one, this one—in Bolivia can only be reached by driving through Peru.

175
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,540
Bolivia, despite being a landlocked country, maintains a 5,000 person navy although Mongolia,

176
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,580
also a landlocked country, maintains a navy that has one ship, a tugboat, and seven total

177
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,700
sailors.

178
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,860
Mongolia is also the least dense country on the planet with only five people per square

179
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
mile.

180
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,100
While they may seem unintimidating now, the Mongolian empire was once the largest contiguous

181
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,200
land empire in history.

182
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,900
Part of that empire was Cambodia which has changed its name six times in the last 65

183
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
years.

184
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,000
75% of Cambodia's population is Theravada Buddhist.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,040
The other major branch of Buddhism is Maya Hana Buddhism which is practiced in Japan

186
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,100
where, out of the total population of 126 million, they had three gun murders in 2012.

187
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,820
Iceland, however, can top that because they had one murder total in 2012.

188
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,620
Of course, Iceland doesn't have a huge population which makes it seem less impressive until

189
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,300
you consider that 30% of Iceland's residents own guns.

190
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,820
60% of that population, however, lives in this circle.

191
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,260
Iceland was also the first country to recognize Armenia's independence and Armenia separates

192
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,700
Azerbaijan from its Nightshivan exclave and since the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is closed,

193
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,340
residents of Nightshivan have to go all the way around Armenia to get to their own country.

194
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,900
Azerbaijan's national soccer team has played Andorras five times in the last few decades

195
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,180
and four of those games have ended in a 0-0 tie.

196
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,020
Andorra is the largest country in the world to not have an airport which is less impressive

197
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,760
when you consider that they're the 19th smallest in the world.

198
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,640
The smallest country in the world to have a major international airport is the Maldives,

199
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,320
the 8th smallest country.

200
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,140
This airport has dozens of destinations and is on a small island with no land connections

201
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,400
to other islands which means that once you land you have to either take a boat or a seaplane

202
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,860
to your destination.

203
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,200
One of the airport's destinations is Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia which is home to the world's

204
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,000
largest roundabout in Putrajaya at two miles in diameter.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,300
Malaysia is the only country connected by road to Singapore, the largest surviving city

206
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,340
state in the world.

207
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:15,540
Despite having hundreds of skyscrapers, Singapore is not the densest country in the world.

208
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,460
That title goes to Monaco which is less than one square mile large.

209
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,100
Monaco has no income tax, much like the Bahamas, which is one of two countries to have the

210
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,040
word the in its official name—the other one being the Gambia.

211
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,200
The Gambia's interesting shape comes from the flow of the river Gambia whose watershed

212
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,940
reaches all the way to Guinea which is one of three countries to have the word Guinea

213
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
in its name.

214
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,460
The other two are Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea.

215
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,260
Guinea was once the word for the entire West African region so when these countries became

216
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,460
independent from their colonizers, many chose to include Guinea in their names.

217
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,820
Equatorial Guinea's capital actually isn't on the mainland, it's on an offshore island

218
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,900
and despite its name, the equator doesn't actually intersect Equatorial Guinea, but

219
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,080
the country is on both sides of the equator since they have sovereignty over Anabon Island

220
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,660
to the south of the equator.

221
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,140
This is similar to Kiribati, a nation comprising of a few dozen islands in the Pacific.

222
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,980
Kiribati is the first place on earth to experience New Years since their time zone is UTC plus

223
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,140
14, a time zone exclusive to these islands.

224
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,540
Kiribati is close friends with Cuba since Cuba sent doctors to the islands who reduced

225
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,020
the child mortality rate by 80%.

226
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,500
Cuba, the only Caribbean island to have a commercial railroad, is one of the few remaining

227
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,940
communist states.

228
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,180
One of the others is Laos, the only landlocked country in southeast Asia, which borders Vietnam,

229
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:37,780
also communist, and the 14th most populous country in the world despite having the size

230
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,660
of about New Mexico.

231
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,720
Vietnam is good political friends with Venezuela who is not great friends with bordering Guyana

232
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,100
since Guyana thinks that the border looks like this and Venezuela thinks the border

233
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
looks like this.

234
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:53,020
Guyana, the only English speaking country in South America, borders Suriname, the smallest

235
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,660
country in South America and the only country, other than the Netherlands, whose sole primary

236
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,020
language is Dutch.

237
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:03,540
Suriname was our 98th country so that means that we're halfway through and that that's

238
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,700
the end of part one of every country in the world.

239
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,780
However, part two will be out on Tuesday December 13th so make sure you're subscribed to catch

240
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,420
that right when it comes out.
