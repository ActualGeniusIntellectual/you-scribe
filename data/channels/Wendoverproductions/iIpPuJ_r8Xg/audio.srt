1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
The United States Department of Defense is the world's largest employer, full stop.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,640
Between active-duty troops, civilian staffers, and National Guard personnel, nearly three

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,380
million employees sit on this roster, but uniquely, these staff work all around the

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,120
world on a rotating basis.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,640
The global nature of the world's best-funded military necessitates a transportation network

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,180
rivaling legitimate well-known airlines and ocean shipping companies, yet exclusively

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,980
used and experienced by those three million or so individuals employed by the US DoD.

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,940
The core of the passenger system is based here—BWI Airport between Baltimore, Maryland,

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,380
and the nation's capital, Washington, DC.

10
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,620
This is the busiest hub for the military's so-called Patriot Express airline.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,540
Nearly nightly, a flight leads to either Thule Air Base Greenland, Ramstein Air Base Germany,

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,740
and Cirlik Air Base Turkey, Kuwait International Airport, or Al Udeid Air Base Qatar.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,580
Passengers, typically DoD personnel or, if relocating to a base that allows families,

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,300
their spouses and children, check in at desks just as they do flying United, Delta, or American,

15
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,740
but with an extra-early cutoff of two hours and twenty minutes before departure.

16
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,460
They then head through regular security and go to a regular gate in Terminal E.

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,500
Next, they board through a regular jet bridge onto an aircraft operated by a member of a

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,020
unique collection of airlines.

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,380
The scale of air passenger demand by the DoD is significant enough that whole charter airlines

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,020
have arisen that are significantly, if not entirely financially reliant on operating

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,020
Patriot Express flights on behalf of the government—Alice Air, National Airlines, and Omni Air International

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,140
among them.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,940
With a goal of minimizing travel costs for the DoD, but also enabling staff outside of

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,380
combat zones to travel home more frequently on a discretionary basis, the Patriot Express

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:51,940
program lowers the relative distance between American military bases and the mainland United

26
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:56,360
States and vice versa, even to the extent of allowing a wider range of pets on board

27
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,000
than commercial airlines.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,720
The military enables this relative connectivity by operating a space-available system.

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,820
People who need to travel to get to or from their deployments get guaranteed seats booked

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,820
in advance.

31
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,220
But for staff who just want to travel for non-job reasons, they can have any seat left

32
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,900
on a flight for free just by adding their name to a list via website or app, then showing

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,180
up to the airport on the day of its departure hoping for the best.

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,140
A priority system is used to rank house hunting trips, for example, as more important than

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,160
the travel of retired but still Space A eligible veterans, and any available seats are allocated

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,700
based on this order.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,980
The system is regularly used for discretionary travel originating both from staff stationed

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,340
abroad and vice versa.

39
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,140
There are entire blogs and YouTube channels dedicated to advising eligible Space A travelers

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,780
as to the best techniques and strategies for using the system for vacations.

41
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,300
Military families regularly start their summer Europe trips by taking a Southwest flight

42
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,640
to BWI, then hoping for the best while waiting to see if they cleared the list for the evening's

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,500
flight to Ramstein Air Base.

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,820
And once they successfully make it to the other side of the Atlantic, another surprisingly

45
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,620
accommodating venture of the DoD awaits them—the Ramstein Inn.

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,540
Sitting directly opposite the Air Base's polished glass passenger terminal, the towering

47
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,260
hotel, operated by the DoD's Air Force Services Agency, offers hundreds of rooms

48
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,900
at reasonable rates only to eligible current or former DoD personnel and invited guests.

49
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,700
It's part of a large, global collection of hospitality sites offered by the United

50
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,880
States Department of Defense.

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,980
Each branch of the military operates a network of similar hotels on their bases, and some

52
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,000
purely recreational sites even exist to offer personnel at home, but especially abroad,

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,280
low-cost and American-styled rest and relaxation opportunities.

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,840
Nestled in the outskirts of Naples, Italy, for example, a mere 30-minute drive from the

55
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,600
8,000 personnel-strong Naval Support Activity Complex sits a recreation wonderland nestled

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,680
in the hollow of a dormant volcano.

57
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,700
Upon driving through the narrow gates, the view opens up to an approximate recreation

58
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,480
of a well-appointed American park, featuring an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a spattering

59
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,200
of picnic pavilions, camping sites, and rental cabins, a collection of softball, baseball,

60
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,400
football, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and paintball fields and courts, and

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,880
a wooden nine-hole golf course with a pro shop and clubhouse—a picturesque slice of

62
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,680
Italy available exclusively to military-aligned Americans.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,360
But the Patriot Express is just one aspect of the massive, global, U.S. defense transportation

64
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,600
system.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,240
The DoD ties its assets and systems together with the United States Transport Command,

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,440
headquartered at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,680
Under its banner, and co-located on the same base, is Air Mobility Command, a major command

68
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
of the U.S. Air Force.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,880
Now, Air Mobility Command does hold a massive fleet of hundreds of C-5, C-17, and C-130s,

70
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,760
and while these aircraft and their crew regularly train, provide humanitarian assistance, and

71
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,360
move some cargo through the U.S.'s global network of bases during peacetime, they primarily

72
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,320
exist for the eventuality of battlefield use.

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,480
They're not there to move regular pallets from Dover to Ramstein—they're there to

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,720
move critical, life-or-death supplies into a war zone.

75
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,840
For the more day-to-day job of supplying the DoD's global footprint, the military mostly

76
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,400
relies on commercial cargo airlines, some of which, such as Atlas Air, are the exact

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,240
same as those operating Patriot Express flights.

78
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,520
But to earn the right to this business, U.S.-flagged airlines sign up to participate in the Civil

79
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,080
Reserve Air Fleet.

80
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,680
Dozens of the country's largest airlines have committed 40% of their fleets to the

81
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,380
program, meaning should the need arise, these aircraft and four crews each would be fully

82
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,200
dedicated to military service.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,980
While the bulk of the 450 aircraft would only ever be called up in a rare, full-scale mobilization

84
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,480
of the U.S. military, smaller capacity crunches have arisen throughout the years that have

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,760
necessitated the use of the air fleet.

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,360
The fleet was first activated to transport massive numbers of troops to and from theater

87
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,820
during the opening of the Gulf and Iraq Wars, and then was used for a third time to accommodate

88
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:01,000
the massive numbers of refugees airlifted out of Kabul during the final days of America's

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,760
withdrawal from Afghanistan.

90
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,720
The very aircraft that carried the general public each and every day to, from, and within

91
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,720
the U.S. were sent as far as Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar to transport evacuees to intermediary

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,620
stops at American bases in Europe, and eventually the U.S. where other, short-haul Civil Reserve

93
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,940
Air Fleet aircraft shuttle them to their final destinations within the country.

94
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,900
In exchange for prioritizing their fleet for whatever the DoD deems necessary, these

95
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,580
same airlines get priority in receiving a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars

96
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,100
in annual DoD passenger and cargo transportation contracts.

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
But air cargo needs in peacetime are relatively minimal, because little is regularly time-sensitive

98
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,420
enough to justify its additional cost over more traditional means of freight transport.

99
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,140
The key with this system, and nearly all aspects of the defense transportation system, is that

100
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,420
it's designed around the recognition that, at any moment, the world could change in a

101
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,820
way that necessitates, or at least leads to, a massive mobilization of the U.S. military,

102
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,320
and therefore a massive mobilization of its people and supplies.

103
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,740
When that does occur, the DoD largely leans on the full capacity of its Patriot Express

104
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,780
operators, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and its own aircraft to get fighters to the front

105
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,780
lines.

106
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,940
But getting soldiers to far-flung conflict areas is only half the battle—they need

107
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,040
supplies, and moving everything from trucks and ammunition to bedrolls and toilet paper

108
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,140
across the world by air is anything but efficient.

109
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:30,580
So rather than shipping an armored Humvee from South Bend, Indiana to Kabul, Afghanistan,

110
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,580
or a tank part from Lima, Ohio to Camp Carroll, South Korea, members of the armed forces simply

111
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:40,660
pull them from a regional stockpile that has been carefully built up and positioned years

112
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,100
in advance.

113
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,620
One of the earliest advantages a country can gain in a conflict is control of the skies,

114
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,180
as this can help protect and optimize operations on the ground.

115
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,260
Therefore, setting up a functional in-theater airbase is high in the order of operations,

116
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,460
which is why the Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources Program exists.

117
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,220
An airbase involves a lot more than a runway, but thanks to the BEAR program, the U.S. Air

118
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,460
Force can quickly build one out of just a runway.

119
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,260
Once that's acquired, either peacefully or through force, the military can start flying

120
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,000
in BEAR resources from their storage locations around the world on standard C-17 cargo planes.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,060
These resources are all pre-packaged and ready for transport so they can go out at a moment's

122
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,560
notice, and are specifically designed for rapid aircraft transport.

123
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,980
Each package of resources is roughly designed to accommodate 250 people so that if the base

124
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:35,220
is going to accommodate around 1,000 personnel, for example, they just have to multiply the

125
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,220
basic configuration by four.

126
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:43,260
These are organized into Unit Type Codes, or UTCs, that group individual supplies based

127
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,140
on their intended use.

128
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,160
For example, a BEAR deployment's foundational configuration includes the XFA-14 Combat Air

129
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,460
Force's initial UTC, which is composed of eight small shelters, eight medium shelters,

130
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,020
eight 25-kilowatt power distribution panels, 16 fire extinguishers, two sets of miscellaneous

131
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,340
spare parts, one generator, and one set of generator wheels.

132
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,240
Other foundational UTCs would also get sent out first, like XFA-17 Water Distribution

133
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,480
Initial, XFA-3C Mobility Air Forces Initial, and XFA-LS Self-Help Laundry, which includes

134
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,380
two small shelters, ten washers, ten dryers, four water heaters, four fire extinguishers,

135
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,440
and all the necessary plumbing and electrical supplies.

136
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,880
But others are designed to augment the base kit and only go out when needed, like XFA-CW,

137
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,640
which acts as a cold weather kit, including twelve 103k heaters, twelve exhaust pipes,

138
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,560
and twenty-four air ducts.

139
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,680
Each individual BEAR resource is designed to be assembled quickly—then offer building

140
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,120
a permanent airbase, therefore quickly cobbling one together when the need is most pressing.

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,480
For example, the small shelter system is rated for 90-minute assembly by a team of six, the

142
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,040
massive cavernous large area maintenance shelter can go up with ten people in 30 hours, while

143
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,060
the single-pallet expeditionary kitchen can start cooking for hundreds after just 90 minutes

144
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,900
of assembly by four people.

145
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,220
By adding on more and more UTCs, the military can build out an airbase with functions like

146
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,740
postal service, firefighting, chaplain services, water treatment, mortuary services, maintenance

147
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,020
operations, and more within a matter of days.

148
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,360
But the Air Force's advanced bases-in-a-box are only one example of how the military prepares

149
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,080
for transport constraints on the day a war breaks out.

150
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,500
In order to project power, supply fighting forces in days rather than weeks, and rapidly

151
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,680
set a theater, the US Army has stashed thousands of vehicles, weapons, and general supplies

152
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:37,140
in seven separate Army Prepositioned Stocks, or APSs, and these stocks are massive.

153
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,860
Take for example, APS-5, located at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.

154
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,400
Overseen by the 401st Army Field Support Brigade and a cog in American conflicts in the Middle

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,420
East since the 1990s, the stockpile effectively allows the US to enter a regional battlefield

156
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,940
in a matter of days, and sustain the battle for a matter of months.

157
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:01,260
One of the Army's largest physical operations, APS-5 stocks equipment for strategic abilities,

158
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,900
reserve vehicles and munitions to replace those broken and consumed on the battlefront,

159
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,820
and the supplies required to outfit an armored brigade combat team, an infantry brigade combat

160
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,180
team, a sustainment brigade, a fires brigade, a medical support element set, and an army

161
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:21,380
watercraft set—effectively, $5.5 billion worth of materials just in brigade sets.

162
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,200
With so much gear, the 401st Army Field Support Brigade's time is entirely occupied by the

163
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,340
regular maintenance on the thousands of Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and the

164
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,420
rest of the fleet stored in the 120-degree heat along with testing and repairing weapons

165
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,580
stashed in climate-controlled warehouses to ensure their effectiveness should the need

166
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,780
arise.

167
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,980
If something were to boil over in the Middle East, it's expected that APS-5 can mobilize

168
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,340
an entire armored brigade combat team, a fighting force made up of 5,000 people, and a staggering

169
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,100
302 vehicles in just 96 hours.

170
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,940
But the Army's APSs aren't only impressive in their sheer scale and organization—they're

171
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,580
also impressive in their flexibility and adaptability, as one of their most critical preposition

172
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,180
stock operations isn't even land-based—it floats.

173
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,260
Bolstering APS-5 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in the 2000s,

174
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:20,060
and increasingly visible in the Pacific today, is the Army's APS-3—an assortment of 10-16

175
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,940
cargo-carrying ships.

176
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,380
At the core of APS-3 are two container ships—the MV Staff Sergeant Edward A. Carter Jr., an

177
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:34,260
MV LTC John U.D. Page, and five large government-owned cargo ships with roll-on-roll-off capabilities

178
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,340
that simplify unloading large, oversized vehicles and downloading in ports with limited infrastructure.

179
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,180
With the size and organization of this fleet changes based on need and location, APS-3

180
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,700
carries much of what land-based prepositioning stocks would—20,000 tons of munitions are

181
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:53,420
stored on container ships and up to two brigades or over 1,000 tracked and wheeled vehicles

182
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,700
worth of combat equipment are spread across the rest of the fleet.

183
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,420
Yet, while the Army's floating preposition stock proved invaluable in past conflicts

184
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,900
and helps project power in the Pacific today, it's the outlier in terms of its mobility,

185
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,100
as the Army has prioritized size in its prepositioning strategy.

186
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,880
The Navy, on the other hand, whose role in conflict is more expeditionary than sustained,

187
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,780
has leaned heavily into the flexibility afforded by prepositioning through floating stockpiles.

188
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,000
The Navy's prepositioning program is all about readiness, and to be closest to potential

189
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,760
conflict zones, their 14 maritime prepositioning ships are spread across three squadrons in

190
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,360
the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the Western Pacific.

191
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,560
Like the Army, the Navy relies on large, medium-speed roll-on-roll-off ships, and each of the three

192
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,800
squadrons is designed to supply and sustain a Marine Expeditionary Brigade for 30 days,

193
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,720
which is no small task considering its size as a 17,000 person unit with ground, sea,

194
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
and air capabilities.

195
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,500
In a service that's built around rapid response, this maritime prepositioning force is able

196
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,480
to mobilize at a moment's notice, and provide supplies and operational support to amphibious

197
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,540
units already on the ground, while also kitting out Marines and Sailors being flown in from

198
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,000
around the world.

199
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,880
These capabilities are of increasing value to the DoD, as modern warfare has pivoted

200
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,240
away from massive ground wars, and at the same time the Pacific, with its tiny islands

201
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,120
and massive expanses of open water, has become an area of increasing concern for the US.

202
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,960
Prepositioning is incredibly valuable to the Air Force, Army, and Navy for its ability

203
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,520
to position each and remote battlefields quicker than any other fighting force.

204
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,540
It's also incredibly valuable in what it doesn't do—necessitate the immediate mobilization

205
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,540
of America's shipping power the second a conflict arises.

206
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,280
This helps protect against, or at least soften a surge in seal of demand when the US goes

207
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
to war.

208
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,520
And that only lasts so long.

209
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:49,480
For longer, drawn-out conflicts, armed forces need sealift to keep the supplies coming for

210
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,800
months and years.

211
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,480
This responsibility falls directly on the shoulders of US Transcom's Military Sealift

212
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,520
Command.

213
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:03,580
Of the roughly 120 vessels either owned or contracted by Sealift Command, these 32 provide

214
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,960
direct fleet support for deployed Navy forces, whether it be tankers replenishing fuel reserves

215
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,160
or cargo ships providing foodstuffs.

216
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,560
Now, in the event that more vessels are needed in a shipping surge, Sealift Command will

217
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,420
activate the 40-Plus Ready Reserve Force—a collection of old, government-owned ships

218
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:27,060
sitting inactive across American ports—some of which are so old they're actually steam-powered.

219
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,600
In addition to the emergency capacity available through the RRF, the US military also has

220
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,260
the Merchant Marine—a fleet of American-flagged private merchant ships that serve as auxiliary

221
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,620
cargo and people-moving resources along commercial trade routes for the Navy during peacetime

222
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,620
and war.

223
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,940
And it's directly here where some of the most pressing limitations to the US military's

224
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,200
transportation systems lie—in the inability to handle the surge and move major troop numbers

225
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,460
and supplies far afield.

226
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,140
Today, the ocean-going, privately-owned merchant fleet in the US is only 181 ships—a far

227
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,820
cry from the 565 in 1982.

228
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,320
Though design advances have increased storage capacity, the available deadweight tonnage

229
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,840
is only a fraction of what it was in the 80s and 90s.

230
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,900
And making things worse, in a 2019 test of preparedness of the Ready Reserve Force, only

231
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,380
41% of the available seal of capacity was actually ocean-ready—the expectation prior

232
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,060
had been that some 85% of the vessels would be fit for sea.

233
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,420
But despite those challenges, the United States military is commonly and objectively recognized

234
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,380
as the world's greatest fighting force, and while that does relate to its massive

235
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,380
budget, global presence, and the actual skill of its fighting forces, nothing can happen

236
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,180
without the system that moves its people and equipment to where they're used.

237
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,840
Logistics power is military power, and so it's no wonder why the US DoD has put so

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,940
much funding and focus into its transportation system—it's a practical necessity during

239
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,340
peacetime and the very foundation of American military power abroad.

240
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,060
Another logistics marvel is the system behind grocery stores, but it's rather antiquated.

241
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,860
Distributors ship goods to a grocery store, then you search through to hopefully find

242
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:11,340
roughly the right amount of what you need.

243
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:15,860
HelloFresh innovates upon that model, shipping what you need, in the exact quantity you need,

244
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,300
directly to you.

245
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,320
You use their app or website to select one of 30 different meal options each week, then

246
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,600
all their ingredients show up on your doorstep in an insulated ice-packed box—they even

247
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,220
change the amount of ice and type of insulation depending on the temperature of the shipping

248
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,340
route and destination.

249
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,580
Next you get cooking with the instructions on the provided recipe card, but the cooking

250
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,060
goes quicker than average since you don't have to deal with measuring and certain ingredients

251
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,300
are pre-prepared.

252
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,780
That way you can make a delicious home-cooked meal in 30 or so minutes without shopping

253
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,780
time.

254
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,680
Personally, it really allows me to fit more cooking into my busy schedule, and avoid ordering

255
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,020
expensive delivery food or eating unhealthy frozen meals.

256
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,460
That's why I've been using them for the better part of three years now, since long

257
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,580
before they became a sponsor, and regularly order my favorites like these firecracker

258
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,740
meatballs.

259
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,700
All around, HelloFresh is a better way to eat, and it's often cheaper too, especially

260
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,340
since you can click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER65

261
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,900
for 65% off plus free shipping.
