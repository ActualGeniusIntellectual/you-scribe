00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
The United States Department of Defense is the world's largest employer, full stop.

00:06.080 --> 00:10.640
Between active-duty troops, civilian staffers, and National Guard personnel, nearly three

00:10.640 --> 00:15.380
million employees sit on this roster, but uniquely, these staff work all around the

00:15.380 --> 00:18.120
world on a rotating basis.

00:18.120 --> 00:22.640
The global nature of the world's best-funded military necessitates a transportation network

00:22.640 --> 00:27.180
rivaling legitimate well-known airlines and ocean shipping companies, yet exclusively

00:27.180 --> 00:32.980
used and experienced by those three million or so individuals employed by the US DoD.

00:32.980 --> 00:37.940
The core of the passenger system is based here—BWI Airport between Baltimore, Maryland,

00:37.940 --> 00:41.380
and the nation's capital, Washington, DC.

00:41.380 --> 00:46.620
This is the busiest hub for the military's so-called Patriot Express airline.

00:46.620 --> 00:51.540
Nearly nightly, a flight leads to either Thule Air Base Greenland, Ramstein Air Base Germany,

00:51.540 --> 00:56.740
and Cirlik Air Base Turkey, Kuwait International Airport, or Al Udeid Air Base Qatar.

00:56.740 --> 01:01.580
Passengers, typically DoD personnel or, if relocating to a base that allows families,

01:01.580 --> 01:06.300
their spouses and children, check in at desks just as they do flying United, Delta, or American,

01:06.300 --> 01:10.740
but with an extra-early cutoff of two hours and twenty minutes before departure.

01:10.740 --> 01:14.460
They then head through regular security and go to a regular gate in Terminal E.

01:14.460 --> 01:19.500
Next, they board through a regular jet bridge onto an aircraft operated by a member of a

01:19.500 --> 01:22.020
unique collection of airlines.

01:22.020 --> 01:27.380
The scale of air passenger demand by the DoD is significant enough that whole charter airlines

01:27.380 --> 01:32.020
have arisen that are significantly, if not entirely financially reliant on operating

01:32.020 --> 01:38.020
Patriot Express flights on behalf of the government—Alice Air, National Airlines, and Omni Air International

01:38.020 --> 01:39.140
among them.

01:39.140 --> 01:42.940
With a goal of minimizing travel costs for the DoD, but also enabling staff outside of

01:42.940 --> 01:47.380
combat zones to travel home more frequently on a discretionary basis, the Patriot Express

01:47.380 --> 01:51.940
program lowers the relative distance between American military bases and the mainland United

01:51.940 --> 01:56.360
States and vice versa, even to the extent of allowing a wider range of pets on board

01:56.360 --> 01:58.000
than commercial airlines.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.720
The military enables this relative connectivity by operating a space-available system.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.820
People who need to travel to get to or from their deployments get guaranteed seats booked

02:07.820 --> 02:08.820
in advance.

02:08.820 --> 02:13.220
But for staff who just want to travel for non-job reasons, they can have any seat left

02:13.220 --> 02:17.900
on a flight for free just by adding their name to a list via website or app, then showing

02:17.900 --> 02:21.180
up to the airport on the day of its departure hoping for the best.

02:21.180 --> 02:25.140
A priority system is used to rank house hunting trips, for example, as more important than

02:25.140 --> 02:30.160
the travel of retired but still Space A eligible veterans, and any available seats are allocated

02:30.160 --> 02:31.700
based on this order.

02:31.700 --> 02:35.980
The system is regularly used for discretionary travel originating both from staff stationed

02:35.980 --> 02:38.340
abroad and vice versa.

02:38.340 --> 02:43.140
There are entire blogs and YouTube channels dedicated to advising eligible Space A travelers

02:43.140 --> 02:47.780
as to the best techniques and strategies for using the system for vacations.

02:47.780 --> 02:51.300
Military families regularly start their summer Europe trips by taking a Southwest flight

02:51.300 --> 02:55.640
to BWI, then hoping for the best while waiting to see if they cleared the list for the evening's

02:55.640 --> 02:57.500
flight to Ramstein Air Base.

02:57.500 --> 03:01.820
And once they successfully make it to the other side of the Atlantic, another surprisingly

03:01.820 --> 03:06.620
accommodating venture of the DoD awaits them—the Ramstein Inn.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.540
Sitting directly opposite the Air Base's polished glass passenger terminal, the towering

03:10.540 --> 03:15.260
hotel, operated by the DoD's Air Force Services Agency, offers hundreds of rooms

03:15.260 --> 03:20.900
at reasonable rates only to eligible current or former DoD personnel and invited guests.

03:20.900 --> 03:25.700
It's part of a large, global collection of hospitality sites offered by the United

03:25.700 --> 03:27.880
States Department of Defense.

03:27.880 --> 03:31.980
Each branch of the military operates a network of similar hotels on their bases, and some

03:31.980 --> 03:37.000
purely recreational sites even exist to offer personnel at home, but especially abroad,

03:37.000 --> 03:41.280
low-cost and American-styled rest and relaxation opportunities.

03:41.280 --> 03:44.840
Nestled in the outskirts of Naples, Italy, for example, a mere 30-minute drive from the

03:44.840 --> 03:50.600
8,000 personnel-strong Naval Support Activity Complex sits a recreation wonderland nestled

03:50.600 --> 03:53.680
in the hollow of a dormant volcano.

03:53.680 --> 03:57.700
Upon driving through the narrow gates, the view opens up to an approximate recreation

03:57.700 --> 04:02.480
of a well-appointed American park, featuring an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a spattering

04:02.480 --> 04:07.200
of picnic pavilions, camping sites, and rental cabins, a collection of softball, baseball,

04:07.200 --> 04:11.400
football, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and paintball fields and courts, and

04:11.400 --> 04:15.880
a wooden nine-hole golf course with a pro shop and clubhouse—a picturesque slice of

04:15.880 --> 04:19.680
Italy available exclusively to military-aligned Americans.

04:19.680 --> 04:26.360
But the Patriot Express is just one aspect of the massive, global, U.S. defense transportation

04:26.360 --> 04:27.600
system.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.240
The DoD ties its assets and systems together with the United States Transport Command,

04:32.240 --> 04:35.440
headquartered at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.

04:35.440 --> 04:40.680
Under its banner, and co-located on the same base, is Air Mobility Command, a major command

04:40.680 --> 04:42.200
of the U.S. Air Force.

04:42.200 --> 04:48.880
Now, Air Mobility Command does hold a massive fleet of hundreds of C-5, C-17, and C-130s,

04:48.880 --> 04:52.760
and while these aircraft and their crew regularly train, provide humanitarian assistance, and

04:52.760 --> 04:57.360
move some cargo through the U.S.'s global network of bases during peacetime, they primarily

04:57.360 --> 05:00.320
exist for the eventuality of battlefield use.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.480
They're not there to move regular pallets from Dover to Ramstein—they're there to

05:04.480 --> 05:08.720
move critical, life-or-death supplies into a war zone.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.840
For the more day-to-day job of supplying the DoD's global footprint, the military mostly

05:12.840 --> 05:17.400
relies on commercial cargo airlines, some of which, such as Atlas Air, are the exact

05:17.400 --> 05:20.240
same as those operating Patriot Express flights.

05:20.240 --> 05:24.520
But to earn the right to this business, U.S.-flagged airlines sign up to participate in the Civil

05:24.520 --> 05:26.080
Reserve Air Fleet.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.680
Dozens of the country's largest airlines have committed 40% of their fleets to the

05:29.680 --> 05:34.380
program, meaning should the need arise, these aircraft and four crews each would be fully

05:34.380 --> 05:37.200
dedicated to military service.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.980
While the bulk of the 450 aircraft would only ever be called up in a rare, full-scale mobilization

05:41.980 --> 05:46.480
of the U.S. military, smaller capacity crunches have arisen throughout the years that have

05:46.480 --> 05:48.760
necessitated the use of the air fleet.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.360
The fleet was first activated to transport massive numbers of troops to and from theater

05:52.360 --> 05:56.820
during the opening of the Gulf and Iraq Wars, and then was used for a third time to accommodate

05:56.820 --> 06:01.000
the massive numbers of refugees airlifted out of Kabul during the final days of America's

06:01.000 --> 06:02.760
withdrawal from Afghanistan.

06:02.760 --> 06:06.720
The very aircraft that carried the general public each and every day to, from, and within

06:06.720 --> 06:11.720
the U.S. were sent as far as Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar to transport evacuees to intermediary

06:11.720 --> 06:16.620
stops at American bases in Europe, and eventually the U.S. where other, short-haul Civil Reserve

06:16.620 --> 06:20.940
Air Fleet aircraft shuttle them to their final destinations within the country.

06:20.940 --> 06:24.900
In exchange for prioritizing their fleet for whatever the DoD deems necessary, these

06:24.900 --> 06:29.580
same airlines get priority in receiving a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars

06:29.580 --> 06:34.100
in annual DoD passenger and cargo transportation contracts.

06:34.100 --> 06:39.100
But air cargo needs in peacetime are relatively minimal, because little is regularly time-sensitive

06:39.100 --> 06:44.420
enough to justify its additional cost over more traditional means of freight transport.

06:44.420 --> 06:49.140
The key with this system, and nearly all aspects of the defense transportation system, is that

06:49.140 --> 06:53.420
it's designed around the recognition that, at any moment, the world could change in a

06:53.420 --> 06:58.820
way that necessitates, or at least leads to, a massive mobilization of the U.S. military,

06:58.820 --> 07:03.320
and therefore a massive mobilization of its people and supplies.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.740
When that does occur, the DoD largely leans on the full capacity of its Patriot Express

07:07.740 --> 07:12.780
operators, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and its own aircraft to get fighters to the front

07:12.780 --> 07:13.780
lines.

07:13.780 --> 07:17.940
But getting soldiers to far-flung conflict areas is only half the battle—they need

07:17.940 --> 07:22.040
supplies, and moving everything from trucks and ammunition to bedrolls and toilet paper

07:22.040 --> 07:26.140
across the world by air is anything but efficient.

07:26.140 --> 07:30.580
So rather than shipping an armored Humvee from South Bend, Indiana to Kabul, Afghanistan,

07:30.580 --> 07:35.580
or a tank part from Lima, Ohio to Camp Carroll, South Korea, members of the armed forces simply

07:35.580 --> 07:40.660
pull them from a regional stockpile that has been carefully built up and positioned years

07:40.660 --> 07:42.100
in advance.

07:42.100 --> 07:46.620
One of the earliest advantages a country can gain in a conflict is control of the skies,

07:46.620 --> 07:50.180
as this can help protect and optimize operations on the ground.

07:50.180 --> 07:55.260
Therefore, setting up a functional in-theater airbase is high in the order of operations,

07:55.260 --> 08:00.460
which is why the Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources Program exists.

08:00.460 --> 08:05.220
An airbase involves a lot more than a runway, but thanks to the BEAR program, the U.S. Air

08:05.220 --> 08:08.460
Force can quickly build one out of just a runway.

08:08.460 --> 08:12.260
Once that's acquired, either peacefully or through force, the military can start flying

08:12.260 --> 08:18.000
in BEAR resources from their storage locations around the world on standard C-17 cargo planes.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.060
These resources are all pre-packaged and ready for transport so they can go out at a moment's

08:22.060 --> 08:26.560
notice, and are specifically designed for rapid aircraft transport.

08:26.560 --> 08:30.980
Each package of resources is roughly designed to accommodate 250 people so that if the base

08:30.980 --> 08:35.220
is going to accommodate around 1,000 personnel, for example, they just have to multiply the

08:35.220 --> 08:38.220
basic configuration by four.

08:38.220 --> 08:43.260
These are organized into Unit Type Codes, or UTCs, that group individual supplies based

08:43.260 --> 08:45.140
on their intended use.

08:45.140 --> 08:50.160
For example, a BEAR deployment's foundational configuration includes the XFA-14 Combat Air

08:50.160 --> 08:55.460
Force's initial UTC, which is composed of eight small shelters, eight medium shelters,

08:55.460 --> 09:00.020
eight 25-kilowatt power distribution panels, 16 fire extinguishers, two sets of miscellaneous

09:00.020 --> 09:04.340
spare parts, one generator, and one set of generator wheels.

09:04.340 --> 09:09.240
Other foundational UTCs would also get sent out first, like XFA-17 Water Distribution

09:09.240 --> 09:15.480
Initial, XFA-3C Mobility Air Forces Initial, and XFA-LS Self-Help Laundry, which includes

09:15.480 --> 09:20.380
two small shelters, ten washers, ten dryers, four water heaters, four fire extinguishers,

09:20.380 --> 09:23.440
and all the necessary plumbing and electrical supplies.

09:23.440 --> 09:27.880
But others are designed to augment the base kit and only go out when needed, like XFA-CW,

09:27.880 --> 09:32.640
which acts as a cold weather kit, including twelve 103k heaters, twelve exhaust pipes,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.560
and twenty-four air ducts.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.680
Each individual BEAR resource is designed to be assembled quickly—then offer building

09:38.680 --> 09:44.120
a permanent airbase, therefore quickly cobbling one together when the need is most pressing.

09:44.120 --> 09:48.480
For example, the small shelter system is rated for 90-minute assembly by a team of six, the

09:48.480 --> 09:53.040
massive cavernous large area maintenance shelter can go up with ten people in 30 hours, while

09:53.040 --> 09:57.060
the single-pallet expeditionary kitchen can start cooking for hundreds after just 90 minutes

09:57.060 --> 09:58.900
of assembly by four people.

09:58.900 --> 10:03.220
By adding on more and more UTCs, the military can build out an airbase with functions like

10:03.220 --> 10:07.740
postal service, firefighting, chaplain services, water treatment, mortuary services, maintenance

10:07.740 --> 10:11.020
operations, and more within a matter of days.

10:11.020 --> 10:16.360
But the Air Force's advanced bases-in-a-box are only one example of how the military prepares

10:16.360 --> 10:20.080
for transport constraints on the day a war breaks out.

10:20.080 --> 10:24.500
In order to project power, supply fighting forces in days rather than weeks, and rapidly

10:24.500 --> 10:29.680
set a theater, the US Army has stashed thousands of vehicles, weapons, and general supplies

10:29.680 --> 10:37.140
in seven separate Army Prepositioned Stocks, or APSs, and these stocks are massive.

10:37.140 --> 10:41.860
Take for example, APS-5, located at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.

10:41.860 --> 10:46.400
Overseen by the 401st Army Field Support Brigade and a cog in American conflicts in the Middle

10:46.400 --> 10:51.420
East since the 1990s, the stockpile effectively allows the US to enter a regional battlefield

10:51.420 --> 10:55.940
in a matter of days, and sustain the battle for a matter of months.

10:55.940 --> 11:01.260
One of the Army's largest physical operations, APS-5 stocks equipment for strategic abilities,

11:01.260 --> 11:04.900
reserve vehicles and munitions to replace those broken and consumed on the battlefront,

11:04.900 --> 11:09.820
and the supplies required to outfit an armored brigade combat team, an infantry brigade combat

11:09.820 --> 11:14.180
team, a sustainment brigade, a fires brigade, a medical support element set, and an army

11:14.180 --> 11:21.380
watercraft set—effectively, $5.5 billion worth of materials just in brigade sets.

11:21.380 --> 11:27.200
With so much gear, the 401st Army Field Support Brigade's time is entirely occupied by the

11:27.200 --> 11:31.340
regular maintenance on the thousands of Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and the

11:31.340 --> 11:35.420
rest of the fleet stored in the 120-degree heat along with testing and repairing weapons

11:35.420 --> 11:39.580
stashed in climate-controlled warehouses to ensure their effectiveness should the need

11:39.580 --> 11:40.780
arise.

11:40.780 --> 11:44.980
If something were to boil over in the Middle East, it's expected that APS-5 can mobilize

11:44.980 --> 11:50.340
an entire armored brigade combat team, a fighting force made up of 5,000 people, and a staggering

11:50.340 --> 11:54.100
302 vehicles in just 96 hours.

11:54.100 --> 11:59.940
But the Army's APSs aren't only impressive in their sheer scale and organization—they're

11:59.940 --> 12:04.580
also impressive in their flexibility and adaptability, as one of their most critical preposition

12:04.580 --> 12:09.180
stock operations isn't even land-based—it floats.

12:09.180 --> 12:14.260
Bolstering APS-5 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in the 2000s,

12:14.260 --> 12:20.060
and increasingly visible in the Pacific today, is the Army's APS-3—an assortment of 10-16

12:20.580 --> 12:22.940
cargo-carrying ships.

12:22.940 --> 12:28.380
At the core of APS-3 are two container ships—the MV Staff Sergeant Edward A. Carter Jr., an

12:28.380 --> 12:34.260
MV LTC John U.D. Page, and five large government-owned cargo ships with roll-on-roll-off capabilities

12:34.260 --> 12:39.340
that simplify unloading large, oversized vehicles and downloading in ports with limited infrastructure.

12:39.340 --> 12:44.180
With the size and organization of this fleet changes based on need and location, APS-3

12:44.180 --> 12:48.700
carries much of what land-based prepositioning stocks would—20,000 tons of munitions are

12:48.700 --> 12:53.420
stored on container ships and up to two brigades or over 1,000 tracked and wheeled vehicles

12:53.420 --> 12:56.700
worth of combat equipment are spread across the rest of the fleet.

12:56.700 --> 13:01.420
Yet, while the Army's floating preposition stock proved invaluable in past conflicts

13:01.420 --> 13:05.900
and helps project power in the Pacific today, it's the outlier in terms of its mobility,

13:05.900 --> 13:10.100
as the Army has prioritized size in its prepositioning strategy.

13:10.100 --> 13:14.880
The Navy, on the other hand, whose role in conflict is more expeditionary than sustained,

13:14.880 --> 13:19.780
has leaned heavily into the flexibility afforded by prepositioning through floating stockpiles.

13:19.780 --> 13:24.000
The Navy's prepositioning program is all about readiness, and to be closest to potential

13:24.000 --> 13:28.760
conflict zones, their 14 maritime prepositioning ships are spread across three squadrons in

13:28.760 --> 13:32.360
the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the Western Pacific.

13:32.360 --> 13:37.560
Like the Army, the Navy relies on large, medium-speed roll-on-roll-off ships, and each of the three

13:37.560 --> 13:42.800
squadrons is designed to supply and sustain a Marine Expeditionary Brigade for 30 days,

13:42.800 --> 13:48.720
which is no small task considering its size as a 17,000 person unit with ground, sea,

13:48.720 --> 13:49.720
and air capabilities.

13:49.720 --> 13:54.500
In a service that's built around rapid response, this maritime prepositioning force is able

13:54.500 --> 13:58.480
to mobilize at a moment's notice, and provide supplies and operational support to amphibious

13:58.480 --> 14:02.540
units already on the ground, while also kitting out Marines and Sailors being flown in from

14:02.540 --> 14:04.000
around the world.

14:04.000 --> 14:07.880
These capabilities are of increasing value to the DoD, as modern warfare has pivoted

14:07.880 --> 14:12.240
away from massive ground wars, and at the same time the Pacific, with its tiny islands

14:12.240 --> 14:18.120
and massive expanses of open water, has become an area of increasing concern for the US.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.960
Prepositioning is incredibly valuable to the Air Force, Army, and Navy for its ability

14:21.960 --> 14:26.520
to position each and remote battlefields quicker than any other fighting force.

14:26.520 --> 14:31.540
It's also incredibly valuable in what it doesn't do—necessitate the immediate mobilization

14:31.540 --> 14:35.540
of America's shipping power the second a conflict arises.

14:35.540 --> 14:40.280
This helps protect against, or at least soften a surge in seal of demand when the US goes

14:40.280 --> 14:41.280
to war.

14:41.320 --> 14:44.520
And that only lasts so long.

14:44.520 --> 14:49.480
For longer, drawn-out conflicts, armed forces need sealift to keep the supplies coming for

14:49.480 --> 14:51.800
months and years.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.480
This responsibility falls directly on the shoulders of US Transcom's Military Sealift

14:56.480 --> 14:57.520
Command.

14:57.520 --> 15:03.580
Of the roughly 120 vessels either owned or contracted by Sealift Command, these 32 provide

15:03.580 --> 15:08.960
direct fleet support for deployed Navy forces, whether it be tankers replenishing fuel reserves

15:08.960 --> 15:11.160
or cargo ships providing foodstuffs.

15:11.160 --> 15:15.560
Now, in the event that more vessels are needed in a shipping surge, Sealift Command will

15:15.560 --> 15:20.420
activate the 40-Plus Ready Reserve Force—a collection of old, government-owned ships

15:20.420 --> 15:27.060
sitting inactive across American ports—some of which are so old they're actually steam-powered.

15:27.060 --> 15:31.600
In addition to the emergency capacity available through the RRF, the US military also has

15:31.600 --> 15:36.260
the Merchant Marine—a fleet of American-flagged private merchant ships that serve as auxiliary

15:36.260 --> 15:40.620
cargo and people-moving resources along commercial trade routes for the Navy during peacetime

15:40.620 --> 15:41.620
and war.

15:41.620 --> 15:45.940
And it's directly here where some of the most pressing limitations to the US military's

15:45.940 --> 15:51.200
transportation systems lie—in the inability to handle the surge and move major troop numbers

15:51.200 --> 15:53.460
and supplies far afield.

15:53.460 --> 15:59.140
Today, the ocean-going, privately-owned merchant fleet in the US is only 181 ships—a far

15:59.140 --> 16:02.820
cry from the 565 in 1982.

16:02.820 --> 16:06.320
Though design advances have increased storage capacity, the available deadweight tonnage

16:06.320 --> 16:09.840
is only a fraction of what it was in the 80s and 90s.

16:09.840 --> 16:14.900
And making things worse, in a 2019 test of preparedness of the Ready Reserve Force, only

16:14.900 --> 16:20.380
41% of the available seal of capacity was actually ocean-ready—the expectation prior

16:20.380 --> 16:24.060
had been that some 85% of the vessels would be fit for sea.

16:24.060 --> 16:29.420
But despite those challenges, the United States military is commonly and objectively recognized

16:29.420 --> 16:33.380
as the world's greatest fighting force, and while that does relate to its massive

16:33.380 --> 16:38.380
budget, global presence, and the actual skill of its fighting forces, nothing can happen

16:38.380 --> 16:43.180
without the system that moves its people and equipment to where they're used.

16:43.180 --> 16:47.840
Logistics power is military power, and so it's no wonder why the US DoD has put so

16:47.840 --> 16:52.940
much funding and focus into its transportation system—it's a practical necessity during

16:52.940 --> 16:59.340
peacetime and the very foundation of American military power abroad.

17:00.260 --> 17:05.060
Another logistics marvel is the system behind grocery stores, but it's rather antiquated.

17:05.060 --> 17:08.860
Distributors ship goods to a grocery store, then you search through to hopefully find

17:08.860 --> 17:11.340
roughly the right amount of what you need.

17:11.340 --> 17:15.860
HelloFresh innovates upon that model, shipping what you need, in the exact quantity you need,

17:15.860 --> 17:17.300
directly to you.

17:17.300 --> 17:21.320
You use their app or website to select one of 30 different meal options each week, then

17:21.320 --> 17:25.600
all their ingredients show up on your doorstep in an insulated ice-packed box—they even

17:25.600 --> 17:29.220
change the amount of ice and type of insulation depending on the temperature of the shipping

17:29.220 --> 17:31.340
route and destination.

17:31.340 --> 17:34.580
Next you get cooking with the instructions on the provided recipe card, but the cooking

17:34.580 --> 17:38.060
goes quicker than average since you don't have to deal with measuring and certain ingredients

17:38.060 --> 17:39.300
are pre-prepared.

17:39.300 --> 17:43.780
That way you can make a delicious home-cooked meal in 30 or so minutes without shopping

17:43.780 --> 17:44.780
time.

17:44.780 --> 17:48.680
Personally, it really allows me to fit more cooking into my busy schedule, and avoid ordering

17:48.680 --> 17:52.020
expensive delivery food or eating unhealthy frozen meals.

17:52.020 --> 17:55.460
That's why I've been using them for the better part of three years now, since long

17:55.460 --> 17:59.580
before they became a sponsor, and regularly order my favorites like these firecracker

17:59.580 --> 18:00.740
meatballs.

18:00.740 --> 18:04.700
All around, HelloFresh is a better way to eat, and it's often cheaper too, especially

18:04.700 --> 18:09.340
since you can click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER65

18:09.340 --> 18:11.900
