0	6080	The United States Department of Defense is the world's largest employer, full stop.
6080	10640	Between active-duty troops, civilian staffers, and National Guard personnel, nearly three
10640	15380	million employees sit on this roster, but uniquely, these staff work all around the
15380	18120	world on a rotating basis.
18120	22640	The global nature of the world's best-funded military necessitates a transportation network
22640	27180	rivaling legitimate well-known airlines and ocean shipping companies, yet exclusively
27180	32980	used and experienced by those three million or so individuals employed by the US DoD.
32980	37940	The core of the passenger system is based here—BWI Airport between Baltimore, Maryland,
37940	41380	and the nation's capital, Washington, DC.
41380	46620	This is the busiest hub for the military's so-called Patriot Express airline.
46620	51540	Nearly nightly, a flight leads to either Thule Air Base Greenland, Ramstein Air Base Germany,
51540	56740	and Cirlik Air Base Turkey, Kuwait International Airport, or Al Udeid Air Base Qatar.
56740	61580	Passengers, typically DoD personnel or, if relocating to a base that allows families,
61580	66300	their spouses and children, check in at desks just as they do flying United, Delta, or American,
66300	70740	but with an extra-early cutoff of two hours and twenty minutes before departure.
70740	74460	They then head through regular security and go to a regular gate in Terminal E.
74460	79500	Next, they board through a regular jet bridge onto an aircraft operated by a member of a
79500	82020	unique collection of airlines.
82020	87380	The scale of air passenger demand by the DoD is significant enough that whole charter airlines
87380	92020	have arisen that are significantly, if not entirely financially reliant on operating
92020	98020	Patriot Express flights on behalf of the government—Alice Air, National Airlines, and Omni Air International
98020	99140	among them.
99140	102940	With a goal of minimizing travel costs for the DoD, but also enabling staff outside of
102940	107380	combat zones to travel home more frequently on a discretionary basis, the Patriot Express
107380	111940	program lowers the relative distance between American military bases and the mainland United
111940	116360	States and vice versa, even to the extent of allowing a wider range of pets on board
116360	118000	than commercial airlines.
118000	123720	The military enables this relative connectivity by operating a space-available system.
123720	127820	People who need to travel to get to or from their deployments get guaranteed seats booked
127820	128820	in advance.
128820	133220	But for staff who just want to travel for non-job reasons, they can have any seat left
133220	137900	on a flight for free just by adding their name to a list via website or app, then showing
137900	141180	up to the airport on the day of its departure hoping for the best.
141180	145140	A priority system is used to rank house hunting trips, for example, as more important than
145140	150160	the travel of retired but still Space A eligible veterans, and any available seats are allocated
150160	151700	based on this order.
151700	155980	The system is regularly used for discretionary travel originating both from staff stationed
155980	158340	abroad and vice versa.
158340	163140	There are entire blogs and YouTube channels dedicated to advising eligible Space A travelers
163140	167780	as to the best techniques and strategies for using the system for vacations.
167780	171300	Military families regularly start their summer Europe trips by taking a Southwest flight
171300	175640	to BWI, then hoping for the best while waiting to see if they cleared the list for the evening's
175640	177500	flight to Ramstein Air Base.
177500	181820	And once they successfully make it to the other side of the Atlantic, another surprisingly
181820	186620	accommodating venture of the DoD awaits them—the Ramstein Inn.
186620	190540	Sitting directly opposite the Air Base's polished glass passenger terminal, the towering
190540	195260	hotel, operated by the DoD's Air Force Services Agency, offers hundreds of rooms
195260	200900	at reasonable rates only to eligible current or former DoD personnel and invited guests.
200900	205700	It's part of a large, global collection of hospitality sites offered by the United
205700	207880	States Department of Defense.
207880	211980	Each branch of the military operates a network of similar hotels on their bases, and some
211980	217000	purely recreational sites even exist to offer personnel at home, but especially abroad,
217000	221280	low-cost and American-styled rest and relaxation opportunities.
221280	224840	Nestled in the outskirts of Naples, Italy, for example, a mere 30-minute drive from the
224840	230600	8,000 personnel-strong Naval Support Activity Complex sits a recreation wonderland nestled
230600	233680	in the hollow of a dormant volcano.
233680	237700	Upon driving through the narrow gates, the view opens up to an approximate recreation
237700	242480	of a well-appointed American park, featuring an Olympic-sized swimming pool, a spattering
242480	247200	of picnic pavilions, camping sites, and rental cabins, a collection of softball, baseball,
247200	251400	football, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and paintball fields and courts, and
251400	255880	a wooden nine-hole golf course with a pro shop and clubhouse—a picturesque slice of
255880	259680	Italy available exclusively to military-aligned Americans.
259680	266360	But the Patriot Express is just one aspect of the massive, global, U.S. defense transportation
266360	267600	system.
267600	272240	The DoD ties its assets and systems together with the United States Transport Command,
272240	275440	headquartered at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.
275440	280680	Under its banner, and co-located on the same base, is Air Mobility Command, a major command
280680	282200	of the U.S. Air Force.
282200	288880	Now, Air Mobility Command does hold a massive fleet of hundreds of C-5, C-17, and C-130s,
288880	292760	and while these aircraft and their crew regularly train, provide humanitarian assistance, and
292760	297360	move some cargo through the U.S.'s global network of bases during peacetime, they primarily
297360	300320	exist for the eventuality of battlefield use.
300320	304480	They're not there to move regular pallets from Dover to Ramstein—they're there to
304480	308720	move critical, life-or-death supplies into a war zone.
308720	312840	For the more day-to-day job of supplying the DoD's global footprint, the military mostly
312840	317400	relies on commercial cargo airlines, some of which, such as Atlas Air, are the exact
317400	320240	same as those operating Patriot Express flights.
320240	324520	But to earn the right to this business, U.S.-flagged airlines sign up to participate in the Civil
324520	326080	Reserve Air Fleet.
326120	329680	Dozens of the country's largest airlines have committed 40% of their fleets to the
329680	334380	program, meaning should the need arise, these aircraft and four crews each would be fully
334380	337200	dedicated to military service.
337200	341980	While the bulk of the 450 aircraft would only ever be called up in a rare, full-scale mobilization
341980	346480	of the U.S. military, smaller capacity crunches have arisen throughout the years that have
346480	348760	necessitated the use of the air fleet.
348760	352360	The fleet was first activated to transport massive numbers of troops to and from theater
352360	356820	during the opening of the Gulf and Iraq Wars, and then was used for a third time to accommodate
356820	361000	the massive numbers of refugees airlifted out of Kabul during the final days of America's
361000	362760	withdrawal from Afghanistan.
362760	366720	The very aircraft that carried the general public each and every day to, from, and within
366720	371720	the U.S. were sent as far as Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar to transport evacuees to intermediary
371720	376620	stops at American bases in Europe, and eventually the U.S. where other, short-haul Civil Reserve
376620	380940	Air Fleet aircraft shuttle them to their final destinations within the country.
380940	384900	In exchange for prioritizing their fleet for whatever the DoD deems necessary, these
384900	389580	same airlines get priority in receiving a portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars
389580	394100	in annual DoD passenger and cargo transportation contracts.
394100	399100	But air cargo needs in peacetime are relatively minimal, because little is regularly time-sensitive
399100	404420	enough to justify its additional cost over more traditional means of freight transport.
404420	409140	The key with this system, and nearly all aspects of the defense transportation system, is that
409140	413420	it's designed around the recognition that, at any moment, the world could change in a
413420	418820	way that necessitates, or at least leads to, a massive mobilization of the U.S. military,
418820	423320	and therefore a massive mobilization of its people and supplies.
423320	427740	When that does occur, the DoD largely leans on the full capacity of its Patriot Express
427740	432780	operators, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and its own aircraft to get fighters to the front
432780	433780	lines.
433780	437940	But getting soldiers to far-flung conflict areas is only half the battle—they need
437940	442040	supplies, and moving everything from trucks and ammunition to bedrolls and toilet paper
442040	446140	across the world by air is anything but efficient.
446140	450580	So rather than shipping an armored Humvee from South Bend, Indiana to Kabul, Afghanistan,
450580	455580	or a tank part from Lima, Ohio to Camp Carroll, South Korea, members of the armed forces simply
455580	460660	pull them from a regional stockpile that has been carefully built up and positioned years
460660	462100	in advance.
462100	466620	One of the earliest advantages a country can gain in a conflict is control of the skies,
466620	470180	as this can help protect and optimize operations on the ground.
470180	475260	Therefore, setting up a functional in-theater airbase is high in the order of operations,
475260	480460	which is why the Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources Program exists.
480460	485220	An airbase involves a lot more than a runway, but thanks to the BEAR program, the U.S. Air
485220	488460	Force can quickly build one out of just a runway.
488460	492260	Once that's acquired, either peacefully or through force, the military can start flying
492260	498000	in BEAR resources from their storage locations around the world on standard C-17 cargo planes.
498000	502060	These resources are all pre-packaged and ready for transport so they can go out at a moment's
502060	506560	notice, and are specifically designed for rapid aircraft transport.
506560	510980	Each package of resources is roughly designed to accommodate 250 people so that if the base
510980	515220	is going to accommodate around 1,000 personnel, for example, they just have to multiply the
515220	518220	basic configuration by four.
518220	523260	These are organized into Unit Type Codes, or UTCs, that group individual supplies based
523260	525140	on their intended use.
525140	530160	For example, a BEAR deployment's foundational configuration includes the XFA-14 Combat Air
530160	535460	Force's initial UTC, which is composed of eight small shelters, eight medium shelters,
535460	540020	eight 25-kilowatt power distribution panels, 16 fire extinguishers, two sets of miscellaneous
540020	544340	spare parts, one generator, and one set of generator wheels.
544340	549240	Other foundational UTCs would also get sent out first, like XFA-17 Water Distribution
549240	555480	Initial, XFA-3C Mobility Air Forces Initial, and XFA-LS Self-Help Laundry, which includes
555480	560380	two small shelters, ten washers, ten dryers, four water heaters, four fire extinguishers,
560380	563440	and all the necessary plumbing and electrical supplies.
563440	567880	But others are designed to augment the base kit and only go out when needed, like XFA-CW,
567880	572640	which acts as a cold weather kit, including twelve 103k heaters, twelve exhaust pipes,
572640	574560	and twenty-four air ducts.
574560	578680	Each individual BEAR resource is designed to be assembled quickly—then offer building
578680	584120	a permanent airbase, therefore quickly cobbling one together when the need is most pressing.
584120	588480	For example, the small shelter system is rated for 90-minute assembly by a team of six, the
588480	593040	massive cavernous large area maintenance shelter can go up with ten people in 30 hours, while
593040	597060	the single-pallet expeditionary kitchen can start cooking for hundreds after just 90 minutes
597060	598900	of assembly by four people.
598900	603220	By adding on more and more UTCs, the military can build out an airbase with functions like
603220	607740	postal service, firefighting, chaplain services, water treatment, mortuary services, maintenance
607740	611020	operations, and more within a matter of days.
611020	616360	But the Air Force's advanced bases-in-a-box are only one example of how the military prepares
616360	620080	for transport constraints on the day a war breaks out.
620080	624500	In order to project power, supply fighting forces in days rather than weeks, and rapidly
624500	629680	set a theater, the US Army has stashed thousands of vehicles, weapons, and general supplies
629680	637140	in seven separate Army Prepositioned Stocks, or APSs, and these stocks are massive.
637140	641860	Take for example, APS-5, located at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait.
641860	646400	Overseen by the 401st Army Field Support Brigade and a cog in American conflicts in the Middle
646400	651420	East since the 1990s, the stockpile effectively allows the US to enter a regional battlefield
651420	655940	in a matter of days, and sustain the battle for a matter of months.
655940	661260	One of the Army's largest physical operations, APS-5 stocks equipment for strategic abilities,
661260	664900	reserve vehicles and munitions to replace those broken and consumed on the battlefront,
664900	669820	and the supplies required to outfit an armored brigade combat team, an infantry brigade combat
669820	674180	team, a sustainment brigade, a fires brigade, a medical support element set, and an army
674180	681380	watercraft set—effectively, $5.5 billion worth of materials just in brigade sets.
681380	687200	With so much gear, the 401st Army Field Support Brigade's time is entirely occupied by the
687200	691340	regular maintenance on the thousands of Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and the
691340	695420	rest of the fleet stored in the 120-degree heat along with testing and repairing weapons
695420	699580	stashed in climate-controlled warehouses to ensure their effectiveness should the need
699580	700780	arise.
700780	704980	If something were to boil over in the Middle East, it's expected that APS-5 can mobilize
704980	710340	an entire armored brigade combat team, a fighting force made up of 5,000 people, and a staggering
710340	714100	302 vehicles in just 96 hours.
714100	719940	But the Army's APSs aren't only impressive in their sheer scale and organization—they're
719940	724580	also impressive in their flexibility and adaptability, as one of their most critical preposition
724580	729180	stock operations isn't even land-based—it floats.
729180	734260	Bolstering APS-5 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in the 2000s,
734260	740060	and increasingly visible in the Pacific today, is the Army's APS-3—an assortment of 10-16
740580	742940	cargo-carrying ships.
742940	748380	At the core of APS-3 are two container ships—the MV Staff Sergeant Edward A. Carter Jr., an
748380	754260	MV LTC John U.D. Page, and five large government-owned cargo ships with roll-on-roll-off capabilities
754260	759340	that simplify unloading large, oversized vehicles and downloading in ports with limited infrastructure.
759340	764180	With the size and organization of this fleet changes based on need and location, APS-3
764180	768700	carries much of what land-based prepositioning stocks would—20,000 tons of munitions are
768700	773420	stored on container ships and up to two brigades or over 1,000 tracked and wheeled vehicles
773420	776700	worth of combat equipment are spread across the rest of the fleet.
776700	781420	Yet, while the Army's floating preposition stock proved invaluable in past conflicts
781420	785900	and helps project power in the Pacific today, it's the outlier in terms of its mobility,
785900	790100	as the Army has prioritized size in its prepositioning strategy.
790100	794880	The Navy, on the other hand, whose role in conflict is more expeditionary than sustained,
794880	799780	has leaned heavily into the flexibility afforded by prepositioning through floating stockpiles.
799780	804000	The Navy's prepositioning program is all about readiness, and to be closest to potential
804000	808760	conflict zones, their 14 maritime prepositioning ships are spread across three squadrons in
808760	812360	the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and the Western Pacific.
812360	817560	Like the Army, the Navy relies on large, medium-speed roll-on-roll-off ships, and each of the three
817560	822800	squadrons is designed to supply and sustain a Marine Expeditionary Brigade for 30 days,
822800	828720	which is no small task considering its size as a 17,000 person unit with ground, sea,
828720	829720	and air capabilities.
829720	834500	In a service that's built around rapid response, this maritime prepositioning force is able
834500	838480	to mobilize at a moment's notice, and provide supplies and operational support to amphibious
838480	842540	units already on the ground, while also kitting out Marines and Sailors being flown in from
842540	844000	around the world.
844000	847880	These capabilities are of increasing value to the DoD, as modern warfare has pivoted
847880	852240	away from massive ground wars, and at the same time the Pacific, with its tiny islands
852240	858120	and massive expanses of open water, has become an area of increasing concern for the US.
858120	861960	Prepositioning is incredibly valuable to the Air Force, Army, and Navy for its ability
861960	866520	to position each and remote battlefields quicker than any other fighting force.
866520	871540	It's also incredibly valuable in what it doesn't do—necessitate the immediate mobilization
871540	875540	of America's shipping power the second a conflict arises.
875540	880280	This helps protect against, or at least soften a surge in seal of demand when the US goes
880280	881280	to war.
881320	884520	And that only lasts so long.
884520	889480	For longer, drawn-out conflicts, armed forces need sealift to keep the supplies coming for
889480	891800	months and years.
891800	896480	This responsibility falls directly on the shoulders of US Transcom's Military Sealift
896480	897520	Command.
897520	903580	Of the roughly 120 vessels either owned or contracted by Sealift Command, these 32 provide
903580	908960	direct fleet support for deployed Navy forces, whether it be tankers replenishing fuel reserves
908960	911160	or cargo ships providing foodstuffs.
911160	915560	Now, in the event that more vessels are needed in a shipping surge, Sealift Command will
915560	920420	activate the 40-Plus Ready Reserve Force—a collection of old, government-owned ships
920420	927060	sitting inactive across American ports—some of which are so old they're actually steam-powered.
927060	931600	In addition to the emergency capacity available through the RRF, the US military also has
931600	936260	the Merchant Marine—a fleet of American-flagged private merchant ships that serve as auxiliary
936260	940620	cargo and people-moving resources along commercial trade routes for the Navy during peacetime
940620	941620	and war.
941620	945940	And it's directly here where some of the most pressing limitations to the US military's
945940	951200	transportation systems lie—in the inability to handle the surge and move major troop numbers
951200	953460	and supplies far afield.
953460	959140	Today, the ocean-going, privately-owned merchant fleet in the US is only 181 ships—a far
959140	962820	cry from the 565 in 1982.
962820	966320	Though design advances have increased storage capacity, the available deadweight tonnage
966320	969840	is only a fraction of what it was in the 80s and 90s.
969840	974900	And making things worse, in a 2019 test of preparedness of the Ready Reserve Force, only
974900	980380	41% of the available seal of capacity was actually ocean-ready—the expectation prior
980380	984060	had been that some 85% of the vessels would be fit for sea.
984060	989420	But despite those challenges, the United States military is commonly and objectively recognized
989420	993380	as the world's greatest fighting force, and while that does relate to its massive
993380	998380	budget, global presence, and the actual skill of its fighting forces, nothing can happen
998380	1003180	without the system that moves its people and equipment to where they're used.
1003180	1007840	Logistics power is military power, and so it's no wonder why the US DoD has put so
1007840	1012940	much funding and focus into its transportation system—it's a practical necessity during
1012940	1019340	peacetime and the very foundation of American military power abroad.
1020260	1025060	Another logistics marvel is the system behind grocery stores, but it's rather antiquated.
1025060	1028860	Distributors ship goods to a grocery store, then you search through to hopefully find
1028860	1031340	roughly the right amount of what you need.
1031340	1035860	HelloFresh innovates upon that model, shipping what you need, in the exact quantity you need,
1035860	1037300	directly to you.
1037300	1041320	You use their app or website to select one of 30 different meal options each week, then
1041320	1045600	all their ingredients show up on your doorstep in an insulated ice-packed box—they even
1045600	1049220	change the amount of ice and type of insulation depending on the temperature of the shipping
1049220	1051340	route and destination.
1051340	1054580	Next you get cooking with the instructions on the provided recipe card, but the cooking
1054580	1058060	goes quicker than average since you don't have to deal with measuring and certain ingredients
1058060	1059300	are pre-prepared.
