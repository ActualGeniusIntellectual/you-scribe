00:00.000 --> 00:06.260
There are roughly 295,450 people with at least $30 million.

00:06.260 --> 00:12.080
Such individuals, referred to as ultra-high net worth, represent about 0.0037% of the

00:12.080 --> 00:17.880
human population, yet they hold about a third, $35 trillion, of the world's wealth.

00:17.880 --> 00:23.800
Therefore, it's no wonder why a massive, global industry exists fully centered on supporting

00:23.800 --> 00:28.640
the pneumatic lifestyles of the world's wealthiest 295,000.

00:28.640 --> 00:33.160
As with any socioeconomic class, ultra-high net worth individuals are more likely to socialize

00:33.160 --> 00:38.120
with other ultra-high net worth individuals, yet intriguingly, the number of people earning

00:38.120 --> 00:42.600
and spending similarly to you goes down as your income goes up.

00:42.600 --> 00:46.960
Therefore, once you get to the top of the income scale, the scarcity of people like

00:46.960 --> 00:51.200
you stretches your social networks out to a global scale.

00:51.200 --> 00:55.320
Through the years, this led to the creation of the informal, but remarkably systematized

00:55.320 --> 00:58.200
so-called billionaire's social calendar.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.600
The year often starts on St. Bart's—the traditional New Year's Eve spot for the

01:01.600 --> 01:05.680
wealthiest few—then February might include the Super Bowl, and March skiing in Aspen

01:05.680 --> 01:06.960
or St. Moritz.

01:06.960 --> 01:10.600
Spring starts with the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia, while May includes the

01:10.600 --> 01:14.240
Cannes Film Festival and the conveniently close Monaco Grand Prix.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.060
June's highlight is the Henley Royal Rowing Regatta in England, July's as Wimbledon,

01:19.060 --> 01:22.980
August's as the Venice Film Festival, while September often includes a return to Monaco

01:22.980 --> 01:24.200
for its yacht show.

01:24.200 --> 01:28.160
October's the Friaz London Art Fair, November might include a trip down under for the Melbourne

01:28.160 --> 01:33.260
Cup, and finally, the last major event of the year, before St. Bart's of course, is

01:33.260 --> 01:35.440
Art Basel Miami Beach.

01:35.440 --> 01:38.360
These events are hardly about the events themselves.

01:38.360 --> 01:41.920
Most wealthy attendees to Monaco's Grand Prix hardly care about the racing, and its

01:41.920 --> 01:45.920
yacht show is far more than a sales event for the vessels, but rather they serve as

01:45.920 --> 01:50.120
an exclusive space made available only to wealthy people who want to socialize with

01:50.120 --> 01:51.600
other wealthy people.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.840
While few go to all, and each adapts the calendar to their preferences, ultra-wealthy individuals

01:55.840 --> 02:00.160
have often expressed a feeling of obligation to join the circuit in order to maintain their

02:00.160 --> 02:02.640
social standing.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.860
Such pressure may have motivated Jeff Bezos, for example, to start his 2022 as he did,

02:07.860 --> 02:11.640
on a yacht off St. Bart's with his partner, Lauren Sanchez.

02:11.640 --> 02:15.400
Thanks to publicly available aircraft transponder data, however, we're able to see what he

02:15.400 --> 02:17.480
did with the rest of his January.

02:17.480 --> 02:22.460
Bezos' pair of G650 jets are too large for St. Bart's' short runway, so they waited

02:22.460 --> 02:25.600
on neighboring St. Martin while the billionaire rang in the new year.

02:25.600 --> 02:31.340
Then, on the first, N271DV took off for the seven-hour flight to Los Angeles to drop Sanchez

02:31.340 --> 02:37.480
off, while the other, N758PB, flew the next day to take Bezos directly home to Seattle.

02:37.480 --> 02:41.120
Over the next two weeks, both jets regularly shuttled up and down the west coast between

02:41.120 --> 02:45.520
Seattle and Burbank, presumably to take Bezos and Sanchez to visit each other.

02:45.520 --> 02:49.700
On January 13th, however, one of the jets flew from Burbank to Maui, while the other

02:49.700 --> 02:54.400
flew from Seattle and stopped briefly at LAX before continuing on to Maui, presumably carrying

02:54.400 --> 02:59.360
Sanchez and Bezos respectively to the billionaire's new $78 million vacation home on the island,

02:59.360 --> 03:02.800
then each jet returned to the mainland four days later.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.920
Bezos appeared to visit Sanchez again on the 23rd, then four days later flew directly to

03:06.920 --> 03:08.680
Washington DC.

03:08.680 --> 03:12.500
Bezos owns the biggest home in the district, the largest newspaper in the city, and his

03:12.500 --> 03:16.560
company Amazon is constructing its second headquarters across the river in Crystal City,

03:16.560 --> 03:19.200
Virginia, so he was likely there for business.

03:19.200 --> 03:23.200
But finally, Bezos finished out the month by flying back to Burbank once again, and

03:23.200 --> 03:26.220
he did all of this while threading the needle between highlights on the billionaire's

03:26.220 --> 03:30.800
social calendar, as just 11 days later he flew down to LA for the Super Bowl.

03:30.800 --> 03:36.600
Across January, Bezos' lifestyle called for his G650s to fly 29,000 miles or 46,000

03:36.600 --> 03:40.760
kilometers in total, which is roughly equivalent to flying between Seattle and Sydney four

03:40.760 --> 03:41.880
times.

03:41.880 --> 03:49.160
To fuel this extent of travel, his jets used about 24,838 gallons or 94,022 liters of fuel,

03:49.160 --> 03:53.280
which could otherwise be used to propel the largest passenger aircraft in the world, an

03:53.280 --> 03:58.480
E380, across the Atlantic from DC to London with 500 passengers aboard.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.100
But Bezos' travel is indicative of the way that market analysts think ultra-luxury travel

04:03.100 --> 04:04.100
is heading.

04:04.100 --> 04:09.640
You see, two phenomena are crashing head-on to each other to throw the industry into turmoil.

04:09.640 --> 04:14.500
First, more people are getting wealthy than ever, as money is becoming increasingly consolidated

04:14.500 --> 04:18.960
at the top, and second, merely wealthy people are traveling less frequently than in years

04:18.960 --> 04:21.640
past but spending more than ever.

04:21.640 --> 04:27.720
Data indicate that prior to COVID, Americans spent an average of $4,871 on a trip to Greece,

04:27.720 --> 04:32.040
but now it's all the way up to $6,561.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.780
Airline executives have also jubilantly noted that first- and business-class revenue is

04:35.780 --> 04:40.760
remarkably strong despite the continued weakness in the traditionally lucrative business travel

04:40.760 --> 04:44.620
segment, mostly thanks to leisure travelers opting to pay the premium for more luxurious

04:44.620 --> 04:47.000
travel at a greater rate than ever.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.360
In New York City, the ultra-luxury hotel market is said to be booming, with all-time high

04:51.360 --> 04:56.920
prices and occupancy rates, and new super-premium properties opening faster than ever.

04:56.920 --> 05:01.380
Summer 2022 saw the opening of the highly anticipated Amman, New York, with the cheapest

05:01.380 --> 05:07.200
room starting at $2,600 a night, but more regularly pricing in the $3,000 or $4,000.

05:07.200 --> 05:11.960
Five years ago, the Amman's sister property, the Utah desert resort known as Amangiri,

05:11.960 --> 05:17.380
started at $1,400 a night, but these days that's doubled to $2,800 a night, and even

05:17.380 --> 05:21.840
with dynamic pricing charging a hefty premium for the most attractive dates, plenty of nights

05:21.840 --> 05:25.200
are regularly sold out even many months in advance.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.480
And of course, for those lucky enough to get a booking at resorts like the Amangiri, they

05:29.480 --> 05:34.480
need a way to get there, so it's no wonder why 2021 saw an all-time record-high number

05:34.480 --> 05:38.380
of private jet flights—3.3 million globally.

05:38.380 --> 05:42.940
This tremendous growth was in large part enabled by the propagation of the on-demand charter

05:42.940 --> 05:44.360
business model.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.540
Companies like Wheels Up, NetJets, and XO have revolutionized the industry by simplifying

05:48.540 --> 05:52.980
one-off charters of private jets, which makes the means of travel far more achievable for

05:52.980 --> 05:55.520
the twice-a-year wealthy leisure traveler.

05:55.520 --> 05:59.260
These private jets are serviced by fixed-based operators, which essentially act as private

05:59.260 --> 06:03.580
terminals for hire, and these are also observing record traffic, leading to more FBOs being

06:03.580 --> 06:07.420
developed, which is pushing up prices for airport real estate and hangars to an all-time

06:07.460 --> 06:08.740
high as well.

06:08.740 --> 06:13.320
So, as the industry has grown as large as ever, it's simultaneously more expensive

06:13.320 --> 06:17.660
than ever and more frustrating than ever to get access to a private jet.

06:17.660 --> 06:23.140
Essentially, across the ultra-luxury travel segment, there's a capacity crunch.

06:23.140 --> 06:26.980
More people than ever are willing to pay more for a night in a top hotel than most do for

06:26.980 --> 06:32.220
a month of rent, or more for a two-hour private flight than most pay for their cars.

06:32.220 --> 06:37.060
The pace of industry growth is outmatched by the growth in demand for the segment—the

06:37.700 --> 06:41.560
incredible consequence is that the super-wealthy have pushed the ultra-wealthy out from their

06:41.560 --> 06:43.400
traditional stomping grounds.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.760
There simply are not publicly available travel experiences expensive and exclusive enough

06:47.760 --> 06:51.860
for the wealthiest of the wealthiest anymore, so they're essentially turning to private

06:51.860 --> 06:54.820
everything.

06:54.820 --> 06:56.940
Yachts fulfill this need well.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.960
They allow the ultra-rich to travel on their own terms, bringing the quality of accommodations

07:00.960 --> 07:06.140
they expect to wherever they want to go, largely regardless of outside demand.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.040
But where they want to go is still largely dictated by that billionaire's calendar,

07:10.040 --> 07:14.220
so each fall, as the temperatures in the med drop and the final summer events finish up,

07:14.220 --> 07:17.140
a maritime migration begins.

07:17.140 --> 07:20.700
Some of the superyachts push off the dock with pared-down crews to begin the lengthy

07:20.700 --> 07:24.780
transatlantic passage under their own power, and while most yachts are capable of taking

07:24.780 --> 07:30.500
on most ocean crossings, it's an expensive, impractical, and dangerous endeavor.

07:30.500 --> 07:34.760
That's why these exist—yacht-carrying ships.

07:34.760 --> 07:38.480
These ships work year-round connecting the world's yachting hotspots, but in the fall

07:38.480 --> 07:42.000
and spring, it's all about the transatlantic migration.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.200
So, at the end of the med season, a deluge of vessels descend on yachting homes like

07:46.200 --> 07:50.360
Genoa, Italy and Palma de Mayorkas, Spain to load up on one of these vessels, their

07:50.360 --> 07:54.420
owners paying up to $100,000 for the convenience.

07:54.420 --> 07:58.240
Upon arrival in the Caribbean, their owners can once again access their yachts, providing

07:58.240 --> 08:03.420
convenient access to winter events like Art Basel Miami and New Year's on St. Bart's.

08:03.420 --> 08:07.180
As with every other segment of the industry, however, the superyacht industry is growing

08:07.180 --> 08:11.980
faster than ever, meaning what was previously a refuge from the constraints of land is finding

08:11.980 --> 08:14.540
itself increasingly stuck out at sea.

08:14.540 --> 08:18.260
Take, for instance, a berth at the yacht club De Monaco.

08:18.260 --> 08:20.620
First and foremost, it'll cost you.

08:20.620 --> 08:25.220
During the summer season, a night will cost the shortest vessels $275, but if you'd

08:25.220 --> 08:31.520
like to dock the same boat during the Monaco Grand Prix, the price skyrockets to over $16,500

08:31.520 --> 08:32.780
a night.

08:32.780 --> 08:37.180
To get one of the few spots that can fit the largest 60 or 70 meter vessels, it'll cost

08:37.180 --> 08:42.420
$73,000 a night, but even then, the clubhouse building blocks the view of the track, so

08:42.420 --> 08:47.500
to actually see the race, this fee includes access for two to the building itself.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.660
But cost is hardly the issue here.

08:49.660 --> 08:53.740
Rather, it's club membership, which requires that you were first sponsored by a member,

08:53.740 --> 08:55.820
then approved by the admissions committee.

08:55.820 --> 09:00.160
Once in, to secure a spot during the med season, berth reservations have to be booked months

09:00.160 --> 09:01.160
in advance.

09:01.160 --> 09:05.160
But for the only event that parallels the Grand Prix in exclusivity, the yacht show,

09:05.160 --> 09:07.920
just getting a berth is only half the battle.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.960
When showing your superyacht off to other attendees, the best spot to dock is here,

09:11.960 --> 09:16.500
across the way, so onlookers can take in the full profile of the vessel rather than just

09:16.500 --> 09:17.500
its rear.

09:17.500 --> 09:20.940
But getting these spots requires first that the yacht is too long to fit a traditional

09:20.940 --> 09:26.560
spot, and that you or your captain has a strong relationship with the event directors—relationships

09:26.560 --> 09:29.960
that take years to form.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.660
Getting these busy waters is an expensive pain.

09:33.660 --> 09:37.100
Superyacht ownership, in general, is an expensive pain.

09:37.100 --> 09:41.100
Yachts don't generally get someone from one place to the next efficiently at all—on

09:41.100 --> 09:45.460
the open ocean they're generally unpleasantly bumpy rides, and yearly costs generally average

09:45.460 --> 09:51.780
around 10% of the boat's value—yet across the board, no matter the length, sales only

09:51.780 --> 09:53.340
continue to rise.

09:53.340 --> 09:57.760
Anecdotally, the deals cut on the decks of these behemoth boats, and the valuable relationships

09:57.760 --> 10:01.840
curated at yacht club bars are said to make the investment worth it.

10:01.840 --> 10:05.980
As one new yacht owner told the New Yorker, quote, one deal secured on board will pay

10:05.980 --> 10:08.540
it all back many times over.

10:08.540 --> 10:13.000
So, increasingly, the yacht is now perceived as a necessary component of the billionaire

10:13.000 --> 10:17.400
social calendar, meaning the same way the wealthiest few are feeling about private aviation

10:17.400 --> 10:21.780
and ultra-luxury hotels now extends to the yachting world as well.

10:21.780 --> 10:25.060
In response, the ultra-wealthy are getting more creative.

10:25.720 --> 10:29.760
Over the past five years, just as overall sales and superyacht builds have risen, the

10:29.760 --> 10:34.680
number of superyachts over 40 meters being refitted has nearly doubled.

10:34.680 --> 10:38.880
More often than not, refitting means a visit to a boatyard for minor alterations.

10:38.880 --> 10:43.220
Sometimes, though, these refits are major, which reflects a growing trend—the rise

10:43.220 --> 10:45.120
of the expedition yacht.

10:45.120 --> 10:49.560
With traditional waters busier than ever and the experiential economy as big as ever, billionaires

10:49.560 --> 10:54.400
are rebuilding and buying superyachts capable of taking on more adventurous trips via sojourns

10:54.400 --> 10:57.780
into the Arctic or lengthy remote prowls across the Pacific.

10:57.780 --> 11:02.260
At the extreme end of this trend is a former Soviet icebreaker now rebuilt as an equally

11:02.260 --> 11:05.580
tough and luxurious expedition yacht called Legend.

11:05.580 --> 11:09.440
On the other, experiential yachting firms have popped up that create World War II battle

11:09.440 --> 11:13.660
simulations in the Pacific for bored kids or set up temporary restaurants on sandbars

11:13.660 --> 11:15.560
in the middle of the Maldives.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.100
The trend towards exploration and expedition isn't just a superyacht thing either—at

11:20.100 --> 11:24.240
the same time that increasingly numerous millionaires are pushing the ultra-wealthy away from their

11:24.240 --> 11:29.300
old stops, the interest in and social value of unique experiences is pulling billionaires

11:29.300 --> 11:34.680
to services offering one-of-a-kind adventures—from up-close gorilla safaris in Rwanda to luxurious

11:34.680 --> 11:36.940
overland treks to the South Pole.

11:36.940 --> 11:40.680
These luxpeditions, as they're called, are individually curated by companies like Brown

11:40.680 --> 11:45.220
and Hudson to push their guests through bare-grills-like experiences in frigid winter conditions before

11:45.220 --> 11:49.580
they escape to tents with heated floors and Michelin-star-worthy food waiting on them.

11:49.580 --> 11:54.560
Their goal is that the trip, in their words, is seared into the participant's memory.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.120
And if the extreme outdoors isn't of interest, Brown and Hudson offer the opportunity to

11:58.120 --> 12:02.480
travel like James Bond, to live a few days like someone else entirely, or go off on a

12:02.480 --> 12:04.160
globe-trotting grand tour.

12:04.160 --> 12:09.400
For the ultra-wealthy, the options are really endless—as long as it's legal, said one

12:09.400 --> 12:14.720
representative of a referral-only travel service, they'll do anything for a client.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.460
Bespoke traveling for the billionaire class is booming, and as long as the traveler gets

12:18.460 --> 12:22.480
a good story out of the experience or the ability to brag about visiting the Salar-Yondi

12:22.480 --> 12:27.080
desert in Bolivia, or the most rural reaches of Sudan before any of their friends, they'll

12:27.080 --> 12:30.320
keep paying well into the hundreds of thousands for it.

12:30.320 --> 12:35.440
But of course, the true top of the market is what we don't know about yet.

12:35.440 --> 12:40.360
Increasingly, wealthy people are traveling to be seen—either in person or on social

12:40.360 --> 12:41.360
media.

12:41.360 --> 12:45.800
In response, ultra-wealthy people are increasingly traveling to disappear, as reflected in the

12:45.800 --> 12:51.140
record sales of secluded $30, $40, and $50 million vacation homes in places like Hawaii,

12:51.140 --> 12:52.780
Colorado, and the Caribbean.

12:52.780 --> 12:57.180
We don't have a great sense of the ins and outs of the most expensive travel experiences,

12:57.180 --> 13:00.780
because the secrecy is part of the premium itself.

13:00.780 --> 13:05.340
By the time we do, the top of the wealth pyramid will have moved onto something else, always

13:05.340 --> 13:10.380
staying one step ahead of the merely wealthy.

13:10.380 --> 13:13.700
If you want to learn more about the yachting world, and specifically how builders are managing

13:13.700 --> 13:17.600
to design ever larger and more luxurious yachts, I'd recommend checking out this

13:17.600 --> 13:21.360
episode of the show Ultimate Processes on CuriosityStream.

13:21.360 --> 13:25.240
Tens of thousands of Wendover viewers are already subscribed to CuriosityStream, but

13:25.240 --> 13:29.000
for those of you who aren't yet, the good news is that it's actually a really good

13:29.000 --> 13:34.720
deal when signing up through our link because that also gets you access to Nebula for free.

13:34.720 --> 13:38.160
Nebula is a streaming site founded by myself and a bunch of other creators that Wendover

13:38.160 --> 13:42.740
viewers likely already watch, and as a creator-owned and operated platform, it was designed from

13:42.780 --> 13:46.000
the ground up to be the best home to the stuff we make.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.520
For example, by losing the ad-supported model, we're able to make videos on more niche

13:49.520 --> 13:52.960
subjects that we know would appeal to our core audience, but potentially not to the

13:52.960 --> 13:55.520
size of audience that would make it profitable on YouTube.

13:55.520 --> 13:59.000
We're also able to make higher-budget stuff, called Nebula originals.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.680
We at Wendover have made all these, each of which is some of our best stuff.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.380
You'd probably be blown away by the price if it was just for that, but it's not because

14:06.380 --> 14:10.760
the cheapest way to get access to Nebula, as I mentioned, is through CuriosityStream.

14:10.780 --> 14:14.780
When you all go to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover and sign up for any of their subscriptions,

14:14.780 --> 14:18.260
they'll throw in a Nebula subscription completely for free.

14:18.260 --> 14:22.180
That means you get access to all of the exclusive stuff we've made at Wendover, Half as Interesting

14:22.180 --> 14:27.180
and Jetlag the Game, plus all the exclusive stuff the 150 other Nebula creators have made,

14:27.180 --> 14:32.700
plus the entire massive, top-quality CuriosityStream catalog of non-fiction shows and documentaries.

14:32.700 --> 14:37.340
To get all of this for a year, all you have to do basically is not eat one cheeseburger—or

14:37.340 --> 14:39.460
at least, one overpriced cheeseburger.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.560
That's because when you head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, the annual subscription to

14:43.560 --> 14:49.680
CuriosityStream is just $14.79 a year right now, and again, that includes a free subscription

14:49.680 --> 14:53.440
to Nebula, which helps support us and loads of other independent creators.

14:53.440 --> 14:57.520
So, click the button on screen or head over to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, and

14:57.520 --> 14:59.720
thanks in advance for your support.
