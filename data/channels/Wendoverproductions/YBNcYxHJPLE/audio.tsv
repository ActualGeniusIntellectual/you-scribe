0	6260	There are roughly 295,450 people with at least $30 million.
6260	12080	Such individuals, referred to as ultra-high net worth, represent about 0.0037% of the
12080	17880	human population, yet they hold about a third, $35 trillion, of the world's wealth.
17880	23800	Therefore, it's no wonder why a massive, global industry exists fully centered on supporting
23800	28640	the pneumatic lifestyles of the world's wealthiest 295,000.
28640	33160	As with any socioeconomic class, ultra-high net worth individuals are more likely to socialize
33160	38120	with other ultra-high net worth individuals, yet intriguingly, the number of people earning
38120	42600	and spending similarly to you goes down as your income goes up.
42600	46960	Therefore, once you get to the top of the income scale, the scarcity of people like
46960	51200	you stretches your social networks out to a global scale.
51200	55320	Through the years, this led to the creation of the informal, but remarkably systematized
55320	58200	so-called billionaire's social calendar.
58200	61600	The year often starts on St. Bart's—the traditional New Year's Eve spot for the
61600	65680	wealthiest few—then February might include the Super Bowl, and March skiing in Aspen
65680	66960	or St. Moritz.
66960	70600	Spring starts with the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia, while May includes the
70600	74240	Cannes Film Festival and the conveniently close Monaco Grand Prix.
74240	79060	June's highlight is the Henley Royal Rowing Regatta in England, July's as Wimbledon,
79060	82980	August's as the Venice Film Festival, while September often includes a return to Monaco
82980	84200	for its yacht show.
84200	88160	October's the Friaz London Art Fair, November might include a trip down under for the Melbourne
88160	93260	Cup, and finally, the last major event of the year, before St. Bart's of course, is
93260	95440	Art Basel Miami Beach.
95440	98360	These events are hardly about the events themselves.
98360	101920	Most wealthy attendees to Monaco's Grand Prix hardly care about the racing, and its
101920	105920	yacht show is far more than a sales event for the vessels, but rather they serve as
105920	110120	an exclusive space made available only to wealthy people who want to socialize with
110120	111600	other wealthy people.
111600	115840	While few go to all, and each adapts the calendar to their preferences, ultra-wealthy individuals
115840	120160	have often expressed a feeling of obligation to join the circuit in order to maintain their
120160	122640	social standing.
122640	127860	Such pressure may have motivated Jeff Bezos, for example, to start his 2022 as he did,
127860	131640	on a yacht off St. Bart's with his partner, Lauren Sanchez.
131640	135400	Thanks to publicly available aircraft transponder data, however, we're able to see what he
135400	137480	did with the rest of his January.
137480	142460	Bezos' pair of G650 jets are too large for St. Bart's' short runway, so they waited
142460	145600	on neighboring St. Martin while the billionaire rang in the new year.
145600	151340	Then, on the first, N271DV took off for the seven-hour flight to Los Angeles to drop Sanchez
151340	157480	off, while the other, N758PB, flew the next day to take Bezos directly home to Seattle.
157480	161120	Over the next two weeks, both jets regularly shuttled up and down the west coast between
161120	165520	Seattle and Burbank, presumably to take Bezos and Sanchez to visit each other.
165520	169700	On January 13th, however, one of the jets flew from Burbank to Maui, while the other
169700	174400	flew from Seattle and stopped briefly at LAX before continuing on to Maui, presumably carrying
174400	179360	Sanchez and Bezos respectively to the billionaire's new $78 million vacation home on the island,
179360	182800	then each jet returned to the mainland four days later.
182800	186920	Bezos appeared to visit Sanchez again on the 23rd, then four days later flew directly to
186920	188680	Washington DC.
188680	192500	Bezos owns the biggest home in the district, the largest newspaper in the city, and his
192500	196560	company Amazon is constructing its second headquarters across the river in Crystal City,
196560	199200	Virginia, so he was likely there for business.
199200	203200	But finally, Bezos finished out the month by flying back to Burbank once again, and
203200	206220	he did all of this while threading the needle between highlights on the billionaire's
206220	210800	social calendar, as just 11 days later he flew down to LA for the Super Bowl.
210800	216600	Across January, Bezos' lifestyle called for his G650s to fly 29,000 miles or 46,000
216600	220760	kilometers in total, which is roughly equivalent to flying between Seattle and Sydney four
220760	221880	times.
221880	229160	To fuel this extent of travel, his jets used about 24,838 gallons or 94,022 liters of fuel,
229160	233280	which could otherwise be used to propel the largest passenger aircraft in the world, an
233280	238480	E380, across the Atlantic from DC to London with 500 passengers aboard.
238480	243100	But Bezos' travel is indicative of the way that market analysts think ultra-luxury travel
243100	244100	is heading.
244100	249640	You see, two phenomena are crashing head-on to each other to throw the industry into turmoil.
249640	254500	First, more people are getting wealthy than ever, as money is becoming increasingly consolidated
254500	258960	at the top, and second, merely wealthy people are traveling less frequently than in years
258960	261640	past but spending more than ever.
261640	267720	Data indicate that prior to COVID, Americans spent an average of $4,871 on a trip to Greece,
267720	272040	but now it's all the way up to $6,561.
272040	275780	Airline executives have also jubilantly noted that first- and business-class revenue is
275780	280760	remarkably strong despite the continued weakness in the traditionally lucrative business travel
280760	284620	segment, mostly thanks to leisure travelers opting to pay the premium for more luxurious
284620	287000	travel at a greater rate than ever.
287040	291360	In New York City, the ultra-luxury hotel market is said to be booming, with all-time high
291360	296920	prices and occupancy rates, and new super-premium properties opening faster than ever.
296920	301380	Summer 2022 saw the opening of the highly anticipated Amman, New York, with the cheapest
301380	307200	room starting at $2,600 a night, but more regularly pricing in the $3,000 or $4,000.
307200	311960	Five years ago, the Amman's sister property, the Utah desert resort known as Amangiri,
311960	317380	started at $1,400 a night, but these days that's doubled to $2,800 a night, and even
317380	321840	with dynamic pricing charging a hefty premium for the most attractive dates, plenty of nights
321840	325200	are regularly sold out even many months in advance.
325200	329480	And of course, for those lucky enough to get a booking at resorts like the Amangiri, they
329480	334480	need a way to get there, so it's no wonder why 2021 saw an all-time record-high number
334480	338380	of private jet flights—3.3 million globally.
338380	342940	This tremendous growth was in large part enabled by the propagation of the on-demand charter
342940	344360	business model.
344360	348540	Companies like Wheels Up, NetJets, and XO have revolutionized the industry by simplifying
348540	352980	one-off charters of private jets, which makes the means of travel far more achievable for
352980	355520	the twice-a-year wealthy leisure traveler.
355520	359260	These private jets are serviced by fixed-based operators, which essentially act as private
359260	363580	terminals for hire, and these are also observing record traffic, leading to more FBOs being
363580	367420	developed, which is pushing up prices for airport real estate and hangars to an all-time
367460	368740	high as well.
368740	373320	So, as the industry has grown as large as ever, it's simultaneously more expensive
373320	377660	than ever and more frustrating than ever to get access to a private jet.
377660	383140	Essentially, across the ultra-luxury travel segment, there's a capacity crunch.
383140	386980	More people than ever are willing to pay more for a night in a top hotel than most do for
386980	392220	a month of rent, or more for a two-hour private flight than most pay for their cars.
392220	397060	The pace of industry growth is outmatched by the growth in demand for the segment—the
397700	401560	incredible consequence is that the super-wealthy have pushed the ultra-wealthy out from their
401560	403400	traditional stomping grounds.
403400	407760	There simply are not publicly available travel experiences expensive and exclusive enough
407760	411860	for the wealthiest of the wealthiest anymore, so they're essentially turning to private
411860	414820	everything.
414820	416940	Yachts fulfill this need well.
416940	420960	They allow the ultra-rich to travel on their own terms, bringing the quality of accommodations
420960	426140	they expect to wherever they want to go, largely regardless of outside demand.
426220	430040	But where they want to go is still largely dictated by that billionaire's calendar,
430040	434220	so each fall, as the temperatures in the med drop and the final summer events finish up,
434220	437140	a maritime migration begins.
437140	440700	Some of the superyachts push off the dock with pared-down crews to begin the lengthy
440700	444780	transatlantic passage under their own power, and while most yachts are capable of taking
444780	450500	on most ocean crossings, it's an expensive, impractical, and dangerous endeavor.
450500	454760	That's why these exist—yacht-carrying ships.
454760	458480	These ships work year-round connecting the world's yachting hotspots, but in the fall
458480	462000	and spring, it's all about the transatlantic migration.
462000	466200	So, at the end of the med season, a deluge of vessels descend on yachting homes like
466200	470360	Genoa, Italy and Palma de Mayorkas, Spain to load up on one of these vessels, their
470360	474420	owners paying up to $100,000 for the convenience.
474420	478240	Upon arrival in the Caribbean, their owners can once again access their yachts, providing
478240	483420	convenient access to winter events like Art Basel Miami and New Year's on St. Bart's.
483420	487180	As with every other segment of the industry, however, the superyacht industry is growing
487180	491980	faster than ever, meaning what was previously a refuge from the constraints of land is finding
491980	494540	itself increasingly stuck out at sea.
494540	498260	Take, for instance, a berth at the yacht club De Monaco.
498260	500620	First and foremost, it'll cost you.
500620	505220	During the summer season, a night will cost the shortest vessels $275, but if you'd
505220	511520	like to dock the same boat during the Monaco Grand Prix, the price skyrockets to over $16,500
511520	512780	a night.
512780	517180	To get one of the few spots that can fit the largest 60 or 70 meter vessels, it'll cost
517180	522420	$73,000 a night, but even then, the clubhouse building blocks the view of the track, so
522420	527500	to actually see the race, this fee includes access for two to the building itself.
527500	529660	But cost is hardly the issue here.
529660	533740	Rather, it's club membership, which requires that you were first sponsored by a member,
533740	535820	then approved by the admissions committee.
535820	540160	Once in, to secure a spot during the med season, berth reservations have to be booked months
540160	541160	in advance.
541160	545160	But for the only event that parallels the Grand Prix in exclusivity, the yacht show,
545160	547920	just getting a berth is only half the battle.
547920	551960	When showing your superyacht off to other attendees, the best spot to dock is here,
551960	556500	across the way, so onlookers can take in the full profile of the vessel rather than just
556500	557500	its rear.
557500	560940	But getting these spots requires first that the yacht is too long to fit a traditional
560940	566560	spot, and that you or your captain has a strong relationship with the event directors—relationships
566560	569960	that take years to form.
569960	573660	Getting these busy waters is an expensive pain.
573660	577100	Superyacht ownership, in general, is an expensive pain.
577100	581100	Yachts don't generally get someone from one place to the next efficiently at all—on
581100	585460	the open ocean they're generally unpleasantly bumpy rides, and yearly costs generally average
585460	591780	around 10% of the boat's value—yet across the board, no matter the length, sales only
591780	593340	continue to rise.
593340	597760	Anecdotally, the deals cut on the decks of these behemoth boats, and the valuable relationships
597760	601840	curated at yacht club bars are said to make the investment worth it.
601840	605980	As one new yacht owner told the New Yorker, quote, one deal secured on board will pay
605980	608540	it all back many times over.
608540	613000	So, increasingly, the yacht is now perceived as a necessary component of the billionaire
613000	617400	social calendar, meaning the same way the wealthiest few are feeling about private aviation
617400	621780	and ultra-luxury hotels now extends to the yachting world as well.
621780	625060	In response, the ultra-wealthy are getting more creative.
625720	629760	Over the past five years, just as overall sales and superyacht builds have risen, the
629760	634680	number of superyachts over 40 meters being refitted has nearly doubled.
634680	638880	More often than not, refitting means a visit to a boatyard for minor alterations.
638880	643220	Sometimes, though, these refits are major, which reflects a growing trend—the rise
643220	645120	of the expedition yacht.
645120	649560	With traditional waters busier than ever and the experiential economy as big as ever, billionaires
649560	654400	are rebuilding and buying superyachts capable of taking on more adventurous trips via sojourns
654400	657780	into the Arctic or lengthy remote prowls across the Pacific.
657780	662260	At the extreme end of this trend is a former Soviet icebreaker now rebuilt as an equally
662260	665580	tough and luxurious expedition yacht called Legend.
665580	669440	On the other, experiential yachting firms have popped up that create World War II battle
669440	673660	simulations in the Pacific for bored kids or set up temporary restaurants on sandbars
673660	675560	in the middle of the Maldives.
675560	680100	The trend towards exploration and expedition isn't just a superyacht thing either—at
680100	684240	the same time that increasingly numerous millionaires are pushing the ultra-wealthy away from their
684240	689300	old stops, the interest in and social value of unique experiences is pulling billionaires
689300	694680	to services offering one-of-a-kind adventures—from up-close gorilla safaris in Rwanda to luxurious
694680	696940	overland treks to the South Pole.
696940	700680	These luxpeditions, as they're called, are individually curated by companies like Brown
700680	705220	and Hudson to push their guests through bare-grills-like experiences in frigid winter conditions before
705220	709580	they escape to tents with heated floors and Michelin-star-worthy food waiting on them.
709580	714560	Their goal is that the trip, in their words, is seared into the participant's memory.
714560	718120	And if the extreme outdoors isn't of interest, Brown and Hudson offer the opportunity to
718120	722480	travel like James Bond, to live a few days like someone else entirely, or go off on a
722480	724160	globe-trotting grand tour.
724160	729400	For the ultra-wealthy, the options are really endless—as long as it's legal, said one
729400	734720	representative of a referral-only travel service, they'll do anything for a client.
734720	738460	Bespoke traveling for the billionaire class is booming, and as long as the traveler gets
738460	742480	a good story out of the experience or the ability to brag about visiting the Salar-Yondi
742480	747080	desert in Bolivia, or the most rural reaches of Sudan before any of their friends, they'll
747080	750320	keep paying well into the hundreds of thousands for it.
750320	755440	But of course, the true top of the market is what we don't know about yet.
755440	760360	Increasingly, wealthy people are traveling to be seen—either in person or on social
760360	761360	media.
761360	765800	In response, ultra-wealthy people are increasingly traveling to disappear, as reflected in the
765800	771140	record sales of secluded $30, $40, and $50 million vacation homes in places like Hawaii,
771140	772780	Colorado, and the Caribbean.
772780	777180	We don't have a great sense of the ins and outs of the most expensive travel experiences,
777180	780780	because the secrecy is part of the premium itself.
780780	785340	By the time we do, the top of the wealth pyramid will have moved onto something else, always
785340	790380	staying one step ahead of the merely wealthy.
790380	793700	If you want to learn more about the yachting world, and specifically how builders are managing
793700	797600	to design ever larger and more luxurious yachts, I'd recommend checking out this
797600	801360	episode of the show Ultimate Processes on CuriosityStream.
801360	805240	Tens of thousands of Wendover viewers are already subscribed to CuriosityStream, but
805240	809000	for those of you who aren't yet, the good news is that it's actually a really good
809000	814720	deal when signing up through our link because that also gets you access to Nebula for free.
814720	818160	Nebula is a streaming site founded by myself and a bunch of other creators that Wendover
818160	822740	viewers likely already watch, and as a creator-owned and operated platform, it was designed from
822780	826000	the ground up to be the best home to the stuff we make.
826000	829520	For example, by losing the ad-supported model, we're able to make videos on more niche
829520	832960	subjects that we know would appeal to our core audience, but potentially not to the
832960	835520	size of audience that would make it profitable on YouTube.
835520	839000	We're also able to make higher-budget stuff, called Nebula originals.
839000	842680	We at Wendover have made all these, each of which is some of our best stuff.
842680	846380	You'd probably be blown away by the price if it was just for that, but it's not because
846380	850760	the cheapest way to get access to Nebula, as I mentioned, is through CuriosityStream.
850780	854780	When you all go to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover and sign up for any of their subscriptions,
854780	858260	they'll throw in a Nebula subscription completely for free.
858260	862180	That means you get access to all of the exclusive stuff we've made at Wendover, Half as Interesting
862180	867180	and Jetlag the Game, plus all the exclusive stuff the 150 other Nebula creators have made,
867180	872700	plus the entire massive, top-quality CuriosityStream catalog of non-fiction shows and documentaries.
872700	877340	To get all of this for a year, all you have to do basically is not eat one cheeseburger—or
877340	879460	at least, one overpriced cheeseburger.
879480	883560	That's because when you head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, the annual subscription to
883560	889680	CuriosityStream is just $14.79 a year right now, and again, that includes a free subscription
889680	893440	to Nebula, which helps support us and loads of other independent creators.
893440	897520	So, click the button on screen or head over to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, and
897520	899720	thanks in advance for your support.
