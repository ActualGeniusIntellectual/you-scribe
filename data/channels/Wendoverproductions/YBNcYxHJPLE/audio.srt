1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,260
There are roughly 295,450 people with at least $30 million.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:12,080
Such individuals, referred to as ultra-high net worth, represent about 0.0037% of the

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,880
human population, yet they hold about a third, $35 trillion, of the world's wealth.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,800
Therefore, it's no wonder why a massive, global industry exists fully centered on supporting

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,640
the pneumatic lifestyles of the world's wealthiest 295,000.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,160
As with any socioeconomic class, ultra-high net worth individuals are more likely to socialize

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:38,120
with other ultra-high net worth individuals, yet intriguingly, the number of people earning

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,600
and spending similarly to you goes down as your income goes up.

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,960
Therefore, once you get to the top of the income scale, the scarcity of people like

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,200
you stretches your social networks out to a global scale.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,320
Through the years, this led to the creation of the informal, but remarkably systematized

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,200
so-called billionaire's social calendar.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
The year often starts on St. Bart's—the traditional New Year's Eve spot for the

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
wealthiest few—then February might include the Super Bowl, and March skiing in Aspen

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,960
or St. Moritz.

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,600
Spring starts with the Masters golf tournament in Augusta, Georgia, while May includes the

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,240
Cannes Film Festival and the conveniently close Monaco Grand Prix.

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,060
June's highlight is the Henley Royal Rowing Regatta in England, July's as Wimbledon,

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,980
August's as the Venice Film Festival, while September often includes a return to Monaco

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,200
for its yacht show.

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,160
October's the Friaz London Art Fair, November might include a trip down under for the Melbourne

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,260
Cup, and finally, the last major event of the year, before St. Bart's of course, is

23
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,440
Art Basel Miami Beach.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,360
These events are hardly about the events themselves.

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,920
Most wealthy attendees to Monaco's Grand Prix hardly care about the racing, and its

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,920
yacht show is far more than a sales event for the vessels, but rather they serve as

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,120
an exclusive space made available only to wealthy people who want to socialize with

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,600
other wealthy people.

29
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,840
While few go to all, and each adapts the calendar to their preferences, ultra-wealthy individuals

30
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,160
have often expressed a feeling of obligation to join the circuit in order to maintain their

31
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,640
social standing.

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,860
Such pressure may have motivated Jeff Bezos, for example, to start his 2022 as he did,

33
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,640
on a yacht off St. Bart's with his partner, Lauren Sanchez.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,400
Thanks to publicly available aircraft transponder data, however, we're able to see what he

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,480
did with the rest of his January.

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,460
Bezos' pair of G650 jets are too large for St. Bart's' short runway, so they waited

37
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,600
on neighboring St. Martin while the billionaire rang in the new year.

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,340
Then, on the first, N271DV took off for the seven-hour flight to Los Angeles to drop Sanchez

39
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,480
off, while the other, N758PB, flew the next day to take Bezos directly home to Seattle.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,120
Over the next two weeks, both jets regularly shuttled up and down the west coast between

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,520
Seattle and Burbank, presumably to take Bezos and Sanchez to visit each other.

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,700
On January 13th, however, one of the jets flew from Burbank to Maui, while the other

43
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:54,400
flew from Seattle and stopped briefly at LAX before continuing on to Maui, presumably carrying

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,360
Sanchez and Bezos respectively to the billionaire's new $78 million vacation home on the island,

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,800
then each jet returned to the mainland four days later.

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,920
Bezos appeared to visit Sanchez again on the 23rd, then four days later flew directly to

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,680
Washington DC.

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,500
Bezos owns the biggest home in the district, the largest newspaper in the city, and his

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,560
company Amazon is constructing its second headquarters across the river in Crystal City,

50
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,200
Virginia, so he was likely there for business.

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,200
But finally, Bezos finished out the month by flying back to Burbank once again, and

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,220
he did all of this while threading the needle between highlights on the billionaire's

53
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,800
social calendar, as just 11 days later he flew down to LA for the Super Bowl.

54
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,600
Across January, Bezos' lifestyle called for his G650s to fly 29,000 miles or 46,000

55
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,760
kilometers in total, which is roughly equivalent to flying between Seattle and Sydney four

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,880
times.

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,160
To fuel this extent of travel, his jets used about 24,838 gallons or 94,022 liters of fuel,

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,280
which could otherwise be used to propel the largest passenger aircraft in the world, an

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,480
E380, across the Atlantic from DC to London with 500 passengers aboard.

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,100
But Bezos' travel is indicative of the way that market analysts think ultra-luxury travel

61
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
is heading.

62
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,640
You see, two phenomena are crashing head-on to each other to throw the industry into turmoil.

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,500
First, more people are getting wealthy than ever, as money is becoming increasingly consolidated

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,960
at the top, and second, merely wealthy people are traveling less frequently than in years

65
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,640
past but spending more than ever.

66
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:27,720
Data indicate that prior to COVID, Americans spent an average of $4,871 on a trip to Greece,

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,040
but now it's all the way up to $6,561.

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,780
Airline executives have also jubilantly noted that first- and business-class revenue is

69
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,760
remarkably strong despite the continued weakness in the traditionally lucrative business travel

70
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,620
segment, mostly thanks to leisure travelers opting to pay the premium for more luxurious

71
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,000
travel at a greater rate than ever.

72
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,360
In New York City, the ultra-luxury hotel market is said to be booming, with all-time high

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,920
prices and occupancy rates, and new super-premium properties opening faster than ever.

74
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,380
Summer 2022 saw the opening of the highly anticipated Amman, New York, with the cheapest

75
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,200
room starting at $2,600 a night, but more regularly pricing in the $3,000 or $4,000.

76
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,960
Five years ago, the Amman's sister property, the Utah desert resort known as Amangiri,

77
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,380
started at $1,400 a night, but these days that's doubled to $2,800 a night, and even

78
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,840
with dynamic pricing charging a hefty premium for the most attractive dates, plenty of nights

79
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,200
are regularly sold out even many months in advance.

80
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,480
And of course, for those lucky enough to get a booking at resorts like the Amangiri, they

81
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,480
need a way to get there, so it's no wonder why 2021 saw an all-time record-high number

82
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,380
of private jet flights—3.3 million globally.

83
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,940
This tremendous growth was in large part enabled by the propagation of the on-demand charter

84
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,360
business model.

85
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,540
Companies like Wheels Up, NetJets, and XO have revolutionized the industry by simplifying

86
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,980
one-off charters of private jets, which makes the means of travel far more achievable for

87
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,520
the twice-a-year wealthy leisure traveler.

88
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,260
These private jets are serviced by fixed-based operators, which essentially act as private

89
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,580
terminals for hire, and these are also observing record traffic, leading to more FBOs being

90
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,420
developed, which is pushing up prices for airport real estate and hangars to an all-time

91
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,740
high as well.

92
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,320
So, as the industry has grown as large as ever, it's simultaneously more expensive

93
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,660
than ever and more frustrating than ever to get access to a private jet.

94
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:23,140
Essentially, across the ultra-luxury travel segment, there's a capacity crunch.

95
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,980
More people than ever are willing to pay more for a night in a top hotel than most do for

96
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,220
a month of rent, or more for a two-hour private flight than most pay for their cars.

97
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,060
The pace of industry growth is outmatched by the growth in demand for the segment—the

98
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,560
incredible consequence is that the super-wealthy have pushed the ultra-wealthy out from their

99
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,400
traditional stomping grounds.

100
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,760
There simply are not publicly available travel experiences expensive and exclusive enough

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,860
for the wealthiest of the wealthiest anymore, so they're essentially turning to private

102
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,820
everything.

103
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,940
Yachts fulfill this need well.

104
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,960
They allow the ultra-rich to travel on their own terms, bringing the quality of accommodations

105
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,140
they expect to wherever they want to go, largely regardless of outside demand.

106
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,040
But where they want to go is still largely dictated by that billionaire's calendar,

107
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,220
so each fall, as the temperatures in the med drop and the final summer events finish up,

108
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,140
a maritime migration begins.

109
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,700
Some of the superyachts push off the dock with pared-down crews to begin the lengthy

110
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,780
transatlantic passage under their own power, and while most yachts are capable of taking

111
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:30,500
on most ocean crossings, it's an expensive, impractical, and dangerous endeavor.

112
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,760
That's why these exist—yacht-carrying ships.

113
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,480
These ships work year-round connecting the world's yachting hotspots, but in the fall

114
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,000
and spring, it's all about the transatlantic migration.

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,200
So, at the end of the med season, a deluge of vessels descend on yachting homes like

116
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,360
Genoa, Italy and Palma de Mayorkas, Spain to load up on one of these vessels, their

117
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,420
owners paying up to $100,000 for the convenience.

118
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,240
Upon arrival in the Caribbean, their owners can once again access their yachts, providing

119
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,420
convenient access to winter events like Art Basel Miami and New Year's on St. Bart's.

120
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,180
As with every other segment of the industry, however, the superyacht industry is growing

121
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,980
faster than ever, meaning what was previously a refuge from the constraints of land is finding

122
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,540
itself increasingly stuck out at sea.

123
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,260
Take, for instance, a berth at the yacht club De Monaco.

124
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,620
First and foremost, it'll cost you.

125
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,220
During the summer season, a night will cost the shortest vessels $275, but if you'd

126
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:31,520
like to dock the same boat during the Monaco Grand Prix, the price skyrockets to over $16,500

127
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,780
a night.

128
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:37,180
To get one of the few spots that can fit the largest 60 or 70 meter vessels, it'll cost

129
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,420
$73,000 a night, but even then, the clubhouse building blocks the view of the track, so

130
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:47,500
to actually see the race, this fee includes access for two to the building itself.

131
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,660
But cost is hardly the issue here.

132
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,740
Rather, it's club membership, which requires that you were first sponsored by a member,

133
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,820
then approved by the admissions committee.

134
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,160
Once in, to secure a spot during the med season, berth reservations have to be booked months

135
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
in advance.

136
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
But for the only event that parallels the Grand Prix in exclusivity, the yacht show,

137
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,920
just getting a berth is only half the battle.

138
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,960
When showing your superyacht off to other attendees, the best spot to dock is here,

139
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,500
across the way, so onlookers can take in the full profile of the vessel rather than just

140
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
its rear.

141
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,940
But getting these spots requires first that the yacht is too long to fit a traditional

142
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,560
spot, and that you or your captain has a strong relationship with the event directors—relationships

143
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,960
that take years to form.

144
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,660
Getting these busy waters is an expensive pain.

145
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,100
Superyacht ownership, in general, is an expensive pain.

146
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Yachts don't generally get someone from one place to the next efficiently at all—on

147
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,460
the open ocean they're generally unpleasantly bumpy rides, and yearly costs generally average

148
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,780
around 10% of the boat's value—yet across the board, no matter the length, sales only

149
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,340
continue to rise.

150
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,760
Anecdotally, the deals cut on the decks of these behemoth boats, and the valuable relationships

151
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,840
curated at yacht club bars are said to make the investment worth it.

152
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,980
As one new yacht owner told the New Yorker, quote, one deal secured on board will pay

153
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,540
it all back many times over.

154
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,000
So, increasingly, the yacht is now perceived as a necessary component of the billionaire

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,400
social calendar, meaning the same way the wealthiest few are feeling about private aviation

156
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,780
and ultra-luxury hotels now extends to the yachting world as well.

157
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,060
In response, the ultra-wealthy are getting more creative.

158
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,760
Over the past five years, just as overall sales and superyacht builds have risen, the

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,680
number of superyachts over 40 meters being refitted has nearly doubled.

160
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,880
More often than not, refitting means a visit to a boatyard for minor alterations.

161
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,220
Sometimes, though, these refits are major, which reflects a growing trend—the rise

162
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,120
of the expedition yacht.

163
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,560
With traditional waters busier than ever and the experiential economy as big as ever, billionaires

164
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,400
are rebuilding and buying superyachts capable of taking on more adventurous trips via sojourns

165
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,780
into the Arctic or lengthy remote prowls across the Pacific.

166
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,260
At the extreme end of this trend is a former Soviet icebreaker now rebuilt as an equally

167
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,580
tough and luxurious expedition yacht called Legend.

168
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,440
On the other, experiential yachting firms have popped up that create World War II battle

169
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,660
simulations in the Pacific for bored kids or set up temporary restaurants on sandbars

170
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,560
in the middle of the Maldives.

171
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,100
The trend towards exploration and expedition isn't just a superyacht thing either—at

172
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,240
the same time that increasingly numerous millionaires are pushing the ultra-wealthy away from their

173
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,300
old stops, the interest in and social value of unique experiences is pulling billionaires

174
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,680
to services offering one-of-a-kind adventures—from up-close gorilla safaris in Rwanda to luxurious

175
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,940
overland treks to the South Pole.

176
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,680
These luxpeditions, as they're called, are individually curated by companies like Brown

177
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,220
and Hudson to push their guests through bare-grills-like experiences in frigid winter conditions before

178
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,580
they escape to tents with heated floors and Michelin-star-worthy food waiting on them.

179
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:54,560
Their goal is that the trip, in their words, is seared into the participant's memory.

180
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,120
And if the extreme outdoors isn't of interest, Brown and Hudson offer the opportunity to

181
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,480
travel like James Bond, to live a few days like someone else entirely, or go off on a

182
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,160
globe-trotting grand tour.

183
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,400
For the ultra-wealthy, the options are really endless—as long as it's legal, said one

184
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,720
representative of a referral-only travel service, they'll do anything for a client.

185
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,460
Bespoke traveling for the billionaire class is booming, and as long as the traveler gets

186
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,480
a good story out of the experience or the ability to brag about visiting the Salar-Yondi

187
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,080
desert in Bolivia, or the most rural reaches of Sudan before any of their friends, they'll

188
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,320
keep paying well into the hundreds of thousands for it.

189
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,440
But of course, the true top of the market is what we don't know about yet.

190
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,360
Increasingly, wealthy people are traveling to be seen—either in person or on social

191
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
media.

192
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,800
In response, ultra-wealthy people are increasingly traveling to disappear, as reflected in the

193
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:51,140
record sales of secluded $30, $40, and $50 million vacation homes in places like Hawaii,

194
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,780
Colorado, and the Caribbean.

195
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:57,180
We don't have a great sense of the ins and outs of the most expensive travel experiences,

196
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,780
because the secrecy is part of the premium itself.

197
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,340
By the time we do, the top of the wealth pyramid will have moved onto something else, always

198
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,380
staying one step ahead of the merely wealthy.

199
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,700
If you want to learn more about the yachting world, and specifically how builders are managing

200
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,600
to design ever larger and more luxurious yachts, I'd recommend checking out this

201
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,360
episode of the show Ultimate Processes on CuriosityStream.

202
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Tens of thousands of Wendover viewers are already subscribed to CuriosityStream, but

203
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,000
for those of you who aren't yet, the good news is that it's actually a really good

204
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,720
deal when signing up through our link because that also gets you access to Nebula for free.

205
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,160
Nebula is a streaming site founded by myself and a bunch of other creators that Wendover

206
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,740
viewers likely already watch, and as a creator-owned and operated platform, it was designed from

207
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,000
the ground up to be the best home to the stuff we make.

208
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,520
For example, by losing the ad-supported model, we're able to make videos on more niche

209
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,960
subjects that we know would appeal to our core audience, but potentially not to the

210
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,520
size of audience that would make it profitable on YouTube.

211
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,000
We're also able to make higher-budget stuff, called Nebula originals.

212
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,680
We at Wendover have made all these, each of which is some of our best stuff.

213
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,380
You'd probably be blown away by the price if it was just for that, but it's not because

214
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:10,760
the cheapest way to get access to Nebula, as I mentioned, is through CuriosityStream.

215
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,780
When you all go to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover and sign up for any of their subscriptions,

216
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,260
they'll throw in a Nebula subscription completely for free.

217
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,180
That means you get access to all of the exclusive stuff we've made at Wendover, Half as Interesting

218
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:27,180
and Jetlag the Game, plus all the exclusive stuff the 150 other Nebula creators have made,

219
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,700
plus the entire massive, top-quality CuriosityStream catalog of non-fiction shows and documentaries.

220
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,340
To get all of this for a year, all you have to do basically is not eat one cheeseburger—or

221
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,460
at least, one overpriced cheeseburger.

222
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,560
That's because when you head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, the annual subscription to

223
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,680
CuriosityStream is just $14.79 a year right now, and again, that includes a free subscription

224
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,440
to Nebula, which helps support us and loads of other independent creators.

225
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,520
So, click the button on screen or head over to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, and

226
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,720
thanks in advance for your support.
