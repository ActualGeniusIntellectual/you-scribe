6160	12400	address at hover.com slash wendover. COVID-19—that's the answer. That's
12400	18560	what caused all the shortages of 2020 and 2021. That's it. COVID-19 caused these shortages in
18560	23840	the same way that an iceberg caused the Titanic to sink, or the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused
23840	30320	the Great Recession, or the straw broke the camel's back. That's really to say, COVID did
30320	35200	cause these shortages. They would not have happened in the manner they did when they did,
35200	40480	if not for the pandemic. But just as the Titanic's design flaws would eventually lead to calamity,
40480	44480	the vulnerabilities in the global economy would eventually lead to a recession, and something
44480	50720	would eventually break the overloaded camel's back, COVID caused these shortages, but it's not
50720	57920	what made them possible. What made them possible is a fundamental, structural vulnerability in the
57920	66080	way today's supply chains work. On April 13th, 2021, Boba Bliss, a small bubble tea shop in
66080	71360	Dublin, California, posted on Facebook. They explained that they were having a hard time
71360	75040	getting their ingredients, and that this would mean their menu would have to change daily,
75040	79520	reflective of what they could actually get from their supplier. On April 15th,
79520	84320	Mighty Boba, in Canandaigua, New York, explained on Facebook that they would have to serve a
84320	89840	smaller quantity of tapioca pearls in each drink, and would no longer be offering extra as an option
89840	95360	due to a shortage of this ingredient. Bing's Boba Tea in Tucson, Arizona said much the same
95360	99760	one week later, and Tea Hut in San Francisco, California then announced that they would have
99760	106400	to raise their prices due to a 26% rise in their ingredient costs. All across the country,
106400	111680	shops selling this popular Taiwanese drink simply could not get ingredients in the quantities
111680	119040	demanded, despite no dramatic increase in demand. However, thousands of miles away, in Taiwan,
119040	124160	where much of the world's bubble tea ingredients are made, things were operating fairly normally.
124160	128640	With single-digit daily case numbers for much of COVID's reign, factories on the island were
128640	134720	able to work at full force in a way they couldn't elsewhere, but still, somehow, Boba Bliss,
134720	140800	Mighty Boba, Bing's Boba Tea, Tea Hut, and thousands of other shops across the US couldn't
140800	146080	get their product. The problem had less to do with anything happening in Taiwan, and more with
146080	152720	what was happening here—in the waters, off the coast of Los Angeles. Throughout the first half
152720	159840	of 2021, a rotating cast of dozens of cargo ships have dotted the Pacific's horizon. Each sat there,
159840	165040	at anchor, sometimes for weeks, until a spot opened for them at the port of Los Angeles or
165040	171360	Long Beach. This is abnormal. While the year prior it was possible for a ship or two to have
171360	177840	to wait a day or two, it was never dozens of ships for dozens of days. Transit time from Taiwan to
177840	182960	Los Angeles typically takes about two weeks, so an additional ten days of waiting represents a
182960	190720	near-doubling of shipping times. The root cause of this was, of course, a perfect, pandemic-fueled
190720	196640	storm. As the 2020 holiday season approached, more people were getting back to work in the US,
196640	202480	consumer spending was ticking up, and online shopping was exploding. With limited access to
202480	207600	travel, restaurants, shows, and other services, physical products were one of the few ways
207600	212640	people could spend their discretionary income. More goods than ever were coming from factories
212640	220560	in Asia, and 49.1% of those imports to the US passed through one of just two ports—Los Angeles
220560	227280	and Long Beach. Compared to a year prior, before COVID hit the US in earnest, February 2021 saw a
227280	233120	31% increase in ships and a 49% increase in container traffic at these two ports.
233840	240560	They just couldn't keep up. Simultaneously, however, a significant tranche of dock workers
240560	245840	were constantly out sick due to COVID itself or the quarantine procedures it demanded.
245840	252640	But the disorder doesn't end there. While a year ago a 20-foot container would cost about $1,800,
253360	259280	they now run for $3,500. There's a regional shortage of shipping containers that's having
259280	265520	global consequences. You see, in 2020, just as much of the world entered lockdowns,
265520	270800	China's manufacturing industry was emerging from it. The entire world bought masks,
270800	275120	personal protective equipment, and regular goods from the country, and once those containers
275120	280240	arrived in ports like Long Beach, they were unloaded. However, due to those destination
280240	285920	countries' lockdowns, there wasn't really much that needed to be shipped out. For every 100
285920	292560	containers that are imported into the US, only 40 are exported. So, containers stacked up in
292560	296880	the places they weren't needed, because they weren't needed, and they didn't make it back
296880	302240	to places where they were, like Asia. In the case of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,
302240	306560	their capacity crunch means they don't even have the time to justify loading ships with empty
306560	312400	containers for return to Asia. Not only that, but a shortage of truck drivers in the US means that
312400	317520	it's tough to actually get empty containers back from their final destinations to ports to send
317520	322560	them back to Asia. So, a shortage of shipping containers is worsening a shortage of shipping
322560	326720	capacity, which is worsened by a shortage of port capacity, which is worsening the shortage
326720	331040	of shipping containers, which itself is worsened by a shortage of truck drivers, all of which is
331040	336880	causing a shortage of bubble tea ingredients. Shortages causing shortages causing shortages.
336880	340960	It's a vicious cycle that is only worsening as economies reopen.
341920	348720	Across the world, there's a proliferation of scarcity. Lumber prices in the US quadrupled
348720	354240	after a predicted decline failed to manifest, and a boom in construction and renovation did instead.
354240	359600	The use and construction of pools also accelerated, as outdoor spaces became more valuable, spurring
359600	364160	increased demand for chlorine which, when mixed with reduced supply as a result of a fire at a
364160	370400	major chlorine plant in Louisiana, led to sky-high prices and insufficient availability. As restaurants
370560	375280	pivoted to takeout and delivery, bulk ketchup was out, and single-serve packets were in,
375280	379120	but with manufacturers unwilling to spend significantly to increase production capacity
379120	383680	for a short-term bump, the packets became scarce, and companies started successfully selling them
383680	390960	for $10 per 50 on eBay. However, the greatest shortage of all can be seen here, in the empty
390960	397520	parking lots of Anchorage, Alaska's airport. The state relies heavily on its summer tourism season,
397520	403680	and after missing it last year, 2021 season is crucial. Facing uncertainty about the legality
403680	408480	of their operation until May, cruise companies cancelled many of their summer sailings to Alaska,
408480	414880	so this year is all about independent, domestic tourists. To traverse the vast wilderness of the
414880	421840	last frontier, independent travelers need rental cars. However, these travelers can't get rental
421840	428560	cars. Regardless of which date you search in summer 2021, there simply isn't availability.
428560	435520	For the lucky few who do find one, current market rates are over $500 a day for a compact car.
435520	441600	American travelers can now legally, safely, and easily go to Alaska, but they can't get around
441600	447920	Alaska, which means that eager travelers aren't going. You see, during the depths of the pandemic,
447920	453760	Hertz, Enterprise, National, and other rental car companies sold off much of their fleets of cars.
453760	459120	They needed money somehow, and it wasn't coming from rentals themselves. Now, however, with
459120	466080	vaccinations easily available to all in the US, there is demand for rentals, yet no supply.
466080	471120	In Alaska especially, with its highly seasonal tourism market, it's normal for the rental car
471120	475360	companies to sell off their old vehicles in the fall and purchase new ones in spring, but the
475360	480320	latter half of that didn't happen this year because there's a massive, global shortage of
480320	486160	new cars, and manufacturers are simply unable to fulfill the huge orders rental car companies are
486160	493040	asking for. You see, in spring 2020, as COVID took hold of the globe, car manufacturers cancelled and
493040	497840	reduced their orders for components, as they anticipated reduced demand for new vehicles.
497840	503600	They were right on that—demand did go down as it tends to during any recession, but it recovered
503600	509760	faster than anyone imagined. Regardless, the plan was that, once recovery started, they'd boost
509760	514400	component orders and manufacturing in step. The problem was that they're now at the back of the
514400	521920	line, and for one critical component of modern automobiles, there's quite a long line. Computer
521920	530320	chips are sold out everywhere. It was the perfect storm of circumstances. First, the US's trade war
530320	535920	with China caused the country's manufacturers to start stockpiling the chips. Then, COVID led
535920	540400	to production shutdowns in certain areas of the world, demand for consumer electronics exploded
540400	545680	as people spent more time at home, and now, even the solution is causing problems, as silicon is
545680	551440	both needed in computer chips and vaccine vials. Altogether, the reasons are complex,
551440	557200	but the result is clear. This is why you still can't easily buy a PS5, this is why Samsung likely
557200	562080	won't release a new Galaxy smartphone this year, and this is why you can't get a rental car in
562080	569920	Alaska. In a twist of cruel irony, the car industry is culpable for all of this. That's because,
569920	574880	decades ago, the very industry that is now suffering the hardest propagated a system
574880	581840	that made shortages such as this so possible. Eighty years ago, as Japan emerged from World War
581840	587760	II, Toyota had a problem. The world was marching towards further globalization,
587760	592880	and Japan especially was starting to develop a trade relationship with the US. American car
592880	598800	manufacturers, at the time, though, had a huge cost edge over their Japanese counterparts.
598800	603360	Especially during the post-war economic boom, demand for their vehicles was so high that
603360	610640	American manufacturers had incredible economies of scale. Their process was batch manufacturing—at
610640	615920	a given time, a given assembly line would build one type of one model of one vehicle
615920	622640	exclusively. Then, they'd switch to another type of another model, and so on and so forth. With
622640	627440	this, the manufacturers could use massive production lines working at breakneck pace,
627440	634640	unlike Toyota's. Theirs were small and slow. The domestic car market in Japan was limited,
634640	640080	and it demanded quite a lot of variety in vehicle types. This meant that they didn't have the scale
640080	645840	to make batch manufacturing work well—at least as well as in the US. Their inability to realize
645840	651120	the gains of batch manufacturing meant they simply would have to have higher prices compared to their
651120	657600	new American competitors, but there just wasn't a clear alternative. So, they created one.
658240	665040	They created the Toyota Production System. It had two core principles, starting with
665040	672000	autonomation—not automation, autonomation. It was their term for the efficient use of automation.
672560	678080	Now, complete automation would require machines to build cars, plus diagnose any problems, plus
678080	684400	fix those problems, but having machines fix their own problems is very complicated and very expensive.
685200	690240	So, in their autonomation system, they look for only what machines can do better than humans,
690240	694320	which in their context was most of vehicle assembly and problem diagnosis,
694320	700480	while problem solving was left to humans. Autonomation was, and still is, a crucial,
700480	705200	critical component of the Toyota Production System, but it wasn't the core principle that
705200	711440	would go on to change manufacturing fundamentally. What did was the principle of just-in-time
711440	717280	manufacturing. All it really is is this—each step in the manufacturing process should end
717280	721920	when the next one is ready to start. It's a pull system, as opposed to a push system.
722560	726320	Just as your coffee shop doesn't start making your latte until you ask for it,
726320	730640	the polyvinylbuterol resin should only leave the chemicals plant when the laminated safety glass
730640	734480	production facility is ready to start making windshields, and it should only start making
734480	738480	windshields when the final assembly line is ready to put all the pieces together, and it should only
738480	742240	start putting all the pieces together when the dealership is ready to put more cars on its lot.
742880	748080	In the view of the Toyota Production System, excess inventory is waste because holding
748080	754160	inventory costs money without making money. Elimination of excess inventory is elimination
754160	758320	of waste, and elimination of waste is what leads to production efficiency.
759200	766880	This system worked. In the early 1950s, Toyota was on the brink of bankruptcy. Today, the company is
766880	771440	the largest auto manufacturer in the world, and the principles of the Toyota Production System
771440	778000	can be found in any business textbook. Just-in-time manufacturing is no longer an innovation—it's the
778000	783200	norm. Articles aren't written about companies implementing just-in-time—they're written about
783200	790560	those that don't. In fact, just-in-time has become even more integral today. If there are six steps
790560	796080	in the manufacturing process and each holds two months of inventory, it would take a year to pivot
796080	801840	to producing a new product. The short product life cycles of today's technology industry
801840	807440	would not accept that. Just-in-time is such a simple principle, but the pursuit of the
807440	816160	elimination of waste is now the central mission of any major manufacturer. However, most did it
816160	822480	wrong. Manufacturers globally saw the headline—elimination of inventory leads to massive efficiency
822480	826960	gains—and jumped on that without actually determining what made it work for Toyota.
827520	832160	They ignored that Japan's small physical size made for short domestic supply chains less vulnerable
832160	836800	to things going wrong. They ignored the company's production leveling—finding the average daily
836800	841840	demand and producing that, regardless of short-term changes in demand. They ignored the fact that
841840	846960	eliminating excess inventory is different from eliminating all inventory. They ignored the
846960	850320	principle of growing strong teams of cross-functional workers,
850320	855600	predicated on respecting people. They ignored the culture of stopping and fixing problems,
855600	861200	to get things right the first time. They ignored huge swaths of the Toyota way, and created a
861200	866960	system that's less effective and less resilient, but can impress shareholders through short-term
866960	873920	savings. How Toyota has effectively implemented this system fills books, but many are just reading
873920	882320	the covers. Even Toyota, though, is not perfect. In 2011, Japan was rocked by a 9.0 magnitude
882320	888400	earthquake—the fourth strongest ever recorded anywhere. Not only did this cause immense
888400	894240	destruction to life and property, but it also led Toyota to recognize a flaw in its own system.
894880	900640	As Japan recovered, some supply chains were quick to as well—for example, securing plastic resin
900640	906160	for door panel production is not difficult. There are plenty of manufacturers globally creating
906160	913920	easily substitutable alternatives. That's not the case with, say, semiconductors. The hugely
913920	919360	expensive facilities that create these chips require years to construct, and after the 2011
919360	925680	earthquake, it took many months to mend them back to operating status. This surfaced a truth that
925680	932800	had never been fully considered. Not all supply chains are made equal. Plastic resin can handle
932800	940000	supply chain disruption. Semiconductors cannot. Therefore, Toyota made changes.
940720	947040	All along, their mission was not to eliminate inventory full stop—it was to eliminate excess
947040	953200	inventory. Supply chain disruption is inevitable. It's inevitable in the same way that Titanic's
953200	956640	flawed design would eventually encounter an iceberg, or the structural economic
956640	962400	vulnerabilities of 2008 would eventually collide with a market panic. Therefore, semiconductor
962400	967680	inventory is not excess because, inevitably, due to the inevitability of disruption,
968240	975280	excess semiconductor inventory will eventually become necessary. Recognizing this, Toyota,
975280	980320	in recent years, has started to build up a stockpile of two to six months' worth of chips,
980320	985600	and that's why the company is the only major vehicle manufacturer that is unfazed by the
985600	992240	semiconductor shortage. Toyota followed its own principles—it did not stray from them,
992240	997680	and it did not reinvent them. It's no surprise that Toyota excels at implementing its own system,
997680	1003120	but it is a surprise that the entire manufacturing world has so wholeheartedly embraced flawed
1003120	1009280	implementation of the system. The reality is that just-in-time manufacturing is more efficient,
1009280	1015120	but some think that that efficiency must come with a trade-off in resilience. That's simply
1015120	1021120	not true. Proper just-in-time supply chains must inherently be inflexible once formed,
1021120	1028480	but their form is flexible. It's a philosophy, not an equation. Shortages in an economy are
1028480	1033280	incredibly complex, and any explanation of them is an oversimplification, but just-in-time
1033280	1040640	manufacturing does not have to be the cause. In addition, disruption is inevitable, so it can't
1040640	1045600	be the cause. You can't blame the fact that your house is sinking on the fact that you built it
1045600	1052160	in the ocean. A ruthless pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of long-term gain is the
1052160	1058000	cause. Running as close as possible to the edge is the most efficient manner to manufacture…
1058560	1063840	until it isn't. Constructing a resilient supply chain requires long-term thinking,
1063840	1067920	but most companies have not nurtured an environment that allows for that.
1068560	1073840	As the world recovers from the pandemic, many will ditch what they call just-in-time manufacturing,
1073840	1077920	as the alternative is to accept that the very people in charge of those companies
1077920	1084560	haven't implemented it properly. To be fair, few have, and even Toyota is still learning how to
1084560	1090800	best implement its own system. However, Toyota has proven that strict adherence to its principles
1090800	1097040	means just-in-time manufacturing can be everything at once—it can be both efficient and resilient,
1097040	1102800	if one knows what is truly excess. Proper implementation of the Toyota system
1102800	1108560	won't fix every shortage, but it did fix one shortage for one company. Therefore,
1108560	1112480	if the auto industry had built a stockpile of critical components, if it had implemented
1112480	1116880	production leveling more strictly, and if it had understood vulnerabilities in inbound supply
1116880	1123920	chains, Alaska would have its rental cars. Unlike the world of physical goods, it's
1123920	1130960	impossible to manufacture new website domains. Once one is gone, it's gone for good. Therefore,
1130960	1135600	that's why, whenever I have a new idea for a YouTube channel, a podcast, or anything,
1135600	1141760	my first step is to buy the domain on Hover. Their transparent, straightforward, and fair pricing
1141760	1146080	means that I know I'm getting a good deal, and it's pretty important to have your domain secured
1146080	1150640	if whatever you're doing has a chance of growing. If I didn't get the WendoverProductions.com
1150640	1155920	domain, I'm sure someone would have snatched it up as soon as the channel grew. I use that not only
1155920	1161360	for the website itself, but also for email. Hover lets you set up a custom email address at a custom
1161360	1165520	domain in quite literally seconds, and now when I send emails to someone I want to interview,
1165520	1169280	for example, they see that it's from a professional-looking address, rather than one
1169280	1174480	ending in Gmail, Yahoo, or iCloud, and I have a better chance of success. To grab your domain
1174480	1179120	before it's gone, and set up a professional custom email address, all for 10% off, head
1179120	1186320	to Hover.com slash Wendover, and you'll be helping support the channel while you're at it.
