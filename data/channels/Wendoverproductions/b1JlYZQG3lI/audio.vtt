00:12.400 --> 00:18.560
what caused all the shortages of 2020 and 2021. That's it. COVID-19 caused these shortages in

00:18.560 --> 00:23.840
the same way that an iceberg caused the Titanic to sink, or the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused

00:23.840 --> 00:30.320
the Great Recession, or the straw broke the camel's back. That's really to say, COVID did

00:30.320 --> 00:35.200
cause these shortages. They would not have happened in the manner they did when they did,

00:35.200 --> 00:40.480
if not for the pandemic. But just as the Titanic's design flaws would eventually lead to calamity,

00:40.480 --> 00:44.480
the vulnerabilities in the global economy would eventually lead to a recession, and something

00:44.480 --> 00:50.720
would eventually break the overloaded camel's back, COVID caused these shortages, but it's not

00:50.720 --> 00:57.920
what made them possible. What made them possible is a fundamental, structural vulnerability in the

00:57.920 --> 01:06.080
way today's supply chains work. On April 13th, 2021, Boba Bliss, a small bubble tea shop in

01:06.080 --> 01:11.360
Dublin, California, posted on Facebook. They explained that they were having a hard time

01:11.360 --> 01:15.040
getting their ingredients, and that this would mean their menu would have to change daily,

01:15.040 --> 01:19.520
reflective of what they could actually get from their supplier. On April 15th,

01:19.520 --> 01:24.320
Mighty Boba, in Canandaigua, New York, explained on Facebook that they would have to serve a

01:24.320 --> 01:29.840
smaller quantity of tapioca pearls in each drink, and would no longer be offering extra as an option

01:29.840 --> 01:35.360
due to a shortage of this ingredient. Bing's Boba Tea in Tucson, Arizona said much the same

01:35.360 --> 01:39.760
one week later, and Tea Hut in San Francisco, California then announced that they would have

01:39.760 --> 01:46.400
to raise their prices due to a 26% rise in their ingredient costs. All across the country,

01:46.400 --> 01:51.680
shops selling this popular Taiwanese drink simply could not get ingredients in the quantities

01:51.680 --> 01:59.040
demanded, despite no dramatic increase in demand. However, thousands of miles away, in Taiwan,

01:59.040 --> 02:04.160
where much of the world's bubble tea ingredients are made, things were operating fairly normally.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.640
With single-digit daily case numbers for much of COVID's reign, factories on the island were

02:08.640 --> 02:14.720
able to work at full force in a way they couldn't elsewhere, but still, somehow, Boba Bliss,

02:14.720 --> 02:20.800
Mighty Boba, Bing's Boba Tea, Tea Hut, and thousands of other shops across the US couldn't

02:20.800 --> 02:26.080
get their product. The problem had less to do with anything happening in Taiwan, and more with

02:26.080 --> 02:32.720
what was happening here—in the waters, off the coast of Los Angeles. Throughout the first half

02:32.720 --> 02:39.840
of 2021, a rotating cast of dozens of cargo ships have dotted the Pacific's horizon. Each sat there,

02:39.840 --> 02:45.040
at anchor, sometimes for weeks, until a spot opened for them at the port of Los Angeles or

02:45.040 --> 02:51.360
Long Beach. This is abnormal. While the year prior it was possible for a ship or two to have

02:51.360 --> 02:57.840
to wait a day or two, it was never dozens of ships for dozens of days. Transit time from Taiwan to

02:57.840 --> 03:02.960
Los Angeles typically takes about two weeks, so an additional ten days of waiting represents a

03:02.960 --> 03:10.720
near-doubling of shipping times. The root cause of this was, of course, a perfect, pandemic-fueled

03:10.720 --> 03:16.640
storm. As the 2020 holiday season approached, more people were getting back to work in the US,

03:16.640 --> 03:22.480
consumer spending was ticking up, and online shopping was exploding. With limited access to

03:22.480 --> 03:27.600
travel, restaurants, shows, and other services, physical products were one of the few ways

03:27.600 --> 03:32.640
people could spend their discretionary income. More goods than ever were coming from factories

03:32.640 --> 03:40.560
in Asia, and 49.1% of those imports to the US passed through one of just two ports—Los Angeles

03:40.560 --> 03:47.280
and Long Beach. Compared to a year prior, before COVID hit the US in earnest, February 2021 saw a

03:47.280 --> 03:53.120
31% increase in ships and a 49% increase in container traffic at these two ports.

03:53.840 --> 04:00.560
They just couldn't keep up. Simultaneously, however, a significant tranche of dock workers

04:00.560 --> 04:05.840
were constantly out sick due to COVID itself or the quarantine procedures it demanded.

04:05.840 --> 04:12.640
But the disorder doesn't end there. While a year ago a 20-foot container would cost about $1,800,

04:13.360 --> 04:19.280
they now run for $3,500. There's a regional shortage of shipping containers that's having

04:19.280 --> 04:25.520
global consequences. You see, in 2020, just as much of the world entered lockdowns,

04:25.520 --> 04:30.800
China's manufacturing industry was emerging from it. The entire world bought masks,

04:30.800 --> 04:35.120
personal protective equipment, and regular goods from the country, and once those containers

04:35.120 --> 04:40.240
arrived in ports like Long Beach, they were unloaded. However, due to those destination

04:40.240 --> 04:45.920
countries' lockdowns, there wasn't really much that needed to be shipped out. For every 100

04:45.920 --> 04:52.560
containers that are imported into the US, only 40 are exported. So, containers stacked up in

04:52.560 --> 04:56.880
the places they weren't needed, because they weren't needed, and they didn't make it back

04:56.880 --> 05:02.240
to places where they were, like Asia. In the case of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,

05:02.240 --> 05:06.560
their capacity crunch means they don't even have the time to justify loading ships with empty

05:06.560 --> 05:12.400
containers for return to Asia. Not only that, but a shortage of truck drivers in the US means that

05:12.400 --> 05:17.520
it's tough to actually get empty containers back from their final destinations to ports to send

05:17.520 --> 05:22.560
them back to Asia. So, a shortage of shipping containers is worsening a shortage of shipping

05:22.560 --> 05:26.720
capacity, which is worsened by a shortage of port capacity, which is worsening the shortage

05:26.720 --> 05:31.040
of shipping containers, which itself is worsened by a shortage of truck drivers, all of which is

05:31.040 --> 05:36.880
causing a shortage of bubble tea ingredients. Shortages causing shortages causing shortages.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.960
It's a vicious cycle that is only worsening as economies reopen.

05:41.920 --> 05:48.720
Across the world, there's a proliferation of scarcity. Lumber prices in the US quadrupled

05:48.720 --> 05:54.240
after a predicted decline failed to manifest, and a boom in construction and renovation did instead.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.600
The use and construction of pools also accelerated, as outdoor spaces became more valuable, spurring

05:59.600 --> 06:04.160
increased demand for chlorine which, when mixed with reduced supply as a result of a fire at a

06:04.160 --> 06:10.400
major chlorine plant in Louisiana, led to sky-high prices and insufficient availability. As restaurants

06:10.560 --> 06:15.280
pivoted to takeout and delivery, bulk ketchup was out, and single-serve packets were in,

06:15.280 --> 06:19.120
but with manufacturers unwilling to spend significantly to increase production capacity

06:19.120 --> 06:23.680
for a short-term bump, the packets became scarce, and companies started successfully selling them

06:23.680 --> 06:30.960
for $10 per 50 on eBay. However, the greatest shortage of all can be seen here, in the empty

06:30.960 --> 06:37.520
parking lots of Anchorage, Alaska's airport. The state relies heavily on its summer tourism season,

06:37.520 --> 06:43.680
and after missing it last year, 2021 season is crucial. Facing uncertainty about the legality

06:43.680 --> 06:48.480
of their operation until May, cruise companies cancelled many of their summer sailings to Alaska,

06:48.480 --> 06:54.880
so this year is all about independent, domestic tourists. To traverse the vast wilderness of the

06:54.880 --> 07:01.840
last frontier, independent travelers need rental cars. However, these travelers can't get rental

07:01.840 --> 07:08.560
cars. Regardless of which date you search in summer 2021, there simply isn't availability.

07:08.560 --> 07:15.520
For the lucky few who do find one, current market rates are over $500 a day for a compact car.

07:15.520 --> 07:21.600
American travelers can now legally, safely, and easily go to Alaska, but they can't get around

07:21.600 --> 07:27.920
Alaska, which means that eager travelers aren't going. You see, during the depths of the pandemic,

07:27.920 --> 07:33.760
Hertz, Enterprise, National, and other rental car companies sold off much of their fleets of cars.

07:33.760 --> 07:39.120
They needed money somehow, and it wasn't coming from rentals themselves. Now, however, with

07:39.120 --> 07:46.080
vaccinations easily available to all in the US, there is demand for rentals, yet no supply.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.120
In Alaska especially, with its highly seasonal tourism market, it's normal for the rental car

07:51.120 --> 07:55.360
companies to sell off their old vehicles in the fall and purchase new ones in spring, but the

07:55.360 --> 08:00.320
latter half of that didn't happen this year because there's a massive, global shortage of

08:00.320 --> 08:06.160
new cars, and manufacturers are simply unable to fulfill the huge orders rental car companies are

08:06.160 --> 08:13.040
asking for. You see, in spring 2020, as COVID took hold of the globe, car manufacturers cancelled and

08:13.040 --> 08:17.840
reduced their orders for components, as they anticipated reduced demand for new vehicles.

08:17.840 --> 08:23.600
They were right on that—demand did go down as it tends to during any recession, but it recovered

08:23.600 --> 08:29.760
faster than anyone imagined. Regardless, the plan was that, once recovery started, they'd boost

08:29.760 --> 08:34.400
component orders and manufacturing in step. The problem was that they're now at the back of the

08:34.400 --> 08:41.920
line, and for one critical component of modern automobiles, there's quite a long line. Computer

08:41.920 --> 08:50.320
chips are sold out everywhere. It was the perfect storm of circumstances. First, the US's trade war

08:50.320 --> 08:55.920
with China caused the country's manufacturers to start stockpiling the chips. Then, COVID led

08:55.920 --> 09:00.400
to production shutdowns in certain areas of the world, demand for consumer electronics exploded

09:00.400 --> 09:05.680
as people spent more time at home, and now, even the solution is causing problems, as silicon is

09:05.680 --> 09:11.440
both needed in computer chips and vaccine vials. Altogether, the reasons are complex,

09:11.440 --> 09:17.200
but the result is clear. This is why you still can't easily buy a PS5, this is why Samsung likely

09:17.200 --> 09:22.080
won't release a new Galaxy smartphone this year, and this is why you can't get a rental car in

09:22.080 --> 09:29.920
Alaska. In a twist of cruel irony, the car industry is culpable for all of this. That's because,

09:29.920 --> 09:34.880
decades ago, the very industry that is now suffering the hardest propagated a system

09:34.880 --> 09:41.840
that made shortages such as this so possible. Eighty years ago, as Japan emerged from World War

09:41.840 --> 09:47.760
II, Toyota had a problem. The world was marching towards further globalization,

09:47.760 --> 09:52.880
and Japan especially was starting to develop a trade relationship with the US. American car

09:52.880 --> 09:58.800
manufacturers, at the time, though, had a huge cost edge over their Japanese counterparts.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.360
Especially during the post-war economic boom, demand for their vehicles was so high that

10:03.360 --> 10:10.640
American manufacturers had incredible economies of scale. Their process was batch manufacturing—at

10:10.640 --> 10:15.920
a given time, a given assembly line would build one type of one model of one vehicle

10:15.920 --> 10:22.640
exclusively. Then, they'd switch to another type of another model, and so on and so forth. With

10:22.640 --> 10:27.440
this, the manufacturers could use massive production lines working at breakneck pace,

10:27.440 --> 10:34.640
unlike Toyota's. Theirs were small and slow. The domestic car market in Japan was limited,

10:34.640 --> 10:40.080
and it demanded quite a lot of variety in vehicle types. This meant that they didn't have the scale

10:40.080 --> 10:45.840
to make batch manufacturing work well—at least as well as in the US. Their inability to realize

10:45.840 --> 10:51.120
the gains of batch manufacturing meant they simply would have to have higher prices compared to their

10:51.120 --> 10:57.600
new American competitors, but there just wasn't a clear alternative. So, they created one.

10:58.240 --> 11:05.040
They created the Toyota Production System. It had two core principles, starting with

11:05.040 --> 11:12.000
autonomation—not automation, autonomation. It was their term for the efficient use of automation.

11:12.560 --> 11:18.080
Now, complete automation would require machines to build cars, plus diagnose any problems, plus

11:18.080 --> 11:24.400
fix those problems, but having machines fix their own problems is very complicated and very expensive.

11:25.200 --> 11:30.240
So, in their autonomation system, they look for only what machines can do better than humans,

11:30.240 --> 11:34.320
which in their context was most of vehicle assembly and problem diagnosis,

11:34.320 --> 11:40.480
while problem solving was left to humans. Autonomation was, and still is, a crucial,

11:40.480 --> 11:45.200
critical component of the Toyota Production System, but it wasn't the core principle that

11:45.200 --> 11:51.440
would go on to change manufacturing fundamentally. What did was the principle of just-in-time

11:51.440 --> 11:57.280
manufacturing. All it really is is this—each step in the manufacturing process should end

11:57.280 --> 12:01.920
when the next one is ready to start. It's a pull system, as opposed to a push system.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.320
Just as your coffee shop doesn't start making your latte until you ask for it,

12:06.320 --> 12:10.640
the polyvinylbuterol resin should only leave the chemicals plant when the laminated safety glass

12:10.640 --> 12:14.480
production facility is ready to start making windshields, and it should only start making

12:14.480 --> 12:18.480
windshields when the final assembly line is ready to put all the pieces together, and it should only

12:18.480 --> 12:22.240
start putting all the pieces together when the dealership is ready to put more cars on its lot.

12:22.880 --> 12:28.080
In the view of the Toyota Production System, excess inventory is waste because holding

12:28.080 --> 12:34.160
inventory costs money without making money. Elimination of excess inventory is elimination

12:34.160 --> 12:38.320
of waste, and elimination of waste is what leads to production efficiency.

12:39.200 --> 12:46.880
This system worked. In the early 1950s, Toyota was on the brink of bankruptcy. Today, the company is

12:46.880 --> 12:51.440
the largest auto manufacturer in the world, and the principles of the Toyota Production System

12:51.440 --> 12:58.000
can be found in any business textbook. Just-in-time manufacturing is no longer an innovation—it's the

12:58.000 --> 13:03.200
norm. Articles aren't written about companies implementing just-in-time—they're written about

13:03.200 --> 13:10.560
those that don't. In fact, just-in-time has become even more integral today. If there are six steps

13:10.560 --> 13:16.080
in the manufacturing process and each holds two months of inventory, it would take a year to pivot

13:16.080 --> 13:21.840
to producing a new product. The short product life cycles of today's technology industry

13:21.840 --> 13:27.440
would not accept that. Just-in-time is such a simple principle, but the pursuit of the

13:27.440 --> 13:36.160
elimination of waste is now the central mission of any major manufacturer. However, most did it

13:36.160 --> 13:42.480
wrong. Manufacturers globally saw the headline—elimination of inventory leads to massive efficiency

13:42.480 --> 13:46.960
gains—and jumped on that without actually determining what made it work for Toyota.

13:47.520 --> 13:52.160
They ignored that Japan's small physical size made for short domestic supply chains less vulnerable

13:52.160 --> 13:56.800
to things going wrong. They ignored the company's production leveling—finding the average daily

13:56.800 --> 14:01.840
demand and producing that, regardless of short-term changes in demand. They ignored the fact that

14:01.840 --> 14:06.960
eliminating excess inventory is different from eliminating all inventory. They ignored the

14:06.960 --> 14:10.320
principle of growing strong teams of cross-functional workers,

14:10.320 --> 14:15.600
predicated on respecting people. They ignored the culture of stopping and fixing problems,

14:15.600 --> 14:21.200
to get things right the first time. They ignored huge swaths of the Toyota way, and created a

14:21.200 --> 14:26.960
system that's less effective and less resilient, but can impress shareholders through short-term

14:26.960 --> 14:33.920
savings. How Toyota has effectively implemented this system fills books, but many are just reading

14:33.920 --> 14:42.320
the covers. Even Toyota, though, is not perfect. In 2011, Japan was rocked by a 9.0 magnitude

14:42.320 --> 14:48.400
earthquake—the fourth strongest ever recorded anywhere. Not only did this cause immense

14:48.400 --> 14:54.240
destruction to life and property, but it also led Toyota to recognize a flaw in its own system.

14:54.880 --> 15:00.640
As Japan recovered, some supply chains were quick to as well—for example, securing plastic resin

15:00.640 --> 15:06.160
for door panel production is not difficult. There are plenty of manufacturers globally creating

15:06.160 --> 15:13.920
easily substitutable alternatives. That's not the case with, say, semiconductors. The hugely

15:13.920 --> 15:19.360
expensive facilities that create these chips require years to construct, and after the 2011

15:19.360 --> 15:25.680
earthquake, it took many months to mend them back to operating status. This surfaced a truth that

15:25.680 --> 15:32.800
had never been fully considered. Not all supply chains are made equal. Plastic resin can handle

15:32.800 --> 15:40.000
supply chain disruption. Semiconductors cannot. Therefore, Toyota made changes.

15:40.720 --> 15:47.040
All along, their mission was not to eliminate inventory full stop—it was to eliminate excess

15:47.040 --> 15:53.200
inventory. Supply chain disruption is inevitable. It's inevitable in the same way that Titanic's

15:53.200 --> 15:56.640
flawed design would eventually encounter an iceberg, or the structural economic

15:56.640 --> 16:02.400
vulnerabilities of 2008 would eventually collide with a market panic. Therefore, semiconductor

16:02.400 --> 16:07.680
inventory is not excess because, inevitably, due to the inevitability of disruption,

16:08.240 --> 16:15.280
excess semiconductor inventory will eventually become necessary. Recognizing this, Toyota,

16:15.280 --> 16:20.320
in recent years, has started to build up a stockpile of two to six months' worth of chips,

16:20.320 --> 16:25.600
and that's why the company is the only major vehicle manufacturer that is unfazed by the

16:25.600 --> 16:32.240
semiconductor shortage. Toyota followed its own principles—it did not stray from them,

16:32.240 --> 16:37.680
and it did not reinvent them. It's no surprise that Toyota excels at implementing its own system,

16:37.680 --> 16:43.120
but it is a surprise that the entire manufacturing world has so wholeheartedly embraced flawed

16:43.120 --> 16:49.280
implementation of the system. The reality is that just-in-time manufacturing is more efficient,

16:49.280 --> 16:55.120
but some think that that efficiency must come with a trade-off in resilience. That's simply

16:55.120 --> 17:01.120
not true. Proper just-in-time supply chains must inherently be inflexible once formed,

17:01.120 --> 17:08.480
but their form is flexible. It's a philosophy, not an equation. Shortages in an economy are

17:08.480 --> 17:13.280
incredibly complex, and any explanation of them is an oversimplification, but just-in-time

17:13.280 --> 17:20.640
manufacturing does not have to be the cause. In addition, disruption is inevitable, so it can't

17:20.640 --> 17:25.600
be the cause. You can't blame the fact that your house is sinking on the fact that you built it

17:25.600 --> 17:32.160
in the ocean. A ruthless pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of long-term gain is the

17:32.160 --> 17:38.000
cause. Running as close as possible to the edge is the most efficient manner to manufacture…

17:38.560 --> 17:43.840
until it isn't. Constructing a resilient supply chain requires long-term thinking,

17:43.840 --> 17:47.920
but most companies have not nurtured an environment that allows for that.

17:48.560 --> 17:53.840
As the world recovers from the pandemic, many will ditch what they call just-in-time manufacturing,

17:53.840 --> 17:57.920
as the alternative is to accept that the very people in charge of those companies

17:57.920 --> 18:04.560
haven't implemented it properly. To be fair, few have, and even Toyota is still learning how to

18:04.560 --> 18:10.800
best implement its own system. However, Toyota has proven that strict adherence to its principles

18:10.800 --> 18:17.040
means just-in-time manufacturing can be everything at once—it can be both efficient and resilient,

18:17.040 --> 18:22.800
if one knows what is truly excess. Proper implementation of the Toyota system

18:22.800 --> 18:28.560
won't fix every shortage, but it did fix one shortage for one company. Therefore,

18:28.560 --> 18:32.480
if the auto industry had built a stockpile of critical components, if it had implemented

18:32.480 --> 18:36.880
production leveling more strictly, and if it had understood vulnerabilities in inbound supply

18:36.880 --> 18:43.920
chains, Alaska would have its rental cars. Unlike the world of physical goods, it's

18:43.920 --> 18:50.960
impossible to manufacture new website domains. Once one is gone, it's gone for good. Therefore,

18:50.960 --> 18:55.600
that's why, whenever I have a new idea for a YouTube channel, a podcast, or anything,

18:55.600 --> 19:01.760
my first step is to buy the domain on Hover. Their transparent, straightforward, and fair pricing

19:01.760 --> 19:06.080
means that I know I'm getting a good deal, and it's pretty important to have your domain secured

19:06.080 --> 19:10.640
if whatever you're doing has a chance of growing. If I didn't get the WendoverProductions.com

19:10.640 --> 19:15.920
domain, I'm sure someone would have snatched it up as soon as the channel grew. I use that not only

19:15.920 --> 19:21.360
for the website itself, but also for email. Hover lets you set up a custom email address at a custom

19:21.360 --> 19:25.520
domain in quite literally seconds, and now when I send emails to someone I want to interview,

19:25.520 --> 19:29.280
for example, they see that it's from a professional-looking address, rather than one

19:29.280 --> 19:34.480
ending in Gmail, Yahoo, or iCloud, and I have a better chance of success. To grab your domain

19:34.480 --> 19:39.120
before it's gone, and set up a professional custom email address, all for 10% off, head

19:39.120 --> 19:46.320
to Hover.com slash Wendover, and you'll be helping support the channel while you're at it.
