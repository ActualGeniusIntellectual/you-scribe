address at hover.com slash wendover. COVID-19—that's the answer. That's

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,560
what caused all the shortages of 2020 and 2021. That's it. COVID-19 caused these shortages in

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,840
the same way that an iceberg caused the Titanic to sink, or the collapse of Lehman Brothers caused

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,320
the Great Recession, or the straw broke the camel's back. That's really to say, COVID did

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,200
cause these shortages. They would not have happened in the manner they did when they did,

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,480
if not for the pandemic. But just as the Titanic's design flaws would eventually lead to calamity,

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
the vulnerabilities in the global economy would eventually lead to a recession, and something

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,720
would eventually break the overloaded camel's back, COVID caused these shortages, but it's not

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,920
what made them possible. What made them possible is a fundamental, structural vulnerability in the

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,080
way today's supply chains work. On April 13th, 2021, Boba Bliss, a small bubble tea shop in

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,360
Dublin, California, posted on Facebook. They explained that they were having a hard time

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
getting their ingredients, and that this would mean their menu would have to change daily,

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
reflective of what they could actually get from their supplier. On April 15th,

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,320
Mighty Boba, in Canandaigua, New York, explained on Facebook that they would have to serve a

16
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,840
smaller quantity of tapioca pearls in each drink, and would no longer be offering extra as an option

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,360
due to a shortage of this ingredient. Bing's Boba Tea in Tucson, Arizona said much the same

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,760
one week later, and Tea Hut in San Francisco, California then announced that they would have

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,400
to raise their prices due to a 26% rise in their ingredient costs. All across the country,

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,680
shops selling this popular Taiwanese drink simply could not get ingredients in the quantities

21
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,040
demanded, despite no dramatic increase in demand. However, thousands of miles away, in Taiwan,

22
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,160
where much of the world's bubble tea ingredients are made, things were operating fairly normally.

23
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,640
With single-digit daily case numbers for much of COVID's reign, factories on the island were

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,720
able to work at full force in a way they couldn't elsewhere, but still, somehow, Boba Bliss,

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,800
Mighty Boba, Bing's Boba Tea, Tea Hut, and thousands of other shops across the US couldn't

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,080
get their product. The problem had less to do with anything happening in Taiwan, and more with

27
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,720
what was happening here—in the waters, off the coast of Los Angeles. Throughout the first half

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,840
of 2021, a rotating cast of dozens of cargo ships have dotted the Pacific's horizon. Each sat there,

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,040
at anchor, sometimes for weeks, until a spot opened for them at the port of Los Angeles or

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,360
Long Beach. This is abnormal. While the year prior it was possible for a ship or two to have

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,840
to wait a day or two, it was never dozens of ships for dozens of days. Transit time from Taiwan to

32
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,960
Los Angeles typically takes about two weeks, so an additional ten days of waiting represents a

33
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,720
near-doubling of shipping times. The root cause of this was, of course, a perfect, pandemic-fueled

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,640
storm. As the 2020 holiday season approached, more people were getting back to work in the US,

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,480
consumer spending was ticking up, and online shopping was exploding. With limited access to

36
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,600
travel, restaurants, shows, and other services, physical products were one of the few ways

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,640
people could spend their discretionary income. More goods than ever were coming from factories

38
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,560
in Asia, and 49.1% of those imports to the US passed through one of just two ports—Los Angeles

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,280
and Long Beach. Compared to a year prior, before COVID hit the US in earnest, February 2021 saw a

40
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,120
31% increase in ships and a 49% increase in container traffic at these two ports.

41
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,560
They just couldn't keep up. Simultaneously, however, a significant tranche of dock workers

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,840
were constantly out sick due to COVID itself or the quarantine procedures it demanded.

43
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,640
But the disorder doesn't end there. While a year ago a 20-foot container would cost about $1,800,

44
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,280
they now run for $3,500. There's a regional shortage of shipping containers that's having

45
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,520
global consequences. You see, in 2020, just as much of the world entered lockdowns,

46
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,800
China's manufacturing industry was emerging from it. The entire world bought masks,

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
personal protective equipment, and regular goods from the country, and once those containers

48
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,240
arrived in ports like Long Beach, they were unloaded. However, due to those destination

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,920
countries' lockdowns, there wasn't really much that needed to be shipped out. For every 100

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,560
containers that are imported into the US, only 40 are exported. So, containers stacked up in

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,880
the places they weren't needed, because they weren't needed, and they didn't make it back

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,240
to places where they were, like Asia. In the case of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach,

53
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,560
their capacity crunch means they don't even have the time to justify loading ships with empty

54
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,400
containers for return to Asia. Not only that, but a shortage of truck drivers in the US means that

55
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,520
it's tough to actually get empty containers back from their final destinations to ports to send

56
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,560
them back to Asia. So, a shortage of shipping containers is worsening a shortage of shipping

57
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
capacity, which is worsened by a shortage of port capacity, which is worsening the shortage

58
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,040
of shipping containers, which itself is worsened by a shortage of truck drivers, all of which is

59
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,880
causing a shortage of bubble tea ingredients. Shortages causing shortages causing shortages.

60
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
It's a vicious cycle that is only worsening as economies reopen.

61
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,720
Across the world, there's a proliferation of scarcity. Lumber prices in the US quadrupled

62
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,240
after a predicted decline failed to manifest, and a boom in construction and renovation did instead.

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,600
The use and construction of pools also accelerated, as outdoor spaces became more valuable, spurring

64
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,160
increased demand for chlorine which, when mixed with reduced supply as a result of a fire at a

65
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,400
major chlorine plant in Louisiana, led to sky-high prices and insufficient availability. As restaurants

66
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,280
pivoted to takeout and delivery, bulk ketchup was out, and single-serve packets were in,

67
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,120
but with manufacturers unwilling to spend significantly to increase production capacity

68
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
for a short-term bump, the packets became scarce, and companies started successfully selling them

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,960
for $10 per 50 on eBay. However, the greatest shortage of all can be seen here, in the empty

70
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,520
parking lots of Anchorage, Alaska's airport. The state relies heavily on its summer tourism season,

71
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,680
and after missing it last year, 2021 season is crucial. Facing uncertainty about the legality

72
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,480
of their operation until May, cruise companies cancelled many of their summer sailings to Alaska,

73
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:54,880
so this year is all about independent, domestic tourists. To traverse the vast wilderness of the

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,840
last frontier, independent travelers need rental cars. However, these travelers can't get rental

75
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,560
cars. Regardless of which date you search in summer 2021, there simply isn't availability.

76
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,520
For the lucky few who do find one, current market rates are over $500 a day for a compact car.

77
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,600
American travelers can now legally, safely, and easily go to Alaska, but they can't get around

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,920
Alaska, which means that eager travelers aren't going. You see, during the depths of the pandemic,

79
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Hertz, Enterprise, National, and other rental car companies sold off much of their fleets of cars.

80
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,120
They needed money somehow, and it wasn't coming from rentals themselves. Now, however, with

81
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,080
vaccinations easily available to all in the US, there is demand for rentals, yet no supply.

82
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,120
In Alaska especially, with its highly seasonal tourism market, it's normal for the rental car

83
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,360
companies to sell off their old vehicles in the fall and purchase new ones in spring, but the

84
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,320
latter half of that didn't happen this year because there's a massive, global shortage of

85
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,160
new cars, and manufacturers are simply unable to fulfill the huge orders rental car companies are

86
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,040
asking for. You see, in spring 2020, as COVID took hold of the globe, car manufacturers cancelled and

87
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,840
reduced their orders for components, as they anticipated reduced demand for new vehicles.

88
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,600
They were right on that—demand did go down as it tends to during any recession, but it recovered

89
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,760
faster than anyone imagined. Regardless, the plan was that, once recovery started, they'd boost

90
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,400
component orders and manufacturing in step. The problem was that they're now at the back of the

91
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,920
line, and for one critical component of modern automobiles, there's quite a long line. Computer

92
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:50,320
chips are sold out everywhere. It was the perfect storm of circumstances. First, the US's trade war

93
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,920
with China caused the country's manufacturers to start stockpiling the chips. Then, COVID led

94
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,400
to production shutdowns in certain areas of the world, demand for consumer electronics exploded

95
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,680
as people spent more time at home, and now, even the solution is causing problems, as silicon is

96
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,440
both needed in computer chips and vaccine vials. Altogether, the reasons are complex,

97
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,200
but the result is clear. This is why you still can't easily buy a PS5, this is why Samsung likely

98
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,080
won't release a new Galaxy smartphone this year, and this is why you can't get a rental car in

99
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,920
Alaska. In a twist of cruel irony, the car industry is culpable for all of this. That's because,

100
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,880
decades ago, the very industry that is now suffering the hardest propagated a system

101
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,840
that made shortages such as this so possible. Eighty years ago, as Japan emerged from World War

102
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,760
II, Toyota had a problem. The world was marching towards further globalization,

103
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,880
and Japan especially was starting to develop a trade relationship with the US. American car

104
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,800
manufacturers, at the time, though, had a huge cost edge over their Japanese counterparts.

105
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,360
Especially during the post-war economic boom, demand for their vehicles was so high that

106
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,640
American manufacturers had incredible economies of scale. Their process was batch manufacturing—at

107
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,920
a given time, a given assembly line would build one type of one model of one vehicle

108
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:22,640
exclusively. Then, they'd switch to another type of another model, and so on and so forth. With

109
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,440
this, the manufacturers could use massive production lines working at breakneck pace,

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,640
unlike Toyota's. Theirs were small and slow. The domestic car market in Japan was limited,

111
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,080
and it demanded quite a lot of variety in vehicle types. This meant that they didn't have the scale

112
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,840
to make batch manufacturing work well—at least as well as in the US. Their inability to realize

113
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:51,120
the gains of batch manufacturing meant they simply would have to have higher prices compared to their

114
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,600
new American competitors, but there just wasn't a clear alternative. So, they created one.

115
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:05,040
They created the Toyota Production System. It had two core principles, starting with

116
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,000
autonomation—not automation, autonomation. It was their term for the efficient use of automation.

117
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,080
Now, complete automation would require machines to build cars, plus diagnose any problems, plus

118
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:24,400
fix those problems, but having machines fix their own problems is very complicated and very expensive.

119
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,240
So, in their autonomation system, they look for only what machines can do better than humans,

120
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
which in their context was most of vehicle assembly and problem diagnosis,

121
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,480
while problem solving was left to humans. Autonomation was, and still is, a crucial,

122
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,200
critical component of the Toyota Production System, but it wasn't the core principle that

123
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,440
would go on to change manufacturing fundamentally. What did was the principle of just-in-time

124
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,280
manufacturing. All it really is is this—each step in the manufacturing process should end

125
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,920
when the next one is ready to start. It's a pull system, as opposed to a push system.

126
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,320
Just as your coffee shop doesn't start making your latte until you ask for it,

127
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,640
the polyvinylbuterol resin should only leave the chemicals plant when the laminated safety glass

128
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,480
production facility is ready to start making windshields, and it should only start making

129
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,480
windshields when the final assembly line is ready to put all the pieces together, and it should only

130
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
start putting all the pieces together when the dealership is ready to put more cars on its lot.

131
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,080
In the view of the Toyota Production System, excess inventory is waste because holding

132
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:34,160
inventory costs money without making money. Elimination of excess inventory is elimination

133
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,320
of waste, and elimination of waste is what leads to production efficiency.

134
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,880
This system worked. In the early 1950s, Toyota was on the brink of bankruptcy. Today, the company is

135
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,440
the largest auto manufacturer in the world, and the principles of the Toyota Production System

136
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,000
can be found in any business textbook. Just-in-time manufacturing is no longer an innovation—it's the

137
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,200
norm. Articles aren't written about companies implementing just-in-time—they're written about

138
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,560
those that don't. In fact, just-in-time has become even more integral today. If there are six steps

139
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,080
in the manufacturing process and each holds two months of inventory, it would take a year to pivot

140
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:21,840
to producing a new product. The short product life cycles of today's technology industry

141
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,440
would not accept that. Just-in-time is such a simple principle, but the pursuit of the

142
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:36,160
elimination of waste is now the central mission of any major manufacturer. However, most did it

143
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,480
wrong. Manufacturers globally saw the headline—elimination of inventory leads to massive efficiency

144
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,960
gains—and jumped on that without actually determining what made it work for Toyota.

145
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,160
They ignored that Japan's small physical size made for short domestic supply chains less vulnerable

146
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,800
to things going wrong. They ignored the company's production leveling—finding the average daily

147
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,840
demand and producing that, regardless of short-term changes in demand. They ignored the fact that

148
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,960
eliminating excess inventory is different from eliminating all inventory. They ignored the

149
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,320
principle of growing strong teams of cross-functional workers,

150
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,600
predicated on respecting people. They ignored the culture of stopping and fixing problems,

151
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,200
to get things right the first time. They ignored huge swaths of the Toyota way, and created a

152
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,960
system that's less effective and less resilient, but can impress shareholders through short-term

153
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:33,920
savings. How Toyota has effectively implemented this system fills books, but many are just reading

154
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:42,320
the covers. Even Toyota, though, is not perfect. In 2011, Japan was rocked by a 9.0 magnitude

155
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,400
earthquake—the fourth strongest ever recorded anywhere. Not only did this cause immense

156
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,240
destruction to life and property, but it also led Toyota to recognize a flaw in its own system.

157
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,640
As Japan recovered, some supply chains were quick to as well—for example, securing plastic resin

158
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,160
for door panel production is not difficult. There are plenty of manufacturers globally creating

159
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:13,920
easily substitutable alternatives. That's not the case with, say, semiconductors. The hugely

160
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,360
expensive facilities that create these chips require years to construct, and after the 2011

161
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,680
earthquake, it took many months to mend them back to operating status. This surfaced a truth that

162
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,800
had never been fully considered. Not all supply chains are made equal. Plastic resin can handle

163
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,000
supply chain disruption. Semiconductors cannot. Therefore, Toyota made changes.

164
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,040
All along, their mission was not to eliminate inventory full stop—it was to eliminate excess

165
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,200
inventory. Supply chain disruption is inevitable. It's inevitable in the same way that Titanic's

166
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,640
flawed design would eventually encounter an iceberg, or the structural economic

167
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,400
vulnerabilities of 2008 would eventually collide with a market panic. Therefore, semiconductor

168
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,680
inventory is not excess because, inevitably, due to the inevitability of disruption,

169
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,280
excess semiconductor inventory will eventually become necessary. Recognizing this, Toyota,

170
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,320
in recent years, has started to build up a stockpile of two to six months' worth of chips,

171
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
and that's why the company is the only major vehicle manufacturer that is unfazed by the

172
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:32,240
semiconductor shortage. Toyota followed its own principles—it did not stray from them,

173
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,680
and it did not reinvent them. It's no surprise that Toyota excels at implementing its own system,

174
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,120
but it is a surprise that the entire manufacturing world has so wholeheartedly embraced flawed

175
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:49,280
implementation of the system. The reality is that just-in-time manufacturing is more efficient,

176
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,120
but some think that that efficiency must come with a trade-off in resilience. That's simply

177
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,120
not true. Proper just-in-time supply chains must inherently be inflexible once formed,

178
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,480
but their form is flexible. It's a philosophy, not an equation. Shortages in an economy are

179
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,280
incredibly complex, and any explanation of them is an oversimplification, but just-in-time

180
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,640
manufacturing does not have to be the cause. In addition, disruption is inevitable, so it can't

181
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,600
be the cause. You can't blame the fact that your house is sinking on the fact that you built it

182
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,160
in the ocean. A ruthless pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of long-term gain is the

183
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,000
cause. Running as close as possible to the edge is the most efficient manner to manufacture…

184
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,840
until it isn't. Constructing a resilient supply chain requires long-term thinking,

185
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,920
but most companies have not nurtured an environment that allows for that.

186
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,840
As the world recovers from the pandemic, many will ditch what they call just-in-time manufacturing,

187
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,920
as the alternative is to accept that the very people in charge of those companies

188
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,560
haven't implemented it properly. To be fair, few have, and even Toyota is still learning how to

189
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:10,800
best implement its own system. However, Toyota has proven that strict adherence to its principles

190
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:17,040
means just-in-time manufacturing can be everything at once—it can be both efficient and resilient,

191
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,800
if one knows what is truly excess. Proper implementation of the Toyota system

192
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,560
won't fix every shortage, but it did fix one shortage for one company. Therefore,

193
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,480
if the auto industry had built a stockpile of critical components, if it had implemented

194
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,880
production leveling more strictly, and if it had understood vulnerabilities in inbound supply

195
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,920
chains, Alaska would have its rental cars. Unlike the world of physical goods, it's

196
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,960
impossible to manufacture new website domains. Once one is gone, it's gone for good. Therefore,

197
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,600
that's why, whenever I have a new idea for a YouTube channel, a podcast, or anything,

198
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,760
my first step is to buy the domain on Hover. Their transparent, straightforward, and fair pricing

199
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,080
means that I know I'm getting a good deal, and it's pretty important to have your domain secured

200
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,640
if whatever you're doing has a chance of growing. If I didn't get the WendoverProductions.com

201
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,920
domain, I'm sure someone would have snatched it up as soon as the channel grew. I use that not only

202
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,360
for the website itself, but also for email. Hover lets you set up a custom email address at a custom

203
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,520
domain in quite literally seconds, and now when I send emails to someone I want to interview,

204
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,280
for example, they see that it's from a professional-looking address, rather than one

205
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,480
ending in Gmail, Yahoo, or iCloud, and I have a better chance of success. To grab your domain

206
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,120
before it's gone, and set up a professional custom email address, all for 10% off, head

207
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,320
to Hover.com slash Wendover, and you'll be helping support the channel while you're at it.
