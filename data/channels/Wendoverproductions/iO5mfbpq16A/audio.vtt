This video was made possible by Morning Brew—subscribe to their free daily newsletter at the link

00:05.800 --> 00:11.200
in the description to make a daily habit of learning what's going on in the world.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.440
This is a map of the world, these are its countries, this is their GDP per capita, and

00:16.440 --> 00:17.960
that's the equator.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.320
With a mere glance, a pattern emerges.

00:21.320 --> 00:27.560
This half of the world, the southern hemisphere, is poorer than this half, the northern hemisphere.

00:27.560 --> 00:33.080
Of course, GDP is an imperfect indicator, but even when you swap to another, like the

00:33.080 --> 00:37.740
United Nations' Human Development Index, the pattern holds.

00:37.740 --> 00:42.720
The southern hemisphere is, on average, less developed than the north.

00:42.720 --> 00:48.680
In fact, of the 58 countries the World Bank classifies as high-income, a mere five—Chile,

00:48.680 --> 00:54.940
Uruguay, the Seychelles, Australia, and New Zealand—are located south of the equator.

00:54.940 --> 00:59.460
If you look at the entire global distribution of wealth and average it to find the center,

00:59.460 --> 01:05.220
the world's economic center of gravity, that point is located here, northeast of Moscow,

01:05.220 --> 01:08.820
at roughly the same latitude as Stockholm.

01:08.820 --> 01:14.860
That center of wealth is pulled to this point by the world's three main economic centers—southeast

01:14.860 --> 01:18.600
Asia, western Europe, and North America.

01:18.600 --> 01:23.500
The southern hemisphere, representing just 11% of the world's population, has little

01:23.500 --> 01:29.260
economic sway, meager political influence, and has never, in modern history, enjoyed

01:29.260 --> 01:33.340
a similar level of development to its northern counterpart.

01:33.340 --> 01:36.340
So… why?

01:36.340 --> 01:38.860
The quick answer is we don't know.

01:38.860 --> 01:44.920
As any phenomenon grows in size, an accurate explanation grows increasingly difficult.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.740
This phenomenon spans the entirety of the world's geography, the entirety of modern

01:49.740 --> 01:53.460
history, and the entirety of the global economy.

01:53.460 --> 01:57.720
Therefore, any explanation is mere theory.

01:57.720 --> 02:03.580
Theories are not fact, but rather represent a strong consensus in academic thinking.

02:03.580 --> 02:10.060
That being said, through time, theories can be proved flawed, limited, or flat-out false.

02:10.060 --> 02:15.140
In fact, in the past hundred years, the ways in which we think about how geography correlates

02:15.140 --> 02:18.700
to wealth has changed fundamentally.

02:18.700 --> 02:24.620
Take, for example, this—the opening lines of the 1915 book Civilization and Climate

02:24.620 --> 02:26.340
by Ellsworth Huntington.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.980
Quote, the races of the earth are like trees.

02:29.980 --> 02:34.200
Each according to its kind brings forth the fruit known as civilization.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.400
As russet apples and pippins may grow from the same trunk, and as peaches may be grafted

02:38.400 --> 02:44.420
on a plum tree, so the culture of applied races may be transferred from one to another.

02:44.420 --> 02:49.800
Yet no one expects pears on cherry branches, and it is useless to look for Slavic civilization

02:49.800 --> 02:51.200
among the Chinese.

02:51.200 --> 02:55.820
He goes on to liken the actions of humans to a grower cultivating their vineyard.

02:55.820 --> 03:00.680
This can enhance a crop, but what matters more is the geography of where the grapes

03:00.680 --> 03:01.820
grow.

03:01.820 --> 03:06.820
No matter how well cultivated, you never expect good grapes from Greenland.

03:06.820 --> 03:11.360
Huntington posits that the two key factors influencing the success of a vineyard are

03:11.360 --> 03:17.240
its environment, which is inherited, and its health, which is dependent on human action.

03:17.240 --> 03:22.720
Huntington then asks, quote, does the fruit known as civilization depend on these same

03:22.720 --> 03:24.160
conditions?

03:24.160 --> 03:26.960
It seems to me that it does.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.120
Few would question that a race with a superb mental and physical inheritance and endowed

03:31.120 --> 03:36.000
with perfect health is capable of adding indefinitely to the cultural inheritance received from

03:36.000 --> 03:39.720
its ancestors, and thus may attain the highest civilization.

03:39.720 --> 03:44.800
But if that same cultural inheritance were given to a sickly race with a weak inheritance

03:44.800 --> 03:49.960
of both mind and body, there would almost surely be degeneration.

03:49.960 --> 03:55.480
In short, Huntington argues that if one were to give good land to, in his words, a quote,

03:55.480 --> 04:00.120
sickly race, they would be incapable of properly developing it.

04:00.120 --> 04:04.360
Rhetoric like this is what was used to justify colonialism.

04:04.360 --> 04:08.520
Further core arguments of the book include theories positing that mental abilities correlate

04:08.520 --> 04:13.480
to average temperatures—the colder the climate, the smarter its people are.

04:13.480 --> 04:19.080
Therefore, in his logic, if you took people with higher mental abilities, from the cooler

04:19.080 --> 04:23.520
areas, and brought them to manage the hotter areas, they would be more successful, both

04:23.520 --> 04:27.280
literally and figuratively, in cultivating the land.

04:27.280 --> 04:29.360
This is false.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.160
This is also, unequivocally, racist.

04:32.160 --> 04:38.160
It's no surprise that later in his career, Huntington's research devolved into flat-out

04:38.160 --> 04:39.560
eugenics.

04:39.560 --> 04:44.440
We now know the belief that a hotter environment makes people quote-unquote uncivilized, as

04:44.440 --> 04:47.200
was once a prevailing view, is absurd.

04:47.200 --> 04:52.200
The temperature or physical environment of a place does not change a person in any meaningful

04:52.200 --> 04:53.200
way.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.360
The reason this southwest corner of Egypt, for example, is almost completely undeveloped

04:57.360 --> 05:01.440
is not because the sun is degrading its people's mental abilities.

05:01.440 --> 05:06.960
However, simultaneously, it would be absurd to believe that geography does not play a

05:06.960 --> 05:08.760
role in development.

05:08.760 --> 05:12.840
We know, with some certainty, that the reason this corner of Egypt is almost completely

05:12.840 --> 05:18.680
undeveloped is because it's in the Sahara Desert, with inhumane heat, little to no water,

05:18.680 --> 05:21.520
and few desirable natural resources.

05:21.520 --> 05:26.380
The thin line between racism and legitimate theory is what makes examining any correlation

05:26.380 --> 05:29.320
between geography and wealth so difficult.

05:29.320 --> 05:34.380
However, a simple rule can delineate the two.

05:34.380 --> 05:39.580
Geography does not influence a person's ability to develop a place.

05:39.580 --> 05:45.720
However, geography can influence a place's ability to be developed by people.

05:45.720 --> 05:50.980
A place's development potential is absolutely influenced by geography.

05:50.980 --> 05:57.460
Therefore, that poses a question—what does the northern hemisphere have that the southern

05:57.460 --> 05:58.880
does not?

05:58.880 --> 06:01.620
In short, latitude.

06:01.620 --> 06:06.100
Not only does the southern hemisphere have about half as much land as the northern, but

06:06.100 --> 06:09.500
that land does not stretch as far from the equator.

06:09.500 --> 06:14.900
For example, Cape Town, at the southern tip of Africa, sits about 34 degrees south of

06:14.900 --> 06:15.940
the equator.

06:15.940 --> 06:20.980
In the northern hemisphere, cities at an equivalent distance to the equator include Los Angeles

06:20.980 --> 06:25.460
or Baghdad—hardly what anyone would consider northern cities.

06:25.460 --> 06:29.280
So, what effect does this have?

06:29.280 --> 06:32.740
This is a graph composed of the world's countries.

06:32.740 --> 06:37.580
The higher a given country is, the wealthier it is on a per capita basis, while the further

06:37.580 --> 06:40.900
to the right it is, the further it sits from the equator.

06:40.900 --> 06:45.920
The pattern that emerges is decisive—the further a country is from the equator, the

06:45.920 --> 06:47.720
wealthier it is.

06:47.720 --> 06:52.380
Therefore, a plausible reason for why the southern hemisphere is poorer is simply that

06:52.380 --> 06:54.360
its landmass sits closer to the equator.

06:54.360 --> 07:00.320
But that's not a full explanation, because it then presents a new question—why are

07:00.320 --> 07:03.080
equatorial countries poorer?

07:03.080 --> 07:07.640
Bounded by the perspective of our lifetimes, it's easy to forget how close we are in

07:07.640 --> 07:11.140
history to an era dominated by agriculture.

07:11.140 --> 07:16.640
Just 100 years ago, when the world was the domain of many of our grandparents, 70% of

07:16.640 --> 07:20.400
Earth's working population was employed in agriculture.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.260
Today, that number is just 27%.

07:24.260 --> 07:30.240
As industry innovation and mechanization ramped up, so too did per-person productivity.

07:30.240 --> 07:36.200
However, 27% is an average of a highly variable data set.

07:36.200 --> 07:44.100
Today, 1.66% of the US's labor force is employed in agriculture—86% of the Central

07:44.100 --> 07:46.400
African Republic's is.

07:46.400 --> 07:52.400
This indicator represents one of the starkest differences between rich and poor countries.

07:52.400 --> 07:57.600
Places like the UK, France, Japan, and Australia sit at low single digits, while those like

07:57.600 --> 08:02.280
Mauritania, Madagascar, and Laos sit at high double digits.

08:02.280 --> 08:08.600
Unsurprisingly, comparing this map to that of GDP per capita, it tracks quite closely.

08:08.600 --> 08:13.480
Countries with low GDP have high agricultural employment percentages, and vice versa.

08:13.560 --> 08:19.120
So, does this mean poverty creates high agricultural employment rates, or that high agricultural

08:19.120 --> 08:21.500
employment rates create poverty?

08:21.500 --> 08:25.120
Or rather, is this correlation or causation?

08:25.120 --> 08:30.680
Well, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 60% of

08:30.680 --> 08:36.800
the calories humans consume are derived from just three crops—maize, or corn as it's

08:36.800 --> 08:39.480
known in the US, rice, and wheat.

08:39.480 --> 08:44.840
Now, in agriculture, as any farmer will tell you, climate is everything.

08:44.840 --> 08:49.840
In the case of wheat, the highest yield temperature—as in, the temperature that leads to the largest

08:49.840 --> 08:56.220
harvest of crop per unit of land—is about 74 degrees Fahrenheit, or 23 Celsius.

08:56.220 --> 09:01.420
Every degree Celsius above that, average wheat yields decrease by 10%.

09:01.420 --> 09:06.440
What this means is that more equatorial countries, which tend to be hotter, have less productive

09:06.440 --> 09:07.680
wheat crops.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.380
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations created this map to show the

09:12.380 --> 09:17.200
average possible wheat yield around the world, and unsurprisingly, it roughly correlates

09:17.200 --> 09:21.140
with the map of countries' agricultural labor force proportion.

09:21.140 --> 09:23.180
This makes sense.

09:23.180 --> 09:27.500
The less productive farmland is, the more people you need to produce a person's worth

09:27.500 --> 09:28.700
of food.

09:28.700 --> 09:33.640
The more people working to create food, the less there are to innovate and grow an economy.

09:33.640 --> 09:38.820
Therefore, this also correlates to the map of countries' GDP per capita, or human development

09:38.820 --> 09:40.180
index.

09:40.180 --> 09:45.960
While every crop is different, in terms of its ideal temperature, as a generalization,

09:45.960 --> 09:50.480
warm but not hot places are those best suited for agriculture.

09:50.480 --> 09:55.820
Those warm but not hot places are overwhelmingly located in the temperate zone of latitudes,

09:55.820 --> 09:59.240
which encompasses very little of the southern hemisphere's landmass.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.540
It's a similar story with disease.

10:02.540 --> 10:08.420
The burden of disease, while heavily skewed by equatorial Africa, is, on average, higher

10:08.420 --> 10:11.020
the closer to the equator a country is.

10:11.020 --> 10:15.980
Malaria, for example, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world.

10:15.980 --> 10:20.660
It's prevalent predominantly in areas that are hot year-round, have high humidity, and

10:20.660 --> 10:25.780
lots of rainfall which, overwhelmingly, represents equatorial regions.

10:25.780 --> 10:30.780
Beyond malaria, the lack of a cold season in equatorial regions means that insect populations

10:30.780 --> 10:35.780
run rampant, and mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and others are some of the most reliable disease

10:35.780 --> 10:37.420
vectors out there.

10:37.420 --> 10:43.420
Now, of course, in addition to insect-borne diseases, more common in equatorial areas,

10:43.420 --> 10:47.380
there are those that clearly are more common in poverty-stricken places.

10:47.380 --> 10:52.100
Diarrhea, for example, is a leading cause of death worldwide, and its root cause is

10:52.100 --> 10:57.460
often contaminated drinking water, which is more common in places with inadequate or nonexistent

10:57.460 --> 10:58.580
water infrastructure.

10:58.580 --> 11:04.460
Therefore, it's clear that poverty can spur disease, but less clear whether disease

11:04.460 --> 11:06.360
can spur poverty.

11:06.360 --> 11:10.460
This is a topic that has been debated in the world of international development for decades,

11:10.460 --> 11:16.580
but a loose consensus has formed that suggests the answer is yes—a higher burden of disease

11:16.580 --> 11:20.020
can negatively impact a national economy.

11:20.020 --> 11:23.460
Of course, this makes sense.

11:23.460 --> 11:27.440
Disease often means a person is unable to work, which means they are no longer able

11:27.440 --> 11:28.920
to expand an economy.

11:28.920 --> 11:33.800
So, it's clear that around the equator, poverty is increasing disease, and disease

11:33.800 --> 11:38.680
is increasing poverty, even if it's unclear the extent to which it's one versus the

11:38.680 --> 11:39.680
other.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.900
So, correlative factors such as agricultural yield, disease burden, and more certainly

11:44.900 --> 11:47.200
can cause a degree of poverty.

11:47.200 --> 11:52.200
However, it would be obtuse to think that the incredible level of inequality in the

11:52.200 --> 11:56.280
world—with the average Norwegian earning an average annual Somalian income in just

11:56.280 --> 12:02.140
three days—can be entirely explained by some heat, wheat, and bugs.

12:02.140 --> 12:07.140
More likely, these factors opened a gap that has been widened through time.

12:07.140 --> 12:13.240
In the US's National Hockey League, 31 teams competed in the 2020-2021 season, and their

12:13.240 --> 12:15.920
performance varied dramatically.

12:15.920 --> 12:21.040
At the upper end of that spectrum, the Washington Capitals did quite well, having won some 36

12:21.040 --> 12:26.520
teams, while the Columbus Blue Jackets did… less well, having won just 18.

12:26.520 --> 12:31.360
The Washington Capitals was established as a team in 1974, while the Blue Jackets was

12:31.360 --> 12:32.720
formed in 1997.

12:32.720 --> 12:37.480
So here's the question—is the reason the Capitals are better than the Blue Jackets

12:37.480 --> 12:40.000
because they've had more time to develop?

12:40.000 --> 12:44.360
That is, are the Blue Jackets fundamentally as good as the Capitals, but just 23 years

12:44.360 --> 12:49.140
behind in their development, or rather, are the Blue Jackets performing poorly because,

12:49.140 --> 12:53.440
in a sports league, by nature, some teams have to perform worse, and are pushed into

12:53.440 --> 12:57.740
that position by certain teams acquiring the best players, hiring the best coaches, and

12:57.740 --> 12:59.860
building the best facilities?

12:59.860 --> 13:04.160
Applying the same logic to countries, the former theory would suggest that the reason

13:04.160 --> 13:09.200
why Russia is less developed than the UK is because the UK experienced its Industrial

13:09.200 --> 13:16.940
Revolution from 1760 to 1820, while Russia waited until 1850 to 1920 to have its in earnest.

13:16.940 --> 13:22.100
Therefore, within a hundred year head start, the UK sits further along in the timeline

13:22.100 --> 13:23.100
of development.

13:23.100 --> 13:28.180
For the longest time, this was the explanation for inequality, and interventions involved

13:28.180 --> 13:32.980
attempting to speed up a country's progression in the supposed development timeline.

13:32.980 --> 13:37.340
Certain countries started their industrial development first, so now, in an era where

13:37.340 --> 13:43.220
industrialization is everything in an economy, certain countries have a leg up.

13:43.220 --> 13:46.060
That explanation eventually fell out of favor.

13:46.060 --> 13:51.060
It was once thought that after Africa decolonized, once any gains from industry would go to a

13:51.060 --> 13:55.700
country itself, rather than its colonizer, that these places would start their process

13:55.700 --> 13:56.700
of development.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.700
But then they didn't.

13:58.700 --> 14:04.300
Many African countries are still in as desperate a state as 50 years ago, and simply aren't

14:04.300 --> 14:06.020
developing at all.

14:06.020 --> 14:11.340
Therefore, updated explanations have emerged—explanations that would suggest that the reason certain

14:11.340 --> 14:15.940
countries are poor is not because of their place in time, but rather their place in the

14:15.940 --> 14:17.780
world economy.

14:17.780 --> 14:21.020
Imagine there are just two countries.

14:21.020 --> 14:26.540
One has a GDP per capita of $10,000, the other $20,000.

14:26.540 --> 14:31.220
The poorer country sells what we'll call primary goods—products that don't require

14:31.220 --> 14:34.460
manufacturing, like agriculture and raw materials.

14:34.460 --> 14:39.520
The second country, however, sells manufactured goods—they'll take a tree and turn it

14:39.520 --> 14:41.660
into a stool, for example.

14:41.660 --> 14:44.720
But now the richer country has invented ice cream.

14:44.720 --> 14:48.040
Of course, people don't need ice cream.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.200
People want ice cream, but they don't need it.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.840
Therefore, people only buy ice cream when they have the money to do so—as in, when

14:55.840 --> 14:57.180
they're wealthier.

14:57.180 --> 15:01.160
Because the wealthier country has now invented a way to turn cheaper raw materials into a

15:01.160 --> 15:04.000
more expensive product, they're now richer.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.360
They'll sell some of this within their own country, some to the poorer country, and also

15:08.360 --> 15:12.360
buy some raw materials to make the ice cream from the poorer country.

15:12.360 --> 15:16.500
Because the rich country is getting richer, more people are able to buy that ice cream,

15:16.500 --> 15:18.880
so demand goes up.

15:18.880 --> 15:24.980
As is economics 101, when demand for a product goes up, but supplies stay stable, so does

15:24.980 --> 15:26.240
the price.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.880
This cycle repeats itself—the rich country might invent bikes, then light bulbs, then

15:30.880 --> 15:35.120
eventually smartphones, and all the while, it's buying the materials to make these

15:35.120 --> 15:39.600
products from the poorer country—the one that sells primary goods.

15:39.600 --> 15:44.060
Meanwhile, demand for primary goods has stayed relatively stable.

15:44.060 --> 15:47.600
People buying manufactured goods aren't necessarily buying more things, but just more

15:47.600 --> 15:53.040
expensive things, so the raw materials industry is about stable, and with products like food,

15:53.040 --> 15:57.440
one person buys about one person's worth of food regardless of income.

15:57.440 --> 16:03.500
So, in summary, we know that demand for primary goods, like food and raw materials, stays

16:03.500 --> 16:07.080
relatively stable regardless of a person's income.

16:07.080 --> 16:12.300
Demand for manufactured goods, however, increases dramatically as one's income does.

16:12.300 --> 16:17.360
Therefore, through time, the primary goods country's economy stays relatively stable,

16:17.360 --> 16:20.420
while the manufactured goods country's economy grows.

16:20.420 --> 16:25.900
All the while, the prices for manufactured goods rise, as demand does, because the manufactured

16:25.900 --> 16:28.580
goods country's people are becoming wealthier.

16:28.580 --> 16:33.540
Therefore, people in the poorer country are increasingly less able to buy these manufactured

16:33.540 --> 16:37.400
goods, as their incomes have stayed relatively stable.

16:37.400 --> 16:41.660
This is what's theorized to be happening in the real world right now.

16:41.660 --> 16:46.100
We know that Papua New Guinea, for example, cannot make iPhones.

16:46.100 --> 16:50.740
Their industrial sector just is not equipped for the most advanced manufacturing.

16:50.740 --> 16:55.900
Therefore, their economy is more centered around primary goods—it's an extractive

16:55.900 --> 16:57.080
economy.

16:57.080 --> 17:01.760
Countries like Japan, however, have developed so much, and their wages have grown so much,

17:01.760 --> 17:06.360
that it rarely makes financial sense for them to produce primary goods rather than manufactured

17:06.360 --> 17:07.360
goods.

17:07.360 --> 17:12.960
Therefore, we can say that, in general, poorer countries produce primary goods, richer countries

17:12.960 --> 17:15.240
produce manufactured goods.

17:15.240 --> 17:20.120
The total cost of the raw materials in an iPhone, for example, as in the materials before

17:20.120 --> 17:24.740
any manufacturing process, is just a few dollars.

17:24.740 --> 17:30.860
Through advanced manufacturing, that is transformed into something that sells for more than $1,000.

17:30.860 --> 17:36.060
Therefore, with this theory, it's believed that poorer, primary goods-producing countries

17:36.060 --> 17:42.740
are serving a crucial role in the world economy, but not one that creates significant profit.

17:42.740 --> 17:47.340
As a result, they have no money to invest in advancing their economy, and are stuck

17:47.340 --> 17:49.680
producing primary goods.

17:49.680 --> 17:53.700
While this theory has lost some relevance as outsourcing has become more common, it's

17:53.700 --> 17:57.640
still the case that the countries profiting from advanced manufacturing are overwhelmingly

17:57.640 --> 18:03.800
located in rich countries, even if manufacturing itself has moved somewhat to poorer countries.

18:03.800 --> 18:09.140
This is only a part of a complex and still controversial theory, but at the crux of it

18:09.140 --> 18:13.980
is a simple belief— poorer countries are dependent.

18:13.980 --> 18:19.060
They create resources, and these resources flow to richer countries, who reap the majority

18:19.060 --> 18:20.540
of their gains.

18:20.540 --> 18:25.240
While this was very much the case during the era of colonialism, countries exited this

18:25.240 --> 18:28.620
era with largely the same economic system.

18:28.620 --> 18:33.060
Therefore, they were stuck making primary goods, where they're unable to accumulate

18:33.060 --> 18:36.260
significant capital and advance their economy.

18:36.260 --> 18:41.660
At the crux of it, according to this theory, poorer countries get poorer and rich countries

18:41.660 --> 18:43.000
get richer.

18:43.000 --> 18:47.180
The countries closer to the equator, and those that disproportionately make up the southern

18:47.180 --> 18:52.820
hemisphere, do have natural factors that legitimately negatively impact their ability

18:52.820 --> 18:54.820
to develop economically.

18:54.820 --> 18:59.860
These factors very possibly were the origin of the development gap between, for example,

18:59.860 --> 19:01.460
Europe and Africa.

19:01.460 --> 19:08.060
However, there is an increasing, albeit controversial, consensus around the thought that our modern,

19:08.060 --> 19:13.700
global economic system might be working to widen the gap between rich and poor—nobody's

19:13.700 --> 19:16.260
becoming a billionaire by running a farm.

19:16.340 --> 19:19.420
They're becoming a billionaire selling iPhones.

19:19.420 --> 19:24.800
Therefore, as some countries are stuck selling food, minerals, and other raw materials to

19:24.800 --> 19:32.300
those that transform them into profit, their cycle of poverty is bound to continue.

19:32.300 --> 19:36.820
This video, like many of mine, strives to explain how the world works, and one of the

19:36.820 --> 19:41.340
best ways to understand how the world works is by following what's happening in it.

19:41.340 --> 19:45.760
That's why I subscribe to the free Morning Brew newsletter.

19:45.760 --> 19:49.960
This way, each morning, I can catch up on what's happening in business, finance, and

19:49.960 --> 19:52.960
tech in just about five minutes.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.640
Unlike most traditional news sources, Morning Brew is quick, witty, relevant, and informative

19:57.640 --> 20:01.920
all at once, so I always find it a great way to start my day.

20:01.920 --> 20:06.240
For example, this morning, I was reading up on how the pandemic-induced recession technically

20:06.240 --> 20:11.480
lasted just two months, why Volkswagen is discontinuing its Passat model in the US,

20:11.480 --> 20:14.000
and what major IPOs are upcoming.

20:14.080 --> 20:18.720
Morning Brew is entirely free, so it's worth trying out, and if it turns out you're not

20:18.720 --> 20:21.600
a fan, you won't have lost a thing.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.960
So, head to the link in the description and see why Morning Brew is quite literally step

20:25.960 --> 20:27.800
one in my day.
