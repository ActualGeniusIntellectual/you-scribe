11200	16440	This is a map of the world, these are its countries, this is their GDP per capita, and
16440	17960	that's the equator.
17960	21320	With a mere glance, a pattern emerges.
21320	27560	This half of the world, the southern hemisphere, is poorer than this half, the northern hemisphere.
27560	33080	Of course, GDP is an imperfect indicator, but even when you swap to another, like the
33080	37740	United Nations' Human Development Index, the pattern holds.
37740	42720	The southern hemisphere is, on average, less developed than the north.
42720	48680	In fact, of the 58 countries the World Bank classifies as high-income, a mere five—Chile,
48680	54940	Uruguay, the Seychelles, Australia, and New Zealand—are located south of the equator.
54940	59460	If you look at the entire global distribution of wealth and average it to find the center,
59460	65220	the world's economic center of gravity, that point is located here, northeast of Moscow,
65220	68820	at roughly the same latitude as Stockholm.
68820	74860	That center of wealth is pulled to this point by the world's three main economic centers—southeast
74860	78600	Asia, western Europe, and North America.
78600	83500	The southern hemisphere, representing just 11% of the world's population, has little
83500	89260	economic sway, meager political influence, and has never, in modern history, enjoyed
89260	93340	a similar level of development to its northern counterpart.
93340	96340	So… why?
96340	98860	The quick answer is we don't know.
98860	104920	As any phenomenon grows in size, an accurate explanation grows increasingly difficult.
104920	109740	This phenomenon spans the entirety of the world's geography, the entirety of modern
109740	113460	history, and the entirety of the global economy.
113460	117720	Therefore, any explanation is mere theory.
117720	123580	Theories are not fact, but rather represent a strong consensus in academic thinking.
123580	130060	That being said, through time, theories can be proved flawed, limited, or flat-out false.
130060	135140	In fact, in the past hundred years, the ways in which we think about how geography correlates
135140	138700	to wealth has changed fundamentally.
138700	144620	Take, for example, this—the opening lines of the 1915 book Civilization and Climate
144620	146340	by Ellsworth Huntington.
146340	149980	Quote, the races of the earth are like trees.
149980	154200	Each according to its kind brings forth the fruit known as civilization.
154200	158400	As russet apples and pippins may grow from the same trunk, and as peaches may be grafted
158400	164420	on a plum tree, so the culture of applied races may be transferred from one to another.
164420	169800	Yet no one expects pears on cherry branches, and it is useless to look for Slavic civilization
169800	171200	among the Chinese.
171200	175820	He goes on to liken the actions of humans to a grower cultivating their vineyard.
175820	180680	This can enhance a crop, but what matters more is the geography of where the grapes
180680	181820	grow.
181820	186820	No matter how well cultivated, you never expect good grapes from Greenland.
186820	191360	Huntington posits that the two key factors influencing the success of a vineyard are
191360	197240	its environment, which is inherited, and its health, which is dependent on human action.
197240	202720	Huntington then asks, quote, does the fruit known as civilization depend on these same
202720	204160	conditions?
204160	206960	It seems to me that it does.
206960	211120	Few would question that a race with a superb mental and physical inheritance and endowed
211120	216000	with perfect health is capable of adding indefinitely to the cultural inheritance received from
216000	219720	its ancestors, and thus may attain the highest civilization.
219720	224800	But if that same cultural inheritance were given to a sickly race with a weak inheritance
224800	229960	of both mind and body, there would almost surely be degeneration.
229960	235480	In short, Huntington argues that if one were to give good land to, in his words, a quote,
235480	240120	sickly race, they would be incapable of properly developing it.
240120	244360	Rhetoric like this is what was used to justify colonialism.
244360	248520	Further core arguments of the book include theories positing that mental abilities correlate
248520	253480	to average temperatures—the colder the climate, the smarter its people are.
253480	259080	Therefore, in his logic, if you took people with higher mental abilities, from the cooler
259080	263520	areas, and brought them to manage the hotter areas, they would be more successful, both
263520	267280	literally and figuratively, in cultivating the land.
267280	269360	This is false.
269360	272160	This is also, unequivocally, racist.
272160	278160	It's no surprise that later in his career, Huntington's research devolved into flat-out
278160	279560	eugenics.
279560	284440	We now know the belief that a hotter environment makes people quote-unquote uncivilized, as
284440	287200	was once a prevailing view, is absurd.
287200	292200	The temperature or physical environment of a place does not change a person in any meaningful
292200	293200	way.
293200	297360	The reason this southwest corner of Egypt, for example, is almost completely undeveloped
297360	301440	is not because the sun is degrading its people's mental abilities.
301440	306960	However, simultaneously, it would be absurd to believe that geography does not play a
306960	308760	role in development.
308760	312840	We know, with some certainty, that the reason this corner of Egypt is almost completely
312840	318680	undeveloped is because it's in the Sahara Desert, with inhumane heat, little to no water,
318680	321520	and few desirable natural resources.
321520	326380	The thin line between racism and legitimate theory is what makes examining any correlation
326380	329320	between geography and wealth so difficult.
329320	334380	However, a simple rule can delineate the two.
334380	339580	Geography does not influence a person's ability to develop a place.
339580	345720	However, geography can influence a place's ability to be developed by people.
345720	350980	A place's development potential is absolutely influenced by geography.
350980	357460	Therefore, that poses a question—what does the northern hemisphere have that the southern
357460	358880	does not?
358880	361620	In short, latitude.
361620	366100	Not only does the southern hemisphere have about half as much land as the northern, but
366100	369500	that land does not stretch as far from the equator.
369500	374900	For example, Cape Town, at the southern tip of Africa, sits about 34 degrees south of
374900	375940	the equator.
375940	380980	In the northern hemisphere, cities at an equivalent distance to the equator include Los Angeles
380980	385460	or Baghdad—hardly what anyone would consider northern cities.
385460	389280	So, what effect does this have?
389280	392740	This is a graph composed of the world's countries.
392740	397580	The higher a given country is, the wealthier it is on a per capita basis, while the further
397580	400900	to the right it is, the further it sits from the equator.
400900	405920	The pattern that emerges is decisive—the further a country is from the equator, the
405920	407720	wealthier it is.
407720	412380	Therefore, a plausible reason for why the southern hemisphere is poorer is simply that
412380	414360	its landmass sits closer to the equator.
414360	420320	But that's not a full explanation, because it then presents a new question—why are
420320	423080	equatorial countries poorer?
423080	427640	Bounded by the perspective of our lifetimes, it's easy to forget how close we are in
427640	431140	history to an era dominated by agriculture.
431140	436640	Just 100 years ago, when the world was the domain of many of our grandparents, 70% of
436640	440400	Earth's working population was employed in agriculture.
440440	444260	Today, that number is just 27%.
444260	450240	As industry innovation and mechanization ramped up, so too did per-person productivity.
450240	456200	However, 27% is an average of a highly variable data set.
456200	464100	Today, 1.66% of the US's labor force is employed in agriculture—86% of the Central
464100	466400	African Republic's is.
466400	472400	This indicator represents one of the starkest differences between rich and poor countries.
472400	477600	Places like the UK, France, Japan, and Australia sit at low single digits, while those like
477600	482280	Mauritania, Madagascar, and Laos sit at high double digits.
482280	488600	Unsurprisingly, comparing this map to that of GDP per capita, it tracks quite closely.
488600	493480	Countries with low GDP have high agricultural employment percentages, and vice versa.
493560	499120	So, does this mean poverty creates high agricultural employment rates, or that high agricultural
499120	501500	employment rates create poverty?
501500	505120	Or rather, is this correlation or causation?
505120	510680	Well, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 60% of
510680	516800	the calories humans consume are derived from just three crops—maize, or corn as it's
516800	519480	known in the US, rice, and wheat.
519480	524840	Now, in agriculture, as any farmer will tell you, climate is everything.
524840	529840	In the case of wheat, the highest yield temperature—as in, the temperature that leads to the largest
529840	536220	harvest of crop per unit of land—is about 74 degrees Fahrenheit, or 23 Celsius.
536220	541420	Every degree Celsius above that, average wheat yields decrease by 10%.
541420	546440	What this means is that more equatorial countries, which tend to be hotter, have less productive
546440	547680	wheat crops.
547680	552380	The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations created this map to show the
552380	557200	average possible wheat yield around the world, and unsurprisingly, it roughly correlates
557200	561140	with the map of countries' agricultural labor force proportion.
561140	563180	This makes sense.
563180	567500	The less productive farmland is, the more people you need to produce a person's worth
567500	568700	of food.
568700	573640	The more people working to create food, the less there are to innovate and grow an economy.
573640	578820	Therefore, this also correlates to the map of countries' GDP per capita, or human development
578820	580180	index.
580180	585960	While every crop is different, in terms of its ideal temperature, as a generalization,
585960	590480	warm but not hot places are those best suited for agriculture.
590480	595820	Those warm but not hot places are overwhelmingly located in the temperate zone of latitudes,
595820	599240	which encompasses very little of the southern hemisphere's landmass.
599240	602540	It's a similar story with disease.
602540	608420	The burden of disease, while heavily skewed by equatorial Africa, is, on average, higher
608420	611020	the closer to the equator a country is.
611020	615980	Malaria, for example, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world.
615980	620660	It's prevalent predominantly in areas that are hot year-round, have high humidity, and
620660	625780	lots of rainfall which, overwhelmingly, represents equatorial regions.
625780	630780	Beyond malaria, the lack of a cold season in equatorial regions means that insect populations
630780	635780	run rampant, and mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and others are some of the most reliable disease
635780	637420	vectors out there.
637420	643420	Now, of course, in addition to insect-borne diseases, more common in equatorial areas,
643420	647380	there are those that clearly are more common in poverty-stricken places.
647380	652100	Diarrhea, for example, is a leading cause of death worldwide, and its root cause is
652100	657460	often contaminated drinking water, which is more common in places with inadequate or nonexistent
657460	658580	water infrastructure.
658580	664460	Therefore, it's clear that poverty can spur disease, but less clear whether disease
664460	666360	can spur poverty.
666360	670460	This is a topic that has been debated in the world of international development for decades,
670460	676580	but a loose consensus has formed that suggests the answer is yes—a higher burden of disease
676580	680020	can negatively impact a national economy.
680020	683460	Of course, this makes sense.
683460	687440	Disease often means a person is unable to work, which means they are no longer able
687440	688920	to expand an economy.
688920	693800	So, it's clear that around the equator, poverty is increasing disease, and disease
693800	698680	is increasing poverty, even if it's unclear the extent to which it's one versus the
698680	699680	other.
699680	704900	So, correlative factors such as agricultural yield, disease burden, and more certainly
704900	707200	can cause a degree of poverty.
707200	712200	However, it would be obtuse to think that the incredible level of inequality in the
712200	716280	world—with the average Norwegian earning an average annual Somalian income in just
716280	722140	three days—can be entirely explained by some heat, wheat, and bugs.
722140	727140	More likely, these factors opened a gap that has been widened through time.
727140	733240	In the US's National Hockey League, 31 teams competed in the 2020-2021 season, and their
733240	735920	performance varied dramatically.
735920	741040	At the upper end of that spectrum, the Washington Capitals did quite well, having won some 36
741040	746520	teams, while the Columbus Blue Jackets did… less well, having won just 18.
746520	751360	The Washington Capitals was established as a team in 1974, while the Blue Jackets was
751360	752720	formed in 1997.
752720	757480	So here's the question—is the reason the Capitals are better than the Blue Jackets
757480	760000	because they've had more time to develop?
760000	764360	That is, are the Blue Jackets fundamentally as good as the Capitals, but just 23 years
764360	769140	behind in their development, or rather, are the Blue Jackets performing poorly because,
769140	773440	in a sports league, by nature, some teams have to perform worse, and are pushed into
773440	777740	that position by certain teams acquiring the best players, hiring the best coaches, and
777740	779860	building the best facilities?
779860	784160	Applying the same logic to countries, the former theory would suggest that the reason
784160	789200	why Russia is less developed than the UK is because the UK experienced its Industrial
789200	796940	Revolution from 1760 to 1820, while Russia waited until 1850 to 1920 to have its in earnest.
796940	802100	Therefore, within a hundred year head start, the UK sits further along in the timeline
802100	803100	of development.
803100	808180	For the longest time, this was the explanation for inequality, and interventions involved
808180	812980	attempting to speed up a country's progression in the supposed development timeline.
812980	817340	Certain countries started their industrial development first, so now, in an era where
817340	823220	industrialization is everything in an economy, certain countries have a leg up.
823220	826060	That explanation eventually fell out of favor.
826060	831060	It was once thought that after Africa decolonized, once any gains from industry would go to a
831060	835700	country itself, rather than its colonizer, that these places would start their process
835700	836700	of development.
836700	838700	But then they didn't.
838700	844300	Many African countries are still in as desperate a state as 50 years ago, and simply aren't
844300	846020	developing at all.
846020	851340	Therefore, updated explanations have emerged—explanations that would suggest that the reason certain
851340	855940	countries are poor is not because of their place in time, but rather their place in the
855940	857780	world economy.
857780	861020	Imagine there are just two countries.
861020	866540	One has a GDP per capita of $10,000, the other $20,000.
866540	871220	The poorer country sells what we'll call primary goods—products that don't require
871220	874460	manufacturing, like agriculture and raw materials.
874460	879520	The second country, however, sells manufactured goods—they'll take a tree and turn it
879520	881660	into a stool, for example.
881660	884720	But now the richer country has invented ice cream.
884720	888040	Of course, people don't need ice cream.
888040	891200	People want ice cream, but they don't need it.
891200	895840	Therefore, people only buy ice cream when they have the money to do so—as in, when
895840	897180	they're wealthier.
897180	901160	Because the wealthier country has now invented a way to turn cheaper raw materials into a
901160	904000	more expensive product, they're now richer.
904000	908360	They'll sell some of this within their own country, some to the poorer country, and also
908360	912360	buy some raw materials to make the ice cream from the poorer country.
912360	916500	Because the rich country is getting richer, more people are able to buy that ice cream,
916500	918880	so demand goes up.
918880	924980	As is economics 101, when demand for a product goes up, but supplies stay stable, so does
924980	926240	the price.
926240	930880	This cycle repeats itself—the rich country might invent bikes, then light bulbs, then
930880	935120	eventually smartphones, and all the while, it's buying the materials to make these
935120	939600	products from the poorer country—the one that sells primary goods.
939600	944060	Meanwhile, demand for primary goods has stayed relatively stable.
944060	947600	People buying manufactured goods aren't necessarily buying more things, but just more
947600	953040	expensive things, so the raw materials industry is about stable, and with products like food,
953040	957440	one person buys about one person's worth of food regardless of income.
957440	963500	So, in summary, we know that demand for primary goods, like food and raw materials, stays
963500	967080	relatively stable regardless of a person's income.
967080	972300	Demand for manufactured goods, however, increases dramatically as one's income does.
972300	977360	Therefore, through time, the primary goods country's economy stays relatively stable,
977360	980420	while the manufactured goods country's economy grows.
980420	985900	All the while, the prices for manufactured goods rise, as demand does, because the manufactured
985900	988580	goods country's people are becoming wealthier.
988580	993540	Therefore, people in the poorer country are increasingly less able to buy these manufactured
993540	997400	goods, as their incomes have stayed relatively stable.
997400	1001660	This is what's theorized to be happening in the real world right now.
1001660	1006100	We know that Papua New Guinea, for example, cannot make iPhones.
1006100	1010740	Their industrial sector just is not equipped for the most advanced manufacturing.
1010740	1015900	Therefore, their economy is more centered around primary goods—it's an extractive
1015900	1017080	economy.
1017080	1021760	Countries like Japan, however, have developed so much, and their wages have grown so much,
1021760	1026360	that it rarely makes financial sense for them to produce primary goods rather than manufactured
1026360	1027360	goods.
1027360	1032960	Therefore, we can say that, in general, poorer countries produce primary goods, richer countries
1032960	1035240	produce manufactured goods.
1035240	1040120	The total cost of the raw materials in an iPhone, for example, as in the materials before
1040120	1044740	any manufacturing process, is just a few dollars.
1044740	1050860	Through advanced manufacturing, that is transformed into something that sells for more than $1,000.
1050860	1056060	Therefore, with this theory, it's believed that poorer, primary goods-producing countries
1056060	1062740	are serving a crucial role in the world economy, but not one that creates significant profit.
1062740	1067340	As a result, they have no money to invest in advancing their economy, and are stuck
1067340	1069680	producing primary goods.
1069680	1073700	While this theory has lost some relevance as outsourcing has become more common, it's
1073700	1077640	still the case that the countries profiting from advanced manufacturing are overwhelmingly
1077640	1083800	located in rich countries, even if manufacturing itself has moved somewhat to poorer countries.
1083800	1089140	This is only a part of a complex and still controversial theory, but at the crux of it
1089140	1093980	is a simple belief— poorer countries are dependent.
1093980	1099060	They create resources, and these resources flow to richer countries, who reap the majority
1099060	1100540	of their gains.
1100540	1105240	While this was very much the case during the era of colonialism, countries exited this
1105240	1108620	era with largely the same economic system.
1108620	1113060	Therefore, they were stuck making primary goods, where they're unable to accumulate
1113060	1116260	significant capital and advance their economy.
1116260	1121660	At the crux of it, according to this theory, poorer countries get poorer and rich countries
1121660	1123000	get richer.
1123000	1127180	The countries closer to the equator, and those that disproportionately make up the southern
1127180	1132820	hemisphere, do have natural factors that legitimately negatively impact their ability
1132820	1134820	to develop economically.
1134820	1139860	These factors very possibly were the origin of the development gap between, for example,
1139860	1141460	Europe and Africa.
1141460	1148060	However, there is an increasing, albeit controversial, consensus around the thought that our modern,
1148060	1153700	global economic system might be working to widen the gap between rich and poor—nobody's
1153700	1156260	becoming a billionaire by running a farm.
1156340	1159420	They're becoming a billionaire selling iPhones.
1159420	1164800	Therefore, as some countries are stuck selling food, minerals, and other raw materials to
1164800	1172300	those that transform them into profit, their cycle of poverty is bound to continue.
1172300	1176820	This video, like many of mine, strives to explain how the world works, and one of the
1176820	1181340	best ways to understand how the world works is by following what's happening in it.
1181340	1185760	That's why I subscribe to the free Morning Brew newsletter.
1185760	1189960	This way, each morning, I can catch up on what's happening in business, finance, and
1189960	1192960	tech in just about five minutes.
1192960	1197640	Unlike most traditional news sources, Morning Brew is quick, witty, relevant, and informative
1197640	1201920	all at once, so I always find it a great way to start my day.
1201920	1206240	For example, this morning, I was reading up on how the pandemic-induced recession technically
1206240	1211480	lasted just two months, why Volkswagen is discontinuing its Passat model in the US,
1211480	1214000	and what major IPOs are upcoming.
1214080	1218720	Morning Brew is entirely free, so it's worth trying out, and if it turns out you're not
1218720	1221600	a fan, you won't have lost a thing.
1221600	1225960	So, head to the link in the description and see why Morning Brew is quite literally step
1225960	1227800	one in my day.
