in the description to make a daily habit of learning what's going on in the world.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,440
This is a map of the world, these are its countries, this is their GDP per capita, and

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,960
that's the equator.

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,320
With a mere glance, a pattern emerges.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,560
This half of the world, the southern hemisphere, is poorer than this half, the northern hemisphere.

7
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:33,080
Of course, GDP is an imperfect indicator, but even when you swap to another, like the

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:37,740
United Nations' Human Development Index, the pattern holds.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,720
The southern hemisphere is, on average, less developed than the north.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,680
In fact, of the 58 countries the World Bank classifies as high-income, a mere five—Chile,

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,940
Uruguay, the Seychelles, Australia, and New Zealand—are located south of the equator.

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,460
If you look at the entire global distribution of wealth and average it to find the center,

13
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,220
the world's economic center of gravity, that point is located here, northeast of Moscow,

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,820
at roughly the same latitude as Stockholm.

15
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,860
That center of wealth is pulled to this point by the world's three main economic centers—southeast

16
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,600
Asia, western Europe, and North America.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,500
The southern hemisphere, representing just 11% of the world's population, has little

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:29,260
economic sway, meager political influence, and has never, in modern history, enjoyed

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,340
a similar level of development to its northern counterpart.

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,340
So… why?

21
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,860
The quick answer is we don't know.

22
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,920
As any phenomenon grows in size, an accurate explanation grows increasingly difficult.

23
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,740
This phenomenon spans the entirety of the world's geography, the entirety of modern

24
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,460
history, and the entirety of the global economy.

25
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,720
Therefore, any explanation is mere theory.

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,580
Theories are not fact, but rather represent a strong consensus in academic thinking.

27
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:10,060
That being said, through time, theories can be proved flawed, limited, or flat-out false.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,140
In fact, in the past hundred years, the ways in which we think about how geography correlates

29
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,700
to wealth has changed fundamentally.

30
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,620
Take, for example, this—the opening lines of the 1915 book Civilization and Climate

31
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,340
by Ellsworth Huntington.

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,980
Quote, the races of the earth are like trees.

33
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,200
Each according to its kind brings forth the fruit known as civilization.

34
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,400
As russet apples and pippins may grow from the same trunk, and as peaches may be grafted

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,420
on a plum tree, so the culture of applied races may be transferred from one to another.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,800
Yet no one expects pears on cherry branches, and it is useless to look for Slavic civilization

37
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,200
among the Chinese.

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,820
He goes on to liken the actions of humans to a grower cultivating their vineyard.

39
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,680
This can enhance a crop, but what matters more is the geography of where the grapes

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,820
grow.

41
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,820
No matter how well cultivated, you never expect good grapes from Greenland.

42
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,360
Huntington posits that the two key factors influencing the success of a vineyard are

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,240
its environment, which is inherited, and its health, which is dependent on human action.

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,720
Huntington then asks, quote, does the fruit known as civilization depend on these same

45
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
conditions?

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
It seems to me that it does.

47
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,120
Few would question that a race with a superb mental and physical inheritance and endowed

48
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,000
with perfect health is capable of adding indefinitely to the cultural inheritance received from

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,720
its ancestors, and thus may attain the highest civilization.

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,800
But if that same cultural inheritance were given to a sickly race with a weak inheritance

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,960
of both mind and body, there would almost surely be degeneration.

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,480
In short, Huntington argues that if one were to give good land to, in his words, a quote,

53
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,120
sickly race, they would be incapable of properly developing it.

54
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,360
Rhetoric like this is what was used to justify colonialism.

55
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,520
Further core arguments of the book include theories positing that mental abilities correlate

56
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,480
to average temperatures—the colder the climate, the smarter its people are.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,080
Therefore, in his logic, if you took people with higher mental abilities, from the cooler

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,520
areas, and brought them to manage the hotter areas, they would be more successful, both

59
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,280
literally and figuratively, in cultivating the land.

60
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
This is false.

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,160
This is also, unequivocally, racist.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,160
It's no surprise that later in his career, Huntington's research devolved into flat-out

63
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,560
eugenics.

64
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,440
We now know the belief that a hotter environment makes people quote-unquote uncivilized, as

65
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,200
was once a prevailing view, is absurd.

66
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,200
The temperature or physical environment of a place does not change a person in any meaningful

67
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
way.

68
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,360
The reason this southwest corner of Egypt, for example, is almost completely undeveloped

69
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
is not because the sun is degrading its people's mental abilities.

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,960
However, simultaneously, it would be absurd to believe that geography does not play a

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,760
role in development.

72
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,840
We know, with some certainty, that the reason this corner of Egypt is almost completely

73
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,680
undeveloped is because it's in the Sahara Desert, with inhumane heat, little to no water,

74
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,520
and few desirable natural resources.

75
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,380
The thin line between racism and legitimate theory is what makes examining any correlation

76
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,320
between geography and wealth so difficult.

77
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,380
However, a simple rule can delineate the two.

78
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,580
Geography does not influence a person's ability to develop a place.

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,720
However, geography can influence a place's ability to be developed by people.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,980
A place's development potential is absolutely influenced by geography.

81
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,460
Therefore, that poses a question—what does the northern hemisphere have that the southern

82
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,880
does not?

83
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,620
In short, latitude.

84
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,100
Not only does the southern hemisphere have about half as much land as the northern, but

85
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,500
that land does not stretch as far from the equator.

86
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,900
For example, Cape Town, at the southern tip of Africa, sits about 34 degrees south of

87
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,940
the equator.

88
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,980
In the northern hemisphere, cities at an equivalent distance to the equator include Los Angeles

89
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,460
or Baghdad—hardly what anyone would consider northern cities.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,280
So, what effect does this have?

91
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,740
This is a graph composed of the world's countries.

92
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,580
The higher a given country is, the wealthier it is on a per capita basis, while the further

93
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,900
to the right it is, the further it sits from the equator.

94
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,920
The pattern that emerges is decisive—the further a country is from the equator, the

95
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,720
wealthier it is.

96
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,380
Therefore, a plausible reason for why the southern hemisphere is poorer is simply that

97
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,360
its landmass sits closer to the equator.

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,320
But that's not a full explanation, because it then presents a new question—why are

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,080
equatorial countries poorer?

100
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,640
Bounded by the perspective of our lifetimes, it's easy to forget how close we are in

101
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,140
history to an era dominated by agriculture.

102
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,640
Just 100 years ago, when the world was the domain of many of our grandparents, 70% of

103
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,400
Earth's working population was employed in agriculture.

104
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,260
Today, that number is just 27%.

105
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:30,240
As industry innovation and mechanization ramped up, so too did per-person productivity.

106
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,200
However, 27% is an average of a highly variable data set.

107
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:44,100
Today, 1.66% of the US's labor force is employed in agriculture—86% of the Central

108
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,400
African Republic's is.

109
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,400
This indicator represents one of the starkest differences between rich and poor countries.

110
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,600
Places like the UK, France, Japan, and Australia sit at low single digits, while those like

111
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,280
Mauritania, Madagascar, and Laos sit at high double digits.

112
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,600
Unsurprisingly, comparing this map to that of GDP per capita, it tracks quite closely.

113
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,480
Countries with low GDP have high agricultural employment percentages, and vice versa.

114
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,120
So, does this mean poverty creates high agricultural employment rates, or that high agricultural

115
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,500
employment rates create poverty?

116
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,120
Or rather, is this correlation or causation?

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,680
Well, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 60% of

118
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,800
the calories humans consume are derived from just three crops—maize, or corn as it's

119
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,480
known in the US, rice, and wheat.

120
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,840
Now, in agriculture, as any farmer will tell you, climate is everything.

121
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,840
In the case of wheat, the highest yield temperature—as in, the temperature that leads to the largest

122
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,220
harvest of crop per unit of land—is about 74 degrees Fahrenheit, or 23 Celsius.

123
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,420
Every degree Celsius above that, average wheat yields decrease by 10%.

124
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,440
What this means is that more equatorial countries, which tend to be hotter, have less productive

125
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,680
wheat crops.

126
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,380
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations created this map to show the

127
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,200
average possible wheat yield around the world, and unsurprisingly, it roughly correlates

128
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,140
with the map of countries' agricultural labor force proportion.

129
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,180
This makes sense.

130
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,500
The less productive farmland is, the more people you need to produce a person's worth

131
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,700
of food.

132
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,640
The more people working to create food, the less there are to innovate and grow an economy.

133
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,820
Therefore, this also correlates to the map of countries' GDP per capita, or human development

134
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,180
index.

135
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,960
While every crop is different, in terms of its ideal temperature, as a generalization,

136
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,480
warm but not hot places are those best suited for agriculture.

137
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,820
Those warm but not hot places are overwhelmingly located in the temperate zone of latitudes,

138
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,240
which encompasses very little of the southern hemisphere's landmass.

139
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,540
It's a similar story with disease.

140
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:08,420
The burden of disease, while heavily skewed by equatorial Africa, is, on average, higher

141
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,020
the closer to the equator a country is.

142
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,980
Malaria, for example, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases in the world.

143
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,660
It's prevalent predominantly in areas that are hot year-round, have high humidity, and

144
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,780
lots of rainfall which, overwhelmingly, represents equatorial regions.

145
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Beyond malaria, the lack of a cold season in equatorial regions means that insect populations

146
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,780
run rampant, and mosquitoes, ticks, fleas, and others are some of the most reliable disease

147
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,420
vectors out there.

148
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Now, of course, in addition to insect-borne diseases, more common in equatorial areas,

149
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,380
there are those that clearly are more common in poverty-stricken places.

150
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,100
Diarrhea, for example, is a leading cause of death worldwide, and its root cause is

151
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:57,460
often contaminated drinking water, which is more common in places with inadequate or nonexistent

152
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,580
water infrastructure.

153
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:04,460
Therefore, it's clear that poverty can spur disease, but less clear whether disease

154
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,360
can spur poverty.

155
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,460
This is a topic that has been debated in the world of international development for decades,

156
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:16,580
but a loose consensus has formed that suggests the answer is yes—a higher burden of disease

157
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,020
can negatively impact a national economy.

158
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,460
Of course, this makes sense.

159
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,440
Disease often means a person is unable to work, which means they are no longer able

160
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,920
to expand an economy.

161
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,800
So, it's clear that around the equator, poverty is increasing disease, and disease

162
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,680
is increasing poverty, even if it's unclear the extent to which it's one versus the

163
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
other.

164
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,900
So, correlative factors such as agricultural yield, disease burden, and more certainly

165
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,200
can cause a degree of poverty.

166
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,200
However, it would be obtuse to think that the incredible level of inequality in the

167
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,280
world—with the average Norwegian earning an average annual Somalian income in just

168
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:02,140
three days—can be entirely explained by some heat, wheat, and bugs.

169
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,140
More likely, these factors opened a gap that has been widened through time.

170
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,240
In the US's National Hockey League, 31 teams competed in the 2020-2021 season, and their

171
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,920
performance varied dramatically.

172
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,040
At the upper end of that spectrum, the Washington Capitals did quite well, having won some 36

173
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,520
teams, while the Columbus Blue Jackets did… less well, having won just 18.

174
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,360
The Washington Capitals was established as a team in 1974, while the Blue Jackets was

175
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
formed in 1997.

176
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,480
So here's the question—is the reason the Capitals are better than the Blue Jackets

177
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,000
because they've had more time to develop?

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,360
That is, are the Blue Jackets fundamentally as good as the Capitals, but just 23 years

179
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,140
behind in their development, or rather, are the Blue Jackets performing poorly because,

180
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:53,440
in a sports league, by nature, some teams have to perform worse, and are pushed into

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,740
that position by certain teams acquiring the best players, hiring the best coaches, and

182
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,860
building the best facilities?

183
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,160
Applying the same logic to countries, the former theory would suggest that the reason

184
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,200
why Russia is less developed than the UK is because the UK experienced its Industrial

185
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,940
Revolution from 1760 to 1820, while Russia waited until 1850 to 1920 to have its in earnest.

186
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,100
Therefore, within a hundred year head start, the UK sits further along in the timeline

187
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
of development.

188
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,180
For the longest time, this was the explanation for inequality, and interventions involved

189
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,980
attempting to speed up a country's progression in the supposed development timeline.

190
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,340
Certain countries started their industrial development first, so now, in an era where

191
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:43,220
industrialization is everything in an economy, certain countries have a leg up.

192
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,060
That explanation eventually fell out of favor.

193
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,060
It was once thought that after Africa decolonized, once any gains from industry would go to a

194
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,700
country itself, rather than its colonizer, that these places would start their process

195
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
of development.

196
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
But then they didn't.

197
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:04,300
Many African countries are still in as desperate a state as 50 years ago, and simply aren't

198
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,020
developing at all.

199
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,340
Therefore, updated explanations have emerged—explanations that would suggest that the reason certain

200
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,940
countries are poor is not because of their place in time, but rather their place in the

201
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,780
world economy.

202
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:21,020
Imagine there are just two countries.

203
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,540
One has a GDP per capita of $10,000, the other $20,000.

204
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:31,220
The poorer country sells what we'll call primary goods—products that don't require

205
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,460
manufacturing, like agriculture and raw materials.

206
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,520
The second country, however, sells manufactured goods—they'll take a tree and turn it

207
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,660
into a stool, for example.

208
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,720
But now the richer country has invented ice cream.

209
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,040
Of course, people don't need ice cream.

210
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,200
People want ice cream, but they don't need it.

211
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,840
Therefore, people only buy ice cream when they have the money to do so—as in, when

212
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,180
they're wealthier.

213
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,160
Because the wealthier country has now invented a way to turn cheaper raw materials into a

214
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,000
more expensive product, they're now richer.

215
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,360
They'll sell some of this within their own country, some to the poorer country, and also

216
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,360
buy some raw materials to make the ice cream from the poorer country.

217
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,500
Because the rich country is getting richer, more people are able to buy that ice cream,

218
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,880
so demand goes up.

219
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,980
As is economics 101, when demand for a product goes up, but supplies stay stable, so does

220
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,240
the price.

221
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,880
This cycle repeats itself—the rich country might invent bikes, then light bulbs, then

222
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,120
eventually smartphones, and all the while, it's buying the materials to make these

223
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,600
products from the poorer country—the one that sells primary goods.

224
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,060
Meanwhile, demand for primary goods has stayed relatively stable.

225
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,600
People buying manufactured goods aren't necessarily buying more things, but just more

226
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:53,040
expensive things, so the raw materials industry is about stable, and with products like food,

227
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,440
one person buys about one person's worth of food regardless of income.

228
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,500
So, in summary, we know that demand for primary goods, like food and raw materials, stays

229
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,080
relatively stable regardless of a person's income.

230
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,300
Demand for manufactured goods, however, increases dramatically as one's income does.

231
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:17,360
Therefore, through time, the primary goods country's economy stays relatively stable,

232
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,420
while the manufactured goods country's economy grows.

233
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,900
All the while, the prices for manufactured goods rise, as demand does, because the manufactured

234
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,580
goods country's people are becoming wealthier.

235
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:33,540
Therefore, people in the poorer country are increasingly less able to buy these manufactured

236
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,400
goods, as their incomes have stayed relatively stable.

237
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,660
This is what's theorized to be happening in the real world right now.

238
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:46,100
We know that Papua New Guinea, for example, cannot make iPhones.

239
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,740
Their industrial sector just is not equipped for the most advanced manufacturing.

240
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,900
Therefore, their economy is more centered around primary goods—it's an extractive

241
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,080
economy.

242
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,760
Countries like Japan, however, have developed so much, and their wages have grown so much,

243
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,360
that it rarely makes financial sense for them to produce primary goods rather than manufactured

244
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,360
goods.

245
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,960
Therefore, we can say that, in general, poorer countries produce primary goods, richer countries

246
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,240
produce manufactured goods.

247
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,120
The total cost of the raw materials in an iPhone, for example, as in the materials before

248
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,740
any manufacturing process, is just a few dollars.

249
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,860
Through advanced manufacturing, that is transformed into something that sells for more than $1,000.

250
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,060
Therefore, with this theory, it's believed that poorer, primary goods-producing countries

251
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:42,740
are serving a crucial role in the world economy, but not one that creates significant profit.

252
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,340
As a result, they have no money to invest in advancing their economy, and are stuck

253
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,680
producing primary goods.

254
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,700
While this theory has lost some relevance as outsourcing has become more common, it's

255
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,640
still the case that the countries profiting from advanced manufacturing are overwhelmingly

256
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,800
located in rich countries, even if manufacturing itself has moved somewhat to poorer countries.

257
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,140
This is only a part of a complex and still controversial theory, but at the crux of it

258
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,980
is a simple belief— poorer countries are dependent.

259
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,060
They create resources, and these resources flow to richer countries, who reap the majority

260
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,540
of their gains.

261
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:25,240
While this was very much the case during the era of colonialism, countries exited this

262
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,620
era with largely the same economic system.

263
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,060
Therefore, they were stuck making primary goods, where they're unable to accumulate

264
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,260
significant capital and advance their economy.

265
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,660
At the crux of it, according to this theory, poorer countries get poorer and rich countries

266
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,000
get richer.

267
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,180
The countries closer to the equator, and those that disproportionately make up the southern

268
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,820
hemisphere, do have natural factors that legitimately negatively impact their ability

269
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
to develop economically.

270
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,860
These factors very possibly were the origin of the development gap between, for example,

271
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,460
Europe and Africa.

272
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:08,060
However, there is an increasing, albeit controversial, consensus around the thought that our modern,

273
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,700
global economic system might be working to widen the gap between rich and poor—nobody's

274
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,260
becoming a billionaire by running a farm.

275
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,420
They're becoming a billionaire selling iPhones.

276
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,800
Therefore, as some countries are stuck selling food, minerals, and other raw materials to

277
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:32,300
those that transform them into profit, their cycle of poverty is bound to continue.

278
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,820
This video, like many of mine, strives to explain how the world works, and one of the

279
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,340
best ways to understand how the world works is by following what's happening in it.

280
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,760
That's why I subscribe to the free Morning Brew newsletter.

281
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,960
This way, each morning, I can catch up on what's happening in business, finance, and

282
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,960
tech in just about five minutes.

283
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,640
Unlike most traditional news sources, Morning Brew is quick, witty, relevant, and informative

284
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,920
all at once, so I always find it a great way to start my day.

285
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,240
For example, this morning, I was reading up on how the pandemic-induced recession technically

286
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,480
lasted just two months, why Volkswagen is discontinuing its Passat model in the US,

287
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,000
and what major IPOs are upcoming.

288
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,720
Morning Brew is entirely free, so it's worth trying out, and if it turns out you're not

289
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
a fan, you won't have lost a thing.

290
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,960
So, head to the link in the description and see why Morning Brew is quite literally step

291
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,800
one in my day.
