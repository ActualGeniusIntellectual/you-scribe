0	1040	Hi there.
1040	5480	Just before this video starts, I wanted to briefly explain what it is.
5480	10240	About a week ago, we launched our first new channel in two years—Extremities.
10240	15560	It's about why and how the world's most remote settlements exist, told with stunning
15560	19720	visuals and exclusive interviews from these places.
19720	21880	What you're about to watch is the first episode.
21880	27620	It's about Little Bay Islands, a town that, for complex reasons, ceased to exist after
27620	30500	December 31st, 2019.
30500	34200	At the end of this, I'm not going to ask you to go sign up for CuriosityStream or to
34200	35820	check out HelloFresh or anything.
35820	41100	I'm just going to ask you, if you enjoyed this, to go subscribe to the Extremities channel
41100	46340	and check out the two other videos there, because this is the only one that will ever
46340	49180	go up on Wendover Productions.
49180	53180	With that, please enjoy the video.
53180	62460	At 5 PM, on December 31st, 2019, the MV Hazel McIsaac pulled away from Little Bay Islands.
62460	68800	Onboard were the last few holdouts of those who had called the tiny island hamlet home.
68800	73140	This would be the final time that the town's regular ferry service pushed off from the
73140	79460	rustic collection of snow-dusted crimson, off-white, and beige saltbox homes.
79460	84140	As it exited the protected harbor, the permanent population of Little Bay Islands plummeted
84140	87740	from fifty-four to just two.
87740	92980	For those on board, and the two still standing on shore, the weight of the moment hung heavy
92980	94220	in the air.
94220	99120	Mike Parsons, who along with his wife Georgina decided to stay, said of the final days that
99120	103400	a, quote, palpable sadness had enveloped the islands.
103400	107340	Although an all but inevitable conclusion, leaving hurt.
107340	114780	This is nowhere, there's nothing else there, you know, but still the people got the love
114780	117260	of the land where they were born, I mean, you know this.
117260	122060	As the ferry cut through the low-hanging fog and faded away in the evening's dying light,
122060	127420	and as the 2010s faded from present to past, a tiny town on a couple tiny islands closed
127420	132180	a chapter of its story that had begun some 200 years prior.
132180	137180	What was once a boomtown gone bust was now all but a ghost town.
137180	142240	That day, electricity that had powered the H.L. Strong Academy, Aunt Edna's B&B, the
142240	147860	two churches, and the dozens of hardly-built homes wrapping around the harbor shut off.
147860	153120	Unopposed by streetlights and the hum of habitation, night and its accompanying quiet settled over
153120	157980	the town of two, and Little Bay Islands became the eighth remote community in Newfoundland
157980	162220	and Labrador this century to permanently relocate.
162220	165860	The abandonment of Little Bay Islands, and the reason this small settlement existed in
165860	171180	the first place, is enmeshed in the intertwined history, politics, and economics of the North
171180	176260	Atlantic—all of which, across centuries of European settlement, have revolved around
176260	179660	a rather nondescript fish.
179660	184500	By the 2010s, Little Bay Islands, a name left plural to acknowledge the community straddling
184500	189140	of both Little Bay and Mack Islands, was on its last leg.
189140	194700	At its height, more than 500 called this small but bustling town nestled between the lush
194700	197780	forest and rocky coast home.
197780	201140	What brought people to Little Bay Islands, and the coast of Newfoundland, had little
201140	206880	to do with what was on land, but rather what swam in the surrounding waters.
206880	211140	But the reason why settlers, predominantly from Europe, came to Newfoundland and Labrador
211140	217940	and populated the outports was because of the proximity to this lush resource of wild
217940	222420	fish, and that continues to be the case.
222420	227120	Starting with the Paleo-Eskimo peoples, arriving around 1000 BCE, then followed by the Little
227120	232060	Passage peoples 2,000 years later, indigenous hunter-gatherer societies were the first to
232060	235580	recognize the wealth of Newfoundland's teeming coasts.
235580	239720	Not long after the Little Passage peoples had arrived, though, these waters became a
239720	241780	bit busier.
241780	246360	Northern and Western Europeans were next to identify the region's oceanic potential,
246360	251940	and unlike contemporary explorers, they weren't there for god, but for cod.
251940	258620	Simply put, cod, in my time I grew up and previous to that, cod was king.
258620	263100	Cod's prominence—its centrality to life in Little Bay Islands and Newfoundland more
263100	270040	broadly—spans well beyond Wilfred's lifetime, going back not just generations, but centuries.
270040	274540	When Norse sailors landed on Newfoundland hundreds of years prior to Columbus's crossing,
274540	279860	they skirted from one cold, barren shore to the next with little more than the prevalent,
279860	283860	easy-to-catch, high-in-protein fish to fill their caloric needs.
283860	289020	For the Europeans that followed, cod didn't just represent a calorie-dense source of sustenance,
289020	292660	but a resource with which they could turn a profit.
292660	296700	Although British and Basque fishing ventures kept tight-lips about their favorite spots,
296700	301900	it's likely that enterprising vessels cut across the Atlantic alongside and even before
301900	305200	Columbus and John Cabot in the 1490s.
305200	309660	Once Cabot had come across Newfoundland, though, the secret was out, as the explorer exclaimed
309660	314340	that these faraway waters were so well-stocked that all one had to do was stick a basket
314340	317140	in the ocean and it fill with fish.
317140	322220	While the European explorers carried with them a penchant to exaggerate, Cabot's description
322220	326820	of fishing in the Northwest Atlantic maps rather accurately onto the disposition of
326820	328420	the Atlantic cod.
328420	333700	An omnivorous bottom-feeder, cod are both perpetually lethargic and ceaselessly hungry,
333700	338700	and as such, gladly take bait and don't put up much of a fight once on a line.
338700	342860	Properly treated, cod keeps, too.
342860	350380	And cod, one thing about cod, was all salt, put under salt back there then.
350380	353700	So I mean you could keep it for a long, long time, a year, two years, three years if you
353700	354700	want to.
354700	356700	I don't know how long you could if you really needed it.
356700	363820	But usually it was cut, split, and salted, and then taken back to England and Portugal
363820	365320	and Spain.
365440	369600	These that, as Catholic, were eager to find alternatives to warm-blooded meats during
369600	370600	Lent.
370600	375040	As the fish gained popularity across Europe, becoming a staple in markets in the 1500s,
375040	379320	and appearing in the pages of Cervantes' Don Quixote, Zola's The Belly of Paris,
379320	384320	and Dumas' Le Grand Dix-Jonaire de Cuisine, European settlements took root along the rocky
384320	387240	shores of the continent's northeastern coast.
387240	392920	These hardy, self-reliant coastal communities, now known as outports, drove the growth of
392920	396040	Newfoundland from the 1700s onwards.
396040	400760	Built on and around the water, Little Bay Islands, only accessible by boat, angling
400760	404720	out to the rich waters of the Notre Dame Bay and the Grand Banks beyond, but hugging the
404720	410360	fragmented and protective coast of Newfoundland, was the quintessential outport.
410360	415480	The earliest census of Little Bay Islands dates to 1825, but some locals like Wilfred
415480	419560	Bartlett believe that British fishers may well have established year-round habitation
419560	422000	on the islands decades prior.
422000	428180	Never settled in the 1820s or the 1720s, Little Bay Islands embodies the era of fish-fueled
428180	432760	European expansion, and without an abiding climate, or much in the way of arable land
432760	437540	for agriculture like its southern relatives off of Cape Cod, Little Bay Islands, from
437540	443280	its inception, would remain a strictly ocean-oriented economy.
443280	450000	From the 19th century to the mid-20th, Little Bay Islands enjoyed a period of blissful stasis.
450000	454780	By 1950, the town, along with the rest of Newfoundland, had become a part of Canada,
454780	458820	had added a few more saltbox homes, a couple new processing plants, and was sheltering
458820	461140	more modern boats in its harbor.
461140	467080	But still, Little Bay Islanders went out each day to work their corner of the cod industry.
467080	470480	At day's end, they picked their kids up from the schoolhouse and headed over to their
470480	472560	local union meetings.
472560	476600	When they had a chance, they caught up at the poacher's lounge for a drink.
476600	480260	When they made it to the weekend, they headed to the crowded grocery stores and crammed
480260	482960	into the town's two churches.
482960	486680	When winter turned to spring, they planted root vegetables in home gardens, awaiting
486680	489120	the peak summer fishing season.
489120	494220	And when they tired, after a long career, they handed their work off to their children.
494220	500360	At mid-century, Little Bay Islands still happily revolved around the same industry it always
500360	501360	had.
501360	508680	But, while change isn't always continuous, it is inevitable—and soon, intruding engines
508680	513180	of change showed up right off shore.
513180	517920	It came in the shape of a 280-foot British Fairtree trawling vessel appearing off the
517920	520800	coast of Newfoundland in 1951.
520800	525120	Alongside an invading fleet of smaller trawlers from across Europe, the Soviet Union, and
525120	530340	Japan, this would change cod fishing forever.
530340	534140	While outsiders weren't new, as fishers from as far as Portugal seasonally visited
534140	537300	Little Bay Islands, the technology was.
537300	544940	Then, all of a sudden, the draggers got involved where you could drop a net over the stern
544940	549620	of a boat or over the side for a side trawlers and go and drag the bottom over and whatever's
549620	553420	in front of that net certainly comes up, there's nothing left.
553420	558660	And not only were we taking a lot of cod, but we were taking a lot of bycatch too because,
558660	562780	I mean, if you add a lot of cod and there's other things in there, you just throw that
562780	564500	back in the ocean dead.
564500	569140	In just a decade, traditional methods used by local fishers for generations—hook and
569140	574540	line, nets, cod traps—were superseded by floating cities capable of hauling up tons
574540	578740	of fish and flash-freezing them, all while still at sea.
578740	583580	At the same time that massive ships consolidated the fishing industry, politicians sought to
583580	586620	consolidate Canada's coastal population.
586620	592060	In an effort to save on expensive government-provided services—ferries, power, healthcare—the
592060	597620	Centralization Program of 1954 and the Fisheries Household Resettlement Program of 1965 moved
597620	601080	thousands from remote outports to population centers.
601080	607020	In the 1950s and 60s, the waters around Little Bay Islands had become overcrowded, and towns
607020	611680	not so different from it began feeling pressure to relocate.
611680	616880	But not only did Little Bay Islands persist during this period, it thrived.
616880	622440	Its docks, shops, processing plants, churches, and school hummed with activity.
622440	626120	For the moment, there were enough fish to support both the cities at sea pulling it
626120	631520	in by the ton and the town's continued small-scale operations.
631520	634360	That moment, however, proved fleeting.
634360	640660	With innovation, mechanization, and the ruthless pursuit of efficiency came disaster.
640660	647660	By the 1970s, annual fish hauls were tripling the tonnage of those from three decades prior.
647660	650380	Cod populations couldn't keep up.
650380	655540	With collapse on the horizon, Canadian officials took action—turning back foreign vessels
655540	661700	and placing quotas on the fish—but it was far too little, far too late.
661700	666460	By 1990, in some spots, one could hardly find the fish at all.
667340	684820	In 1992, the Canadian government banned nearly all cod fishing.
684820	689820	The moratorium aimed to revive the stock over the course of a few years.
690060	696540	Today, nearly 30 years later, the moratorium is still in place.
696540	702060	The collapse of the cod industry put Little Bay Islands in an impossible position.
702060	708020	The town was, the town is, in many ways, a picture-perfect fishing community.
708020	712060	Little Bay Islands is one of the most beautiful communities around.
712060	716300	It's a beautiful harbor there.
716780	718340	In fact, there's two inlets there.
718340	720900	You can get a small boat on one end and a big boat through the other.
720900	722860	It was an island off of a harbor.
722860	724660	That's what it is.
724660	726700	And there's no odds how bad the weather gets.
726700	728740	It's still sheltered.
728740	732100	And I guess that's one of the reasons why it's not a very big island.
732100	736020	People had to go off the island and get enough wood to keep their stoves going
736020	737380	and for shipbuilding, that kind of thing.
737380	743820	Because according to islands out there, it was a small island.
743820	745620	But it was located to the fishing grounds.
746620	751180	Now, though, the most important fish was gone.
751180	755740	As an industry, fishing didn't line the pockets of Little Bay Islanders, it didn't
755740	760980	create massive financial wealth, but it did support a unique way of life.
760980	766180	It nurtured the small-town camaraderie that only blooms after decades of waiting together
766180	771660	in the same lines, singing the same hymns, and drinking the same draft beers.
771700	776820	It furthered family bonds as mothers and fathers taught their trades to daughters and sons.
776820	781380	As the rest of the world moved towards urban centers, Little Bay Islands offered an alternative
781380	787320	path for those enchanted by a rural, rugged lifestyle deeply entangled with the surrounding
787320	789060	landscape.
789060	794140	Fishing made it possible, and Little Bay Islands had stayed loyal.
794140	799640	The town had no backup plan—no alternative industry to pick up the slack should something
799640	801380	go awry.
801380	808020	Here, cod was king, and now cod was dead.
808020	814020	While fishing stayed a consistent economic driver for centuries, the actual day-to-day
814020	820100	practice has proved dynamic, requiring flexibility, and at times, mobility.
820100	825780	So resettlement is as much a part of outport life in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador
825780	829700	as the fishing that brought people there in the first place.
829700	833940	Some, the earliest seasonal fishing parties and later families relocating in search of
833940	837180	better home bases, moved by choice.
837180	842940	Others, indigenous peoples and outport communities deemed too far from urban hubs, were pushed
842940	845360	or forced to relocate.
845360	850860	While Little Bay Islands had dodged resettlement by choice or force for well over a century,
850860	855920	by the late 90s, it was becoming difficult to ignore the creeping thought that their
855920	860160	time to pull up stakes was quickly arriving.
860160	865200	In the years following the moratorium, Little Bay Islanders turned their efforts to crab,
865200	870440	fish, and capelin—fish that have kept Newfoundland's economy afloat through to today.
870440	875160	Yeah, so while the East Coast cod fishery collapse, what's popularly known as the
875160	881040	cod moratorium, happened in July of 1992 and is still underway today, I think what people
881040	887420	don't realize is that this is still a billion dollar industry, fisheries, and in the decade
887420	893080	that followed, you had 10% of the population of Newfoundland and Labrador move away.
893080	897600	As Little Bay Islands fishers moved to the mainland to find work, institutions that relied
897600	903760	on their presence—the grocery stores, churches, and school—began to falter.
903760	909900	In 2009, the crab processing plant, the town's last major employer, shuttered, leaving the
909900	915820	women who worked the plant little choice but to relocate or rely on unemployment programs.
915820	920540	In just a few decades, the bustling town, with boats whizzing past its wharves by day
920540	925860	and the poacher's lounge filling to standing room only by night, had taken on a melancholy
925860	927300	quiet.
927300	933160	As families peeled out of town one by one, the murmurs of whole-scale resettlement gained
933160	935060	momentum.
935060	940340	In Newfoundland and Labrador, the term resettlement is a loaded one.
940340	944580	I don't know, resettlement is a bad word for me, I mean, we did that back in Joey
944580	950220	Smalwell's day, and it was a terrible thing to do a brood of people that, you know, that
950220	954840	was there all their lives and didn't approve their one bit in the world.
954840	960300	In the wake of the cod collapse, the government revived the unpopular mid-century policy in
960300	961820	2010.
961820	966660	This time around, the resettlement program offered a proportionally larger payout, prohibited
966660	971240	the provincial government from initiating the process, and, if viable, required the
971240	975540	community to approve the decision by a 90% vote.
975540	981500	Still, more amenable terms aside, such a move was bound to hurt.
981500	987000	But I think the reason why it really strikes an emotional chord in Newfoundland and Labrador
987000	993140	is because it feels like the death of this way of life.
993140	997320	And so, you know, I felt that even when we sold my grandfather's home in Little Bay
997320	1003920	East, on the southern shores of Newfoundland and Labrador, you know, here I had this physical
1003920	1010120	link to a community that my ancestry was tied up in for hundreds of years.
1010120	1014360	And then, you know, for that to be gone and to not be able to have that physical link
1014360	1019600	to a place that I remember growing up and, you know, going with my father to his childhood
1019600	1026280	home and beachcombing along the beach and being able to go out on a dory with my family
1026280	1032540	members, you know, to have that access pulled is more than, you know, let's do something
1032540	1036000	different next year, summer vacation.
1036000	1041000	It's this connection to place and culture and heritage and tradition.
1041000	1044200	And so I think that's difficult for people.
1044200	1047360	Opportunity created Little Bay Islands.
1047360	1052240	When Opportunity died, the town was bound to soon follow.
1052240	1056600	As the grand banks clogged with oversized trawlers and fishing transformed from a timeless
1056600	1063120	profession to one with an expiration date, Alport youth began to look west for Opportunity.
1063120	1064120	Often this is what is happening.
1064120	1065120	There's no jobs.
1065120	1066120	Fun time.
1066120	1069200	And the fisher's gonna go, hey, it's summertime when you're out of school, you got a job
1069200	1070200	at a fish plant.
1070200	1073920	Working in a fish plant or you went on a boat with your father or went down on a wharf
1073920	1076760	cutting out tongs, you may have lived, but now there's nothing for them to do.
1076760	1080880	Come out of school, there's no very few places to pick up a job in Newfoundland and
1080880	1082360	Labrador today.
1082360	1086480	In many cases, their own families urged them to move on.
1086480	1087480	Absolutely.
1087480	1091780	I mean, my grandfather was the last fisherman in our family and that wasn't by accident,
1091780	1092780	that was by design.
1092780	1098600	You know, my grandfather and my grandmother wanted to make sure that their four boys had
1098600	1103720	an education and certainly Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are all educated, whether
1103720	1109260	that's on the land and sea or in a classroom, but they very much wanted their four boys
1109260	1115340	to receive a classroom education and to go on and have careers that allowed them to leave
1115340	1116380	the outboards.
1116380	1120560	As the hope that the fishery would soon recover faded, Little Bay Island's families and
1120560	1125640	youth made their way to the mainland, leaving behind an aging population deeply tied to
1125640	1131960	the landscape, but unmoored from economic opportunities and far from medical services.
1131960	1136720	With the processing plant shuttered, the school empty, the local bar dry, the fire department
1136720	1143640	closed, and the town doctor long gone, Little Bay Islands, in 2015, was a shell of its former
1143640	1144640	self.
1144640	1151120	For the 95 aging full-timers, 45 minutes away from medical facilities and grocery stores,
1151120	1156680	assuming fair weather, the time had arrived to put resettlement up for a vote.
1156680	1157680	The result?
1157680	1166240	85 votes for, 10 against—missing the required 90% benchmark by 0.53%.
1166240	1170200	Four years and zero miracles later, they voted again.
1170200	1177080	This time, it was unanimous—Little Bay Islands would resettle.
1177080	1181800	In the months following the vote, Little Bay Islanders soberly planned their next move,
1181800	1187320	packed their belongings, and, in some cases, converted their homes to operate off-grid,
1187320	1188880	anticipating summer visits.
1188880	1194880	In addition to the 250,000 Canadian dollars Little Bay Islanders were to receive for relocating,
1194880	1196840	they retained their property.
1196840	1201640	Gone, though, were the costly, government-supplied amenities.
1201640	1206360	No more power, no more snowplowing, and no more ferry service.
1206360	1210440	Those with unwavering bonds to the place where they grew up, where they raised families,
1210440	1213080	where they felt at home, would be back.
1213080	1215440	But it wouldn't be the same.
1215440	1217620	It couldn't be.
1217620	1223020	As the MV Hazel McIsaac disappeared into the December night, and the Parsons ducked back
1223020	1227840	into their newly off-grid home to ring in the new year, Little Bay Islands entered an
1227840	1231960	era both foreign and familiar.
1231960	1236320	However, were the centuries of permanent settlement, and decades of direct connection
1236320	1237640	to mainland Canada.
1237640	1242920	Returning, though, was the remoteness and self-sufficiency that defined the outport's
1242920	1248200	earliest days—a uniquely disconnected way of life that drew many to the islands in the
1248200	1249760	first place.
1249760	1255260	In recent years, seasonal visitors, sea kayakers, photographers, authors, and artists have descended
1255260	1260760	upon the striking landscapes and quaint coastal communities of the likes of Little Bay Islands.
1260760	1266120	And fishermen like Winfred Bartlett, and grandchildren of fishermen like Jen Thornhill-Verma, aren't
1266120	1269600	yet ready to agree to the devil's bargain that tourism presents.
1269600	1271840	In fact, my family still lives there.
1271840	1276220	As much as I'm proud that people go there to visit, I want people to go and stay for
1276220	1279720	a long time, not just a good time.
1279720	1283760	Staying for a long time, though, requires a healthy fishery.
1283760	1288520	A healthy fishery requires something that Newfoundland outport communities can't procure
1288520	1289720	on their own.
1289720	1297620	Future-forward, stringent, protective fishing policy at the national and international level.
1297620	1303120	Outports today, while built on a foundation of enterprising and independent spirit, bend
1303120	1305080	to global forces.
1305080	1310840	But then again, Little Bay Islands, and outports like it, have always been at the mercy of
1310840	1316680	economics and politics well beyond their wharves—spanning the Northern Atlantic and beyond.
1316680	1322280	It's likely too late for Little Bay Islands, but this doesn't have to be the end for
1322280	1323280	outports.
1323280	1327720	The lesson of Little Bay Islands is not that these places' rural, small-town lifestyle
1327720	1333260	can't exist—instead, it's that it can't exist in a vacuum.
1333260	1338480	While proudly independent and situated well on the periphery, the survival of these extremities
1338480	1342720	hinges on their relationships and ties to the center.
1342720	1348240	And while the people of outports get to decide when they resettle, it's much larger forces
1348240	1352040	that will decide if they have to.
