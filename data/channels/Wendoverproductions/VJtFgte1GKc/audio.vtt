00:00.000 --> 00:01.040
Hi there.

00:01.040 --> 00:05.480
Just before this video starts, I wanted to briefly explain what it is.

00:05.480 --> 00:10.240
About a week ago, we launched our first new channel in two years—Extremities.

00:10.240 --> 00:15.560
It's about why and how the world's most remote settlements exist, told with stunning

00:15.560 --> 00:19.720
visuals and exclusive interviews from these places.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.880
What you're about to watch is the first episode.

00:21.880 --> 00:27.620
It's about Little Bay Islands, a town that, for complex reasons, ceased to exist after

00:27.620 --> 00:30.500
December 31st, 2019.

00:30.500 --> 00:34.200
At the end of this, I'm not going to ask you to go sign up for CuriosityStream or to

00:34.200 --> 00:35.820
check out HelloFresh or anything.

00:35.820 --> 00:41.100
I'm just going to ask you, if you enjoyed this, to go subscribe to the Extremities channel

00:41.100 --> 00:46.340
and check out the two other videos there, because this is the only one that will ever

00:46.340 --> 00:49.180
go up on Wendover Productions.

00:49.180 --> 00:53.180
With that, please enjoy the video.

00:53.180 --> 01:02.460
At 5 PM, on December 31st, 2019, the MV Hazel McIsaac pulled away from Little Bay Islands.

01:02.460 --> 01:08.800
Onboard were the last few holdouts of those who had called the tiny island hamlet home.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.140
This would be the final time that the town's regular ferry service pushed off from the

01:13.140 --> 01:19.460
rustic collection of snow-dusted crimson, off-white, and beige saltbox homes.

01:19.460 --> 01:24.140
As it exited the protected harbor, the permanent population of Little Bay Islands plummeted

01:24.140 --> 01:27.740
from fifty-four to just two.

01:27.740 --> 01:32.980
For those on board, and the two still standing on shore, the weight of the moment hung heavy

01:32.980 --> 01:34.220
in the air.

01:34.220 --> 01:39.120
Mike Parsons, who along with his wife Georgina decided to stay, said of the final days that

01:39.120 --> 01:43.400
a, quote, palpable sadness had enveloped the islands.

01:43.400 --> 01:47.340
Although an all but inevitable conclusion, leaving hurt.

01:47.340 --> 01:54.780
This is nowhere, there's nothing else there, you know, but still the people got the love

01:54.780 --> 01:57.260
of the land where they were born, I mean, you know this.

01:57.260 --> 02:02.060
As the ferry cut through the low-hanging fog and faded away in the evening's dying light,

02:02.060 --> 02:07.420
and as the 2010s faded from present to past, a tiny town on a couple tiny islands closed

02:07.420 --> 02:12.180
a chapter of its story that had begun some 200 years prior.

02:12.180 --> 02:17.180
What was once a boomtown gone bust was now all but a ghost town.

02:17.180 --> 02:22.240
That day, electricity that had powered the H.L. Strong Academy, Aunt Edna's B&B, the

02:22.240 --> 02:27.860
two churches, and the dozens of hardly-built homes wrapping around the harbor shut off.

02:27.860 --> 02:33.120
Unopposed by streetlights and the hum of habitation, night and its accompanying quiet settled over

02:33.120 --> 02:37.980
the town of two, and Little Bay Islands became the eighth remote community in Newfoundland

02:37.980 --> 02:42.220
and Labrador this century to permanently relocate.

02:42.220 --> 02:45.860
The abandonment of Little Bay Islands, and the reason this small settlement existed in

02:45.860 --> 02:51.180
the first place, is enmeshed in the intertwined history, politics, and economics of the North

02:51.180 --> 02:56.260
Atlantic—all of which, across centuries of European settlement, have revolved around

02:56.260 --> 02:59.660
a rather nondescript fish.

02:59.660 --> 03:04.500
By the 2010s, Little Bay Islands, a name left plural to acknowledge the community straddling

03:04.500 --> 03:09.140
of both Little Bay and Mack Islands, was on its last leg.

03:09.140 --> 03:14.700
At its height, more than 500 called this small but bustling town nestled between the lush

03:14.700 --> 03:17.780
forest and rocky coast home.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.140
What brought people to Little Bay Islands, and the coast of Newfoundland, had little

03:21.140 --> 03:26.880
to do with what was on land, but rather what swam in the surrounding waters.

03:26.880 --> 03:31.140
But the reason why settlers, predominantly from Europe, came to Newfoundland and Labrador

03:31.140 --> 03:37.940
and populated the outports was because of the proximity to this lush resource of wild

03:37.940 --> 03:42.420
fish, and that continues to be the case.

03:42.420 --> 03:47.120
Starting with the Paleo-Eskimo peoples, arriving around 1000 BCE, then followed by the Little

03:47.120 --> 03:52.060
Passage peoples 2,000 years later, indigenous hunter-gatherer societies were the first to

03:52.060 --> 03:55.580
recognize the wealth of Newfoundland's teeming coasts.

03:55.580 --> 03:59.720
Not long after the Little Passage peoples had arrived, though, these waters became a

03:59.720 --> 04:01.780
bit busier.

04:01.780 --> 04:06.360
Northern and Western Europeans were next to identify the region's oceanic potential,

04:06.360 --> 04:11.940
and unlike contemporary explorers, they weren't there for god, but for cod.

04:11.940 --> 04:18.620
Simply put, cod, in my time I grew up and previous to that, cod was king.

04:18.620 --> 04:23.100
Cod's prominence—its centrality to life in Little Bay Islands and Newfoundland more

04:23.100 --> 04:30.040
broadly—spans well beyond Wilfred's lifetime, going back not just generations, but centuries.

04:30.040 --> 04:34.540
When Norse sailors landed on Newfoundland hundreds of years prior to Columbus's crossing,

04:34.540 --> 04:39.860
they skirted from one cold, barren shore to the next with little more than the prevalent,

04:39.860 --> 04:43.860
easy-to-catch, high-in-protein fish to fill their caloric needs.

04:43.860 --> 04:49.020
For the Europeans that followed, cod didn't just represent a calorie-dense source of sustenance,

04:49.020 --> 04:52.660
but a resource with which they could turn a profit.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.700
Although British and Basque fishing ventures kept tight-lips about their favorite spots,

04:56.700 --> 05:01.900
it's likely that enterprising vessels cut across the Atlantic alongside and even before

05:01.900 --> 05:05.200
Columbus and John Cabot in the 1490s.

05:05.200 --> 05:09.660
Once Cabot had come across Newfoundland, though, the secret was out, as the explorer exclaimed

05:09.660 --> 05:14.340
that these faraway waters were so well-stocked that all one had to do was stick a basket

05:14.340 --> 05:17.140
in the ocean and it fill with fish.

05:17.140 --> 05:22.220
While the European explorers carried with them a penchant to exaggerate, Cabot's description

05:22.220 --> 05:26.820
of fishing in the Northwest Atlantic maps rather accurately onto the disposition of

05:26.820 --> 05:28.420
the Atlantic cod.

05:28.420 --> 05:33.700
An omnivorous bottom-feeder, cod are both perpetually lethargic and ceaselessly hungry,

05:33.700 --> 05:38.700
and as such, gladly take bait and don't put up much of a fight once on a line.

05:38.700 --> 05:42.860
Properly treated, cod keeps, too.

05:42.860 --> 05:50.380
And cod, one thing about cod, was all salt, put under salt back there then.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.700
So I mean you could keep it for a long, long time, a year, two years, three years if you

05:53.700 --> 05:54.700
want to.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
I don't know how long you could if you really needed it.

05:56.700 --> 06:03.820
But usually it was cut, split, and salted, and then taken back to England and Portugal

06:03.820 --> 06:05.320
and Spain.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.600
These that, as Catholic, were eager to find alternatives to warm-blooded meats during

06:09.600 --> 06:10.600
Lent.

06:10.600 --> 06:15.040
As the fish gained popularity across Europe, becoming a staple in markets in the 1500s,

06:15.040 --> 06:19.320
and appearing in the pages of Cervantes' Don Quixote, Zola's The Belly of Paris,

06:19.320 --> 06:24.320
and Dumas' Le Grand Dix-Jonaire de Cuisine, European settlements took root along the rocky

06:24.320 --> 06:27.240
shores of the continent's northeastern coast.

06:27.240 --> 06:32.920
These hardy, self-reliant coastal communities, now known as outports, drove the growth of

06:32.920 --> 06:36.040
Newfoundland from the 1700s onwards.

06:36.040 --> 06:40.760
Built on and around the water, Little Bay Islands, only accessible by boat, angling

06:40.760 --> 06:44.720
out to the rich waters of the Notre Dame Bay and the Grand Banks beyond, but hugging the

06:44.720 --> 06:50.360
fragmented and protective coast of Newfoundland, was the quintessential outport.

06:50.360 --> 06:55.480
The earliest census of Little Bay Islands dates to 1825, but some locals like Wilfred

06:55.480 --> 06:59.560
Bartlett believe that British fishers may well have established year-round habitation

06:59.560 --> 07:02.000
on the islands decades prior.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.180
Never settled in the 1820s or the 1720s, Little Bay Islands embodies the era of fish-fueled

07:08.180 --> 07:12.760
European expansion, and without an abiding climate, or much in the way of arable land

07:12.760 --> 07:17.540
for agriculture like its southern relatives off of Cape Cod, Little Bay Islands, from

07:17.540 --> 07:23.280
its inception, would remain a strictly ocean-oriented economy.

07:23.280 --> 07:30.000
From the 19th century to the mid-20th, Little Bay Islands enjoyed a period of blissful stasis.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.780
By 1950, the town, along with the rest of Newfoundland, had become a part of Canada,

07:34.780 --> 07:38.820
had added a few more saltbox homes, a couple new processing plants, and was sheltering

07:38.820 --> 07:41.140
more modern boats in its harbor.

07:41.140 --> 07:47.080
But still, Little Bay Islanders went out each day to work their corner of the cod industry.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.480
At day's end, they picked their kids up from the schoolhouse and headed over to their

07:50.480 --> 07:52.560
local union meetings.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.600
When they had a chance, they caught up at the poacher's lounge for a drink.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.260
When they made it to the weekend, they headed to the crowded grocery stores and crammed

08:00.260 --> 08:02.960
into the town's two churches.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.680
When winter turned to spring, they planted root vegetables in home gardens, awaiting

08:06.680 --> 08:09.120
the peak summer fishing season.

08:09.120 --> 08:14.220
And when they tired, after a long career, they handed their work off to their children.

08:14.220 --> 08:20.360
At mid-century, Little Bay Islands still happily revolved around the same industry it always

08:20.360 --> 08:21.360
had.

08:21.360 --> 08:28.680
But, while change isn't always continuous, it is inevitable—and soon, intruding engines

08:28.680 --> 08:33.180
of change showed up right off shore.

08:33.180 --> 08:37.920
It came in the shape of a 280-foot British Fairtree trawling vessel appearing off the

08:37.920 --> 08:40.800
coast of Newfoundland in 1951.

08:40.800 --> 08:45.120
Alongside an invading fleet of smaller trawlers from across Europe, the Soviet Union, and

08:45.120 --> 08:50.340
Japan, this would change cod fishing forever.

08:50.340 --> 08:54.140
While outsiders weren't new, as fishers from as far as Portugal seasonally visited

08:54.140 --> 08:57.300
Little Bay Islands, the technology was.

08:57.300 --> 09:04.940
Then, all of a sudden, the draggers got involved where you could drop a net over the stern

09:04.940 --> 09:09.620
of a boat or over the side for a side trawlers and go and drag the bottom over and whatever's

09:09.620 --> 09:13.420
in front of that net certainly comes up, there's nothing left.

09:13.420 --> 09:18.660
And not only were we taking a lot of cod, but we were taking a lot of bycatch too because,

09:18.660 --> 09:22.780
I mean, if you add a lot of cod and there's other things in there, you just throw that

09:22.780 --> 09:24.500
back in the ocean dead.

09:24.500 --> 09:29.140
In just a decade, traditional methods used by local fishers for generations—hook and

09:29.140 --> 09:34.540
line, nets, cod traps—were superseded by floating cities capable of hauling up tons

09:34.540 --> 09:38.740
of fish and flash-freezing them, all while still at sea.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.580
At the same time that massive ships consolidated the fishing industry, politicians sought to

09:43.580 --> 09:46.620
consolidate Canada's coastal population.

09:46.620 --> 09:52.060
In an effort to save on expensive government-provided services—ferries, power, healthcare—the

09:52.060 --> 09:57.620
Centralization Program of 1954 and the Fisheries Household Resettlement Program of 1965 moved

09:57.620 --> 10:01.080
thousands from remote outports to population centers.

10:01.080 --> 10:07.020
In the 1950s and 60s, the waters around Little Bay Islands had become overcrowded, and towns

10:07.020 --> 10:11.680
not so different from it began feeling pressure to relocate.

10:11.680 --> 10:16.880
But not only did Little Bay Islands persist during this period, it thrived.

10:16.880 --> 10:22.440
Its docks, shops, processing plants, churches, and school hummed with activity.

10:22.440 --> 10:26.120
For the moment, there were enough fish to support both the cities at sea pulling it

10:26.120 --> 10:31.520
in by the ton and the town's continued small-scale operations.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.360
That moment, however, proved fleeting.

10:34.360 --> 10:40.660
With innovation, mechanization, and the ruthless pursuit of efficiency came disaster.

10:40.660 --> 10:47.660
By the 1970s, annual fish hauls were tripling the tonnage of those from three decades prior.

10:47.660 --> 10:50.380
Cod populations couldn't keep up.

10:50.380 --> 10:55.540
With collapse on the horizon, Canadian officials took action—turning back foreign vessels

10:55.540 --> 11:01.700
and placing quotas on the fish—but it was far too little, far too late.

11:01.700 --> 11:06.460
By 1990, in some spots, one could hardly find the fish at all.

11:07.340 --> 11:24.820
In 1992, the Canadian government banned nearly all cod fishing.

11:24.820 --> 11:29.820
The moratorium aimed to revive the stock over the course of a few years.

11:30.060 --> 11:36.540
Today, nearly 30 years later, the moratorium is still in place.

11:36.540 --> 11:42.060
The collapse of the cod industry put Little Bay Islands in an impossible position.

11:42.060 --> 11:48.020
The town was, the town is, in many ways, a picture-perfect fishing community.

11:48.020 --> 11:52.060
Little Bay Islands is one of the most beautiful communities around.

11:52.060 --> 11:56.300
It's a beautiful harbor there.

11:56.780 --> 11:58.340
In fact, there's two inlets there.

11:58.340 --> 12:00.900
You can get a small boat on one end and a big boat through the other.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.860
It was an island off of a harbor.

12:02.860 --> 12:04.660
That's what it is.

12:04.660 --> 12:06.700
And there's no odds how bad the weather gets.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.740
It's still sheltered.

12:08.740 --> 12:12.100
And I guess that's one of the reasons why it's not a very big island.

12:12.100 --> 12:16.020
People had to go off the island and get enough wood to keep their stoves going

12:16.020 --> 12:17.380
and for shipbuilding, that kind of thing.

12:17.380 --> 12:23.820
Because according to islands out there, it was a small island.

12:23.820 --> 12:25.620
But it was located to the fishing grounds.

12:26.620 --> 12:31.180
Now, though, the most important fish was gone.

12:31.180 --> 12:35.740
As an industry, fishing didn't line the pockets of Little Bay Islanders, it didn't

12:35.740 --> 12:40.980
create massive financial wealth, but it did support a unique way of life.

12:40.980 --> 12:46.180
It nurtured the small-town camaraderie that only blooms after decades of waiting together

12:46.180 --> 12:51.660
in the same lines, singing the same hymns, and drinking the same draft beers.

12:51.700 --> 12:56.820
It furthered family bonds as mothers and fathers taught their trades to daughters and sons.

12:56.820 --> 13:01.380
As the rest of the world moved towards urban centers, Little Bay Islands offered an alternative

13:01.380 --> 13:07.320
path for those enchanted by a rural, rugged lifestyle deeply entangled with the surrounding

13:07.320 --> 13:09.060
landscape.

13:09.060 --> 13:14.140
Fishing made it possible, and Little Bay Islands had stayed loyal.

13:14.140 --> 13:19.640
The town had no backup plan—no alternative industry to pick up the slack should something

13:19.640 --> 13:21.380
go awry.

13:21.380 --> 13:28.020
Here, cod was king, and now cod was dead.

13:28.020 --> 13:34.020
While fishing stayed a consistent economic driver for centuries, the actual day-to-day

13:34.020 --> 13:40.100
practice has proved dynamic, requiring flexibility, and at times, mobility.

13:40.100 --> 13:45.780
So resettlement is as much a part of outport life in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador

13:45.780 --> 13:49.700
as the fishing that brought people there in the first place.

13:49.700 --> 13:53.940
Some, the earliest seasonal fishing parties and later families relocating in search of

13:53.940 --> 13:57.180
better home bases, moved by choice.

13:57.180 --> 14:02.940
Others, indigenous peoples and outport communities deemed too far from urban hubs, were pushed

14:02.940 --> 14:05.360
or forced to relocate.

14:05.360 --> 14:10.860
While Little Bay Islands had dodged resettlement by choice or force for well over a century,

14:10.860 --> 14:15.920
by the late 90s, it was becoming difficult to ignore the creeping thought that their

14:15.920 --> 14:20.160
time to pull up stakes was quickly arriving.

14:20.160 --> 14:25.200
In the years following the moratorium, Little Bay Islanders turned their efforts to crab,

14:25.200 --> 14:30.440
fish, and capelin—fish that have kept Newfoundland's economy afloat through to today.

14:30.440 --> 14:35.160
Yeah, so while the East Coast cod fishery collapse, what's popularly known as the

14:35.160 --> 14:41.040
cod moratorium, happened in July of 1992 and is still underway today, I think what people

14:41.040 --> 14:47.420
don't realize is that this is still a billion dollar industry, fisheries, and in the decade

14:47.420 --> 14:53.080
that followed, you had 10% of the population of Newfoundland and Labrador move away.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.600
As Little Bay Islands fishers moved to the mainland to find work, institutions that relied

14:57.600 --> 15:03.760
on their presence—the grocery stores, churches, and school—began to falter.

15:03.760 --> 15:09.900
In 2009, the crab processing plant, the town's last major employer, shuttered, leaving the

15:09.900 --> 15:15.820
women who worked the plant little choice but to relocate or rely on unemployment programs.

15:15.820 --> 15:20.540
In just a few decades, the bustling town, with boats whizzing past its wharves by day

15:20.540 --> 15:25.860
and the poacher's lounge filling to standing room only by night, had taken on a melancholy

15:25.860 --> 15:27.300
quiet.

15:27.300 --> 15:33.160
As families peeled out of town one by one, the murmurs of whole-scale resettlement gained

15:33.160 --> 15:35.060
momentum.

15:35.060 --> 15:40.340
In Newfoundland and Labrador, the term resettlement is a loaded one.

15:40.340 --> 15:44.580
I don't know, resettlement is a bad word for me, I mean, we did that back in Joey

15:44.580 --> 15:50.220
Smalwell's day, and it was a terrible thing to do a brood of people that, you know, that

15:50.220 --> 15:54.840
was there all their lives and didn't approve their one bit in the world.

15:54.840 --> 16:00.300
In the wake of the cod collapse, the government revived the unpopular mid-century policy in

16:00.300 --> 16:01.820
2010.

16:01.820 --> 16:06.660
This time around, the resettlement program offered a proportionally larger payout, prohibited

16:06.660 --> 16:11.240
the provincial government from initiating the process, and, if viable, required the

16:11.240 --> 16:15.540
community to approve the decision by a 90% vote.

16:15.540 --> 16:21.500
Still, more amenable terms aside, such a move was bound to hurt.

16:21.500 --> 16:27.000
But I think the reason why it really strikes an emotional chord in Newfoundland and Labrador

16:27.000 --> 16:33.140
is because it feels like the death of this way of life.

16:33.140 --> 16:37.320
And so, you know, I felt that even when we sold my grandfather's home in Little Bay

16:37.320 --> 16:43.920
East, on the southern shores of Newfoundland and Labrador, you know, here I had this physical

16:43.920 --> 16:50.120
link to a community that my ancestry was tied up in for hundreds of years.

16:50.120 --> 16:54.360
And then, you know, for that to be gone and to not be able to have that physical link

16:54.360 --> 16:59.600
to a place that I remember growing up and, you know, going with my father to his childhood

16:59.600 --> 17:06.280
home and beachcombing along the beach and being able to go out on a dory with my family

17:06.280 --> 17:12.540
members, you know, to have that access pulled is more than, you know, let's do something

17:12.540 --> 17:16.000
different next year, summer vacation.

17:16.000 --> 17:21.000
It's this connection to place and culture and heritage and tradition.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.200
And so I think that's difficult for people.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.360
Opportunity created Little Bay Islands.

17:27.360 --> 17:32.240
When Opportunity died, the town was bound to soon follow.

17:32.240 --> 17:36.600
As the grand banks clogged with oversized trawlers and fishing transformed from a timeless

17:36.600 --> 17:43.120
profession to one with an expiration date, Alport youth began to look west for Opportunity.

17:43.120 --> 17:44.120
Often this is what is happening.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
There's no jobs.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.120
Fun time.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.200
And the fisher's gonna go, hey, it's summertime when you're out of school, you got a job

17:49.200 --> 17:50.200
at a fish plant.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.920
Working in a fish plant or you went on a boat with your father or went down on a wharf

17:53.920 --> 17:56.760
cutting out tongs, you may have lived, but now there's nothing for them to do.

17:56.760 --> 18:00.880
Come out of school, there's no very few places to pick up a job in Newfoundland and

18:00.880 --> 18:02.360
Labrador today.

18:02.360 --> 18:06.480
In many cases, their own families urged them to move on.

18:06.480 --> 18:07.480
Absolutely.

18:07.480 --> 18:11.780
I mean, my grandfather was the last fisherman in our family and that wasn't by accident,

18:11.780 --> 18:12.780
that was by design.

18:12.780 --> 18:18.600
You know, my grandfather and my grandmother wanted to make sure that their four boys had

18:18.600 --> 18:23.720
an education and certainly Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are all educated, whether

18:23.720 --> 18:29.260
that's on the land and sea or in a classroom, but they very much wanted their four boys

18:29.260 --> 18:35.340
to receive a classroom education and to go on and have careers that allowed them to leave

18:35.340 --> 18:36.380
the outboards.

18:36.380 --> 18:40.560
As the hope that the fishery would soon recover faded, Little Bay Island's families and

18:40.560 --> 18:45.640
youth made their way to the mainland, leaving behind an aging population deeply tied to

18:45.640 --> 18:51.960
the landscape, but unmoored from economic opportunities and far from medical services.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.720
With the processing plant shuttered, the school empty, the local bar dry, the fire department

18:56.720 --> 19:03.640
closed, and the town doctor long gone, Little Bay Islands, in 2015, was a shell of its former

19:03.640 --> 19:04.640
self.

19:04.640 --> 19:11.120
For the 95 aging full-timers, 45 minutes away from medical facilities and grocery stores,

19:11.120 --> 19:16.680
assuming fair weather, the time had arrived to put resettlement up for a vote.

19:16.680 --> 19:17.680
The result?

19:17.680 --> 19:26.240
85 votes for, 10 against—missing the required 90% benchmark by 0.53%.

19:26.240 --> 19:30.200
Four years and zero miracles later, they voted again.

19:30.200 --> 19:37.080
This time, it was unanimous—Little Bay Islands would resettle.

19:37.080 --> 19:41.800
In the months following the vote, Little Bay Islanders soberly planned their next move,

19:41.800 --> 19:47.320
packed their belongings, and, in some cases, converted their homes to operate off-grid,

19:47.320 --> 19:48.880
anticipating summer visits.

19:48.880 --> 19:54.880
In addition to the 250,000 Canadian dollars Little Bay Islanders were to receive for relocating,

19:54.880 --> 19:56.840
they retained their property.

19:56.840 --> 20:01.640
Gone, though, were the costly, government-supplied amenities.

20:01.640 --> 20:06.360
No more power, no more snowplowing, and no more ferry service.

20:06.360 --> 20:10.440
Those with unwavering bonds to the place where they grew up, where they raised families,

20:10.440 --> 20:13.080
where they felt at home, would be back.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.440
But it wouldn't be the same.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.620
It couldn't be.

20:17.620 --> 20:23.020
As the MV Hazel McIsaac disappeared into the December night, and the Parsons ducked back

20:23.020 --> 20:27.840
into their newly off-grid home to ring in the new year, Little Bay Islands entered an

20:27.840 --> 20:31.960
era both foreign and familiar.

20:31.960 --> 20:36.320
However, were the centuries of permanent settlement, and decades of direct connection

20:36.320 --> 20:37.640
to mainland Canada.

20:37.640 --> 20:42.920
Returning, though, was the remoteness and self-sufficiency that defined the outport's

20:42.920 --> 20:48.200
earliest days—a uniquely disconnected way of life that drew many to the islands in the

20:48.200 --> 20:49.760
first place.

20:49.760 --> 20:55.260
In recent years, seasonal visitors, sea kayakers, photographers, authors, and artists have descended

20:55.260 --> 21:00.760
upon the striking landscapes and quaint coastal communities of the likes of Little Bay Islands.

21:00.760 --> 21:06.120
And fishermen like Winfred Bartlett, and grandchildren of fishermen like Jen Thornhill-Verma, aren't

21:06.120 --> 21:09.600
yet ready to agree to the devil's bargain that tourism presents.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.840
In fact, my family still lives there.

21:11.840 --> 21:16.220
As much as I'm proud that people go there to visit, I want people to go and stay for

21:16.220 --> 21:19.720
a long time, not just a good time.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.760
Staying for a long time, though, requires a healthy fishery.

21:23.760 --> 21:28.520
A healthy fishery requires something that Newfoundland outport communities can't procure

21:28.520 --> 21:29.720
on their own.

21:29.720 --> 21:37.620
Future-forward, stringent, protective fishing policy at the national and international level.

21:37.620 --> 21:43.120
Outports today, while built on a foundation of enterprising and independent spirit, bend

21:43.120 --> 21:45.080
to global forces.

21:45.080 --> 21:50.840
But then again, Little Bay Islands, and outports like it, have always been at the mercy of

21:50.840 --> 21:56.680
economics and politics well beyond their wharves—spanning the Northern Atlantic and beyond.

21:56.680 --> 22:02.280
It's likely too late for Little Bay Islands, but this doesn't have to be the end for

22:02.280 --> 22:03.280
outports.

22:03.280 --> 22:07.720
The lesson of Little Bay Islands is not that these places' rural, small-town lifestyle

22:07.720 --> 22:13.260
can't exist—instead, it's that it can't exist in a vacuum.

22:13.260 --> 22:18.480
While proudly independent and situated well on the periphery, the survival of these extremities

22:18.480 --> 22:22.720
hinges on their relationships and ties to the center.

22:22.720 --> 22:28.240
And while the people of outports get to decide when they resettle, it's much larger forces

22:28.240 --> 22:32.040
that will decide if they have to.

22:32.040 --> 22:34.040
