00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,480
Just before this video starts, I wanted to briefly explain what it is.

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,240
About a week ago, we launched our first new channel in two years—Extremities.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,560
It's about why and how the world's most remote settlements exist, told with stunning

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,720
visuals and exclusive interviews from these places.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,880
What you're about to watch is the first episode.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,620
It's about Little Bay Islands, a town that, for complex reasons, ceased to exist after

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,500
December 31st, 2019.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,200
At the end of this, I'm not going to ask you to go sign up for CuriosityStream or to

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,820
check out HelloFresh or anything.

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,100
I'm just going to ask you, if you enjoyed this, to go subscribe to the Extremities channel

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,340
and check out the two other videos there, because this is the only one that will ever

13
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,180
go up on Wendover Productions.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,180
With that, please enjoy the video.

15
00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:02,460
At 5 PM, on December 31st, 2019, the MV Hazel McIsaac pulled away from Little Bay Islands.

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,800
Onboard were the last few holdouts of those who had called the tiny island hamlet home.

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,140
This would be the final time that the town's regular ferry service pushed off from the

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,460
rustic collection of snow-dusted crimson, off-white, and beige saltbox homes.

19
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,140
As it exited the protected harbor, the permanent population of Little Bay Islands plummeted

20
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,740
from fifty-four to just two.

21
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,980
For those on board, and the two still standing on shore, the weight of the moment hung heavy

22
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,220
in the air.

23
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,120
Mike Parsons, who along with his wife Georgina decided to stay, said of the final days that

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,400
a, quote, palpable sadness had enveloped the islands.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,340
Although an all but inevitable conclusion, leaving hurt.

26
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,780
This is nowhere, there's nothing else there, you know, but still the people got the love

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,260
of the land where they were born, I mean, you know this.

28
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,060
As the ferry cut through the low-hanging fog and faded away in the evening's dying light,

29
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,420
and as the 2010s faded from present to past, a tiny town on a couple tiny islands closed

30
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,180
a chapter of its story that had begun some 200 years prior.

31
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,180
What was once a boomtown gone bust was now all but a ghost town.

32
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,240
That day, electricity that had powered the H.L. Strong Academy, Aunt Edna's B&B, the

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,860
two churches, and the dozens of hardly-built homes wrapping around the harbor shut off.

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,120
Unopposed by streetlights and the hum of habitation, night and its accompanying quiet settled over

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,980
the town of two, and Little Bay Islands became the eighth remote community in Newfoundland

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,220
and Labrador this century to permanently relocate.

37
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,860
The abandonment of Little Bay Islands, and the reason this small settlement existed in

38
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,180
the first place, is enmeshed in the intertwined history, politics, and economics of the North

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,260
Atlantic—all of which, across centuries of European settlement, have revolved around

40
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,660
a rather nondescript fish.

41
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,500
By the 2010s, Little Bay Islands, a name left plural to acknowledge the community straddling

42
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,140
of both Little Bay and Mack Islands, was on its last leg.

43
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,700
At its height, more than 500 called this small but bustling town nestled between the lush

44
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,780
forest and rocky coast home.

45
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,140
What brought people to Little Bay Islands, and the coast of Newfoundland, had little

46
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,880
to do with what was on land, but rather what swam in the surrounding waters.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,140
But the reason why settlers, predominantly from Europe, came to Newfoundland and Labrador

48
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,940
and populated the outports was because of the proximity to this lush resource of wild

49
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,420
fish, and that continues to be the case.

50
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,120
Starting with the Paleo-Eskimo peoples, arriving around 1000 BCE, then followed by the Little

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,060
Passage peoples 2,000 years later, indigenous hunter-gatherer societies were the first to

52
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,580
recognize the wealth of Newfoundland's teeming coasts.

53
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,720
Not long after the Little Passage peoples had arrived, though, these waters became a

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,780
bit busier.

55
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,360
Northern and Western Europeans were next to identify the region's oceanic potential,

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,940
and unlike contemporary explorers, they weren't there for god, but for cod.

57
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,620
Simply put, cod, in my time I grew up and previous to that, cod was king.

58
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:23,100
Cod's prominence—its centrality to life in Little Bay Islands and Newfoundland more

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:30,040
broadly—spans well beyond Wilfred's lifetime, going back not just generations, but centuries.

60
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,540
When Norse sailors landed on Newfoundland hundreds of years prior to Columbus's crossing,

61
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,860
they skirted from one cold, barren shore to the next with little more than the prevalent,

62
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,860
easy-to-catch, high-in-protein fish to fill their caloric needs.

63
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,020
For the Europeans that followed, cod didn't just represent a calorie-dense source of sustenance,

64
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,660
but a resource with which they could turn a profit.

65
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,700
Although British and Basque fishing ventures kept tight-lips about their favorite spots,

66
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,900
it's likely that enterprising vessels cut across the Atlantic alongside and even before

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,200
Columbus and John Cabot in the 1490s.

68
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,660
Once Cabot had come across Newfoundland, though, the secret was out, as the explorer exclaimed

69
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,340
that these faraway waters were so well-stocked that all one had to do was stick a basket

70
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,140
in the ocean and it fill with fish.

71
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,220
While the European explorers carried with them a penchant to exaggerate, Cabot's description

72
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,820
of fishing in the Northwest Atlantic maps rather accurately onto the disposition of

73
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,420
the Atlantic cod.

74
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,700
An omnivorous bottom-feeder, cod are both perpetually lethargic and ceaselessly hungry,

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:38,700
and as such, gladly take bait and don't put up much of a fight once on a line.

76
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,860
Properly treated, cod keeps, too.

77
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:50,380
And cod, one thing about cod, was all salt, put under salt back there then.

78
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,700
So I mean you could keep it for a long, long time, a year, two years, three years if you

79
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
want to.

80
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,700
I don't know how long you could if you really needed it.

81
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:03,820
But usually it was cut, split, and salted, and then taken back to England and Portugal

82
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,320
and Spain.

83
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,600
These that, as Catholic, were eager to find alternatives to warm-blooded meats during

84
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Lent.

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,040
As the fish gained popularity across Europe, becoming a staple in markets in the 1500s,

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,320
and appearing in the pages of Cervantes' Don Quixote, Zola's The Belly of Paris,

87
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,320
and Dumas' Le Grand Dix-Jonaire de Cuisine, European settlements took root along the rocky

88
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,240
shores of the continent's northeastern coast.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,920
These hardy, self-reliant coastal communities, now known as outports, drove the growth of

90
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,040
Newfoundland from the 1700s onwards.

91
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,760
Built on and around the water, Little Bay Islands, only accessible by boat, angling

92
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,720
out to the rich waters of the Notre Dame Bay and the Grand Banks beyond, but hugging the

93
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,360
fragmented and protective coast of Newfoundland, was the quintessential outport.

94
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,480
The earliest census of Little Bay Islands dates to 1825, but some locals like Wilfred

95
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,560
Bartlett believe that British fishers may well have established year-round habitation

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,000
on the islands decades prior.

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,180
Never settled in the 1820s or the 1720s, Little Bay Islands embodies the era of fish-fueled

98
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,760
European expansion, and without an abiding climate, or much in the way of arable land

99
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,540
for agriculture like its southern relatives off of Cape Cod, Little Bay Islands, from

100
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:23,280
its inception, would remain a strictly ocean-oriented economy.

101
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,000
From the 19th century to the mid-20th, Little Bay Islands enjoyed a period of blissful stasis.

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,780
By 1950, the town, along with the rest of Newfoundland, had become a part of Canada,

103
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:38,820
had added a few more saltbox homes, a couple new processing plants, and was sheltering

104
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,140
more modern boats in its harbor.

105
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:47,080
But still, Little Bay Islanders went out each day to work their corner of the cod industry.

106
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,480
At day's end, they picked their kids up from the schoolhouse and headed over to their

107
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,560
local union meetings.

108
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,600
When they had a chance, they caught up at the poacher's lounge for a drink.

109
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,260
When they made it to the weekend, they headed to the crowded grocery stores and crammed

110
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,960
into the town's two churches.

111
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,680
When winter turned to spring, they planted root vegetables in home gardens, awaiting

112
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,120
the peak summer fishing season.

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,220
And when they tired, after a long career, they handed their work off to their children.

114
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,360
At mid-century, Little Bay Islands still happily revolved around the same industry it always

115
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
had.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,680
But, while change isn't always continuous, it is inevitable—and soon, intruding engines

117
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,180
of change showed up right off shore.

118
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,920
It came in the shape of a 280-foot British Fairtree trawling vessel appearing off the

119
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,800
coast of Newfoundland in 1951.

120
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,120
Alongside an invading fleet of smaller trawlers from across Europe, the Soviet Union, and

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,340
Japan, this would change cod fishing forever.

122
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,140
While outsiders weren't new, as fishers from as far as Portugal seasonally visited

123
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,300
Little Bay Islands, the technology was.

124
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:04,940
Then, all of a sudden, the draggers got involved where you could drop a net over the stern

125
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,620
of a boat or over the side for a side trawlers and go and drag the bottom over and whatever's

126
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,420
in front of that net certainly comes up, there's nothing left.

127
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,660
And not only were we taking a lot of cod, but we were taking a lot of bycatch too because,

128
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,780
I mean, if you add a lot of cod and there's other things in there, you just throw that

129
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,500
back in the ocean dead.

130
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,140
In just a decade, traditional methods used by local fishers for generations—hook and

131
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:34,540
line, nets, cod traps—were superseded by floating cities capable of hauling up tons

132
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,740
of fish and flash-freezing them, all while still at sea.

133
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,580
At the same time that massive ships consolidated the fishing industry, politicians sought to

134
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,620
consolidate Canada's coastal population.

135
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,060
In an effort to save on expensive government-provided services—ferries, power, healthcare—the

136
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,620
Centralization Program of 1954 and the Fisheries Household Resettlement Program of 1965 moved

137
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,080
thousands from remote outports to population centers.

138
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,020
In the 1950s and 60s, the waters around Little Bay Islands had become overcrowded, and towns

139
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,680
not so different from it began feeling pressure to relocate.

140
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,880
But not only did Little Bay Islands persist during this period, it thrived.

141
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,440
Its docks, shops, processing plants, churches, and school hummed with activity.

142
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,120
For the moment, there were enough fish to support both the cities at sea pulling it

143
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,520
in by the ton and the town's continued small-scale operations.

144
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,360
That moment, however, proved fleeting.

145
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,660
With innovation, mechanization, and the ruthless pursuit of efficiency came disaster.

146
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:47,660
By the 1970s, annual fish hauls were tripling the tonnage of those from three decades prior.

147
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,380
Cod populations couldn't keep up.

148
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,540
With collapse on the horizon, Canadian officials took action—turning back foreign vessels

149
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,700
and placing quotas on the fish—but it was far too little, far too late.

150
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,460
By 1990, in some spots, one could hardly find the fish at all.

151
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:24,820
In 1992, the Canadian government banned nearly all cod fishing.

152
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:29,820
The moratorium aimed to revive the stock over the course of a few years.

153
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:36,540
Today, nearly 30 years later, the moratorium is still in place.

154
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,060
The collapse of the cod industry put Little Bay Islands in an impossible position.

155
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:48,020
The town was, the town is, in many ways, a picture-perfect fishing community.

156
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:52,060
Little Bay Islands is one of the most beautiful communities around.

157
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,300
It's a beautiful harbor there.

158
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,340
In fact, there's two inlets there.

159
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,900
You can get a small boat on one end and a big boat through the other.

160
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,860
It was an island off of a harbor.

161
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,660
That's what it is.

162
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,700
And there's no odds how bad the weather gets.

163
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,740
It's still sheltered.

164
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,100
And I guess that's one of the reasons why it's not a very big island.

165
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,020
People had to go off the island and get enough wood to keep their stoves going

166
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,380
and for shipbuilding, that kind of thing.

167
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,820
Because according to islands out there, it was a small island.

168
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,620
But it was located to the fishing grounds.

169
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,180
Now, though, the most important fish was gone.

170
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:35,740
As an industry, fishing didn't line the pockets of Little Bay Islanders, it didn't

171
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,980
create massive financial wealth, but it did support a unique way of life.

172
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,180
It nurtured the small-town camaraderie that only blooms after decades of waiting together

173
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,660
in the same lines, singing the same hymns, and drinking the same draft beers.

174
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,820
It furthered family bonds as mothers and fathers taught their trades to daughters and sons.

175
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,380
As the rest of the world moved towards urban centers, Little Bay Islands offered an alternative

176
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,320
path for those enchanted by a rural, rugged lifestyle deeply entangled with the surrounding

177
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,060
landscape.

178
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:14,140
Fishing made it possible, and Little Bay Islands had stayed loyal.

179
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,640
The town had no backup plan—no alternative industry to pick up the slack should something

180
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,380
go awry.

181
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:28,020
Here, cod was king, and now cod was dead.

182
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:34,020
While fishing stayed a consistent economic driver for centuries, the actual day-to-day

183
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:40,100
practice has proved dynamic, requiring flexibility, and at times, mobility.

184
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:45,780
So resettlement is as much a part of outport life in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador

185
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,700
as the fishing that brought people there in the first place.

186
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,940
Some, the earliest seasonal fishing parties and later families relocating in search of

187
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,180
better home bases, moved by choice.

188
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:02,940
Others, indigenous peoples and outport communities deemed too far from urban hubs, were pushed

189
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,360
or forced to relocate.

190
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,860
While Little Bay Islands had dodged resettlement by choice or force for well over a century,

191
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,920
by the late 90s, it was becoming difficult to ignore the creeping thought that their

192
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,160
time to pull up stakes was quickly arriving.

193
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,200
In the years following the moratorium, Little Bay Islanders turned their efforts to crab,

194
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,440
fish, and capelin—fish that have kept Newfoundland's economy afloat through to today.

195
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,160
Yeah, so while the East Coast cod fishery collapse, what's popularly known as the

196
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,040
cod moratorium, happened in July of 1992 and is still underway today, I think what people

197
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,420
don't realize is that this is still a billion dollar industry, fisheries, and in the decade

198
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,080
that followed, you had 10% of the population of Newfoundland and Labrador move away.

199
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,600
As Little Bay Islands fishers moved to the mainland to find work, institutions that relied

200
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,760
on their presence—the grocery stores, churches, and school—began to falter.

201
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,900
In 2009, the crab processing plant, the town's last major employer, shuttered, leaving the

202
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:15,820
women who worked the plant little choice but to relocate or rely on unemployment programs.

203
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,540
In just a few decades, the bustling town, with boats whizzing past its wharves by day

204
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,860
and the poacher's lounge filling to standing room only by night, had taken on a melancholy

205
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,300
quiet.

206
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,160
As families peeled out of town one by one, the murmurs of whole-scale resettlement gained

207
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,060
momentum.

208
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,340
In Newfoundland and Labrador, the term resettlement is a loaded one.

209
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,580
I don't know, resettlement is a bad word for me, I mean, we did that back in Joey

210
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:50,220
Smalwell's day, and it was a terrible thing to do a brood of people that, you know, that

211
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,840
was there all their lives and didn't approve their one bit in the world.

212
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,300
In the wake of the cod collapse, the government revived the unpopular mid-century policy in

213
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,820
2010.

214
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,660
This time around, the resettlement program offered a proportionally larger payout, prohibited

215
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,240
the provincial government from initiating the process, and, if viable, required the

216
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,540
community to approve the decision by a 90% vote.

217
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:21,500
Still, more amenable terms aside, such a move was bound to hurt.

218
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,000
But I think the reason why it really strikes an emotional chord in Newfoundland and Labrador

219
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,140
is because it feels like the death of this way of life.

220
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,320
And so, you know, I felt that even when we sold my grandfather's home in Little Bay

221
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:43,920
East, on the southern shores of Newfoundland and Labrador, you know, here I had this physical

222
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:50,120
link to a community that my ancestry was tied up in for hundreds of years.

223
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,360
And then, you know, for that to be gone and to not be able to have that physical link

224
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,600
to a place that I remember growing up and, you know, going with my father to his childhood

225
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,280
home and beachcombing along the beach and being able to go out on a dory with my family

226
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,540
members, you know, to have that access pulled is more than, you know, let's do something

227
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,000
different next year, summer vacation.

228
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's this connection to place and culture and heritage and tradition.

229
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,200
And so I think that's difficult for people.

230
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,360
Opportunity created Little Bay Islands.

231
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,240
When Opportunity died, the town was bound to soon follow.

232
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,600
As the grand banks clogged with oversized trawlers and fishing transformed from a timeless

233
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:43,120
profession to one with an expiration date, Alport youth began to look west for Opportunity.

234
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Often this is what is happening.

235
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
There's no jobs.

236
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
Fun time.

237
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,200
And the fisher's gonna go, hey, it's summertime when you're out of school, you got a job

238
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
at a fish plant.

239
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Working in a fish plant or you went on a boat with your father or went down on a wharf

240
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,760
cutting out tongs, you may have lived, but now there's nothing for them to do.

241
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,880
Come out of school, there's no very few places to pick up a job in Newfoundland and

242
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,360
Labrador today.

243
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,480
In many cases, their own families urged them to move on.

244
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Absolutely.

245
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,780
I mean, my grandfather was the last fisherman in our family and that wasn't by accident,

246
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,780
that was by design.

247
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:18,600
You know, my grandfather and my grandmother wanted to make sure that their four boys had

248
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,720
an education and certainly Newfoundlanders and Labradorians are all educated, whether

249
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:29,260
that's on the land and sea or in a classroom, but they very much wanted their four boys

250
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,340
to receive a classroom education and to go on and have careers that allowed them to leave

251
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,380
the outboards.

252
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,560
As the hope that the fishery would soon recover faded, Little Bay Island's families and

253
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,640
youth made their way to the mainland, leaving behind an aging population deeply tied to

254
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:51,960
the landscape, but unmoored from economic opportunities and far from medical services.

255
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,720
With the processing plant shuttered, the school empty, the local bar dry, the fire department

256
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:03,640
closed, and the town doctor long gone, Little Bay Islands, in 2015, was a shell of its former

257
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
self.

258
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,120
For the 95 aging full-timers, 45 minutes away from medical facilities and grocery stores,

259
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,680
assuming fair weather, the time had arrived to put resettlement up for a vote.

260
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
The result?

261
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:26,240
85 votes for, 10 against—missing the required 90% benchmark by 0.53%.

262
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,200
Four years and zero miracles later, they voted again.

263
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:37,080
This time, it was unanimous—Little Bay Islands would resettle.

264
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,800
In the months following the vote, Little Bay Islanders soberly planned their next move,

265
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:47,320
packed their belongings, and, in some cases, converted their homes to operate off-grid,

266
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,880
anticipating summer visits.

267
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,880
In addition to the 250,000 Canadian dollars Little Bay Islanders were to receive for relocating,

268
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,840
they retained their property.

269
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,640
Gone, though, were the costly, government-supplied amenities.

270
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,360
No more power, no more snowplowing, and no more ferry service.

271
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,440
Those with unwavering bonds to the place where they grew up, where they raised families,

272
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,080
where they felt at home, would be back.

273
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,440
But it wouldn't be the same.

274
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,620
It couldn't be.

275
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:23,020
As the MV Hazel McIsaac disappeared into the December night, and the Parsons ducked back

276
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,840
into their newly off-grid home to ring in the new year, Little Bay Islands entered an

277
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,960
era both foreign and familiar.

278
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,320
However, were the centuries of permanent settlement, and decades of direct connection

279
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,640
to mainland Canada.

280
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,920
Returning, though, was the remoteness and self-sufficiency that defined the outport's

281
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,200
earliest days—a uniquely disconnected way of life that drew many to the islands in the

282
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,760
first place.

283
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,260
In recent years, seasonal visitors, sea kayakers, photographers, authors, and artists have descended

284
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,760
upon the striking landscapes and quaint coastal communities of the likes of Little Bay Islands.

285
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:06,120
And fishermen like Winfred Bartlett, and grandchildren of fishermen like Jen Thornhill-Verma, aren't

286
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,600
yet ready to agree to the devil's bargain that tourism presents.

287
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,840
In fact, my family still lives there.

288
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,220
As much as I'm proud that people go there to visit, I want people to go and stay for

289
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,720
a long time, not just a good time.

290
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,760
Staying for a long time, though, requires a healthy fishery.

291
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,520
A healthy fishery requires something that Newfoundland outport communities can't procure

292
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,720
on their own.

293
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:37,620
Future-forward, stringent, protective fishing policy at the national and international level.

294
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,120
Outports today, while built on a foundation of enterprising and independent spirit, bend

295
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,080
to global forces.

296
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,840
But then again, Little Bay Islands, and outports like it, have always been at the mercy of

297
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,680
economics and politics well beyond their wharves—spanning the Northern Atlantic and beyond.

298
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:02,280
It's likely too late for Little Bay Islands, but this doesn't have to be the end for

299
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
outports.

300
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,720
The lesson of Little Bay Islands is not that these places' rural, small-town lifestyle

301
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,260
can't exist—instead, it's that it can't exist in a vacuum.

302
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,480
While proudly independent and situated well on the periphery, the survival of these extremities

303
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,720
hinges on their relationships and ties to the center.

304
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,240
And while the people of outports get to decide when they resettle, it's much larger forces

305
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,040
that will decide if they have to.

306
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I really hope you enjoyed this video.

307
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,220
