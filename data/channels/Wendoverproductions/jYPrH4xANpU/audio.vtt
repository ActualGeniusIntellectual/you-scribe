00:09.620 --> 00:13.520
Private jets represent an inconceivable level of opulence.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.360
If the average American were to spend their entire year's salary to charter a Gulfstream

00:17.360 --> 00:22.500
G550 from New York, they would just barely make it to Utah, and yet, there's a class

00:22.500 --> 00:27.040
of people who use these planes to fly not just from New York to Utah, but rather routes

00:27.040 --> 00:28.660
like New York to Beijing.

00:28.660 --> 00:33.340
There's a class of people who will spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on

00:33.340 --> 00:35.260
just one single flight.

00:35.260 --> 00:40.020
Now, there are a few reasons this is strange beyond just the sheer price of things.

00:40.020 --> 00:43.420
Chartering that Gulfstream from London to Dubai, for example, you'd end up paying

00:43.420 --> 00:46.180
about $55,000 at rack rate.

00:46.180 --> 00:50.680
Meanwhile, if you were to fly Emirates' first class, which is just, if not more opulent,

00:50.680 --> 00:53.900
you could fly between the cities 20 times for the same price.

00:53.900 --> 00:57.980
What's even stranger about this kind of expense is that businesses, which are intended

00:57.980 --> 01:02.860
to maximize profits for their shareholders, are able to justify this enormous expense

01:02.860 --> 01:03.860
as worthwhile.

01:03.860 --> 01:09.580
So, when is it that paying $8,000 or more an hour to fly makes money?

01:09.580 --> 01:12.620
There's a pretty simple way of figuring this out.

01:12.620 --> 01:18.940
Out of the 8,760 hours in the year, the average CEO works 2,716 of them.

01:18.940 --> 01:25.740
For a CEO that's paid $1 million a year, that makes an hour of their time worth $368.

01:25.740 --> 01:30.680
Among America's largest companies, though, the average CEO earns $15.6 million.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.600
That makes their hour worth $5,750.

01:34.600 --> 01:38.820
For the most part, though, private jets fly about the same speed as commercial planes

01:38.820 --> 01:43.340
so when flying a route like London to Dubai, the time savings come at the airports on each

01:43.340 --> 01:44.340
end.

01:44.340 --> 01:48.620
It comes from being able to arrive, get on a plane, and fly, rather than having to navigate

01:48.620 --> 01:51.680
one's way through a busy terminal for a fixed flight time.

01:51.680 --> 01:56.120
But still, flying private versus commercial from London to Dubai would save, at most,

01:56.120 --> 01:58.320
about three hours in airport time.

01:58.320 --> 02:02.520
With the cost of $55,000 for the flight, that would mean the CEO's time would have to

02:02.520 --> 02:05.840
be worth $18,300 per hour.

02:05.840 --> 02:10.340
That wouldn't be true until they earned $50 million a year—a salary earned only

02:10.340 --> 02:12.540
by the upper echelon of CEOs.

02:12.540 --> 02:17.120
But the truth is that, for the most part, private jets do not make economic sense when

02:17.120 --> 02:21.680
flying routes with plenty of commercial service like London to Dubai.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.480
One of the larger corporate jet fleets out there belongs to Walmart.

02:25.480 --> 02:30.180
Now, this might come as a surprise considering that this is a company so focused on keeping

02:30.180 --> 02:31.180
costs low.

02:31.180 --> 02:37.320
You see, Walmart is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas—a relatively small city of 50,000.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.520
The airport does have a surprising amount of service for such a small city with flights

02:41.520 --> 02:46.080
all the way to Los Angeles and New York, largely propped up by the company's traffic, but

02:46.080 --> 02:48.920
for the higher ups, commercial doesn't cut it.

02:48.920 --> 02:54.120
That's why the company has a fleet of 20 corporate jets—the largest of any American

02:54.120 --> 02:55.280
company.

02:55.280 --> 02:59.240
These are most frequently flown by the company's regional vice president who are in charge

02:59.240 --> 03:03.240
of a specific area of the country and will have to make frequent store visits within

03:03.240 --> 03:04.320
this region.

03:04.320 --> 03:09.160
The company apparently has a goal that nobody spends a night away from Bentonville—they

03:09.160 --> 03:11.920
want as many trips as possible to be day trips.

03:11.960 --> 03:16.480
Now, let's say that one of these executive vice presidents needs to make a trip to three

03:16.480 --> 03:21.600
stores—one in Rock Springs, Wyoming, one in Spokane, Washington, and the last in Great

03:21.600 --> 03:23.360
Falls, Montana.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.180
Getting to Rock Springs requires a seven-hour itinerary through Denver that would get this

03:27.180 --> 03:31.840
executive in at 9.30pm therefore already requiring an overnight stop.

03:31.840 --> 03:36.080
Then, the next day, they would do their store visit in the morning and, as there are only

03:36.080 --> 03:40.600
two flights a day from Rock Springs, they would have to wait until 4.50pm to catch a

03:40.600 --> 03:45.980
flight back to Denver then another one to Spokane getting in at 8.30pm local time therefore

03:45.980 --> 03:48.500
requiring another overnight stop.

03:48.500 --> 03:52.240
The next morning they would do their site visit but once again, flight schedules dictate

03:52.240 --> 03:57.000
that the first itinerary to Great Falls would leave at 5.05pm through Salt Lake City getting

03:57.000 --> 04:02.120
in at 10.04pm local time thereby requiring another overnight stop.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.280
Following the next morning's store visit, this executive would catch a noon flight to

04:05.280 --> 04:11.780
Denver and, after a three-hour layover, another to finally get into Bentonville at 8.00pm.

04:11.780 --> 04:15.900
These three store visits would therefore take up to four whole working days but what if

04:15.900 --> 04:18.840
this executive flew private?

04:18.840 --> 04:23.320
Leaving at 9.00am, the first flight direct to Rock Springs would take an hour and 45

04:23.320 --> 04:28.000
minutes getting in, with the hours time change, at 9.45am local time.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
After a two-hour store visit, the plane would take off again at 11.45am flying an hour and

04:33.000 --> 04:36.660
15 minutes to Spokane getting in at noon local time.

04:36.660 --> 04:40.940
After another two-hour store visit, the plane would take off at 2.00pm for a quick 45 minute

04:40.940 --> 04:45.160
flight to Great Falls getting in at 3.45pm local time.

04:45.160 --> 04:50.200
After a final two hours at this store, the plane would take off its final time at 5.45pm

04:50.200 --> 04:51.200
bound for Bentonville.

04:51.200 --> 04:56.120
Two hours and 15 minutes of flight time later, it would land at 9.00pm local time, exactly

04:56.120 --> 04:57.980
12 hours after leaving.

04:57.980 --> 05:02.580
What was a four-day trip on commercial flights becomes a day trip on private and that's

05:02.580 --> 05:05.340
why Walmart decided private jets are worth it for them.

05:05.340 --> 05:09.500
It's all about valuing the time of their employees and they've determined that, even

05:09.500 --> 05:13.940
for the relatively low-level vice presidents, their time is valuable enough that it's

05:13.940 --> 05:15.940
worth flying them private.

05:15.940 --> 05:20.140
For example, one of the aircraft Walmart owns and operates is the Learjet 45.

05:20.140 --> 05:25.820
It cost the company about $4 per mile to operate this aircraft including crew, fuel, insurance,

05:25.820 --> 05:28.140
maintenance, and all other variable costs.

05:28.140 --> 05:32.420
Therefore, the 2,900 miles flown on that day trip to the northeast would cost them

05:32.420 --> 05:35.220
about $11,600.

05:35.220 --> 05:40.900
Saving three days, that places a value of $3,900 per day which means that, assuming

05:40.900 --> 05:45.780
the executive onboard works every single one of those 260 workdays per year, they would

05:45.780 --> 05:50.340
have to make almost exactly $1 million per year for this private jet ride to be worth

05:50.340 --> 05:54.960
it to Walmart—an amount within the realm of possibility for upper management at such

05:54.960 --> 05:56.400
a large company.

05:56.400 --> 06:00.420
Of course, that's not factoring in the alternative options hotel, food, and airline

06:00.420 --> 06:04.640
transport costs which would likely sum into the thousands and it's also assuming there's

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
just one passenger.

06:05.640 --> 06:10.300
If the plane were to be filled to its maximum capacity of nine, each passenger would only

06:10.300 --> 06:15.360
need to be paid $111,000 per year for the expense to be worth it to the company which

06:15.360 --> 06:18.200
is less than an average Walmart store manager makes.

06:18.200 --> 06:23.160
Now, there's one other case where private jets can make economic sense over flying commercial.

06:23.160 --> 06:26.740
Let's say Walmart was looking to expand into the Philippines.

06:26.740 --> 06:32.180
Flying business class, it would cost a minimum of $5,000 per person, require three stops,

06:32.180 --> 06:35.660
and take over 26 hours to get from Bentonville to Manila.

06:35.660 --> 06:40.700
Flying private, though, a long-range jet like the Bombardier Global 7500 could make it there

06:40.700 --> 06:45.880
non-stop in just 15 hours carrying 19 of the company's top executives.

06:45.880 --> 06:49.740
Since the company does not own this type of jet, it would likely charter one at a cost

06:49.740 --> 06:53.720
of about $10,000 an hour or $150,000 for the trip.

06:53.720 --> 06:58.860
While the cost of commercial airfare is less than this, assuming the CEO, who makes $24

06:58.860 --> 07:06.440
million a year, is on board, the value of the 11 hours of his time saved is worth $97,000—clearly

07:06.440 --> 07:08.980
tilting the math in favor of the private jet.

07:08.980 --> 07:13.580
The general phenomenon of globalization has been great for the private jet market as businesses

07:13.580 --> 07:18.200
need to travel to far off places like this, especially as companies outsource manufacturing

07:18.200 --> 07:22.740
and other operations into developing countries, which don't necessarily have much air service,

07:22.740 --> 07:26.540
many companies have determined that private jets are the best way to get where they need

07:26.540 --> 07:27.540
to go.

07:27.540 --> 07:32.860
But despite this, the private aviation industry was hit hard by the global financial crisis

07:32.860 --> 07:35.380
and still has not fully recovered.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.980
While part of it was genuine cost-cutting, businesses also wanted to show that they were

07:38.980 --> 07:43.200
doubling down on luxuries by getting rid of their jets even if they could make economic

07:43.200 --> 07:44.740
sense in some cases.

07:44.740 --> 07:50.360
It was all about optics and nowadays, these jets are coming with poorer and poorer optics

07:50.360 --> 07:51.960
for good reason.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.280
Private jets are truly horrendous for the environment.

07:55.280 --> 07:59.580
If one were to fly the Bombardier Global 7500, the one that could make it from Bentonville

07:59.580 --> 08:04.780
to Manila, with just one passenger on board, the jet would make it only to South Dakota

08:04.780 --> 08:09.360
before that passenger's carbon footprint exceeded that of the average person in one

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
year.

08:10.360 --> 08:15.580
Unfortunately, these jets are being used for purposes that cannot be justified economically.

08:15.580 --> 08:21.300
Since 2013, there has been about a 10% increase among Fortune 100 executives of using their

08:21.300 --> 08:24.800
company's corporate jets for personal, leisure purposes.

08:24.800 --> 08:28.980
They apparently justify this by saying that, in case of a work emergency, they might need

08:28.980 --> 08:33.080
to get back to the office quickly and commercial air service could hinder that.

08:33.080 --> 08:37.000
Firms that include this as a perk for their executives, according to one set of research,

08:37.000 --> 08:42.280
here perform against the market average in terms of shareholder returns by about 4% each

08:42.280 --> 08:43.320
year.

08:43.320 --> 08:47.280
Of course, the real reason some companies might have private jets is not because it

08:47.280 --> 08:50.560
makes economic sense because it quite often doesn't.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.760
It's because the people who decide whether the firm will use these are the very same

08:54.760 --> 08:56.720
people that will use them.

08:56.720 --> 09:01.720
In many instances, the explanation is not economic, it's societal.

09:01.720 --> 09:06.360
Now, many Wendover Productions viewers are also probably the type of person who watches

09:06.360 --> 09:07.560
a lot of documentaries.

09:07.560 --> 09:11.760
If that's you or if you'd like that to be you, you should absolutely be subscribed

09:11.760 --> 09:12.760
to CuriosityStream.

09:12.760 --> 09:17.600
That's because they have a library of over 2,400 documentaries and non-fiction titles

09:17.600 --> 09:19.480
that you can watch whenever, wherever.

09:19.480 --> 09:26.260
It's available on the web, Apple TV, Roku, Android, iOS, and plenty of other platforms.

09:26.260 --> 09:30.620
One series they have that I would highly recommend is Innovation Nation with Mo Rocca who looks

09:30.620 --> 09:34.560
at new inventions in each episode and explains the stories behind them.

09:34.560 --> 09:38.800
This and the entire rest of CuriosityStream's library can be accessed for just $2.99 per
