9620	13520	Private jets represent an inconceivable level of opulence.
13520	17360	If the average American were to spend their entire year's salary to charter a Gulfstream
17360	22500	G550 from New York, they would just barely make it to Utah, and yet, there's a class
22500	27040	of people who use these planes to fly not just from New York to Utah, but rather routes
27040	28660	like New York to Beijing.
28660	33340	There's a class of people who will spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on
33340	35260	just one single flight.
35260	40020	Now, there are a few reasons this is strange beyond just the sheer price of things.
40020	43420	Chartering that Gulfstream from London to Dubai, for example, you'd end up paying
43420	46180	about $55,000 at rack rate.
46180	50680	Meanwhile, if you were to fly Emirates' first class, which is just, if not more opulent,
50680	53900	you could fly between the cities 20 times for the same price.
53900	57980	What's even stranger about this kind of expense is that businesses, which are intended
57980	62860	to maximize profits for their shareholders, are able to justify this enormous expense
62860	63860	as worthwhile.
63860	69580	So, when is it that paying $8,000 or more an hour to fly makes money?
69580	72620	There's a pretty simple way of figuring this out.
72620	78940	Out of the 8,760 hours in the year, the average CEO works 2,716 of them.
78940	85740	For a CEO that's paid $1 million a year, that makes an hour of their time worth $368.
85740	90680	Among America's largest companies, though, the average CEO earns $15.6 million.
90680	94600	That makes their hour worth $5,750.
94600	98820	For the most part, though, private jets fly about the same speed as commercial planes
98820	103340	so when flying a route like London to Dubai, the time savings come at the airports on each
103340	104340	end.
104340	108620	It comes from being able to arrive, get on a plane, and fly, rather than having to navigate
108620	111680	one's way through a busy terminal for a fixed flight time.
111680	116120	But still, flying private versus commercial from London to Dubai would save, at most,
116120	118320	about three hours in airport time.
118320	122520	With the cost of $55,000 for the flight, that would mean the CEO's time would have to
122520	125840	be worth $18,300 per hour.
125840	130340	That wouldn't be true until they earned $50 million a year—a salary earned only
130340	132540	by the upper echelon of CEOs.
132540	137120	But the truth is that, for the most part, private jets do not make economic sense when
137120	141680	flying routes with plenty of commercial service like London to Dubai.
141680	145480	One of the larger corporate jet fleets out there belongs to Walmart.
145480	150180	Now, this might come as a surprise considering that this is a company so focused on keeping
150180	151180	costs low.
151180	157320	You see, Walmart is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas—a relatively small city of 50,000.
157320	161520	The airport does have a surprising amount of service for such a small city with flights
161520	166080	all the way to Los Angeles and New York, largely propped up by the company's traffic, but
166080	168920	for the higher ups, commercial doesn't cut it.
168920	174120	That's why the company has a fleet of 20 corporate jets—the largest of any American
174120	175280	company.
175280	179240	These are most frequently flown by the company's regional vice president who are in charge
179240	183240	of a specific area of the country and will have to make frequent store visits within
183240	184320	this region.
184320	189160	The company apparently has a goal that nobody spends a night away from Bentonville—they
189160	191920	want as many trips as possible to be day trips.
191960	196480	Now, let's say that one of these executive vice presidents needs to make a trip to three
196480	201600	stores—one in Rock Springs, Wyoming, one in Spokane, Washington, and the last in Great
201600	203360	Falls, Montana.
203360	207180	Getting to Rock Springs requires a seven-hour itinerary through Denver that would get this
207180	211840	executive in at 9.30pm therefore already requiring an overnight stop.
211840	216080	Then, the next day, they would do their store visit in the morning and, as there are only
216080	220600	two flights a day from Rock Springs, they would have to wait until 4.50pm to catch a
220600	225980	flight back to Denver then another one to Spokane getting in at 8.30pm local time therefore
225980	228500	requiring another overnight stop.
228500	232240	The next morning they would do their site visit but once again, flight schedules dictate
232240	237000	that the first itinerary to Great Falls would leave at 5.05pm through Salt Lake City getting
237000	242120	in at 10.04pm local time thereby requiring another overnight stop.
242120	245280	Following the next morning's store visit, this executive would catch a noon flight to
245280	251780	Denver and, after a three-hour layover, another to finally get into Bentonville at 8.00pm.
251780	255900	These three store visits would therefore take up to four whole working days but what if
255900	258840	this executive flew private?
258840	263320	Leaving at 9.00am, the first flight direct to Rock Springs would take an hour and 45
263320	268000	minutes getting in, with the hours time change, at 9.45am local time.
268000	273000	After a two-hour store visit, the plane would take off again at 11.45am flying an hour and
273000	276660	15 minutes to Spokane getting in at noon local time.
276660	280940	After another two-hour store visit, the plane would take off at 2.00pm for a quick 45 minute
280940	285160	flight to Great Falls getting in at 3.45pm local time.
285160	290200	After a final two hours at this store, the plane would take off its final time at 5.45pm
290200	291200	bound for Bentonville.
291200	296120	Two hours and 15 minutes of flight time later, it would land at 9.00pm local time, exactly
296120	297980	12 hours after leaving.
297980	302580	What was a four-day trip on commercial flights becomes a day trip on private and that's
302580	305340	why Walmart decided private jets are worth it for them.
305340	309500	It's all about valuing the time of their employees and they've determined that, even
309500	313940	for the relatively low-level vice presidents, their time is valuable enough that it's
313940	315940	worth flying them private.
315940	320140	For example, one of the aircraft Walmart owns and operates is the Learjet 45.
320140	325820	It cost the company about $4 per mile to operate this aircraft including crew, fuel, insurance,
325820	328140	maintenance, and all other variable costs.
328140	332420	Therefore, the 2,900 miles flown on that day trip to the northeast would cost them
332420	335220	about $11,600.
335220	340900	Saving three days, that places a value of $3,900 per day which means that, assuming
340900	345780	the executive onboard works every single one of those 260 workdays per year, they would
345780	350340	have to make almost exactly $1 million per year for this private jet ride to be worth
350340	354960	it to Walmart—an amount within the realm of possibility for upper management at such
354960	356400	a large company.
356400	360420	Of course, that's not factoring in the alternative options hotel, food, and airline
360420	364640	transport costs which would likely sum into the thousands and it's also assuming there's
364640	365640	just one passenger.
365640	370300	If the plane were to be filled to its maximum capacity of nine, each passenger would only
370300	375360	need to be paid $111,000 per year for the expense to be worth it to the company which
375360	378200	is less than an average Walmart store manager makes.
378200	383160	Now, there's one other case where private jets can make economic sense over flying commercial.
383160	386740	Let's say Walmart was looking to expand into the Philippines.
386740	392180	Flying business class, it would cost a minimum of $5,000 per person, require three stops,
392180	395660	and take over 26 hours to get from Bentonville to Manila.
395660	400700	Flying private, though, a long-range jet like the Bombardier Global 7500 could make it there
400700	405880	non-stop in just 15 hours carrying 19 of the company's top executives.
405880	409740	Since the company does not own this type of jet, it would likely charter one at a cost
409740	413720	of about $10,000 an hour or $150,000 for the trip.
413720	418860	While the cost of commercial airfare is less than this, assuming the CEO, who makes $24
418860	426440	million a year, is on board, the value of the 11 hours of his time saved is worth $97,000—clearly
426440	428980	tilting the math in favor of the private jet.
428980	433580	The general phenomenon of globalization has been great for the private jet market as businesses
433580	438200	need to travel to far off places like this, especially as companies outsource manufacturing
438200	442740	and other operations into developing countries, which don't necessarily have much air service,
442740	446540	many companies have determined that private jets are the best way to get where they need
446540	447540	to go.
447540	452860	But despite this, the private aviation industry was hit hard by the global financial crisis
452860	455380	and still has not fully recovered.
455380	458980	While part of it was genuine cost-cutting, businesses also wanted to show that they were
458980	463200	doubling down on luxuries by getting rid of their jets even if they could make economic
463200	464740	sense in some cases.
464740	470360	It was all about optics and nowadays, these jets are coming with poorer and poorer optics
470360	471960	for good reason.
471960	475280	Private jets are truly horrendous for the environment.
475280	479580	If one were to fly the Bombardier Global 7500, the one that could make it from Bentonville
479580	484780	to Manila, with just one passenger on board, the jet would make it only to South Dakota
484780	489360	before that passenger's carbon footprint exceeded that of the average person in one
489360	490360	year.
490360	495580	Unfortunately, these jets are being used for purposes that cannot be justified economically.
495580	501300	Since 2013, there has been about a 10% increase among Fortune 100 executives of using their
501300	504800	company's corporate jets for personal, leisure purposes.
504800	508980	They apparently justify this by saying that, in case of a work emergency, they might need
508980	513080	to get back to the office quickly and commercial air service could hinder that.
513080	517000	Firms that include this as a perk for their executives, according to one set of research,
517000	522280	here perform against the market average in terms of shareholder returns by about 4% each
522280	523320	year.
523320	527280	Of course, the real reason some companies might have private jets is not because it
527280	530560	makes economic sense because it quite often doesn't.
530560	534760	It's because the people who decide whether the firm will use these are the very same
534760	536720	people that will use them.
536720	541720	In many instances, the explanation is not economic, it's societal.
541720	546360	Now, many Wendover Productions viewers are also probably the type of person who watches
546360	547560	a lot of documentaries.
