3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:13,520
Private jets represent an inconceivable level of opulence.

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:17,360
If the average American were to spend their entire year's salary to charter a Gulfstream

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,500
G550 from New York, they would just barely make it to Utah, and yet, there's a class

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,040
of people who use these planes to fly not just from New York to Utah, but rather routes

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,660
like New York to Beijing.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,340
There's a class of people who will spend tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:35,260
just one single flight.

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,020
Now, there are a few reasons this is strange beyond just the sheer price of things.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,420
Chartering that Gulfstream from London to Dubai, for example, you'd end up paying

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,180
about $55,000 at rack rate.

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:50,680
Meanwhile, if you were to fly Emirates' first class, which is just, if not more opulent,

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,900
you could fly between the cities 20 times for the same price.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,980
What's even stranger about this kind of expense is that businesses, which are intended

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,860
to maximize profits for their shareholders, are able to justify this enormous expense

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,860
as worthwhile.

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:09,580
So, when is it that paying $8,000 or more an hour to fly makes money?

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,620
There's a pretty simple way of figuring this out.

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,940
Out of the 8,760 hours in the year, the average CEO works 2,716 of them.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:25,740
For a CEO that's paid $1 million a year, that makes an hour of their time worth $368.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,680
Among America's largest companies, though, the average CEO earns $15.6 million.

23
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,600
That makes their hour worth $5,750.

24
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,820
For the most part, though, private jets fly about the same speed as commercial planes

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,340
so when flying a route like London to Dubai, the time savings come at the airports on each

26
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,340
end.

27
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,620
It comes from being able to arrive, get on a plane, and fly, rather than having to navigate

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,680
one's way through a busy terminal for a fixed flight time.

29
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,120
But still, flying private versus commercial from London to Dubai would save, at most,

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,320
about three hours in airport time.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,520
With the cost of $55,000 for the flight, that would mean the CEO's time would have to

32
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,840
be worth $18,300 per hour.

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,340
That wouldn't be true until they earned $50 million a year—a salary earned only

34
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,540
by the upper echelon of CEOs.

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,120
But the truth is that, for the most part, private jets do not make economic sense when

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
flying routes with plenty of commercial service like London to Dubai.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,480
One of the larger corporate jet fleets out there belongs to Walmart.

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,180
Now, this might come as a surprise considering that this is a company so focused on keeping

39
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
costs low.

40
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,320
You see, Walmart is headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas—a relatively small city of 50,000.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,520
The airport does have a surprising amount of service for such a small city with flights

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,080
all the way to Los Angeles and New York, largely propped up by the company's traffic, but

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,920
for the higher ups, commercial doesn't cut it.

44
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,120
That's why the company has a fleet of 20 corporate jets—the largest of any American

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,280
company.

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,240
These are most frequently flown by the company's regional vice president who are in charge

47
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,240
of a specific area of the country and will have to make frequent store visits within

48
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,320
this region.

49
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,160
The company apparently has a goal that nobody spends a night away from Bentonville—they

50
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,920
want as many trips as possible to be day trips.

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Now, let's say that one of these executive vice presidents needs to make a trip to three

52
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,600
stores—one in Rock Springs, Wyoming, one in Spokane, Washington, and the last in Great

53
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,360
Falls, Montana.

54
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,180
Getting to Rock Springs requires a seven-hour itinerary through Denver that would get this

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,840
executive in at 9.30pm therefore already requiring an overnight stop.

56
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,080
Then, the next day, they would do their store visit in the morning and, as there are only

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,600
two flights a day from Rock Springs, they would have to wait until 4.50pm to catch a

58
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,980
flight back to Denver then another one to Spokane getting in at 8.30pm local time therefore

59
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,500
requiring another overnight stop.

60
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,240
The next morning they would do their site visit but once again, flight schedules dictate

61
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,000
that the first itinerary to Great Falls would leave at 5.05pm through Salt Lake City getting

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,120
in at 10.04pm local time thereby requiring another overnight stop.

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Following the next morning's store visit, this executive would catch a noon flight to

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,780
Denver and, after a three-hour layover, another to finally get into Bentonville at 8.00pm.

65
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,900
These three store visits would therefore take up to four whole working days but what if

66
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,840
this executive flew private?

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,320
Leaving at 9.00am, the first flight direct to Rock Springs would take an hour and 45

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,000
minutes getting in, with the hours time change, at 9.45am local time.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
After a two-hour store visit, the plane would take off again at 11.45am flying an hour and

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,660
15 minutes to Spokane getting in at noon local time.

71
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,940
After another two-hour store visit, the plane would take off at 2.00pm for a quick 45 minute

72
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,160
flight to Great Falls getting in at 3.45pm local time.

73
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,200
After a final two hours at this store, the plane would take off its final time at 5.45pm

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,200
bound for Bentonville.

75
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,120
Two hours and 15 minutes of flight time later, it would land at 9.00pm local time, exactly

76
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,980
12 hours after leaving.

77
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:02,580
What was a four-day trip on commercial flights becomes a day trip on private and that's

78
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,340
why Walmart decided private jets are worth it for them.

79
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,500
It's all about valuing the time of their employees and they've determined that, even

80
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,940
for the relatively low-level vice presidents, their time is valuable enough that it's

81
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,940
worth flying them private.

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,140
For example, one of the aircraft Walmart owns and operates is the Learjet 45.

83
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,820
It cost the company about $4 per mile to operate this aircraft including crew, fuel, insurance,

84
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,140
maintenance, and all other variable costs.

85
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,420
Therefore, the 2,900 miles flown on that day trip to the northeast would cost them

86
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,220
about $11,600.

87
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,900
Saving three days, that places a value of $3,900 per day which means that, assuming

88
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,780
the executive onboard works every single one of those 260 workdays per year, they would

89
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,340
have to make almost exactly $1 million per year for this private jet ride to be worth

90
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,960
it to Walmart—an amount within the realm of possibility for upper management at such

91
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
a large company.

92
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,420
Of course, that's not factoring in the alternative options hotel, food, and airline

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,640
transport costs which would likely sum into the thousands and it's also assuming there's

94
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
just one passenger.

95
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,300
If the plane were to be filled to its maximum capacity of nine, each passenger would only

96
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,360
need to be paid $111,000 per year for the expense to be worth it to the company which

97
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,200
is less than an average Walmart store manager makes.

98
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,160
Now, there's one other case where private jets can make economic sense over flying commercial.

99
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,740
Let's say Walmart was looking to expand into the Philippines.

100
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,180
Flying business class, it would cost a minimum of $5,000 per person, require three stops,

101
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,660
and take over 26 hours to get from Bentonville to Manila.

102
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,700
Flying private, though, a long-range jet like the Bombardier Global 7500 could make it there

103
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,880
non-stop in just 15 hours carrying 19 of the company's top executives.

104
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,740
Since the company does not own this type of jet, it would likely charter one at a cost

105
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,720
of about $10,000 an hour or $150,000 for the trip.

106
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,860
While the cost of commercial airfare is less than this, assuming the CEO, who makes $24

107
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,440
million a year, is on board, the value of the 11 hours of his time saved is worth $97,000—clearly

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,980
tilting the math in favor of the private jet.

109
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:13,580
The general phenomenon of globalization has been great for the private jet market as businesses

110
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,200
need to travel to far off places like this, especially as companies outsource manufacturing

111
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,740
and other operations into developing countries, which don't necessarily have much air service,

112
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,540
many companies have determined that private jets are the best way to get where they need

113
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
to go.

114
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,860
But despite this, the private aviation industry was hit hard by the global financial crisis

115
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,380
and still has not fully recovered.

116
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,980
While part of it was genuine cost-cutting, businesses also wanted to show that they were

117
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,200
doubling down on luxuries by getting rid of their jets even if they could make economic

118
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,740
sense in some cases.

119
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,360
It was all about optics and nowadays, these jets are coming with poorer and poorer optics

120
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,960
for good reason.

121
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,280
Private jets are truly horrendous for the environment.

122
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,580
If one were to fly the Bombardier Global 7500, the one that could make it from Bentonville

123
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,780
to Manila, with just one passenger on board, the jet would make it only to South Dakota

124
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,360
before that passenger's carbon footprint exceeded that of the average person in one

125
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
year.

126
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,580
Unfortunately, these jets are being used for purposes that cannot be justified economically.

127
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:21,300
Since 2013, there has been about a 10% increase among Fortune 100 executives of using their

128
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,800
company's corporate jets for personal, leisure purposes.

129
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,980
They apparently justify this by saying that, in case of a work emergency, they might need

130
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,080
to get back to the office quickly and commercial air service could hinder that.

131
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,000
Firms that include this as a perk for their executives, according to one set of research,

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,280
here perform against the market average in terms of shareholder returns by about 4% each

133
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,320
year.

134
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,280
Of course, the real reason some companies might have private jets is not because it

135
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,560
makes economic sense because it quite often doesn't.

136
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,760
It's because the people who decide whether the firm will use these are the very same

137
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
people that will use them.

138
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,720
In many instances, the explanation is not economic, it's societal.

139
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,360
Now, many Wendover Productions viewers are also probably the type of person who watches

140
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,560
a lot of documentaries.

141
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,760
If that's you or if you'd like that to be you, you should absolutely be subscribed

142
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
to CuriosityStream.

143
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,600
That's because they have a library of over 2,400 documentaries and non-fiction titles

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,480
that you can watch whenever, wherever.

145
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,260
It's available on the web, Apple TV, Roku, Android, iOS, and plenty of other platforms.

146
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:30,620
One series they have that I would highly recommend is Innovation Nation with Mo Rocca who looks

147
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,560
at new inventions in each episode and explains the stories behind them.
