0	3760	This is Every Country in the World Part 2 by Wendover Productions.
3760	7400	If you haven't seen part one, click here to watch that first.
7400	10800	We left off last time in Suriname, our 98th country.
10800	14680	Suriname is the only country other than the Netherlands whose sole primary language is
14680	19040	Dutch although there are other countries that speak a creole version of Dutch like Namibia,
19040	22680	which speaks Afrikaans which is just close enough to Dutch that a Dutch and Namibian
22680	24080	could hold a conversation.
24080	28000	Namibia has this long protrusion which gives them access to the Zambezi river although
28000	32160	they miss out by about 300 feet on bordering Zimbabwe which is the country ferries have
32160	36160	to pass through when making the 600 foot trip from Botswana to Zambia.
36160	39760	This is likely the shortest ferry in the world to cross through three countries.
39760	45080	To the northeast of Zambia is one of the world's 176 tri-points—triple border crossings.
45080	49240	This one links Zambia to Malawi and Tanzania whose northern border is a very straight line
49240	52720	across Lake Victoria which creates these two tiny cut-off peninsulas.
52720	56640	Uganda is a surprisingly progressive nation with the highest representation of women in
56640	59400	parliament in the world at 63%.
59400	64480	They also became the first country in the world to outright ban plastic bags in 2007.
64480	70120	The Solomon Islands, on the other hand, only has one women in their parliament or 2% representation.
70120	74280	The Solomon Islands is home to the West Georgia Islands which share a name with Georgia which
74280	78080	kind of shares a name with Georgia's Plain in Jamaica which is one of two countries in
78080	82800	the world whose flag doesn't share colors with the American flag as in no red, white,
82800	83800	or blue.
83800	87280	The other one is Mauritania, but Libya used to be on that list until they changed their
87280	89960	flag from this to this in 2011.
89960	94680	Libya is so large that its northwest point is closer to Luxembourg than to its southeast
94680	95680	point.
95680	99680	Luxembourg has the second highest per capita income in the world behind Qatar, a small
99680	103880	but mighty country that's just a bit larger than Lebanon who shares a southern border
103880	108140	with a United Nations Disengagement Observer Force zone which is an area essentially without
108140	112920	sovereignty meant to serve as a buffer between Israeli controlled Syria and Syria.
112920	117600	One could call it a demilitarized zone, although the most famous DMZ is north of South Korea
117600	120920	where if you dig a hole straight down and through the earth you'd pop up just off
120920	122360	the coast of Uruguay.
122360	127920	Uruguay was a military dictatorship up until 1985 but Thailand still is, the only current
127920	128920	one.
128920	133640	Bangkok, Thailand is the most visited city in the world at 16 million yearly visitors
133640	139180	which is a ton especially compared to Vilnius, Lithuania which only sees 180,000 visitors
139180	140180	per year.
140180	143460	Romania has a rather straight border through this lake which leads to two peninsulas with
143460	147500	their tops chopped off and an internationally divided islands with Belarus which has a rather
147500	151100	straight border in this lake which leads to another peninsula with its top chopped off
151100	153420	and an internationally divided island with Latvia.
153420	157980	Latvia's independence day is May the 4th, aka Star Wars day, whose scenes on Tatooine
157980	159660	were filmed in Tunisia.
159660	164240	Tunisia's currency is the dinar which is also the name for the currency in Macedonia.
164240	168340	If you look at Macedonia on a map, it will almost always have FYROM under its name which
168340	171040	stands for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
171040	174560	When Macedonia became an independent country, it picked this name, but Greece wasn't all
174560	179000	too happy about it since their northern region is also called Macedonia so the solution was
179000	183460	to call the country the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in all official capacities while
183460	186400	colloquially it's still known as Macedonia.
186400	190960	Greece is known for having a huge expatriated population around the world and the 39th largest
190960	194400	Greek population in the world is in Oman in the middle east.
194400	198860	Inside Oman is an exclave of the United Arab Emirates, except this part of Oman is actually
198860	204140	an enclave inside the UAE which makes this the only double enclave in the middle east.
204140	208580	The UAE is one of 18 countries worldwide to not have a river, one of which is Tonga which
208580	212840	actually has an Olympic medal from their super heavyweight boxer Paya Wolfgram.
212840	216620	Another country that has one total medal is Gabon whose southern border is shared with
216620	220780	Congo whose southern border is shared with this rather large exclave of Angola.
220800	224960	Only because of that exclave, Angola borders both Congo and the Democratic Republic of
224960	225960	the Congo.
225960	229040	These are of course two different countries, although they're both named for the Congo
229040	234040	River—the deepest river in the world at more than 750 feet deep.
234040	237920	Interestingly, despite being both enormous countries, their current capitals are just
237920	240100	on opposite sides of the Congo from each other.
240100	245120	The DRC has this great clean border with Rwanda which causes no problems at all, unlike this
245120	246400	one in Austria.
246400	250900	Jungholz is only connected to the rest of Austria by about 15 feet of territory and
250900	251900	no roads.
251900	256180	Vienna, Austria used to be the capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire whose territory
256180	260820	included present day Italy, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia, all of which
260820	264940	we've already talked about, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Hungary,
264940	267240	Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine.
267240	270820	Ukraine has this southern section which isn't part of Russia yet, although it's only connected
270820	274980	to the rest of Ukraine by two roads, one of which rather inconveniently passes through
274980	277520	Moldova for only about three miles.
277520	281560	Moldova is rated the third least touristy country in the world since only one tourist
281560	287520	visits each year for every 323 citizens, although Bangladesh is the number one least touristy
287520	293760	country since for each yearly tourist visit there are 1,273 Bangladeshi citizens.
293760	299240	Bahrain, on the other hand, receives 7.7 tourist visits per citizen per year and also has an
299240	302800	internationally divided island, but this one was actually very purposefully created to
302800	307100	serve as a passport control point between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia on the King Fahd
307100	308100	Khaswe.
308100	312340	Saudi Arabia is home to Mecca, the birthplace of the central figure of Islam, the prophet
312340	313340	Muhammad.
313340	317360	Mecca has a population of about 1.5 million but during the Hajj, the yearly pilgrimage
317360	321540	to Mecca, this triples to almost 5 million people.
321540	326760	Land in Mecca is some of the most expensive in the world at up to $13,000 per square foot.
326760	330740	Saudi Arabia really isn't great friends with their southern neighbor, Yemen, who owns
330740	335280	over 200 islands including Sakuchir Island which is surprisingly green compared to its
335280	339720	mainland neighbors and is the only place in the world where you can find the dragon's
339720	340720	blood tree.
340720	344680	Yemen's national soccer team has played Bhutan three times in the last few decades,
344680	347000	all of which Bhutan lost rather horribly.
347000	350980	Bhutan is home to the Gengar Puenza Mountain which is believed to be the tallest, unsummited
350980	355560	mountain in the world since local spiritual beliefs prohibit anyone from climbing a mountain
355560	357700	over 6,000 meters.
357700	361700	This mountain is in the Himalayas Range which if you follow to the west brings you to Nepal
361700	365360	which is of course home to Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world.
365360	372120	Everest is 29,029 feet tall—880 times higher than the Marshall Islands tallest peak at
372120	373120	33 feet.
373120	376320	If you dig a hole straight down through the earth from the Marshall Islands you arrive
376320	381080	just off the coast from Liberia which is the country of registration of 11% of the world's
381080	382080	ships.
382080	389180	With 1,771 registered ships, though, only 190 are actually owned by Liberians.
389180	393220	Foreigners register their ships there since there are few regulations and low costs.
393220	399540	Malta also registers many ships for the same reason with 1,437 foreign owned ships.
399540	403500	Malta is a European Union member which means that we've almost talked about every EU
403500	404500	member.
404500	409220	Our last two are Estonia and Ireland whose northernmost point is actually farther north
409220	410740	than Northern Ireland's.
410740	415600	Ireland has played Samoa six times in rugby and Samoa actually won once which is quite
415600	418160	impressive for a country of less than 200,000.
418160	423480	Samoa's rugby team did once lose to New Zealand 101-14 though so they're not that
423480	424480	good.
424480	426240	New Zealand has a kind of territory of Nui.
426240	431020	It's recognized as a freely associated state, meaning by choice, but Nui isn't recognized
431020	433400	by the UN as an independent country.
433400	438080	However, Nui is exactly on the opposite side of the world from Niger which is named for
438080	439080	the Niger River.
439100	442820	The Niger River has probably the most bizarre river course in the world.
442820	448180	It starts only 150 miles from the Atlantic Ocean but then takes a 2,600 mile path to
448180	449300	reach the ocean.
449300	455240	It starts in Sierra Leone, flows through Guinea, Mali, Niger itself, then Benin before reaching
455240	456660	the ocean in Nigeria.
456660	461480	Nigeria is also named after the Niger River and is by far the most populous country in
461480	464800	Africa at 125 million people.
464800	468780	The least populous country in Africa is the Seychelles which isn't on the mainland but
468800	470980	is still considered an African country.
470980	476120	They also have what might be the coolest flag in the world, except for maybe St. Lucia's,
476120	480080	but I do have to give a solid runners up position to St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
480080	484000	St. Vincent and the Grenadines name is rather purposefully similar to that of its neighboring
484000	485000	island, Grenada.
485000	490080	Grenada's airport wasn't built until 1985, but nowadays you can fly to places like Port
490080	492000	of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago.
492000	496640	Trinidad is also the name of a municipality of 20,000 people in Honduras which has two
496640	499840	capitals—Tagusa Galpa and Coma Yaguya.
499840	504140	Much like the Cote d'Ivoire, whose capitals are Yamasucro and Abadjan, despite having
504140	508860	a very easy English translation—the Ivory Coast—the Cote d'Ivoire is almost always
508860	513400	referred to by this name since its government refuses to accept any translated name.
513400	516540	If you draw a straight line south from Cote d'Ivoire until it crosses Antarctica and
516540	520960	goes north, you'll end up intersecting Vanuatu which is one of seven countries worldwide
520960	526120	to not be part of the International Criminal Police Organization, also known as Interpol.
526120	529900	Another non-Interpol member country is Tuvalu which is the second smallest country in the
529900	532580	world to have a commercial international airport.
532580	536740	This is also the second video in a row that I've used this image—watch my last video
536740	538540	to find out why.
538540	542340	Nauru is the smallest country outright to have an airport and it rather controversially
542340	547260	has camps for those who attempt to seek asylum in Australia, many of whom are from Iraq.
547260	552540	Iraq borders Iran which has 22 ski resorts that's more than the entire South American
552540	553540	continent.
553560	557320	Speaking of South America, we haven't covered Paraguay which is another one of these landlocked
557320	562040	countries with a navy and with that, we've touched on every South American country.
562040	565680	If you dig a hole through the earth from Paraguay, you end up just north of Philippines which
565680	568400	is our seventh to last Asian country.
568400	571520	The other ones are Myanmar which is one of the world's three countries not using the
571520	576620	metric system, Timor-Leste whose currency is the US dollar despite having no real connections
576620	581360	to the US, Pakistan which is home to the third largest non-polar glacier in the world despite
581360	585660	being at the same latitude of South Texas, Jordan which you may think is landlocked from
585660	590140	looking at a map but actually has a 16 mile coast on the Red Sea, Syria which is home
590140	594980	to Damascus, the oldest continuously inhabited city on the planet, and Kuwait which has the
594980	600100	highest value currency in the world at $3.3 US dollars to each Kuwaiti dinar.
600100	603400	With that, we've covered every Asian country.
603400	607260	One of the lowest value currencies in the world is the Sautomé and Príncipe Dobra
607260	609820	at $23,000 to the dollar.
609820	614600	Sautomé and Príncipe speaks Portuguese which means we've covered every Portuguese-speaking
614600	615600	country.
615600	618920	The country is also off the coast of Cameroon which became the first African country to
618920	623600	reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in 1990 although that's since been accomplished
623600	628640	by Ghana where the official and primary language is English and there are only three more countries
628640	629640	like this.
629640	633780	Belize, the only English-speaking country in Central America, Barbados, who has the
633780	637900	third highest human development index score in the western hemisphere, and Antigua and
637900	643720	Barbuda whose native language, Taino, is the origin of English words like canoe, barbeque,
643720	644720	hammock, and hurricane.
644720	648680	So, we've covered every English-speaking country but there are two remaining countries
648680	653320	that were part of the British Empire—Dominica where Antillean Creole is the primary language
653320	658160	and Mauritius which has the highest population density in Africa at over 1,500 people per
658160	659160	square mile.
659160	662840	One of the lowest population densities in Africa is in the Central African Republic
662840	664880	at 18 people per square mile.
664880	668780	The Central African Republic's northern neighbor is Chad whose embassy in Washington
668780	674860	DC is only 200 feet away from that of Burkina Faso whose capital has perhaps the best name
674860	676800	in the world—Quagadougou.
676800	680580	In the southeast of Burkina Faso is this piece of togo that is only connected to the main
680580	683300	part by a 300 foot wide strip of land.
683300	687580	This area's roads, however, all come from Burkina Faso which means that, much like Point
687580	692260	Roberts, residents need to cross two international borders to get to their own country.
692260	694700	There are only three African countries left.
694700	698840	Comoros, the second largest vanilla producer in the world, Burundi, the poorest country
698840	703400	in the world to have an Olympic medal, and Eritrea which has neither an official or majority
703400	704640	spoken language.
704640	708520	Drawing a latitude line west from Eritrea brings you to Nicaragua, home to a lake on
708520	710000	an island in a lake.
710000	714660	More than 100,000 Nicaraguans live in nearby El Salvador which is the smallest Central
714660	718040	American country and the only one not to have a Caribbean coastline.
718040	721980	El Salvador's northern neighbor is Guatemala whose border with Mexico was originally defined
721980	726000	by the course of the Chixoy River but erosion has changed the course which created a bunch
726000	728800	of enclaves and exclaves like this, this, and this.
728800	732040	And that's our last country in the western hemisphere, we're getting close.
732040	735720	Guatemala's embassy in Ottawa is about 900 feet away from Slovenia's which has this
735720	740240	really messed up border with Croatia including this tiny section which isn't actually claimed
740240	742960	by either country making it Terra Nulis.
742960	748800	The tenth and final country to end in NIA and our final country is Albania whose capital
748800	751600	is one of the only in Europe to not have a McDonald's.
751600	755380	But wait, if you draw a latitude line from the south of Albania that brings you to the
755380	760460	north of Afghanistan where Albania sent 44 troops to fight in 2005 and that's where
760460	764420	we started this video so if you're feeling like a second round, click here to start again.
764420	766700	I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.
