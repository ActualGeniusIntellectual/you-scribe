00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
This is Every Country in the World Part 2 by Wendover Productions.

00:03.760 --> 00:07.400
If you haven't seen part one, click here to watch that first.

00:07.400 --> 00:10.800
We left off last time in Suriname, our 98th country.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.680
Suriname is the only country other than the Netherlands whose sole primary language is

00:14.680 --> 00:19.040
Dutch although there are other countries that speak a creole version of Dutch like Namibia,

00:19.040 --> 00:22.680
which speaks Afrikaans which is just close enough to Dutch that a Dutch and Namibian

00:22.680 --> 00:24.080
could hold a conversation.

00:24.080 --> 00:28.000
Namibia has this long protrusion which gives them access to the Zambezi river although

00:28.000 --> 00:32.160
they miss out by about 300 feet on bordering Zimbabwe which is the country ferries have

00:32.160 --> 00:36.160
to pass through when making the 600 foot trip from Botswana to Zambia.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.760
This is likely the shortest ferry in the world to cross through three countries.

00:39.760 --> 00:45.080
To the northeast of Zambia is one of the world's 176 tri-points—triple border crossings.

00:45.080 --> 00:49.240
This one links Zambia to Malawi and Tanzania whose northern border is a very straight line

00:49.240 --> 00:52.720
across Lake Victoria which creates these two tiny cut-off peninsulas.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.640
Uganda is a surprisingly progressive nation with the highest representation of women in

00:56.640 --> 00:59.400
parliament in the world at 63%.

00:59.400 --> 01:04.480
They also became the first country in the world to outright ban plastic bags in 2007.

01:04.480 --> 01:10.120
The Solomon Islands, on the other hand, only has one women in their parliament or 2% representation.

01:10.120 --> 01:14.280
The Solomon Islands is home to the West Georgia Islands which share a name with Georgia which

01:14.280 --> 01:18.080
kind of shares a name with Georgia's Plain in Jamaica which is one of two countries in

01:18.080 --> 01:22.800
the world whose flag doesn't share colors with the American flag as in no red, white,

01:22.800 --> 01:23.800
or blue.

01:23.800 --> 01:27.280
The other one is Mauritania, but Libya used to be on that list until they changed their

01:27.280 --> 01:29.960
flag from this to this in 2011.

01:29.960 --> 01:34.680
Libya is so large that its northwest point is closer to Luxembourg than to its southeast

01:34.680 --> 01:35.680
point.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.680
Luxembourg has the second highest per capita income in the world behind Qatar, a small

01:39.680 --> 01:43.880
but mighty country that's just a bit larger than Lebanon who shares a southern border

01:43.880 --> 01:48.140
with a United Nations Disengagement Observer Force zone which is an area essentially without

01:48.140 --> 01:52.920
sovereignty meant to serve as a buffer between Israeli controlled Syria and Syria.

01:52.920 --> 01:57.600
One could call it a demilitarized zone, although the most famous DMZ is north of South Korea

01:57.600 --> 02:00.920
where if you dig a hole straight down and through the earth you'd pop up just off

02:00.920 --> 02:02.360
the coast of Uruguay.

02:02.360 --> 02:07.920
Uruguay was a military dictatorship up until 1985 but Thailand still is, the only current

02:07.920 --> 02:08.920
one.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.640
Bangkok, Thailand is the most visited city in the world at 16 million yearly visitors

02:13.640 --> 02:19.180
which is a ton especially compared to Vilnius, Lithuania which only sees 180,000 visitors

02:19.180 --> 02:20.180
per year.

02:20.180 --> 02:23.460
Romania has a rather straight border through this lake which leads to two peninsulas with

02:23.460 --> 02:27.500
their tops chopped off and an internationally divided islands with Belarus which has a rather

02:27.500 --> 02:31.100
straight border in this lake which leads to another peninsula with its top chopped off

02:31.100 --> 02:33.420
and an internationally divided island with Latvia.

02:33.420 --> 02:37.980
Latvia's independence day is May the 4th, aka Star Wars day, whose scenes on Tatooine

02:37.980 --> 02:39.660
were filmed in Tunisia.

02:39.660 --> 02:44.240
Tunisia's currency is the dinar which is also the name for the currency in Macedonia.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.340
If you look at Macedonia on a map, it will almost always have FYROM under its name which

02:48.340 --> 02:51.040
stands for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.560
When Macedonia became an independent country, it picked this name, but Greece wasn't all

02:54.560 --> 02:59.000
too happy about it since their northern region is also called Macedonia so the solution was

02:59.000 --> 03:03.460
to call the country the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in all official capacities while

03:03.460 --> 03:06.400
colloquially it's still known as Macedonia.

03:06.400 --> 03:10.960
Greece is known for having a huge expatriated population around the world and the 39th largest

03:10.960 --> 03:14.400
Greek population in the world is in Oman in the middle east.

03:14.400 --> 03:18.860
Inside Oman is an exclave of the United Arab Emirates, except this part of Oman is actually

03:18.860 --> 03:24.140
an enclave inside the UAE which makes this the only double enclave in the middle east.

03:24.140 --> 03:28.580
The UAE is one of 18 countries worldwide to not have a river, one of which is Tonga which

03:28.580 --> 03:32.840
actually has an Olympic medal from their super heavyweight boxer Paya Wolfgram.

03:32.840 --> 03:36.620
Another country that has one total medal is Gabon whose southern border is shared with

03:36.620 --> 03:40.780
Congo whose southern border is shared with this rather large exclave of Angola.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.960
Only because of that exclave, Angola borders both Congo and the Democratic Republic of

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
the Congo.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.040
These are of course two different countries, although they're both named for the Congo

03:49.040 --> 03:54.040
River—the deepest river in the world at more than 750 feet deep.

03:54.040 --> 03:57.920
Interestingly, despite being both enormous countries, their current capitals are just

03:57.920 --> 04:00.100
on opposite sides of the Congo from each other.

04:00.100 --> 04:05.120
The DRC has this great clean border with Rwanda which causes no problems at all, unlike this

04:05.120 --> 04:06.400
one in Austria.

04:06.400 --> 04:10.900
Jungholz is only connected to the rest of Austria by about 15 feet of territory and

04:10.900 --> 04:11.900
no roads.

04:11.900 --> 04:16.180
Vienna, Austria used to be the capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire whose territory

04:16.180 --> 04:20.820
included present day Italy, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia, all of which

04:20.820 --> 04:24.940
we've already talked about, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Hungary,

04:24.940 --> 04:27.240
Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

04:27.240 --> 04:30.820
Ukraine has this southern section which isn't part of Russia yet, although it's only connected

04:30.820 --> 04:34.980
to the rest of Ukraine by two roads, one of which rather inconveniently passes through

04:34.980 --> 04:37.520
Moldova for only about three miles.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.560
Moldova is rated the third least touristy country in the world since only one tourist

04:41.560 --> 04:47.520
visits each year for every 323 citizens, although Bangladesh is the number one least touristy

04:47.520 --> 04:53.760
country since for each yearly tourist visit there are 1,273 Bangladeshi citizens.

04:53.760 --> 04:59.240
Bahrain, on the other hand, receives 7.7 tourist visits per citizen per year and also has an

04:59.240 --> 05:02.800
internationally divided island, but this one was actually very purposefully created to

05:02.800 --> 05:07.100
serve as a passport control point between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia on the King Fahd

05:07.100 --> 05:08.100
Khaswe.

05:08.100 --> 05:12.340
Saudi Arabia is home to Mecca, the birthplace of the central figure of Islam, the prophet

05:12.340 --> 05:13.340
Muhammad.

05:13.340 --> 05:17.360
Mecca has a population of about 1.5 million but during the Hajj, the yearly pilgrimage

05:17.360 --> 05:21.540
to Mecca, this triples to almost 5 million people.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.760
Land in Mecca is some of the most expensive in the world at up to $13,000 per square foot.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.740
Saudi Arabia really isn't great friends with their southern neighbor, Yemen, who owns

05:30.740 --> 05:35.280
over 200 islands including Sakuchir Island which is surprisingly green compared to its

05:35.280 --> 05:39.720
mainland neighbors and is the only place in the world where you can find the dragon's

05:39.720 --> 05:40.720
blood tree.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.680
Yemen's national soccer team has played Bhutan three times in the last few decades,

05:44.680 --> 05:47.000
all of which Bhutan lost rather horribly.

05:47.000 --> 05:50.980
Bhutan is home to the Gengar Puenza Mountain which is believed to be the tallest, unsummited

05:50.980 --> 05:55.560
mountain in the world since local spiritual beliefs prohibit anyone from climbing a mountain

05:55.560 --> 05:57.700
over 6,000 meters.

05:57.700 --> 06:01.700
This mountain is in the Himalayas Range which if you follow to the west brings you to Nepal

06:01.700 --> 06:05.360
which is of course home to Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world.

06:05.360 --> 06:12.120
Everest is 29,029 feet tall—880 times higher than the Marshall Islands tallest peak at

06:12.120 --> 06:13.120
33 feet.

06:13.120 --> 06:16.320
If you dig a hole straight down through the earth from the Marshall Islands you arrive

06:16.320 --> 06:21.080
just off the coast from Liberia which is the country of registration of 11% of the world's

06:21.080 --> 06:22.080
ships.

06:22.080 --> 06:29.180
With 1,771 registered ships, though, only 190 are actually owned by Liberians.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.220
Foreigners register their ships there since there are few regulations and low costs.

06:33.220 --> 06:39.540
Malta also registers many ships for the same reason with 1,437 foreign owned ships.

06:39.540 --> 06:43.500
Malta is a European Union member which means that we've almost talked about every EU

06:43.500 --> 06:44.500
member.

06:44.500 --> 06:49.220
Our last two are Estonia and Ireland whose northernmost point is actually farther north

06:49.220 --> 06:50.740
than Northern Ireland's.

06:50.740 --> 06:55.600
Ireland has played Samoa six times in rugby and Samoa actually won once which is quite

06:55.600 --> 06:58.160
impressive for a country of less than 200,000.

06:58.160 --> 07:03.480
Samoa's rugby team did once lose to New Zealand 101-14 though so they're not that

07:03.480 --> 07:04.480
good.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.240
New Zealand has a kind of territory of Nui.

07:06.240 --> 07:11.020
It's recognized as a freely associated state, meaning by choice, but Nui isn't recognized

07:11.020 --> 07:13.400
by the UN as an independent country.

07:13.400 --> 07:18.080
However, Nui is exactly on the opposite side of the world from Niger which is named for

07:18.080 --> 07:19.080
the Niger River.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.820
The Niger River has probably the most bizarre river course in the world.

07:22.820 --> 07:28.180
It starts only 150 miles from the Atlantic Ocean but then takes a 2,600 mile path to

07:28.180 --> 07:29.300
reach the ocean.

07:29.300 --> 07:35.240
It starts in Sierra Leone, flows through Guinea, Mali, Niger itself, then Benin before reaching

07:35.240 --> 07:36.660
the ocean in Nigeria.

07:36.660 --> 07:41.480
Nigeria is also named after the Niger River and is by far the most populous country in

07:41.480 --> 07:44.800
Africa at 125 million people.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.780
The least populous country in Africa is the Seychelles which isn't on the mainland but

07:48.800 --> 07:50.980
is still considered an African country.

07:50.980 --> 07:56.120
They also have what might be the coolest flag in the world, except for maybe St. Lucia's,

07:56.120 --> 08:00.080
but I do have to give a solid runners up position to St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

08:00.080 --> 08:04.000
St. Vincent and the Grenadines name is rather purposefully similar to that of its neighboring

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
island, Grenada.

08:05.000 --> 08:10.080
Grenada's airport wasn't built until 1985, but nowadays you can fly to places like Port

08:10.080 --> 08:12.000
of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.640
Trinidad is also the name of a municipality of 20,000 people in Honduras which has two

08:16.640 --> 08:19.840
capitals—Tagusa Galpa and Coma Yaguya.

08:19.840 --> 08:24.140
Much like the Cote d'Ivoire, whose capitals are Yamasucro and Abadjan, despite having

08:24.140 --> 08:28.860
a very easy English translation—the Ivory Coast—the Cote d'Ivoire is almost always

08:28.860 --> 08:33.400
referred to by this name since its government refuses to accept any translated name.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.540
If you draw a straight line south from Cote d'Ivoire until it crosses Antarctica and

08:36.540 --> 08:40.960
goes north, you'll end up intersecting Vanuatu which is one of seven countries worldwide

08:40.960 --> 08:46.120
to not be part of the International Criminal Police Organization, also known as Interpol.

08:46.120 --> 08:49.900
Another non-Interpol member country is Tuvalu which is the second smallest country in the

08:49.900 --> 08:52.580
world to have a commercial international airport.

08:52.580 --> 08:56.740
This is also the second video in a row that I've used this image—watch my last video

08:56.740 --> 08:58.540
to find out why.

08:58.540 --> 09:02.340
Nauru is the smallest country outright to have an airport and it rather controversially

09:02.340 --> 09:07.260
has camps for those who attempt to seek asylum in Australia, many of whom are from Iraq.

09:07.260 --> 09:12.540
Iraq borders Iran which has 22 ski resorts that's more than the entire South American

09:12.540 --> 09:13.540
continent.

09:13.560 --> 09:17.320
Speaking of South America, we haven't covered Paraguay which is another one of these landlocked

09:17.320 --> 09:22.040
countries with a navy and with that, we've touched on every South American country.

09:22.040 --> 09:25.680
If you dig a hole through the earth from Paraguay, you end up just north of Philippines which

09:25.680 --> 09:28.400
is our seventh to last Asian country.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.520
The other ones are Myanmar which is one of the world's three countries not using the

09:31.520 --> 09:36.620
metric system, Timor-Leste whose currency is the US dollar despite having no real connections

09:36.620 --> 09:41.360
to the US, Pakistan which is home to the third largest non-polar glacier in the world despite

09:41.360 --> 09:45.660
being at the same latitude of South Texas, Jordan which you may think is landlocked from

09:45.660 --> 09:50.140
looking at a map but actually has a 16 mile coast on the Red Sea, Syria which is home

09:50.140 --> 09:54.980
to Damascus, the oldest continuously inhabited city on the planet, and Kuwait which has the

09:54.980 --> 10:00.100
highest value currency in the world at $3.3 US dollars to each Kuwaiti dinar.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.400
With that, we've covered every Asian country.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.260
One of the lowest value currencies in the world is the Sautomé and Príncipe Dobra

10:07.260 --> 10:09.820
at $23,000 to the dollar.

10:09.820 --> 10:14.600
Sautomé and Príncipe speaks Portuguese which means we've covered every Portuguese-speaking

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
country.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.920
The country is also off the coast of Cameroon which became the first African country to

10:18.920 --> 10:23.600
reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in 1990 although that's since been accomplished

10:23.600 --> 10:28.640
by Ghana where the official and primary language is English and there are only three more countries

10:28.640 --> 10:29.640
like this.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.780
Belize, the only English-speaking country in Central America, Barbados, who has the

10:33.780 --> 10:37.900
third highest human development index score in the western hemisphere, and Antigua and

10:37.900 --> 10:43.720
Barbuda whose native language, Taino, is the origin of English words like canoe, barbeque,

10:43.720 --> 10:44.720
hammock, and hurricane.

10:44.720 --> 10:48.680
So, we've covered every English-speaking country but there are two remaining countries

10:48.680 --> 10:53.320
that were part of the British Empire—Dominica where Antillean Creole is the primary language

10:53.320 --> 10:58.160
and Mauritius which has the highest population density in Africa at over 1,500 people per

10:58.160 --> 10:59.160
square mile.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.840
One of the lowest population densities in Africa is in the Central African Republic

11:02.840 --> 11:04.880
at 18 people per square mile.

11:04.880 --> 11:08.780
The Central African Republic's northern neighbor is Chad whose embassy in Washington

11:08.780 --> 11:14.860
DC is only 200 feet away from that of Burkina Faso whose capital has perhaps the best name

11:14.860 --> 11:16.800
in the world—Quagadougou.

11:16.800 --> 11:20.580
In the southeast of Burkina Faso is this piece of togo that is only connected to the main

11:20.580 --> 11:23.300
part by a 300 foot wide strip of land.

11:23.300 --> 11:27.580
This area's roads, however, all come from Burkina Faso which means that, much like Point

11:27.580 --> 11:32.260
Roberts, residents need to cross two international borders to get to their own country.

11:32.260 --> 11:34.700
There are only three African countries left.

11:34.700 --> 11:38.840
Comoros, the second largest vanilla producer in the world, Burundi, the poorest country

11:38.840 --> 11:43.400
in the world to have an Olympic medal, and Eritrea which has neither an official or majority

11:43.400 --> 11:44.640
spoken language.

11:44.640 --> 11:48.520
Drawing a latitude line west from Eritrea brings you to Nicaragua, home to a lake on

11:48.520 --> 11:50.000
an island in a lake.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.660
More than 100,000 Nicaraguans live in nearby El Salvador which is the smallest Central

11:54.660 --> 11:58.040
American country and the only one not to have a Caribbean coastline.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.980
El Salvador's northern neighbor is Guatemala whose border with Mexico was originally defined

12:01.980 --> 12:06.000
by the course of the Chixoy River but erosion has changed the course which created a bunch

12:06.000 --> 12:08.800
of enclaves and exclaves like this, this, and this.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.040
And that's our last country in the western hemisphere, we're getting close.

12:12.040 --> 12:15.720
Guatemala's embassy in Ottawa is about 900 feet away from Slovenia's which has this

12:15.720 --> 12:20.240
really messed up border with Croatia including this tiny section which isn't actually claimed

12:20.240 --> 12:22.960
by either country making it Terra Nulis.

12:22.960 --> 12:28.800
The tenth and final country to end in NIA and our final country is Albania whose capital

12:28.800 --> 12:31.600
is one of the only in Europe to not have a McDonald's.

But wait, if you draw a latitude line from the south of Albania that brings you to the

12:35.380 --> 12:40.460
north of Afghanistan where Albania sent 44 troops to fight in 2005 and that's where

12:40.460 --> 12:44.420
we started this video so if you're feeling like a second round, click here to start again.

12:44.420 --> 12:46.700
I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.

12:46.700 --> 12:51.300
I'm very happy to announce that I've partnered with DFTBA to bring you Wendover Productions

12:51.300 --> 12:53.700
t-shirts which look like this.

12:53.700 --> 12:55.660
There are two ways to get one of these.

12:55.660 --> 13:00.320
You can become a patron on Patreon at the $20 level and receive a bunch of other great

13:00.320 --> 13:04.300
perks like stickers, handwritten letters, early access to videos, behind the scenes

13:04.300 --> 13:08.820
updates and more, or you can just purchase this shirt by itself for the very reasonable

13:08.820 --> 13:13.080
cost of $20 and have it shipped to anywhere in the world.

13:13.080 --> 13:16.380
This is the link to order that shirt or it's also in the description.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.880
