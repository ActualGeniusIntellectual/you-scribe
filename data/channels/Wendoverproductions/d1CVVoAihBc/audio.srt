00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
This is Every Country in the World Part 2 by Wendover Productions.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,400
If you haven't seen part one, click here to watch that first.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,800
We left off last time in Suriname, our 98th country.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,680
Suriname is the only country other than the Netherlands whose sole primary language is

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,040
Dutch although there are other countries that speak a creole version of Dutch like Namibia,

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,680
which speaks Afrikaans which is just close enough to Dutch that a Dutch and Namibian

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,080
could hold a conversation.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,000
Namibia has this long protrusion which gives them access to the Zambezi river although

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,160
they miss out by about 300 feet on bordering Zimbabwe which is the country ferries have

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,160
to pass through when making the 600 foot trip from Botswana to Zambia.

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,760
This is likely the shortest ferry in the world to cross through three countries.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,080
To the northeast of Zambia is one of the world's 176 tri-points—triple border crossings.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,240
This one links Zambia to Malawi and Tanzania whose northern border is a very straight line

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,720
across Lake Victoria which creates these two tiny cut-off peninsulas.

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,640
Uganda is a surprisingly progressive nation with the highest representation of women in

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,400
parliament in the world at 63%.

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,480
They also became the first country in the world to outright ban plastic bags in 2007.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,120
The Solomon Islands, on the other hand, only has one women in their parliament or 2% representation.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,280
The Solomon Islands is home to the West Georgia Islands which share a name with Georgia which

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,080
kind of shares a name with Georgia's Plain in Jamaica which is one of two countries in

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,800
the world whose flag doesn't share colors with the American flag as in no red, white,

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
or blue.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,280
The other one is Mauritania, but Libya used to be on that list until they changed their

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,960
flag from this to this in 2011.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,680
Libya is so large that its northwest point is closer to Luxembourg than to its southeast

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
point.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Luxembourg has the second highest per capita income in the world behind Qatar, a small

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,880
but mighty country that's just a bit larger than Lebanon who shares a southern border

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,140
with a United Nations Disengagement Observer Force zone which is an area essentially without

30
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,920
sovereignty meant to serve as a buffer between Israeli controlled Syria and Syria.

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,600
One could call it a demilitarized zone, although the most famous DMZ is north of South Korea

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,920
where if you dig a hole straight down and through the earth you'd pop up just off

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,360
the coast of Uruguay.

34
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,920
Uruguay was a military dictatorship up until 1985 but Thailand still is, the only current

35
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
one.

36
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,640
Bangkok, Thailand is the most visited city in the world at 16 million yearly visitors

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:19,180
which is a ton especially compared to Vilnius, Lithuania which only sees 180,000 visitors

38
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,180
per year.

39
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,460
Romania has a rather straight border through this lake which leads to two peninsulas with

40
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,500
their tops chopped off and an internationally divided islands with Belarus which has a rather

41
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,100
straight border in this lake which leads to another peninsula with its top chopped off

42
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,420
and an internationally divided island with Latvia.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,980
Latvia's independence day is May the 4th, aka Star Wars day, whose scenes on Tatooine

44
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,660
were filmed in Tunisia.

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,240
Tunisia's currency is the dinar which is also the name for the currency in Macedonia.

46
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,340
If you look at Macedonia on a map, it will almost always have FYROM under its name which

47
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,040
stands for Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,560
When Macedonia became an independent country, it picked this name, but Greece wasn't all

49
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,000
too happy about it since their northern region is also called Macedonia so the solution was

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,460
to call the country the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in all official capacities while

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,400
colloquially it's still known as Macedonia.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,960
Greece is known for having a huge expatriated population around the world and the 39th largest

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,400
Greek population in the world is in Oman in the middle east.

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,860
Inside Oman is an exclave of the United Arab Emirates, except this part of Oman is actually

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:24,140
an enclave inside the UAE which makes this the only double enclave in the middle east.

56
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,580
The UAE is one of 18 countries worldwide to not have a river, one of which is Tonga which

57
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,840
actually has an Olympic medal from their super heavyweight boxer Paya Wolfgram.

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,620
Another country that has one total medal is Gabon whose southern border is shared with

59
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,780
Congo whose southern border is shared with this rather large exclave of Angola.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,960
Only because of that exclave, Angola borders both Congo and the Democratic Republic of

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
the Congo.

62
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,040
These are of course two different countries, although they're both named for the Congo

63
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,040
River—the deepest river in the world at more than 750 feet deep.

64
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,920
Interestingly, despite being both enormous countries, their current capitals are just

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,100
on opposite sides of the Congo from each other.

66
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:05,120
The DRC has this great clean border with Rwanda which causes no problems at all, unlike this

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,400
one in Austria.

68
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,900
Jungholz is only connected to the rest of Austria by about 15 feet of territory and

69
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,900
no roads.

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,180
Vienna, Austria used to be the capital of the Austria-Hungarian Empire whose territory

71
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,820
included present day Italy, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia, all of which

72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,940
we've already talked about, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Czech Republic, Hungary,

73
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,240
Romania, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,820
Ukraine has this southern section which isn't part of Russia yet, although it's only connected

75
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,980
to the rest of Ukraine by two roads, one of which rather inconveniently passes through

76
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,520
Moldova for only about three miles.

77
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,560
Moldova is rated the third least touristy country in the world since only one tourist

78
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:47,520
visits each year for every 323 citizens, although Bangladesh is the number one least touristy

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,760
country since for each yearly tourist visit there are 1,273 Bangladeshi citizens.

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:59,240
Bahrain, on the other hand, receives 7.7 tourist visits per citizen per year and also has an

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,800
internationally divided island, but this one was actually very purposefully created to

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,100
serve as a passport control point between Bahrain and Saudi Arabia on the King Fahd

83
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Khaswe.

84
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,340
Saudi Arabia is home to Mecca, the birthplace of the central figure of Islam, the prophet

85
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Muhammad.

86
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,360
Mecca has a population of about 1.5 million but during the Hajj, the yearly pilgrimage

87
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,540
to Mecca, this triples to almost 5 million people.

88
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,760
Land in Mecca is some of the most expensive in the world at up to $13,000 per square foot.

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,740
Saudi Arabia really isn't great friends with their southern neighbor, Yemen, who owns

90
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,280
over 200 islands including Sakuchir Island which is surprisingly green compared to its

91
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,720
mainland neighbors and is the only place in the world where you can find the dragon's

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
blood tree.

93
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,680
Yemen's national soccer team has played Bhutan three times in the last few decades,

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,000
all of which Bhutan lost rather horribly.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,980
Bhutan is home to the Gengar Puenza Mountain which is believed to be the tallest, unsummited

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,560
mountain in the world since local spiritual beliefs prohibit anyone from climbing a mountain

97
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,700
over 6,000 meters.

98
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,700
This mountain is in the Himalayas Range which if you follow to the west brings you to Nepal

99
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,360
which is of course home to Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world.

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,120
Everest is 29,029 feet tall—880 times higher than the Marshall Islands tallest peak at

101
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,120
33 feet.

102
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,320
If you dig a hole straight down through the earth from the Marshall Islands you arrive

103
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,080
just off the coast from Liberia which is the country of registration of 11% of the world's

104
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
ships.

105
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,180
With 1,771 registered ships, though, only 190 are actually owned by Liberians.

106
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,220
Foreigners register their ships there since there are few regulations and low costs.

107
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:39,540
Malta also registers many ships for the same reason with 1,437 foreign owned ships.

108
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,500
Malta is a European Union member which means that we've almost talked about every EU

109
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
member.

110
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,220
Our last two are Estonia and Ireland whose northernmost point is actually farther north

111
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,740
than Northern Ireland's.

112
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,600
Ireland has played Samoa six times in rugby and Samoa actually won once which is quite

113
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,160
impressive for a country of less than 200,000.

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,480
Samoa's rugby team did once lose to New Zealand 101-14 though so they're not that

115
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
good.

116
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,240
New Zealand has a kind of territory of Nui.

117
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,020
It's recognized as a freely associated state, meaning by choice, but Nui isn't recognized

118
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,400
by the UN as an independent country.

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,080
However, Nui is exactly on the opposite side of the world from Niger which is named for

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
the Niger River.

121
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,820
The Niger River has probably the most bizarre river course in the world.

122
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,180
It starts only 150 miles from the Atlantic Ocean but then takes a 2,600 mile path to

123
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,300
reach the ocean.

124
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,240
It starts in Sierra Leone, flows through Guinea, Mali, Niger itself, then Benin before reaching

125
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,660
the ocean in Nigeria.

126
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,480
Nigeria is also named after the Niger River and is by far the most populous country in

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,800
Africa at 125 million people.

128
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,780
The least populous country in Africa is the Seychelles which isn't on the mainland but

129
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,980
is still considered an African country.

130
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:56,120
They also have what might be the coolest flag in the world, except for maybe St. Lucia's,

131
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,080
but I do have to give a solid runners up position to St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

132
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,000
St. Vincent and the Grenadines name is rather purposefully similar to that of its neighboring

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
island, Grenada.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,080
Grenada's airport wasn't built until 1985, but nowadays you can fly to places like Port

135
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,000
of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,640
Trinidad is also the name of a municipality of 20,000 people in Honduras which has two

137
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,840
capitals—Tagusa Galpa and Coma Yaguya.

138
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,140
Much like the Cote d'Ivoire, whose capitals are Yamasucro and Abadjan, despite having

139
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,860
a very easy English translation—the Ivory Coast—the Cote d'Ivoire is almost always

140
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,400
referred to by this name since its government refuses to accept any translated name.

141
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,540
If you draw a straight line south from Cote d'Ivoire until it crosses Antarctica and

142
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,960
goes north, you'll end up intersecting Vanuatu which is one of seven countries worldwide

143
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,120
to not be part of the International Criminal Police Organization, also known as Interpol.

144
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,900
Another non-Interpol member country is Tuvalu which is the second smallest country in the

145
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,580
world to have a commercial international airport.

146
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,740
This is also the second video in a row that I've used this image—watch my last video

147
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,540
to find out why.

148
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,340
Nauru is the smallest country outright to have an airport and it rather controversially

149
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,260
has camps for those who attempt to seek asylum in Australia, many of whom are from Iraq.

150
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,540
Iraq borders Iran which has 22 ski resorts that's more than the entire South American

151
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
continent.

152
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,320
Speaking of South America, we haven't covered Paraguay which is another one of these landlocked

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,040
countries with a navy and with that, we've touched on every South American country.

154
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,680
If you dig a hole through the earth from Paraguay, you end up just north of Philippines which

155
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,400
is our seventh to last Asian country.

156
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,520
The other ones are Myanmar which is one of the world's three countries not using the

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,620
metric system, Timor-Leste whose currency is the US dollar despite having no real connections

158
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,360
to the US, Pakistan which is home to the third largest non-polar glacier in the world despite

159
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,660
being at the same latitude of South Texas, Jordan which you may think is landlocked from

160
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,140
looking at a map but actually has a 16 mile coast on the Red Sea, Syria which is home

161
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,980
to Damascus, the oldest continuously inhabited city on the planet, and Kuwait which has the

162
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,100
highest value currency in the world at $3.3 US dollars to each Kuwaiti dinar.

163
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,400
With that, we've covered every Asian country.

164
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,260
One of the lowest value currencies in the world is the Sautomé and Príncipe Dobra

165
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,820
at $23,000 to the dollar.

166
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,600
Sautomé and Príncipe speaks Portuguese which means we've covered every Portuguese-speaking

167
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
country.

168
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,920
The country is also off the coast of Cameroon which became the first African country to

169
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,600
reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in 1990 although that's since been accomplished

170
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,640
by Ghana where the official and primary language is English and there are only three more countries

171
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
like this.

172
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,780
Belize, the only English-speaking country in Central America, Barbados, who has the

173
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,900
third highest human development index score in the western hemisphere, and Antigua and

174
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,720
Barbuda whose native language, Taino, is the origin of English words like canoe, barbeque,

175
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
hammock, and hurricane.

176
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,680
So, we've covered every English-speaking country but there are two remaining countries

177
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,320
that were part of the British Empire—Dominica where Antillean Creole is the primary language

178
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:58,160
and Mauritius which has the highest population density in Africa at over 1,500 people per

179
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
square mile.

180
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,840
One of the lowest population densities in Africa is in the Central African Republic

181
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,880
at 18 people per square mile.

182
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,780
The Central African Republic's northern neighbor is Chad whose embassy in Washington

183
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,860
DC is only 200 feet away from that of Burkina Faso whose capital has perhaps the best name

184
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,800
in the world—Quagadougou.

185
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,580
In the southeast of Burkina Faso is this piece of togo that is only connected to the main

186
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,300
part by a 300 foot wide strip of land.

187
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,580
This area's roads, however, all come from Burkina Faso which means that, much like Point

188
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,260
Roberts, residents need to cross two international borders to get to their own country.

189
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,700
There are only three African countries left.

190
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,840
Comoros, the second largest vanilla producer in the world, Burundi, the poorest country

191
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,400
in the world to have an Olympic medal, and Eritrea which has neither an official or majority

192
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,640
spoken language.

193
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,520
Drawing a latitude line west from Eritrea brings you to Nicaragua, home to a lake on

194
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,000
an island in a lake.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,660
More than 100,000 Nicaraguans live in nearby El Salvador which is the smallest Central

196
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,040
American country and the only one not to have a Caribbean coastline.

197
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,980
El Salvador's northern neighbor is Guatemala whose border with Mexico was originally defined

198
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,000
by the course of the Chixoy River but erosion has changed the course which created a bunch

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,800
of enclaves and exclaves like this, this, and this.

200
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,040
And that's our last country in the western hemisphere, we're getting close.

201
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,720
Guatemala's embassy in Ottawa is about 900 feet away from Slovenia's which has this

202
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,240
really messed up border with Croatia including this tiny section which isn't actually claimed

203
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,960
by either country making it Terra Nulis.

204
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:28,800
The tenth and final country to end in NIA and our final country is Albania whose capital

205
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,600
is one of the only in Europe to not have a McDonald's.

206
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,380
But wait, if you draw a latitude line from the south of Albania that brings you to the

207
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,460
north of Afghanistan where Albania sent 44 troops to fight in 2005 and that's where

208
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,420
we started this video so if you're feeling like a second round, click here to start again.

209
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,700
I hope you enjoyed this Wendover Productions video.

210
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,300
I'm very happy to announce that I've partnered with DFTBA to bring you Wendover Productions

211
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,700
t-shirts which look like this.

212
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,660
There are two ways to get one of these.

213
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,320
You can become a patron on Patreon at the $20 level and receive a bunch of other great

214
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,300
perks like stickers, handwritten letters, early access to videos, behind the scenes

215
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,820
updates and more, or you can just purchase this shirt by itself for the very reasonable

216
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,080
cost of $20 and have it shipped to anywhere in the world.

217
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,380
This is the link to order that shirt or it's also in the description.

218
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,880
