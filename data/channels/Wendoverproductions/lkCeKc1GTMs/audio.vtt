00:10.020 --> 00:11.020
So here's the question.

00:11.020 --> 00:15.500
Let's say you hop on a plane from New York to Amsterdam then transfer onto a plane to

00:15.500 --> 00:17.280
Cape Town, South Africa.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.740
Upon arrival in Amsterdam, passengers just pop out into the terminal and then re-board

00:21.740 --> 00:22.740
the next plane.

00:22.740 --> 00:27.080
You never would have gone through passport control so which country were you in during

00:27.080 --> 00:28.340
your connection?

00:28.340 --> 00:32.500
The simple answer is the Netherlands, but you weren't in the same Netherlands as people

00:32.500 --> 00:34.180
in downtown Amsterdam.

00:34.180 --> 00:39.060
The international zone of airports is part of the country in which it is physically located,

00:39.060 --> 00:40.120
more or less.

00:40.120 --> 00:44.400
It almost operates as a separate country because a border control agent would say you weren't

00:44.400 --> 00:47.420
in the Netherlands but a police officer would say you were.

00:47.420 --> 00:51.780
You were in the Netherlands in a legal sense but not in an immigration sense.

00:51.780 --> 00:53.900
This can create complications.

00:53.900 --> 00:58.420
Chinese citizens, for example, don't need a visa to transfer from one flight to another

00:58.420 --> 01:02.860
through Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, but they do need a visa to enter the Netherlands.

01:02.860 --> 01:07.980
If a Chinese citizen without a visa commits a crime in Amsterdam airport, that crime must

01:07.980 --> 01:13.180
be tried in a Dutch court, but if they don't have a visa the Chinese offender can't legally

01:13.180 --> 01:14.660
enter the Netherlands.

01:14.660 --> 01:19.700
The country therefore has the rather amazing ability to create a floating international

01:19.700 --> 01:21.980
zone around the Chinese citizen.

01:21.980 --> 01:26.300
No matter where they go, they are not in the Netherlands even if they are walking down

01:26.300 --> 01:27.900
the streets of Amsterdam.

01:27.900 --> 01:31.700
They will never have gone through passport control or had their passport stamped, but

01:31.700 --> 01:34.300
they'll still be in the Netherlands physically.

01:34.300 --> 01:38.220
Of course, though, they'll always be in the captivity of police officers.

01:38.220 --> 01:41.980
The question of which country you're in in airports can get a little more complicated

01:41.980 --> 01:43.700
thanks to the USA.

01:43.700 --> 01:48.660
The US operates a unique system of customs pre-clearance facilities at a number of airports

01:48.660 --> 01:51.740
and some train stations and ports around the world.

01:51.740 --> 01:56.940
Essentially, when flying from Dublin to New York, for example, you clear US customs in

01:56.940 --> 02:01.420
Dublin so that once you arrive in New York, you can immediately walk straight out of the

02:01.420 --> 02:05.260
airport with no further checks just like a domestic traveler.

02:05.260 --> 02:11.500
So, once you pass through US customs in Ireland, you're in the US in an immigration sense,

02:11.500 --> 02:13.260
but here's where it gets tricky.

02:13.260 --> 02:16.940
You're in the US, but you're not on US soil.

02:16.940 --> 02:21.580
Irish laws still apply past US customs in Dublin airport.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.500
Of course, there are exceptions.

02:23.500 --> 02:28.180
The US border agents working the facility are, on the other hand, subject to US laws

02:28.180 --> 02:30.160
despite being in Ireland.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.020
They are essentially treated like diplomats.

02:33.020 --> 02:37.820
Crime is pretty rare in airports so this doesn't normally cause problems, but consider this.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.620
There's a pre-clearance facility in Abu Dhabi airport in the United Arab Emirates where

02:42.620 --> 02:48.300
homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with fines, prison time, or worse.

02:48.300 --> 02:52.620
That means that if you got a little frisky past US customs in Abu Dhabi airport, you

02:52.620 --> 02:56.800
could technically be arrested while in the US for being gay.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.980
Of course this would never happen because it would create a diplomatic incident of monumental

03:00.980 --> 03:04.420
proportions, but the point is that it could happen.

03:04.420 --> 03:09.340
Speaking of diplomacy, more jurisdictional fuzziness comes with the United Nations headquarters

03:09.340 --> 03:10.860
in New York.

03:10.860 --> 03:16.540
The territory this building is on is technically international territory, not part of the US.

03:16.540 --> 03:21.860
In general US laws apply, but the UN can, at their own discretion, make their own laws

03:21.860 --> 03:23.980
that trump US law.

03:23.980 --> 03:28.780
For example, the UN headquarters in New York is allowed to issue stamps and run their own

03:28.780 --> 03:33.580
postal service for its employees—something that would be illegal in the US.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.860
There are more ways to visit countries without going through immigration.

03:37.860 --> 03:42.420
Back in the 40's, Russia and Estonia redrew their border and ended up making a bit of

03:42.420 --> 03:48.060
a peninsula of Russia jutting out into Estonia between the towns of Lutepa and Cessniki.

03:48.060 --> 03:52.080
As part of the Soviet Union, it wasn't a problem for Estonia to build the road between

03:52.080 --> 03:56.640
the two villages through the peninsula since the borders were rather porous.

03:56.640 --> 04:01.640
When the Soviet Union fell, though, the border became one of the most guarded in the world

04:01.640 --> 04:05.420
and therefore Cessniki was cut off from the rest of Estonia.

04:05.420 --> 04:10.180
So, Russia decided to allow cars to drive the short route with no border controls, no

04:10.180 --> 04:14.020
paperwork, nothing as long as they don't stop.

04:14.020 --> 04:18.340
Border agents watch cameras at both ends to make sure that any car that goes in one end

04:18.340 --> 04:22.840
comes out the other and sends in agents if a car takes too long, but this road allows

04:22.840 --> 04:27.420
individuals to visit one of the most guarded countries on earth without a visa or even

04:27.420 --> 04:28.900
a passport.

04:28.900 --> 04:33.740
Despite the US's affinity for large walls, secure borders, and heavily armed agents,

04:33.740 --> 04:39.500
you can legally visit the US without passing through border controls or immigration.

04:39.500 --> 04:44.240
As the longest international border in the world, there are actually quite a few unguarded

04:44.240 --> 04:48.820
border crossings on the US-Canada border, but when crossing one you are still required

04:48.820 --> 04:54.020
to self-report to the nearest border patrol station with one exception.

04:54.020 --> 04:58.580
Hyder, Alaska has the unique distinction of being the only town in the southern half of

04:58.580 --> 05:02.580
Alaska's panhandle to be connected to the outside world by road.

05:02.580 --> 05:07.100
That is, though, because it is directly across the border from Canada.

05:07.100 --> 05:12.420
Beyond that, the only roads into Hyder come from Canada and you can't drive anywhere

05:12.420 --> 05:14.620
in the United States from Hyder.

05:14.620 --> 05:19.940
There are therefore no US border controls when passing into Hyder and there's no requirement

05:19.940 --> 05:22.620
to self-report to a border patrol station.

05:22.620 --> 05:27.540
There is, however, a Canadian border control station when passing back into Canada from

05:27.540 --> 05:32.660
Hyder meaning you could accidentally cross into the US without a passport and then get

05:32.660 --> 05:33.660
stuck.

05:33.660 --> 05:37.300
Hyder is essentially a Canadian town stuck in Alaska.

05:37.300 --> 05:41.980
The residents unofficially use the time zone of British Columbia rather than Alaska, use

05:41.980 --> 05:47.660
Canadian dollars, have Canadian phone numbers, and use Canadian fire and ambulance services.

05:47.660 --> 05:51.900
Perhaps most interesting, however, is that you need a passport to travel to the United

05:51.900 --> 05:53.740
States from Hyder.

05:53.740 --> 05:57.940
While it doesn't have an airport, it does have a seaplane base with regularly scheduled

05:57.940 --> 06:01.040
commercial flights to Ketchikan, Alaska.

06:01.040 --> 06:07.560
Even though this flight is fully within the same country and state upon arrival in Ketchikan,

06:07.560 --> 06:10.360
all passengers are sent through US customs.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.140
It makes sense.

06:12.140 --> 06:16.160
The reason Hyder doesn't have US customs is because there's no way to get out to

06:16.160 --> 06:21.200
the rest of the US, but this flight is the only time that you need a passport to travel

06:21.200 --> 06:23.920
from one part of the US to another.

06:23.920 --> 06:28.440
Now for the granddaddy of which country am I in questions.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.800
Which country are you in while in a plane?

06:30.800 --> 06:36.120
Let's say you're flying on an Irish registered airplane from Paris over Canada to New York.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.300
Are you in Ireland, France, Canada, or the United States?

06:39.300 --> 06:41.440
This gets super complicated.

06:41.440 --> 06:45.680
According to immigration law, you are not in any country, just like in an international

06:45.680 --> 06:50.620
airport, even though you are physically in the sovereign territory of Canada.

06:50.620 --> 06:55.240
Each country sets its own upper limit to its sovereignty above earth but all countries

06:55.240 --> 06:58.680
have their limit above the altitude at which planes fly.

06:58.680 --> 07:03.600
From a legal view, however, within that plane you could be in Ireland, France, Canada, and

07:03.600 --> 07:05.680
the United States all at once.

07:05.680 --> 07:09.680
Jurisdiction for crimes committed in the air gets really fuzzy.

07:09.680 --> 07:13.720
Depending on their own laws, each country could prosecute the same crime.

07:13.720 --> 07:18.520
Most of the time, the laws that apply are those of the aircraft's country of registration—Ireland

07:18.520 --> 07:24.040
in this case—but assuming the plane continued to its final destination in the US, the arresting

07:24.040 --> 07:28.920
officers for a crime would be US police and therefore, unless another country claimed

07:28.920 --> 07:34.360
jurisdiction, the trial would take place in the US under US law since the plane landed

07:34.360 --> 07:35.640
in the US.

07:35.640 --> 07:39.040
However, Canada could also claim jurisdiction.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.800
In 1998, Pan Am Flight 103 was brought down by terrorists over Lockerbie, Scotland.

07:44.800 --> 07:50.040
Of course jurisdiction was a huge issue, especially considering the suspects were Libyan, but

07:50.040 --> 07:54.440
in the end, the trial was held in a Scottish court under Scott law.

07:54.440 --> 07:59.000
Since it was overflying Scotland and therefore in Scottish territory when the plane was brought

07:59.000 --> 08:04.280
down, they got jurisdiction, however, for complicated diplomatic reasons relating to

08:04.280 --> 08:09.440
the extradition of the suspects, the trial was actually held in an old US air force base

08:09.440 --> 08:13.720
in the Netherlands that was temporarily ceded over to Scotland.

08:13.720 --> 08:19.240
The rather disappointing answer to which country you're in when flying is that it depends.

08:19.240 --> 08:23.720
Police will just claim or ignore their jurisdiction depending on convenience.

08:23.720 --> 08:33.280
In the end, the only way to find out might just be to hop on a flight and commit a crime.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.160
This video was made possible by Hover.

08:35.160 --> 08:40.080
Hover is by far the easiest, best, and often the least expensive way to buy your custom

08:40.080 --> 08:43.520
domain or email—there's just so much to love about them.

08:43.520 --> 08:53.780
When you call customer support, this happens—they just pick up and answer your question.

08:53.780 --> 08:56.640
No holding, no phone trees, it's that simple.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.980
While I've bought plenty of domains from Hover, what I recently started to use Hover

08:59.980 --> 09:01.520
for is email.

09:01.520 --> 09:06.920
