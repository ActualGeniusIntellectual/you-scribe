10020	11020	So here's the question.
11020	15500	Let's say you hop on a plane from New York to Amsterdam then transfer onto a plane to
15500	17280	Cape Town, South Africa.
17280	21740	Upon arrival in Amsterdam, passengers just pop out into the terminal and then re-board
21740	22740	the next plane.
22740	27080	You never would have gone through passport control so which country were you in during
27080	28340	your connection?
28340	32500	The simple answer is the Netherlands, but you weren't in the same Netherlands as people
32500	34180	in downtown Amsterdam.
34180	39060	The international zone of airports is part of the country in which it is physically located,
39060	40120	more or less.
40120	44400	It almost operates as a separate country because a border control agent would say you weren't
44400	47420	in the Netherlands but a police officer would say you were.
47420	51780	You were in the Netherlands in a legal sense but not in an immigration sense.
51780	53900	This can create complications.
53900	58420	Chinese citizens, for example, don't need a visa to transfer from one flight to another
58420	62860	through Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, but they do need a visa to enter the Netherlands.
62860	67980	If a Chinese citizen without a visa commits a crime in Amsterdam airport, that crime must
67980	73180	be tried in a Dutch court, but if they don't have a visa the Chinese offender can't legally
73180	74660	enter the Netherlands.
74660	79700	The country therefore has the rather amazing ability to create a floating international
79700	81980	zone around the Chinese citizen.
81980	86300	No matter where they go, they are not in the Netherlands even if they are walking down
86300	87900	the streets of Amsterdam.
87900	91700	They will never have gone through passport control or had their passport stamped, but
91700	94300	they'll still be in the Netherlands physically.
94300	98220	Of course, though, they'll always be in the captivity of police officers.
98220	101980	The question of which country you're in in airports can get a little more complicated
101980	103700	thanks to the USA.
103700	108660	The US operates a unique system of customs pre-clearance facilities at a number of airports
108660	111740	and some train stations and ports around the world.
111740	116940	Essentially, when flying from Dublin to New York, for example, you clear US customs in
116940	121420	Dublin so that once you arrive in New York, you can immediately walk straight out of the
121420	125260	airport with no further checks just like a domestic traveler.
125260	131500	So, once you pass through US customs in Ireland, you're in the US in an immigration sense,
131500	133260	but here's where it gets tricky.
133260	136940	You're in the US, but you're not on US soil.
136940	141580	Irish laws still apply past US customs in Dublin airport.
141580	143500	Of course, there are exceptions.
143500	148180	The US border agents working the facility are, on the other hand, subject to US laws
148180	150160	despite being in Ireland.
150160	153020	They are essentially treated like diplomats.
153020	157820	Crime is pretty rare in airports so this doesn't normally cause problems, but consider this.
157820	162620	There's a pre-clearance facility in Abu Dhabi airport in the United Arab Emirates where
162620	168300	homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with fines, prison time, or worse.
168300	172620	That means that if you got a little frisky past US customs in Abu Dhabi airport, you
172620	176800	could technically be arrested while in the US for being gay.
176800	180980	Of course this would never happen because it would create a diplomatic incident of monumental
180980	184420	proportions, but the point is that it could happen.
184420	189340	Speaking of diplomacy, more jurisdictional fuzziness comes with the United Nations headquarters
189340	190860	in New York.
190860	196540	The territory this building is on is technically international territory, not part of the US.
196540	201860	In general US laws apply, but the UN can, at their own discretion, make their own laws
201860	203980	that trump US law.
203980	208780	For example, the UN headquarters in New York is allowed to issue stamps and run their own
208780	213580	postal service for its employees—something that would be illegal in the US.
213580	217860	There are more ways to visit countries without going through immigration.
217860	222420	Back in the 40's, Russia and Estonia redrew their border and ended up making a bit of
222420	228060	a peninsula of Russia jutting out into Estonia between the towns of Lutepa and Cessniki.
228060	232080	As part of the Soviet Union, it wasn't a problem for Estonia to build the road between
232080	236640	the two villages through the peninsula since the borders were rather porous.
236640	241640	When the Soviet Union fell, though, the border became one of the most guarded in the world
241640	245420	and therefore Cessniki was cut off from the rest of Estonia.
245420	250180	So, Russia decided to allow cars to drive the short route with no border controls, no
250180	254020	paperwork, nothing as long as they don't stop.
254020	258340	Border agents watch cameras at both ends to make sure that any car that goes in one end
258340	262840	comes out the other and sends in agents if a car takes too long, but this road allows
262840	267420	individuals to visit one of the most guarded countries on earth without a visa or even
267420	268900	a passport.
268900	273740	Despite the US's affinity for large walls, secure borders, and heavily armed agents,
273740	279500	you can legally visit the US without passing through border controls or immigration.
279500	284240	As the longest international border in the world, there are actually quite a few unguarded
284240	288820	border crossings on the US-Canada border, but when crossing one you are still required
288820	294020	to self-report to the nearest border patrol station with one exception.
294020	298580	Hyder, Alaska has the unique distinction of being the only town in the southern half of
298580	302580	Alaska's panhandle to be connected to the outside world by road.
302580	307100	That is, though, because it is directly across the border from Canada.
307100	312420	Beyond that, the only roads into Hyder come from Canada and you can't drive anywhere
312420	314620	in the United States from Hyder.
314620	319940	There are therefore no US border controls when passing into Hyder and there's no requirement
319940	322620	to self-report to a border patrol station.
322620	327540	There is, however, a Canadian border control station when passing back into Canada from
327540	332660	Hyder meaning you could accidentally cross into the US without a passport and then get
332660	333660	stuck.
333660	337300	Hyder is essentially a Canadian town stuck in Alaska.
337300	341980	The residents unofficially use the time zone of British Columbia rather than Alaska, use
341980	347660	Canadian dollars, have Canadian phone numbers, and use Canadian fire and ambulance services.
347660	351900	Perhaps most interesting, however, is that you need a passport to travel to the United
351900	353740	States from Hyder.
353740	357940	While it doesn't have an airport, it does have a seaplane base with regularly scheduled
357940	361040	commercial flights to Ketchikan, Alaska.
361040	367560	Even though this flight is fully within the same country and state upon arrival in Ketchikan,
367560	370360	all passengers are sent through US customs.
370360	372140	It makes sense.
372140	376160	The reason Hyder doesn't have US customs is because there's no way to get out to
376160	381200	the rest of the US, but this flight is the only time that you need a passport to travel
381200	383920	from one part of the US to another.
383920	388440	Now for the granddaddy of which country am I in questions.
388440	390800	Which country are you in while in a plane?
390800	396120	Let's say you're flying on an Irish registered airplane from Paris over Canada to New York.
396120	399300	Are you in Ireland, France, Canada, or the United States?
399300	401440	This gets super complicated.
401440	405680	According to immigration law, you are not in any country, just like in an international
405680	410620	airport, even though you are physically in the sovereign territory of Canada.
410620	415240	Each country sets its own upper limit to its sovereignty above earth but all countries
415240	418680	have their limit above the altitude at which planes fly.
418680	423600	From a legal view, however, within that plane you could be in Ireland, France, Canada, and
423600	425680	the United States all at once.
425680	429680	Jurisdiction for crimes committed in the air gets really fuzzy.
429680	433720	Depending on their own laws, each country could prosecute the same crime.
433720	438520	Most of the time, the laws that apply are those of the aircraft's country of registration—Ireland
438520	444040	in this case—but assuming the plane continued to its final destination in the US, the arresting
444040	448920	officers for a crime would be US police and therefore, unless another country claimed
448920	454360	jurisdiction, the trial would take place in the US under US law since the plane landed
454360	455640	in the US.
455640	459040	However, Canada could also claim jurisdiction.
459040	464800	In 1998, Pan Am Flight 103 was brought down by terrorists over Lockerbie, Scotland.
464800	470040	Of course jurisdiction was a huge issue, especially considering the suspects were Libyan, but
470040	474440	in the end, the trial was held in a Scottish court under Scott law.
474440	479000	Since it was overflying Scotland and therefore in Scottish territory when the plane was brought
479000	484280	down, they got jurisdiction, however, for complicated diplomatic reasons relating to
484280	489440	the extradition of the suspects, the trial was actually held in an old US air force base
489440	493720	in the Netherlands that was temporarily ceded over to Scotland.
493720	499240	The rather disappointing answer to which country you're in when flying is that it depends.
499240	503720	Police will just claim or ignore their jurisdiction depending on convenience.
503720	513280	In the end, the only way to find out might just be to hop on a flight and commit a crime.
