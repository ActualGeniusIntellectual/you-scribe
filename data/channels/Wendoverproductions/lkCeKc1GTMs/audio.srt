3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,020
So here's the question.

4
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,500
Let's say you hop on a plane from New York to Amsterdam then transfer onto a plane to

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,280
Cape Town, South Africa.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,740
Upon arrival in Amsterdam, passengers just pop out into the terminal and then re-board

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,740
the next plane.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,080
You never would have gone through passport control so which country were you in during

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,340
your connection?

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,500
The simple answer is the Netherlands, but you weren't in the same Netherlands as people

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,180
in downtown Amsterdam.

12
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,060
The international zone of airports is part of the country in which it is physically located,

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,120
more or less.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,400
It almost operates as a separate country because a border control agent would say you weren't

15
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,420
in the Netherlands but a police officer would say you were.

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,780
You were in the Netherlands in a legal sense but not in an immigration sense.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,900
This can create complications.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,420
Chinese citizens, for example, don't need a visa to transfer from one flight to another

19
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,860
through Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, but they do need a visa to enter the Netherlands.

20
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,980
If a Chinese citizen without a visa commits a crime in Amsterdam airport, that crime must

21
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,180
be tried in a Dutch court, but if they don't have a visa the Chinese offender can't legally

22
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,660
enter the Netherlands.

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,700
The country therefore has the rather amazing ability to create a floating international

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,980
zone around the Chinese citizen.

25
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,300
No matter where they go, they are not in the Netherlands even if they are walking down

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,900
the streets of Amsterdam.

27
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,700
They will never have gone through passport control or had their passport stamped, but

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,300
they'll still be in the Netherlands physically.

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,220
Of course, though, they'll always be in the captivity of police officers.

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,980
The question of which country you're in in airports can get a little more complicated

31
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,700
thanks to the USA.

32
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,660
The US operates a unique system of customs pre-clearance facilities at a number of airports

33
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,740
and some train stations and ports around the world.

34
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,940
Essentially, when flying from Dublin to New York, for example, you clear US customs in

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:01,420
Dublin so that once you arrive in New York, you can immediately walk straight out of the

36
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,260
airport with no further checks just like a domestic traveler.

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,500
So, once you pass through US customs in Ireland, you're in the US in an immigration sense,

38
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
but here's where it gets tricky.

39
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,940
You're in the US, but you're not on US soil.

40
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,580
Irish laws still apply past US customs in Dublin airport.

41
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,500
Of course, there are exceptions.

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,180
The US border agents working the facility are, on the other hand, subject to US laws

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,160
despite being in Ireland.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,020
They are essentially treated like diplomats.

45
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,820
Crime is pretty rare in airports so this doesn't normally cause problems, but consider this.

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,620
There's a pre-clearance facility in Abu Dhabi airport in the United Arab Emirates where

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,300
homosexuality is illegal and can be punished with fines, prison time, or worse.

48
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,620
That means that if you got a little frisky past US customs in Abu Dhabi airport, you

49
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,800
could technically be arrested while in the US for being gay.

50
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,980
Of course this would never happen because it would create a diplomatic incident of monumental

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,420
proportions, but the point is that it could happen.

52
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,340
Speaking of diplomacy, more jurisdictional fuzziness comes with the United Nations headquarters

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,860
in New York.

54
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,540
The territory this building is on is technically international territory, not part of the US.

55
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,860
In general US laws apply, but the UN can, at their own discretion, make their own laws

56
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,980
that trump US law.

57
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,780
For example, the UN headquarters in New York is allowed to issue stamps and run their own

58
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,580
postal service for its employees—something that would be illegal in the US.

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,860
There are more ways to visit countries without going through immigration.

60
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,420
Back in the 40's, Russia and Estonia redrew their border and ended up making a bit of

61
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,060
a peninsula of Russia jutting out into Estonia between the towns of Lutepa and Cessniki.

62
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,080
As part of the Soviet Union, it wasn't a problem for Estonia to build the road between

63
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,640
the two villages through the peninsula since the borders were rather porous.

64
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,640
When the Soviet Union fell, though, the border became one of the most guarded in the world

65
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,420
and therefore Cessniki was cut off from the rest of Estonia.

66
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,180
So, Russia decided to allow cars to drive the short route with no border controls, no

67
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,020
paperwork, nothing as long as they don't stop.

68
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,340
Border agents watch cameras at both ends to make sure that any car that goes in one end

69
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,840
comes out the other and sends in agents if a car takes too long, but this road allows

70
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,420
individuals to visit one of the most guarded countries on earth without a visa or even

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,900
a passport.

72
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,740
Despite the US's affinity for large walls, secure borders, and heavily armed agents,

73
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,500
you can legally visit the US without passing through border controls or immigration.

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,240
As the longest international border in the world, there are actually quite a few unguarded

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,820
border crossings on the US-Canada border, but when crossing one you are still required

76
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:54,020
to self-report to the nearest border patrol station with one exception.

77
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,580
Hyder, Alaska has the unique distinction of being the only town in the southern half of

78
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,580
Alaska's panhandle to be connected to the outside world by road.

79
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,100
That is, though, because it is directly across the border from Canada.

80
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:12,420
Beyond that, the only roads into Hyder come from Canada and you can't drive anywhere

81
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,620
in the United States from Hyder.

82
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,940
There are therefore no US border controls when passing into Hyder and there's no requirement

83
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,620
to self-report to a border patrol station.

84
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,540
There is, however, a Canadian border control station when passing back into Canada from

85
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,660
Hyder meaning you could accidentally cross into the US without a passport and then get

86
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:33,660
stuck.

87
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,300
Hyder is essentially a Canadian town stuck in Alaska.

88
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,980
The residents unofficially use the time zone of British Columbia rather than Alaska, use

89
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,660
Canadian dollars, have Canadian phone numbers, and use Canadian fire and ambulance services.

90
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:51,900
Perhaps most interesting, however, is that you need a passport to travel to the United

91
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,740
States from Hyder.

92
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,940
While it doesn't have an airport, it does have a seaplane base with regularly scheduled

93
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,040
commercial flights to Ketchikan, Alaska.

94
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,560
Even though this flight is fully within the same country and state upon arrival in Ketchikan,

95
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,360
all passengers are sent through US customs.

96
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,140
It makes sense.

97
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,160
The reason Hyder doesn't have US customs is because there's no way to get out to

98
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,200
the rest of the US, but this flight is the only time that you need a passport to travel

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,920
from one part of the US to another.

100
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,440
Now for the granddaddy of which country am I in questions.

101
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,800
Which country are you in while in a plane?

102
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,120
Let's say you're flying on an Irish registered airplane from Paris over Canada to New York.

103
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,300
Are you in Ireland, France, Canada, or the United States?

104
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,440
This gets super complicated.

105
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,680
According to immigration law, you are not in any country, just like in an international

106
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,620
airport, even though you are physically in the sovereign territory of Canada.

107
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,240
Each country sets its own upper limit to its sovereignty above earth but all countries

108
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,680
have their limit above the altitude at which planes fly.

109
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,600
From a legal view, however, within that plane you could be in Ireland, France, Canada, and

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,680
the United States all at once.

111
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Jurisdiction for crimes committed in the air gets really fuzzy.

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Depending on their own laws, each country could prosecute the same crime.

113
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,520
Most of the time, the laws that apply are those of the aircraft's country of registration—Ireland

114
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,040
in this case—but assuming the plane continued to its final destination in the US, the arresting

115
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,920
officers for a crime would be US police and therefore, unless another country claimed

116
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,360
jurisdiction, the trial would take place in the US under US law since the plane landed

117
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,640
in the US.

118
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,040
However, Canada could also claim jurisdiction.

119
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,800
In 1998, Pan Am Flight 103 was brought down by terrorists over Lockerbie, Scotland.

120
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,040
Of course jurisdiction was a huge issue, especially considering the suspects were Libyan, but

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,440
in the end, the trial was held in a Scottish court under Scott law.

122
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,000
Since it was overflying Scotland and therefore in Scottish territory when the plane was brought

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,280
down, they got jurisdiction, however, for complicated diplomatic reasons relating to

124
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,440
the extradition of the suspects, the trial was actually held in an old US air force base

125
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,720
in the Netherlands that was temporarily ceded over to Scotland.

126
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:19,240
The rather disappointing answer to which country you're in when flying is that it depends.

127
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,720
Police will just claim or ignore their jurisdiction depending on convenience.

128
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:33,280
In the end, the only way to find out might just be to hop on a flight and commit a crime.

129
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,160
This video was made possible by Hover.

130
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,080
Hover is by far the easiest, best, and often the least expensive way to buy your custom

131
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,520

00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,640
No holding, no phone trees, it's that simple.

134
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,980
While I've bought plenty of domains from Hover, what I recently started to use Hover

135
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,520
