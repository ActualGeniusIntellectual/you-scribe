1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
At 12.01 am, on July 6th, 2018, this short line was added to chapter 99 of the Harmonized

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,460
Tariff Schedule of the United States.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,660
With that, new pneumatic tires, of rubber, of a kind use on aircraft, parts of stock

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,160
pumps imported for use with machines for making cellulosic pulp, paper, or cardboard, machines

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
for mixing mineral substances with bitumen, spherical roller bearings, lithium primary

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,480
cells and primary batteries, fuses for a voltage not exceeding 1,000 volts, and some 278 other

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,460
products would now be subject to a 25% import tax when coming from China to the US.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,620
This small tweak, and the $36 billion of goods it would impact, was the first volley and

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,760
would later be known as the US-China trade war.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,660
The next rounds came quick.

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,540
Just weeks after, the Trump administration initiated a smaller second package covering

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:55,560
some $16 billion in goods, then in September, after a Chinese response, an absolutely massive

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,160
package of 10% tariffs on some $200 billion.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,160
Finally, after further Chinese action, these rates were raised to a crippling 25%.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,500
Now, a Chinese-made space heater that might have sold for $48 would cost $60, or more

16
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,960
likely, a US distributor would look for suppliers from other, non-tariffed countries so that

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,160
they could get prices back down to $48.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,320
The ultimate net effect of this was an 8.5% reduction in trade from China to the US, and

19
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,740
a 26.3% decline in the reverse.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,380
But perhaps more relevantly, this spat dethroned China from its perch atop the list of US trading

21
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,620
partners.

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:40,420
Now ranking higher was Canada, in the second spot, and Mexico, as the new largest.

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,900
But the trade war would be far from the end of issues keeping China from the top.

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,760
The next emerged not out of Washington, of course, but from Wuhan.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,660
After the headlines were dominated by the news of a mystery novel coronavirus in China,

26
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,880
then by COVID's global spread, then by the world's descent into lockdown, then by breakneck

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,360
vaccine development, then by the shot's wide-scale rollout across the developed world,

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,840
summer 2021's headlines were dominated by supply chain chaos.

29
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,800
Armed with lockdown savings but still facing barriers to spending them on restaurants,

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,000
concerts, and plane tickets, American consumers started buying lots and lots of things—physical,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,360
real-world products.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,140
COVID, however, was still exerting influence, meaning dockworkers and truck drivers in California

33
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,700
were still getting sick, while their counterparts in China, Vietnam, or India were still largely

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,060
unvaccinated or vaccinated with less effective shots, meaning stricter social distancing

35
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,140
and lockdown restrictions were still in place, blunting shipping, and manufacturing itself.

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,020
The net effect was what made it to the headlines.

37
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,260
Factories struggled to produce fast enough, ships sat offshore for weeks waiting to get

38
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,200
them loaded, American store shelves sat empty as stock simply could not come fast enough.

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,600
By late 2022 the Trans-Pacific Capacity Crunch had largely dissipated, supply and demand

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,480
had equalized, and container rates had nearly returned to 2019 levels, but supply chains

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,360
were never able to fully repair as Russia's invasion of Ukraine wreaked havoc on global

42
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
trade.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,640
Sanctions cut off supply to key metals, energy and food costs rose globally, and marine and

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,360
air cargo was rerouted to avoid the belligerent nation.

45
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,380
Meanwhile, today's China is certainly not the China it used to be.

46
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,860
While perhaps a truism, up until recently, rapid economic development was the decades-long

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,060
norm, but the nation's now entered a new era.

48
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,960
In the most concise narrative, one single factor is attributed as the ultimate source

49
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,580
of China's unprecedented economic ascent—low-cost manufacturing.

50
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:41,440
China was a place where foreign firms could effectively offshore manufacturing and save

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,640
massively through low labor costs, but in many ways, the country's industrial sector

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,340
became a victim of its own success.

53
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,480
In twenty years, the nation's GDP per capita rose ten times, and with that, quality of

54
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,220
life improved massively.

55
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,180
Major Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Shenzhen started featuring the same shops,

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,820
restaurants, and hotels as Tokyo, London, or New York, the luxury goods market exploded

57
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,820
as an unprecedented number of millionaires and billionaires were minted, and a genuine

58
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,160
middle class developed, living a similar quality of life as those in the US, Europe,

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,200
or any developed nation.

60
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,520
But to the outside, to the companies that had previously offshored to China, this increase

61
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,680
in purchasing power meant a dollar didn't go as far anymore within the People's Republic.

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,560
Wages rose, and so too, in step, did manufacturing costs.

63
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,500
The peak of inbound foreign direct investment to China has long passed as multinational

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,400
enterprises have now focused elsewhere for their lowest-cost manufacturing, but this

65
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,060
was of little concern to the nation, as they were able to parlay the wealth generated from

66
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,380
this era into developing an impressive array of home-grown businesses.

67
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,300
There are behemoth e-commerce platforms like JD.com and Alibaba, sprawling tech conglomerates

68
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,660
like Tencent and Huawei, unicorn startups like DJI and Didi, even the first non-American

69
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,980
social media platform to attain global mainstream adoption with ByteDance's TikTok.

70
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,940
But TikTok is a rare exception.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,800
Overwhelmingly, the business China does with America is not through services—it's with

72
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,900
physical products.

73
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,640
Physical products need to physically travel to the American end consumer, but the problem

74
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,880
that's now coming into focus is that America is really, really far from China.

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,720
Shanghai is the world's busiest container port, while the combination of Los Angeles

76
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,360
and Long Beach is the US's, so trips between the two are about as common as they come,

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,120
but they're no small feat.

78
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,400
For the moment the Chinese coast disappears behind, a vessel won't see Los Angeles for

79
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,060
another 18 days, assuming everything goes right, which it often does not.

80
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,300
Even with massive improvements since 2021's supply chain chaos, major container carriers

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,340
only range between 50 and 60% schedule reliability.

82
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,260
Offshoring, just-in-time manufacturing, and even globalization itself are all terms and

83
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,300
phenomenons that largely developed in the past 30 years.

84
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:59,820
In fact, some experts consider the fall of the Berlin Wall as the start of the era of

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,560
peak globalization, but this era might, in retrospect, be considered bookended by the

86
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
trade war, COVID, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

87
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,840
The world has returned to a more fractured state, and it's worth remembering that prior

88
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,220
to this conflict, Russia's relationship with Europe and the US was not all that different

89
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,420
from China's today.

90
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,880
Diplomatic relations are maintained, but they're tense.

91
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,520
Certain respected Western leaders now speak of conflict with China, likely spurred by

92
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,560
an invasion of Taiwan, as inevitable.

93
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,220
So that's to say, the world is already less globalized than it was in 2017, and there

94
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,380
are certain, concerningly possible events that would make a trade war, COVID, and the

95
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,940
Russian invasion of Ukraine look like warm-up laps.

96
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,980
So, 2023, in the world of logistics, is marked by a consolidation of concerns.

97
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,460
COVID and Ukraine expose the vulnerabilities, and there's widespread concern that these

98
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,820
could only be the start.

99
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,800
The consensus, therefore, is that there are essentially two options.

100
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,680
One can fortify the globalized supply chain through building more slack in the system,

101
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
ordering components earlier, keeping more in stock, manufacturing the inventory earlier,

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,320
but this comes with a very real, surprisingly significant cost.

103
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,800
The other option is to remove the risk—remove the physical and political gulf between the

104
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,040
manufacturer and the market—and this option has proved surprisingly popular.

105
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,460
All that's needed is an alternative.

106
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,800
One developing country on the other side of the Pacific where wages are low and the workforce

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
is large.

108
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,360
A country like Mexico.

109
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,720
From a manufacturer's point of view, Mexico's not perfect.

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,640
Of 180 countries ranked by the Corruption Perception Index, Mexico comes in at 128th.

111
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,240
Of the 190 ranked by ease of doing business, Mexico ranks 60th.

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,280
Of the world's 50 busiest seaports, Mexico is home to none.

113
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,900
Mexico's largest, the port of Manzanillo, outpaced nearly six times over by that of

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,140
Los Angeles and Long Beach.

115
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,220
Further complicating things, it's hard to get around Mexico.

116
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,320
The jagged Sierra Madre ranges run from the country's northwest to its southeast, harsh

117
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,420
deserts define much of the country's north, and dense forestry covers much of its south.

118
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:13,220
The roads, rails, and bridges that cross these mountain ranges and cut through desert and

119
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,540
forest alike, well, Mexican infrastructure is getting better, but it still lags far behind

120
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,700
China's.

121
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,860
With complicated perceptions, outdated assumptions, and difficult internal transportation networks

122
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:30,320
aside, Mexico is blessed with one simple geographic gift that no country other than Canada can

123
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,280
lay claim to—it shares a border with the world's largest economy.

124
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,940
While the Rio Grande River isn't actually navigable, it's home to one of North America's

125
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,920
most valuable ports.

126
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,380
Connecting Texas and the Mexican state of Nuevo León is the World Trade International

127
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,380
Bridge.

128
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,980
Strictly commercial, eight lanes wide, it sees over 6,000 northbound trucks cross it

129
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,780
every single day, and since its construction in 2000, it has never been busier.

130
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,500
As of 2022, the inland port ranks first among American points of entry in trade value, and

131
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,740
all this increased importance in stacking traffic is by and large due to what manufacturing

132
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,860
in northern Mexico has to offer that China simply can't—speed and flexibility at

133
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,820
low cost.

134
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,720
About 150 miles, or 250 kilometers, down Mexico's Highway 85, and just outside the

135
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,340
small city of Salinas, Victoria, is this—a barren dirt lot.

136
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,760
Except, it's not actually a barren dirt lot.

137
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,120
This is Hofusan Industrial Park, a 200-acre complex constructed by a private Chinese-Mexican

138
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,980
partnership designed to pull in Chinese manufacturers.

139
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,220
It's so new, with construction beginning in 2017, that satellite maps have yet to capture

140
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,220
development.

141
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,700
But it's there.

142
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,260
And it's bold.

143
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,980
The master plan is to lure over 100 Chinese manufacturers to the gated park, build out

144
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,220
a residential area to house employees, and establish a host of services, from Chinese

145
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,420
restaurants to hotels and hospitals.

146
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,220
The idea is to build out a little slice of China where labor is stable and Chinese executives

147
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,140
and operators can feel somewhat at home.

148
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,900
With much of the land still resembling a construction site six years in, this sparkling master plan

149
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,160
is far from a reality.

150
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,100
But it is trending in the right direction.

151
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,600
In my sense, an electronics manufacturer has made the move.

152
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,820
So too have furniture makers Kuka Home, Sunan, and Manhua.

153
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:26,640
And neighboring them are more Chinese manufacturers—Fower, Skyish, Asenstar, Bell & Turf have all bought

154
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,260
into the project.

155
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,940
The incentives, especially since the opening of the trade war that's made manufacturing

156
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,260
in Mexico more cost-competitive, are just too strong.

157
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,940
Even without the restaurant, shops, and housing that's supposed to make the move more appealing

158
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,220
and the transition smoother, Chinese companies are taking the leap—inside the gates of

159
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,300
Hafezon Park and outside them too.

160
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,260
The tech company Lenovo, for instance, has been manufacturing just outside of Monterey

161
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,660
for over a decade.

162
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:58,900
And in 2022 alone, 44 separate Asian companies opened new manufacturing spaces in Mexico,

163
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,860
with 9 of the 10 largest being Chinese-owned and 7 of them opening in the state of Nuevo

164
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,860
Leon.

165
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,580
Zooming out from the state, this is a graph of Chinese investment in Mexico—this skyward

166
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,700
trajectory of investment is simply unmistakable.

167
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,940
While concerns over security and capable infrastructure still loom, the deal is too good to wait on.

168
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,140
Of course, a few dozen companies relocating across a decade-plus doesn't necessarily

169
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,060
in itself signal the rise of Mexico as the world's factory, or that China's relinquishing

170
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,860
the role, or that this is the end of offshoring as we know it.

171
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,220
Right now, the sample size is small.

172
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,020
But the reasons companies are moving to Mexico aren't going away, and the appeal of manufacturing

173
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,380
in Mexico extends beyond China.

174
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,300
While China might be new to northern Mexico, Japan isn't, South Korea isn't, and the

175
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,820
US isn't.

176
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,340
To industrial manufacturers, the region's value has been well understood for decades.

177
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,180
Years before the establishment of NAFTA, Mexico worked to maximize the appeal of its lower

178
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:04,140
costs of labor and proximity to the US by setting up the Machia Dora system—essentially,

179
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,780
low-cost, tax-advantaged factories owned by foreign companies that state officials

180
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,020
hoped would tamp down unemployment and entice foreign investment.

181
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,380
With the arrival of free trade agreements, these factories exploded in number.

182
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,380
Northern Mexico first experienced the invigorating arrival of auto companies like Kia, Toyota,

183
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,420
BMW, Ford, and Audi, among others.

184
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,040
Then came the rest as Lego, Samsung, LG, 3M, GE, and countless other recognizable brands

185
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,660
moved into the region.

186
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,420
Their collective arrival transformed the Mexican economy—in a 2012 analysis of Machia

187
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,340
Dora's, some 5,055 existed across the country, mostly in the north, and the factories employed

188
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,340
just over 2 million Mexicans.

189
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,080
The value of these turnkey factories persists too, as they help to counter narratives of

190
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Mexican states being too dangerous and unpredictable for business to places ripe and ready to establish

191
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,820
a new manufacturing hub for companies spanning the globe.

192
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,800
What Mexico has had to offer in recent decades has proven too good to pass up on.

193
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,280
The factories already exist, the wages, though higher than some Eastern developing countries,

194
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,320
are low, and by being here, not only are tariffs now out of the picture, but companies are

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,960
also relocating to a Western business environment where patent and IP production is stronger,

196
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,640
political risk is lower, and the negative optics of offshoring are minimized.

197
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,700
Simply put, beyond what's pushing Chinese manufacturers abroad, Mexico itself has developed

198
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,800
tremendous pull.

199
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,140
Automotive and electronic manufacturers from the world over made northern Mexico a home

200
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,540
away from home decades ago, fundamentally transforming the Mexican economy and creating

201
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,820
a mutually beneficial system for the country and company that shows few signs of slowing.

202
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,300
China's simply the most recent to recognize the profound appeal.

203
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,500
So it's got the geography, it's got the labor, it's got the demand—seemingly all

204
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:56,980
the pieces are in place for an economic explosion, except for, critically, a plan.

205
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
President López Obrador and the federal government have been largely absent in the industrial

206
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
sector.

207
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Most of the work to actually attract and incentivize the manufacturing industry has occurred on

208
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,840
a state level.

209
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,720
States like Nuevo León have long focused on developing their manufacturing industries—building

210
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,840
industrial parks, offering financial incentives, coordinating with incoming manufacturers—and

211
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,480
it's worked.

212
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,640
Despite sitting number seven in terms of population, Nuevo León is third on GDP, beaten only by

213
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,120
Mexico City and the state that surrounds it.

214
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,780
That means the state's per capita GDP is similar to that of Malaysia or Greece, and

215
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:35,340
Nuevo León is generally one of the safest Mexican states, on par with many areas in

216
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,360
the US.

217
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,260
For all these reasons, Monterey has become the country's second largest center of wealth,

218
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,680
after the capital, featuring the tallest skyscraper in Latin America, one of the most modern metro

219
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,140
systems in North America, and a dazzling array of upscale hotels and restaurants.

220
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,060
Other northern Mexican states have followed suit, working to develop their own US-focused

221
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,140
manufacturing industries, but still, inextricably, the country's current leadership fails to

222
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,680
grasp the opportunity of the moment.

223
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,680
The President has been widely criticized for his lack of focus on the country's industrial

224
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,440
sector during what could turn out to be its most pivotal years.

225
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,600
In fairness, though, he's been focused on fighting crime.

226
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,880
This is justified—the country is experiencing a crippling wave of violence that has pushed

227
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,360
its homicide rate up to the eighth highest in the world, but he's still been largely

228
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,840
ineffective at blunting it.

229
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,820
The US is also worried about crime in Mexico because of its downstream effect.

230
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,020
Republicans surveyed ahead of the 2022 US midterms indicated that immigration was their

231
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,460
number two issue, behind only the economy.

232
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,140
American conservatives in particular are worried about the exceptional number of migrants crossing

233
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,500
the US-Mexico border through both official and unofficial channels, and a major impetus

234
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
of this surge is violence.

235
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,700
Of course, taking it back one step further, a major impetus of violence is poverty—that's

236
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,080
a relationship that academics have established time and time again, and poverty is also a

237
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,360
driver of immigration itself.

238
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,240
Therefore, you improve the economy, you improve the violence, you reduce the volume of immigrants

239
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
at the border.

240
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,800
Mexican manufacturing is rarely taking the place of American manufacturing these days.

241
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,240
Rather, it's taking the place of Chinese manufacturing, so it's trading a distant

242
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,600
country with a dubious record respecting human rights and intellectual property for a culturally

243
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,140
and politically-allied neighbor.

244
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,440
This serves the US's global goals, and then on top of that, the economic boon the phenomenon

245
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,040
spurs helps solve other American goals.

246
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,780
It is, through and through, a virtuous cycle, so the only shame is that Mexican and American

247
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,200
federal authorities have yet to fully recognize that.

248
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,600
The industry can be a solution to the problems that officials on both sides say they need

249
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,820
to focus on first, but unfortunately, there's been a long history on both sides of attacking

250
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,960
symptoms rather than actual causes.

251
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:56,020
Mexico is already a powerhouse, middle-income industrial economy with incredible geography

252
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,840
and an enormous educated labor pool, and it seems like it's finally getting some of

253
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,940
the economic expansion it deserves, but this has largely happened in spite of ineffective

254
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,860
infrastructure, in spite of crippling violence, in spite of a complacent government, in spite

255
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,420
of so many constraints.

256
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:19,840
So a future where Mexican manufacturing grows thanks to something is tantalizing.

257
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:25,600
Just imagine a future where Mexico recognizes potential as strongly as China did four decades

258
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,700
ago.

259
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,420
Some of the most important issues of the moment are also some of the most politicized ones,

260
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,400
and media organizations play a part in shaping that reality.

261
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,720
Advertising revenue is driven by clicks, clicks are driven by emotion, and emotion is driven

262
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,920
by appealing to what people care about most—that's a big reason why media outlets are more biased

263
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,080
than ever.

264
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,700
We actually made a whole video about this exact issue, and it's something I encountered

265
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,980
with this video when trying to get accurate information about just how significant the

266
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,820
current surge in immigration is.

267
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,780
But the fix that I turn to is our sponsor, Ground News.

268
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:03,280
It's kind of an amazing concept—each day they process nearly 60,000 news articles and

269
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,240
aggregate multiple stories on the same subject from multiple outlets and give you a sense

270
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,740
of the political bias and factual record of each source.

271
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,880
This way you get an idea of how the same reality gets portrayed differently depending on who's

272
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,240
writing about it.

273
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,100
Another feature I love is Blindspot.

274
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,100
It shows you these stories that the other side of the political spectrum is talking

275
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,940
about, but that you likely haven't heard about given the political bias of your media

276
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:29,440
diet—helping address the very issue with partisan-based clickbait I mentioned earlier.

277
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,860
You can see exactly what conservatives and liberals are seeing in real time.

278
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:38,740
This story about a possible export restriction to China only has a 15% left-leaning coverage,

279
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,820
while this story about Chinese reports on Indian borders has no right-leaning coverage.

280
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,120
Ground News has really come to be a crucial research tool for making our videos, and it's

281
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,540
also become one of my favorite ways to consume the news, as I want to make sure that I'm

282
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,140
using that time to actually learn about the world—not just to make myself feel good

283
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,860
by reading stories designed to feed my own political bias.
