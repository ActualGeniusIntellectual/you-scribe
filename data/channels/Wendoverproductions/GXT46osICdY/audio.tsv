0	6760	At 12.01 am, on July 6th, 2018, this short line was added to chapter 99 of the Harmonized
6760	9460	Tariff Schedule of the United States.
9460	13660	With that, new pneumatic tires, of rubber, of a kind use on aircraft, parts of stock
13660	18160	pumps imported for use with machines for making cellulosic pulp, paper, or cardboard, machines
18160	22480	for mixing mineral substances with bitumen, spherical roller bearings, lithium primary
22480	28480	cells and primary batteries, fuses for a voltage not exceeding 1,000 volts, and some 278 other
28480	34460	products would now be subject to a 25% import tax when coming from China to the US.
34460	39620	This small tweak, and the $36 billion of goods it would impact, was the first volley and
39620	43760	would later be known as the US-China trade war.
43760	45660	The next rounds came quick.
45660	49540	Just weeks after, the Trump administration initiated a smaller second package covering
49540	55560	some $16 billion in goods, then in September, after a Chinese response, an absolutely massive
55560	60160	package of 10% tariffs on some $200 billion.
60160	66160	Finally, after further Chinese action, these rates were raised to a crippling 25%.
66160	72500	Now, a Chinese-made space heater that might have sold for $48 would cost $60, or more
72500	76960	likely, a US distributor would look for suppliers from other, non-tariffed countries so that
76960	80160	they could get prices back down to $48.
80160	85320	The ultimate net effect of this was an 8.5% reduction in trade from China to the US, and
85320	88740	a 26.3% decline in the reverse.
88740	94380	But perhaps more relevantly, this spat dethroned China from its perch atop the list of US trading
94380	95620	partners.
95620	100420	Now ranking higher was Canada, in the second spot, and Mexico, as the new largest.
100420	105900	But the trade war would be far from the end of issues keeping China from the top.
105900	110760	The next emerged not out of Washington, of course, but from Wuhan.
110760	114660	After the headlines were dominated by the news of a mystery novel coronavirus in China,
114660	118880	then by COVID's global spread, then by the world's descent into lockdown, then by breakneck
118880	123360	vaccine development, then by the shot's wide-scale rollout across the developed world,
123360	128840	summer 2021's headlines were dominated by supply chain chaos.
128840	132800	Armed with lockdown savings but still facing barriers to spending them on restaurants,
132800	139000	concerts, and plane tickets, American consumers started buying lots and lots of things—physical,
139000	140360	real-world products.
140580	145140	COVID, however, was still exerting influence, meaning dockworkers and truck drivers in California
145140	149700	were still getting sick, while their counterparts in China, Vietnam, or India were still largely
149700	154060	unvaccinated or vaccinated with less effective shots, meaning stricter social distancing
154060	159140	and lockdown restrictions were still in place, blunting shipping, and manufacturing itself.
159140	162020	The net effect was what made it to the headlines.
162020	165260	Factories struggled to produce fast enough, ships sat offshore for weeks waiting to get
165260	171200	them loaded, American store shelves sat empty as stock simply could not come fast enough.
171200	175600	By late 2022 the Trans-Pacific Capacity Crunch had largely dissipated, supply and demand
175600	180480	had equalized, and container rates had nearly returned to 2019 levels, but supply chains
180480	185360	were never able to fully repair as Russia's invasion of Ukraine wreaked havoc on global
185360	186360	trade.
186360	190640	Sanctions cut off supply to key metals, energy and food costs rose globally, and marine and
190640	194360	air cargo was rerouted to avoid the belligerent nation.
194460	199380	Meanwhile, today's China is certainly not the China it used to be.
199380	203860	While perhaps a truism, up until recently, rapid economic development was the decades-long
203860	207060	norm, but the nation's now entered a new era.
207060	211960	In the most concise narrative, one single factor is attributed as the ultimate source
211960	217580	of China's unprecedented economic ascent—low-cost manufacturing.
217580	221440	China was a place where foreign firms could effectively offshore manufacturing and save
221440	225640	massively through low labor costs, but in many ways, the country's industrial sector
225640	228340	became a victim of its own success.
228340	233480	In twenty years, the nation's GDP per capita rose ten times, and with that, quality of
233480	236220	life improved massively.
236220	240180	Major Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, or Shenzhen started featuring the same shops,
240180	244820	restaurants, and hotels as Tokyo, London, or New York, the luxury goods market exploded
244820	248820	as an unprecedented number of millionaires and billionaires were minted, and a genuine
248820	253160	middle class developed, living a similar quality of life as those in the US, Europe,
253160	255200	or any developed nation.
255200	259520	But to the outside, to the companies that had previously offshored to China, this increase
259520	264680	in purchasing power meant a dollar didn't go as far anymore within the People's Republic.
264680	269560	Wages rose, and so too, in step, did manufacturing costs.
269560	273500	The peak of inbound foreign direct investment to China has long passed as multinational
273500	277400	enterprises have now focused elsewhere for their lowest-cost manufacturing, but this
277400	281060	was of little concern to the nation, as they were able to parlay the wealth generated from
281060	286380	this era into developing an impressive array of home-grown businesses.
286380	291300	There are behemoth e-commerce platforms like JD.com and Alibaba, sprawling tech conglomerates
291300	296660	like Tencent and Huawei, unicorn startups like DJI and Didi, even the first non-American
296660	301980	social media platform to attain global mainstream adoption with ByteDance's TikTok.
301980	303940	But TikTok is a rare exception.
303960	308800	Overwhelmingly, the business China does with America is not through services—it's with
308800	310900	physical products.
310900	314640	Physical products need to physically travel to the American end consumer, but the problem
314640	319880	that's now coming into focus is that America is really, really far from China.
319880	323720	Shanghai is the world's busiest container port, while the combination of Los Angeles
323720	328360	and Long Beach is the US's, so trips between the two are about as common as they come,
328360	330120	but they're no small feat.
330780	334400	For the moment the Chinese coast disappears behind, a vessel won't see Los Angeles for
334400	339060	another 18 days, assuming everything goes right, which it often does not.
339060	343300	Even with massive improvements since 2021's supply chain chaos, major container carriers
343300	347340	only range between 50 and 60% schedule reliability.
347340	352260	Offshoring, just-in-time manufacturing, and even globalization itself are all terms and
352260	355300	phenomenons that largely developed in the past 30 years.
355300	359820	In fact, some experts consider the fall of the Berlin Wall as the start of the era of
359840	364560	peak globalization, but this era might, in retrospect, be considered bookended by the
364560	368080	trade war, COVID, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
368080	371840	The world has returned to a more fractured state, and it's worth remembering that prior
371840	376220	to this conflict, Russia's relationship with Europe and the US was not all that different
376220	378420	from China's today.
378420	381880	Diplomatic relations are maintained, but they're tense.
381880	385520	Certain respected Western leaders now speak of conflict with China, likely spurred by
385520	387560	an invasion of Taiwan, as inevitable.
388100	393220	So that's to say, the world is already less globalized than it was in 2017, and there
393220	397380	are certain, concerningly possible events that would make a trade war, COVID, and the
397380	400940	Russian invasion of Ukraine look like warm-up laps.
400940	406980	So, 2023, in the world of logistics, is marked by a consolidation of concerns.
406980	411460	COVID and Ukraine expose the vulnerabilities, and there's widespread concern that these
411460	413820	could only be the start.
413820	417800	The consensus, therefore, is that there are essentially two options.
417800	421680	One can fortify the globalized supply chain through building more slack in the system,
421680	425680	ordering components earlier, keeping more in stock, manufacturing the inventory earlier,
425680	430320	but this comes with a very real, surprisingly significant cost.
430320	434800	The other option is to remove the risk—remove the physical and political gulf between the
434800	441040	manufacturer and the market—and this option has proved surprisingly popular.
441040	443460	All that's needed is an alternative.
443460	447800	One developing country on the other side of the Pacific where wages are low and the workforce
447800	448800	is large.
448800	452360	A country like Mexico.
452360	455720	From a manufacturer's point of view, Mexico's not perfect.
455720	461640	Of 180 countries ranked by the Corruption Perception Index, Mexico comes in at 128th.
461640	466240	Of the 190 ranked by ease of doing business, Mexico ranks 60th.
466240	470280	Of the world's 50 busiest seaports, Mexico is home to none.
470280	474900	Mexico's largest, the port of Manzanillo, outpaced nearly six times over by that of
474900	477140	Los Angeles and Long Beach.
477140	480220	Further complicating things, it's hard to get around Mexico.
480220	484320	The jagged Sierra Madre ranges run from the country's northwest to its southeast, harsh
484320	489420	deserts define much of the country's north, and dense forestry covers much of its south.
489420	493220	The roads, rails, and bridges that cross these mountain ranges and cut through desert and
493220	498540	forest alike, well, Mexican infrastructure is getting better, but it still lags far behind
498540	499700	China's.
499700	503860	With complicated perceptions, outdated assumptions, and difficult internal transportation networks
503860	510320	aside, Mexico is blessed with one simple geographic gift that no country other than Canada can
510320	515280	lay claim to—it shares a border with the world's largest economy.
515280	519940	While the Rio Grande River isn't actually navigable, it's home to one of North America's
519940	521920	most valuable ports.
521920	526380	Connecting Texas and the Mexican state of Nuevo León is the World Trade International
526380	527380	Bridge.
527380	531980	Strictly commercial, eight lanes wide, it sees over 6,000 northbound trucks cross it
531980	537780	every single day, and since its construction in 2000, it has never been busier.
537780	542500	As of 2022, the inland port ranks first among American points of entry in trade value, and
542500	546740	all this increased importance in stacking traffic is by and large due to what manufacturing
546740	551860	in northern Mexico has to offer that China simply can't—speed and flexibility at
551860	553820	low cost.
553820	558720	About 150 miles, or 250 kilometers, down Mexico's Highway 85, and just outside the
558720	563340	small city of Salinas, Victoria, is this—a barren dirt lot.
563340	566760	Except, it's not actually a barren dirt lot.
566760	572120	This is Hofusan Industrial Park, a 200-acre complex constructed by a private Chinese-Mexican
572120	574980	partnership designed to pull in Chinese manufacturers.
574980	580220	It's so new, with construction beginning in 2017, that satellite maps have yet to capture
580220	581220	development.
581220	582700	But it's there.
582700	584260	And it's bold.
584260	588980	The master plan is to lure over 100 Chinese manufacturers to the gated park, build out
588980	593220	a residential area to house employees, and establish a host of services, from Chinese
593220	595420	restaurants to hotels and hospitals.
595420	600220	The idea is to build out a little slice of China where labor is stable and Chinese executives
600220	603140	and operators can feel somewhat at home.
603140	607900	With much of the land still resembling a construction site six years in, this sparkling master plan
607900	610160	is far from a reality.
610160	612100	But it is trending in the right direction.
612100	615600	In my sense, an electronics manufacturer has made the move.
615600	619820	So too have furniture makers Kuka Home, Sunan, and Manhua.
619820	626640	And neighboring them are more Chinese manufacturers—Fower, Skyish, Asenstar, Bell & Turf have all bought
626640	628260	into the project.
628260	631940	The incentives, especially since the opening of the trade war that's made manufacturing
631940	636260	in Mexico more cost-competitive, are just too strong.
636260	639940	Even without the restaurant, shops, and housing that's supposed to make the move more appealing
639940	644220	and the transition smoother, Chinese companies are taking the leap—inside the gates of
644220	647300	Hafezon Park and outside them too.
647300	651260	The tech company Lenovo, for instance, has been manufacturing just outside of Monterey
651260	652660	for over a decade.
652660	658900	And in 2022 alone, 44 separate Asian companies opened new manufacturing spaces in Mexico,
658900	663860	with 9 of the 10 largest being Chinese-owned and 7 of them opening in the state of Nuevo
663860	664860	Leon.
664860	669580	Zooming out from the state, this is a graph of Chinese investment in Mexico—this skyward
669620	673700	trajectory of investment is simply unmistakable.
673700	679940	While concerns over security and capable infrastructure still loom, the deal is too good to wait on.
679940	685140	Of course, a few dozen companies relocating across a decade-plus doesn't necessarily
685140	690060	in itself signal the rise of Mexico as the world's factory, or that China's relinquishing
690060	693860	the role, or that this is the end of offshoring as we know it.
693860	696220	Right now, the sample size is small.
696740	701020	But the reasons companies are moving to Mexico aren't going away, and the appeal of manufacturing
701020	703380	in Mexico extends beyond China.
703380	708300	While China might be new to northern Mexico, Japan isn't, South Korea isn't, and the
708300	709820	US isn't.
709820	715340	To industrial manufacturers, the region's value has been well understood for decades.
715340	719180	Years before the establishment of NAFTA, Mexico worked to maximize the appeal of its lower
719180	724140	costs of labor and proximity to the US by setting up the Machia Dora system—essentially,
724140	727780	low-cost, tax-advantaged factories owned by foreign companies that state officials
727780	731020	hoped would tamp down unemployment and entice foreign investment.
731020	736380	With the arrival of free trade agreements, these factories exploded in number.
736380	741380	Northern Mexico first experienced the invigorating arrival of auto companies like Kia, Toyota,
741380	744420	BMW, Ford, and Audi, among others.
744420	750040	Then came the rest as Lego, Samsung, LG, 3M, GE, and countless other recognizable brands
750040	751660	moved into the region.
751660	756420	Their collective arrival transformed the Mexican economy—in a 2012 analysis of Machia
756420	762340	Dora's, some 5,055 existed across the country, mostly in the north, and the factories employed
762340	765340	just over 2 million Mexicans.
765340	769080	The value of these turnkey factories persists too, as they help to counter narratives of
769080	774040	Mexican states being too dangerous and unpredictable for business to places ripe and ready to establish
774040	777820	a new manufacturing hub for companies spanning the globe.
777820	782800	What Mexico has had to offer in recent decades has proven too good to pass up on.
782800	787280	The factories already exist, the wages, though higher than some Eastern developing countries,
787280	791320	are low, and by being here, not only are tariffs now out of the picture, but companies are
791320	795960	also relocating to a Western business environment where patent and IP production is stronger,
795960	800640	political risk is lower, and the negative optics of offshoring are minimized.
800640	805700	Simply put, beyond what's pushing Chinese manufacturers abroad, Mexico itself has developed
805700	807800	tremendous pull.
807800	812140	Automotive and electronic manufacturers from the world over made northern Mexico a home
812140	816540	away from home decades ago, fundamentally transforming the Mexican economy and creating
816540	821820	a mutually beneficial system for the country and company that shows few signs of slowing.
821820	825300	China's simply the most recent to recognize the profound appeal.
825300	830500	So it's got the geography, it's got the labor, it's got the demand—seemingly all
830500	836980	the pieces are in place for an economic explosion, except for, critically, a plan.
837200	841200	President López Obrador and the federal government have been largely absent in the industrial
841200	842200	sector.
842200	846200	Most of the work to actually attract and incentivize the manufacturing industry has occurred on
846200	847840	a state level.
847840	852720	States like Nuevo León have long focused on developing their manufacturing industries—building
852720	856840	industrial parks, offering financial incentives, coordinating with incoming manufacturers—and
856840	858480	it's worked.
858480	863640	Despite sitting number seven in terms of population, Nuevo León is third on GDP, beaten only by
863640	866120	Mexico City and the state that surrounds it.
866140	870780	That means the state's per capita GDP is similar to that of Malaysia or Greece, and
870780	875340	Nuevo León is generally one of the safest Mexican states, on par with many areas in
875340	876360	the US.
876360	881260	For all these reasons, Monterey has become the country's second largest center of wealth,
881260	885680	after the capital, featuring the tallest skyscraper in Latin America, one of the most modern metro
885680	891140	systems in North America, and a dazzling array of upscale hotels and restaurants.
891140	895060	Other northern Mexican states have followed suit, working to develop their own US-focused
895080	900140	manufacturing industries, but still, inextricably, the country's current leadership fails to
900140	902680	grasp the opportunity of the moment.
902680	906680	The President has been widely criticized for his lack of focus on the country's industrial
906680	910440	sector during what could turn out to be its most pivotal years.
910440	913600	In fairness, though, he's been focused on fighting crime.
913600	917880	This is justified—the country is experiencing a crippling wave of violence that has pushed
917880	922360	its homicide rate up to the eighth highest in the world, but he's still been largely
922360	924840	ineffective at blunting it.
924840	929820	The US is also worried about crime in Mexico because of its downstream effect.
929820	934020	Republicans surveyed ahead of the 2022 US midterms indicated that immigration was their
934020	937460	number two issue, behind only the economy.
937460	941140	American conservatives in particular are worried about the exceptional number of migrants crossing
941140	945500	the US-Mexico border through both official and unofficial channels, and a major impetus
945500	947500	of this surge is violence.
947500	952700	Of course, taking it back one step further, a major impetus of violence is poverty—that's
952700	957080	a relationship that academics have established time and time again, and poverty is also a
957080	959360	driver of immigration itself.
959360	964240	Therefore, you improve the economy, you improve the violence, you reduce the volume of immigrants
964240	965920	at the border.
965920	969800	Mexican manufacturing is rarely taking the place of American manufacturing these days.
969800	974240	Rather, it's taking the place of Chinese manufacturing, so it's trading a distant
974240	978600	country with a dubious record respecting human rights and intellectual property for a culturally
978600	981140	and politically-allied neighbor.
981160	985440	This serves the US's global goals, and then on top of that, the economic boon the phenomenon
985440	988040	spurs helps solve other American goals.
988040	993780	It is, through and through, a virtuous cycle, so the only shame is that Mexican and American
993780	997200	federal authorities have yet to fully recognize that.
997200	1001600	The industry can be a solution to the problems that officials on both sides say they need
1001600	1006820	to focus on first, but unfortunately, there's been a long history on both sides of attacking
1006820	1010960	symptoms rather than actual causes.
1010960	1016020	Mexico is already a powerhouse, middle-income industrial economy with incredible geography
1016020	1019840	and an enormous educated labor pool, and it seems like it's finally getting some of
1019840	1024940	the economic expansion it deserves, but this has largely happened in spite of ineffective
1024940	1030860	infrastructure, in spite of crippling violence, in spite of a complacent government, in spite
1030860	1032420	of so many constraints.
1032420	1039840	So a future where Mexican manufacturing grows thanks to something is tantalizing.
1039840	1045600	Just imagine a future where Mexico recognizes potential as strongly as China did four decades
1045600	1047700	ago.
1047700	1051420	Some of the most important issues of the moment are also some of the most politicized ones,
1051420	1055400	and media organizations play a part in shaping that reality.
1055400	1058720	Advertising revenue is driven by clicks, clicks are driven by emotion, and emotion is driven
1058720	1063920	by appealing to what people care about most—that's a big reason why media outlets are more biased
1063920	1065080	than ever.
1065080	1068700	We actually made a whole video about this exact issue, and it's something I encountered
1068700	1071980	with this video when trying to get accurate information about just how significant the
1071980	1073820	current surge in immigration is.
1073820	1077780	But the fix that I turn to is our sponsor, Ground News.
1077780	1083280	It's kind of an amazing concept—each day they process nearly 60,000 news articles and
1083280	1087240	aggregate multiple stories on the same subject from multiple outlets and give you a sense
1087240	1090740	of the political bias and factual record of each source.
1090740	1094880	This way you get an idea of how the same reality gets portrayed differently depending on who's
1094880	1096240	writing about it.
1096240	1098100	Another feature I love is Blindspot.
1098100	1101100	It shows you these stories that the other side of the political spectrum is talking
1101100	1104940	about, but that you likely haven't heard about given the political bias of your media
1104940	1109440	diet—helping address the very issue with partisan-based clickbait I mentioned earlier.
1109440	1113860	You can see exactly what conservatives and liberals are seeing in real time.
1113860	1118740	This story about a possible export restriction to China only has a 15% left-leaning coverage,
1118740	1123820	while this story about Chinese reports on Indian borders has no right-leaning coverage.
1123820	1128120	Ground News has really come to be a crucial research tool for making our videos, and it's
1128120	1131540	also become one of my favorite ways to consume the news, as I want to make sure that I'm
1131540	1135140	using that time to actually learn about the world—not just to make myself feel good
1135140	1137860	by reading stories designed to feed my own political bias.
1137860	1142220	So if you want to add this crucial bias-correcting layer to your media diet, click the button
