0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13380	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13380	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21060	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21060	25580	bit more about our amazing world.
25580	27460	Maps are very hard to make.
27460	32280	To create a map from scratch, one has to do years of field work or analyzation of satellite
32280	36620	photos so plagiarism has always been rampant among map makers.
36620	42040	It's pretty easy just to redraw the same geographical features from one map onto a
42040	44520	new map and it's hard to get caught.
44520	47580	You are, after all, drawing the exact same world.
47580	53080	So map makers came up with a way to catch individuals stealing their data.
53080	56240	This is Argleton in West Lancashire, England.
56240	60560	According to a 2009 screenshot of Google Maps, Argleton is a town.
60560	65900	It's supposedly located between Aten to the south and Ormskirk to the north.
65900	70160	The problem is, if you go to this site, this is what you find.
70160	74020	Argleton was placed on the map as a paper town.
74020	78800	Paper towns are fake places that are put on maps as copyright traps.
78800	83780	A map maker can make up a place and if they see that a competing map maker also has that
83780	89020	town on their maps, they know that at one point the competitor plagiarized their info.
89020	93060	So in Argleton's case, the town probably wasn't placed there by Google.
93060	97980	Google gets their data from TeleAtlas who sources their data from other mapping companies,
97980	102100	who in turn gets some of their data from other mapping companies.
102100	106780	Somewhere down the line, someone must have placed Argleton on the map as a trap and its
106780	110580	presence on Google Maps was just a remnant of that.
110580	115300	After the fake town gained widespread media attention, Google removed it from their map
115300	120900	and it has since been replaced with a marker designating the spot as a ghost town.
120900	123860	There are hundreds of other examples of paper towns.
123860	129180	In New York, a spot north of Roscoe, New York was marked as the town of Aglo by the General
129180	131540	Drafting Company in 1930.
131540	136380	The name came from an anagram of the cartographer's initials and appeared on numerous maps since
136380	137800	its conception.
137800	142800	In the 1960s, Aglo showed up on a Rand McNally map of the region and, thinking that they
142800	147760	had fallen into their trap, Esso, who had bought the map from the General Drafting Company,
147760	149880	threatened to sue McNally.
149880	154720	The suit was dropped, though, when Rand McNally pointed that Aglo had actually become a real
154720	155800	place.
155800	161160	Sometime in the 1950s, locals opened up a general store north of Roscoe, New York and,
161160	165680	after looking at an Esso map of the region, decided to call their store the Aglo General
165680	170000	Storeâ€”therefore making Aglo an official place.
170000	173400	The store eventually went out of business and the town is since disappeared from most
173400	177700	maps, but this is one instance where a fake town became real.
177700	181940	A similar idea to paper towns has been used in other domains.
181940	187560	In 2001, the word asquivalence appeared in the New Oxford American Dictionary defined
187560	192320	as the willful avoidance of one's official responsibilities.
192320	196920	That word was made up as a copyright trap and it actually worked.
196920	201640	Dictionary.com and Google's dictionary both added a listing for the word asquivalence,
201640	206600	possibly proving a level of plagiarism among the online dictionaries.
206600	212160	Occasionally, unintentional traps are created that prove effective.
212160	217760	Before they created Apple Maps, Apple was making maps on a much smaller scale for iPhoto.
217760	221680	These maps had no attributions and therefore no one could be sure where their data was
221680	225080	from, but there were some obvious clues.
225080	229660	This screenshot of Apple's map of Norweg shows an area of disorganized roads in the
229660	231100	northeast.
231100	235320	If you look at the OpenStreetMap map of the area, you can see that these roads are actually
235320	237280	trails in a park.
237280	241680	Overlaying the Apple map over the OSM map of the area, you can see how perfectly the
241680	244520	supposed roads and trails line up.
244520	248960	You can assume from this that Apple took their map data from OpenStreetMap and mistook the
248960	250860	trails for roads.
250860	255980	A few months after the release, Apple officially credited OpenStreetMap for their contributions
255980	261160	to the maps, confirming that they used OSM's data.
261160	262300	So those are paper towns.
262300	264140	I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.
264140	267660	I'll be back next week to bring you more from that Wikipedia list.
