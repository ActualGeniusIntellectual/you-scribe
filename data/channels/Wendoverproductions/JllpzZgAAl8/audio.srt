00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,580
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,460
Maps are very hard to make.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,280
To create a map from scratch, one has to do years of field work or analyzation of satellite

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:36,620
photos so plagiarism has always been rampant among map makers.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,040
It's pretty easy just to redraw the same geographical features from one map onto a

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,520
new map and it's hard to get caught.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,580
You are, after all, drawing the exact same world.

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,080
So map makers came up with a way to catch individuals stealing their data.

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,240
This is Argleton in West Lancashire, England.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,560
According to a 2009 screenshot of Google Maps, Argleton is a town.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,900
It's supposedly located between Aten to the south and Ormskirk to the north.

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,160
The problem is, if you go to this site, this is what you find.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,020
Argleton was placed on the map as a paper town.

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,800
Paper towns are fake places that are put on maps as copyright traps.

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,780
A map maker can make up a place and if they see that a competing map maker also has that

23
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,020
town on their maps, they know that at one point the competitor plagiarized their info.

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:33,060
So in Argleton's case, the town probably wasn't placed there by Google.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,980
Google gets their data from TeleAtlas who sources their data from other mapping companies,

26
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:42,100
who in turn gets some of their data from other mapping companies.

27
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,780
Somewhere down the line, someone must have placed Argleton on the map as a trap and its

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,580
presence on Google Maps was just a remnant of that.

29
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,300
After the fake town gained widespread media attention, Google removed it from their map

30
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,900
and it has since been replaced with a marker designating the spot as a ghost town.

31
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,860
There are hundreds of other examples of paper towns.

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:09,180
In New York, a spot north of Roscoe, New York was marked as the town of Aglo by the General

33
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,540
Drafting Company in 1930.

34
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,380
The name came from an anagram of the cartographer's initials and appeared on numerous maps since

35
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,800
its conception.

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,800
In the 1960s, Aglo showed up on a Rand McNally map of the region and, thinking that they

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,760
had fallen into their trap, Esso, who had bought the map from the General Drafting Company,

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,880
threatened to sue McNally.

39
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,720
The suit was dropped, though, when Rand McNally pointed that Aglo had actually become a real

40
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,800
place.

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:41,160
Sometime in the 1950s, locals opened up a general store north of Roscoe, New York and,

42
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,680
after looking at an Esso map of the region, decided to call their store the Aglo General

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
Storeâ€”therefore making Aglo an official place.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,400
The store eventually went out of business and the town is since disappeared from most

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,700
maps, but this is one instance where a fake town became real.

46
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,940
A similar idea to paper towns has been used in other domains.

47
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:07,560
In 2001, the word asquivalence appeared in the New Oxford American Dictionary defined

48
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,320
as the willful avoidance of one's official responsibilities.

49
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,920
That word was made up as a copyright trap and it actually worked.

50
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,640
Dictionary.com and Google's dictionary both added a listing for the word asquivalence,

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,600
possibly proving a level of plagiarism among the online dictionaries.

52
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,160
Occasionally, unintentional traps are created that prove effective.

53
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,760
Before they created Apple Maps, Apple was making maps on a much smaller scale for iPhoto.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,680
These maps had no attributions and therefore no one could be sure where their data was

55
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,080
from, but there were some obvious clues.

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,660
This screenshot of Apple's map of Norweg shows an area of disorganized roads in the

57
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,100
northeast.

58
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,320
If you look at the OpenStreetMap map of the area, you can see that these roads are actually

59
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,280
trails in a park.

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,680
Overlaying the Apple map over the OSM map of the area, you can see how perfectly the

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,520
supposed roads and trails line up.

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,960
You can assume from this that Apple took their map data from OpenStreetMap and mistook the

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,860
trails for roads.

64
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,980
A few months after the release, Apple officially credited OpenStreetMap for their contributions

65
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,160
to the maps, confirming that they used OSM's data.

66
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,300
So those are paper towns.

67
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,140
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.

68
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,660
I'll be back next week to bring you more from that Wikipedia list.
