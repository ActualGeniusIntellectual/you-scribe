00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.380 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.060 --> 00:25.580
bit more about our amazing world.

00:25.580 --> 00:27.460
Maps are very hard to make.

00:27.460 --> 00:32.280
To create a map from scratch, one has to do years of field work or analyzation of satellite

00:32.280 --> 00:36.620
photos so plagiarism has always been rampant among map makers.

00:36.620 --> 00:42.040
It's pretty easy just to redraw the same geographical features from one map onto a

00:42.040 --> 00:44.520
new map and it's hard to get caught.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.580
You are, after all, drawing the exact same world.

00:47.580 --> 00:53.080
So map makers came up with a way to catch individuals stealing their data.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.240
This is Argleton in West Lancashire, England.

00:56.240 --> 01:00.560
According to a 2009 screenshot of Google Maps, Argleton is a town.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.900
It's supposedly located between Aten to the south and Ormskirk to the north.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.160
The problem is, if you go to this site, this is what you find.

01:10.160 --> 01:14.020
Argleton was placed on the map as a paper town.

01:14.020 --> 01:18.800
Paper towns are fake places that are put on maps as copyright traps.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.780
A map maker can make up a place and if they see that a competing map maker also has that

01:23.780 --> 01:29.020
town on their maps, they know that at one point the competitor plagiarized their info.

01:29.020 --> 01:33.060
So in Argleton's case, the town probably wasn't placed there by Google.

01:33.060 --> 01:37.980
Google gets their data from TeleAtlas who sources their data from other mapping companies,

01:37.980 --> 01:42.100
who in turn gets some of their data from other mapping companies.

01:42.100 --> 01:46.780
Somewhere down the line, someone must have placed Argleton on the map as a trap and its

01:46.780 --> 01:50.580
presence on Google Maps was just a remnant of that.

01:50.580 --> 01:55.300
After the fake town gained widespread media attention, Google removed it from their map

01:55.300 --> 02:00.900
and it has since been replaced with a marker designating the spot as a ghost town.

02:00.900 --> 02:03.860
There are hundreds of other examples of paper towns.

02:03.860 --> 02:09.180
In New York, a spot north of Roscoe, New York was marked as the town of Aglo by the General

02:09.180 --> 02:11.540
Drafting Company in 1930.

02:11.540 --> 02:16.380
The name came from an anagram of the cartographer's initials and appeared on numerous maps since

02:16.380 --> 02:17.800
its conception.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.800
In the 1960s, Aglo showed up on a Rand McNally map of the region and, thinking that they

02:22.800 --> 02:27.760
had fallen into their trap, Esso, who had bought the map from the General Drafting Company,

02:27.760 --> 02:29.880
threatened to sue McNally.

02:29.880 --> 02:34.720
The suit was dropped, though, when Rand McNally pointed that Aglo had actually become a real

02:34.720 --> 02:35.800
place.

02:35.800 --> 02:41.160
Sometime in the 1950s, locals opened up a general store north of Roscoe, New York and,

02:41.160 --> 02:45.680
after looking at an Esso map of the region, decided to call their store the Aglo General

02:45.680 --> 02:50.000
Storeâ€”therefore making Aglo an official place.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.400
The store eventually went out of business and the town is since disappeared from most

02:53.400 --> 02:57.700
maps, but this is one instance where a fake town became real.

02:57.700 --> 03:01.940
A similar idea to paper towns has been used in other domains.

03:01.940 --> 03:07.560
In 2001, the word asquivalence appeared in the New Oxford American Dictionary defined

03:07.560 --> 03:12.320
as the willful avoidance of one's official responsibilities.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.920
That word was made up as a copyright trap and it actually worked.

03:16.920 --> 03:21.640
Dictionary.com and Google's dictionary both added a listing for the word asquivalence,

03:21.640 --> 03:26.600
possibly proving a level of plagiarism among the online dictionaries.

03:26.600 --> 03:32.160
Occasionally, unintentional traps are created that prove effective.

03:32.160 --> 03:37.760
Before they created Apple Maps, Apple was making maps on a much smaller scale for iPhoto.

03:37.760 --> 03:41.680
These maps had no attributions and therefore no one could be sure where their data was

03:41.680 --> 03:45.080
from, but there were some obvious clues.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.660
This screenshot of Apple's map of Norweg shows an area of disorganized roads in the

03:49.660 --> 03:51.100
northeast.

03:51.100 --> 03:55.320
If you look at the OpenStreetMap map of the area, you can see that these roads are actually

03:55.320 --> 03:57.280
trails in a park.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.680
Overlaying the Apple map over the OSM map of the area, you can see how perfectly the

04:01.680 --> 04:04.520
supposed roads and trails line up.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.960
You can assume from this that Apple took their map data from OpenStreetMap and mistook the

04:08.960 --> 04:10.860
trails for roads.

04:10.860 --> 04:15.980
A few months after the release, Apple officially credited OpenStreetMap for their contributions

04:15.980 --> 04:21.160
to the maps, confirming that they used OSM's data.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.300
So those are paper towns.

04:22.300 --> 04:24.140
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.

04:24.140 --> 04:27.660
I'll be back next week to bring you more from that Wikipedia list.
