13240	19180	The story of supersonic passenger travel is long and tumultuous.
19180	23620	Nearly everyone has heard some version of why Concorde failed.
23620	29040	It was certainly the epitome of a technology ahead of its time, but the true story of why
29080	34640	it failed, or rather, more accurately, why it retired, is more nuanced than the popular
34640	40060	narrative of an overzealous, overly extravagant, inflexible aircraft.
40060	44600	There are degrees to which that narrative is true, but what you don't often hear is
44600	48160	this—Concorde was profitable.
48160	54240	A 747, the flagship of any subsonic fleet during the reign of Concorde, required a gallon
54240	60120	of fuel to carry one passenger 80 miles or one liter for 34 kilometers, assuming a full
60120	61120	load.
61120	67400	Meanwhile, Concorde required roughly one gallon to carry one passenger 17 miles or one liter
67400	72440	per 7 kilometers—clearly a quite decisive difference.
72440	77280	Concorde was vastly less efficient than the aircraft that is today fading away due to
77280	82820	its inefficiency, but the story doesn't end there.
82820	87260	That fuel currently costs about $1.68 per gallon.
87260	93160	Therefore, the fuel bill on a New York to London 747 flight, per passenger, is about
93160	98980	$73.50—not a dramatic amount relative to ticket prices.
98980	105620	Similarly, Concorde, burning about 206 gallons or 780 liters of jet fuel to carry a passenger
105620	110700	across the Atlantic, would burn $346 in fuel.
110700	115540	That's a staggeringly small number compared to its inflation-adjusted ticket price of
115540	119680	roughly $16,000 round trip.
119680	125020	Both Air France and British Airways, the two operators of the aircraft, paid a small sum
125020	129580	for the aircraft relative to its multi-billion dollar development cost, bankrolled by the
129580	132100	French and British governments.
132100	136560	Maintenance and operational costs were certainly high, but certainly not at the level that
136560	140460	some autopsies of the aircraft's demise make them out to be.
140460	145900	So altogether, both airlines were able to turn a tidy profit across the aircraft's
145900	151580	three decades of supersonic service, but there were other issues.
151580	153580	Part of it was versatility.
153580	159100	With a meager 4,500 mile, 7,200 kilometer range, and a brutally loud sonic boom that
159100	163780	forced nearly every government to ban it from flying over the speed of sound over land,
163780	168980	there were very, very few routes on which the aircraft could be used effectively.
169020	174140	Compounding those issues, its seats were sold slightly above first-class prices, around
174140	180220	$16,000 round-trip inflation-adjusted, and there are very, very few routes that can sustain
180220	183460	that level of first-class capacity.
183460	188540	Between EOS, Lavion, MaxJet, SilverJet, British Airways, and others, there's a long history
188540	193940	of airlines attempting to operate all business-class flights between London or Paris and New York,
193940	197900	and yet every single one of these eventually failed.
197900	203280	Concorde essentially involves trying to operate all first-class flights.
203280	209180	For context, in a non-COVID-impacted schedule, British Airways flies a mere 98 first-class
209180	212220	seats between London and New York each day.
212220	218340	With Concorde's double daily New York schedule, British Airways was operating some 200 first-class
218340	223140	seats in addition to dozens more on their regular subsonic services.
223140	228320	That's an enormous amount of first-class capacity that this route, the most valuable
228320	233980	in the world, can't even support today, so it's no surprise that it couldn't decades
233980	234980	ago.
234980	241120	Therefore, many Concorde services operated with more seats empty than full, and yet British
241120	244200	Airways still turned a profit.
244200	249620	Their typical 50-60% load factor worked great from a financial perspective, and some back
249620	254820	of the napkin math estimates that they could have broken even with as little as a 35% load
254820	255820	factor.
255820	260000	In fact, it's possible that they stumbled into the right sales strategy—the one they
260000	265000	had been missing all along—in the aircraft's final days.
265000	269380	After it was announced that Concorde would be retired, but while it was still flying,
269380	274500	British Airways heavily discounted fares, closer to business-class pricing, which increased
274500	282700	load factors dramatically, and yet they turned a $70 million profit—more than they ever
282700	284660	had before.
284660	289640	But many believe that British Airways and Air France weren't seriously trying to make
289640	291800	money with the aircraft.
291800	297980	In the end, its end came as the result of decades of lesser issues colliding with pure,
297980	299620	bad luck.
299620	306420	While taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport on July 25th, 2000, Air France Concorde FBTSC
306420	311420	ran over a piece of engine cowling that a previous departure had lost, blew a tire,
311420	317900	and the ensuing debris ruptured a fuel tank, spilling fuel that ignited within seconds.
317900	322220	One hundred and thirteen lives perished.
322220	327140	This greatly sullied the image of the aircraft that both airlines had been using primarily
327140	331340	as a marketing tool, rather than a true profit center.
331340	335000	Maintenance bills were mounting as Concorde aged, and there were some indications that
335000	340540	first-class services on subsonic British Airways and Air France planes were turning a higher
340540	341540	profit.
341540	345540	Assuming that was true, these airlines would rather have had their passengers fly their
345540	350100	subsonic services—an assertion backed up by the fact that both airlines refused to
350100	354940	sell rather than retire Concorde, worrying that that would lead to losing loyal Concorde
354940	359540	flyers entirely, rather than converting them to subsonic services.
359540	367580	Altogether, the time was right to sunset the world's first supersonic passenger plane.
367580	370260	Two decades have now passed.
370260	374500	With all the progress the world has made in its march through time, some could not accept
374500	378260	a new era bound by mere subsonic travel.
378780	384980	We're now approaching a possible renaissance of supersonic passenger planes, and this time,
384980	388080	it might actually work.
388080	392900	There are three key players in the race to bring back supersonic travel—none of which
392900	398620	are Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, or any other current aircraft manufacturer.
398620	403660	Aerion was founded in 2003, the same year as Concorde's retirement, and has spent
403660	408820	the decade since developing a supersonic private jet, the AS-2.
408820	413760	In the timescale of aircraft development, they're not too far from launch, with production
413760	418540	expected to start in 2023, and a possible launch by 2026.
418540	423100	Boasting financial backing from Boeing, and a partnership with GE for engine development,
423100	427860	Aerion is certainly not in the business of selling pipe dreams.
427860	432620	Operating with a similar business strategy, Spike Aerospace also aims to develop a smaller
432620	434580	supersonic private jet.
434580	440060	Uniquely, they're planning to reduce complexity and increase efficiency by eliminating windows
440060	444820	entirely in the passenger cabin—replacing them with screens displaying high-definition
444820	446860	camera feeds from outside.
446860	451600	Despite its lack of big-name partners and a less slick public appearance, Spike is viewed
451600	456020	as a real contender and is working on a similar timescale to Aerion.
456020	459320	Then, there's Boom Technologies.
459320	464740	If you've heard of any supersonic aircraft developer, this is the one.
464740	470240	Their business model is entirely different—they're not taking the conservative, safer route with
470240	472120	smaller private jets.
472120	474780	They want the whole pie.
474780	479000	They want to be Concorde 2.0.
479000	483040	After emerging from the same powerhouse Silicon Valley accelerator program responsible for
483040	488840	Airbnb, DoorDash, Reddit, and more, they've initially focused their time and funding on
488840	494720	developing a one-person, proof-of-concept supersonic jet, the XB-1, to serve their ultimate
494720	501360	goal of launching a 65-to-88 passenger commercial supersonic jet—the Overture.
501360	508160	Like Aerion, they have some serious partners—Japan Airlines, the US Air Force, Rolls-Royce, and
508160	513180	more—and are viewed as the most ambitious of the three companies, yet potentially the
513180	516440	one with the most attainable goal.
516440	523560	Now, supersonic passenger travel has already existed, even if it doesn't now.
523560	528940	It will not be a technological breakthrough to simply make that happen again.
528940	535000	What will be a breakthrough, if achieved, though, is doing what Concorde could not.
535000	541620	Concorde could not facilitate widespread supersonic travel in a sustainable manner, both economically
541620	543620	and environmentally.
543620	546300	These companies just might.
546300	551060	A good portion of Concorde's issues originated from noise.
551060	557020	You see, a sonic boom is not, as some incorrectly believe, an isolated burst of noise at the
557020	560060	moment a plane reaches the speed of sound.
560060	564880	From the ground it is perceived as an isolated burst of sound, since a plane, and therefore
564880	570320	its shockwaves, are moving, but a sonic boom originates continuously as any object travels
570320	572400	above the speed of sound.
572400	578300	Therefore, if Concorde were to fly from New York to Los Angeles at supersonic speeds,
578300	582640	everyone between the cities would hear the 110 decibel noise.
582640	587720	That's roughly equivalent to the loudness of a chainsaw in your own hands, so it's
587720	594360	no wonder why nearly every country in the world banned supersonic planes over land.
594360	601560	Many believe that, to make supersonic passenger aviation viable, these bans need to end.
601560	606460	Meaning the political will to allow a small number of incredibly wealthy people in supersonic
606460	613120	jets to create such noise pollution is unrealistic, so rather, quite a lot of work is being put
613120	618000	into turning the sonic boom into more of a sonic thump.
618000	622480	While there are a few different techniques being tested, NASA is leading one of the most
622480	627000	concerted efforts to create a low-boom supersonic plane.
627000	632020	They contracted Lockheed Martin to develop the X-59 as part of their Low-Boom Flight
632020	637320	Demonstrator program and, if successful, it will turn the perceived loudness of a sonic
637320	642500	boom from that of a chainsaw to a car door closing.
642500	647160	You see, with Concorde, or essentially any existing supersonic plane, someone on the
647160	652960	ground, or more accurately the ocean, would actually hear two booms in very rapid succession.
652960	657520	That's because the shockwaves that are perceived as sonic booms originate almost
657520	661080	entirely from the nose and tail of the aircraft.
661080	666900	They coalesce together and travel to the ground, leading to those two rapid booms.
666900	672000	The theory behind NASA's X-59 aircraft is to spread those shockwaves out to create a
672000	675560	longer but quieter sonic boom.
675560	680640	With an elongated skinny shape and strategically placed canards, smaller shockwaves originate
680640	685060	across the length of the aircraft, thereby spreading the impact out.
685060	691640	After taking its first flight in 2022, this aircraft will be deployed from 2023 to 2025
691640	694480	to conduct tests over certain towns and cities.
694480	698500	They'll then gather feedback from those on the ground, essentially asking if the sound
698500	703160	is tolerable, before bringing their findings to national regulators around the world with
703160	709000	the goal of creating a new standard for an acceptable sonic boom in 2025.
709000	714320	Leon and Spike have quite a lot riding on that 2025 decision.
714320	719080	They're both basing their business around the prospect of enabling supersonic travel
719080	723160	not only over oceans, but over continents too.
723160	727520	Therefore, while their methods differ from NASA's, both companies are selling their
727520	732680	aircraft off of the promise of quiet sonic booms.
732680	739380	Boom Technologies, though, with their overture commercial jet, is taking a different tack.
739380	744900	When looking at boom's marketing materials, all the potential routes mentioned are transoceanic,
744900	746080	and that's no mistake.
746080	751960	They're not risking anything on the potential of governments changing a decades-old rule.
751960	757440	They're building a jet that's going to have a sonic boom, that's going to be loud,
757440	762280	and that's going to have little immediate prospect of flying over land—and they're
762280	763280	starting with that.
763280	767520	They're essentially building a jet that will be almost exclusively used on transatlantic
767520	772640	and transpacific routes, which do represent a big chunk of the world's long-haul flights,
772640	778280	and unless there's a massive change in legislation, it just won't be useful for, say, Europe
778280	780160	to Asia flights.
780160	784960	Boom certainly does have legislative hurdles—their aircraft will be louder at takeoff than current
784960	789660	noise restrictions allow—but this is part of the reason why the company, with the most
789660	795860	ambitious goal, might actually have one of the better chances at success.
795860	801340	But success for any of these companies, and passenger supersonic travel as a whole, all
801340	804540	hinges on the business case.
804540	811100	What brought Concorde down was, at a fundamental level, economics—even if it did attain profitability
811100	812620	for the airlines.
812620	818420	If anything, the attractiveness of supersonic passenger travel has declined since the days
818420	819420	of Concorde.
819420	824340	When it first entered service, the highest class of service on most airlines offered
824340	828660	seats similar to that of international premium economy today.
828660	834180	Nowadays, every major transatlantic airline has business class seats that lie flat as
834180	838220	beds, offering travelers the opportunity to get a decent night's rest while essentially
838220	841380	losing no productive time by flying overnight.
841380	847180	In addition, the vast majority of Concorde's passengers were traveling on business—a
847180	850900	segment of Traveler for which time efficiency is paramount.
850900	859180	In 1970, or 80, or 90, any time spent on a plane simply could not be productive for business.
859180	863860	Nowadays, though, most major airlines offer wifi, and people can conduct much of their
863860	869260	work remotely, meaning someone on a seven-hour transatlantic flight can, if they want, get
869260	872500	close to seven hours of work done.
872500	877300	Even if travel is now less time-efficient, it can be more productive.
877300	883940	Therefore, with supersonic travel theoretically less attractive, Aerion, Spike, and Boom need
883940	890500	to take the flawed business model of Concorde and improve upon it enough to not only fix
890500	896260	Concorde's issues, but address the new, more challenging business environment.
896260	901180	Of course, they know that, so that's exactly what they're doing.
901180	907540	Aerion and Spike, focusing first and foremost on private jets, sees this market as a more
907540	908980	attainable target.
908980	915820	Aerion, for example, is planning on a $120 million list price for its jet.
915820	922020	While this is quite the tidy sum, there are people buying $120 million private jets today.
922020	927860	For example, Airbus has sold more than 100 A320 family aircraft as private jets, and
927860	932180	those also list for upwards of $100 million.
932180	939820	There are also plenty of private 737s, A330s, 757s, A340s, 747s, and more.
939820	944620	With thousands of billionaires globally, there are certainly plenty of people who can and
944620	950100	will pay for the prestige and convenience of a supersonic private jet.
950100	955940	In addition to the lowered price sensitivity, the private jet market has another advantage.
955940	960620	Its consumers inherently value time incredibly highly.
960620	965520	On long-haul trips, most private jets are objectively less comfortable than certain
965520	968920	first-class options on commercial airlines.
968920	974060	Most mid-range private jets have 8-to-12 seats roughly equivalent in shape and size to those
974060	979500	used as first class on US domestic flights—a large recliner seat—in addition to a couch
979500	983400	which sometimes converts into a single bed for the primary traveler.
983400	987620	If you were to fly from Hong Kong to Sydney, for example, a group of wealthy people could
987620	992360	take Singapore Airlines' fully enclosed suites, with dedicated beds for each person,
992360	998720	for a fraction of the cost of a jet, but what they lose is time, convenience, and prestige.
998720	1003400	Considering that plenty of people still choose to fly private long-haul, the type of person
1003400	1009540	accustomed to flying private values time, convenience, and prestige first and foremost
1009540	1015340	above comfort, and that's exactly the market that supersonic private jets appeal to.
1015340	1021300	Aerion sees enough demand for 500 to 600 of their aircraft in the next 20 years and, if
1021300	1025700	they're right, they're well on their way to profitability.
1025700	1031340	Boom Technologies, meanwhile, has to confront the task of making supersonic work for commercial
1031340	1033100	airlines.
1033100	1038260	This time, it's not going to be all about prestige, airlines are not going to get aircraft
1038260	1042680	for a fraction of development costs, and they're going to have to fly on more than
1042680	1045900	the few highest-yield routes in the world.
1045900	1053060	Their strategy has been, essentially, to trade a marketing problem for a development problem.
1053060	1057940	They claim that their aircraft will enable airlines to charge fares similar to that of
1057940	1063380	business class, as opposed to the first-class fares that were charged for Concorde.
1063380	1068880	Of course, remember, in Concorde's final six months of operation for British Airways,
1068880	1074520	they charged lower fares, closer to business-class prices, and that correlated with the most
1074520	1077940	profitable six months in the aircraft's history.
1077940	1083060	Now, if Boom creates an aircraft with low enough purchase, fueling, and maintenance
1083060	1088760	costs to enable such business-class fares, it's hard to believe that airlines won't
1088760	1091420	find routes on which it'll work.
1091420	1095260	For now, we'll just have to take their word for it, and wait and see.
1095260	1100180	There's hardly any way now, a decade from Overture's earliest possible service entry,
1100180	1102900	to know if this is realistic.
1102900	1109740	The fundamental advantage that this new generation of supersonic passenger jets has is that it's
1109740	1113300	a new generation—a second generation.
1113300	1118100	Concorde's development program, financed by the French and British governments, was
1118100	1122440	a massively expensive, deeply unprofitable venture.
1122440	1129260	The true beneficiaries of that spending, though, are Aerion, Spike, Boom, and every other company
1129260	1132480	that will develop supersonic jets.
1132480	1136980	With the benefit of hindsight, they get to develop a jet that addresses Concorde's
1136980	1141620	shortcomings, which objectively means that they have more opportunity for success.
1141620	1146900	That's certainly not to say they will succeed—they each have to stay afloat throughout a long,
1146900	1152100	challenging, and risky development process—but they are closer to the finish line than anyone
1152100	1154340	has ever been before.
1154340	1159140	Whether the world needs or wants supersonic planes is an entirely different question,
1159140	1165300	but regardless, it seems more certain than ever that within a generation, the world will,
1165300	1170120	once again, become a far smaller place.
1170120	1174460	I myself, of course, never flew Concorde, so I was curious what it was like.
1174660	1178860	I know the broad strokes, but I wanted the nitty-gritty details.
1178860	1181220	What was the Concorde experience like in the airport?
1181220	1182220	Which lounge did they use?
1182220	1183980	What was the meal like on board?
1183980	1184980	What did people do on board?
1184980	1189140	What was it like to land in New York before taking off from London, at least on the clock?
1189140	1193940	So, I did a bunch of research, compiled it into a companion video to this one, and uploaded
1193940	1195580	that to Nebula.
1195580	1199660	Of course, the reason why it's there is because the YouTube algorithm actually punishes
1199660	1205520	us creators for trying something new, but Nebula is a different platform with no algorithm,
1205520	1211380	no ads, no data mining—it's a video platform that is just about great, unique content made
1211380	1214460	by great, independent, educational creators.
1214460	1219460	The ecosystem and its financial model allows us to take risks and make big-budget projects
1219460	1224500	like Alaska's Silent Summer—my brand new hour-long documentary shot on location in
1224500	1230660	Ketchikan, a tourist town in Alaska that suddenly had to confront a reality without tourists.
1230660	1235800	The best way to get Nebula is undoubtedly through the rather amazing CuriosityStream
1235800	1236860	bundle deal.
1236860	1242460	At current sale prices, it's less than $15 a year to get access to both sites.
1242460	1245680	CuriosityStream has some phenomenal stuff, too.
1245680	1249980	One of my favorites is Gander International, the airport in the middle of nowhere, about
1249980	1254420	the airport that used to be one of the most important in the world as a refueling point
1254420	1257940	between the US and Europe until planes got longer range.
1257940	1263320	I truly don't know of a better deal in streaming—two streaming sites with stuff you'll actually
1263320	1267740	watch for less than $15 a year at current sale pricing.
1267740	1272960	What's more, signing up actually helps support countless independent creators, so make sure
1272960	1277060	to do so at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
