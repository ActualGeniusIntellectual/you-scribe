00:13.240 --> 00:19.180
The story of supersonic passenger travel is long and tumultuous.

00:19.180 --> 00:23.620
Nearly everyone has heard some version of why Concorde failed.

00:23.620 --> 00:29.040
It was certainly the epitome of a technology ahead of its time, but the true story of why

00:29.080 --> 00:34.640
it failed, or rather, more accurately, why it retired, is more nuanced than the popular

00:34.640 --> 00:40.060
narrative of an overzealous, overly extravagant, inflexible aircraft.

00:40.060 --> 00:44.600
There are degrees to which that narrative is true, but what you don't often hear is

00:44.600 --> 00:48.160
this—Concorde was profitable.

00:48.160 --> 00:54.240
A 747, the flagship of any subsonic fleet during the reign of Concorde, required a gallon

00:54.240 --> 01:00.120
of fuel to carry one passenger 80 miles or one liter for 34 kilometers, assuming a full

01:00.120 --> 01:01.120
load.

01:01.120 --> 01:07.400
Meanwhile, Concorde required roughly one gallon to carry one passenger 17 miles or one liter

01:07.400 --> 01:12.440
per 7 kilometers—clearly a quite decisive difference.

01:12.440 --> 01:17.280
Concorde was vastly less efficient than the aircraft that is today fading away due to

01:17.280 --> 01:22.820
its inefficiency, but the story doesn't end there.

01:22.820 --> 01:27.260
That fuel currently costs about $1.68 per gallon.

01:27.260 --> 01:33.160
Therefore, the fuel bill on a New York to London 747 flight, per passenger, is about

01:33.160 --> 01:38.980
$73.50—not a dramatic amount relative to ticket prices.

01:38.980 --> 01:45.620
Similarly, Concorde, burning about 206 gallons or 780 liters of jet fuel to carry a passenger

01:45.620 --> 01:50.700
across the Atlantic, would burn $346 in fuel.

01:50.700 --> 01:55.540
That's a staggeringly small number compared to its inflation-adjusted ticket price of

01:55.540 --> 01:59.680
roughly $16,000 round trip.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.020
Both Air France and British Airways, the two operators of the aircraft, paid a small sum

02:05.020 --> 02:09.580
for the aircraft relative to its multi-billion dollar development cost, bankrolled by the

02:09.580 --> 02:12.100
French and British governments.

02:12.100 --> 02:16.560
Maintenance and operational costs were certainly high, but certainly not at the level that

02:16.560 --> 02:20.460
some autopsies of the aircraft's demise make them out to be.

02:20.460 --> 02:25.900
So altogether, both airlines were able to turn a tidy profit across the aircraft's

02:25.900 --> 02:31.580
three decades of supersonic service, but there were other issues.

02:31.580 --> 02:33.580
Part of it was versatility.

02:33.580 --> 02:39.100
With a meager 4,500 mile, 7,200 kilometer range, and a brutally loud sonic boom that

02:39.100 --> 02:43.780
forced nearly every government to ban it from flying over the speed of sound over land,

02:43.780 --> 02:48.980
there were very, very few routes on which the aircraft could be used effectively.

02:49.020 --> 02:54.140
Compounding those issues, its seats were sold slightly above first-class prices, around

02:54.140 --> 03:00.220
$16,000 round-trip inflation-adjusted, and there are very, very few routes that can sustain

03:00.220 --> 03:03.460
that level of first-class capacity.

03:03.460 --> 03:08.540
Between EOS, Lavion, MaxJet, SilverJet, British Airways, and others, there's a long history

03:08.540 --> 03:13.940
of airlines attempting to operate all business-class flights between London or Paris and New York,

03:13.940 --> 03:17.900
and yet every single one of these eventually failed.

03:17.900 --> 03:23.280
Concorde essentially involves trying to operate all first-class flights.

03:23.280 --> 03:29.180
For context, in a non-COVID-impacted schedule, British Airways flies a mere 98 first-class

03:29.180 --> 03:32.220
seats between London and New York each day.

03:32.220 --> 03:38.340
With Concorde's double daily New York schedule, British Airways was operating some 200 first-class

03:38.340 --> 03:43.140
seats in addition to dozens more on their regular subsonic services.

03:43.140 --> 03:48.320
That's an enormous amount of first-class capacity that this route, the most valuable

03:48.320 --> 03:53.980
in the world, can't even support today, so it's no surprise that it couldn't decades

03:53.980 --> 03:54.980
ago.

03:54.980 --> 04:01.120
Therefore, many Concorde services operated with more seats empty than full, and yet British

04:01.120 --> 04:04.200
Airways still turned a profit.

04:04.200 --> 04:09.620
Their typical 50-60% load factor worked great from a financial perspective, and some back

04:09.620 --> 04:14.820
of the napkin math estimates that they could have broken even with as little as a 35% load

04:14.820 --> 04:15.820
factor.

04:15.820 --> 04:20.000
In fact, it's possible that they stumbled into the right sales strategy—the one they

04:20.000 --> 04:25.000
had been missing all along—in the aircraft's final days.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.380
After it was announced that Concorde would be retired, but while it was still flying,

04:29.380 --> 04:34.500
British Airways heavily discounted fares, closer to business-class pricing, which increased

04:34.500 --> 04:42.700
load factors dramatically, and yet they turned a $70 million profit—more than they ever

04:42.700 --> 04:44.660
had before.

04:44.660 --> 04:49.640
But many believe that British Airways and Air France weren't seriously trying to make

04:49.640 --> 04:51.800
money with the aircraft.

04:51.800 --> 04:57.980
In the end, its end came as the result of decades of lesser issues colliding with pure,

04:57.980 --> 04:59.620
bad luck.

04:59.620 --> 05:06.420
While taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport on July 25th, 2000, Air France Concorde FBTSC

05:06.420 --> 05:11.420
ran over a piece of engine cowling that a previous departure had lost, blew a tire,

05:11.420 --> 05:17.900
and the ensuing debris ruptured a fuel tank, spilling fuel that ignited within seconds.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.220
One hundred and thirteen lives perished.

05:22.220 --> 05:27.140
This greatly sullied the image of the aircraft that both airlines had been using primarily

05:27.140 --> 05:31.340
as a marketing tool, rather than a true profit center.

05:31.340 --> 05:35.000
Maintenance bills were mounting as Concorde aged, and there were some indications that

05:35.000 --> 05:40.540
first-class services on subsonic British Airways and Air France planes were turning a higher

05:40.540 --> 05:41.540
profit.

05:41.540 --> 05:45.540
Assuming that was true, these airlines would rather have had their passengers fly their

05:45.540 --> 05:50.100
subsonic services—an assertion backed up by the fact that both airlines refused to

05:50.100 --> 05:54.940
sell rather than retire Concorde, worrying that that would lead to losing loyal Concorde

05:54.940 --> 05:59.540
flyers entirely, rather than converting them to subsonic services.

05:59.540 --> 06:07.580
Altogether, the time was right to sunset the world's first supersonic passenger plane.

06:07.580 --> 06:10.260
Two decades have now passed.

06:10.260 --> 06:14.500
With all the progress the world has made in its march through time, some could not accept

06:14.500 --> 06:18.260
a new era bound by mere subsonic travel.

06:18.780 --> 06:24.980
We're now approaching a possible renaissance of supersonic passenger planes, and this time,

06:24.980 --> 06:28.080
it might actually work.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.900
There are three key players in the race to bring back supersonic travel—none of which

06:32.900 --> 06:38.620
are Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, or any other current aircraft manufacturer.

06:38.620 --> 06:43.660
Aerion was founded in 2003, the same year as Concorde's retirement, and has spent

06:43.660 --> 06:48.820
the decade since developing a supersonic private jet, the AS-2.

06:48.820 --> 06:53.760
In the timescale of aircraft development, they're not too far from launch, with production

06:53.760 --> 06:58.540
expected to start in 2023, and a possible launch by 2026.

06:58.540 --> 07:03.100
Boasting financial backing from Boeing, and a partnership with GE for engine development,

07:03.100 --> 07:07.860
Aerion is certainly not in the business of selling pipe dreams.

07:07.860 --> 07:12.620
Operating with a similar business strategy, Spike Aerospace also aims to develop a smaller

07:12.620 --> 07:14.580
supersonic private jet.

07:14.580 --> 07:20.060
Uniquely, they're planning to reduce complexity and increase efficiency by eliminating windows

07:20.060 --> 07:24.820
entirely in the passenger cabin—replacing them with screens displaying high-definition

07:24.820 --> 07:26.860
camera feeds from outside.

07:26.860 --> 07:31.600
Despite its lack of big-name partners and a less slick public appearance, Spike is viewed

07:31.600 --> 07:36.020
as a real contender and is working on a similar timescale to Aerion.

07:36.020 --> 07:39.320
Then, there's Boom Technologies.

07:39.320 --> 07:44.740
If you've heard of any supersonic aircraft developer, this is the one.

07:44.740 --> 07:50.240
Their business model is entirely different—they're not taking the conservative, safer route with

07:50.240 --> 07:52.120
smaller private jets.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.780
They want the whole pie.

07:54.780 --> 07:59.000
They want to be Concorde 2.0.

07:59.000 --> 08:03.040
After emerging from the same powerhouse Silicon Valley accelerator program responsible for

08:03.040 --> 08:08.840
Airbnb, DoorDash, Reddit, and more, they've initially focused their time and funding on

08:08.840 --> 08:14.720
developing a one-person, proof-of-concept supersonic jet, the XB-1, to serve their ultimate

08:14.720 --> 08:21.360
goal of launching a 65-to-88 passenger commercial supersonic jet—the Overture.

08:21.360 --> 08:28.160
Like Aerion, they have some serious partners—Japan Airlines, the US Air Force, Rolls-Royce, and

08:28.160 --> 08:33.180
more—and are viewed as the most ambitious of the three companies, yet potentially the

08:33.180 --> 08:36.440
one with the most attainable goal.

08:36.440 --> 08:43.560
Now, supersonic passenger travel has already existed, even if it doesn't now.

08:43.560 --> 08:48.940
It will not be a technological breakthrough to simply make that happen again.

08:48.940 --> 08:55.000
What will be a breakthrough, if achieved, though, is doing what Concorde could not.

08:55.000 --> 09:01.620
Concorde could not facilitate widespread supersonic travel in a sustainable manner, both economically

09:01.620 --> 09:03.620
and environmentally.

09:03.620 --> 09:06.300
These companies just might.

09:06.300 --> 09:11.060
A good portion of Concorde's issues originated from noise.

09:11.060 --> 09:17.020
You see, a sonic boom is not, as some incorrectly believe, an isolated burst of noise at the

09:17.020 --> 09:20.060
moment a plane reaches the speed of sound.

09:20.060 --> 09:24.880
From the ground it is perceived as an isolated burst of sound, since a plane, and therefore

09:24.880 --> 09:30.320
its shockwaves, are moving, but a sonic boom originates continuously as any object travels

09:30.320 --> 09:32.400
above the speed of sound.

09:32.400 --> 09:38.300
Therefore, if Concorde were to fly from New York to Los Angeles at supersonic speeds,

09:38.300 --> 09:42.640
everyone between the cities would hear the 110 decibel noise.

09:42.640 --> 09:47.720
That's roughly equivalent to the loudness of a chainsaw in your own hands, so it's

09:47.720 --> 09:54.360
no wonder why nearly every country in the world banned supersonic planes over land.

09:54.360 --> 10:01.560
Many believe that, to make supersonic passenger aviation viable, these bans need to end.

10:01.560 --> 10:06.460
Meaning the political will to allow a small number of incredibly wealthy people in supersonic

10:06.460 --> 10:13.120
jets to create such noise pollution is unrealistic, so rather, quite a lot of work is being put

10:13.120 --> 10:18.000
into turning the sonic boom into more of a sonic thump.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.480
While there are a few different techniques being tested, NASA is leading one of the most

10:22.480 --> 10:27.000
concerted efforts to create a low-boom supersonic plane.

10:27.000 --> 10:32.020
They contracted Lockheed Martin to develop the X-59 as part of their Low-Boom Flight

10:32.020 --> 10:37.320
Demonstrator program and, if successful, it will turn the perceived loudness of a sonic

10:37.320 --> 10:42.500
boom from that of a chainsaw to a car door closing.

10:42.500 --> 10:47.160
You see, with Concorde, or essentially any existing supersonic plane, someone on the

10:47.160 --> 10:52.960
ground, or more accurately the ocean, would actually hear two booms in very rapid succession.

10:52.960 --> 10:57.520
That's because the shockwaves that are perceived as sonic booms originate almost

10:57.520 --> 11:01.080
entirely from the nose and tail of the aircraft.

11:01.080 --> 11:06.900
They coalesce together and travel to the ground, leading to those two rapid booms.

11:06.900 --> 11:12.000
The theory behind NASA's X-59 aircraft is to spread those shockwaves out to create a

11:12.000 --> 11:15.560
longer but quieter sonic boom.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.640
With an elongated skinny shape and strategically placed canards, smaller shockwaves originate

11:20.640 --> 11:25.060
across the length of the aircraft, thereby spreading the impact out.

11:25.060 --> 11:31.640
After taking its first flight in 2022, this aircraft will be deployed from 2023 to 2025

11:31.640 --> 11:34.480
to conduct tests over certain towns and cities.

11:34.480 --> 11:38.500
They'll then gather feedback from those on the ground, essentially asking if the sound

11:38.500 --> 11:43.160
is tolerable, before bringing their findings to national regulators around the world with

11:43.160 --> 11:49.000
the goal of creating a new standard for an acceptable sonic boom in 2025.

11:49.000 --> 11:54.320
Leon and Spike have quite a lot riding on that 2025 decision.

11:54.320 --> 11:59.080
They're both basing their business around the prospect of enabling supersonic travel

11:59.080 --> 12:03.160
not only over oceans, but over continents too.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.520
Therefore, while their methods differ from NASA's, both companies are selling their

12:07.520 --> 12:12.680
aircraft off of the promise of quiet sonic booms.

12:12.680 --> 12:19.380
Boom Technologies, though, with their overture commercial jet, is taking a different tack.

12:19.380 --> 12:24.900
When looking at boom's marketing materials, all the potential routes mentioned are transoceanic,

12:24.900 --> 12:26.080
and that's no mistake.

12:26.080 --> 12:31.960
They're not risking anything on the potential of governments changing a decades-old rule.

12:31.960 --> 12:37.440
They're building a jet that's going to have a sonic boom, that's going to be loud,

12:37.440 --> 12:42.280
and that's going to have little immediate prospect of flying over land—and they're

12:42.280 --> 12:43.280
starting with that.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.520
They're essentially building a jet that will be almost exclusively used on transatlantic

12:47.520 --> 12:52.640
and transpacific routes, which do represent a big chunk of the world's long-haul flights,

12:52.640 --> 12:58.280
and unless there's a massive change in legislation, it just won't be useful for, say, Europe

12:58.280 --> 13:00.160
to Asia flights.

13:00.160 --> 13:04.960
Boom certainly does have legislative hurdles—their aircraft will be louder at takeoff than current

13:04.960 --> 13:09.660
noise restrictions allow—but this is part of the reason why the company, with the most

13:09.660 --> 13:15.860
ambitious goal, might actually have one of the better chances at success.

13:15.860 --> 13:21.340
But success for any of these companies, and passenger supersonic travel as a whole, all

13:21.340 --> 13:24.540
hinges on the business case.

13:24.540 --> 13:31.100
What brought Concorde down was, at a fundamental level, economics—even if it did attain profitability

13:31.100 --> 13:32.620
for the airlines.

13:32.620 --> 13:38.420
If anything, the attractiveness of supersonic passenger travel has declined since the days

13:38.420 --> 13:39.420
of Concorde.

13:39.420 --> 13:44.340
When it first entered service, the highest class of service on most airlines offered

13:44.340 --> 13:48.660
seats similar to that of international premium economy today.

13:48.660 --> 13:54.180
Nowadays, every major transatlantic airline has business class seats that lie flat as

13:54.180 --> 13:58.220
beds, offering travelers the opportunity to get a decent night's rest while essentially

13:58.220 --> 14:01.380
losing no productive time by flying overnight.

14:01.380 --> 14:07.180
In addition, the vast majority of Concorde's passengers were traveling on business—a

14:07.180 --> 14:10.900
segment of Traveler for which time efficiency is paramount.

14:10.900 --> 14:19.180
In 1970, or 80, or 90, any time spent on a plane simply could not be productive for business.

14:19.180 --> 14:23.860
Nowadays, though, most major airlines offer wifi, and people can conduct much of their

14:23.860 --> 14:29.260
work remotely, meaning someone on a seven-hour transatlantic flight can, if they want, get

14:29.260 --> 14:32.500
close to seven hours of work done.

14:32.500 --> 14:37.300
Even if travel is now less time-efficient, it can be more productive.

14:37.300 --> 14:43.940
Therefore, with supersonic travel theoretically less attractive, Aerion, Spike, and Boom need

14:43.940 --> 14:50.500
to take the flawed business model of Concorde and improve upon it enough to not only fix

14:50.500 --> 14:56.260
Concorde's issues, but address the new, more challenging business environment.

14:56.260 --> 15:01.180
Of course, they know that, so that's exactly what they're doing.

15:01.180 --> 15:07.540
Aerion and Spike, focusing first and foremost on private jets, sees this market as a more

15:07.540 --> 15:08.980
attainable target.

15:08.980 --> 15:15.820
Aerion, for example, is planning on a $120 million list price for its jet.

15:15.820 --> 15:22.020
While this is quite the tidy sum, there are people buying $120 million private jets today.

15:22.020 --> 15:27.860
For example, Airbus has sold more than 100 A320 family aircraft as private jets, and

15:27.860 --> 15:32.180
those also list for upwards of $100 million.

15:32.180 --> 15:39.820
There are also plenty of private 737s, A330s, 757s, A340s, 747s, and more.

15:39.820 --> 15:44.620
With thousands of billionaires globally, there are certainly plenty of people who can and

15:44.620 --> 15:50.100
will pay for the prestige and convenience of a supersonic private jet.

15:50.100 --> 15:55.940
In addition to the lowered price sensitivity, the private jet market has another advantage.

15:55.940 --> 16:00.620
Its consumers inherently value time incredibly highly.

16:00.620 --> 16:05.520
On long-haul trips, most private jets are objectively less comfortable than certain

16:05.520 --> 16:08.920
first-class options on commercial airlines.

16:08.920 --> 16:14.060
Most mid-range private jets have 8-to-12 seats roughly equivalent in shape and size to those

16:14.060 --> 16:19.500
used as first class on US domestic flights—a large recliner seat—in addition to a couch

16:19.500 --> 16:23.400
which sometimes converts into a single bed for the primary traveler.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.620
If you were to fly from Hong Kong to Sydney, for example, a group of wealthy people could

16:27.620 --> 16:32.360
take Singapore Airlines' fully enclosed suites, with dedicated beds for each person,

16:32.360 --> 16:38.720
for a fraction of the cost of a jet, but what they lose is time, convenience, and prestige.

16:38.720 --> 16:43.400
Considering that plenty of people still choose to fly private long-haul, the type of person

16:43.400 --> 16:49.540
accustomed to flying private values time, convenience, and prestige first and foremost

16:49.540 --> 16:55.340
above comfort, and that's exactly the market that supersonic private jets appeal to.

16:55.340 --> 17:01.300
Aerion sees enough demand for 500 to 600 of their aircraft in the next 20 years and, if

17:01.300 --> 17:05.700
they're right, they're well on their way to profitability.

17:05.700 --> 17:11.340
Boom Technologies, meanwhile, has to confront the task of making supersonic work for commercial

17:11.340 --> 17:13.100
airlines.

17:13.100 --> 17:18.260
This time, it's not going to be all about prestige, airlines are not going to get aircraft

17:18.260 --> 17:22.680
for a fraction of development costs, and they're going to have to fly on more than

17:22.680 --> 17:25.900
the few highest-yield routes in the world.

17:25.900 --> 17:33.060
Their strategy has been, essentially, to trade a marketing problem for a development problem.

17:33.060 --> 17:37.940
They claim that their aircraft will enable airlines to charge fares similar to that of

17:37.940 --> 17:43.380
business class, as opposed to the first-class fares that were charged for Concorde.

17:43.380 --> 17:48.880
Of course, remember, in Concorde's final six months of operation for British Airways,

17:48.880 --> 17:54.520
they charged lower fares, closer to business-class prices, and that correlated with the most

17:54.520 --> 17:57.940
profitable six months in the aircraft's history.

17:57.940 --> 18:03.060
Now, if Boom creates an aircraft with low enough purchase, fueling, and maintenance

18:03.060 --> 18:08.760
costs to enable such business-class fares, it's hard to believe that airlines won't

18:08.760 --> 18:11.420
find routes on which it'll work.

18:11.420 --> 18:15.260
For now, we'll just have to take their word for it, and wait and see.

18:15.260 --> 18:20.180
There's hardly any way now, a decade from Overture's earliest possible service entry,

18:20.180 --> 18:22.900
to know if this is realistic.

18:22.900 --> 18:29.740
The fundamental advantage that this new generation of supersonic passenger jets has is that it's

18:29.740 --> 18:33.300
a new generation—a second generation.

18:33.300 --> 18:38.100
Concorde's development program, financed by the French and British governments, was

18:38.100 --> 18:42.440
a massively expensive, deeply unprofitable venture.

18:42.440 --> 18:49.260
The true beneficiaries of that spending, though, are Aerion, Spike, Boom, and every other company

18:49.260 --> 18:52.480
that will develop supersonic jets.

18:52.480 --> 18:56.980
With the benefit of hindsight, they get to develop a jet that addresses Concorde's

18:56.980 --> 19:01.620
shortcomings, which objectively means that they have more opportunity for success.

19:01.620 --> 19:06.900
That's certainly not to say they will succeed—they each have to stay afloat throughout a long,

19:06.900 --> 19:12.100
challenging, and risky development process—but they are closer to the finish line than anyone

19:12.100 --> 19:14.340
has ever been before.

19:14.340 --> 19:19.140
Whether the world needs or wants supersonic planes is an entirely different question,

19:19.140 --> 19:25.300
but regardless, it seems more certain than ever that within a generation, the world will,

19:25.300 --> 19:30.120
once again, become a far smaller place.

19:30.120 --> 19:34.460
I myself, of course, never flew Concorde, so I was curious what it was like.

19:34.660 --> 19:38.860
I know the broad strokes, but I wanted the nitty-gritty details.

19:38.860 --> 19:41.220
What was the Concorde experience like in the airport?

19:41.220 --> 19:42.220
Which lounge did they use?

19:42.220 --> 19:43.980
What was the meal like on board?

19:43.980 --> 19:44.980
What did people do on board?

19:44.980 --> 19:49.140
What was it like to land in New York before taking off from London, at least on the clock?

19:49.140 --> 19:53.940
So, I did a bunch of research, compiled it into a companion video to this one, and uploaded

19:53.940 --> 19:55.580
that to Nebula.

19:55.580 --> 19:59.660
Of course, the reason why it's there is because the YouTube algorithm actually punishes

19:59.660 --> 20:05.520
us creators for trying something new, but Nebula is a different platform with no algorithm,

20:05.520 --> 20:11.380
no ads, no data mining—it's a video platform that is just about great, unique content made

20:11.380 --> 20:14.460
by great, independent, educational creators.

20:14.460 --> 20:19.460
The ecosystem and its financial model allows us to take risks and make big-budget projects

20:19.460 --> 20:24.500
like Alaska's Silent Summer—my brand new hour-long documentary shot on location in

20:24.500 --> 20:30.660
Ketchikan, a tourist town in Alaska that suddenly had to confront a reality without tourists.

20:30.660 --> 20:35.800
The best way to get Nebula is undoubtedly through the rather amazing CuriosityStream

20:35.800 --> 20:36.860
bundle deal.

20:36.860 --> 20:42.460
At current sale prices, it's less than $15 a year to get access to both sites.

20:42.460 --> 20:45.680
CuriosityStream has some phenomenal stuff, too.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.980
One of my favorites is Gander International, the airport in the middle of nowhere, about

20:49.980 --> 20:54.420
the airport that used to be one of the most important in the world as a refueling point

20:54.420 --> 20:57.940
between the US and Europe until planes got longer range.

20:57.940 --> 21:03.320
I truly don't know of a better deal in streaming—two streaming sites with stuff you'll actually

21:03.320 --> 21:07.740
watch for less than $15 a year at current sale pricing.

21:07.740 --> 21:12.960
What's more, signing up actually helps support countless independent creators, so make sure

21:12.960 --> 21:17.060
to do so at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
