4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:19,180
The story of supersonic passenger travel is long and tumultuous.

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,620
Nearly everyone has heard some version of why Concorde failed.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:29,040
It was certainly the epitome of a technology ahead of its time, but the true story of why

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,640
it failed, or rather, more accurately, why it retired, is more nuanced than the popular

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,060
narrative of an overzealous, overly extravagant, inflexible aircraft.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,600
There are degrees to which that narrative is true, but what you don't often hear is

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,160
this—Concorde was profitable.

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,240
A 747, the flagship of any subsonic fleet during the reign of Concorde, required a gallon

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,120
of fuel to carry one passenger 80 miles or one liter for 34 kilometers, assuming a full

13
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
load.

14
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,400
Meanwhile, Concorde required roughly one gallon to carry one passenger 17 miles or one liter

15
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,440
per 7 kilometers—clearly a quite decisive difference.

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,280
Concorde was vastly less efficient than the aircraft that is today fading away due to

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,820
its inefficiency, but the story doesn't end there.

18
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,260
That fuel currently costs about $1.68 per gallon.

19
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:33,160
Therefore, the fuel bill on a New York to London 747 flight, per passenger, is about

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:38,980
$73.50—not a dramatic amount relative to ticket prices.

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:45,620
Similarly, Concorde, burning about 206 gallons or 780 liters of jet fuel to carry a passenger

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:50,700
across the Atlantic, would burn $346 in fuel.

23
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,540
That's a staggeringly small number compared to its inflation-adjusted ticket price of

24
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:59,680
roughly $16,000 round trip.

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,020
Both Air France and British Airways, the two operators of the aircraft, paid a small sum

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,580
for the aircraft relative to its multi-billion dollar development cost, bankrolled by the

27
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,100
French and British governments.

28
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,560
Maintenance and operational costs were certainly high, but certainly not at the level that

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,460
some autopsies of the aircraft's demise make them out to be.

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:25,900
So altogether, both airlines were able to turn a tidy profit across the aircraft's

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,580
three decades of supersonic service, but there were other issues.

32
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,580
Part of it was versatility.

33
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,100
With a meager 4,500 mile, 7,200 kilometer range, and a brutally loud sonic boom that

34
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,780
forced nearly every government to ban it from flying over the speed of sound over land,

35
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,980
there were very, very few routes on which the aircraft could be used effectively.

36
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,140
Compounding those issues, its seats were sold slightly above first-class prices, around

37
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,220
$16,000 round-trip inflation-adjusted, and there are very, very few routes that can sustain

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,460
that level of first-class capacity.

39
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,540
Between EOS, Lavion, MaxJet, SilverJet, British Airways, and others, there's a long history

40
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,940
of airlines attempting to operate all business-class flights between London or Paris and New York,

41
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,900
and yet every single one of these eventually failed.

42
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,280
Concorde essentially involves trying to operate all first-class flights.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,180
For context, in a non-COVID-impacted schedule, British Airways flies a mere 98 first-class

44
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,220
seats between London and New York each day.

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,340
With Concorde's double daily New York schedule, British Airways was operating some 200 first-class

46
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,140
seats in addition to dozens more on their regular subsonic services.

47
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,320
That's an enormous amount of first-class capacity that this route, the most valuable

48
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,980
in the world, can't even support today, so it's no surprise that it couldn't decades

49
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
ago.

50
00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,120
Therefore, many Concorde services operated with more seats empty than full, and yet British

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,200
Airways still turned a profit.

52
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:09,620
Their typical 50-60% load factor worked great from a financial perspective, and some back

53
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,820
of the napkin math estimates that they could have broken even with as little as a 35% load

54
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,820
factor.

55
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,000
In fact, it's possible that they stumbled into the right sales strategy—the one they

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
had been missing all along—in the aircraft's final days.

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,380
After it was announced that Concorde would be retired, but while it was still flying,

58
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,500
British Airways heavily discounted fares, closer to business-class pricing, which increased

59
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:42,700
load factors dramatically, and yet they turned a $70 million profit—more than they ever

60
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,660
had before.

61
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,640
But many believe that British Airways and Air France weren't seriously trying to make

62
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,800
money with the aircraft.

63
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,980
In the end, its end came as the result of decades of lesser issues colliding with pure,

64
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,620
bad luck.

65
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,420
While taking off from Charles de Gaulle Airport on July 25th, 2000, Air France Concorde FBTSC

66
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:11,420
ran over a piece of engine cowling that a previous departure had lost, blew a tire,

67
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,900
and the ensuing debris ruptured a fuel tank, spilling fuel that ignited within seconds.

68
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,220
One hundred and thirteen lives perished.

69
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:27,140
This greatly sullied the image of the aircraft that both airlines had been using primarily

70
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,340
as a marketing tool, rather than a true profit center.

71
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,000
Maintenance bills were mounting as Concorde aged, and there were some indications that

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,540
first-class services on subsonic British Airways and Air France planes were turning a higher

73
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
profit.

74
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Assuming that was true, these airlines would rather have had their passengers fly their

75
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,100
subsonic services—an assertion backed up by the fact that both airlines refused to

76
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,940
sell rather than retire Concorde, worrying that that would lead to losing loyal Concorde

77
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,540
flyers entirely, rather than converting them to subsonic services.

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,580
Altogether, the time was right to sunset the world's first supersonic passenger plane.

79
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,260
Two decades have now passed.

80
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,500
With all the progress the world has made in its march through time, some could not accept

81
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,260
a new era bound by mere subsonic travel.

82
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:24,980
We're now approaching a possible renaissance of supersonic passenger planes, and this time,

83
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,080
it might actually work.

84
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,900
There are three key players in the race to bring back supersonic travel—none of which

85
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,620
are Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, or any other current aircraft manufacturer.

86
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,660
Aerion was founded in 2003, the same year as Concorde's retirement, and has spent

87
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:48,820
the decade since developing a supersonic private jet, the AS-2.

88
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,760
In the timescale of aircraft development, they're not too far from launch, with production

89
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,540
expected to start in 2023, and a possible launch by 2026.

90
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,100
Boasting financial backing from Boeing, and a partnership with GE for engine development,

91
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,860
Aerion is certainly not in the business of selling pipe dreams.

92
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,620
Operating with a similar business strategy, Spike Aerospace also aims to develop a smaller

93
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,580
supersonic private jet.

94
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:20,060
Uniquely, they're planning to reduce complexity and increase efficiency by eliminating windows

95
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,820
entirely in the passenger cabin—replacing them with screens displaying high-definition

96
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,860
camera feeds from outside.

97
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,600
Despite its lack of big-name partners and a less slick public appearance, Spike is viewed

98
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,020
as a real contender and is working on a similar timescale to Aerion.

99
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,320
Then, there's Boom Technologies.

100
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,740
If you've heard of any supersonic aircraft developer, this is the one.

101
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,240
Their business model is entirely different—they're not taking the conservative, safer route with

102
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,120
smaller private jets.

103
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,780
They want the whole pie.

104
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,000
They want to be Concorde 2.0.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,040
After emerging from the same powerhouse Silicon Valley accelerator program responsible for

106
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,840
Airbnb, DoorDash, Reddit, and more, they've initially focused their time and funding on

107
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,720
developing a one-person, proof-of-concept supersonic jet, the XB-1, to serve their ultimate

108
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,360
goal of launching a 65-to-88 passenger commercial supersonic jet—the Overture.

109
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,160
Like Aerion, they have some serious partners—Japan Airlines, the US Air Force, Rolls-Royce, and

110
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,180
more—and are viewed as the most ambitious of the three companies, yet potentially the

111
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,440
one with the most attainable goal.

112
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,560
Now, supersonic passenger travel has already existed, even if it doesn't now.

113
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,940
It will not be a technological breakthrough to simply make that happen again.

114
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:55,000
What will be a breakthrough, if achieved, though, is doing what Concorde could not.

115
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,620
Concorde could not facilitate widespread supersonic travel in a sustainable manner, both economically

116
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,620
and environmentally.

117
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,300
These companies just might.

118
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,060
A good portion of Concorde's issues originated from noise.

119
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,020
You see, a sonic boom is not, as some incorrectly believe, an isolated burst of noise at the

120
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,060
moment a plane reaches the speed of sound.

121
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,880
From the ground it is perceived as an isolated burst of sound, since a plane, and therefore

122
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,320
its shockwaves, are moving, but a sonic boom originates continuously as any object travels

123
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,400
above the speed of sound.

124
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:38,300
Therefore, if Concorde were to fly from New York to Los Angeles at supersonic speeds,

125
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:42,640
everyone between the cities would hear the 110 decibel noise.

126
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,720
That's roughly equivalent to the loudness of a chainsaw in your own hands, so it's

127
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:54,360
no wonder why nearly every country in the world banned supersonic planes over land.

128
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,560
Many believe that, to make supersonic passenger aviation viable, these bans need to end.

129
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,460
Meaning the political will to allow a small number of incredibly wealthy people in supersonic

130
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:13,120
jets to create such noise pollution is unrealistic, so rather, quite a lot of work is being put

131
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,000
into turning the sonic boom into more of a sonic thump.

132
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
While there are a few different techniques being tested, NASA is leading one of the most

133
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,000
concerted efforts to create a low-boom supersonic plane.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,020
They contracted Lockheed Martin to develop the X-59 as part of their Low-Boom Flight

135
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,320
Demonstrator program and, if successful, it will turn the perceived loudness of a sonic

136
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,500
boom from that of a chainsaw to a car door closing.

137
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,160
You see, with Concorde, or essentially any existing supersonic plane, someone on the

138
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,960
ground, or more accurately the ocean, would actually hear two booms in very rapid succession.

139
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:57,520
That's because the shockwaves that are perceived as sonic booms originate almost

140
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,080
entirely from the nose and tail of the aircraft.

141
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,900
They coalesce together and travel to the ground, leading to those two rapid booms.

142
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,000
The theory behind NASA's X-59 aircraft is to spread those shockwaves out to create a

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,560
longer but quieter sonic boom.

144
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:20,640
With an elongated skinny shape and strategically placed canards, smaller shockwaves originate

145
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,060
across the length of the aircraft, thereby spreading the impact out.

146
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,640
After taking its first flight in 2022, this aircraft will be deployed from 2023 to 2025

147
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,480
to conduct tests over certain towns and cities.

148
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,500
They'll then gather feedback from those on the ground, essentially asking if the sound

149
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,160
is tolerable, before bringing their findings to national regulators around the world with

150
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,000
the goal of creating a new standard for an acceptable sonic boom in 2025.

151
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,320
Leon and Spike have quite a lot riding on that 2025 decision.

152
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,080
They're both basing their business around the prospect of enabling supersonic travel

153
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,160
not only over oceans, but over continents too.

154
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,520
Therefore, while their methods differ from NASA's, both companies are selling their

155
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,680
aircraft off of the promise of quiet sonic booms.

156
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:19,380
Boom Technologies, though, with their overture commercial jet, is taking a different tack.

157
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,900
When looking at boom's marketing materials, all the potential routes mentioned are transoceanic,

158
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,080
and that's no mistake.

159
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:31,960
They're not risking anything on the potential of governments changing a decades-old rule.

160
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,440
They're building a jet that's going to have a sonic boom, that's going to be loud,

161
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,280
and that's going to have little immediate prospect of flying over land—and they're

162
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
starting with that.

163
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,520
They're essentially building a jet that will be almost exclusively used on transatlantic

164
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,640
and transpacific routes, which do represent a big chunk of the world's long-haul flights,

165
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:58,280
and unless there's a massive change in legislation, it just won't be useful for, say, Europe

166
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,160
to Asia flights.

167
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,960
Boom certainly does have legislative hurdles—their aircraft will be louder at takeoff than current

168
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,660
noise restrictions allow—but this is part of the reason why the company, with the most

169
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,860
ambitious goal, might actually have one of the better chances at success.

170
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,340
But success for any of these companies, and passenger supersonic travel as a whole, all

171
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,540
hinges on the business case.

172
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:31,100
What brought Concorde down was, at a fundamental level, economics—even if it did attain profitability

173
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,620
for the airlines.

174
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,420
If anything, the attractiveness of supersonic passenger travel has declined since the days

175
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,420
of Concorde.

176
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,340
When it first entered service, the highest class of service on most airlines offered

177
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,660
seats similar to that of international premium economy today.

178
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,180
Nowadays, every major transatlantic airline has business class seats that lie flat as

179
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:58,220
beds, offering travelers the opportunity to get a decent night's rest while essentially

180
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:01,380
losing no productive time by flying overnight.

181
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,180
In addition, the vast majority of Concorde's passengers were traveling on business—a

182
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,900
segment of Traveler for which time efficiency is paramount.

183
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:19,180
In 1970, or 80, or 90, any time spent on a plane simply could not be productive for business.

184
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,860
Nowadays, though, most major airlines offer wifi, and people can conduct much of their

185
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,260
work remotely, meaning someone on a seven-hour transatlantic flight can, if they want, get

186
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,500
close to seven hours of work done.

187
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,300
Even if travel is now less time-efficient, it can be more productive.

188
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:43,940
Therefore, with supersonic travel theoretically less attractive, Aerion, Spike, and Boom need

189
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:50,500
to take the flawed business model of Concorde and improve upon it enough to not only fix

190
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,260
Concorde's issues, but address the new, more challenging business environment.

191
00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:01,180
Of course, they know that, so that's exactly what they're doing.

192
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,540
Aerion and Spike, focusing first and foremost on private jets, sees this market as a more

193
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,980
attainable target.

194
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:15,820
Aerion, for example, is planning on a $120 million list price for its jet.

195
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:22,020
While this is quite the tidy sum, there are people buying $120 million private jets today.

196
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,860
For example, Airbus has sold more than 100 A320 family aircraft as private jets, and

197
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,180
those also list for upwards of $100 million.

198
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:39,820
There are also plenty of private 737s, A330s, 757s, A340s, 747s, and more.

199
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,620
With thousands of billionaires globally, there are certainly plenty of people who can and

200
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:50,100
will pay for the prestige and convenience of a supersonic private jet.

201
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,940
In addition to the lowered price sensitivity, the private jet market has another advantage.

202
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,620
Its consumers inherently value time incredibly highly.

203
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,520
On long-haul trips, most private jets are objectively less comfortable than certain

204
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,920
first-class options on commercial airlines.

205
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,060
Most mid-range private jets have 8-to-12 seats roughly equivalent in shape and size to those

206
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,500
used as first class on US domestic flights—a large recliner seat—in addition to a couch

207
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,400
which sometimes converts into a single bed for the primary traveler.

208
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,620
If you were to fly from Hong Kong to Sydney, for example, a group of wealthy people could

209
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,360
take Singapore Airlines' fully enclosed suites, with dedicated beds for each person,

210
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:38,720
for a fraction of the cost of a jet, but what they lose is time, convenience, and prestige.

211
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,400
Considering that plenty of people still choose to fly private long-haul, the type of person

212
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,540
accustomed to flying private values time, convenience, and prestige first and foremost

213
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,340
above comfort, and that's exactly the market that supersonic private jets appeal to.

214
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,300
Aerion sees enough demand for 500 to 600 of their aircraft in the next 20 years and, if

215
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,700
they're right, they're well on their way to profitability.

216
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:11,340
Boom Technologies, meanwhile, has to confront the task of making supersonic work for commercial

217
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,100
airlines.

218
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,260
This time, it's not going to be all about prestige, airlines are not going to get aircraft

219
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,680
for a fraction of development costs, and they're going to have to fly on more than

220
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,900
the few highest-yield routes in the world.

221
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:33,060
Their strategy has been, essentially, to trade a marketing problem for a development problem.

222
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,940
They claim that their aircraft will enable airlines to charge fares similar to that of

223
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,380
business class, as opposed to the first-class fares that were charged for Concorde.

224
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,880
Of course, remember, in Concorde's final six months of operation for British Airways,

225
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,520
they charged lower fares, closer to business-class prices, and that correlated with the most

226
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,940
profitable six months in the aircraft's history.

227
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,060
Now, if Boom creates an aircraft with low enough purchase, fueling, and maintenance

228
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,760
costs to enable such business-class fares, it's hard to believe that airlines won't

229
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,420
find routes on which it'll work.

230
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,260
For now, we'll just have to take their word for it, and wait and see.

231
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,180
There's hardly any way now, a decade from Overture's earliest possible service entry,

232
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,900
to know if this is realistic.

233
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,740
The fundamental advantage that this new generation of supersonic passenger jets has is that it's

234
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,300
a new generation—a second generation.

235
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:38,100
Concorde's development program, financed by the French and British governments, was

236
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,440
a massively expensive, deeply unprofitable venture.

237
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:49,260
The true beneficiaries of that spending, though, are Aerion, Spike, Boom, and every other company

238
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,480
that will develop supersonic jets.

239
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,980
With the benefit of hindsight, they get to develop a jet that addresses Concorde's

240
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,620
shortcomings, which objectively means that they have more opportunity for success.

241
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:06,900
That's certainly not to say they will succeed—they each have to stay afloat throughout a long,

242
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,100
challenging, and risky development process—but they are closer to the finish line than anyone

243
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,340
has ever been before.

244
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,140
Whether the world needs or wants supersonic planes is an entirely different question,

245
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,300
but regardless, it seems more certain than ever that within a generation, the world will,

246
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,120
once again, become a far smaller place.

247
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,460
I myself, of course, never flew Concorde, so I was curious what it was like.

248
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,860
I know the broad strokes, but I wanted the nitty-gritty details.

249
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,220
What was the Concorde experience like in the airport?

250
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Which lounge did they use?

251
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,980
What was the meal like on board?

252
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
What did people do on board?

253
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:49,140
What was it like to land in New York before taking off from London, at least on the clock?

254
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,940
So, I did a bunch of research, compiled it into a companion video to this one, and uploaded

255
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,580
that to Nebula.

256
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,660
Of course, the reason why it's there is because the YouTube algorithm actually punishes

257
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,520
us creators for trying something new, but Nebula is a different platform with no algorithm,

258
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,380
no ads, no data mining—it's a video platform that is just about great, unique content made

259
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,460
by great, independent, educational creators.

260
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,460
The ecosystem and its financial model allows us to take risks and make big-budget projects

261
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:24,500
like Alaska's Silent Summer—my brand new hour-long documentary shot on location in

262
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:30,660
Ketchikan, a tourist town in Alaska that suddenly had to confront a reality without tourists.

263
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,800
The best way to get Nebula is undoubtedly through the rather amazing CuriosityStream

264
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,860
bundle deal.

265
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,460
At current sale prices, it's less than $15 a year to get access to both sites.

266
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,680
CuriosityStream has some phenomenal stuff, too.

267
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,980
One of my favorites is Gander International, the airport in the middle of nowhere, about

268
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,420
the airport that used to be one of the most important in the world as a refueling point

269
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,940
between the US and Europe until planes got longer range.

270
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:03,320
I truly don't know of a better deal in streaming—two streaming sites with stuff you'll actually

271
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,740
watch for less than $15 a year at current sale pricing.

272
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,960
What's more, signing up actually helps support countless independent creators, so make sure

273
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,060
to do so at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover.
