0	4940	If an American wants to buy something in Britain, they'd need British Pounds.
4940	8460	The easiest way to get Pounds is by finding a British person who wants to buy something
8460	11500	in America—they'd need US dollars.
11500	15400	Each currency represents value that can be exchanged for goods and services, so the logic
15400	19320	follows that one can trade two facsimiles of value for each other, but the same can
19320	22400	be said for the Swedish Krona and the Samoan Tala.
22400	26720	A certain number of each can be traded for, say, a gallon of gas in each country, and
26720	30280	yet the two cannot be traded for each other quite so easily.
30280	35240	You see, Samoans only import about $19,000 of goods from Sweden each year, and Swedes
35240	37560	barely import anything from Samoa.
37560	41920	Therefore, the likelihood of finding a Swede looking for Samoan Talas at a given time is
41920	46620	low, even if a certain number of Talas always corresponds to the same value as a certain
46620	49520	number of Krona—it's just an exchange barrier.
49520	52160	But the Samoan can get around this.
52160	57480	Some $40 million flows between Samoa and the United States each year, meaning, at any given
57480	61120	time, there is almost certainly an American looking for Talas to pay for Samoan exports,
61120	63640	so they can transfer their Talas into dollars.
63640	68640	Then, some $25 billion in trade happens between the US and Sweden each year, so it's even
68640	73160	easier to convert dollars into Krona, meaning a full Talas to Krona transaction can take
73160	75600	place just via the US dollar.
75600	79160	Not only has the transaction occurred faster than if one waited around for a willing Swede
79160	83280	to trade for Talas, it likely costs less since the Samoan didn't have to incentivize
83280	86840	demand through offering a higher-than-warranted number of Talas per Krona.
86840	92260	There are 180 UN-recognized currencies out there, meaning there are thousands upon thousands
92260	95200	of unique combinations of currency that can be exchanged.
95200	99840	Even at the scale of the global economy, this means it's not always easy to find a willing
99840	102520	partner to trade currency with when needed.
102520	108360	Therefore, 88% of the time, currency transactions occur with the US dollar.
108360	112720	This doesn't mean 88% of transactions are ultimately from or for the US dollar, but
112720	117840	rather that it's often just easier to facilitate international transactions through the US dollar.
117840	122640	It's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy—it's easiest to trade with the most traded currency,
122640	126340	and therefore the most traded currency is traded most.
126340	130640	These days, the US dollar serves that role—it is the plumbing of the global economy—but
130640	133380	that's a relatively new role.
133380	138240	Before the IMF or the WTO, before this century, last century, or the century prior, before
138240	143180	central banks or the concept of nations, there was trade—trade between states, trade across
143180	146740	kingdoms and fiefdoms, trade between tribes and clans.
146740	150700	In the West, as the world got bigger, the trade networks became more complex and the
150700	155620	means of trade centralized around currencies, and since the very beginning of modern trade,
155620	160700	there's always existed a currency that's just easier to do business with—a dominant
160700	165000	currency, a global currency, a reserve currency.
165000	168900	The earliest coins connecting trade across Europe and the Near East originated first
168900	174360	in the merchant-heavy city-states of the Mediterranean—Venice's Ducat and Florence's Florian.
174360	178060	Because the coins were nearly the exact same, both being made of gold and minted at nearly
178060	182440	an identical weight, the two functioned largely as interchangeable across the Byzantine and
182440	186880	Holy Roman Empires from the 13th century through to the 16th, reaching such common use that
186880	190240	a host of other European cities ended up minting the coins.
190240	194640	These currencies weren't forced on the rest of Europe by Venice or Florence—instead,
194640	198800	unlike local currencies, they consistently held their value, they could be trusted, and
198800	203020	because they rode the coattails of their originator's successful trade across an ever-expanding
203020	204020	network, they were prevalent.
204020	208080	If a genuine boatmaker was seeking funding from a genuine bank, the unit of account would
208080	209080	be in Florians.
209080	213420	If a Venetian merchant sought to buy salt in Servia or Avenia and then sell on to their
213420	216200	inland neighbors, the transactions would be in Ducats.
216200	220360	If the business was big enough to involve the era's fledgling banks, or city-state
220360	224360	governments, or trade from any of the dizzying array of tiny kingdoms dawdling the bustling
224360	229120	Mediterranean, it was done not by the local currency, but the common currency—the one
229120	233580	that both parties trusted, and both parties could get their hands on—the Florian or
233580	235520	its twin, the Ducat.
235520	239760	Then, the Western world got a whole lot bigger, and the dominant lanes of trade shifted from
239760	241880	the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.
241880	246440	The center of this newly global network moved west too, as the Iberian Peninsula unseated
246440	249660	Italian city-states as the world's economic hub.
249660	253440	While fabled cities of gold never materialized in the new world, Portuguese explorers and
253440	258680	Spanish conquistadores westward expansion opened an era of truly global trade.
258680	262260	And when they did stumble into mountains of silver in present-day Bolivia, it was all
262260	268320	but assured that the new dominant currency, the world over, would be the Spanish Real.
268320	271920	With the opening of the Potosí silver mines and the coinciding consolidation of territory
271920	276780	across Europe, a flood of carefully managed Spanish coins now made its way through the
276780	279440	Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe.
279440	283240	On a bigger scale, the Real did what the Florian did before it, becoming the world's most
283240	289360	readily available, reliable option for commercial transactions, but this time, the world over.
289360	293340	In Britain's North American colonies, for instance, the Spanish dollar maintained popularity
293340	296760	throughout the 1700s because it was far more accessible.
297120	300200	While pounds were difficult to physically obtain, merchants imported goods from the
300200	305060	West Indies by paying with comparatively prevalent Spanish currency, continuing to do so even
305060	306960	after American independence.
306960	310840	Even though the Spanish Empire reached its peak in the 1500s, ceding territory and power
310840	316000	for the following two centuries, its silver coinage remained a mainstay across the colonies
316000	318080	because it was too convenient.
318080	322320	But the Real's staying power as reserve currency proved shorter in Europe, as the
322320	326840	land-poor but ever-innovative Dutch provided an alternative for European traders in the
326840	328460	form of the Gilder.
328460	332320	With arguably the first central bank protecting Dutch currency from debasement, and the world's
332320	335920	first corporate entity establishing the state as the most powerful of trade partners, the
335920	339600	Dutch money quickly became Europe's most trustworthy currency.
339600	343320	While not the globetrotting empire the size of Spain's or Britain's that would follow,
343320	348200	Dutch Gilders were so stable in value, and so easy to transact with via notes and receipts,
348200	354040	that by the mid-18th century an estimated 85% of all European banks accepted Dutch currency
354040	355560	to settle claims.
355560	359560	Since the dawn of international trade, the currency of the conquerors, on account of
359560	365080	its reach and its steady value, became the global currency out of convenience, sometimes
365080	370120	holding onto that top spot long after the sun had set on the empire that created them.
370120	374040	Through such convenience, they became the period's de facto reserve currency, the
374040	379240	form of money that banks and businesses would hold onto to facilitate international transactions.
379240	383120	With the arrival of nation-states, central banks, and paper money, the conqueror's
383120	389320	cash still ruled, but now its status as a world reserve became codified.
389320	393480	Like dominant currencies before it, the pound sterling rode the territorial expansion of
393480	397920	the British empire, the rapid commercial success wrought by industrialization, and the meteoric
397920	401280	rise of its capital city to the top of the financial world.
401280	405640	With global reach and demand, central banks around the world began to hoover up pounds
405640	409200	as it would facilitate trade quickly with the world's largest power, it stood little
409200	413040	risk of losing value, and it could easily be reinvested back into the world's most
413040	417440	dynamic banking environment in London to further its value in the long term.
417440	421880	Central banks the world over trusted the pound as a store of value, and found it so useful
421880	428400	to facilitate international trade that by 1900, the pound accounted for 62% of the world's
428400	429400	reserve currency.
429400	433960	But the pound's era of dominance, like those before it, wouldn't last.
433960	438080	With the US controlling the lion's share of the world's gold after World War II,
438080	441600	international trade, and therefore central bank reserves, moved to the US dollar.
441600	444920	While the specifics of the arrangement have changed as the dollars moved off the gold
444920	449680	standard, it has remained the unquestioned international trade currency decade after
449680	454920	decade after decade until now.
454920	461140	In recent years, events cascaded into a barrage of questions over whether 2023 marks the beginning
461140	466120	of the end for the US dollar, and while hardly the cause—the trigger, at least—was of
466120	471060	Vladimir Putin's decision to send his country's troops on an illegal, unprovoked invasion
471060	472060	of Ukraine.
472060	477960	In the view of most, this required consequences—but only medium-sized ones.
477960	482920	After all, Russia is a nuclear power with a massive military and irrational, volatile
482920	487520	leadership, so rather than engaging in physical warfare, the West confined their actions to
487520	489360	economic warfare.
489360	492320	But this battlefield was bizarrely confined to the US.
492320	497280	You see, in the global financial system, the United States has a degree of jurisdiction
497280	502080	if US financial infrastructure is used, if US banking institutions are used, if US companies
502080	507120	are involved, if US nationals are involved, or even if the US dollar is used.
507120	511560	That's to say, given the centrality of the dollar in global finance, the US has near
511560	514400	total jurisdiction over global finance.
514400	519380	If it wants to cut off financial flows anywhere, it almost certainly can.
519380	523880	It is for this reason why a US sanction is essentially a global sanction.
523880	527600	For example, when the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions
527600	532560	on Iran in 2018, European Union nations were still free to do business with the country,
532560	536920	but in order to do so, they would need to avoid interacting with US banks, US companies,
536920	540720	or the US dollar, which was near impossible.
540720	549000	Italy cratered a full 92.8% between 2018 and 2019, even though it was completely legal.
549000	552400	Western countries concurred quite a bit more on the US's implementation of sanctions
552400	558120	against Russia, but the scale and severity of these financial penalties was massive.
558120	564620	The US was able to easily and almost immediately immobilize, freeze, or seize some $330 billion
564620	569320	in Russian money in the US and abroad, and play a part in freezing half of Russia's
569320	573100	global bank reserves, but it didn't stop there—thanks to the US International Emergency
573100	578640	Economic Powers Act, it was able to physically seize assets far outside the United States.
578640	583720	For example, Fijian authorities seized a $300 million yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman
583720	588000	Karimov on the US's behalf, since the Russian owner routed payments for the ship's maintenance
588000	590640	and operations through the American financial system.
590640	595040	Now, few outside of Russia and its allies debated the merits of these sanctions, but
595040	599940	their extent and efficacy led certain nations, especially those sitting in the vast gray
599940	605200	area between ally and enemy, to ask whether this was too great a power to bestow to a
605200	606360	single country.
606360	610900	It's the same debate as with any powerful weapon—the mere existence of a nuclear bomb
610900	616220	is worth questioning no matter who holds it—and yet in this case, there was a way to take
616220	621400	oneself outside of the range of this economic warhead.
621400	624760	Russia fired first, but this time out of necessity.
624760	629080	Or put another way, Russian trading partners set up systems to allow the country to circumvent
629080	633460	the sanctions placed to punish them for the unprovoked invasion of a sovereign nation.
633460	636200	China led the charge on this side of the equation.
636200	640200	Trading volume between the Russian ruble and the Chinese yuan spiked massively as the nation
640200	644840	offered its financial system up as an origin, destination, and intermediary for Russian
644840	645840	money.
645840	649580	After all, the direct financial connections, circumventing the Western swift payment system
649580	653940	that Russia could no longer use, were actually already in place.
653940	657940	China had started a concerted push in 2010 to internationalize the yuan as an alternative
657940	661460	to the dollar, and Russia was a willing partner in this mission.
661460	666420	This situation has been emulated elsewhere—Russia and Iran are progressively connecting their
666420	672100	financial systems, and now pay for 60% of their bilateral trade in ruble or real.
672100	677020	Argentina, facing a historic drought and therefore low exports and therefore a reduced inflow
677020	681540	of dollars, agreed to start trading with China in yuan in order to safeguard its dwindling
681540	683180	dollar reserves.
683180	686900	Brazil struck a similar agreement, and the São Paulo branch of the Industrial and Commercial
686900	691360	Bank of China started to act as an overseas hub to settle yuan-denominated transactions
691360	692540	with the country.
692540	697260	But the de-dollarization push with perhaps the strongest potential comes not from one
697260	704460	nation, but from a collection of them—BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
704460	709400	Now, this was originally a mere acronym to describe the five fast-growing nations expected
709400	713840	to dominate the global economy by 2050, but in recent years the group has metamorphosed
713840	717740	into a loose intergovernmental organization similar to the G7.
717740	722100	In fact, in many ways, considering their growing influence and lack of overlap with the G7
722100	726380	member nations, they're considered a rival to the more Western organization, and BRICS
726380	731760	is now seriously discussing the potential of creating a new international currency specifically
731760	734140	for the purpose of dollar-free trade.
734140	738460	In fact, it's expected to be the central topic for the upcoming BRICS summit in August
738460	740100	2023.
740100	743420	Economists agree that, at least on paper, given the scale of their economies, their
743420	747500	trade surplus, and the willingness of dozens of other countries to sign on to such an effort,
747500	752540	a BRICS currency might pose the strongest challenge yet to the dollar's reign.
752540	755340	But is any of this actually happening?
755340	760460	Is the world actually rejecting the dollar, or is this just one big media hype cycle—a
760460	765500	convenient configuration of facts that collectively make for a click-inducing headline?
765500	768100	After all, that's certainly happened before.
768100	772440	As European Union countries bound their economies together to create the euro, many speculated
772440	776900	that an inherently international currency would naturally grow into the global reserve
776900	778740	currency, usurping the dollar.
778740	781600	But then it just… didn't.
781600	785860	After initial growth and international use relative to the US dollar, euro reserve volume
785860	791100	plateaued, stymied by the European debt crisis, the lack of UK integration into the system,
791100	795520	and ultimately lower confidence in the currency's stability relative to the US dollar.
795520	800860	But today, beyond the rhetoric, there is some evidence that can be used to say a de-dollarization
800860	802900	trend is occurring.
802900	808420	Most directly, the share of central bank reserves accounted for by US dollars has declined since
808420	809420	its peak.
809420	812900	But this share has always ebbed and flowed, and today's share is not outside the normal
812900	817860	range, so the question is whether today's downward trend is truly the start of a long
817860	823540	downward slide into oblivion, or just another hype-cycle-inducing data anomaly.
823540	828580	Well, what might answer that is another question—where would the money go?
828580	833260	There has never not been a definitive global reserve currency in modern times, so barring
833260	838020	the unlikely but theoretically possible fragmentation of the global economic system in a way that
838020	843100	has never happened before, something would have to replace the US dollar.
843100	847820	A theoretical BRICS currency, despite its potential to challenge the US dollar, faces
847820	852440	massive, likely insurmountable obstacles to usurping its spot at the top.
852440	857220	The first isn't actually happening—despite their increasing cooperation, BRICS nations
857220	859380	are hardly strong allies.
859380	864020	India and China's relationship is strained, at best, and regularly devolves into deadly
864020	866460	skirmishes over their disputed border.
866500	870240	Russia's belligerent status makes relations with it tricky.
870240	873760	Just now, South Africa is having to decide whether to comply with an International Criminal
873760	877720	Court arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin when he travels to the country for the upcoming
877720	881220	BRICS summit, or if to relocate the summit elsewhere.
881220	886040	In any geopolitical environment remotely similar to today's, a BRICS currency could likely
886040	890160	reach widescale use among these developing nations, but not much more as it would be
890160	895260	viewed as a tool for Russia to evade sanctions, and therefore, a tool to finance their war
895260	896260	efforts.
896260	899960	Western adoption would be low, and, even as BRICS nations grow their share of the world
899960	905700	economy, they alone could not force a currency to replace the US dollar globally.
905700	910560	Similarly, the Yuan has potential as China continues its march towards world's largest
910560	915060	economy status, but the uniqueness of the country's economic system makes it incompatible
915060	918840	for further integration with much of the rest of the world's.
918840	922580	Despite their efforts to internationalize the Yuan, there are still sizable restrictions
922580	925480	on moving money in and out of China.
925480	929700	Locals are only allowed to send $50,000 a year abroad without permission, and the view
929700	934580	is that this could not change without significantly damaging the country's economy.
934580	938180	China has accumulated a tremendous amount of wealth, and then propped up its economy
938180	940340	by keeping that wealth inside.
940340	944920	Considering how hard the country's mega-wealthy already work to get their money out, it seems
944920	949660	certain that relaxing these policies would lead to massive capital flight.
949660	954740	In reverse, there are massive restrictions on foreign access to Chinese financial markets—for
954740	958780	example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is largely closed to foreign investors.
958780	962800	The primary way to get access to it is through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program,
962800	966480	which allows investors to purchase Shanghai stocks through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
966480	970640	and vice versa, but there are restrictions in daily trading quotas, especially in the
970640	975940	southbound direction—and even this is a uniquely liberal access point to Chinese financial
975940	976940	markets.
976940	981480	The US dollar, in comparison, is about as open as a traditional currency can be.
981480	986460	There are essentially no meaningful restrictions on movement of dollars in and out of the country.
986460	990200	In fact, while it's surprisingly difficult to know for sure, somewhere between half and
990200	994620	three-quarters of US dollars are held outside of the United States.
994620	999620	It is exceedingly common for high-net-worth individuals and large multinational companies
999620	1004020	to have US-denominated bank accounts no matter where they are in the world, and therefore
1004020	1009920	US dollar to US dollar international transactions regularly occur without direct involvement
1009920	1011960	by a US bank.
1011960	1015880	While China is setting up mechanisms for a growing yuan trade abroad, the restrictions
1015880	1020300	on movement to and from the country make it nearly impossible for the yuan to meaningfully
1020300	1024960	challenge the dollar's international role, as access to a robust liquid capital market
1024960	1030700	is perhaps the key tenet of a reserve currency—it's an investment meant to emulate nearly all qualities
1030700	1035080	of one's domestic currency, so it must be transferable to the domestic currency nearly
1035080	1037700	immediately and without restriction.
1037700	1043240	Ultimately, there are two situations that could lead to the end of the US dollar's
1043240	1044300	international supremacy.
1044300	1048160	The first is the more traditional—if the American economy encounters a massive economic
1048160	1051900	collapse to the point where the dollar is no longer the safest store of value, then
1051900	1053740	capital will flee elsewhere.
1053740	1060700	But this would have to be massive, generation-defining, and likely isolated to the country itself,
1060700	1064540	rather than a global financial crisis that would make all currencies risky stores of
1064540	1065540	value.
1065540	1069720	This is, after all, how every other reserve currency before has fallen.
1069720	1075660	But today, with the powers unlocked by the modern financial system, there is a new option—the
1075660	1081240	forced option—the one that the current media hype cycle is based on.
1081240	1086660	Reserve currencies operate off a network effect—they're useful because everyone else uses them.
1086660	1090900	Right now, the majority of the world's economy agrees that the so-called weaponization of
1090900	1095740	the dollar is primarily being done for good, and this will likely stay this way.
1095740	1100640	Ultimately, the US can only use its economic weapon so much because the weapon is granted
1100640	1102660	to it by the rest of the world.
1102660	1106880	Someone's always going to have it, and so the rare case that could force you to change
1106880	1113060	hands is if there's overwhelming international consensus that the US is using it improperly—that
1113060	1117120	the US is meddling in global affairs thanks to dollar centrality.
1117120	1121720	It sure is that in today's tense geopolitical environment, those calls are growing louder,
1121720	1126620	but they're from a minority of nations, and the majority agrees that American action
1126620	1130040	is merely a reflection of international consensus.
1130040	1134300	That means there's always this implicit threat—if the US acts improperly, then
1134300	1138360	countries will move their reserves out of the dollar—that keeps America more or less
1138360	1141520	in line with the international consensus.
1141520	1146040	Rhetoric matters in this system, but the forces keeping the dollar in that top spot are just
1146040	1150840	so strong that the impetus for its fall would not be confined to the columns in the financial
1150840	1151840	section.
1151840	1157080	They'd be a fundamental shake-up of the world order—the fall of empires, the end
1157080	1161960	of American superpower status as we know it.
1161960	1166120	If you're anything like me, you're constantly wondering why it takes so much time or money
1166120	1167400	to eat right.
1167400	1172160	Our food supply is now as efficient as it's ever been, but typically there's this trade-off—almost
1172160	1176320	every meal option is either healthy and affordable but time-consuming, affordable and quick but
1176320	1179180	unhealthy, or quick and healthy but expensive.
1179180	1182840	A couple of years ago, I was trying to find a solution to this—the perfect triad of
1182840	1187400	healthy, quick, and affordable—and became a customer of what's come to be our sponsor,
1187400	1188400	HelloFresh.
1188400	1191800	The idea is pretty straightforward—you pick which meals you want to eat on their app or
1191800	1195480	website, then the next week, an insulated box shows up on your doorstep filled with
1195480	1199560	fresh, preportioned, partially-prepared ingredients so you can home-cook the meals far faster
1199560	1203360	than if you had wasted a lot of time planning, going to the grocery store, and prepping.
1203360	1207360	And not only that, you get everything you need in the right quantities you need—no
1207360	1211360	more throwing away extra ingredients you didn't use, raising both the environmental impact
1211360	1213120	and the cost of what you eat.
1213120	1216520	Oh, and best of all, the meals actually taste really good.
1216520	1220760	There's a reason I've used HelloFresh as a genuine customer, paying my actual money,
1220760	1225240	making meals like these delicious tropical teriyaki pork bowls for three years now—they
1225240	1228520	are just the best solution I've found for regular dinners.
1228520	1232600	If you want to see if I'm right and improve the way you eat, now's a great time because
1232600	1238420	you can go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER16 at checkout for 16 free meals plus
1238420	1238920	free shipping.
