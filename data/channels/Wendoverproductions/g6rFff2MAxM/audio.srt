1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
If an American wants to buy something in Britain, they'd need British Pounds.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,460
The easiest way to get Pounds is by finding a British person who wants to buy something

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,500
in America—they'd need US dollars.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,400
Each currency represents value that can be exchanged for goods and services, so the logic

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,320
follows that one can trade two facsimiles of value for each other, but the same can

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,400
be said for the Swedish Krona and the Samoan Tala.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,720
A certain number of each can be traded for, say, a gallon of gas in each country, and

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,280
yet the two cannot be traded for each other quite so easily.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,240
You see, Samoans only import about $19,000 of goods from Sweden each year, and Swedes

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,560
barely import anything from Samoa.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,920
Therefore, the likelihood of finding a Swede looking for Samoan Talas at a given time is

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,620
low, even if a certain number of Talas always corresponds to the same value as a certain

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,520
number of Krona—it's just an exchange barrier.

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,160
But the Samoan can get around this.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,480
Some $40 million flows between Samoa and the United States each year, meaning, at any given

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,120
time, there is almost certainly an American looking for Talas to pay for Samoan exports,

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,640
so they can transfer their Talas into dollars.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Then, some $25 billion in trade happens between the US and Sweden each year, so it's even

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,160
easier to convert dollars into Krona, meaning a full Talas to Krona transaction can take

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,600
place just via the US dollar.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,160
Not only has the transaction occurred faster than if one waited around for a willing Swede

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,280
to trade for Talas, it likely costs less since the Samoan didn't have to incentivize

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,840
demand through offering a higher-than-warranted number of Talas per Krona.

24
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,260
There are 180 UN-recognized currencies out there, meaning there are thousands upon thousands

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,200
of unique combinations of currency that can be exchanged.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Even at the scale of the global economy, this means it's not always easy to find a willing

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,520
partner to trade currency with when needed.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,360
Therefore, 88% of the time, currency transactions occur with the US dollar.

29
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,720
This doesn't mean 88% of transactions are ultimately from or for the US dollar, but

30
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,840
rather that it's often just easier to facilitate international transactions through the US dollar.

31
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,640
It's a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy—it's easiest to trade with the most traded currency,

32
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,340
and therefore the most traded currency is traded most.

33
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,640
These days, the US dollar serves that role—it is the plumbing of the global economy—but

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,380
that's a relatively new role.

35
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,240
Before the IMF or the WTO, before this century, last century, or the century prior, before

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,180
central banks or the concept of nations, there was trade—trade between states, trade across

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,740
kingdoms and fiefdoms, trade between tribes and clans.

38
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,700
In the West, as the world got bigger, the trade networks became more complex and the

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,620
means of trade centralized around currencies, and since the very beginning of modern trade,

40
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,700
there's always existed a currency that's just easier to do business with—a dominant

41
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:45,000
currency, a global currency, a reserve currency.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
The earliest coins connecting trade across Europe and the Near East originated first

43
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:54,360
in the merchant-heavy city-states of the Mediterranean—Venice's Ducat and Florence's Florian.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,060
Because the coins were nearly the exact same, both being made of gold and minted at nearly

45
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,440
an identical weight, the two functioned largely as interchangeable across the Byzantine and

46
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,880
Holy Roman Empires from the 13th century through to the 16th, reaching such common use that

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,240
a host of other European cities ended up minting the coins.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,640
These currencies weren't forced on the rest of Europe by Venice or Florence—instead,

49
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
unlike local currencies, they consistently held their value, they could be trusted, and

50
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,020
because they rode the coattails of their originator's successful trade across an ever-expanding

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,020
network, they were prevalent.

52
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,080
If a genuine boatmaker was seeking funding from a genuine bank, the unit of account would

53
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
be in Florians.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,420
If a Venetian merchant sought to buy salt in Servia or Avenia and then sell on to their

55
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,200
inland neighbors, the transactions would be in Ducats.

56
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,360
If the business was big enough to involve the era's fledgling banks, or city-state

57
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,360
governments, or trade from any of the dizzying array of tiny kingdoms dawdling the bustling

58
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,120
Mediterranean, it was done not by the local currency, but the common currency—the one

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,580
that both parties trusted, and both parties could get their hands on—the Florian or

60
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,520
its twin, the Ducat.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,760
Then, the Western world got a whole lot bigger, and the dominant lanes of trade shifted from

62
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,880
the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,440
The center of this newly global network moved west too, as the Iberian Peninsula unseated

64
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,660
Italian city-states as the world's economic hub.

65
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,440
While fabled cities of gold never materialized in the new world, Portuguese explorers and

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,680
Spanish conquistadores westward expansion opened an era of truly global trade.

67
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,260
And when they did stumble into mountains of silver in present-day Bolivia, it was all

68
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,320
but assured that the new dominant currency, the world over, would be the Spanish Real.

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,920
With the opening of the Potosí silver mines and the coinciding consolidation of territory

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,780
across Europe, a flood of carefully managed Spanish coins now made its way through the

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,440
Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe.

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,240
On a bigger scale, the Real did what the Florian did before it, becoming the world's most

73
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,360
readily available, reliable option for commercial transactions, but this time, the world over.

74
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,340
In Britain's North American colonies, for instance, the Spanish dollar maintained popularity

75
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,760
throughout the 1700s because it was far more accessible.

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,200
While pounds were difficult to physically obtain, merchants imported goods from the

77
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,060
West Indies by paying with comparatively prevalent Spanish currency, continuing to do so even

78
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,960
after American independence.

79
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,840
Even though the Spanish Empire reached its peak in the 1500s, ceding territory and power

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,000
for the following two centuries, its silver coinage remained a mainstay across the colonies

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
because it was too convenient.

82
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,320
But the Real's staying power as reserve currency proved shorter in Europe, as the

83
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,840
land-poor but ever-innovative Dutch provided an alternative for European traders in the

84
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,460
form of the Gilder.

85
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,320
With arguably the first central bank protecting Dutch currency from debasement, and the world's

86
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,920
first corporate entity establishing the state as the most powerful of trade partners, the

87
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,600
Dutch money quickly became Europe's most trustworthy currency.

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,320
While not the globetrotting empire the size of Spain's or Britain's that would follow,

89
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,200
Dutch Gilders were so stable in value, and so easy to transact with via notes and receipts,

90
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,040
that by the mid-18th century an estimated 85% of all European banks accepted Dutch currency

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,560
to settle claims.

92
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Since the dawn of international trade, the currency of the conquerors, on account of

93
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:05,080
its reach and its steady value, became the global currency out of convenience, sometimes

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,120
holding onto that top spot long after the sun had set on the empire that created them.

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,040
Through such convenience, they became the period's de facto reserve currency, the

96
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,240
form of money that banks and businesses would hold onto to facilitate international transactions.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,120
With the arrival of nation-states, central banks, and paper money, the conqueror's

98
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,320
cash still ruled, but now its status as a world reserve became codified.

99
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,480
Like dominant currencies before it, the pound sterling rode the territorial expansion of

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,920
the British empire, the rapid commercial success wrought by industrialization, and the meteoric

101
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,280
rise of its capital city to the top of the financial world.

102
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,640
With global reach and demand, central banks around the world began to hoover up pounds

103
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,200
as it would facilitate trade quickly with the world's largest power, it stood little

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,040
risk of losing value, and it could easily be reinvested back into the world's most

105
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,440
dynamic banking environment in London to further its value in the long term.

106
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,880
Central banks the world over trusted the pound as a store of value, and found it so useful

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,400
to facilitate international trade that by 1900, the pound accounted for 62% of the world's

108
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
reserve currency.

109
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,960
But the pound's era of dominance, like those before it, wouldn't last.

110
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,080
With the US controlling the lion's share of the world's gold after World War II,

111
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,600
international trade, and therefore central bank reserves, moved to the US dollar.

112
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,920
While the specifics of the arrangement have changed as the dollars moved off the gold

113
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,680
standard, it has remained the unquestioned international trade currency decade after

114
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,920
decade after decade until now.

115
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:41,140
In recent years, events cascaded into a barrage of questions over whether 2023 marks the beginning

116
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,120
of the end for the US dollar, and while hardly the cause—the trigger, at least—was of

117
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,060
Vladimir Putin's decision to send his country's troops on an illegal, unprovoked invasion

118
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,060
of Ukraine.

119
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,960
In the view of most, this required consequences—but only medium-sized ones.

120
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,920
After all, Russia is a nuclear power with a massive military and irrational, volatile

121
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,520
leadership, so rather than engaging in physical warfare, the West confined their actions to

122
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
economic warfare.

123
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,320
But this battlefield was bizarrely confined to the US.

124
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,280
You see, in the global financial system, the United States has a degree of jurisdiction

125
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,080
if US financial infrastructure is used, if US banking institutions are used, if US companies

126
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,120
are involved, if US nationals are involved, or even if the US dollar is used.

127
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,560
That's to say, given the centrality of the dollar in global finance, the US has near

128
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,400
total jurisdiction over global finance.

129
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,380
If it wants to cut off financial flows anywhere, it almost certainly can.

130
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,880
It is for this reason why a US sanction is essentially a global sanction.

131
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,600
For example, when the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reinstated sanctions

132
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,560
on Iran in 2018, European Union nations were still free to do business with the country,

133
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,920
but in order to do so, they would need to avoid interacting with US banks, US companies,

134
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,720
or the US dollar, which was near impossible.

135
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,000
Italy cratered a full 92.8% between 2018 and 2019, even though it was completely legal.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,400
Western countries concurred quite a bit more on the US's implementation of sanctions

137
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,120
against Russia, but the scale and severity of these financial penalties was massive.

138
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,620
The US was able to easily and almost immediately immobilize, freeze, or seize some $330 billion

139
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,320
in Russian money in the US and abroad, and play a part in freezing half of Russia's

140
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,100
global bank reserves, but it didn't stop there—thanks to the US International Emergency

141
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,640
Economic Powers Act, it was able to physically seize assets far outside the United States.

142
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,720
For example, Fijian authorities seized a $300 million yacht owned by Russian oligarch Suleiman

143
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,000
Karimov on the US's behalf, since the Russian owner routed payments for the ship's maintenance

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,640
and operations through the American financial system.

145
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,040
Now, few outside of Russia and its allies debated the merits of these sanctions, but

146
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,940
their extent and efficacy led certain nations, especially those sitting in the vast gray

147
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,200
area between ally and enemy, to ask whether this was too great a power to bestow to a

148
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,360
single country.

149
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,900
It's the same debate as with any powerful weapon—the mere existence of a nuclear bomb

150
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,220
is worth questioning no matter who holds it—and yet in this case, there was a way to take

151
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,400
oneself outside of the range of this economic warhead.

152
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,760
Russia fired first, but this time out of necessity.

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,080
Or put another way, Russian trading partners set up systems to allow the country to circumvent

154
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:33,460
the sanctions placed to punish them for the unprovoked invasion of a sovereign nation.

155
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,200
China led the charge on this side of the equation.

156
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
Trading volume between the Russian ruble and the Chinese yuan spiked massively as the nation

157
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,840
offered its financial system up as an origin, destination, and intermediary for Russian

158
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
money.

159
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,580
After all, the direct financial connections, circumventing the Western swift payment system

160
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,940
that Russia could no longer use, were actually already in place.

161
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,940
China had started a concerted push in 2010 to internationalize the yuan as an alternative

162
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,460
to the dollar, and Russia was a willing partner in this mission.

163
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:06,420
This situation has been emulated elsewhere—Russia and Iran are progressively connecting their

164
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,100
financial systems, and now pay for 60% of their bilateral trade in ruble or real.

165
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,020
Argentina, facing a historic drought and therefore low exports and therefore a reduced inflow

166
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,540
of dollars, agreed to start trading with China in yuan in order to safeguard its dwindling

167
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,180
dollar reserves.

168
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,900
Brazil struck a similar agreement, and the São Paulo branch of the Industrial and Commercial

169
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,360
Bank of China started to act as an overseas hub to settle yuan-denominated transactions

170
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,540
with the country.

171
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,260
But the de-dollarization push with perhaps the strongest potential comes not from one

172
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:44,460
nation, but from a collection of them—BRICS—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.

173
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,400
Now, this was originally a mere acronym to describe the five fast-growing nations expected

174
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,840
to dominate the global economy by 2050, but in recent years the group has metamorphosed

175
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,740
into a loose intergovernmental organization similar to the G7.

176
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:02,100
In fact, in many ways, considering their growing influence and lack of overlap with the G7

177
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,380
member nations, they're considered a rival to the more Western organization, and BRICS

178
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,760
is now seriously discussing the potential of creating a new international currency specifically

179
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,140
for the purpose of dollar-free trade.

180
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,460
In fact, it's expected to be the central topic for the upcoming BRICS summit in August

181
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,100
2023.

182
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,420
Economists agree that, at least on paper, given the scale of their economies, their

183
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:27,500
trade surplus, and the willingness of dozens of other countries to sign on to such an effort,

184
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,540
a BRICS currency might pose the strongest challenge yet to the dollar's reign.

185
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,340
But is any of this actually happening?

186
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,460
Is the world actually rejecting the dollar, or is this just one big media hype cycle—a

187
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,500
convenient configuration of facts that collectively make for a click-inducing headline?

188
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,100
After all, that's certainly happened before.

189
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,440
As European Union countries bound their economies together to create the euro, many speculated

190
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,900
that an inherently international currency would naturally grow into the global reserve

191
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,740
currency, usurping the dollar.

192
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,600
But then it just… didn't.

193
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,860
After initial growth and international use relative to the US dollar, euro reserve volume

194
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,100
plateaued, stymied by the European debt crisis, the lack of UK integration into the system,

195
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,520
and ultimately lower confidence in the currency's stability relative to the US dollar.

196
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,860
But today, beyond the rhetoric, there is some evidence that can be used to say a de-dollarization

197
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,900
trend is occurring.

198
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,420
Most directly, the share of central bank reserves accounted for by US dollars has declined since

199
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,420
its peak.

200
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,900
But this share has always ebbed and flowed, and today's share is not outside the normal

201
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,860
range, so the question is whether today's downward trend is truly the start of a long

202
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,540
downward slide into oblivion, or just another hype-cycle-inducing data anomaly.

203
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,580
Well, what might answer that is another question—where would the money go?

204
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,260
There has never not been a definitive global reserve currency in modern times, so barring

205
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,020
the unlikely but theoretically possible fragmentation of the global economic system in a way that

206
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,100
has never happened before, something would have to replace the US dollar.

207
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,820
A theoretical BRICS currency, despite its potential to challenge the US dollar, faces

208
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,440
massive, likely insurmountable obstacles to usurping its spot at the top.

209
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,220
The first isn't actually happening—despite their increasing cooperation, BRICS nations

210
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,380
are hardly strong allies.

211
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,020
India and China's relationship is strained, at best, and regularly devolves into deadly

212
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,460
skirmishes over their disputed border.

213
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,240
Russia's belligerent status makes relations with it tricky.

214
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
Just now, South Africa is having to decide whether to comply with an International Criminal

215
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,720
Court arrest warrant for Vladimir Putin when he travels to the country for the upcoming

216
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,220
BRICS summit, or if to relocate the summit elsewhere.

217
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:46,040
In any geopolitical environment remotely similar to today's, a BRICS currency could likely

218
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,160
reach widescale use among these developing nations, but not much more as it would be

219
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,260
viewed as a tool for Russia to evade sanctions, and therefore, a tool to finance their war

220
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,260
efforts.

221
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,960
Western adoption would be low, and, even as BRICS nations grow their share of the world

222
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,700
economy, they alone could not force a currency to replace the US dollar globally.

223
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,560
Similarly, the Yuan has potential as China continues its march towards world's largest

224
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,060
economy status, but the uniqueness of the country's economic system makes it incompatible

225
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,840
for further integration with much of the rest of the world's.

226
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,580
Despite their efforts to internationalize the Yuan, there are still sizable restrictions

227
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,480
on moving money in and out of China.

228
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,700
Locals are only allowed to send $50,000 a year abroad without permission, and the view

229
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,580
is that this could not change without significantly damaging the country's economy.

230
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,180
China has accumulated a tremendous amount of wealth, and then propped up its economy

231
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,340
by keeping that wealth inside.

232
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,920
Considering how hard the country's mega-wealthy already work to get their money out, it seems

233
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,660
certain that relaxing these policies would lead to massive capital flight.

234
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:54,740
In reverse, there are massive restrictions on foreign access to Chinese financial markets—for

235
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,780
example, the Shanghai Stock Exchange is largely closed to foreign investors.

236
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,800
The primary way to get access to it is through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect program,

237
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,480
which allows investors to purchase Shanghai stocks through the Hong Kong Stock Exchange

238
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,640
and vice versa, but there are restrictions in daily trading quotas, especially in the

239
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,940
southbound direction—and even this is a uniquely liberal access point to Chinese financial

240
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
markets.

241
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,480
The US dollar, in comparison, is about as open as a traditional currency can be.

242
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:26,460
There are essentially no meaningful restrictions on movement of dollars in and out of the country.

243
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,200
In fact, while it's surprisingly difficult to know for sure, somewhere between half and

244
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,620
three-quarters of US dollars are held outside of the United States.

245
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,620
It is exceedingly common for high-net-worth individuals and large multinational companies

246
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,020
to have US-denominated bank accounts no matter where they are in the world, and therefore

247
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,920
US dollar to US dollar international transactions regularly occur without direct involvement

248
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,960
by a US bank.

249
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,880
While China is setting up mechanisms for a growing yuan trade abroad, the restrictions

250
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,300
on movement to and from the country make it nearly impossible for the yuan to meaningfully

251
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,960
challenge the dollar's international role, as access to a robust liquid capital market

252
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,700
is perhaps the key tenet of a reserve currency—it's an investment meant to emulate nearly all qualities

253
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,080
of one's domestic currency, so it must be transferable to the domestic currency nearly

254
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,700
immediately and without restriction.

255
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:23,240
Ultimately, there are two situations that could lead to the end of the US dollar's

256
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,300
international supremacy.

257
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,160
The first is the more traditional—if the American economy encounters a massive economic

258
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,900
collapse to the point where the dollar is no longer the safest store of value, then

259
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,740
capital will flee elsewhere.

260
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,700
But this would have to be massive, generation-defining, and likely isolated to the country itself,

261
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,540
rather than a global financial crisis that would make all currencies risky stores of

262
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
value.

263
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,720
This is, after all, how every other reserve currency before has fallen.

264
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,660
But today, with the powers unlocked by the modern financial system, there is a new option—the

265
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,240
forced option—the one that the current media hype cycle is based on.

266
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,660
Reserve currencies operate off a network effect—they're useful because everyone else uses them.

267
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,900
Right now, the majority of the world's economy agrees that the so-called weaponization of

268
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,740
the dollar is primarily being done for good, and this will likely stay this way.

269
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,640
Ultimately, the US can only use its economic weapon so much because the weapon is granted

270
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,660
to it by the rest of the world.

271
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,880
Someone's always going to have it, and so the rare case that could force you to change

272
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,060
hands is if there's overwhelming international consensus that the US is using it improperly—that

273
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,120
the US is meddling in global affairs thanks to dollar centrality.

274
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,720
It sure is that in today's tense geopolitical environment, those calls are growing louder,

275
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,620
but they're from a minority of nations, and the majority agrees that American action

276
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,040
is merely a reflection of international consensus.

277
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,300
That means there's always this implicit threat—if the US acts improperly, then

278
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,360
countries will move their reserves out of the dollar—that keeps America more or less

279
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,520
in line with the international consensus.

280
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,040
Rhetoric matters in this system, but the forces keeping the dollar in that top spot are just

281
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,840
so strong that the impetus for its fall would not be confined to the columns in the financial

282
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
section.

283
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,080
They'd be a fundamental shake-up of the world order—the fall of empires, the end

284
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,960
of American superpower status as we know it.

285
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,120
If you're anything like me, you're constantly wondering why it takes so much time or money

286
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,400
to eat right.

287
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,160
Our food supply is now as efficient as it's ever been, but typically there's this trade-off—almost

288
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,320
every meal option is either healthy and affordable but time-consuming, affordable and quick but

289
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,180
unhealthy, or quick and healthy but expensive.

290
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:42,840
A couple of years ago, I was trying to find a solution to this—the perfect triad of

291
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,400
healthy, quick, and affordable—and became a customer of what's come to be our sponsor,

292
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
HelloFresh.

293
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,800
The idea is pretty straightforward—you pick which meals you want to eat on their app or

294
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,480
website, then the next week, an insulated box shows up on your doorstep filled with

295
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,560
fresh, preportioned, partially-prepared ingredients so you can home-cook the meals far faster

296
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,360
than if you had wasted a lot of time planning, going to the grocery store, and prepping.

297
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,360
And not only that, you get everything you need in the right quantities you need—no

298
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,360
more throwing away extra ingredients you didn't use, raising both the environmental impact

299
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,120
and the cost of what you eat.

300
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,520
Oh, and best of all, the meals actually taste really good.

301
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,760
There's a reason I've used HelloFresh as a genuine customer, paying my actual money,

302
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,240
making meals like these delicious tropical teriyaki pork bowls for three years now—they

303
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,520
are just the best solution I've found for regular dinners.

304
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,600
If you want to see if I'm right and improve the way you eat, now's a great time because

you can go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER16 at checkout for 16 free meals plus
