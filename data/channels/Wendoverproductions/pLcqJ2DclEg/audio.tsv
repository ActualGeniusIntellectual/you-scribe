15580	19460	With any disruptive technology, there's a tipping point.
19460	24440	There is a point in time when its path towards market dominance is a certainty.
24440	28640	Now, electric vehicles are almost certainly a disruptive technology.
29080	33720	They're almost certainly a technology that will, with time, become dominant over their
33720	34720	predecessor.
34720	39680	In this case, the predecessor is the internal combustion car that you, yourself, almost
39680	41400	certainly use.
41400	46320	Chances are, though, when asked, you'd say that your next car will not be electric, and
46320	51340	you're right—the average consumer, according to surveys, would not even consider purchasing
51340	56120	an electric vehicle, demonstrating that the technology is not yet at the tipping point
56120	58800	where it's on a certain path towards market dominance.
58800	63280	But again, that path is almost certain.
63280	68720	EVs are not there yet—right now they're too expensive, too short-range, and too slow
68720	71240	to charge—but they're close.
71240	75120	In fact, research can quantify just how close they are.
75120	80000	It's been shown that the tipping point price for EVs—the price that will lead to mainstream
80000	85200	adoption and eventual disruption—is $36,000.
85280	89680	Taking a look at the prices of the base models of three of the world's best-selling electric
89680	94200	vehicles, they're already roughly there, so we know that that's not what's holding
94200	96640	mass-market consumers back.
96640	99760	What also matters is range.
99760	107280	Consumers say they need 291 miles or 469 kilometers of it before the cars can go mass-market.
107280	113080	Two of the best-selling EVs—the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevy Volt EV—are not far from
113080	116060	different, while the Nissan Leaf lags behind.
116060	120120	Range and cost are closely linked, and you can essentially trade one off for the other,
120120	123600	as the battery is the single largest cost of an EV.
123600	128840	That's why the industry is so focused on innovating and scaling to lower the component
128840	132080	cost of EV batteries, and it's working.
132080	139040	In 2013, the average price per kilowatt-hour of an EV battery was $668, meaning the base
139040	145440	model Tesla Model 3's 50 kilowatt-hour battery would cost $22,400—two-thirds of what the
145440	146960	vehicle sells for.
146960	152940	Nowadays, the average price per kilowatt-hour is all the way down to $137, meaning that
152940	158680	same battery pack would cost just $6,850, and this price per kilowatt-hour is expected
158680	161320	to lower to $100 by 2023.
161320	166280	It's getting more and more possible for manufacturers to sell an EV for the magic
166280	170520	$36,000 price with the magic 291-mile range.
170520	176000	While EVs are not quite there yet, they're really not far, and will be there in the next
176000	177160	few years.
177160	182760	So, range is not what's significantly holding mass-market consumers back, and it won't
182760	185540	be at all within a few years.
185540	188080	What is, though, is charging.
188080	191800	The research shows that consumers want to be able to charge their cars from empty to
191800	197980	full in 31 minutes, and that's the magic number for mass-market adoption.
197980	203900	With this, current $36,000 EVs just aren't yet there.
203900	208500	The base model Chevy Volt EV can't even fast-charge—it doesn't have the technology
208500	213800	for it—and even the upgraded, more expensive model that does allow for fast-charging can
213800	217820	only get to 39% state of charge in 31 minutes.
217820	223420	The Nissan Leaf does a little better, attaining 62% state of charge in 31 minutes, while the
223420	228820	base model Tesla Model 3 does the best with its ability to fill its battery to 83% in
228820	233420	the most ideal conditions using the fastest models of Tesla Superchargers, but that would
233420	240240	only give it 196 miles or 315 kilometers of range, again in the most ideal conditions.
240240	244620	In colder weather, both that charging time would be greater, and that range would be
244620	245620	less.
245620	250060	So, it's currently possible to get an EV with just about what the mass-market requires
250060	256880	for cost and range, but reaching that charging time, that's just a lot tougher.
256880	261920	What this research can lead us to conclude is that the largest barrier right now to mass-market
261920	265900	EV adoption is, in fact, the charging problem.
265900	272100	The tipping point just will not happen without widespread fast-charging, but widespread fast-charging
272100	277860	is just difficult because of the very way our electric grid works.
277860	284140	You see, back in the 1880s, Thomas Edison, with his direct current electric system, battled
284140	288440	it out with George Westinghouse and his alternating current system.
288440	294040	As the names suggest, direct current electricity flows consistently and unidirectionally, while
294040	298580	alternating current oscillates in magnitude and rapidly changes direction.
298580	303420	The exact details of how each works isn't that important in this context, but what is
303420	308340	is to know that, for a variety of reasons, AC power won, it's now the standard for
308340	313620	power grids, but there are certain technologies that still need DC power.
313620	320420	The most widespread example of that is batteries—you cannot charge a battery using AC power.
320420	325260	That's why you don't plug your smartphone directly into an outlet—you plug it into
325260	331880	a power brick that plugs into an outlet, and that power brick is an AC to DC converter.
331880	336580	A standard iPhone charging inverter outputs 5 watts of electricity, which is plenty enough
336580	340300	to charge the phone's 11 watt-hour battery in a few hours.
340300	348820	A base-model Tesla Model 3, meanwhile, has a 50 kilowatt-hour battery—4,500 times larger.
349220	355540	Therefore, it needs a much higher wattage power inverter to charge with any speed.
355540	358600	It solves this in two ways.
358600	363860	Onboard that Model 3, there's a 7.7 kilowatt inverter that can take AC power from common
363860	369360	sources, like a standard wall outlet, and convert it into DC power to charge the battery.
369360	374280	At its max rate, this can charge the car fully in under 10 hours, and has the advantage of
374280	378840	allowing consumers to charge using regular wall plugs or by installing relatively inexpensive
378840	382520	chargers on existing domestic AC electric circuits.
382520	388480	The disadvantage, though, is that while 7.7 kilowatts is plenty fast enough for regular,
388480	392800	overnight at-home charging, it's not fast enough to compete with the convenience of
392800	395920	filling up an internal combustion car at the gas station.
395920	400700	It's not fast enough if you're on a long-distance trip and need to be able to gain hundreds
400700	403760	of miles of range in a matter of minutes.
404120	410560	So, if you need more electricity faster, you need a higher wattage inverter.
410560	415840	To be able to take a Tesla Model 3 from almost empty to almost full in 30 minutes, you want
415840	419200	between 120 and 250 kilowatts.
419200	427960	The problem, though, is that a 250 kilowatt inverter costs, at least in this case, $57,600,
427960	431160	and is about the size of a very large fridge.
431200	436080	It's not exactly practical to have this as an internal component of the car.
436080	441680	So, for faster charging, one needs to off-board the inversion process.
441680	449520	That's exactly what a DC fast charger does—it supplies a huge quantity of DC power to the
449520	454560	car, which bypasses the onboard inverter and charges the battery directly.
454560	458800	Between the inverter, the charger, and all the other equipment needed for a fast-charging
459320	463180	the cost and size is not insignificant.
463180	468160	One of the more popular models, the Chargepoint Express 250, which can charge a single car
468160	475840	at a somewhat slow 62.5 kilowatts, sells for $40,800, and that's before installation.
475840	481640	Meanwhile, while it's tough to get an exact figure, industry experts estimate it costs
481640	488240	Tesla about $250,000 to build an average supercharging station with six to eight stalls delivering
488240	494680	120 to 150 kilowatts each, while its closest equivalent, the stations by Volkswagen's
494680	499520	Electrify America, are estimated to cost $350,000.
499520	502680	But here's something counterintuitive.
502680	510560	Using a 250 kilowatt charger versus a 150 kilowatt one doesn't really impact how fast
510560	512060	you charge.
512060	517760	Batteries charge slower the more full they are, so the first 20% will pass far faster
518280	520000	than the last 20%.
520000	525240	In the context of EV charging, this means that quite quickly into the charge, the speed
525240	530380	is impacted not by how much power the station is putting out, but by how much electricity
530380	531960	the battery can accept.
531960	538280	So, it's actually faster to charge to 50%, drive until empty, charge to 50%, and drive
538280	542820	until empty again, then charging to 100% and driving to empty.
542820	550180	A Tesla Model 3 can go from 0 to 50% charge in 15 minutes on a 250 kilowatt charger and
550180	555160	17 minutes on a 150 kilowatt charger, giving it enough range to drive at least 100 miles
555160	561820	or 160 kilometers, while charging from 50% to 90% would take an additional 27 minutes
561820	563260	in both cases.
563260	569060	So, combining two charges from empty to 50% in two stops, you could effectively reach
569060	576340	the tipping point speed of 100% charge in 31 minutes with existing 250 kilowatt chargers.
576340	583180	Therefore, what the industry needs is not faster chargers, but more chargers, which
583180	588220	is hugely difficult given the enormous cost of fast chargers.
588220	592500	The average American lives four minutes away from a gas station.
592500	599140	Meanwhile, the same average American lives 31 minutes away from their nearest Tesla supercharger.
599140	605180	Currently, there are 976 supercharging stations in the US, each of which have anywhere between
605180	608300	two and 56 individual chargers.
608300	613000	In order to match the four-minute average of gas stations, Tesla would need to build
613000	619420	an additional 31,251 supercharging stations.
619420	626420	At their $250,000 per station cost, that would cost the company some $7.8 billion,
626420	630060	or roughly ten times their total annual profits from 2020.
630060	636700	In addition, only some 750,000 Teslas ever have been sold in the US, meaning, to have
636700	641500	fast charging stations as accessible as gas stations, the company would need to install
641500	647980	a $250,000 supercharging station for every 23 cars it had on the road.
647980	652360	Right obviously, that's not feasible, as the stations would never break even with such
652360	656500	infrequent use, and that's the exact problem.
656500	661160	You need the infrastructure to sell the cars, but you can't build the infrastructure until
661160	662160	you sell the cars.
662160	666140	It is the classic chicken and the egg problem.
666140	669420	There might, however, be a solution.
669420	676040	According to federal government data, there are some 3,845 non-Tesla DC fast chargers
676040	677300	in the US.
677300	681860	The vast majority of which could charge a Model 3 within an hour—assuming it could
681860	683020	connect.
683020	689200	Just as there was a format war in the 1880s between DC and AC power, there is now a war
689200	691060	of charging standards.
691060	696540	Take the example of Salina, Kansas—a small city off of Interstate 70, which most people
696540	700600	only visit to refuel or, in this case, recharge.
700600	705940	This supercharger uses Tesla's proprietary plug, this Electrify America station uses
705940	711940	CCS and CHAdeMO plugs, and this hotel's charger uses a J1772 plug.
711940	715940	There are four different plug types in one small city.
715940	722220	Now, a Tesla could use the Tesla charger and the J1772 charger with an included adapter,
722220	727060	but it could only use the CHAdeMO charger with a speed-limited $540 adapter, and it
727060	731500	couldn't use the CCS charger at all, as there's no adapter for that plug type.
731540	736980	Meanwhile, a Chevy Volt EV wouldn't be able to use the Tesla or CHAdeMO chargers at all
736980	741160	as there are no adapters for either to its CCS plug.
741160	746100	That means that, to accommodate every vehicle type, DC fast chargers need to have three
746100	751660	different plug types, which, overwhelmingly, they just don't.
751660	755260	Especially along interstate highways, there are the Tesla stations, and there are the
755260	758420	combo CHAdeMO and CCS stations.
758460	762140	While vehicles like Edison and Westinghouse delayed more widespread adoption of electric
762140	767380	power by competing against each other in these same areas with their different, incompatible
767380	772100	AC and DC standards, different stakeholders in the electric vehicle market are competing
772100	778100	against each other in the US to create redundant, largely incompatible networks.
778100	780920	But that's not happening everywhere.
780920	784820	You see, in Europe, CCS is the standard.
784820	790060	The European Union has a directive, which means that many member states, by law, require
790060	794820	that public DC fast chargers include a CCS plug.
794820	800300	Therefore, in the EU and neighboring countries like the UK, Norway, and Switzerland, CCS
800300	803980	is now the de facto or de jure charging standard.
803980	809320	That forced Tesla's hand to the point that in 2018, it retrofitted all its existing superchargers
809320	815040	with CCS plugs, switched its Model 3s to CCS, and released an adapter allowing its other
815040	817680	models to use CCS chargers.
817680	823160	All told, this means that pretty much any car in Europe can use pretty much any DC fast
823160	824160	charger.
824160	829160	That, combined with Europe's higher population density, has helped ensure that the density
829160	835920	and coverage of DC fast chargers is much greater than in the US, despite the fact that EV ownership
835920	840640	per capita is actually higher in the US than Europe as a whole, although certain European
840640	843320	countries far eclipse the US's rate.
843320	847640	Europe is almost identical in size to the US—it has a very similar number of electric
847640	853440	cars overall—but it has double the number of DC fast charging stations.
853440	860460	In Germany, the furthest you can seemingly get from a DC fast charger is here, in Winterberg.
860460	865580	From this small ski town, the nearest fast charger is about 30 miles or 50 kilometers
865580	867300	away in Marburg.
867300	873140	Meanwhile, in the US, if you wanted to drive directly from Dallas to Denver, to major American
873140	877060	cities, using a base model Tesla Model 3, you just couldn't.
877060	884820	There's a 226 mile or 363 kilometer stretch with no DC fast charger between Amarillo,
884820	890540	Texas, and Trinidad, Colorado, which, given the elevation gain, the car would not make.
890540	895460	While Tesla is plugging this gap soon with a new charger in Clayton, New Mexico, that
895460	900260	won't solve the problem for every single other EV on the market, since the charging
900260	902780	systems are not compatible.
902780	908400	Simply put, mass-market consumers are not going to buy cars that can't drive from
908400	910460	Dallas to Denver.
910460	915900	What Europe has that the US does not is coordinated government plans.
915900	921000	Germany's federal government, for example, builds its own charging stations, in addition
921000	925180	to offering strong incentives for private companies to do so as well.
925180	929900	Meanwhile, the federal government in the US has done very little to incentivize fast charger
929900	934180	construction, and certainly does not have a network of its own.
934180	939180	Certain states, such as Oklahoma or Colorado, do have strong coordinated government programs
939180	944040	to build fast charging infrastructure, meaning even shorter range EVs can drive essentially
944040	948400	anywhere in each state without encountering a fast charger gap, but the problem is that
948400	953460	EV drivers from Colorado or Oklahoma will eventually want to drive through Kansas, or
953460	958940	Nebraska, or Wyoming, or other states that do not have a coordinated plan.
958940	964800	The US federal government clearly wants people to buy EVs because it offers hefty tax credits
964800	970400	to those who do so, but people are not going to buy EVs without the charging infrastructure
970400	971880	to support it.
971880	977120	EVs are comparable in cost to internal combustion cars, their range is about what consumers
977120	981920	demand, but what's lagging behind is that charging infrastructure.
981920	985360	This isn't even an exclusively American problem.
985360	989640	In Australia, one can't drive from Perth to Sydney, the country's fourth and first
989640	995880	most populous cities, in an EV due to a massive charging gap, while in Russia, despite similar
995880	1003800	incentives for EV purchases, there are a total of 24 DC fast chargers in the entire country.
1003800	1008140	Of course some will always debate whether governments should be incentivizing electric
1008140	1011760	vehicles at all, but regardless of that, they are.
1011760	1017000	It's tough to find a developed country that does not have some tax or other monetary incentive
1017000	1018960	for EV ownership.
1018960	1022240	The point is that they're incentivizing the wrong way.
1022240	1030160	EVs are very, very close to reaching the tipping point criteria for everything but charging.
1030160	1034640	Cost is not standing in the way, technology is not standing in the way, infrastructure
1034640	1038760	is, so governments are putting the cart before the horse.
1038760	1043520	Individual companies cannot reach the required scale, and even if they did, as the format
1043520	1048500	war in the US proves, it probably wouldn't be the kind of scale that the mass-market
1048500	1050720	consumer demands.
1050720	1055120	Individual car companies can deal with making individual electric vehicles attractive to
1055120	1056120	consumers.
1056120	1061640	The government doesn't need to worry about that, but infrastructure—that's the government's
1061640	1062640	job.
1062640	1069640	Governments run or regulate roads, and bridges, and tunnels, and sidewalks, railways, airports,
1069640	1075280	electric grids, dams, sewers, water supply networks, and even fuel supply systems—because
1075280	1082040	they are infrastructure, and infrastructure is essential, so the only question is, why
1082040	1084160	not charging?
1084160	1090180	So, as you might have guessed by now, I own an electric vehicle, so I took it to my local
1090180	1095440	Tesla Supercharger to make a companion video to this where I give a super detailed, super
1095440	1101080	nerdy explanation of exactly how a supercharger works from a technical perspective.
1101080	1106600	You can find that companion video exclusively on Nebula which, as you probably know by now,

1162000	1166280	All told, CuriosityStream is great thanks to their seemingly endless library of top
1166280	1171160	quality stuff, and Nebula is great thanks to its exclusive, early, and ad-free videos
1171160	1174880	from the educational creators you already know and love.
1174880	1179320	CuriosityStream and Nebula together is greater than great, though, because it's only $15
1179320	1184400	a year with the current sale at curiositystream.com slash wendover.
