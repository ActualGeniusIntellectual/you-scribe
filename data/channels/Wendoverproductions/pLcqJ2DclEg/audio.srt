4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,460
With any disruptive technology, there's a tipping point.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,440
There is a point in time when its path towards market dominance is a certainty.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,640
Now, electric vehicles are almost certainly a disruptive technology.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,720
They're almost certainly a technology that will, with time, become dominant over their

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,720
predecessor.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,680
In this case, the predecessor is the internal combustion car that you, yourself, almost

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,400
certainly use.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,320
Chances are, though, when asked, you'd say that your next car will not be electric, and

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,340
you're right—the average consumer, according to surveys, would not even consider purchasing

13
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:56,120
an electric vehicle, demonstrating that the technology is not yet at the tipping point

14
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,800
where it's on a certain path towards market dominance.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,280
But again, that path is almost certain.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,720
EVs are not there yet—right now they're too expensive, too short-range, and too slow

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,240
to charge—but they're close.

18
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,120
In fact, research can quantify just how close they are.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,000
It's been shown that the tipping point price for EVs—the price that will lead to mainstream

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,200
adoption and eventual disruption—is $36,000.

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,680
Taking a look at the prices of the base models of three of the world's best-selling electric

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,200
vehicles, they're already roughly there, so we know that that's not what's holding

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,640
mass-market consumers back.

24
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,760
What also matters is range.

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,280
Consumers say they need 291 miles or 469 kilometers of it before the cars can go mass-market.

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,080
Two of the best-selling EVs—the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevy Volt EV—are not far from

27
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,060
different, while the Nissan Leaf lags behind.

28
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,120
Range and cost are closely linked, and you can essentially trade one off for the other,

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,600
as the battery is the single largest cost of an EV.

30
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,840
That's why the industry is so focused on innovating and scaling to lower the component

31
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,080
cost of EV batteries, and it's working.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,040
In 2013, the average price per kilowatt-hour of an EV battery was $668, meaning the base

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,440
model Tesla Model 3's 50 kilowatt-hour battery would cost $22,400—two-thirds of what the

34
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,960
vehicle sells for.

35
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,940
Nowadays, the average price per kilowatt-hour is all the way down to $137, meaning that

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,680
same battery pack would cost just $6,850, and this price per kilowatt-hour is expected

37
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,320
to lower to $100 by 2023.

38
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,280
It's getting more and more possible for manufacturers to sell an EV for the magic

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,520
$36,000 price with the magic 291-mile range.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,000
While EVs are not quite there yet, they're really not far, and will be there in the next

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
few years.

42
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,760
So, range is not what's significantly holding mass-market consumers back, and it won't

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,540
be at all within a few years.

44
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,080
What is, though, is charging.

45
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,800
The research shows that consumers want to be able to charge their cars from empty to

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,980
full in 31 minutes, and that's the magic number for mass-market adoption.

47
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,900
With this, current $36,000 EVs just aren't yet there.

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,500
The base model Chevy Volt EV can't even fast-charge—it doesn't have the technology

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,800
for it—and even the upgraded, more expensive model that does allow for fast-charging can

50
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,820
only get to 39% state of charge in 31 minutes.

51
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,420
The Nissan Leaf does a little better, attaining 62% state of charge in 31 minutes, while the

52
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,820
base model Tesla Model 3 does the best with its ability to fill its battery to 83% in

53
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,420
the most ideal conditions using the fastest models of Tesla Superchargers, but that would

54
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:00,240
only give it 196 miles or 315 kilometers of range, again in the most ideal conditions.

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,620
In colder weather, both that charging time would be greater, and that range would be

56
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
less.

57
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,060
So, it's currently possible to get an EV with just about what the mass-market requires

58
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:16,880
for cost and range, but reaching that charging time, that's just a lot tougher.

59
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,920
What this research can lead us to conclude is that the largest barrier right now to mass-market

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,900
EV adoption is, in fact, the charging problem.

61
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,100
The tipping point just will not happen without widespread fast-charging, but widespread fast-charging

62
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,860
is just difficult because of the very way our electric grid works.

63
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:44,140
You see, back in the 1880s, Thomas Edison, with his direct current electric system, battled

64
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,440
it out with George Westinghouse and his alternating current system.

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:54,040
As the names suggest, direct current electricity flows consistently and unidirectionally, while

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,580
alternating current oscillates in magnitude and rapidly changes direction.

67
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,420
The exact details of how each works isn't that important in this context, but what is

68
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:08,340
is to know that, for a variety of reasons, AC power won, it's now the standard for

69
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,620
power grids, but there are certain technologies that still need DC power.

70
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,420
The most widespread example of that is batteries—you cannot charge a battery using AC power.

71
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,260
That's why you don't plug your smartphone directly into an outlet—you plug it into

72
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,880
a power brick that plugs into an outlet, and that power brick is an AC to DC converter.

73
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,580
A standard iPhone charging inverter outputs 5 watts of electricity, which is plenty enough

74
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,300
to charge the phone's 11 watt-hour battery in a few hours.

75
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,820
A base-model Tesla Model 3, meanwhile, has a 50 kilowatt-hour battery—4,500 times larger.

76
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,540
Therefore, it needs a much higher wattage power inverter to charge with any speed.

77
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,600
It solves this in two ways.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,860
Onboard that Model 3, there's a 7.7 kilowatt inverter that can take AC power from common

79
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:09,360
sources, like a standard wall outlet, and convert it into DC power to charge the battery.

80
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,280
At its max rate, this can charge the car fully in under 10 hours, and has the advantage of

81
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,840
allowing consumers to charge using regular wall plugs or by installing relatively inexpensive

82
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,520
chargers on existing domestic AC electric circuits.

83
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,480
The disadvantage, though, is that while 7.7 kilowatts is plenty fast enough for regular,

84
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,800
overnight at-home charging, it's not fast enough to compete with the convenience of

85
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,920
filling up an internal combustion car at the gas station.

86
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:40,700
It's not fast enough if you're on a long-distance trip and need to be able to gain hundreds

87
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,760
of miles of range in a matter of minutes.

88
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,560
So, if you need more electricity faster, you need a higher wattage inverter.

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,840
To be able to take a Tesla Model 3 from almost empty to almost full in 30 minutes, you want

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,200
between 120 and 250 kilowatts.

91
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:07,960
The problem, though, is that a 250 kilowatt inverter costs, at least in this case, $57,600,

92
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,160
and is about the size of a very large fridge.

93
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,080
It's not exactly practical to have this as an internal component of the car.

94
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,680
So, for faster charging, one needs to off-board the inversion process.

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,520
That's exactly what a DC fast charger does—it supplies a huge quantity of DC power to the

96
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,560
car, which bypasses the onboard inverter and charges the battery directly.

97
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,800
Between the inverter, the charger, and all the other equipment needed for a fast-charging

98
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,180
the cost and size is not insignificant.

99
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,160
One of the more popular models, the Chargepoint Express 250, which can charge a single car

100
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:55,840
at a somewhat slow 62.5 kilowatts, sells for $40,800, and that's before installation.

101
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,640
Meanwhile, while it's tough to get an exact figure, industry experts estimate it costs

102
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:08,240
Tesla about $250,000 to build an average supercharging station with six to eight stalls delivering

103
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,680
120 to 150 kilowatts each, while its closest equivalent, the stations by Volkswagen's

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,520
Electrify America, are estimated to cost $350,000.

105
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,680
But here's something counterintuitive.

106
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Using a 250 kilowatt charger versus a 150 kilowatt one doesn't really impact how fast

107
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,060
you charge.

108
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:37,760
Batteries charge slower the more full they are, so the first 20% will pass far faster

109
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,000
than the last 20%.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,240
In the context of EV charging, this means that quite quickly into the charge, the speed

111
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,380
is impacted not by how much power the station is putting out, but by how much electricity

112
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,960
the battery can accept.

113
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:58,280
So, it's actually faster to charge to 50%, drive until empty, charge to 50%, and drive

114
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,820
until empty again, then charging to 100% and driving to empty.

115
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:10,180
A Tesla Model 3 can go from 0 to 50% charge in 15 minutes on a 250 kilowatt charger and

116
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,160
17 minutes on a 150 kilowatt charger, giving it enough range to drive at least 100 miles

117
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,820
or 160 kilometers, while charging from 50% to 90% would take an additional 27 minutes

118
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,260
in both cases.

119
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,060
So, combining two charges from empty to 50% in two stops, you could effectively reach

120
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:36,340
the tipping point speed of 100% charge in 31 minutes with existing 250 kilowatt chargers.

121
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:43,180
Therefore, what the industry needs is not faster chargers, but more chargers, which

122
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,220
is hugely difficult given the enormous cost of fast chargers.

123
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,500
The average American lives four minutes away from a gas station.

124
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:59,140
Meanwhile, the same average American lives 31 minutes away from their nearest Tesla supercharger.

125
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,180
Currently, there are 976 supercharging stations in the US, each of which have anywhere between

126
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,300
two and 56 individual chargers.

127
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,000
In order to match the four-minute average of gas stations, Tesla would need to build

128
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,420
an additional 31,251 supercharging stations.

129
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:26,420
At their $250,000 per station cost, that would cost the company some $7.8 billion,

130
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,060
or roughly ten times their total annual profits from 2020.

131
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,700
In addition, only some 750,000 Teslas ever have been sold in the US, meaning, to have

132
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,500
fast charging stations as accessible as gas stations, the company would need to install

133
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,980
a $250,000 supercharging station for every 23 cars it had on the road.

134
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,360
Right obviously, that's not feasible, as the stations would never break even with such

135
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,500
infrequent use, and that's the exact problem.

136
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,160
You need the infrastructure to sell the cars, but you can't build the infrastructure until

137
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
you sell the cars.

138
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,140
It is the classic chicken and the egg problem.

139
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,420
There might, however, be a solution.

140
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:16,040
According to federal government data, there are some 3,845 non-Tesla DC fast chargers

141
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,300
in the US.

142
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,860
The vast majority of which could charge a Model 3 within an hour—assuming it could

143
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,020
connect.

144
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,200
Just as there was a format war in the 1880s between DC and AC power, there is now a war

145
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,060
of charging standards.

146
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,540
Take the example of Salina, Kansas—a small city off of Interstate 70, which most people

147
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,600
only visit to refuel or, in this case, recharge.

148
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,940
This supercharger uses Tesla's proprietary plug, this Electrify America station uses

149
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:51,940
CCS and CHAdeMO plugs, and this hotel's charger uses a J1772 plug.

150
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,940
There are four different plug types in one small city.

151
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:02,220
Now, a Tesla could use the Tesla charger and the J1772 charger with an included adapter,

152
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,060
but it could only use the CHAdeMO charger with a speed-limited $540 adapter, and it

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,500
couldn't use the CCS charger at all, as there's no adapter for that plug type.

154
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,980
Meanwhile, a Chevy Volt EV wouldn't be able to use the Tesla or CHAdeMO chargers at all

155
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,160
as there are no adapters for either to its CCS plug.

156
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,100
That means that, to accommodate every vehicle type, DC fast chargers need to have three

157
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,660
different plug types, which, overwhelmingly, they just don't.

158
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,260
Especially along interstate highways, there are the Tesla stations, and there are the

159
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,420
combo CHAdeMO and CCS stations.

160
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,140
While vehicles like Edison and Westinghouse delayed more widespread adoption of electric

161
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,380
power by competing against each other in these same areas with their different, incompatible

162
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,100
AC and DC standards, different stakeholders in the electric vehicle market are competing

163
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,100
against each other in the US to create redundant, largely incompatible networks.

164
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,920
But that's not happening everywhere.

165
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,820
You see, in Europe, CCS is the standard.

166
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,060
The European Union has a directive, which means that many member states, by law, require

167
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,820
that public DC fast chargers include a CCS plug.

168
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,300
Therefore, in the EU and neighboring countries like the UK, Norway, and Switzerland, CCS

169
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,980
is now the de facto or de jure charging standard.

170
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:29,320
That forced Tesla's hand to the point that in 2018, it retrofitted all its existing superchargers

171
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:35,040
with CCS plugs, switched its Model 3s to CCS, and released an adapter allowing its other

172
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,680
models to use CCS chargers.

173
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,160
All told, this means that pretty much any car in Europe can use pretty much any DC fast

174
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
charger.

175
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,160
That, combined with Europe's higher population density, has helped ensure that the density

176
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,920
and coverage of DC fast chargers is much greater than in the US, despite the fact that EV ownership

177
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,640
per capita is actually higher in the US than Europe as a whole, although certain European

178
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,320
countries far eclipse the US's rate.

179
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,640
Europe is almost identical in size to the US—it has a very similar number of electric

180
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:13,440
cars overall—but it has double the number of DC fast charging stations.

181
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,460
In Germany, the furthest you can seemingly get from a DC fast charger is here, in Winterberg.

182
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,580
From this small ski town, the nearest fast charger is about 30 miles or 50 kilometers

183
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,300
away in Marburg.

184
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:33,140
Meanwhile, in the US, if you wanted to drive directly from Dallas to Denver, to major American

185
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,060
cities, using a base model Tesla Model 3, you just couldn't.

186
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:44,820
There's a 226 mile or 363 kilometer stretch with no DC fast charger between Amarillo,

187
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:50,540
Texas, and Trinidad, Colorado, which, given the elevation gain, the car would not make.

188
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,460
While Tesla is plugging this gap soon with a new charger in Clayton, New Mexico, that

189
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,260
won't solve the problem for every single other EV on the market, since the charging

190
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,780
systems are not compatible.

191
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:08,400
Simply put, mass-market consumers are not going to buy cars that can't drive from

192
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,460
Dallas to Denver.

193
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,900
What Europe has that the US does not is coordinated government plans.

194
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,000
Germany's federal government, for example, builds its own charging stations, in addition

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,180
to offering strong incentives for private companies to do so as well.

196
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,900
Meanwhile, the federal government in the US has done very little to incentivize fast charger

197
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,180
construction, and certainly does not have a network of its own.

198
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Certain states, such as Oklahoma or Colorado, do have strong coordinated government programs

199
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,040
to build fast charging infrastructure, meaning even shorter range EVs can drive essentially

200
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,400
anywhere in each state without encountering a fast charger gap, but the problem is that

201
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:53,460
EV drivers from Colorado or Oklahoma will eventually want to drive through Kansas, or

202
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,940
Nebraska, or Wyoming, or other states that do not have a coordinated plan.

203
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,800
The US federal government clearly wants people to buy EVs because it offers hefty tax credits

204
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:10,400
to those who do so, but people are not going to buy EVs without the charging infrastructure

205
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,880
to support it.

206
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,120
EVs are comparable in cost to internal combustion cars, their range is about what consumers

207
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,920
demand, but what's lagging behind is that charging infrastructure.

208
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,360
This isn't even an exclusively American problem.

209
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,640
In Australia, one can't drive from Perth to Sydney, the country's fourth and first

210
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,880
most populous cities, in an EV due to a massive charging gap, while in Russia, despite similar

211
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:43,800
incentives for EV purchases, there are a total of 24 DC fast chargers in the entire country.

212
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,140
Of course some will always debate whether governments should be incentivizing electric

213
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,760
vehicles at all, but regardless of that, they are.

214
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,000
It's tough to find a developed country that does not have some tax or other monetary incentive

215
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,960
for EV ownership.

216
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,240
The point is that they're incentivizing the wrong way.

217
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,160
EVs are very, very close to reaching the tipping point criteria for everything but charging.

218
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,640
Cost is not standing in the way, technology is not standing in the way, infrastructure

219
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,760
is, so governments are putting the cart before the horse.

220
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,520
Individual companies cannot reach the required scale, and even if they did, as the format

221
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,500
war in the US proves, it probably wouldn't be the kind of scale that the mass-market

222
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,720
consumer demands.

223
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,120
Individual car companies can deal with making individual electric vehicles attractive to

224
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
consumers.

225
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,640
The government doesn't need to worry about that, but infrastructure—that's the government's

226
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
job.

227
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Governments run or regulate roads, and bridges, and tunnels, and sidewalks, railways, airports,

228
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,280
electric grids, dams, sewers, water supply networks, and even fuel supply systems—because

229
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,040
they are infrastructure, and infrastructure is essential, so the only question is, why

230
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,160
not charging?

231
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,180
So, as you might have guessed by now, I own an electric vehicle, so I took it to my local

232
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,440
Tesla Supercharger to make a companion video to this where I give a super detailed, super

233
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,080
nerdy explanation of exactly how a supercharger works from a technical perspective.

234
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,600
You can find that companion video exclusively on Nebula which, as you probably know by now,

235
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,840
is home to tons of exclusive, ad-free content from tons of your favorite educational creators.

236
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:37,880
The reason we can put companion videos like this there is because of the way Nebula works—it

237
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,520
doesn't have an algorithm to punish us when we make something different from our normal

238
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,200
stuff, and the direct subscriptions from users help fund both these and other projects,

239
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,220
like our many Nebula originals.

240
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,520
If you're interested in watching all this exclusive content, plus supporting loads of

241
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,360
independent, educational creators, you can sign up using the CuriosityStream Nebula bundle.

242
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,520
Basically, you go to curiositystream.com slash wendover, sign up for any subscription, but

243
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,720
I suggest the yearly one since it's on sale for less than $15 a year right now, and then

244
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,040
you have access to both streaming sites.

245
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,320
CuriosityStream itself has great stuff too from more established names like Richard Hammond,

246
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,080
of Top Gear and Grand Tour, who made a series about how weather actually works by going

247
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,000
into extreme weather.

248
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,280
All told, CuriosityStream is great thanks to their seemingly endless library of top

249
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,160
quality stuff, and Nebula is great thanks to its exclusive, early, and ad-free videos

250
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,880
from the educational creators you already know and love.

251
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,320
CuriosityStream and Nebula together is greater than great, though, because it's only $15

252
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,400
a year with the current sale at curiositystream.com slash wendover.
