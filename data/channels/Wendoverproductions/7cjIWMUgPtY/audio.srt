3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,480
According to conventional economic rules, casinos shouldn't be able to exist.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,280
That's because conventional economic rules assume humans are rational.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,220
Conventional economic rules would predict that, if someone offered you a deal where

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,820
you gave them $100 and they gave you $94.80 back, you wouldn't take that deal but for

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,860
some strange reason perfectly intelligent people head to the roulette table every day

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,380
and in essence take that exact deal.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,100
Just look, an American roulette table has 38 numbers on it—double zero, zero, and

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,480
1 through 36.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,920
The best odds on the table are in the red, black, even, and odd boxes.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,540
If you put a $5 chip in the red box, for example, and the ball falls on a red number you double

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,280
your money, you gain $5, but of course the ball can fall on zero or double zero which

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,280
are neither red nor black, and, for these purposes, neither even nor odd.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,440
Now, if the zero and double zero didn't exist then playing roulette would make perfect

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
sense.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,380
If you came in with $100 and played infinite times you would leave with $100 because it

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,740
would be a 50% chance of doubling your money each time.

19
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,760
In reality, because of those zeros, the odds of doubling your money are actually 47.4%.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,800
That means that for every dollar you play you can expect to lose 5.2 cents but for some

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,040
reason people still do it while this small gap in between fair odds and the odds casinos

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,980
and other gambling institutions offer earn them worldwide close to half a trillion dollars

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,260
per year.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,760
But consider this, for the same reason gambling shouldn't work, insurance also shouldn't.

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,920
Insurance is essentially the exact opposite of gambling.

26
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,800
Insurance companies are basically gambling companies but the roles are flipped—the

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,640
insurance companies are the gamblers and you're the casino.

28
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
If you pay a car insurance company, for example, $1,500 a year to insure your vehicle, they're

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,840
gambling that you're not going to cause more than $1,500 in coverable damage in any

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,600
one year but of course it takes money to run the insurance company so they need a margin.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,640
MetLife, one of the world's largest insurance companies, for example, takes in $37.2 billion

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,840
from the people who hold insurance policies with them but then pay back in insurance claims

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,260
just $36.35 billion.

34
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,380
Of course there are other sources of revenue and other expenses at MetLife but just looking

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:23,500
at the balance between what comes in and what goes out for insurance, the odds are pretty

36
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,520
decent compared to the roulette wheel.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,460
For every dollar you give them you can expect to get about 97.7 cents back but that's

38
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,980
still losing money.

39
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,460
According to the same conventional economic rules that say that casinos shouldn't be

40
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,640
able to exist, insurance companies too just shouldn't work as a concept because people

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,660
get back less than they put in but here's why they do.

42
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:49,100
Just consider this, would you rather, with 100% certainty, receive $5 or would you rather

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,700
have an 80% chance of receiving $6.25?

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,260
Feel free to think about it for a second but chances are that you said that you'd rather

45
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,920
have that sure $5.

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,780
When surveyed with this question over three quarters of respondents said that they wanted

47
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,220
the certain $5 over the 80% chance of $6.25 but here's the strange thing.

48
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,780
These two options are worth the exact same amount.

49
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,840
If you took the 80% gamble infinite times you would receive an average of $5 each time

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,160
as 80% of $6.25 is $5.

51
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,640
Therefore, in theory, people should have no preference between these two options because

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,520
they're worth the exact same amount.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,200
But here's the thing, people, in general, dislike losing a given amount of money more

54
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,160
than they like winning it.

55
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,800
That is, the negative effect of losing $5, for example, is greater than the positive

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,440
effect of winning $5.

57
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,380
As the second option comes with the chance of loss, which is a negative experience more

58
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,920
powerful than the positive experience of certainly gaining $5, this option is worth less overall

59
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,640
even if it's worth the same in a dollar amount.

60
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,060
This is why insurance works.

61
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,320
Insurance is a worthwhile gamble for the insurance company since the odds are in their favor

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,160
and they make money while the gamble is worth it for you because the monetary amount you

63
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,320
get back plus the absence of monetary loss make the deal worth more than the money you

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,880
put in overall.

65
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,920
Of course it is a bit more complicated than this since insurance companies often have

66
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,120
preferential rates for healthcare and it helps smooth out economic shocks so, despite being

67
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,480
a gamble, it is absolutely worth it in most cases but insurance, at its most basic level,

68
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,180
is losing to avoid loss.

69
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,160
The principle of hating losing can be used to make the same amount of money worth more.

70
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,320
In one experiment, 150 teachers in Chicago Heights were split up into three groups.

71
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,680
One group received nothing, one was told that they would receive a bonus at the end of the

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
year corresponding to how well the students' test scores were, and the third group was

73
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,320
given the exact same deal for a bonus with the only difference being that they were given

74
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,960
the bonus payment upfront at the beginning of the year and told that they would have

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,460
to pay back the corresponding amount if their students did not score the test scores necessary.

76
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,220
The group that was promised the bonus if test scores improved performed largely the same

77
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,880
as the group offered no bonus but, the group given the bonus upfront overall performed

78
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,800
much better with test scores improving up to three times as much as the traditional

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
bonus group.

80
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,440
It's clear that the fear of loss is far more powerful than the promise of gain so

81
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,800
this explains why insurance works but, for the same reason, gambling still shouldn't

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,960
work but something interesting starts changing when you change the odds.

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,860
Now remember that three quarters of people preferred a sure $5 to an 80% chance of $6.25

84
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,120
but now think whether you'd prefer a 100% chance of receiving $5 or a 25% chance of

85
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,800
winning $20.

86
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,280
Once again, the options are worth the exact same amount since 25% of $20 is $5 but, with

87
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,800
this change of odds, those surveyed on average had no preference between the two options.

88
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,920
Half preferred the sure $5 and the other half preferred a 25% chance of $20.

89
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,320
But let's change the odds again.

90
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:04,560
Would you prefer a 100% chance of receiving $5 or a .5% chance of winning $1,000?

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,660
Still with these numbers, .5% of $1,000 is $5 so the two options are worth the exact

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,120
same amount but, with these options, for the first time people prefer the gamble.

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,700
Only 36% of respondents said that they would take the $5 while 64% preferred the half percent

94
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,520
chance of winning $1,000.

95
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:28,060
What we've begun to understand is that humans like low probability risk.

96
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,920
We like a small chance of winning big over a certain gain.

97
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,300
In fact, you can see this at the race track.

98
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,640
The best horse might have 2 to 1 odds where you get $3 if they win for each dollar you

99
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:43,500
bet while the bottom horse might have 200 to 1 odds where you get $300 if they win for

100
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,540
each dollar you bet but, as it turns out, on average, the chance of the top horse winning

101
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:52,600
is actually better than 2 to 1 and the chance of the bottom horse winning is worse than

102
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,600
200 to 1 because people prefer betting on the underdog which inflates the odds.

103
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,640
You could therefore make more money betting on the horse that's likeliest to win.

104
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,300
Crunching the betting data from 8,000 tennis matches, it was found that the bets on the

105
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,860
best athletes with the best odds actually made money on average with 103% of the money

106
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,160
won back while the bets on the worst athletes with the worst odds won just 81% of the money

107
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
back.

108
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,860
Evidence for this phenomenon has been found time and time again but the question of why

109
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,580
we do it is tougher.

110
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,940
The simple answer for why this is is that people overweight the impact and chances of

111
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,600
extremely low probability events.

112
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,720
This has been used to explain why people are so afraid of terrorism and plane crashes

113
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,820
despite the chances of dying of either being monumentally small.

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,680
It really doesn't matter if you know that the odds are not in your favor like with the

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,800
lottery or in the casino.

116
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,440
People still love risk if it comes with large returns and this is why gambling works as

117
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,640
a concept.

118
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,480
Everyone just has some arbitrary point where, given two options with the same value, they'll

119
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,900
start accepting the risk over the sure money.

120
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,960
What that means is that in a gambling transaction, with someone who bets and someone who accepts

121
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,700
the bet, both parties actually find what they're doing worthwhile.

122
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,380
The casino finds what they're doing worthwhile because they make money while the bettor finds

123
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:11,500
what they're doing worthwhile because they have the possibility of winning lots of money.

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,640
Now, the explanation for why people prefer these low probability bets moves further away

125
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,460
from economics into psychology but one explanation with the lottery, for example, is that a bet

126
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,900
doubling one's money does little to change one's quality of life but, a bet multiplying

127
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,200
a person's money by a factor of thousands can be truly life-changing so people are betting

128
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,080
for monumental change rather than for another cup of coffee.

129
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,520
To summarize, what this all means is that a 5% chance of $100 is worth more to people

130
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,060
than $5 despite both having a monetary value of $5.

131
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:48,100
Therefore, by offering gambles, people can make money more powerful.

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,860
Almost everywhere in the world there is an issue of low savings rates—people don't

133
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,780
put enough money into banks.

134
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,420
About half of Americans could not immediately come up with $2,000 if an unexpected expense

135
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,420
came up according to one survey.

136
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,560
A big reason for this lack of savings is that banks are not incentivizing enough.

137
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,660
With how tiny savings accounts interest rates are, many people just don't see a reason

138
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,340
to put their money in banks and banks are unwilling or financially can't increase

139
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,080
their interest rates so how do you make the same amount of money go further?

140
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,460
You turn it into a gamble.

141
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,420
Economists created a concept for what's called a prize-linked savings account.

142
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,860
A normal savings account with $2,000 in it at a bank that offered 1% annual interest

143
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,020
would earn $20 a year but, with a prize-linked savings account, instead of being given the

144
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:38,220
$20 in interest it would be entered into a gamble with, for example, a .4% chance of

145
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,080
winning $5,000.

146
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,500
As always, that gamble is still worth $20 monetarily but to the gambler it's worth

147
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,540
more.

148
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,380
These prize-linked savings accounts have been incredibly successful at getting people to

149
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
save.

150
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,660
In Reagan's trial of the system, 56% of those using it were first-time savers.

151
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,420
These same principles are the ones that make lotteries work.

152
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,260
In fact, lotteries are just such easy ways of making money that in many countries, privately

153
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,140
run lotteries are illegal.

154
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,920
In the US, for example, all lotteries have to be state-run and their profits usually

155
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,820
go to funding education.

156
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,180
Because the states are guaranteed to make money from the lottery, it is essentially

157
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,880
a form of taxation.

158
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,620
In fact, all forms of gambling are set up in a way that they're guaranteed to make

159
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,440
money for whoever's running them.

160
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,260
In a casino, at a race track, or with any form of gambling it's never a good deal

161
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,020
for the better but, the reason why people engage in these deals is a fascinating study

162
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:36,760
of behavioral economics and its principles, if applied correctly, can sometimes, just

163
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,660
maybe, be used for good.

164
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,140
What's also a good deal, though, is Squarespace.

165
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,580
That's because if you're running any sort of business your first impression counts immensely

166
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,660
and Squarespace helps you build the perfect first impression.

167
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,580
No matter how small your business is it's absolutely crucial to have a website but of

168
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,060
course it's expensive to hire someone to create one and complicate it to code one yourself.

169
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,720
Squarespace makes it all easy with customizable designer templates, an easy to use website

170
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,960
builder, 24-7 award-winning customer support, and reasonable prices.

171
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,940
The websites can have plenty of features like a blog, video pages, an online store, and

172
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,940
more.

173
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:15,020
