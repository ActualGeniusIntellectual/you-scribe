8720	13480	According to conventional economic rules, casinos shouldn't be able to exist.
13480	18280	That's because conventional economic rules assume humans are rational.
18280	21220	Conventional economic rules would predict that, if someone offered you a deal where
21220	26820	you gave them $100 and they gave you $94.80 back, you wouldn't take that deal but for
26820	31860	some strange reason perfectly intelligent people head to the roulette table every day
31860	35380	and in essence take that exact deal.
35380	40100	Just look, an American roulette table has 38 numbers on it—double zero, zero, and
40100	41480	1 through 36.
41480	45920	The best odds on the table are in the red, black, even, and odd boxes.
45920	50540	If you put a $5 chip in the red box, for example, and the ball falls on a red number you double
50540	55280	your money, you gain $5, but of course the ball can fall on zero or double zero which
55280	59280	are neither red nor black, and, for these purposes, neither even nor odd.
59280	63440	Now, if the zero and double zero didn't exist then playing roulette would make perfect
63440	64440	sense.
64440	68380	If you came in with $100 and played infinite times you would leave with $100 because it
68380	71740	would be a 50% chance of doubling your money each time.
71740	77760	In reality, because of those zeros, the odds of doubling your money are actually 47.4%.
77760	82800	That means that for every dollar you play you can expect to lose 5.2 cents but for some
82800	88040	reason people still do it while this small gap in between fair odds and the odds casinos
88040	92980	and other gambling institutions offer earn them worldwide close to half a trillion dollars
92980	94260	per year.
94260	99760	But consider this, for the same reason gambling shouldn't work, insurance also shouldn't.
99760	102920	Insurance is essentially the exact opposite of gambling.
102920	106800	Insurance companies are basically gambling companies but the roles are flipped—the
106800	109640	insurance companies are the gamblers and you're the casino.
109640	114640	If you pay a car insurance company, for example, $1,500 a year to insure your vehicle, they're
114640	118840	gambling that you're not going to cause more than $1,500 in coverable damage in any
118840	123600	one year but of course it takes money to run the insurance company so they need a margin.
123600	128640	MetLife, one of the world's largest insurance companies, for example, takes in $37.2 billion
128640	132840	from the people who hold insurance policies with them but then pay back in insurance claims
132840	135260	just $36.35 billion.
135260	139380	Of course there are other sources of revenue and other expenses at MetLife but just looking
139380	143500	at the balance between what comes in and what goes out for insurance, the odds are pretty
143500	145520	decent compared to the roulette wheel.
145520	150460	For every dollar you give them you can expect to get about 97.7 cents back but that's
150460	151980	still losing money.
151980	155460	According to the same conventional economic rules that say that casinos shouldn't be
155460	159640	able to exist, insurance companies too just shouldn't work as a concept because people
159640	163660	get back less than they put in but here's why they do.
163660	169100	Just consider this, would you rather, with 100% certainty, receive $5 or would you rather
169100	173700	have an 80% chance of receiving $6.25?
173700	177260	Feel free to think about it for a second but chances are that you said that you'd rather
177260	179920	have that sure $5.
179920	183780	When surveyed with this question over three quarters of respondents said that they wanted
183780	190220	the certain $5 over the 80% chance of $6.25 but here's the strange thing.
190220	193780	These two options are worth the exact same amount.
193780	198840	If you took the 80% gamble infinite times you would receive an average of $5 each time
198840	202160	as 80% of $6.25 is $5.
202160	206640	Therefore, in theory, people should have no preference between these two options because
206640	209520	they're worth the exact same amount.
209520	215200	But here's the thing, people, in general, dislike losing a given amount of money more
215200	217160	than they like winning it.
217160	222800	That is, the negative effect of losing $5, for example, is greater than the positive
222800	225440	effect of winning $5.
225440	229380	As the second option comes with the chance of loss, which is a negative experience more
229380	234920	powerful than the positive experience of certainly gaining $5, this option is worth less overall
234920	237640	even if it's worth the same in a dollar amount.
237640	240060	This is why insurance works.
240060	243320	Insurance is a worthwhile gamble for the insurance company since the odds are in their favor
243320	247160	and they make money while the gamble is worth it for you because the monetary amount you
247160	251320	get back plus the absence of monetary loss make the deal worth more than the money you
251320	252880	put in overall.
252880	255920	Of course it is a bit more complicated than this since insurance companies often have
255920	260120	preferential rates for healthcare and it helps smooth out economic shocks so, despite being
260120	265480	a gamble, it is absolutely worth it in most cases but insurance, at its most basic level,
265480	268180	is losing to avoid loss.
268180	273160	The principle of hating losing can be used to make the same amount of money worth more.
273160	278320	In one experiment, 150 teachers in Chicago Heights were split up into three groups.
278320	281680	One group received nothing, one was told that they would receive a bonus at the end of the
281680	285280	year corresponding to how well the students' test scores were, and the third group was
285280	289320	given the exact same deal for a bonus with the only difference being that they were given
289320	292960	the bonus payment upfront at the beginning of the year and told that they would have
292960	297460	to pay back the corresponding amount if their students did not score the test scores necessary.
297460	301220	The group that was promised the bonus if test scores improved performed largely the same
301220	305880	as the group offered no bonus but, the group given the bonus upfront overall performed
305880	309800	much better with test scores improving up to three times as much as the traditional
309800	310800	bonus group.
310920	315440	It's clear that the fear of loss is far more powerful than the promise of gain so
315440	320800	this explains why insurance works but, for the same reason, gambling still shouldn't
320800	324960	work but something interesting starts changing when you change the odds.
324960	330860	Now remember that three quarters of people preferred a sure $5 to an 80% chance of $6.25
330860	336120	but now think whether you'd prefer a 100% chance of receiving $5 or a 25% chance of
336120	337800	winning $20.
337800	344280	Once again, the options are worth the exact same amount since 25% of $20 is $5 but, with
344280	349800	this change of odds, those surveyed on average had no preference between the two options.
349800	354920	Half preferred the sure $5 and the other half preferred a 25% chance of $20.
354920	357320	But let's change the odds again.
357320	364560	Would you prefer a 100% chance of receiving $5 or a .5% chance of winning $1,000?
364560	369660	Still with these numbers, .5% of $1,000 is $5 so the two options are worth the exact
369660	375120	same amount but, with these options, for the first time people prefer the gamble.
375120	380700	Only 36% of respondents said that they would take the $5 while 64% preferred the half percent
380700	382520	chance of winning $1,000.
382520	388060	What we've begun to understand is that humans like low probability risk.
388060	391920	We like a small chance of winning big over a certain gain.
391920	394300	In fact, you can see this at the race track.
394300	398640	The best horse might have 2 to 1 odds where you get $3 if they win for each dollar you
398640	403500	bet while the bottom horse might have 200 to 1 odds where you get $300 if they win for
403500	408540	each dollar you bet but, as it turns out, on average, the chance of the top horse winning
408540	412600	is actually better than 2 to 1 and the chance of the bottom horse winning is worse than
412600	417600	200 to 1 because people prefer betting on the underdog which inflates the odds.
417600	421640	You could therefore make more money betting on the horse that's likeliest to win.
421640	425300	Crunching the betting data from 8,000 tennis matches, it was found that the bets on the
425300	430860	best athletes with the best odds actually made money on average with 103% of the money
430860	436160	won back while the bets on the worst athletes with the worst odds won just 81% of the money
436160	437160	back.
437160	440860	Evidence for this phenomenon has been found time and time again but the question of why
440860	442580	we do it is tougher.
442580	446940	The simple answer for why this is is that people overweight the impact and chances of
446940	449600	extremely low probability events.
449600	453720	This has been used to explain why people are so afraid of terrorism and plane crashes
453720	456820	despite the chances of dying of either being monumentally small.
456820	460680	It really doesn't matter if you know that the odds are not in your favor like with the
460680	462800	lottery or in the casino.
462800	467440	People still love risk if it comes with large returns and this is why gambling works as
467440	468640	a concept.
468640	473480	Everyone just has some arbitrary point where, given two options with the same value, they'll
473480	475900	start accepting the risk over the sure money.
475900	479960	What that means is that in a gambling transaction, with someone who bets and someone who accepts
479960	483700	the bet, both parties actually find what they're doing worthwhile.
483700	487380	The casino finds what they're doing worthwhile because they make money while the bettor finds
487380	491500	what they're doing worthwhile because they have the possibility of winning lots of money.
491500	495640	Now, the explanation for why people prefer these low probability bets moves further away
495640	500460	from economics into psychology but one explanation with the lottery, for example, is that a bet
500460	504900	doubling one's money does little to change one's quality of life but, a bet multiplying
504900	509200	a person's money by a factor of thousands can be truly life-changing so people are betting
509200	513080	for monumental change rather than for another cup of coffee.
513080	518520	To summarize, what this all means is that a 5% chance of $100 is worth more to people
518520	523060	than $5 despite both having a monetary value of $5.
523060	528100	Therefore, by offering gambles, people can make money more powerful.
528100	531860	Almost everywhere in the world there is an issue of low savings rates—people don't
531860	533780	put enough money into banks.
533780	538420	About half of Americans could not immediately come up with $2,000 if an unexpected expense
538420	540420	came up according to one survey.
540420	545560	A big reason for this lack of savings is that banks are not incentivizing enough.
545560	549660	With how tiny savings accounts interest rates are, many people just don't see a reason
549660	553340	to put their money in banks and banks are unwilling or financially can't increase
553340	557080	their interest rates so how do you make the same amount of money go further?
557080	559460	You turn it into a gamble.
559460	563420	Economists created a concept for what's called a prize-linked savings account.
563420	567860	A normal savings account with $2,000 in it at a bank that offered 1% annual interest
567860	573020	would earn $20 a year but, with a prize-linked savings account, instead of being given the
573020	578220	$20 in interest it would be entered into a gamble with, for example, a .4% chance of
578220	580080	winning $5,000.
580080	585500	As always, that gamble is still worth $20 monetarily but to the gambler it's worth
585500	586540	more.
586540	590380	These prize-linked savings accounts have been incredibly successful at getting people to
590380	591380	save.
591380	596660	In Reagan's trial of the system, 56% of those using it were first-time savers.
596660	599420	These same principles are the ones that make lotteries work.
599420	604260	In fact, lotteries are just such easy ways of making money that in many countries, privately
604260	606140	run lotteries are illegal.
606140	609920	In the US, for example, all lotteries have to be state-run and their profits usually
609920	611820	go to funding education.
611820	615180	Because the states are guaranteed to make money from the lottery, it is essentially
615180	616880	a form of taxation.
616880	620620	In fact, all forms of gambling are set up in a way that they're guaranteed to make
620620	622440	money for whoever's running them.
622440	627260	In a casino, at a race track, or with any form of gambling it's never a good deal
627260	632020	for the better but, the reason why people engage in these deals is a fascinating study
632020	636760	of behavioral economics and its principles, if applied correctly, can sometimes, just
636760	638660	maybe, be used for good.
638660	641140	What's also a good deal, though, is Squarespace.
641140	645580	That's because if you're running any sort of business your first impression counts immensely
645580	648660	and Squarespace helps you build the perfect first impression.
648660	652580	No matter how small your business is it's absolutely crucial to have a website but of
652580	657060	course it's expensive to hire someone to create one and complicate it to code one yourself.
657060	660720	Squarespace makes it all easy with customizable designer templates, an easy to use website
660720	664960	builder, 24-7 award-winning customer support, and reasonable prices.
