00:08.720 --> 00:13.480
According to conventional economic rules, casinos shouldn't be able to exist.

00:13.480 --> 00:18.280
That's because conventional economic rules assume humans are rational.

00:18.280 --> 00:21.220
Conventional economic rules would predict that, if someone offered you a deal where

00:21.220 --> 00:26.820
you gave them $100 and they gave you $94.80 back, you wouldn't take that deal but for

00:26.820 --> 00:31.860
some strange reason perfectly intelligent people head to the roulette table every day

00:31.860 --> 00:35.380
and in essence take that exact deal.

00:35.380 --> 00:40.100
Just look, an American roulette table has 38 numbers on it—double zero, zero, and

00:40.100 --> 00:41.480
1 through 36.

00:41.480 --> 00:45.920
The best odds on the table are in the red, black, even, and odd boxes.

00:45.920 --> 00:50.540
If you put a $5 chip in the red box, for example, and the ball falls on a red number you double

00:50.540 --> 00:55.280
your money, you gain $5, but of course the ball can fall on zero or double zero which

00:55.280 --> 00:59.280
are neither red nor black, and, for these purposes, neither even nor odd.

00:59.280 --> 01:03.440
Now, if the zero and double zero didn't exist then playing roulette would make perfect

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
sense.

01:04.440 --> 01:08.380
If you came in with $100 and played infinite times you would leave with $100 because it

01:08.380 --> 01:11.740
would be a 50% chance of doubling your money each time.

01:11.740 --> 01:17.760
In reality, because of those zeros, the odds of doubling your money are actually 47.4%.

01:17.760 --> 01:22.800
That means that for every dollar you play you can expect to lose 5.2 cents but for some

01:22.800 --> 01:28.040
reason people still do it while this small gap in between fair odds and the odds casinos

01:28.040 --> 01:32.980
and other gambling institutions offer earn them worldwide close to half a trillion dollars

01:32.980 --> 01:34.260
per year.

01:34.260 --> 01:39.760
But consider this, for the same reason gambling shouldn't work, insurance also shouldn't.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.920
Insurance is essentially the exact opposite of gambling.

01:42.920 --> 01:46.800
Insurance companies are basically gambling companies but the roles are flipped—the

01:46.800 --> 01:49.640
insurance companies are the gamblers and you're the casino.

01:49.640 --> 01:54.640
If you pay a car insurance company, for example, $1,500 a year to insure your vehicle, they're

01:54.640 --> 01:58.840
gambling that you're not going to cause more than $1,500 in coverable damage in any

01:58.840 --> 02:03.600
one year but of course it takes money to run the insurance company so they need a margin.

02:03.600 --> 02:08.640
MetLife, one of the world's largest insurance companies, for example, takes in $37.2 billion

02:08.640 --> 02:12.840
from the people who hold insurance policies with them but then pay back in insurance claims

02:12.840 --> 02:15.260
just $36.35 billion.

02:15.260 --> 02:19.380
Of course there are other sources of revenue and other expenses at MetLife but just looking

02:19.380 --> 02:23.500
at the balance between what comes in and what goes out for insurance, the odds are pretty

02:23.500 --> 02:25.520
decent compared to the roulette wheel.

02:25.520 --> 02:30.460
For every dollar you give them you can expect to get about 97.7 cents back but that's

02:30.460 --> 02:31.980
still losing money.

02:31.980 --> 02:35.460
According to the same conventional economic rules that say that casinos shouldn't be

02:35.460 --> 02:39.640
able to exist, insurance companies too just shouldn't work as a concept because people

02:39.640 --> 02:43.660
get back less than they put in but here's why they do.

02:43.660 --> 02:49.100
Just consider this, would you rather, with 100% certainty, receive $5 or would you rather

02:49.100 --> 02:53.700
have an 80% chance of receiving $6.25?

02:53.700 --> 02:57.260
Feel free to think about it for a second but chances are that you said that you'd rather

02:57.260 --> 02:59.920
have that sure $5.

02:59.920 --> 03:03.780
When surveyed with this question over three quarters of respondents said that they wanted

03:03.780 --> 03:10.220
the certain $5 over the 80% chance of $6.25 but here's the strange thing.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.780
These two options are worth the exact same amount.

03:13.780 --> 03:18.840
If you took the 80% gamble infinite times you would receive an average of $5 each time

03:18.840 --> 03:22.160
as 80% of $6.25 is $5.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.640
Therefore, in theory, people should have no preference between these two options because

03:26.640 --> 03:29.520
they're worth the exact same amount.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.200
But here's the thing, people, in general, dislike losing a given amount of money more

03:35.200 --> 03:37.160
than they like winning it.

03:37.160 --> 03:42.800
That is, the negative effect of losing $5, for example, is greater than the positive

03:42.800 --> 03:45.440
effect of winning $5.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.380
As the second option comes with the chance of loss, which is a negative experience more

03:49.380 --> 03:54.920
powerful than the positive experience of certainly gaining $5, this option is worth less overall

03:54.920 --> 03:57.640
even if it's worth the same in a dollar amount.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.060
This is why insurance works.

04:00.060 --> 04:03.320
Insurance is a worthwhile gamble for the insurance company since the odds are in their favor

04:03.320 --> 04:07.160
and they make money while the gamble is worth it for you because the monetary amount you

04:07.160 --> 04:11.320
get back plus the absence of monetary loss make the deal worth more than the money you

04:11.320 --> 04:12.880
put in overall.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.920
Of course it is a bit more complicated than this since insurance companies often have

04:15.920 --> 04:20.120
preferential rates for healthcare and it helps smooth out economic shocks so, despite being

04:20.120 --> 04:25.480
a gamble, it is absolutely worth it in most cases but insurance, at its most basic level,

04:25.480 --> 04:28.180
is losing to avoid loss.

04:28.180 --> 04:33.160
The principle of hating losing can be used to make the same amount of money worth more.

04:33.160 --> 04:38.320
In one experiment, 150 teachers in Chicago Heights were split up into three groups.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.680
One group received nothing, one was told that they would receive a bonus at the end of the

04:41.680 --> 04:45.280
year corresponding to how well the students' test scores were, and the third group was

04:45.280 --> 04:49.320
given the exact same deal for a bonus with the only difference being that they were given

04:49.320 --> 04:52.960
the bonus payment upfront at the beginning of the year and told that they would have

04:52.960 --> 04:57.460
to pay back the corresponding amount if their students did not score the test scores necessary.

04:57.460 --> 05:01.220
The group that was promised the bonus if test scores improved performed largely the same

05:01.220 --> 05:05.880
as the group offered no bonus but, the group given the bonus upfront overall performed

05:05.880 --> 05:09.800
much better with test scores improving up to three times as much as the traditional

05:09.800 --> 05:10.800
bonus group.

05:10.920 --> 05:15.440
It's clear that the fear of loss is far more powerful than the promise of gain so

05:15.440 --> 05:20.800
this explains why insurance works but, for the same reason, gambling still shouldn't

05:20.800 --> 05:24.960
work but something interesting starts changing when you change the odds.

05:24.960 --> 05:30.860
Now remember that three quarters of people preferred a sure $5 to an 80% chance of $6.25

05:30.860 --> 05:36.120
but now think whether you'd prefer a 100% chance of receiving $5 or a 25% chance of

05:36.120 --> 05:37.800
winning $20.

05:37.800 --> 05:44.280
Once again, the options are worth the exact same amount since 25% of $20 is $5 but, with

05:44.280 --> 05:49.800
this change of odds, those surveyed on average had no preference between the two options.

05:49.800 --> 05:54.920
Half preferred the sure $5 and the other half preferred a 25% chance of $20.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.320
But let's change the odds again.

05:57.320 --> 06:04.560
Would you prefer a 100% chance of receiving $5 or a .5% chance of winning $1,000?

06:04.560 --> 06:09.660
Still with these numbers, .5% of $1,000 is $5 so the two options are worth the exact

06:09.660 --> 06:15.120
same amount but, with these options, for the first time people prefer the gamble.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.700
Only 36% of respondents said that they would take the $5 while 64% preferred the half percent

06:20.700 --> 06:22.520
chance of winning $1,000.

06:22.520 --> 06:28.060
What we've begun to understand is that humans like low probability risk.

06:28.060 --> 06:31.920
We like a small chance of winning big over a certain gain.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.300
In fact, you can see this at the race track.

06:34.300 --> 06:38.640
The best horse might have 2 to 1 odds where you get $3 if they win for each dollar you

06:38.640 --> 06:43.500
bet while the bottom horse might have 200 to 1 odds where you get $300 if they win for

06:43.500 --> 06:48.540
each dollar you bet but, as it turns out, on average, the chance of the top horse winning

06:48.540 --> 06:52.600
is actually better than 2 to 1 and the chance of the bottom horse winning is worse than

06:52.600 --> 06:57.600
200 to 1 because people prefer betting on the underdog which inflates the odds.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.640
You could therefore make more money betting on the horse that's likeliest to win.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.300
Crunching the betting data from 8,000 tennis matches, it was found that the bets on the

07:05.300 --> 07:10.860
best athletes with the best odds actually made money on average with 103% of the money

07:10.860 --> 07:16.160
won back while the bets on the worst athletes with the worst odds won just 81% of the money

07:16.160 --> 07:17.160
back.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.860
Evidence for this phenomenon has been found time and time again but the question of why

07:20.860 --> 07:22.580
we do it is tougher.

07:22.580 --> 07:26.940
The simple answer for why this is is that people overweight the impact and chances of

07:26.940 --> 07:29.600
extremely low probability events.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.720
This has been used to explain why people are so afraid of terrorism and plane crashes

07:33.720 --> 07:36.820
despite the chances of dying of either being monumentally small.

07:36.820 --> 07:40.680
It really doesn't matter if you know that the odds are not in your favor like with the

07:40.680 --> 07:42.800
lottery or in the casino.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.440
People still love risk if it comes with large returns and this is why gambling works as

07:47.440 --> 07:48.640
a concept.

07:48.640 --> 07:53.480
Everyone just has some arbitrary point where, given two options with the same value, they'll

07:53.480 --> 07:55.900
start accepting the risk over the sure money.

07:55.900 --> 07:59.960
What that means is that in a gambling transaction, with someone who bets and someone who accepts

07:59.960 --> 08:03.700
the bet, both parties actually find what they're doing worthwhile.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.380
The casino finds what they're doing worthwhile because they make money while the bettor finds

08:07.380 --> 08:11.500
what they're doing worthwhile because they have the possibility of winning lots of money.

08:11.500 --> 08:15.640
Now, the explanation for why people prefer these low probability bets moves further away

08:15.640 --> 08:20.460
from economics into psychology but one explanation with the lottery, for example, is that a bet

08:20.460 --> 08:24.900
doubling one's money does little to change one's quality of life but, a bet multiplying

08:24.900 --> 08:29.200
a person's money by a factor of thousands can be truly life-changing so people are betting

08:29.200 --> 08:33.080
for monumental change rather than for another cup of coffee.

08:33.080 --> 08:38.520
To summarize, what this all means is that a 5% chance of $100 is worth more to people

08:38.520 --> 08:43.060
than $5 despite both having a monetary value of $5.

08:43.060 --> 08:48.100
Therefore, by offering gambles, people can make money more powerful.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.860
Almost everywhere in the world there is an issue of low savings rates—people don't

08:51.860 --> 08:53.780
put enough money into banks.

08:53.780 --> 08:58.420
About half of Americans could not immediately come up with $2,000 if an unexpected expense

08:58.420 --> 09:00.420
came up according to one survey.

09:00.420 --> 09:05.560
A big reason for this lack of savings is that banks are not incentivizing enough.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.660
With how tiny savings accounts interest rates are, many people just don't see a reason

09:09.660 --> 09:13.340
to put their money in banks and banks are unwilling or financially can't increase

09:13.340 --> 09:17.080
their interest rates so how do you make the same amount of money go further?

09:17.080 --> 09:19.460
You turn it into a gamble.

09:19.460 --> 09:23.420
Economists created a concept for what's called a prize-linked savings account.

09:23.420 --> 09:27.860
A normal savings account with $2,000 in it at a bank that offered 1% annual interest

09:27.860 --> 09:33.020
would earn $20 a year but, with a prize-linked savings account, instead of being given the

09:33.020 --> 09:38.220
$20 in interest it would be entered into a gamble with, for example, a .4% chance of

09:38.220 --> 09:40.080
winning $5,000.

09:40.080 --> 09:45.500
As always, that gamble is still worth $20 monetarily but to the gambler it's worth

09:45.500 --> 09:46.540
more.

09:46.540 --> 09:50.380
These prize-linked savings accounts have been incredibly successful at getting people to

09:50.380 --> 09:51.380
save.

09:51.380 --> 09:56.660
In Reagan's trial of the system, 56% of those using it were first-time savers.

09:56.660 --> 09:59.420
These same principles are the ones that make lotteries work.

09:59.420 --> 10:04.260
In fact, lotteries are just such easy ways of making money that in many countries, privately

10:04.260 --> 10:06.140
run lotteries are illegal.

10:06.140 --> 10:09.920
In the US, for example, all lotteries have to be state-run and their profits usually

10:09.920 --> 10:11.820
go to funding education.

10:11.820 --> 10:15.180
Because the states are guaranteed to make money from the lottery, it is essentially

10:15.180 --> 10:16.880
a form of taxation.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.620
In fact, all forms of gambling are set up in a way that they're guaranteed to make

10:20.620 --> 10:22.440
money for whoever's running them.

10:22.440 --> 10:27.260
In a casino, at a race track, or with any form of gambling it's never a good deal

10:27.260 --> 10:32.020
for the better but, the reason why people engage in these deals is a fascinating study

10:32.020 --> 10:36.760
of behavioral economics and its principles, if applied correctly, can sometimes, just

10:36.760 --> 10:38.660
maybe, be used for good.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.140
What's also a good deal, though, is Squarespace.

10:41.140 --> 10:45.580
That's because if you're running any sort of business your first impression counts immensely

10:45.580 --> 10:48.660
and Squarespace helps you build the perfect first impression.

10:48.660 --> 10:52.580
No matter how small your business is it's absolutely crucial to have a website but of

10:52.580 --> 10:57.060
course it's expensive to hire someone to create one and complicate it to code one yourself.

10:57.060 --> 11:00.720
Squarespace makes it all easy with customizable designer templates, an easy to use website

11:00.720 --> 11:04.960
