00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
It was January 25th, 1969, and Boston, Massachusetts was buzzing.

00:06.000 --> 00:10.480
The night prior, thousands had poured into the Boston Garden to watch the future NBA

00:10.480 --> 00:13.280
champion Celtics play their arch-rival Philadelphia.

00:13.280 --> 00:17.480
The night following, the Boston fans would be back again in droves to cheer on the ascending

00:17.480 --> 00:19.520
Bruins of the NHL.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.720
As for that night, not far from the Garden, just five stops or ten minutes down the Orange

00:23.720 --> 00:28.320
Line, none other than Led Zeppelin was playing a four-hour set at the Boston Tea Party as

00:28.320 --> 00:33.520
part of their first ever North American tour that would go down as one of their best.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.960
For a city dealing with existential issues of urban decay, draconian renewal projects,

00:37.960 --> 00:42.200
redlining, and simmering racial tensions, the pulse of Boston's beating heart as a

00:42.200 --> 00:46.880
center of entertainment and culture was still unmistakable.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.120
And for a group of 2,000 protesters that was descending on the Statehouse that January

00:51.120 --> 00:54.680
day, the hope was to keep it that way.

00:54.680 --> 00:59.280
People Before Highways Day, as it became known, was a manifestation of bubbling frustration

00:59.280 --> 01:03.600
towards the direction of Boston's transportation network that threatened to turn the densely

01:03.600 --> 01:08.600
populated, richly historical colonial city into a car-centric roadscape.

01:08.600 --> 01:14.200
With the Interstate Act of 1956, and the subsequent arrival of I-93 traumatically bisecting communities

01:14.200 --> 01:18.600
through the heart of Boston, the expansion of massive roadways inside the city had only

01:18.600 --> 01:21.180
just begun by the 1960s.

01:21.180 --> 01:26.060
With the arrival of a new governor, Bostonians and the greater metro area protesters feared

01:26.060 --> 01:28.100
how far it'd go.

01:28.100 --> 01:33.180
For the highway-crazed urban planners, I-90 and I-93 weren't enough—the city also

01:33.180 --> 01:37.420
needed a connective inner beltway along with a few more expressways to split the distance

01:37.420 --> 01:39.540
between those already constructed.

01:39.540 --> 01:44.540
But in the eyes of a diverse set of stakeholders—working class Cambridge residents, black power, women's

01:44.540 --> 01:49.340
liberation, and Native American rights activists to union workers, along with Harvard and MIT

01:49.340 --> 01:53.660
professors—these planned roadways wouldn't make the city more accessible—they'd tear

01:53.660 --> 01:57.100
down homes and kill communities.

01:57.100 --> 02:00.060
So, they marched.

02:00.060 --> 02:03.260
Then something unprecedented happened.

02:03.260 --> 02:07.900
Against the tide of massive nationwide urban overhaul, and in response to the protests,

02:07.900 --> 02:13.180
Massachusetts's newly elected governor, Francis Sargent, declared a moratorium on

02:13.180 --> 02:14.660
highway construction.

02:15.100 --> 02:22.300
Then in 1972, he announced an outright construction freeze on highways inside Route 128.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.020
Rather than a massive expressway contouring the city's southwest corridor, it'd be

02:26.020 --> 02:30.980
mass transit lines—subways and commuter rails that got the state's green light.

02:30.980 --> 02:35.400
Boston was poised to remain for the people, and no system was better positioned to benefit

02:35.400 --> 02:39.580
from this countering of American convention than the Massachusetts Bay Transportation

02:39.580 --> 02:42.100
Agency, or MBTA.

02:42.540 --> 02:47.460
Boston, as a walkable, human-first city, already had its advantages.

02:47.460 --> 02:52.140
For one, it was designed before the car, making it uniquely dense—almost European.

02:52.140 --> 02:55.420
Second, it was home to a one-of-a-kind transit system.

02:55.420 --> 02:59.880
With the adoption of this law establishing the MBTA in 1964, the greater Boston area

02:59.880 --> 03:05.140
became the first combined cohesive regional transit system in America, as it accounted

03:05.140 --> 03:10.080
for Boston along with the 77 separate communities surrounding it.

03:10.080 --> 03:14.520
Under one big umbrella, and with a substantial tax base, were the Boston area bus lines,

03:14.520 --> 03:18.940
the streetcars and light rail, and the subway system—the very modes of transportation

03:18.940 --> 03:24.320
that would provide for commuters every morning, and those living within the city, every day.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.720
It was all falling into place.

03:26.720 --> 03:31.520
As the Boston anti-highway movement built momentum across the 1960s, the MBTA began

03:31.520 --> 03:32.800
to expand.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.680
The subway, or the T, adopted the standardized colored lines the system's now known for—the

03:37.680 --> 03:41.500
orange line running from North Boston to Forest Hills, the blue from Bowdoin Street

03:41.500 --> 03:46.240
to East Boston, the red from Harvard to South Boston, and the green running rapid transit

03:46.240 --> 03:49.080
from Riverside all the way through downtown.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.720
Then it got bigger and modernized.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.880
The orange line, formerly elevated, now went underground, streetcars on the green route

03:55.880 --> 04:00.280
were replaced with buses, and both ends of the red line pushed farther from downtown.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.080
Aside from a few holdovers on the green line, nearly all of the rolling stock was either

04:04.080 --> 04:07.840
replaced within the decade or had been replaced recently.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.380
By 1970, all the pieces were there.

04:10.380 --> 04:14.320
The nation's oldest subway, now organized in a one-of-a-kind regional structure with

04:14.320 --> 04:21.520
the support of state and local politicians, along with the city itself, was ready to boom.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.160
Then it didn't.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.680
Zoom to the 2020s.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.880
While the routes have changed some, and certain stops have flipped names, the promise of Boston

04:29.880 --> 04:33.200
subway has hardly materialized.

04:33.200 --> 04:38.480
Instead of pacing the future, it's a system that looks like it's frozen in time.

04:38.480 --> 04:42.640
What the arrival of federal regulators in 2022 served to say was that rather than the

04:42.640 --> 04:48.440
subway of the future or a quaint, reliable service of the past, the T was America's

04:48.440 --> 04:50.400
most dangerous.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.280
But by this time, close calls and outright crashes were not new.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.820
In 2008, at the farthest outskirts of the system along the green line's D branch,

04:58.820 --> 05:03.180
one westbound train missed a slow signal and catastrophically rear-ended the train

05:03.180 --> 05:04.180
ahead of it.

05:04.180 --> 05:08.180
While the first was moving at little more than a crawl, the second was cruising at 38

05:08.180 --> 05:13.300
miles or 61 kilometers per hour with the operator assumed literally asleep at the wheel on account

05:13.300 --> 05:17.900
of their struggles with sleep apnea that hadn't been identified in the hiring process.

05:17.900 --> 05:22.100
What exactly happened could never be ascertained in a post-accident interview by the National

05:22.100 --> 05:26.300
Transportation Safety Board investigators, though, as the operator died in the crash

05:26.300 --> 05:28.780
while another 14 were injured.

05:28.780 --> 05:32.540
Despite the unique circumstances, the crash wasn't a one-off.

05:32.540 --> 05:36.300
Less than a year later, another accident on the green line occurred underground near the

05:36.300 --> 05:37.880
heart of the city.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.020
This time, a bunch up of westbound traffic had created a full stop between Government

05:42.020 --> 05:43.900
Center and Boylston.

05:43.900 --> 05:49.620
Train 3808 had heated yellow and red signals and come to a stop, while train 3612 didn't,

05:49.620 --> 05:53.420
slamming into the stationary train at about 25 miles per hour.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.620
Injuring 68, the federal investigators again made their way to Boston, and after checking

05:57.620 --> 06:01.440
train brakes, signal lights, and underground sightlines, it was deemed that the operator

06:01.440 --> 06:06.420
had missed the warnings because they were trying to send a text.

06:06.420 --> 06:10.660
Operator error and ineffective vetting processes were to blame in both crashes, but the system's

06:10.660 --> 06:14.520
dangerous flaws were more structural than just individual mistakes.

06:14.520 --> 06:19.320
From 2019 to 2020, trains running the orange line near the Wellington stop derailed six

06:19.320 --> 06:24.140
separate times, once because of weather, the rest because of an unforeseen incompatibility

06:24.140 --> 06:26.900
between new rolling stock and old rails.

06:26.900 --> 06:32.940
Then, in 2022, the most horrific of recent accidents rocked the MBTA.

06:32.940 --> 06:36.380
Exiting a red-lined train, a passenger's arm caught in the door, but due to a short

06:36.380 --> 06:39.860
circuit within the train's wiring, rather than the train remaining stopped to clear

06:39.860 --> 06:46.020
the exit, it took off, ripping the man off the platform to a gruesome death.

06:46.020 --> 06:50.360
It was this accident that resulted in this 90-page report four months later that effectively

06:50.360 --> 06:55.540
quantified what was becoming increasingly obvious—Boston's subway system was the

06:55.540 --> 06:58.540
nation's most dangerous.

06:58.540 --> 07:03.580
It first pointed out that MBTA collisions and derailments far outpaced national averages,

07:03.580 --> 07:09.580
then it acknowledged that Boston rails, from 2017 to 2021, were responsible for an incredible

07:09.580 --> 07:16.020
94% of all light rail injuries nationwide.

07:16.020 --> 07:20.500
While safety, or lack thereof, rightly receives much of the attention when it comes to Boston's

07:20.500 --> 07:25.420
struggling subway, it also obscures another major limitation of the transit system—that

07:25.420 --> 07:28.280
it's just plain slow.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.580
Whether it's safety issues with worn infrastructure, maintenance projects, or upgrade installs,

07:32.580 --> 07:36.140
the T's running as slow as it ever has.

07:36.140 --> 07:40.880
There are so many speed restrictions, in fact, that the MBTA has released its own interactive

07:40.880 --> 07:45.680
tool to track where the slow zones are, and just how slow these sections get.

07:45.680 --> 07:51.260
As of early December, 2023, the subway system has a total of 179 slow zones, with around

07:51.260 --> 07:55.900
a quarter of all rail sections falling under speed caps that, in some cases, cut to as

07:55.900 --> 07:59.300
low as 3 miles, or 5 kilometers per hour.

07:59.300 --> 08:04.220
Then, on top of slowdowns, there's outright stops—the month-long closure of the Orange

08:04.220 --> 08:09.480
Line in summer of 22, the 16-day closure of the Red in the fall of 23, the 9-day closure

08:09.480 --> 08:14.120
of the Green Line in the winter of 23—all projects designed to stem spreading problems

08:14.120 --> 08:16.700
and keep the network hobbling along.

08:16.700 --> 08:20.980
While presented as solutions to slow zones, these full closures are really only keeping

08:20.980 --> 08:26.540
slow zones at bay, as the totals of slow time on each line have only gone up in recent

08:26.540 --> 08:27.540
years.

08:27.540 --> 08:33.140
In fact, since 2016, average speeds along the Orange, Red, and Blue lines have all decreased,

08:33.140 --> 08:37.180
signaling the continued prevalence of slow zones and the lack of efficacy of total closures

08:37.180 --> 08:39.900
to actually fix the problem at hand.

08:39.900 --> 08:44.040
Now, some of these problems are understandably hard to fix.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.900
Being the earliest American city to embrace the subway, Boston dug lines that put them

08:47.900 --> 08:52.060
at the forefront of subway development in the US, but left them with tight, screeching

08:52.060 --> 08:57.100
turns and extremely narrow tunnels across the network that makes access, alteration,

08:57.100 --> 08:59.160
and expansion difficult.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.460
On top of tight tunnels, the network's plagued by aging infrastructure—from worn rails

09:03.460 --> 09:08.460
to a fleet of train cars that mostly dates back to at least the 90s, or at worst, the

09:08.460 --> 09:09.820
60s.

09:09.820 --> 09:14.180
But no matter the reason for a slow zone or an outright closure, these service alterations

09:14.180 --> 09:17.540
are more than inconveniences—they're the difference between making it to work on

09:17.580 --> 09:21.820
time, they're the difference between picking up a kid from daycare on time, the very things

09:21.820 --> 09:26.460
that then inform choosing to take the subway in the first place, to re-up on a Charlie

09:26.460 --> 09:30.500
card, or, if one has the luxury, to just take a car.

09:30.500 --> 09:36.460
But the source of these cracks stem from the very foundation of the system—the mere shape

09:36.460 --> 09:40.460
of the T shepherded the subway towards its current death spiral.

09:40.460 --> 09:45.820
You see, this shape is the epitome of radial network design.

09:45.820 --> 09:50.340
Nearly every route originates from the downtown core and heads outwards at different angles

09:50.340 --> 09:51.900
towards the suburbs.

09:51.900 --> 09:56.700
This is quite typical among American subway systems—similarly sized systems in DC and

09:56.700 --> 09:59.000
Philadelphia look quite similar.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.820
But this certainly is not the global norm.

10:01.820 --> 10:07.880
The systems of London or Paris just look different—they're far more convoluted.

10:07.880 --> 10:12.080
Even more modestly sized systems like those of Copenhagen and Oslo have notably different

10:12.080 --> 10:14.980
shapes than their American counterparts.

10:14.980 --> 10:19.780
A system that does look similar to Boston's subway, yet on a larger scale, is its own

10:19.780 --> 10:22.940
commuter rail system, and this is no wonder.

10:22.940 --> 10:27.340
Radial networks such as these primarily service downtown commuters—people who live in the

10:27.340 --> 10:31.160
outskirts and work downtown—and they can service this simple out-and-back commuter

10:31.160 --> 10:34.300
demographic well, but they're not good for much else.

10:34.300 --> 10:39.380
If, for example, someone lives in Winter Hill and works in downtown Boston, the T provides

10:39.380 --> 10:44.220
an 18-minute commute that is both faster and cheaper than driving during rush hour.

10:44.220 --> 10:47.780
If that same person had a third node in their daily commute—let's say they played in

10:47.780 --> 10:51.500
a rec soccer league in Cambridge—they'd have a convenient outbound from work to this

10:51.500 --> 10:54.980
after-work activity, but getting home would be a problem.

10:54.980 --> 10:59.720
A trip that would take just 10 minutes by car or 40 minutes walking would take 45 minutes

10:59.720 --> 11:04.260
by subway, as this passenger would have to head all the way downtown, wait for a connection,

11:04.260 --> 11:06.580
then all the way back out to the suburbs.

11:06.580 --> 11:11.380
In practice, wealthier commuters likely won't do this and opt for the car instead, leaving

11:11.380 --> 11:16.260
radial networks like this with two core user demographics—those who use them for simple

11:16.260 --> 11:20.900
out-and-back commutes but otherwise drive, and low-income individuals who don't have

11:20.900 --> 11:21.900
another option.

11:21.900 --> 11:27.320
That's to say, this and other American subway systems have essentially developed as miniaturized

11:27.320 --> 11:31.660
commuter rail systems, disproportionately servicing the lower-income demographics that

11:31.660 --> 11:36.340
tend to live in the zone between wealthier downtowns and wealthier suburbs.

11:36.340 --> 11:40.540
This is in contrast to a system like Paris', whose less radial design allows for viable

11:40.540 --> 11:45.140
subway routings between most all destinations in the urban core, meaning it is competitive

11:45.140 --> 11:48.060
versus cars on trips with more than two nodes.

11:48.060 --> 11:53.260
But the difference in design matters even more when lines need to shut down.

11:53.260 --> 11:58.180
You see, Paris' Line 4 has been going through sporadic shutdowns across 2023 to allow for

11:58.180 --> 12:02.500
modernization work, but it hasn't been a big deal—what might normally be a non-stop

12:02.500 --> 12:06.940
trip typically turns into either a one-stop one, or one with a bit more walking, thanks

12:06.940 --> 12:09.820
to this overlapping, less radial design.

12:09.820 --> 12:13.760
For example, if one were trying to get from Gardinor to Saint-Placide, one could instead

12:13.760 --> 12:19.040
just take Line 2 from Barbroche-Arts to connect onto Line 12 down to Rennes—a 21 minute

12:19.040 --> 12:21.880
trip instead of the normal 16 minute one.

12:21.880 --> 12:25.180
The situation is very different in Boston.

12:25.180 --> 12:29.780
In 2017, for example, the red line was closed on weekends between Boston and Cambridge,

12:29.780 --> 12:34.660
and that meant there was simply just no subway option between Boston and Cambridge.

12:34.660 --> 12:38.940
A network like this becomes single point of failure which, in a system with as many maintenance

12:38.940 --> 12:44.260
issues as Boston's, means the entire line is unreliable to the downtown commuter demographic

12:44.260 --> 12:46.800
that it was primarily designed to serve.

12:46.800 --> 12:51.280
And what that leads to is a further degradation of the demographics that use it.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.140
The already shrunken demographic of commuters who only have simple out-and-backs can no

12:55.140 --> 13:00.180
longer rely on it, so they might commute by car instead, which they can always rely on.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.520
That focuses the ridership demographic even further into the primarily low-income group

13:04.520 --> 13:07.140
that has no other option.

13:07.140 --> 13:10.860
The direct solution is simple—ring routes.

13:10.860 --> 13:15.020
Intersections between lines, especially out of the downtown core, provide resiliency and

13:15.020 --> 13:19.180
improve the ability for subways to effectively service more than just the out-and-back commuter

13:19.180 --> 13:20.180
crowd.

13:20.180 --> 13:24.260
Not only that, but they divert traffic away from the downtown core where construction,

13:24.260 --> 13:28.720
operation, and maintenance is often trickiest and costliest due to density.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.980
This is something Boston clearly understands because it has these—ring roads.

13:33.980 --> 13:38.660
While the highway system is also primarily designed in a radial pattern, since so much

13:38.660 --> 13:43.340
traffic is headed in and out of Boston, it also has these two rings helping facilitate

13:43.340 --> 13:47.580
quick suburb-to-suburb routes that avoid the congested downtown core.

13:47.580 --> 13:52.020
Boston even understands this on the transit level too, as it once had unfunded plans to

13:52.020 --> 13:55.180
develop a ring rail system, but eventually it couldn't even get funding to develop

13:55.180 --> 13:58.660
the bus routes that comprised phase one of that plan.

13:58.660 --> 14:03.080
Other cities in America are also working to rectify this design flaw—after decades of

14:03.080 --> 14:07.240
pushback by some of the wealthier communities it passed through, the DC area is finally

14:07.240 --> 14:11.160
building a light rail line through its Maryland suburbs which will connect to the DC metro

14:11.160 --> 14:16.760
at four points, facilitating suburb-to-suburb routings that avoid the downtown core entirely.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.560
New York City, which already has a stronger subway system outside of its downtown core

14:20.560 --> 14:24.800
than perhaps any American city, is working on increasingly serious plans to build the

14:24.800 --> 14:29.200
so-called Interboro Express between Brooklyn and Queens to connect underserved communities

14:29.200 --> 14:34.640
in the city's outskirts to the subway system at 17 different connecting points.

14:34.640 --> 14:39.960
The T, meanwhile, has but a fragile design and an over-reliance on commuters.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.800
One can understand this by looking at its incredible morning and evening traffic peaks

14:43.800 --> 14:44.800
in 2019.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.940
But then COVID happened, and the commuters went away.

14:48.940 --> 14:52.880
With a more hybridized and flexible work schedule, fewer people are commuting daily to their

14:52.880 --> 14:57.340
downtown offices, and, when mixed with poor service, the T's passenger volume during

14:57.340 --> 15:01.340
commutes has nearly halved, while traffic overall has spread out more evenly throughout

15:01.340 --> 15:02.340
the day.

15:02.340 --> 15:07.840
Now, on the one hand, a more distributed ridership base is good for a transit system, as over-reliance

15:07.840 --> 15:12.400
on commuters makes for inefficient asset use—they have to have the capacity to move people when

15:12.400 --> 15:15.700
it's busy, while still paying for that capacity when it's not.

15:15.700 --> 15:20.580
But in Boston's case, considering the entire system was designed for those commuters, and

15:20.580 --> 15:24.700
it simply does not serve the transit patterns of other travelers as well, it's not like

15:24.700 --> 15:27.540
the commuter traffic just got replaced by other traffic.

15:27.540 --> 15:32.760
Rather, the commuter traffic just disappeared, leaving the T with a fraction of its previous

15:32.760 --> 15:33.760
ridership.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.340
The London Underground, as a point of comparison, has reached 90% of its pre-COVID ridership

15:38.340 --> 15:39.380
level.

15:39.380 --> 15:44.660
Across the US, most transit agencies have reached about 75% of pre-COVID levels.

15:44.660 --> 15:51.060
In Boston, only about half as many people ride the subway compared to before the pandemic.

15:51.060 --> 15:56.620
Now, like most transit agencies in America, the MBTA doesn't even come close to paying

15:56.620 --> 16:01.300
all of its expenses through fare revenue—pre-COVID, they only covered 43%.

16:01.300 --> 16:06.860
But pre-COVID, the MBTA was already in a dire financial situation.

16:06.860 --> 16:13.020
Now, with ridership halved and fare revenue down to 19% of costs, that dire situation

16:13.020 --> 16:14.900
has become downright existential.

16:14.900 --> 16:20.060
You see, in addition to decades of deferred maintenance, and a constant need to rectify

16:20.060 --> 16:24.700
staffing shortages with costly overtime, and brand new rolling stock with design flaws,

16:24.700 --> 16:30.740
and myriad other causes of exceptional costs, the MBTA just has a huge amount of debt that

16:30.740 --> 16:35.540
it's accrued from decades of trying to dig itself out of this deepening hole.

16:35.540 --> 16:42.100
In a given year, 20% of all MBTA costs are debt, and half of that is just interest on

16:42.100 --> 16:43.100
the debt.

16:43.100 --> 16:48.900
But interestingly, not all of the MBTA is in such an existential state.

16:48.900 --> 16:54.500
The agency is also responsible for a sprawling, region-wide system of bus routes, ferries,

16:54.500 --> 16:59.500
and commuter rail—and one component of that system has been a rare bright spot through

16:59.500 --> 17:02.540
all the turmoil—commuter rail.

17:02.540 --> 17:06.780
While not completely trouble-free, this network has been comparatively reliable throughout,

17:06.780 --> 17:10.180
and the MBTA even improved it for the better.

17:10.180 --> 17:14.460
Like many American commuter rail systems, the MBTA used to concentrate its assets almost

17:14.460 --> 17:16.420
entirely on the commuters.

17:16.420 --> 17:21.020
During the 2018 summer schedule, for example, the MBTA ran 20 trains a day from Worcester

17:21.020 --> 17:24.620
to Boston, with eight of those before 9am.

17:24.620 --> 17:28.460
In the middle of the day, there were only trains about once every two hours before higher

17:28.460 --> 17:30.940
frequency service in the evening hours.

17:30.940 --> 17:35.680
Nowadays, the MBTA still runs 20 trains a day from Worcester, but they're more evenly

17:35.680 --> 17:42.300
distributed throughout the day with at least hourly service between 4.15am and 10.25pm.

17:42.300 --> 17:46.240
This allows a more varied mix of passengers to use it, more like traditional regional

17:46.240 --> 17:50.180
rail transport, without worrying about being stranded in Worcester for two hours in the

17:50.180 --> 17:51.620
middle of the day.

17:51.620 --> 17:56.260
According to the agency itself, this shift towards less commuter-focused scheduling on

17:56.260 --> 18:00.780
this and other lines is a major factor behind its rather strong ridership.

18:00.780 --> 18:06.340
It's recovered to almost 95% of pre-COVID levels, meaning MBTA's commuter rail system

18:06.340 --> 18:11.380
is actually far outpacing average demand recovery relative to other American transit

18:11.380 --> 18:12.380
networks.

18:12.380 --> 18:17.640
Now, many are quick to point out perhaps the most glaring difference between the MBTA commuter

18:17.640 --> 18:20.940
rail and subway systems—the passengers.

18:20.940 --> 18:25.440
Boston commuter rail primarily connects those living in small, wealthy suburban towns to

18:25.440 --> 18:28.140
corporate jobs in downtown Boston.

18:28.140 --> 18:34.460
Correspondingly, just 22% of riders are from households with under $56,000 in annual income.

18:34.460 --> 18:41.480
Meanwhile, on the subway, this proportion ranges from 36 to 43%, depending on the line.

18:41.480 --> 18:47.160
Of course, there is a dirty truth that all transit systems confront—lower-income individuals

18:47.160 --> 18:48.620
rely on them.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.460
Higher-income ones don't.

18:50.460 --> 18:55.940
Therefore, many low-income T-riders will keep riding it no matter how bad service gets simply

18:55.940 --> 18:59.980
because they don't have another viable option.

18:59.980 --> 19:03.980
Higher-income riders, meanwhile, are perceived as the needle movers—they're the ones

19:04.020 --> 19:07.980
that have options, and therefore they're the ones whose ridership will make a difference

19:07.980 --> 19:12.240
considering American transit agencies, and especially their political leaders, often

19:12.240 --> 19:16.060
view getting cars off the road as their primary success metric.

19:16.060 --> 19:21.580
That's because, in the US, transit systems are pitched as alternative to cars, rather

19:21.580 --> 19:26.420
than creators of opportunity—after all, lower traffic is a message that can land with

19:26.420 --> 19:29.020
even the most transit-averse driver.

19:29.020 --> 19:33.680
Of course, many of the MBTA's issues stem from the fact that it did rely on these higher-income

19:33.680 --> 19:38.280
riders who are now gone, leaving them with an even greater budget shortfall.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.600
The most successful transit systems globally are also the ones that recognize that it's

19:42.600 --> 19:45.040
not an either-or situation.

19:45.040 --> 19:49.880
Well-designed mass transit is the best option for all, leading to reliance by all, which

19:49.880 --> 19:53.780
not only allows for a better-functioning city, but also levels the playing field between

19:53.780 --> 19:55.200
rich and poor.

19:55.200 --> 20:00.680
It means that physical access to job opportunities is more equal no matter one's existing financial

20:00.680 --> 20:01.960
situation.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.600
Physical mobility induces economic mobility.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.320
The disparity between the commuter rail and subway system go against this mission.

20:09.320 --> 20:14.560
It is easier in many cases for wealthier people to get to their downtown Boston jobs by rail

20:14.560 --> 20:19.040
than the lower-income individuals living physically closer, yet on the subway system, leading

20:19.040 --> 20:23.360
to the counter-intuitive situation where a wealthier person living further can get to

20:23.360 --> 20:28.560
a new higher-income downtown job easier than an equally qualified but less wealthy person

20:28.560 --> 20:32.940
living closer, creating opportunities for this transit system to perpetuate the economic

20:32.940 --> 20:36.120
divide rather than leveling the playing field.

20:36.120 --> 20:41.400
Now, the MBTA is overseen by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the state's

20:41.400 --> 20:42.400
governor.

20:42.400 --> 20:46.480
This, of course, creates opportunities for disproportionate focus, as with anything related

20:46.480 --> 20:50.080
to the American political system, considering a fundraising dinner for the next election

20:50.080 --> 20:54.080
is far likelier to take place in a commuter rail community than a subway one, given the

20:54.080 --> 20:55.640
disparity in income levels.

20:55.680 --> 21:00.480
Yet, the disproportionate focus on commuter rail can be traced more tangibly.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.920
Four of these seven seats are currently held by individuals with a direct professional

21:03.920 --> 21:07.040
connection to a community service by the MBTA.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.860
Mary Roberts represents Boston itself.

21:09.860 --> 21:13.960
Considering commuter rail is primarily an inbound system, this means this seat is disproportionately

21:13.960 --> 21:15.720
focused on the subway.

21:15.720 --> 21:19.880
Vice Chair Thomas Koch is mayor of the town of Quincy, one that is on both a commuter

21:19.880 --> 21:23.820
rail and subway systems, but is likely to be substantially reliant on commuter rail

21:23.820 --> 21:26.780
since it gets passengers downtown twice as fast.

21:26.780 --> 21:32.300
Then, there's Thomas McGee and Charles Hysitzky, mayors of Lynn and Framingham, both on the

21:32.300 --> 21:34.260
commuter rail systems exclusively.

21:34.260 --> 21:39.340
So that means that essentially two and a half of the four location-linked MBTA board seats

21:39.340 --> 21:43.900
are taken up by commuter rail rather than subway-focused individuals.

21:43.900 --> 21:47.500
This disproportionality becomes even more notable when considering that commuter rail

21:47.500 --> 21:51.580
only represents 10% of the MBTA's total ridership.

21:51.580 --> 21:53.740
The subway represents half.

21:53.740 --> 21:59.140
While it's hard to prove this board is disproportionately focusing resources and attention on commuter

21:59.140 --> 22:03.700
rail, it's a lot less hard to believe given its composition and the current status of

22:03.700 --> 22:05.340
the systems.

22:05.340 --> 22:09.600
This overall environment all feeds into the actual, nitty-gritty reasons why the T has

22:09.600 --> 22:13.580
been so dysfunctional—none of which are particularly novel nor exciting, and all of

22:13.580 --> 22:18.860
which are covered in the Federal Transit Administration's sprawling 90-page report on the MBTA's

22:18.860 --> 22:20.660
operational faults.

22:20.660 --> 22:25.260
Having an effective subway system is not some groundbreaking feat—it's being done all

22:25.260 --> 22:29.940
around the world by cities of all sorts of geographies, climates, and income levels.

22:29.940 --> 22:33.800
The reason why so many American systems struggle is not because the country doesn't know

22:33.800 --> 22:38.780
how to build good tunnels or maintain trains or schedule them effectively or anything like

22:38.780 --> 22:43.260
that, but rather that there's a culture of going halfway—creating rapid transit

22:43.260 --> 22:47.940
systems for the sake of having them, rather than for the end result of them actually being

22:47.940 --> 22:48.940
effective.

22:49.140 --> 22:54.960
The MBTA is in a very dire state—its one-off COVID-induced federal stimulus is nearly gone

22:54.960 --> 22:59.780
and it's on a fiscal cliff with no clear answers on how it'll pay its bills, let

22:59.780 --> 23:01.780
alone fix its issues.

23:01.780 --> 23:07.080
Yet all physical issues can be physically fixed with enough willpower.

23:07.080 --> 23:11.740
What can't be fixed as easily is the context with which American cities approach transport.

23:11.740 --> 23:16.060
It's been relatively easy for these systems to capture the reliant and the commuter, yet

23:16.060 --> 23:19.300
they almost all ignore everyone else.

23:19.300 --> 23:23.500
New York City is the notable exception—where the design, schedule, and system work for

23:23.500 --> 23:28.380
the reliant, the commuter, but also the kids heading to school, the after-work soccer player,

23:28.380 --> 23:30.060
the visiting tourist.

23:30.060 --> 23:34.220
This is perhaps the only place in America where a city and its transit have become so

23:34.220 --> 23:39.280
synonymous and it's created a rocky, yet unbalanced virtuous cycle towards increasing

23:39.280 --> 23:40.580
effectiveness.

23:40.580 --> 23:44.740
The MTA has its faults, and still struggles in comparison to its European counterparts,

23:45.300 --> 23:49.260
but it's not anywhere close to the MBTA situation.

23:49.260 --> 23:54.380
Altering the fundamental design of almost all American rapid transit systems is no small

23:54.380 --> 23:59.620
feat, and not something that can realistically happen in a context anywhere close to today's,

23:59.620 --> 24:05.320
but the path towards better American transit starts with a simple idea.

24:05.320 --> 24:11.060
Service shouldn't follow success, because service creates success.

24:11.060 --> 24:16.180
Grants gain passengers, leading to improvements, while failures lose passengers, leading to

24:16.180 --> 24:17.180
failures.

24:17.180 --> 24:22.460
So, the question—should we invest to start that virtuous cycle, or should we just let

24:22.460 --> 24:24.300
the vicious one happen?

24:24.300 --> 24:29.280
Now, I know this might go down in the record books of cheesiest ad-read transitions, but

24:29.280 --> 24:34.300
if you want to invest in creating a virtuous cycle, why not consider getting a Nebula lifetime

24:34.300 --> 24:35.300
membership?

24:35.300 --> 24:38.760
Earlier this year we tried this, offering one flat fee that'd give you access to Nebula

24:38.760 --> 24:42.240
for life, and weirdly people seemed to really like it.

24:42.240 --> 24:46.520
And I sort of understand why—there are simply too many subscription services out there,

24:46.520 --> 24:50.880
and there's something nice about just paying for something once and having it forever.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.680
Many of you also really believe in Nebula and its mission, which is incredible, and

24:54.680 --> 24:58.960
have said you justified the purchase due to the support it provides the platform and creators,

24:58.960 --> 25:00.760
and this is definitely the case.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.480
While all subscriptions of course help with that, getting the flat fee now allows us at

25:04.480 --> 25:08.760
Nebula to invest in content and development now, rather than when monthly or annual fees

25:08.760 --> 25:11.040
come in later, which speeds up platform growth.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.480
So that's why we brought back the annual offer for the holiday season—$300 and you

25:15.480 --> 25:18.520
get Nebula for life, it's as simple as that.

25:18.520 --> 25:24.560
But there's one brand new, highly requested way to get, or rather give, access to Nebula—gift

25:24.560 --> 25:25.560
cards.

25:25.560 --> 25:29.720
If you have a big Wendover or HAI or jet lag fan in your life, you can give them access

25:29.720 --> 25:31.720
to Nebula for life.

25:31.800 --> 25:35.960
Whether it's for you or someone else, access to Nebula will give access to every regular

25:35.960 --> 25:40.520
video by its curated group of hundreds of top-quality creators ad-free, plus access

25:40.520 --> 25:44.860
to an incredible catalog of bigger-budget original content—we have the most ambitious

25:44.860 --> 25:47.160
slate ever rolling out right now.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.980
For example, quite soon we'll release the Patrick Willems Christmas Special, featuring

25:50.980 --> 25:52.640
an appearance by yours truly.

25:52.640 --> 25:56.960
In 2024, we'll have some of our biggest releases ever, including some originals we

25:56.960 --> 25:59.680
at Wendover are working on right now.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.360
No matter how you want to get access to Nebula, whether it's monthly, annually, lifetime

26:03.360 --> 26:08.480
for you, or lifetime for someone else, do so at nebula.tv slash wendover.

26:08.480 --> 26:13.400
Not only will that get you 40% off an annual plan, bringing the cost down to just $2.50

26:13.400 --> 26:17.560
a month, but we'll also get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay

26:17.560 --> 26:21.760
subscribed, which provides stable, recurring revenue that we can reinvest into the channel.

26:21.760 --> 26:24.520
So thanks in advance for subscribing, and happy holidays.
