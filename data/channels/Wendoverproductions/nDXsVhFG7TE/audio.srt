1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It was January 25th, 1969, and Boston, Massachusetts was buzzing.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,480
The night prior, thousands had poured into the Boston Garden to watch the future NBA

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,280
champion Celtics play their arch-rival Philadelphia.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,480
The night following, the Boston fans would be back again in droves to cheer on the ascending

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,520
Bruins of the NHL.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,720
As for that night, not far from the Garden, just five stops or ten minutes down the Orange

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,320
Line, none other than Led Zeppelin was playing a four-hour set at the Boston Tea Party as

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,520
part of their first ever North American tour that would go down as one of their best.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,960
For a city dealing with existential issues of urban decay, draconian renewal projects,

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,200
redlining, and simmering racial tensions, the pulse of Boston's beating heart as a

11
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,880
center of entertainment and culture was still unmistakable.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,120
And for a group of 2,000 protesters that was descending on the Statehouse that January

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,680
day, the hope was to keep it that way.

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,280
People Before Highways Day, as it became known, was a manifestation of bubbling frustration

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
towards the direction of Boston's transportation network that threatened to turn the densely

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,600
populated, richly historical colonial city into a car-centric roadscape.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,200
With the Interstate Act of 1956, and the subsequent arrival of I-93 traumatically bisecting communities

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,600
through the heart of Boston, the expansion of massive roadways inside the city had only

19
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,180
just begun by the 1960s.

20
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,060
With the arrival of a new governor, Bostonians and the greater metro area protesters feared

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,100
how far it'd go.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,180
For the highway-crazed urban planners, I-90 and I-93 weren't enough—the city also

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,420
needed a connective inner beltway along with a few more expressways to split the distance

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,540
between those already constructed.

25
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,540
But in the eyes of a diverse set of stakeholders—working class Cambridge residents, black power, women's

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,340
liberation, and Native American rights activists to union workers, along with Harvard and MIT

27
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,660
professors—these planned roadways wouldn't make the city more accessible—they'd tear

28
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,100
down homes and kill communities.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,060
So, they marched.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,260
Then something unprecedented happened.

31
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,900
Against the tide of massive nationwide urban overhaul, and in response to the protests,

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,180
Massachusetts's newly elected governor, Francis Sargent, declared a moratorium on

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,660
highway construction.

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:22,300
Then in 1972, he announced an outright construction freeze on highways inside Route 128.

35
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,020
Rather than a massive expressway contouring the city's southwest corridor, it'd be

36
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,980
mass transit lines—subways and commuter rails that got the state's green light.

37
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,400
Boston was poised to remain for the people, and no system was better positioned to benefit

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,580
from this countering of American convention than the Massachusetts Bay Transportation

39
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,100
Agency, or MBTA.

40
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,460
Boston, as a walkable, human-first city, already had its advantages.

41
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,140
For one, it was designed before the car, making it uniquely dense—almost European.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,420
Second, it was home to a one-of-a-kind transit system.

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,880
With the adoption of this law establishing the MBTA in 1964, the greater Boston area

44
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,140
became the first combined cohesive regional transit system in America, as it accounted

45
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,080
for Boston along with the 77 separate communities surrounding it.

46
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,520
Under one big umbrella, and with a substantial tax base, were the Boston area bus lines,

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,940
the streetcars and light rail, and the subway system—the very modes of transportation

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,320
that would provide for commuters every morning, and those living within the city, every day.

49
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
It was all falling into place.

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,520
As the Boston anti-highway movement built momentum across the 1960s, the MBTA began

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
to expand.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,680
The subway, or the T, adopted the standardized colored lines the system's now known for—the

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,500
orange line running from North Boston to Forest Hills, the blue from Bowdoin Street

54
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,240
to East Boston, the red from Harvard to South Boston, and the green running rapid transit

55
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,080
from Riverside all the way through downtown.

56
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,720
Then it got bigger and modernized.

57
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,880
The orange line, formerly elevated, now went underground, streetcars on the green route

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,280
were replaced with buses, and both ends of the red line pushed farther from downtown.

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Aside from a few holdovers on the green line, nearly all of the rolling stock was either

60
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
replaced within the decade or had been replaced recently.

61
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,380
By 1970, all the pieces were there.

62
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,320
The nation's oldest subway, now organized in a one-of-a-kind regional structure with

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:21,520
the support of state and local politicians, along with the city itself, was ready to boom.

64
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,160
Then it didn't.

65
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,680
Zoom to the 2020s.

66
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,880
While the routes have changed some, and certain stops have flipped names, the promise of Boston

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,200
subway has hardly materialized.

68
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,480
Instead of pacing the future, it's a system that looks like it's frozen in time.

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,640
What the arrival of federal regulators in 2022 served to say was that rather than the

70
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,440
subway of the future or a quaint, reliable service of the past, the T was America's

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,400
most dangerous.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,280
But by this time, close calls and outright crashes were not new.

73
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,820
In 2008, at the farthest outskirts of the system along the green line's D branch,

74
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,180
one westbound train missed a slow signal and catastrophically rear-ended the train

75
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,180
ahead of it.

76
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,180
While the first was moving at little more than a crawl, the second was cruising at 38

77
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,300
miles or 61 kilometers per hour with the operator assumed literally asleep at the wheel on account

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,900
of their struggles with sleep apnea that hadn't been identified in the hiring process.

79
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,100
What exactly happened could never be ascertained in a post-accident interview by the National

80
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,300
Transportation Safety Board investigators, though, as the operator died in the crash

81
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,780
while another 14 were injured.

82
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,540
Despite the unique circumstances, the crash wasn't a one-off.

83
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,300
Less than a year later, another accident on the green line occurred underground near the

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,880
heart of the city.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,020
This time, a bunch up of westbound traffic had created a full stop between Government

86
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,900
Center and Boylston.

87
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,620
Train 3808 had heated yellow and red signals and come to a stop, while train 3612 didn't,

88
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,420
slamming into the stationary train at about 25 miles per hour.

89
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,620
Injuring 68, the federal investigators again made their way to Boston, and after checking

90
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,440
train brakes, signal lights, and underground sightlines, it was deemed that the operator

91
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,420
had missed the warnings because they were trying to send a text.

92
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,660
Operator error and ineffective vetting processes were to blame in both crashes, but the system's

93
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,520
dangerous flaws were more structural than just individual mistakes.

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,320
From 2019 to 2020, trains running the orange line near the Wellington stop derailed six

95
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,140
separate times, once because of weather, the rest because of an unforeseen incompatibility

96
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,900
between new rolling stock and old rails.

97
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,940
Then, in 2022, the most horrific of recent accidents rocked the MBTA.

98
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,380
Exiting a red-lined train, a passenger's arm caught in the door, but due to a short

99
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,860
circuit within the train's wiring, rather than the train remaining stopped to clear

100
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,020
the exit, it took off, ripping the man off the platform to a gruesome death.

101
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,360
It was this accident that resulted in this 90-page report four months later that effectively

102
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,540
quantified what was becoming increasingly obvious—Boston's subway system was the

103
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,540
nation's most dangerous.

104
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:03,580
It first pointed out that MBTA collisions and derailments far outpaced national averages,

105
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,580
then it acknowledged that Boston rails, from 2017 to 2021, were responsible for an incredible

106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:16,020
94% of all light rail injuries nationwide.

107
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,500
While safety, or lack thereof, rightly receives much of the attention when it comes to Boston's

108
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:25,420
struggling subway, it also obscures another major limitation of the transit system—that

109
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,280
it's just plain slow.

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,580
Whether it's safety issues with worn infrastructure, maintenance projects, or upgrade installs,

111
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,140
the T's running as slow as it ever has.

112
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,880
There are so many speed restrictions, in fact, that the MBTA has released its own interactive

113
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,680
tool to track where the slow zones are, and just how slow these sections get.

114
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,260
As of early December, 2023, the subway system has a total of 179 slow zones, with around

115
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,900
a quarter of all rail sections falling under speed caps that, in some cases, cut to as

116
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,300
low as 3 miles, or 5 kilometers per hour.

117
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,220
Then, on top of slowdowns, there's outright stops—the month-long closure of the Orange

118
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,480
Line in summer of 22, the 16-day closure of the Red in the fall of 23, the 9-day closure

119
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,120
of the Green Line in the winter of 23—all projects designed to stem spreading problems

120
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,700
and keep the network hobbling along.

121
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,980
While presented as solutions to slow zones, these full closures are really only keeping

122
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,540
slow zones at bay, as the totals of slow time on each line have only gone up in recent

123
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
years.

124
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,140
In fact, since 2016, average speeds along the Orange, Red, and Blue lines have all decreased,

125
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,180
signaling the continued prevalence of slow zones and the lack of efficacy of total closures

126
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,900
to actually fix the problem at hand.

127
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,040
Now, some of these problems are understandably hard to fix.

128
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,900
Being the earliest American city to embrace the subway, Boston dug lines that put them

129
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,060
at the forefront of subway development in the US, but left them with tight, screeching

130
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,100
turns and extremely narrow tunnels across the network that makes access, alteration,

131
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,160
and expansion difficult.

132
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,460
On top of tight tunnels, the network's plagued by aging infrastructure—from worn rails

133
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,460
to a fleet of train cars that mostly dates back to at least the 90s, or at worst, the

134
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,820
60s.

135
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,180
But no matter the reason for a slow zone or an outright closure, these service alterations

136
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,540
are more than inconveniences—they're the difference between making it to work on

137
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,820
time, they're the difference between picking up a kid from daycare on time, the very things

138
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:26,460
that then inform choosing to take the subway in the first place, to re-up on a Charlie

139
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,500
card, or, if one has the luxury, to just take a car.

140
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,460
But the source of these cracks stem from the very foundation of the system—the mere shape

141
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,460
of the T shepherded the subway towards its current death spiral.

142
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,820
You see, this shape is the epitome of radial network design.

143
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,340
Nearly every route originates from the downtown core and heads outwards at different angles

144
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,900
towards the suburbs.

145
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,700
This is quite typical among American subway systems—similarly sized systems in DC and

146
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,000
Philadelphia look quite similar.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,820
But this certainly is not the global norm.

148
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,880
The systems of London or Paris just look different—they're far more convoluted.

149
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,080
Even more modestly sized systems like those of Copenhagen and Oslo have notably different

150
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,980
shapes than their American counterparts.

151
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,780
A system that does look similar to Boston's subway, yet on a larger scale, is its own

152
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,940
commuter rail system, and this is no wonder.

153
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:27,340
Radial networks such as these primarily service downtown commuters—people who live in the

154
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,160
outskirts and work downtown—and they can service this simple out-and-back commuter

155
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,300
demographic well, but they're not good for much else.

156
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:39,380
If, for example, someone lives in Winter Hill and works in downtown Boston, the T provides

157
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:44,220
an 18-minute commute that is both faster and cheaper than driving during rush hour.

158
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,780
If that same person had a third node in their daily commute—let's say they played in

159
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:51,500
a rec soccer league in Cambridge—they'd have a convenient outbound from work to this

160
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,980
after-work activity, but getting home would be a problem.

161
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,720
A trip that would take just 10 minutes by car or 40 minutes walking would take 45 minutes

162
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,260
by subway, as this passenger would have to head all the way downtown, wait for a connection,

163
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,580
then all the way back out to the suburbs.

164
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,380
In practice, wealthier commuters likely won't do this and opt for the car instead, leaving

165
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,260
radial networks like this with two core user demographics—those who use them for simple

166
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,900
out-and-back commutes but otherwise drive, and low-income individuals who don't have

167
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
another option.

168
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,320
That's to say, this and other American subway systems have essentially developed as miniaturized

169
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,660
commuter rail systems, disproportionately servicing the lower-income demographics that

170
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,340
tend to live in the zone between wealthier downtowns and wealthier suburbs.

171
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,540
This is in contrast to a system like Paris', whose less radial design allows for viable

172
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,140
subway routings between most all destinations in the urban core, meaning it is competitive

173
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:48,060
versus cars on trips with more than two nodes.

174
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,260
But the difference in design matters even more when lines need to shut down.

175
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,180
You see, Paris' Line 4 has been going through sporadic shutdowns across 2023 to allow for

176
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,500
modernization work, but it hasn't been a big deal—what might normally be a non-stop

177
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,940
trip typically turns into either a one-stop one, or one with a bit more walking, thanks

178
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,820
to this overlapping, less radial design.

179
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:13,760
For example, if one were trying to get from Gardinor to Saint-Placide, one could instead

180
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,040
just take Line 2 from Barbroche-Arts to connect onto Line 12 down to Rennes—a 21 minute

181
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,880
trip instead of the normal 16 minute one.

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,180
The situation is very different in Boston.

183
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,780
In 2017, for example, the red line was closed on weekends between Boston and Cambridge,

184
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,660
and that meant there was simply just no subway option between Boston and Cambridge.

185
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,940
A network like this becomes single point of failure which, in a system with as many maintenance

186
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,260
issues as Boston's, means the entire line is unreliable to the downtown commuter demographic

187
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,800
that it was primarily designed to serve.

188
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,280
And what that leads to is a further degradation of the demographics that use it.

189
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,140
The already shrunken demographic of commuters who only have simple out-and-backs can no

190
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,180
longer rely on it, so they might commute by car instead, which they can always rely on.

191
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,520
That focuses the ridership demographic even further into the primarily low-income group

192
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,140
that has no other option.

193
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,860
The direct solution is simple—ring routes.

194
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,020
Intersections between lines, especially out of the downtown core, provide resiliency and

195
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,180
improve the ability for subways to effectively service more than just the out-and-back commuter

196
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,180
crowd.

197
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,260
Not only that, but they divert traffic away from the downtown core where construction,

198
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:28,720
operation, and maintenance is often trickiest and costliest due to density.

199
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,980
This is something Boston clearly understands because it has these—ring roads.

200
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,660
While the highway system is also primarily designed in a radial pattern, since so much

201
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,340
traffic is headed in and out of Boston, it also has these two rings helping facilitate

202
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,580
quick suburb-to-suburb routes that avoid the congested downtown core.

203
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,020
Boston even understands this on the transit level too, as it once had unfunded plans to

204
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,180
develop a ring rail system, but eventually it couldn't even get funding to develop

205
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,660
the bus routes that comprised phase one of that plan.

206
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,080
Other cities in America are also working to rectify this design flaw—after decades of

207
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,240
pushback by some of the wealthier communities it passed through, the DC area is finally

208
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,160
building a light rail line through its Maryland suburbs which will connect to the DC metro

209
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:16,760
at four points, facilitating suburb-to-suburb routings that avoid the downtown core entirely.

210
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,560
New York City, which already has a stronger subway system outside of its downtown core

211
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,800
than perhaps any American city, is working on increasingly serious plans to build the

212
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,200
so-called Interboro Express between Brooklyn and Queens to connect underserved communities

213
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,640
in the city's outskirts to the subway system at 17 different connecting points.

214
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,960
The T, meanwhile, has but a fragile design and an over-reliance on commuters.

215
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,800
One can understand this by looking at its incredible morning and evening traffic peaks

216
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
in 2019.

217
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,940
But then COVID happened, and the commuters went away.

218
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,880
With a more hybridized and flexible work schedule, fewer people are commuting daily to their

219
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,340
downtown offices, and, when mixed with poor service, the T's passenger volume during

220
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,340
commutes has nearly halved, while traffic overall has spread out more evenly throughout

221
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,340
the day.

222
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,840
Now, on the one hand, a more distributed ridership base is good for a transit system, as over-reliance

223
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,400
on commuters makes for inefficient asset use—they have to have the capacity to move people when

224
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,700
it's busy, while still paying for that capacity when it's not.

225
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,580
But in Boston's case, considering the entire system was designed for those commuters, and

226
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,700
it simply does not serve the transit patterns of other travelers as well, it's not like

227
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,540
the commuter traffic just got replaced by other traffic.

228
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:32,760
Rather, the commuter traffic just disappeared, leaving the T with a fraction of its previous

229
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,760
ridership.

230
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,340
The London Underground, as a point of comparison, has reached 90% of its pre-COVID ridership

231
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,380
level.

232
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:44,660
Across the US, most transit agencies have reached about 75% of pre-COVID levels.

233
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:51,060
In Boston, only about half as many people ride the subway compared to before the pandemic.

234
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,620
Now, like most transit agencies in America, the MBTA doesn't even come close to paying

235
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,300
all of its expenses through fare revenue—pre-COVID, they only covered 43%.

236
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,860
But pre-COVID, the MBTA was already in a dire financial situation.

237
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:13,020
Now, with ridership halved and fare revenue down to 19% of costs, that dire situation

238
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,900
has become downright existential.

239
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:20,060
You see, in addition to decades of deferred maintenance, and a constant need to rectify

240
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,700
staffing shortages with costly overtime, and brand new rolling stock with design flaws,

241
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:30,740
and myriad other causes of exceptional costs, the MBTA just has a huge amount of debt that

242
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,540
it's accrued from decades of trying to dig itself out of this deepening hole.

243
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:42,100
In a given year, 20% of all MBTA costs are debt, and half of that is just interest on

244
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
the debt.

245
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,900
But interestingly, not all of the MBTA is in such an existential state.

246
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,500
The agency is also responsible for a sprawling, region-wide system of bus routes, ferries,

247
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,500
and commuter rail—and one component of that system has been a rare bright spot through

248
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,540
all the turmoil—commuter rail.

249
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,780
While not completely trouble-free, this network has been comparatively reliable throughout,

250
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,180
and the MBTA even improved it for the better.

251
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:14,460
Like many American commuter rail systems, the MBTA used to concentrate its assets almost

252
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,420
entirely on the commuters.

253
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,020
During the 2018 summer schedule, for example, the MBTA ran 20 trains a day from Worcester

254
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,620
to Boston, with eight of those before 9am.

255
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:28,460
In the middle of the day, there were only trains about once every two hours before higher

256
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,940
frequency service in the evening hours.

257
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,680
Nowadays, the MBTA still runs 20 trains a day from Worcester, but they're more evenly

258
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:42,300
distributed throughout the day with at least hourly service between 4.15am and 10.25pm.

259
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,240
This allows a more varied mix of passengers to use it, more like traditional regional

260
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,180
rail transport, without worrying about being stranded in Worcester for two hours in the

261
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,620
middle of the day.

262
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,260
According to the agency itself, this shift towards less commuter-focused scheduling on

263
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,780
this and other lines is a major factor behind its rather strong ridership.

264
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,340
It's recovered to almost 95% of pre-COVID levels, meaning MBTA's commuter rail system

265
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,380
is actually far outpacing average demand recovery relative to other American transit

266
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
networks.

267
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,640
Now, many are quick to point out perhaps the most glaring difference between the MBTA commuter

268
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,940
rail and subway systems—the passengers.

269
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,440
Boston commuter rail primarily connects those living in small, wealthy suburban towns to

270
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,140
corporate jobs in downtown Boston.

271
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,460
Correspondingly, just 22% of riders are from households with under $56,000 in annual income.

272
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:41,480
Meanwhile, on the subway, this proportion ranges from 36 to 43%, depending on the line.

273
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:47,160
Of course, there is a dirty truth that all transit systems confront—lower-income individuals

274
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,620
rely on them.

275
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,460
Higher-income ones don't.

276
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,940
Therefore, many low-income T-riders will keep riding it no matter how bad service gets simply

277
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,980
because they don't have another viable option.

278
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Higher-income riders, meanwhile, are perceived as the needle movers—they're the ones

279
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,980
that have options, and therefore they're the ones whose ridership will make a difference

280
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,240
considering American transit agencies, and especially their political leaders, often

281
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,060
view getting cars off the road as their primary success metric.

282
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:21,580
That's because, in the US, transit systems are pitched as alternative to cars, rather

283
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,420
than creators of opportunity—after all, lower traffic is a message that can land with

284
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,020
even the most transit-averse driver.

285
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,680
Of course, many of the MBTA's issues stem from the fact that it did rely on these higher-income

286
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,280
riders who are now gone, leaving them with an even greater budget shortfall.

287
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,600
The most successful transit systems globally are also the ones that recognize that it's

288
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,040
not an either-or situation.

289
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,880
Well-designed mass transit is the best option for all, leading to reliance by all, which

290
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,780
not only allows for a better-functioning city, but also levels the playing field between

291
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,200
rich and poor.

292
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,680
It means that physical access to job opportunities is more equal no matter one's existing financial

293
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,960
situation.

294
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,600
Physical mobility induces economic mobility.

295
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,320
The disparity between the commuter rail and subway system go against this mission.

296
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,560
It is easier in many cases for wealthier people to get to their downtown Boston jobs by rail

297
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,040
than the lower-income individuals living physically closer, yet on the subway system, leading

298
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:23,360
to the counter-intuitive situation where a wealthier person living further can get to

299
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,560
a new higher-income downtown job easier than an equally qualified but less wealthy person

300
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,940
living closer, creating opportunities for this transit system to perpetuate the economic

301
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,120
divide rather than leveling the playing field.

302
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,400
Now, the MBTA is overseen by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the state's

303
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
governor.

304
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,480
This, of course, creates opportunities for disproportionate focus, as with anything related

305
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,080
to the American political system, considering a fundraising dinner for the next election

306
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,080
is far likelier to take place in a commuter rail community than a subway one, given the

307
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
disparity in income levels.

308
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,480
Yet, the disproportionate focus on commuter rail can be traced more tangibly.

309
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,920
Four of these seven seats are currently held by individuals with a direct professional

310
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,040
connection to a community service by the MBTA.

311
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,860
Mary Roberts represents Boston itself.

312
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,960
Considering commuter rail is primarily an inbound system, this means this seat is disproportionately

313
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,720
focused on the subway.

314
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,880
Vice Chair Thomas Koch is mayor of the town of Quincy, one that is on both a commuter

315
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,820
rail and subway systems, but is likely to be substantially reliant on commuter rail

316
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,780
since it gets passengers downtown twice as fast.

317
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,300
Then, there's Thomas McGee and Charles Hysitzky, mayors of Lynn and Framingham, both on the

318
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,260
commuter rail systems exclusively.

319
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,340
So that means that essentially two and a half of the four location-linked MBTA board seats

320
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,900
are taken up by commuter rail rather than subway-focused individuals.

321
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,500
This disproportionality becomes even more notable when considering that commuter rail

322
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,580
only represents 10% of the MBTA's total ridership.

323
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,740
The subway represents half.

324
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,140
While it's hard to prove this board is disproportionately focusing resources and attention on commuter

325
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,700
rail, it's a lot less hard to believe given its composition and the current status of

326
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,340
the systems.

327
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,600
This overall environment all feeds into the actual, nitty-gritty reasons why the T has

328
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,580
been so dysfunctional—none of which are particularly novel nor exciting, and all of

329
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,860
which are covered in the Federal Transit Administration's sprawling 90-page report on the MBTA's

330
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,660
operational faults.

331
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,260
Having an effective subway system is not some groundbreaking feat—it's being done all

332
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,940
around the world by cities of all sorts of geographies, climates, and income levels.

333
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,800
The reason why so many American systems struggle is not because the country doesn't know

334
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,780
how to build good tunnels or maintain trains or schedule them effectively or anything like

335
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:43,260
that, but rather that there's a culture of going halfway—creating rapid transit

336
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,940
systems for the sake of having them, rather than for the end result of them actually being

337
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,940
effective.

338
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,960
The MBTA is in a very dire state—its one-off COVID-induced federal stimulus is nearly gone

339
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,780
and it's on a fiscal cliff with no clear answers on how it'll pay its bills, let

340
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,780
alone fix its issues.

341
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,080
Yet all physical issues can be physically fixed with enough willpower.

342
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,740
What can't be fixed as easily is the context with which American cities approach transport.

343
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,060
It's been relatively easy for these systems to capture the reliant and the commuter, yet

344
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,300
they almost all ignore everyone else.

345
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,500
New York City is the notable exception—where the design, schedule, and system work for

346
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,380
the reliant, the commuter, but also the kids heading to school, the after-work soccer player,

347
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,060
the visiting tourist.

348
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,220
This is perhaps the only place in America where a city and its transit have become so

349
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:39,280
synonymous and it's created a rocky, yet unbalanced virtuous cycle towards increasing

350
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,580
effectiveness.

351
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,740
The MTA has its faults, and still struggles in comparison to its European counterparts,

352
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:49,260
but it's not anywhere close to the MBTA situation.

353
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:54,380
Altering the fundamental design of almost all American rapid transit systems is no small

354
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,620
feat, and not something that can realistically happen in a context anywhere close to today's,

355
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,320
but the path towards better American transit starts with a simple idea.

356
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,060
Service shouldn't follow success, because service creates success.

357
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,180
Grants gain passengers, leading to improvements, while failures lose passengers, leading to

358
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
failures.

359
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,460
So, the question—should we invest to start that virtuous cycle, or should we just let

360
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,300
the vicious one happen?

361
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:29,280
Now, I know this might go down in the record books of cheesiest ad-read transitions, but

362
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,300
if you want to invest in creating a virtuous cycle, why not consider getting a Nebula lifetime

363
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
membership?

364
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,760
Earlier this year we tried this, offering one flat fee that'd give you access to Nebula

365
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,240
for life, and weirdly people seemed to really like it.

366
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,520
And I sort of understand why—there are simply too many subscription services out there,

367
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,880
and there's something nice about just paying for something once and having it forever.

368
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,680
Many of you also really believe in Nebula and its mission, which is incredible, and

369
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,960
have said you justified the purchase due to the support it provides the platform and creators,

370
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,760
and this is definitely the case.

371
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,480
While all subscriptions of course help with that, getting the flat fee now allows us at

372
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,760
Nebula to invest in content and development now, rather than when monthly or annual fees

373
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,040
come in later, which speeds up platform growth.

374
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,480
So that's why we brought back the annual offer for the holiday season—$300 and you

375
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,520
get Nebula for life, it's as simple as that.

376
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:24,560
But there's one brand new, highly requested way to get, or rather give, access to Nebula—gift

377
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
cards.

378
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,720
If you have a big Wendover or HAI or jet lag fan in your life, you can give them access

379
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
to Nebula for life.

380
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,960
Whether it's for you or someone else, access to Nebula will give access to every regular

381
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,520
video by its curated group of hundreds of top-quality creators ad-free, plus access

382
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,860
to an incredible catalog of bigger-budget original content—we have the most ambitious

383
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,160
slate ever rolling out right now.

384
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,980
For example, quite soon we'll release the Patrick Willems Christmas Special, featuring

385
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,640
an appearance by yours truly.

386
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,960
In 2024, we'll have some of our biggest releases ever, including some originals we

387
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,680
at Wendover are working on right now.

388
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,360
No matter how you want to get access to Nebula, whether it's monthly, annually, lifetime

389
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,480
for you, or lifetime for someone else, do so at nebula.tv slash wendover.

390
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,400
Not only will that get you 40% off an annual plan, bringing the cost down to just $2.50

391
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,560
a month, but we'll also get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay

392
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:21,760
subscribed, which provides stable, recurring revenue that we can reinvest into the channel.

393
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,520
So thanks in advance for subscribing, and happy holidays.
