0	6000	It was January 25th, 1969, and Boston, Massachusetts was buzzing.
6000	10480	The night prior, thousands had poured into the Boston Garden to watch the future NBA
10480	13280	champion Celtics play their arch-rival Philadelphia.
13280	17480	The night following, the Boston fans would be back again in droves to cheer on the ascending
17480	19520	Bruins of the NHL.
19520	23720	As for that night, not far from the Garden, just five stops or ten minutes down the Orange
23720	28320	Line, none other than Led Zeppelin was playing a four-hour set at the Boston Tea Party as
28320	33520	part of their first ever North American tour that would go down as one of their best.
33520	37960	For a city dealing with existential issues of urban decay, draconian renewal projects,
37960	42200	redlining, and simmering racial tensions, the pulse of Boston's beating heart as a
42200	46880	center of entertainment and culture was still unmistakable.
46880	51120	And for a group of 2,000 protesters that was descending on the Statehouse that January
51120	54680	day, the hope was to keep it that way.
54680	59280	People Before Highways Day, as it became known, was a manifestation of bubbling frustration
59280	63600	towards the direction of Boston's transportation network that threatened to turn the densely
63600	68600	populated, richly historical colonial city into a car-centric roadscape.
68600	74200	With the Interstate Act of 1956, and the subsequent arrival of I-93 traumatically bisecting communities
74200	78600	through the heart of Boston, the expansion of massive roadways inside the city had only
78600	81180	just begun by the 1960s.
81180	86060	With the arrival of a new governor, Bostonians and the greater metro area protesters feared
86060	88100	how far it'd go.
88100	93180	For the highway-crazed urban planners, I-90 and I-93 weren't enough—the city also
93180	97420	needed a connective inner beltway along with a few more expressways to split the distance
97420	99540	between those already constructed.
99540	104540	But in the eyes of a diverse set of stakeholders—working class Cambridge residents, black power, women's
104540	109340	liberation, and Native American rights activists to union workers, along with Harvard and MIT
109340	113660	professors—these planned roadways wouldn't make the city more accessible—they'd tear
113660	117100	down homes and kill communities.
117100	120060	So, they marched.
120060	123260	Then something unprecedented happened.
123260	127900	Against the tide of massive nationwide urban overhaul, and in response to the protests,
127900	133180	Massachusetts's newly elected governor, Francis Sargent, declared a moratorium on
133180	134660	highway construction.
135100	142300	Then in 1972, he announced an outright construction freeze on highways inside Route 128.
142300	146020	Rather than a massive expressway contouring the city's southwest corridor, it'd be
146020	150980	mass transit lines—subways and commuter rails that got the state's green light.
150980	155400	Boston was poised to remain for the people, and no system was better positioned to benefit
155400	159580	from this countering of American convention than the Massachusetts Bay Transportation
159580	162100	Agency, or MBTA.
162540	167460	Boston, as a walkable, human-first city, already had its advantages.
167460	172140	For one, it was designed before the car, making it uniquely dense—almost European.
172140	175420	Second, it was home to a one-of-a-kind transit system.
175420	179880	With the adoption of this law establishing the MBTA in 1964, the greater Boston area
179880	185140	became the first combined cohesive regional transit system in America, as it accounted
185140	190080	for Boston along with the 77 separate communities surrounding it.
190080	194520	Under one big umbrella, and with a substantial tax base, were the Boston area bus lines,
194520	198940	the streetcars and light rail, and the subway system—the very modes of transportation
198940	204320	that would provide for commuters every morning, and those living within the city, every day.
204320	206720	It was all falling into place.
206720	211520	As the Boston anti-highway movement built momentum across the 1960s, the MBTA began
211520	212800	to expand.
212800	217680	The subway, or the T, adopted the standardized colored lines the system's now known for—the
217680	221500	orange line running from North Boston to Forest Hills, the blue from Bowdoin Street
221500	226240	to East Boston, the red from Harvard to South Boston, and the green running rapid transit
226240	229080	from Riverside all the way through downtown.
229080	231720	Then it got bigger and modernized.
231720	235880	The orange line, formerly elevated, now went underground, streetcars on the green route
235880	240280	were replaced with buses, and both ends of the red line pushed farther from downtown.
240280	244080	Aside from a few holdovers on the green line, nearly all of the rolling stock was either
244080	247840	replaced within the decade or had been replaced recently.
247840	250380	By 1970, all the pieces were there.
250380	254320	The nation's oldest subway, now organized in a one-of-a-kind regional structure with
254320	261520	the support of state and local politicians, along with the city itself, was ready to boom.
261520	263160	Then it didn't.
263160	264680	Zoom to the 2020s.
264680	269880	While the routes have changed some, and certain stops have flipped names, the promise of Boston
269880	273200	subway has hardly materialized.
273200	278480	Instead of pacing the future, it's a system that looks like it's frozen in time.
278480	282640	What the arrival of federal regulators in 2022 served to say was that rather than the
282640	288440	subway of the future or a quaint, reliable service of the past, the T was America's
288440	290400	most dangerous.
290400	294280	But by this time, close calls and outright crashes were not new.
294280	298820	In 2008, at the farthest outskirts of the system along the green line's D branch,
298820	303180	one westbound train missed a slow signal and catastrophically rear-ended the train
303180	304180	ahead of it.
304180	308180	While the first was moving at little more than a crawl, the second was cruising at 38
308180	313300	miles or 61 kilometers per hour with the operator assumed literally asleep at the wheel on account
313300	317900	of their struggles with sleep apnea that hadn't been identified in the hiring process.
317900	322100	What exactly happened could never be ascertained in a post-accident interview by the National
322100	326300	Transportation Safety Board investigators, though, as the operator died in the crash
326300	328780	while another 14 were injured.
328780	332540	Despite the unique circumstances, the crash wasn't a one-off.
332540	336300	Less than a year later, another accident on the green line occurred underground near the
336300	337880	heart of the city.
337880	342020	This time, a bunch up of westbound traffic had created a full stop between Government
342020	343900	Center and Boylston.
343900	349620	Train 3808 had heated yellow and red signals and come to a stop, while train 3612 didn't,
349620	353420	slamming into the stationary train at about 25 miles per hour.
353420	357620	Injuring 68, the federal investigators again made their way to Boston, and after checking
357620	361440	train brakes, signal lights, and underground sightlines, it was deemed that the operator
361440	366420	had missed the warnings because they were trying to send a text.
366420	370660	Operator error and ineffective vetting processes were to blame in both crashes, but the system's
370660	374520	dangerous flaws were more structural than just individual mistakes.
374520	379320	From 2019 to 2020, trains running the orange line near the Wellington stop derailed six
379320	384140	separate times, once because of weather, the rest because of an unforeseen incompatibility
384140	386900	between new rolling stock and old rails.
386900	392940	Then, in 2022, the most horrific of recent accidents rocked the MBTA.
392940	396380	Exiting a red-lined train, a passenger's arm caught in the door, but due to a short
396380	399860	circuit within the train's wiring, rather than the train remaining stopped to clear
399860	406020	the exit, it took off, ripping the man off the platform to a gruesome death.
406020	410360	It was this accident that resulted in this 90-page report four months later that effectively
410360	415540	quantified what was becoming increasingly obvious—Boston's subway system was the
415540	418540	nation's most dangerous.
418540	423580	It first pointed out that MBTA collisions and derailments far outpaced national averages,
423580	429580	then it acknowledged that Boston rails, from 2017 to 2021, were responsible for an incredible
429580	436020	94% of all light rail injuries nationwide.
436020	440500	While safety, or lack thereof, rightly receives much of the attention when it comes to Boston's
440500	445420	struggling subway, it also obscures another major limitation of the transit system—that
445420	448280	it's just plain slow.
448280	452580	Whether it's safety issues with worn infrastructure, maintenance projects, or upgrade installs,
452580	456140	the T's running as slow as it ever has.
456140	460880	There are so many speed restrictions, in fact, that the MBTA has released its own interactive
460880	465680	tool to track where the slow zones are, and just how slow these sections get.
465680	471260	As of early December, 2023, the subway system has a total of 179 slow zones, with around
471260	475900	a quarter of all rail sections falling under speed caps that, in some cases, cut to as
475900	479300	low as 3 miles, or 5 kilometers per hour.
479300	484220	Then, on top of slowdowns, there's outright stops—the month-long closure of the Orange
484220	489480	Line in summer of 22, the 16-day closure of the Red in the fall of 23, the 9-day closure
489480	494120	of the Green Line in the winter of 23—all projects designed to stem spreading problems
494120	496700	and keep the network hobbling along.
496700	500980	While presented as solutions to slow zones, these full closures are really only keeping
500980	506540	slow zones at bay, as the totals of slow time on each line have only gone up in recent
506540	507540	years.
507540	513140	In fact, since 2016, average speeds along the Orange, Red, and Blue lines have all decreased,
513140	517180	signaling the continued prevalence of slow zones and the lack of efficacy of total closures
517180	519900	to actually fix the problem at hand.
519900	524040	Now, some of these problems are understandably hard to fix.
524040	527900	Being the earliest American city to embrace the subway, Boston dug lines that put them
527900	532060	at the forefront of subway development in the US, but left them with tight, screeching
532060	537100	turns and extremely narrow tunnels across the network that makes access, alteration,
537100	539160	and expansion difficult.
539160	543460	On top of tight tunnels, the network's plagued by aging infrastructure—from worn rails
543460	548460	to a fleet of train cars that mostly dates back to at least the 90s, or at worst, the
548460	549820	60s.
549820	554180	But no matter the reason for a slow zone or an outright closure, these service alterations
554180	557540	are more than inconveniences—they're the difference between making it to work on
557580	561820	time, they're the difference between picking up a kid from daycare on time, the very things
561820	566460	that then inform choosing to take the subway in the first place, to re-up on a Charlie
566460	570500	card, or, if one has the luxury, to just take a car.
570500	576460	But the source of these cracks stem from the very foundation of the system—the mere shape
576460	580460	of the T shepherded the subway towards its current death spiral.
580460	585820	You see, this shape is the epitome of radial network design.
585820	590340	Nearly every route originates from the downtown core and heads outwards at different angles
590340	591900	towards the suburbs.
591900	596700	This is quite typical among American subway systems—similarly sized systems in DC and
596700	599000	Philadelphia look quite similar.
599000	601820	But this certainly is not the global norm.
601820	607880	The systems of London or Paris just look different—they're far more convoluted.
607880	612080	Even more modestly sized systems like those of Copenhagen and Oslo have notably different
612080	614980	shapes than their American counterparts.
614980	619780	A system that does look similar to Boston's subway, yet on a larger scale, is its own
619780	622940	commuter rail system, and this is no wonder.
622940	627340	Radial networks such as these primarily service downtown commuters—people who live in the
627340	631160	outskirts and work downtown—and they can service this simple out-and-back commuter
631160	634300	demographic well, but they're not good for much else.
634300	639380	If, for example, someone lives in Winter Hill and works in downtown Boston, the T provides
639380	644220	an 18-minute commute that is both faster and cheaper than driving during rush hour.
644220	647780	If that same person had a third node in their daily commute—let's say they played in
647780	651500	a rec soccer league in Cambridge—they'd have a convenient outbound from work to this
651500	654980	after-work activity, but getting home would be a problem.
654980	659720	A trip that would take just 10 minutes by car or 40 minutes walking would take 45 minutes
659720	664260	by subway, as this passenger would have to head all the way downtown, wait for a connection,
664260	666580	then all the way back out to the suburbs.
666580	671380	In practice, wealthier commuters likely won't do this and opt for the car instead, leaving
671380	676260	radial networks like this with two core user demographics—those who use them for simple
676260	680900	out-and-back commutes but otherwise drive, and low-income individuals who don't have
680900	681900	another option.
681900	687320	That's to say, this and other American subway systems have essentially developed as miniaturized
687320	691660	commuter rail systems, disproportionately servicing the lower-income demographics that
691660	696340	tend to live in the zone between wealthier downtowns and wealthier suburbs.
696340	700540	This is in contrast to a system like Paris', whose less radial design allows for viable
700540	705140	subway routings between most all destinations in the urban core, meaning it is competitive
705140	708060	versus cars on trips with more than two nodes.
708060	713260	But the difference in design matters even more when lines need to shut down.
713260	718180	You see, Paris' Line 4 has been going through sporadic shutdowns across 2023 to allow for
718180	722500	modernization work, but it hasn't been a big deal—what might normally be a non-stop
722500	726940	trip typically turns into either a one-stop one, or one with a bit more walking, thanks
726940	729820	to this overlapping, less radial design.
729820	733760	For example, if one were trying to get from Gardinor to Saint-Placide, one could instead
733760	739040	just take Line 2 from Barbroche-Arts to connect onto Line 12 down to Rennes—a 21 minute
739040	741880	trip instead of the normal 16 minute one.
741880	745180	The situation is very different in Boston.
745180	749780	In 2017, for example, the red line was closed on weekends between Boston and Cambridge,
749780	754660	and that meant there was simply just no subway option between Boston and Cambridge.
754660	758940	A network like this becomes single point of failure which, in a system with as many maintenance
758940	764260	issues as Boston's, means the entire line is unreliable to the downtown commuter demographic
764260	766800	that it was primarily designed to serve.
766800	771280	And what that leads to is a further degradation of the demographics that use it.
771280	775140	The already shrunken demographic of commuters who only have simple out-and-backs can no
775140	780180	longer rely on it, so they might commute by car instead, which they can always rely on.
780180	784520	That focuses the ridership demographic even further into the primarily low-income group
784520	787140	that has no other option.
787140	790860	The direct solution is simple—ring routes.
790860	795020	Intersections between lines, especially out of the downtown core, provide resiliency and
795020	799180	improve the ability for subways to effectively service more than just the out-and-back commuter
799180	800180	crowd.
800180	804260	Not only that, but they divert traffic away from the downtown core where construction,
804260	808720	operation, and maintenance is often trickiest and costliest due to density.
808720	813980	This is something Boston clearly understands because it has these—ring roads.
813980	818660	While the highway system is also primarily designed in a radial pattern, since so much
818660	823340	traffic is headed in and out of Boston, it also has these two rings helping facilitate
823340	827580	quick suburb-to-suburb routes that avoid the congested downtown core.
827580	832020	Boston even understands this on the transit level too, as it once had unfunded plans to
832020	835180	develop a ring rail system, but eventually it couldn't even get funding to develop
835180	838660	the bus routes that comprised phase one of that plan.
838660	843080	Other cities in America are also working to rectify this design flaw—after decades of
843080	847240	pushback by some of the wealthier communities it passed through, the DC area is finally
847240	851160	building a light rail line through its Maryland suburbs which will connect to the DC metro
851160	856760	at four points, facilitating suburb-to-suburb routings that avoid the downtown core entirely.
856760	860560	New York City, which already has a stronger subway system outside of its downtown core
860560	864800	than perhaps any American city, is working on increasingly serious plans to build the
864800	869200	so-called Interboro Express between Brooklyn and Queens to connect underserved communities
869200	874640	in the city's outskirts to the subway system at 17 different connecting points.
874640	879960	The T, meanwhile, has but a fragile design and an over-reliance on commuters.
879960	883800	One can understand this by looking at its incredible morning and evening traffic peaks
883800	884800	in 2019.
884800	888940	But then COVID happened, and the commuters went away.
888940	892880	With a more hybridized and flexible work schedule, fewer people are commuting daily to their
892880	897340	downtown offices, and, when mixed with poor service, the T's passenger volume during
897340	901340	commutes has nearly halved, while traffic overall has spread out more evenly throughout
901340	902340	the day.
902340	907840	Now, on the one hand, a more distributed ridership base is good for a transit system, as over-reliance
907840	912400	on commuters makes for inefficient asset use—they have to have the capacity to move people when
912400	915700	it's busy, while still paying for that capacity when it's not.
915700	920580	But in Boston's case, considering the entire system was designed for those commuters, and
920580	924700	it simply does not serve the transit patterns of other travelers as well, it's not like
924700	927540	the commuter traffic just got replaced by other traffic.
927540	932760	Rather, the commuter traffic just disappeared, leaving the T with a fraction of its previous
932760	933760	ridership.
933760	938340	The London Underground, as a point of comparison, has reached 90% of its pre-COVID ridership
938340	939380	level.
939380	944660	Across the US, most transit agencies have reached about 75% of pre-COVID levels.
944660	951060	In Boston, only about half as many people ride the subway compared to before the pandemic.
951060	956620	Now, like most transit agencies in America, the MBTA doesn't even come close to paying
956620	961300	all of its expenses through fare revenue—pre-COVID, they only covered 43%.
961300	966860	But pre-COVID, the MBTA was already in a dire financial situation.
966860	973020	Now, with ridership halved and fare revenue down to 19% of costs, that dire situation
973020	974900	has become downright existential.
974900	980060	You see, in addition to decades of deferred maintenance, and a constant need to rectify
980060	984700	staffing shortages with costly overtime, and brand new rolling stock with design flaws,
984700	990740	and myriad other causes of exceptional costs, the MBTA just has a huge amount of debt that
990740	995540	it's accrued from decades of trying to dig itself out of this deepening hole.
995540	1002100	In a given year, 20% of all MBTA costs are debt, and half of that is just interest on
1002100	1003100	the debt.
1003100	1008900	But interestingly, not all of the MBTA is in such an existential state.
1008900	1014500	The agency is also responsible for a sprawling, region-wide system of bus routes, ferries,
1014500	1019500	and commuter rail—and one component of that system has been a rare bright spot through
1019500	1022540	all the turmoil—commuter rail.
1022540	1026780	While not completely trouble-free, this network has been comparatively reliable throughout,
1026780	1030180	and the MBTA even improved it for the better.
1030180	1034460	Like many American commuter rail systems, the MBTA used to concentrate its assets almost
1034460	1036420	entirely on the commuters.
1036420	1041020	During the 2018 summer schedule, for example, the MBTA ran 20 trains a day from Worcester
1041020	1044620	to Boston, with eight of those before 9am.
1044620	1048460	In the middle of the day, there were only trains about once every two hours before higher
1048460	1050940	frequency service in the evening hours.
1050940	1055680	Nowadays, the MBTA still runs 20 trains a day from Worcester, but they're more evenly
1055680	1062300	distributed throughout the day with at least hourly service between 4.15am and 10.25pm.
1062300	1066240	This allows a more varied mix of passengers to use it, more like traditional regional
1066240	1070180	rail transport, without worrying about being stranded in Worcester for two hours in the
1070180	1071620	middle of the day.
1071620	1076260	According to the agency itself, this shift towards less commuter-focused scheduling on
1076260	1080780	this and other lines is a major factor behind its rather strong ridership.
1080780	1086340	It's recovered to almost 95% of pre-COVID levels, meaning MBTA's commuter rail system
1086340	1091380	is actually far outpacing average demand recovery relative to other American transit
1091380	1092380	networks.
1092380	1097640	Now, many are quick to point out perhaps the most glaring difference between the MBTA commuter
1097640	1100940	rail and subway systems—the passengers.
1100940	1105440	Boston commuter rail primarily connects those living in small, wealthy suburban towns to
1105440	1108140	corporate jobs in downtown Boston.
1108140	1114460	Correspondingly, just 22% of riders are from households with under $56,000 in annual income.
1114460	1121480	Meanwhile, on the subway, this proportion ranges from 36 to 43%, depending on the line.
1121480	1127160	Of course, there is a dirty truth that all transit systems confront—lower-income individuals
1127160	1128620	rely on them.
1128620	1130460	Higher-income ones don't.
1130460	1135940	Therefore, many low-income T-riders will keep riding it no matter how bad service gets simply
1135940	1139980	because they don't have another viable option.
1139980	1143980	Higher-income riders, meanwhile, are perceived as the needle movers—they're the ones
1144020	1147980	that have options, and therefore they're the ones whose ridership will make a difference
1147980	1152240	considering American transit agencies, and especially their political leaders, often
1152240	1156060	view getting cars off the road as their primary success metric.
1156060	1161580	That's because, in the US, transit systems are pitched as alternative to cars, rather
1161580	1166420	than creators of opportunity—after all, lower traffic is a message that can land with
1166420	1169020	even the most transit-averse driver.
1169020	1173680	Of course, many of the MBTA's issues stem from the fact that it did rely on these higher-income
1173680	1178280	riders who are now gone, leaving them with an even greater budget shortfall.
1178280	1182600	The most successful transit systems globally are also the ones that recognize that it's
1182600	1185040	not an either-or situation.
1185040	1189880	Well-designed mass transit is the best option for all, leading to reliance by all, which
1189880	1193780	not only allows for a better-functioning city, but also levels the playing field between
1193780	1195200	rich and poor.
1195200	1200680	It means that physical access to job opportunities is more equal no matter one's existing financial
1200680	1201960	situation.
1201960	1205600	Physical mobility induces economic mobility.
1205600	1209320	The disparity between the commuter rail and subway system go against this mission.
1209320	1214560	It is easier in many cases for wealthier people to get to their downtown Boston jobs by rail
1214560	1219040	than the lower-income individuals living physically closer, yet on the subway system, leading
1219040	1223360	to the counter-intuitive situation where a wealthier person living further can get to
1223360	1228560	a new higher-income downtown job easier than an equally qualified but less wealthy person
1228560	1232940	living closer, creating opportunities for this transit system to perpetuate the economic
1232940	1236120	divide rather than leveling the playing field.
1236120	1241400	Now, the MBTA is overseen by a seven-member board of directors appointed by the state's
1241400	1242400	governor.
1242400	1246480	This, of course, creates opportunities for disproportionate focus, as with anything related
1246480	1250080	to the American political system, considering a fundraising dinner for the next election
1250080	1254080	is far likelier to take place in a commuter rail community than a subway one, given the
1254080	1255640	disparity in income levels.
1255680	1260480	Yet, the disproportionate focus on commuter rail can be traced more tangibly.
1260480	1263920	Four of these seven seats are currently held by individuals with a direct professional
1263920	1267040	connection to a community service by the MBTA.
1267040	1269860	Mary Roberts represents Boston itself.
1269860	1273960	Considering commuter rail is primarily an inbound system, this means this seat is disproportionately
1273960	1275720	focused on the subway.
1275720	1279880	Vice Chair Thomas Koch is mayor of the town of Quincy, one that is on both a commuter
1279880	1283820	rail and subway systems, but is likely to be substantially reliant on commuter rail
1283820	1286780	since it gets passengers downtown twice as fast.
1286780	1292300	Then, there's Thomas McGee and Charles Hysitzky, mayors of Lynn and Framingham, both on the
1292300	1294260	commuter rail systems exclusively.
1294260	1299340	So that means that essentially two and a half of the four location-linked MBTA board seats
1299340	1303900	are taken up by commuter rail rather than subway-focused individuals.
1303900	1307500	This disproportionality becomes even more notable when considering that commuter rail
1307500	1311580	only represents 10% of the MBTA's total ridership.
1311580	1313740	The subway represents half.
1313740	1319140	While it's hard to prove this board is disproportionately focusing resources and attention on commuter
1319140	1323700	rail, it's a lot less hard to believe given its composition and the current status of
1323700	1325340	the systems.
1325340	1329600	This overall environment all feeds into the actual, nitty-gritty reasons why the T has
1329600	1333580	been so dysfunctional—none of which are particularly novel nor exciting, and all of
1333580	1338860	which are covered in the Federal Transit Administration's sprawling 90-page report on the MBTA's
1338860	1340660	operational faults.
1340660	1345260	Having an effective subway system is not some groundbreaking feat—it's being done all
1345260	1349940	around the world by cities of all sorts of geographies, climates, and income levels.
1349940	1353800	The reason why so many American systems struggle is not because the country doesn't know
1353800	1358780	how to build good tunnels or maintain trains or schedule them effectively or anything like
1358780	1363260	that, but rather that there's a culture of going halfway—creating rapid transit
1363260	1367940	systems for the sake of having them, rather than for the end result of them actually being
1367940	1368940	effective.
1369140	1374960	The MBTA is in a very dire state—its one-off COVID-induced federal stimulus is nearly gone
1374960	1379780	and it's on a fiscal cliff with no clear answers on how it'll pay its bills, let
1379780	1381780	alone fix its issues.
1381780	1387080	Yet all physical issues can be physically fixed with enough willpower.
1387080	1391740	What can't be fixed as easily is the context with which American cities approach transport.
1391740	1396060	It's been relatively easy for these systems to capture the reliant and the commuter, yet
1396060	1399300	they almost all ignore everyone else.
1399300	1403500	New York City is the notable exception—where the design, schedule, and system work for
1403500	1408380	the reliant, the commuter, but also the kids heading to school, the after-work soccer player,
1408380	1410060	the visiting tourist.
1410060	1414220	This is perhaps the only place in America where a city and its transit have become so
1414220	1419280	synonymous and it's created a rocky, yet unbalanced virtuous cycle towards increasing
1419280	1420580	effectiveness.
1420580	1424740	The MTA has its faults, and still struggles in comparison to its European counterparts,
1425300	1429260	but it's not anywhere close to the MBTA situation.
1429260	1434380	Altering the fundamental design of almost all American rapid transit systems is no small
1434380	1439620	feat, and not something that can realistically happen in a context anywhere close to today's,
1439620	1445320	but the path towards better American transit starts with a simple idea.
1445320	1451060	Service shouldn't follow success, because service creates success.
1451060	1456180	Grants gain passengers, leading to improvements, while failures lose passengers, leading to
1456180	1457180	failures.
1457180	1462460	So, the question—should we invest to start that virtuous cycle, or should we just let
1462460	1464300	the vicious one happen?
1464300	1469280	Now, I know this might go down in the record books of cheesiest ad-read transitions, but
1469280	1474300	if you want to invest in creating a virtuous cycle, why not consider getting a Nebula lifetime
1474300	1475300	membership?
1475300	1478760	Earlier this year we tried this, offering one flat fee that'd give you access to Nebula
1478760	1482240	for life, and weirdly people seemed to really like it.
1482240	1486520	And I sort of understand why—there are simply too many subscription services out there,
1486520	1490880	and there's something nice about just paying for something once and having it forever.
1490880	1494680	Many of you also really believe in Nebula and its mission, which is incredible, and
1494680	1498960	have said you justified the purchase due to the support it provides the platform and creators,
1498960	1500760	and this is definitely the case.
1500760	1504480	While all subscriptions of course help with that, getting the flat fee now allows us at
1504480	1508760	Nebula to invest in content and development now, rather than when monthly or annual fees
1508760	1511040	come in later, which speeds up platform growth.
1511040	1515480	So that's why we brought back the annual offer for the holiday season—$300 and you
1515480	1518520	get Nebula for life, it's as simple as that.
1518520	1524560	But there's one brand new, highly requested way to get, or rather give, access to Nebula—gift
1524560	1525560	cards.
1525560	1529720	If you have a big Wendover or HAI or jet lag fan in your life, you can give them access
1529720	1531720	to Nebula for life.
1531800	1535960	Whether it's for you or someone else, access to Nebula will give access to every regular
1535960	1540520	video by its curated group of hundreds of top-quality creators ad-free, plus access
1540520	1544860	to an incredible catalog of bigger-budget original content—we have the most ambitious
1544860	1547160	slate ever rolling out right now.
1547160	1550980	For example, quite soon we'll release the Patrick Willems Christmas Special, featuring
1550980	1552640	an appearance by yours truly.
1552640	1556960	In 2024, we'll have some of our biggest releases ever, including some originals we
1556960	1559680	at Wendover are working on right now.
1559680	1563360	No matter how you want to get access to Nebula, whether it's monthly, annually, lifetime
1563360	1568480	for you, or lifetime for someone else, do so at nebula.tv slash wendover.
1568480	1573400	Not only will that get you 40% off an annual plan, bringing the cost down to just $2.50
1573400	1577560	a month, but we'll also get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay
1577560	1581760	subscribed, which provides stable, recurring revenue that we can reinvest into the channel.
1581760	1584520	So thanks in advance for subscribing, and happy holidays.
