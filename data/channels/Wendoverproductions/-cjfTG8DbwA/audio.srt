4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,560
This is Indiana and this is Scotland.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,440
Both have a similar number of inhabitants, a similar size, and a similar population density.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,960
But here's Indiana's public transportation system and here's Scotland's.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,080
You want to get to Cooper, a town of 9,030 miles from the capital, that'll take you

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,520
55 minutes on a train that leaves every 30 minutes or an hour and 40 minutes on a bus

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,000
that leaves every 40.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,200
You want to get to Anderson, a town of 50,000 30 miles from Indiana's capital, well you're

11
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
out of luck.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,920
The only option is the car.

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,160
Antiquated technology, safety concerns, crumbling infrastructure, and non-existence, it's

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,160
not hard to argue that the US public transportation network is just not good.

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,320
Vast swaths of the US have no option but to drive because the alternative just is not

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
there.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,520
This has consequences on the environment, on economic mobility, on where people live,

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,080
the consequences of America's lack of solid public transportation almost defines American

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
culture.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,400
But it wasn't always like this.

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,460
The United States once had the best public transportation system in the world.

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,800
It was the admiration of countries worldwide and an essential factor allowing for the successful

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,940
western expansion of the country.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,440
It all started with this—the horse car.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,640
Now there were urban transportation systems before these horse drawn trams came along

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,600
but they weren't cheap and they weren't fast.

27
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,160
Roads generally weren't paved and there just wasn't the economic demand for high

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,620
frequency service because these carriages were rarely faster than walking.

29
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,200
But on rails, these horse cars were fast and one horse could pull a full load of passengers

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,680
thanks to the rails.

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,400
In its heyday, there were over 6,000 miles of horse car lines in the US.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,520
In comparison, the combined mileage of every tram, subway, light rail, and commuter rail

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,120
system in the US nowadays is 5,416.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,480
In 1880, 50 million people lived in the US.

35
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,600
Today, over 320 million.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,480
Around the turn of the century, many of those horse car systems were electrified.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,560
There were then 11,000 miles of street car track nationwide.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,960
The systems were absolutely everywhere.

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,400
Even tiny towns like Bangor, Maine, and Berlin, New Hampshire had street cars.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,500
So what happened?

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,600
How did the US go from having 11,000 miles of street car to 200?

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,160
How did the US go from having solid public transportation in towns big and small across

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,780
the country to how it is today?

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,520
The decline of the street car began just after the turn of the century.

45
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
That was when the automobile came around.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,480
By 1920, the car was starting to get to an attainable price point for the everyday individual.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,540
That was the real threat for the street car—not cars, but economical cars.

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,040
The street car received another blow in 1929—the Great Depression.

49
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,960
There were fewer people with jobs which meant fewer people who needed to commute and fewer

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:04,320
people who had the money to pay for transport so many lines were just not profitable anymore

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,560
and closed.

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,960
But then the street car received a stay of execution—World War II.

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,220
You see, during World War II, the US had the lowest unemployment rate in history—as low

54
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,140
as 1.2%.

55
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,560
There were tons of factory jobs to support the war so practically everyone who wanted

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,320
a job had a job.

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,260
That meant that there were tons more people now going to and from work and, even better

58
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,800
for the street car, there were rations going on on rubber and gas which diminished the

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,340
popularity of the car.

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,340
But something else was going on through all that—something more sinister.

61
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:41,860
Sometime in the 1920s, automobile technology became advanced enough that the bus became

62
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,000
cheaper to operate than the street car.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,620
Street cars cost very little to power, but they do require a lot of infrastructure from

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,740
overhead lines to track.

65
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,720
Buses were more flexible and required almost no infrastructure and the bus had some powerful

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,460
friends—the automobile companies, or more specifically, General Motors.

67
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,720
General Motors went and bought dozens of small street car companies across the nation and

68
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,440
turned them into bus companies.

69
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,000
They removed hundreds of miles of track across the US and supported other companies doing

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,560
the same, but it's not like they didn't have a good reason to do this.

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,780
These street cars were not economically advantageous.

72
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:22,320
Buses were faster, cheaper, and at the time, they were the modern and fresh transportation

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
method that the public wanted.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,300
Nearly every street car system nationwide was replaced with a bus system.

75
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,440
In addition, the street car companies were almost all commercial so if and when they

76
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,200
failed many local governments set up public, subsidized bus companies.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,520
So that's how transportation got bad, but why did it stay bad?

78
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,480
Well, mostly because of the car.

79
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,920
America is the country of the car.

80
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,500
It grew up as the car grew up so its cities were built for cars.

81
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,760
Think Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles—you can't survive in these cities without a car.

82
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,000
Remember, the United States is centered around the idea of personal freedom.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,060
With a car, you can go anywhere at any time.

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,120
So politically, cars have historically been associated with the idea of personal freedom.

85
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,520
Just like the Republican party votes to have strong national defense, allow gun ownership,

86
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,460
and preserve small government in order to promote personal freedom, they have always

87
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,540
worked to promote the usage and ownership of cars.

88
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,140
That means they often voted in favor of subsidies helping the auto industry, most often in the

89
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,880
form of indirect subsidies lowering the cost of gas.

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,500
Now that was fine when cities were small, highways were new, gas was cheap, and climate

91
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,160
change wasn't even a concept, but that's not the case anymore.

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,180
Cities are just of a size where they literally cannot support their entire population driving.

93
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,260
You can't fit more road infrastructure in many cities, but you can fit more public transportation.

94
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:50,760
Cars were available to the common American much earlier than the common European so the

95
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:56,680
US set road policies early that allowed for large, smooth, and well-functioning roads.

96
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,840
While the US was building its magnificent roads, Europe was building their public transportation

97
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
systems.

98
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,140
High car usage in the US even has to do with zoning.

99
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,940
You see, European cities tend to have less strict zoning laws which allow for businesses

100
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
and housing to intermingle.

101
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,020
The US zones its cities much more strictly.

102
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,120
Houses are next to houses and businesses are next to businesses which means that the distance

103
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,740
between houses and shops in the US is much greater.

104
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,100
Therefore, Americans have to go further more often.

105
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,260
The most demonstrative fact is how the two places approach parking.

106
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:36,080
In the US, zoning laws specify a minimum number of parking spaces per building.

107
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,480
In Europe, the laws specify a maximum number of parking spaces.

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,860
The three cities with the three lowest car ownership rates in the US all have something

109
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,860
in common.

110
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,940
Boston, New York, and DC are all old, rather compact cities with decent public transportation

111
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
systems.

112
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,400
Since they were cities before the car, they're built much more like the European cities that

113
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,480
have such good public transportation systems today.

114
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,520
simplified, public transportation gets worse as you go further west since western cities

115
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
are newer.

116
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,560
But here's the most important sentence of this entire video.

117
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,260
Access to transportation is the single most important factor in an individual's ability

118
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,760
to escape poverty.

119
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,900
That is not a subjective claim that is a fact that emerged from a Harvard study.

120
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,920
Someone who lives right by a subway stop is astronomically more likely to find a high-paying

121
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,540
job than someone who doesn't have a way to get around.

122
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,140
Individuals in poverty generally live in poor neighborhoods with few job opportunities,

123
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,020
but with reliable, accessible, and inexpensive public transportation, these individuals can

124
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,100
get all across their city to where the jobs are.

125
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,160
So, a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of a public transportation system is by how

126
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,900
well it serves the poor.

127
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,400
DC, for example, does a good job of this.

128
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,140
The poorest neighborhoods have the greatest proportion of their residents within a ten

129
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,460
minute walk of a metro station while the richest neighborhoods have the smallest proportion.

130
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,060
Hand in hand with their move back into the cities, millennials are shunning cars.

131
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:11,320
Car ownership among young people is at historic lows and the urban youth is relying more and

132
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,360
more on public transport.

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,480
Some cities like Portland, Kansas City, Detroit, and DC are turning back to streetcars.

134
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,000
Done right, streetcars can drive huge increases in economic development.

135
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,540
They're more of a symbol of modernization that entices residents, developers, and businesses

136
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
to areas.

137
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:36,100
Portland, for example, has had an estimated $5 billion in extra economic development thanks

138
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,380
to its streetcar.

139
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,940
New streetcar systems are being built all across the US in cities like Milwaukee and

140
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,660
Oklahoma City since they're finally making money again—not from their fares, but from

141
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,140
the jobs brought by their existence.

142
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,480
People didn't want them a century ago, but streetcars finally make sense again.

143
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,700
Public transportation is instrumentally important to the success of cities.

144
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,100
You can almost be sure that a good city will have good public transportation and a bad

145
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,940
city will have bad public transportation.

146
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,280
Public transportation increases economic mobility, decreases carbon footprints, and increases

147
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,100
economic development so the only question is, why not build more of it?

148
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,060
One of the most common requests I receive is for a behind the scenes video and I've

149
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,060
finally made one.

150
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,020
I've partnered up with Skillshare to post it on their platform.

151
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,380
The course is mainly geared to people who already do or want to create their own videos

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,660
but it should be interesting for anyone.

153
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,960
If you're not interested in that in particular, Skillshare has over 16,000 classes about pretty

154
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,380
much anything and everything which you can watch from anywhere including when you're

155
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,500
offline by using their iOS or Android apps.

156
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,300
An annual membership gives you unlimited access to their classes for less than $10 a month

157
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,800
but the first 500 people to sign up over at skl.sh slash wendover can learn whatever they

158
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,140
want on Skillshare for free for their first two months including my behind the scenes

159
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,780
course which is also linked in the description.
