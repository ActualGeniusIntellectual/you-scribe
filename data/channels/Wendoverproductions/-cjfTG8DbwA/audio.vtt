00:10.640 --> 00:13.560
This is Indiana and this is Scotland.

00:13.560 --> 00:18.440
Both have a similar number of inhabitants, a similar size, and a similar population density.

00:18.440 --> 00:22.960
But here's Indiana's public transportation system and here's Scotland's.

00:22.960 --> 00:27.080
You want to get to Cooper, a town of 9,030 miles from the capital, that'll take you

00:27.080 --> 00:31.520
55 minutes on a train that leaves every 30 minutes or an hour and 40 minutes on a bus

00:31.520 --> 00:33.000
that leaves every 40.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.200
You want to get to Anderson, a town of 50,000 30 miles from Indiana's capital, well you're

00:38.200 --> 00:39.200
out of luck.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.920
The only option is the car.

00:40.920 --> 00:46.160
Antiquated technology, safety concerns, crumbling infrastructure, and non-existence, it's

00:46.160 --> 00:51.160
not hard to argue that the US public transportation network is just not good.

00:51.160 --> 00:56.320
Vast swaths of the US have no option but to drive because the alternative just is not

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
there.

00:57.320 --> 01:01.520
This has consequences on the environment, on economic mobility, on where people live,

01:01.520 --> 01:07.080
the consequences of America's lack of solid public transportation almost defines American

01:07.080 --> 01:08.080
culture.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.400
But it wasn't always like this.

01:09.400 --> 01:14.460
The United States once had the best public transportation system in the world.

01:14.460 --> 01:19.800
It was the admiration of countries worldwide and an essential factor allowing for the successful

01:19.800 --> 01:21.940
western expansion of the country.

01:21.940 --> 01:24.440
It all started with this—the horse car.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.640
Now there were urban transportation systems before these horse drawn trams came along

01:28.640 --> 01:31.600
but they weren't cheap and they weren't fast.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.160
Roads generally weren't paved and there just wasn't the economic demand for high

01:35.160 --> 01:39.620
frequency service because these carriages were rarely faster than walking.

01:39.620 --> 01:44.200
But on rails, these horse cars were fast and one horse could pull a full load of passengers

01:44.200 --> 01:45.680
thanks to the rails.

01:45.680 --> 01:50.400
In its heyday, there were over 6,000 miles of horse car lines in the US.

01:50.400 --> 01:55.520
In comparison, the combined mileage of every tram, subway, light rail, and commuter rail

01:55.520 --> 02:00.120
system in the US nowadays is 5,416.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.480
In 1880, 50 million people lived in the US.

02:03.480 --> 02:06.600
Today, over 320 million.

02:06.600 --> 02:10.480
Around the turn of the century, many of those horse car systems were electrified.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.560
There were then 11,000 miles of street car track nationwide.

02:14.560 --> 02:16.960
The systems were absolutely everywhere.

02:16.960 --> 02:21.400
Even tiny towns like Bangor, Maine, and Berlin, New Hampshire had street cars.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.500
So what happened?

02:22.500 --> 02:27.600
How did the US go from having 11,000 miles of street car to 200?

02:27.600 --> 02:32.160
How did the US go from having solid public transportation in towns big and small across

02:32.160 --> 02:34.780
the country to how it is today?

02:34.780 --> 02:38.520
The decline of the street car began just after the turn of the century.

02:38.520 --> 02:40.520
That was when the automobile came around.

02:40.520 --> 02:45.480
By 1920, the car was starting to get to an attainable price point for the everyday individual.

02:45.480 --> 02:50.540
That was the real threat for the street car—not cars, but economical cars.

02:50.540 --> 02:55.040
The street car received another blow in 1929—the Great Depression.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.960
There were fewer people with jobs which meant fewer people who needed to commute and fewer

02:58.960 --> 03:04.320
people who had the money to pay for transport so many lines were just not profitable anymore

03:04.320 --> 03:05.560
and closed.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.960
But then the street car received a stay of execution—World War II.

03:09.960 --> 03:15.220
You see, during World War II, the US had the lowest unemployment rate in history—as low

03:15.220 --> 03:17.140
as 1.2%.

03:17.140 --> 03:21.560
There were tons of factory jobs to support the war so practically everyone who wanted

03:21.560 --> 03:23.320
a job had a job.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.260
That meant that there were tons more people now going to and from work and, even better

03:27.260 --> 03:31.800
for the street car, there were rations going on on rubber and gas which diminished the

03:31.800 --> 03:33.340
popularity of the car.

03:33.340 --> 03:37.340
But something else was going on through all that—something more sinister.

03:37.340 --> 03:41.860
Sometime in the 1920s, automobile technology became advanced enough that the bus became

03:41.860 --> 03:44.000
cheaper to operate than the street car.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.620
Street cars cost very little to power, but they do require a lot of infrastructure from

03:48.620 --> 03:50.740
overhead lines to track.

03:50.740 --> 03:55.720
Buses were more flexible and required almost no infrastructure and the bus had some powerful

03:55.720 --> 04:00.460
friends—the automobile companies, or more specifically, General Motors.

04:00.460 --> 04:04.720
General Motors went and bought dozens of small street car companies across the nation and

04:04.720 --> 04:06.440
turned them into bus companies.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.000
They removed hundreds of miles of track across the US and supported other companies doing

04:11.000 --> 04:14.560
the same, but it's not like they didn't have a good reason to do this.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.780
These street cars were not economically advantageous.

04:17.780 --> 04:22.320
Buses were faster, cheaper, and at the time, they were the modern and fresh transportation

04:22.320 --> 04:24.000
method that the public wanted.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.300
Nearly every street car system nationwide was replaced with a bus system.

04:28.300 --> 04:32.440
In addition, the street car companies were almost all commercial so if and when they

04:32.440 --> 04:37.200
failed many local governments set up public, subsidized bus companies.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.520
So that's how transportation got bad, but why did it stay bad?

04:41.520 --> 04:43.480
Well, mostly because of the car.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.920
America is the country of the car.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.500
It grew up as the car grew up so its cities were built for cars.

04:49.500 --> 04:54.760
Think Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles—you can't survive in these cities without a car.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.000
Remember, the United States is centered around the idea of personal freedom.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.060
With a car, you can go anywhere at any time.

05:02.060 --> 05:07.120
So politically, cars have historically been associated with the idea of personal freedom.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.520
Just like the Republican party votes to have strong national defense, allow gun ownership,

05:11.520 --> 05:15.460
and preserve small government in order to promote personal freedom, they have always

05:15.460 --> 05:18.540
worked to promote the usage and ownership of cars.

05:18.540 --> 05:23.140
That means they often voted in favor of subsidies helping the auto industry, most often in the

05:23.140 --> 05:26.880
form of indirect subsidies lowering the cost of gas.

05:26.880 --> 05:31.500
Now that was fine when cities were small, highways were new, gas was cheap, and climate

05:31.500 --> 05:35.160
change wasn't even a concept, but that's not the case anymore.

05:35.160 --> 05:40.180
Cities are just of a size where they literally cannot support their entire population driving.

05:40.180 --> 05:46.260
You can't fit more road infrastructure in many cities, but you can fit more public transportation.

05:46.260 --> 05:50.760
Cars were available to the common American much earlier than the common European so the

05:50.760 --> 05:56.680
US set road policies early that allowed for large, smooth, and well-functioning roads.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.840
While the US was building its magnificent roads, Europe was building their public transportation

06:01.840 --> 06:02.840
systems.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.140
High car usage in the US even has to do with zoning.

06:06.140 --> 06:10.940
You see, European cities tend to have less strict zoning laws which allow for businesses

06:10.940 --> 06:12.940
and housing to intermingle.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.020
The US zones its cities much more strictly.

06:16.020 --> 06:20.120
Houses are next to houses and businesses are next to businesses which means that the distance

06:20.120 --> 06:23.740
between houses and shops in the US is much greater.

06:23.740 --> 06:27.100
Therefore, Americans have to go further more often.

06:27.100 --> 06:31.260
The most demonstrative fact is how the two places approach parking.

06:31.260 --> 06:36.080
In the US, zoning laws specify a minimum number of parking spaces per building.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.480
In Europe, the laws specify a maximum number of parking spaces.

06:40.480 --> 06:44.860
The three cities with the three lowest car ownership rates in the US all have something

06:44.860 --> 06:45.860
in common.

06:45.860 --> 06:51.940
Boston, New York, and DC are all old, rather compact cities with decent public transportation

06:51.940 --> 06:52.940
systems.

06:52.940 --> 06:57.400
Since they were cities before the car, they're built much more like the European cities that

06:57.400 --> 07:00.480
have such good public transportation systems today.

07:00.480 --> 07:05.520
simplified, public transportation gets worse as you go further west since western cities

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
are newer.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.560
But here's the most important sentence of this entire video.

07:10.560 --> 07:15.260
Access to transportation is the single most important factor in an individual's ability

07:15.260 --> 07:16.760
to escape poverty.

07:16.760 --> 07:21.900
That is not a subjective claim that is a fact that emerged from a Harvard study.

07:21.900 --> 07:26.920
Someone who lives right by a subway stop is astronomically more likely to find a high-paying

07:26.920 --> 07:30.540
job than someone who doesn't have a way to get around.

07:30.540 --> 07:35.140
Individuals in poverty generally live in poor neighborhoods with few job opportunities,

07:35.140 --> 07:40.020
but with reliable, accessible, and inexpensive public transportation, these individuals can

07:40.020 --> 07:43.100
get all across their city to where the jobs are.

07:43.100 --> 07:48.160
So, a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of a public transportation system is by how

07:48.160 --> 07:49.900
well it serves the poor.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.400
DC, for example, does a good job of this.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.140
The poorest neighborhoods have the greatest proportion of their residents within a ten

07:56.160 --> 08:01.460
minute walk of a metro station while the richest neighborhoods have the smallest proportion.

08:01.460 --> 08:06.060
Hand in hand with their move back into the cities, millennials are shunning cars.

08:06.060 --> 08:11.320
Car ownership among young people is at historic lows and the urban youth is relying more and

08:11.320 --> 08:13.360
more on public transport.

08:13.360 --> 08:18.480
Some cities like Portland, Kansas City, Detroit, and DC are turning back to streetcars.

08:18.480 --> 08:23.000
Done right, streetcars can drive huge increases in economic development.

08:23.340 --> 08:28.540
They're more of a symbol of modernization that entices residents, developers, and businesses

08:28.540 --> 08:29.540
to areas.

08:29.540 --> 08:36.100
Portland, for example, has had an estimated $5 billion in extra economic development thanks

08:36.100 --> 08:37.380
to its streetcar.

08:37.380 --> 08:41.940
New streetcar systems are being built all across the US in cities like Milwaukee and

08:41.940 --> 08:46.660
Oklahoma City since they're finally making money again—not from their fares, but from

08:46.660 --> 08:49.140
the jobs brought by their existence.

08:49.140 --> 08:53.480
People didn't want them a century ago, but streetcars finally make sense again.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.700
Public transportation is instrumentally important to the success of cities.

08:57.700 --> 09:02.100
You can almost be sure that a good city will have good public transportation and a bad

09:02.100 --> 09:04.940
city will have bad public transportation.

09:04.940 --> 09:10.280
Public transportation increases economic mobility, decreases carbon footprints, and increases

09:10.280 --> 09:16.100
economic development so the only question is, why not build more of it?

09:16.100 --> 09:20.060
One of the most common requests I receive is for a behind the scenes video and I've

09:20.060 --> 09:21.060
finally made one.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.020
I've partnered up with Skillshare to post it on their platform.

09:24.020 --> 09:28.380
The course is mainly geared to people who already do or want to create their own videos

09:28.380 --> 09:30.660
but it should be interesting for anyone.

09:30.660 --> 09:35.960
If you're not interested in that in particular, Skillshare has over 16,000 classes about pretty

09:35.960 --> 09:40.380
much anything and everything which you can watch from anywhere including when you're

09:40.380 --> 09:43.500
offline by using their iOS or Android apps.

09:43.500 --> 09:48.300
An annual membership gives you unlimited access to their classes for less than $10 a month

09:48.300 --> 09:54.800
but the first 500 people to sign up over at skl.sh slash wendover can learn whatever they

09:54.800 --> 09:59.140
want on Skillshare for free for their first two months including my behind the scenes

09:59.140 --> 10:01.780
course which is also linked in the description.
