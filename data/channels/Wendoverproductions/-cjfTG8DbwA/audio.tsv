10640	13560	This is Indiana and this is Scotland.
13560	18440	Both have a similar number of inhabitants, a similar size, and a similar population density.
18440	22960	But here's Indiana's public transportation system and here's Scotland's.
22960	27080	You want to get to Cooper, a town of 9,030 miles from the capital, that'll take you
27080	31520	55 minutes on a train that leaves every 30 minutes or an hour and 40 minutes on a bus
31520	33000	that leaves every 40.
33000	38200	You want to get to Anderson, a town of 50,000 30 miles from Indiana's capital, well you're
38200	39200	out of luck.
39200	40920	The only option is the car.
40920	46160	Antiquated technology, safety concerns, crumbling infrastructure, and non-existence, it's
46160	51160	not hard to argue that the US public transportation network is just not good.
51160	56320	Vast swaths of the US have no option but to drive because the alternative just is not
56320	57320	there.
57320	61520	This has consequences on the environment, on economic mobility, on where people live,
61520	67080	the consequences of America's lack of solid public transportation almost defines American
67080	68080	culture.
68080	69400	But it wasn't always like this.
69400	74460	The United States once had the best public transportation system in the world.
74460	79800	It was the admiration of countries worldwide and an essential factor allowing for the successful
79800	81940	western expansion of the country.
81940	84440	It all started with this—the horse car.
84440	88640	Now there were urban transportation systems before these horse drawn trams came along
88640	91600	but they weren't cheap and they weren't fast.
91600	95160	Roads generally weren't paved and there just wasn't the economic demand for high
95160	99620	frequency service because these carriages were rarely faster than walking.
99620	104200	But on rails, these horse cars were fast and one horse could pull a full load of passengers
104200	105680	thanks to the rails.
105680	110400	In its heyday, there were over 6,000 miles of horse car lines in the US.
110400	115520	In comparison, the combined mileage of every tram, subway, light rail, and commuter rail
115520	120120	system in the US nowadays is 5,416.
120120	123480	In 1880, 50 million people lived in the US.
123480	126600	Today, over 320 million.
126600	130480	Around the turn of the century, many of those horse car systems were electrified.
130480	134560	There were then 11,000 miles of street car track nationwide.
134560	136960	The systems were absolutely everywhere.
136960	141400	Even tiny towns like Bangor, Maine, and Berlin, New Hampshire had street cars.
141400	142500	So what happened?
142500	147600	How did the US go from having 11,000 miles of street car to 200?
147600	152160	How did the US go from having solid public transportation in towns big and small across
152160	154780	the country to how it is today?
154780	158520	The decline of the street car began just after the turn of the century.
158520	160520	That was when the automobile came around.
160520	165480	By 1920, the car was starting to get to an attainable price point for the everyday individual.
165480	170540	That was the real threat for the street car—not cars, but economical cars.
170540	175040	The street car received another blow in 1929—the Great Depression.
175040	178960	There were fewer people with jobs which meant fewer people who needed to commute and fewer
178960	184320	people who had the money to pay for transport so many lines were just not profitable anymore
184320	185560	and closed.
185560	189960	But then the street car received a stay of execution—World War II.
189960	195220	You see, during World War II, the US had the lowest unemployment rate in history—as low
195220	197140	as 1.2%.
197140	201560	There were tons of factory jobs to support the war so practically everyone who wanted
201560	203320	a job had a job.
203320	207260	That meant that there were tons more people now going to and from work and, even better
207260	211800	for the street car, there were rations going on on rubber and gas which diminished the
211800	213340	popularity of the car.
213340	217340	But something else was going on through all that—something more sinister.
217340	221860	Sometime in the 1920s, automobile technology became advanced enough that the bus became
221860	224000	cheaper to operate than the street car.
224000	228620	Street cars cost very little to power, but they do require a lot of infrastructure from
228620	230740	overhead lines to track.
230740	235720	Buses were more flexible and required almost no infrastructure and the bus had some powerful
235720	240460	friends—the automobile companies, or more specifically, General Motors.
240460	244720	General Motors went and bought dozens of small street car companies across the nation and
244720	246440	turned them into bus companies.
246440	251000	They removed hundreds of miles of track across the US and supported other companies doing
251000	254560	the same, but it's not like they didn't have a good reason to do this.
254560	257780	These street cars were not economically advantageous.
257780	262320	Buses were faster, cheaper, and at the time, they were the modern and fresh transportation
262320	264000	method that the public wanted.
264000	268300	Nearly every street car system nationwide was replaced with a bus system.
268300	272440	In addition, the street car companies were almost all commercial so if and when they
272440	277200	failed many local governments set up public, subsidized bus companies.
277200	281520	So that's how transportation got bad, but why did it stay bad?
281520	283480	Well, mostly because of the car.
283480	285920	America is the country of the car.
285920	289500	It grew up as the car grew up so its cities were built for cars.
289500	294760	Think Dallas, Phoenix, Los Angeles—you can't survive in these cities without a car.
294760	299000	Remember, the United States is centered around the idea of personal freedom.
299000	302060	With a car, you can go anywhere at any time.
302060	307120	So politically, cars have historically been associated with the idea of personal freedom.
307120	311520	Just like the Republican party votes to have strong national defense, allow gun ownership,
311520	315460	and preserve small government in order to promote personal freedom, they have always
315460	318540	worked to promote the usage and ownership of cars.
318540	323140	That means they often voted in favor of subsidies helping the auto industry, most often in the
323140	326880	form of indirect subsidies lowering the cost of gas.
326880	331500	Now that was fine when cities were small, highways were new, gas was cheap, and climate
331500	335160	change wasn't even a concept, but that's not the case anymore.
335160	340180	Cities are just of a size where they literally cannot support their entire population driving.
340180	346260	You can't fit more road infrastructure in many cities, but you can fit more public transportation.
346260	350760	Cars were available to the common American much earlier than the common European so the
350760	356680	US set road policies early that allowed for large, smooth, and well-functioning roads.
356680	361840	While the US was building its magnificent roads, Europe was building their public transportation
361840	362840	systems.
362840	366140	High car usage in the US even has to do with zoning.
366140	370940	You see, European cities tend to have less strict zoning laws which allow for businesses
370940	372940	and housing to intermingle.
372940	376020	The US zones its cities much more strictly.
376020	380120	Houses are next to houses and businesses are next to businesses which means that the distance
380120	383740	between houses and shops in the US is much greater.
383740	387100	Therefore, Americans have to go further more often.
387100	391260	The most demonstrative fact is how the two places approach parking.
391260	396080	In the US, zoning laws specify a minimum number of parking spaces per building.
396080	400480	In Europe, the laws specify a maximum number of parking spaces.
400480	404860	The three cities with the three lowest car ownership rates in the US all have something
404860	405860	in common.
405860	411940	Boston, New York, and DC are all old, rather compact cities with decent public transportation
411940	412940	systems.
412940	417400	Since they were cities before the car, they're built much more like the European cities that
417400	420480	have such good public transportation systems today.
420480	425520	simplified, public transportation gets worse as you go further west since western cities
425520	426520	are newer.
426520	430560	But here's the most important sentence of this entire video.
430560	435260	Access to transportation is the single most important factor in an individual's ability
435260	436760	to escape poverty.
436760	441900	That is not a subjective claim that is a fact that emerged from a Harvard study.
441900	446920	Someone who lives right by a subway stop is astronomically more likely to find a high-paying
446920	450540	job than someone who doesn't have a way to get around.
450540	455140	Individuals in poverty generally live in poor neighborhoods with few job opportunities,
455140	460020	but with reliable, accessible, and inexpensive public transportation, these individuals can
460020	463100	get all across their city to where the jobs are.
463100	468160	So, a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of a public transportation system is by how
468160	469900	well it serves the poor.
469900	472400	DC, for example, does a good job of this.
472400	476140	The poorest neighborhoods have the greatest proportion of their residents within a ten
476160	481460	minute walk of a metro station while the richest neighborhoods have the smallest proportion.
481460	486060	Hand in hand with their move back into the cities, millennials are shunning cars.
486060	491320	Car ownership among young people is at historic lows and the urban youth is relying more and
491320	493360	more on public transport.
493360	498480	Some cities like Portland, Kansas City, Detroit, and DC are turning back to streetcars.
498480	503000	Done right, streetcars can drive huge increases in economic development.
503340	508540	They're more of a symbol of modernization that entices residents, developers, and businesses
508540	509540	to areas.
509540	516100	Portland, for example, has had an estimated $5 billion in extra economic development thanks
516100	517380	to its streetcar.
517380	521940	New streetcar systems are being built all across the US in cities like Milwaukee and
521940	526660	Oklahoma City since they're finally making money again—not from their fares, but from
526660	529140	the jobs brought by their existence.
529140	533480	People didn't want them a century ago, but streetcars finally make sense again.
533480	537700	Public transportation is instrumentally important to the success of cities.
537700	542100	You can almost be sure that a good city will have good public transportation and a bad
542100	544940	city will have bad public transportation.
544940	550280	Public transportation increases economic mobility, decreases carbon footprints, and increases
550280	556100	economic development so the only question is, why not build more of it?
556100	560060	One of the most common requests I receive is for a behind the scenes video and I've
560060	561060	finally made one.
561060	564020	I've partnered up with Skillshare to post it on their platform.
564020	568380	The course is mainly geared to people who already do or want to create their own videos
568380	570660	but it should be interesting for anyone.
570660	575960	If you're not interested in that in particular, Skillshare has over 16,000 classes about pretty
575960	580380	much anything and everything which you can watch from anywhere including when you're
580380	583500	offline by using their iOS or Android apps.
583500	588300	An annual membership gives you unlimited access to their classes for less than $10 a month
588300	594800	but the first 500 people to sign up over at skl.sh slash wendover can learn whatever they
594800	599140	want on Skillshare for free for their first two months including my behind the scenes
599140	601780	course which is also linked in the description.
