00:08.980 --> 00:14.500
The Arctic will be perhaps the single most influential region on earth in the coming

00:14.500 --> 00:18.020
century and yet almost no one even lives there.

00:18.020 --> 00:22.140
Eight nations have territory above the Arctic Circle—Denmark through their constituent

00:22.140 --> 00:28.940
country Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States, and Canada—and

00:28.940 --> 00:31.740
they are all in close quarters.

00:31.740 --> 00:35.860
This circle represents the distance a plane can fly in three hours.

00:35.860 --> 00:40.340
Most of these countries can reach each other faster than they can watch Titanic.

00:40.340 --> 00:45.800
Anchorage, Alaska is, in fact, closer to Tromsø, Norway than it is to New York because of this

00:45.800 --> 00:47.580
shortcut over the pole.

00:47.580 --> 00:53.380
Alert, Canada is so close to Tromsø, Norway that it can be flown by a turboprop plane.

00:53.380 --> 00:58.140
The only issue is, there's about to be some serious money in the high north.

00:58.140 --> 01:01.460
The Arctic ice is melting—there's no question about that.

01:01.460 --> 01:05.300
Some may debate the cause of the melt, but one cannot debate that there's simply less

01:05.300 --> 01:07.900
ice up north than there was 50 years ago.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.740
This melt has profound consequences.

01:10.740 --> 01:15.020
Whole countries like Tuvalu and the Maldives could be largely underwater by the end of

01:15.020 --> 01:18.820
the century because of the rising sea levels from melting ice.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.580
But the melt has a different, more obvious effect.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.060
Where there was once ice, there's now liquid, navigable water.

01:25.060 --> 01:29.800
One of the greatest quests for early explorers was to find a northwest passage—a navigable

01:29.800 --> 01:34.460
sea route connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans through the Canadian archipelago.

01:34.460 --> 01:40.300
It was long thought to be a myth until, in 1906, Roald Amundsen and his six crew members

01:40.300 --> 01:45.340
arrived at Herschel Island, Canada having successfully completed a three-year journey

01:45.340 --> 01:49.020
from Norway via the new Northwest Passage.

01:49.020 --> 01:53.740
The significance of the Northwest Passage is that, until 1914 when the Panama Canal

01:53.740 --> 01:59.220
opened, traffic from the Atlantic could only reach the Pacific by sailing around Cape Horn,

01:59.220 --> 02:01.220
the southern tip of South America.

02:01.220 --> 02:05.460
This meant that a sea route between London and San Francisco, 5,000 miles apart as the

02:05.460 --> 02:08.940
crow flies, took 14,000 miles.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.480
This was not efficient.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.460
It was a significant hamper to development to the American west coast.

02:14.460 --> 02:19.300
The Northwest Passage would have revolutionized maritime trade, if it wasn't covered in

02:19.300 --> 02:20.300
ice.

02:20.340 --> 02:24.980
Roald Amundsen's ship, the Yoah, was small enough that it could snake through and slide

02:24.980 --> 02:26.120
over ice.

02:26.120 --> 02:31.220
Some of the waterways Amundsen took were as few as three feet deep—far too shallow for

02:31.220 --> 02:34.320
the increasingly large commercial ships of the time.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.560
More than a hundred years later, in September of 2013, however, for the very first time,

02:39.560 --> 02:46.420
a commercial bulk carrier, the MS Nordic Orion, transited an almost ice-free Northwest Passage

02:46.420 --> 02:49.980
on its journey from Vancouver, Canada to Pori, Finland.

02:49.980 --> 02:52.460
And this was far from a publicity stunt.

02:52.460 --> 03:00.140
This ship saved $80,000 in fuel costs and was able to take 25% more cargo than if it

03:00.140 --> 03:02.420
had gone through the Panama Canal.

03:02.420 --> 03:05.660
Even thousand passenger cruise ships are now making the journey.

03:05.660 --> 03:11.140
Ironically, global warming is actually opening a route that's better for the environment.

03:11.140 --> 03:15.900
China is a country with a vested interest in the navigability of the Northwest Passage.

03:15.900 --> 03:20.860
As an economy largely based on manufacturing for the western world, their maritime accessibility

03:20.860 --> 03:23.620
has an enormous effect on their national wellbeing.

03:23.620 --> 03:28.300
A reduction in time and cost of shipping to the American east coast would renew their

03:28.300 --> 03:33.300
competitiveness in the manufacturing industry against emerging rivals such as Vietnam and

03:33.300 --> 03:34.300
Bangladesh.

03:34.300 --> 03:38.460
As China industrialized largely thanks to its manufacturing industry, the standard of

03:38.460 --> 03:42.980
living in the country increased which correspondingly increased labor costs.

03:43.060 --> 03:48.020
China's Maritime Safety Administration, recognizing the imminent explosion in usage,

03:48.020 --> 03:54.380
recently published a 356 page guide to navigating the Northwest Passage and the country has

03:54.380 --> 03:59.180
announced plans to send more and more commercial shipping traffic through the passage in coming

03:59.180 --> 04:00.180
summers.

04:00.180 --> 04:04.100
The introduction of maritime traffic to the Northwest Passage could present a significant

04:04.100 --> 04:05.780
opportunity for Canada.

04:05.780 --> 04:10.220
The northern territories of Canada, through which the Northwest Passage runs, are historically

04:10.220 --> 04:11.700
underdeveloped.

04:11.700 --> 04:17.620
Less than 120,000 people live in the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.

04:17.620 --> 04:22.620
That's less than the population of Saguenay—a town small enough that there's a good chance

04:22.620 --> 04:27.180
that you haven't even heard of it—living in an area larger than the entire country

04:27.180 --> 04:28.180
of India.

04:28.180 --> 04:32.700
It's not all that surprising considering just how inhospitable the area is, but other

04:32.700 --> 04:38.140
places at similar latitudes such as Anchorage, Longyearbyen, and Murmansk have managed to

04:38.140 --> 04:42.740
overcome the conditions thanks to the money that can be made in the far north.

04:42.740 --> 04:46.580
If a large chunk of the world's maritime traffic heads through the Canadian north,

04:46.580 --> 04:52.380
industry will develop to support these ships… except, there's a problem.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.880
Despite the general friendliness of most of the Arctic countries, there are geopolitical

04:56.880 --> 04:58.820
issues in the high north.

04:58.820 --> 05:03.140
Even more surprisingly, one of them is between the US and Canada.

05:03.140 --> 05:07.540
When there's a navigation chokepoint restricting certain countries from accessing an ocean,

05:07.540 --> 05:11.620
it's convention to declare that waterway an international waterway.

05:11.620 --> 05:16.180
For example, the Danish straits, fully surrounded by Denmark, are an international waterway

05:16.180 --> 05:20.980
in order to give the Baltic and Scandinavian countries ocean access, the Turkish straits,

05:20.980 --> 05:24.700
fully surrounded by Turkey, are international waterways to give the Black Sea countries

05:24.700 --> 05:30.540
ocean access, and the Danube river is an international waterway to give landlock Austria, Hungary,

05:30.540 --> 05:33.820
Moldova, Serbia, and Slovakia ocean access.

05:33.820 --> 05:38.840
When a waterway is declared an international waterway, no country can restrict access or

05:38.840 --> 05:42.940
charge dues to passing boats except during a time of war.

05:42.940 --> 05:47.180
Canada considers the waterways comprising the Northwest Passage in their archipelago

05:47.180 --> 05:48.900
as their own waters.

05:48.900 --> 05:52.620
In the past, nobody challenged this since there was no reason anyone would cut through

05:52.620 --> 05:54.160
these frozen waters.

05:54.160 --> 05:58.200
With its promise to cut shipping routes by thousands of miles, the Northwest Passage

05:58.200 --> 06:02.320
will almost certainly become an important shipping route so that's why countries like

06:02.320 --> 06:07.880
the US firmly believe that the Northwest Passage should be and already is an international

06:07.880 --> 06:08.880
waterway.

06:08.880 --> 06:14.760
One of the tensest moments in history between the US and Canada was when, in 1985, a US

06:14.760 --> 06:18.960
Coast Guard icebreaker travelled through the Northwest Passage without prior permission

06:18.960 --> 06:19.960
from Canada.

06:19.960 --> 06:25.680
In Canada's mind, this was a military invasion of their sovereign territory—debatedly an

06:25.680 --> 06:26.960
act of war.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.440
Canada argues that the Northwest Passage is not an international waterway because it has

06:31.440 --> 06:35.040
failed to meet an important criteria—usefulness.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.920
Of course the Northwest Passage is useful on paper—it shortens the route between the

06:38.920 --> 06:43.480
oceans—but Canada has pointed out that in previous cases determining whether a waterway

06:43.480 --> 06:48.560
is international, what proves a route's usefulness is if a significant number of ships

06:48.560 --> 06:51.040
have already successfully transited it.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.980
In the Northwest Passage's case, the number of successful commercial journeys is in the

06:54.980 --> 06:55.980
double digits.

06:55.980 --> 06:59.840
There's also merit to Canada's argument that the passage should be their sovereign

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
waters.

07:00.880 --> 07:05.480
Unfortunately, Canada has almost no search and rescue capabilities in their archipelago.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.680
Since there's almost no traffic yet, there's no reason to spend the money to put ships

07:09.680 --> 07:11.240
and aircraft up there.

07:11.240 --> 07:16.520
Most previous journeys have been highly coordinated and often escorted by the Canadian Coast Guard.

07:16.520 --> 07:21.000
If a ship just went through with no prior coordination nowadays and sank, however, there

07:21.000 --> 07:24.600
would be almost no chance of rescue for the victims.

07:24.600 --> 07:29.360
If in a few summers hundreds of ships transit the passage, Canada would have an obligation

07:29.360 --> 07:34.800
to put resources in the northern provinces for the safety of both the country and sailors

07:34.800 --> 07:37.000
and that takes money.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.520
If treated as an internal waterway, Canada could charge passage fees just as there are

07:41.520 --> 07:46.200
for the Panama or Suez Canal—the other major shipping shortcuts of the world.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.760
These could fund the infrastructure needed to safely regulate and police the route, but

07:50.760 --> 07:54.560
on the other hand, should one country have the capability to choose who can get from

07:54.560 --> 07:58.820
the Atlantic to the Pacific faster, letting for example Vietnamese ships through the route

07:58.820 --> 08:03.820
but banning Chinese ships would make the Chinese goods uncompetitive for the western European

08:03.820 --> 08:05.980
and eastern American market.

08:05.980 --> 08:10.540
Canada would have the capability to choose which economies can succeed and which will

08:10.540 --> 08:11.540
fail.

08:11.540 --> 08:14.180
There's a reason the issue is so contentious.

08:14.180 --> 08:18.180
Scientists disagree on the exact date, but there's a general consensus that by the

08:18.180 --> 08:22.840
year 2050 there will be a summer when there is no ice in the arctic.

08:22.840 --> 08:28.800
This will have enormous and irreversible consequences but it could further revolutionize how it

08:28.800 --> 08:30.160
we get our goods.

08:30.160 --> 08:35.360
An ice-free arctic will open up the greatest shipping shortcut in the world—the arctic

08:35.360 --> 08:36.580
ocean.

08:36.580 --> 08:40.800
Ships traveling between Japan and western Europe, for example, instead of heading south

08:40.800 --> 08:45.080
across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal, and across the Mediterranean Sea, will

08:45.080 --> 08:49.960
be able to head north through the Bering Strait, directly across the arctic ocean, and down

08:49.960 --> 08:52.080
between Greenland and Norway to Europe.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.360
That's a 7,000 mile route compared to the 13,000 mile route of today.

08:57.360 --> 09:02.120
That has the potential to slash shipping prices in half—that means cheaper products

09:02.120 --> 09:03.760
across the entire world.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.660
But at what cost?

09:05.660 --> 09:11.660
Every degree of climate warming in the US alone is expected to cost $144 billion dollars

09:11.660 --> 09:13.640
per year of economic loss.

09:13.640 --> 09:20.000
If the US climate warms by 12 degrees, which the EPA says is possible by 2100, the US can

09:20.000 --> 09:25.500
expect to lose more than $1.7 trillion dollars per year—that's more than a full percent

09:25.500 --> 09:26.700
of its GDP.

09:26.700 --> 09:33.260
On top of that, by 2050, climate change is expected to cause more than 250,000 deaths

09:33.260 --> 09:34.260
per year.

09:34.260 --> 09:39.580
Surely that can't be worth it for some cheaper goods.

09:39.580 --> 09:41.820
This video was made possible by Hover.

09:41.820 --> 09:47.940
I recently bought two new domains with Hover—the website for my new podcast, Showmakers.fm,

09:47.940 --> 09:52.620
and an extra domain for my Wendover Productions site, Wendover.Productions.

09:52.620 --> 09:58.200
With Showmakers.fm I connected it to a hosting provider in seconds and with Wendover.Productions

09:58.200 --> 10:01.140
I set it to redirect to my site in seconds.

10:01.140 --> 10:02.580
It was incredibly easy.

10:02.580 --> 10:07.020
I also love how the price they show you is the price you pay—there aren't page after

10:07.020 --> 10:09.540
page of add-ons like with some other sites.

10:09.540 --> 10:14.460
Now, having a professional web presence is important and it all starts with the domain.

10:14.460 --> 10:18.640
What can really set you apart is a unique domain extension—that's the bit at the

10:18.640 --> 10:25.000
end like .com, .fm, or even .pizza—and Hover has over 400 of them.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.560
Once you buy a domain through Hover you can set up an email account using that domain

10:29.560 --> 10:31.920
which will truly help you stand out.

10:31.920 --> 10:36.600
