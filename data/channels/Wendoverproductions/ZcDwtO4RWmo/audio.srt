3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,500
The Arctic will be perhaps the single most influential region on earth in the coming

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,020
century and yet almost no one even lives there.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,140
Eight nations have territory above the Arctic Circle—Denmark through their constituent

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,940
country Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States, and Canada—and

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,740
they are all in close quarters.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,860
This circle represents the distance a plane can fly in three hours.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,340
Most of these countries can reach each other faster than they can watch Titanic.

10
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,800
Anchorage, Alaska is, in fact, closer to Tromsø, Norway than it is to New York because of this

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,580
shortcut over the pole.

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:53,380
Alert, Canada is so close to Tromsø, Norway that it can be flown by a turboprop plane.

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,140
The only issue is, there's about to be some serious money in the high north.

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,460
The Arctic ice is melting—there's no question about that.

15
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,300
Some may debate the cause of the melt, but one cannot debate that there's simply less

16
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,900
ice up north than there was 50 years ago.

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,740
This melt has profound consequences.

18
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,020
Whole countries like Tuvalu and the Maldives could be largely underwater by the end of

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,820
the century because of the rising sea levels from melting ice.

20
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,580
But the melt has a different, more obvious effect.

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,060
Where there was once ice, there's now liquid, navigable water.

22
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,800
One of the greatest quests for early explorers was to find a northwest passage—a navigable

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,460
sea route connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans through the Canadian archipelago.

24
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:40,300
It was long thought to be a myth until, in 1906, Roald Amundsen and his six crew members

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,340
arrived at Herschel Island, Canada having successfully completed a three-year journey

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,020
from Norway via the new Northwest Passage.

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,740
The significance of the Northwest Passage is that, until 1914 when the Panama Canal

28
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,220
opened, traffic from the Atlantic could only reach the Pacific by sailing around Cape Horn,

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,220
the southern tip of South America.

30
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:05,460
This meant that a sea route between London and San Francisco, 5,000 miles apart as the

31
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,940
crow flies, took 14,000 miles.

32
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,480
This was not efficient.

33
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,460
It was a significant hamper to development to the American west coast.

34
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,300
The Northwest Passage would have revolutionized maritime trade, if it wasn't covered in

35
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
ice.

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,980
Roald Amundsen's ship, the Yoah, was small enough that it could snake through and slide

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,120
over ice.

38
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,220
Some of the waterways Amundsen took were as few as three feet deep—far too shallow for

39
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,320
the increasingly large commercial ships of the time.

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,560
More than a hundred years later, in September of 2013, however, for the very first time,

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,420
a commercial bulk carrier, the MS Nordic Orion, transited an almost ice-free Northwest Passage

42
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,980
on its journey from Vancouver, Canada to Pori, Finland.

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,460
And this was far from a publicity stunt.

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:00,140
This ship saved $80,000 in fuel costs and was able to take 25% more cargo than if it

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,420
had gone through the Panama Canal.

46
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,660
Even thousand passenger cruise ships are now making the journey.

47
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,140
Ironically, global warming is actually opening a route that's better for the environment.

48
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,900
China is a country with a vested interest in the navigability of the Northwest Passage.

49
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,860
As an economy largely based on manufacturing for the western world, their maritime accessibility

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,620
has an enormous effect on their national wellbeing.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,300
A reduction in time and cost of shipping to the American east coast would renew their

52
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
competitiveness in the manufacturing industry against emerging rivals such as Vietnam and

53
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Bangladesh.

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,460
As China industrialized largely thanks to its manufacturing industry, the standard of

55
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,980
living in the country increased which correspondingly increased labor costs.

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,020
China's Maritime Safety Administration, recognizing the imminent explosion in usage,

57
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,380
recently published a 356 page guide to navigating the Northwest Passage and the country has

58
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,180
announced plans to send more and more commercial shipping traffic through the passage in coming

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
summers.

60
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,100
The introduction of maritime traffic to the Northwest Passage could present a significant

61
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,780
opportunity for Canada.

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,220
The northern territories of Canada, through which the Northwest Passage runs, are historically

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,700
underdeveloped.

64
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,620
Less than 120,000 people live in the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.

65
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,620
That's less than the population of Saguenay—a town small enough that there's a good chance

66
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,180
that you haven't even heard of it—living in an area larger than the entire country

67
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,180
of India.

68
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,700
It's not all that surprising considering just how inhospitable the area is, but other

69
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:38,140
places at similar latitudes such as Anchorage, Longyearbyen, and Murmansk have managed to

70
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,740
overcome the conditions thanks to the money that can be made in the far north.

71
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,580
If a large chunk of the world's maritime traffic heads through the Canadian north,

72
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:52,380
industry will develop to support these ships… except, there's a problem.

73
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,880
Despite the general friendliness of most of the Arctic countries, there are geopolitical

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,820
issues in the high north.

75
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,140
Even more surprisingly, one of them is between the US and Canada.

76
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,540
When there's a navigation chokepoint restricting certain countries from accessing an ocean,

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,620
it's convention to declare that waterway an international waterway.

78
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,180
For example, the Danish straits, fully surrounded by Denmark, are an international waterway

79
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,980
in order to give the Baltic and Scandinavian countries ocean access, the Turkish straits,

80
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,700
fully surrounded by Turkey, are international waterways to give the Black Sea countries

81
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,540
ocean access, and the Danube river is an international waterway to give landlock Austria, Hungary,

82
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,820
Moldova, Serbia, and Slovakia ocean access.

83
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,840
When a waterway is declared an international waterway, no country can restrict access or

84
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,940
charge dues to passing boats except during a time of war.

85
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,180
Canada considers the waterways comprising the Northwest Passage in their archipelago

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,900
as their own waters.

87
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,620
In the past, nobody challenged this since there was no reason anyone would cut through

88
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,160
these frozen waters.

89
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,200
With its promise to cut shipping routes by thousands of miles, the Northwest Passage

90
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,320
will almost certainly become an important shipping route so that's why countries like

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:07,880
the US firmly believe that the Northwest Passage should be and already is an international

92
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,880
waterway.

93
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,760
One of the tensest moments in history between the US and Canada was when, in 1985, a US

94
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,960
Coast Guard icebreaker travelled through the Northwest Passage without prior permission

95
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,960
from Canada.

96
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,680
In Canada's mind, this was a military invasion of their sovereign territory—debatedly an

97
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,960
act of war.

98
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Canada argues that the Northwest Passage is not an international waterway because it has

99
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,040
failed to meet an important criteria—usefulness.

100
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,920
Of course the Northwest Passage is useful on paper—it shortens the route between the

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,480
oceans—but Canada has pointed out that in previous cases determining whether a waterway

102
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,560
is international, what proves a route's usefulness is if a significant number of ships

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,040
have already successfully transited it.

104
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,980
In the Northwest Passage's case, the number of successful commercial journeys is in the

105
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
double digits.

106
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,840
There's also merit to Canada's argument that the passage should be their sovereign

107
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
waters.

108
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,480
Unfortunately, Canada has almost no search and rescue capabilities in their archipelago.

109
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,680
Since there's almost no traffic yet, there's no reason to spend the money to put ships

110
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,240
and aircraft up there.

111
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,520
Most previous journeys have been highly coordinated and often escorted by the Canadian Coast Guard.

112
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,000
If a ship just went through with no prior coordination nowadays and sank, however, there

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
would be almost no chance of rescue for the victims.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,360
If in a few summers hundreds of ships transit the passage, Canada would have an obligation

115
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,800
to put resources in the northern provinces for the safety of both the country and sailors

116
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,000
and that takes money.

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,520
If treated as an internal waterway, Canada could charge passage fees just as there are

118
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,200
for the Panama or Suez Canal—the other major shipping shortcuts of the world.

119
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,760
These could fund the infrastructure needed to safely regulate and police the route, but

120
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,560
on the other hand, should one country have the capability to choose who can get from

121
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,820
the Atlantic to the Pacific faster, letting for example Vietnamese ships through the route

122
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,820
but banning Chinese ships would make the Chinese goods uncompetitive for the western European

123
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,980
and eastern American market.

124
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,540
Canada would have the capability to choose which economies can succeed and which will

125
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
fail.

126
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,180
There's a reason the issue is so contentious.

127
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,180
Scientists disagree on the exact date, but there's a general consensus that by the

128
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:22,840
year 2050 there will be a summer when there is no ice in the arctic.

129
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,800
This will have enormous and irreversible consequences but it could further revolutionize how it

130
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
we get our goods.

131
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,360
An ice-free arctic will open up the greatest shipping shortcut in the world—the arctic

132
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,580
ocean.

133
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,800
Ships traveling between Japan and western Europe, for example, instead of heading south

134
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,080
across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal, and across the Mediterranean Sea, will

135
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,960
be able to head north through the Bering Strait, directly across the arctic ocean, and down

136
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,080
between Greenland and Norway to Europe.

137
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,360
That's a 7,000 mile route compared to the 13,000 mile route of today.

138
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,120
That has the potential to slash shipping prices in half—that means cheaper products

139
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,760
across the entire world.

140
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,660
But at what cost?

141
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:11,660
Every degree of climate warming in the US alone is expected to cost $144 billion dollars

142
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,640
per year of economic loss.

143
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,000
If the US climate warms by 12 degrees, which the EPA says is possible by 2100, the US can

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,500
expect to lose more than $1.7 trillion dollars per year—that's more than a full percent

145
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,700
of its GDP.

146
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:33,260
On top of that, by 2050, climate change is expected to cause more than 250,000 deaths

147
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
per year.

148
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,580
Surely that can't be worth it for some cheaper goods.

149
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,820
This video was made possible by Hover.

150
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,940
I recently bought two new domains with Hover—the website for my new podcast, Showmakers.fm,

151
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,620
and an extra domain for my Wendover Productions site, Wendover.Productions.

152
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:58,200
With Showmakers.fm I connected it to a hosting provider in seconds and with Wendover.Productions

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,140
I set it to redirect to my site in seconds.

154
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,580
It was incredibly easy.

155
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,020
I also love how the price they show you is the price you pay—there aren't page after

156
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,540
page of add-ons like with some other sites.

157
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,460
Now, having a professional web presence is important and it all starts with the domain.

158
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,640
What can really set you apart is a unique domain extension—that's the bit at the

159
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:25,000
end like .com, .fm, or even .pizza—and Hover has over 400 of them.

160
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,560
Once you buy a domain through Hover you can set up an email account using that domain

161
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,920
which will truly help you stand out.

162
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,600
However you want to use Hover, you can get 10% off your first order and help out Wendover
