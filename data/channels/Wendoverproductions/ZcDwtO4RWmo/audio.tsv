8980	14500	The Arctic will be perhaps the single most influential region on earth in the coming
14500	18020	century and yet almost no one even lives there.
18020	22140	Eight nations have territory above the Arctic Circle—Denmark through their constituent
22140	28940	country Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, the United States, and Canada—and
28940	31740	they are all in close quarters.
31740	35860	This circle represents the distance a plane can fly in three hours.
35860	40340	Most of these countries can reach each other faster than they can watch Titanic.
40340	45800	Anchorage, Alaska is, in fact, closer to Tromsø, Norway than it is to New York because of this
45800	47580	shortcut over the pole.
47580	53380	Alert, Canada is so close to Tromsø, Norway that it can be flown by a turboprop plane.
53380	58140	The only issue is, there's about to be some serious money in the high north.
58140	61460	The Arctic ice is melting—there's no question about that.
61460	65300	Some may debate the cause of the melt, but one cannot debate that there's simply less
65300	67900	ice up north than there was 50 years ago.
67900	70740	This melt has profound consequences.
70740	75020	Whole countries like Tuvalu and the Maldives could be largely underwater by the end of
75020	78820	the century because of the rising sea levels from melting ice.
78820	81580	But the melt has a different, more obvious effect.
81580	85060	Where there was once ice, there's now liquid, navigable water.
85060	89800	One of the greatest quests for early explorers was to find a northwest passage—a navigable
89800	94460	sea route connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans through the Canadian archipelago.
94460	100300	It was long thought to be a myth until, in 1906, Roald Amundsen and his six crew members
100300	105340	arrived at Herschel Island, Canada having successfully completed a three-year journey
105340	109020	from Norway via the new Northwest Passage.
109020	113740	The significance of the Northwest Passage is that, until 1914 when the Panama Canal
113740	119220	opened, traffic from the Atlantic could only reach the Pacific by sailing around Cape Horn,
119220	121220	the southern tip of South America.
121220	125460	This meant that a sea route between London and San Francisco, 5,000 miles apart as the
125460	128940	crow flies, took 14,000 miles.
128940	130480	This was not efficient.
130480	134460	It was a significant hamper to development to the American west coast.
134460	139300	The Northwest Passage would have revolutionized maritime trade, if it wasn't covered in
139300	140300	ice.
140340	144980	Roald Amundsen's ship, the Yoah, was small enough that it could snake through and slide
144980	146120	over ice.
146120	151220	Some of the waterways Amundsen took were as few as three feet deep—far too shallow for
151220	154320	the increasingly large commercial ships of the time.
154320	159560	More than a hundred years later, in September of 2013, however, for the very first time,
159560	166420	a commercial bulk carrier, the MS Nordic Orion, transited an almost ice-free Northwest Passage
166420	169980	on its journey from Vancouver, Canada to Pori, Finland.
169980	172460	And this was far from a publicity stunt.
172460	180140	This ship saved $80,000 in fuel costs and was able to take 25% more cargo than if it
180140	182420	had gone through the Panama Canal.
182420	185660	Even thousand passenger cruise ships are now making the journey.
185660	191140	Ironically, global warming is actually opening a route that's better for the environment.
191140	195900	China is a country with a vested interest in the navigability of the Northwest Passage.
195900	200860	As an economy largely based on manufacturing for the western world, their maritime accessibility
200860	203620	has an enormous effect on their national wellbeing.
203620	208300	A reduction in time and cost of shipping to the American east coast would renew their
208300	213300	competitiveness in the manufacturing industry against emerging rivals such as Vietnam and
213300	214300	Bangladesh.
214300	218460	As China industrialized largely thanks to its manufacturing industry, the standard of
218460	222980	living in the country increased which correspondingly increased labor costs.
223060	228020	China's Maritime Safety Administration, recognizing the imminent explosion in usage,
228020	234380	recently published a 356 page guide to navigating the Northwest Passage and the country has
234380	239180	announced plans to send more and more commercial shipping traffic through the passage in coming
239180	240180	summers.
240180	244100	The introduction of maritime traffic to the Northwest Passage could present a significant
244100	245780	opportunity for Canada.
245780	250220	The northern territories of Canada, through which the Northwest Passage runs, are historically
250220	251700	underdeveloped.
251700	257620	Less than 120,000 people live in the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut.
257620	262620	That's less than the population of Saguenay—a town small enough that there's a good chance
262620	267180	that you haven't even heard of it—living in an area larger than the entire country
267180	268180	of India.
268180	272700	It's not all that surprising considering just how inhospitable the area is, but other
272700	278140	places at similar latitudes such as Anchorage, Longyearbyen, and Murmansk have managed to
278140	282740	overcome the conditions thanks to the money that can be made in the far north.
282740	286580	If a large chunk of the world's maritime traffic heads through the Canadian north,
286580	292380	industry will develop to support these ships… except, there's a problem.
292380	296880	Despite the general friendliness of most of the Arctic countries, there are geopolitical
296880	298820	issues in the high north.
298820	303140	Even more surprisingly, one of them is between the US and Canada.
303140	307540	When there's a navigation chokepoint restricting certain countries from accessing an ocean,
307540	311620	it's convention to declare that waterway an international waterway.
311620	316180	For example, the Danish straits, fully surrounded by Denmark, are an international waterway
316180	320980	in order to give the Baltic and Scandinavian countries ocean access, the Turkish straits,
320980	324700	fully surrounded by Turkey, are international waterways to give the Black Sea countries
324700	330540	ocean access, and the Danube river is an international waterway to give landlock Austria, Hungary,
330540	333820	Moldova, Serbia, and Slovakia ocean access.
333820	338840	When a waterway is declared an international waterway, no country can restrict access or
338840	342940	charge dues to passing boats except during a time of war.
342940	347180	Canada considers the waterways comprising the Northwest Passage in their archipelago
347180	348900	as their own waters.
348900	352620	In the past, nobody challenged this since there was no reason anyone would cut through
352620	354160	these frozen waters.
354160	358200	With its promise to cut shipping routes by thousands of miles, the Northwest Passage
358200	362320	will almost certainly become an important shipping route so that's why countries like
362320	367880	the US firmly believe that the Northwest Passage should be and already is an international
367880	368880	waterway.
368880	374760	One of the tensest moments in history between the US and Canada was when, in 1985, a US
374760	378960	Coast Guard icebreaker travelled through the Northwest Passage without prior permission
378960	379960	from Canada.
379960	385680	In Canada's mind, this was a military invasion of their sovereign territory—debatedly an
385680	386960	act of war.
386960	391440	Canada argues that the Northwest Passage is not an international waterway because it has
391440	395040	failed to meet an important criteria—usefulness.
395040	398920	Of course the Northwest Passage is useful on paper—it shortens the route between the
398920	403480	oceans—but Canada has pointed out that in previous cases determining whether a waterway
403480	408560	is international, what proves a route's usefulness is if a significant number of ships
408560	411040	have already successfully transited it.
411040	414980	In the Northwest Passage's case, the number of successful commercial journeys is in the
414980	415980	double digits.
415980	419840	There's also merit to Canada's argument that the passage should be their sovereign
419840	420840	waters.
420880	425480	Unfortunately, Canada has almost no search and rescue capabilities in their archipelago.
425480	429680	Since there's almost no traffic yet, there's no reason to spend the money to put ships
429680	431240	and aircraft up there.
431240	436520	Most previous journeys have been highly coordinated and often escorted by the Canadian Coast Guard.
436520	441000	If a ship just went through with no prior coordination nowadays and sank, however, there
441000	444600	would be almost no chance of rescue for the victims.
444600	449360	If in a few summers hundreds of ships transit the passage, Canada would have an obligation
449360	454800	to put resources in the northern provinces for the safety of both the country and sailors
454800	457000	and that takes money.
457000	461520	If treated as an internal waterway, Canada could charge passage fees just as there are
461520	466200	for the Panama or Suez Canal—the other major shipping shortcuts of the world.
466200	470760	These could fund the infrastructure needed to safely regulate and police the route, but
470760	474560	on the other hand, should one country have the capability to choose who can get from
474560	478820	the Atlantic to the Pacific faster, letting for example Vietnamese ships through the route
478820	483820	but banning Chinese ships would make the Chinese goods uncompetitive for the western European
483820	485980	and eastern American market.
485980	490540	Canada would have the capability to choose which economies can succeed and which will
490540	491540	fail.
491540	494180	There's a reason the issue is so contentious.
494180	498180	Scientists disagree on the exact date, but there's a general consensus that by the
498180	502840	year 2050 there will be a summer when there is no ice in the arctic.
502840	508800	This will have enormous and irreversible consequences but it could further revolutionize how it
508800	510160	we get our goods.
510160	515360	An ice-free arctic will open up the greatest shipping shortcut in the world—the arctic
515360	516580	ocean.
516580	520800	Ships traveling between Japan and western Europe, for example, instead of heading south
520800	525080	across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal, and across the Mediterranean Sea, will
525080	529960	be able to head north through the Bering Strait, directly across the arctic ocean, and down
529960	532080	between Greenland and Norway to Europe.
532080	537360	That's a 7,000 mile route compared to the 13,000 mile route of today.
537360	542120	That has the potential to slash shipping prices in half—that means cheaper products
542120	543760	across the entire world.
543760	545660	But at what cost?
545660	551660	Every degree of climate warming in the US alone is expected to cost $144 billion dollars
551660	553640	per year of economic loss.
553640	560000	If the US climate warms by 12 degrees, which the EPA says is possible by 2100, the US can
560000	565500	expect to lose more than $1.7 trillion dollars per year—that's more than a full percent
565500	566700	of its GDP.
566700	573260	On top of that, by 2050, climate change is expected to cause more than 250,000 deaths
573260	574260	per year.
574260	579580	Surely that can't be worth it for some cheaper goods.
