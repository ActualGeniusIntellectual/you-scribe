00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
It all happened so quickly.

00:02.920 --> 00:10.620
On February 24th, 2022, just after 2 AM Ukraine time, Vladimir Putin, the autocrat of Russia,

00:10.620 --> 00:23.040
announced in a pre-recorded TV address a quote, special military operation in Ukraine.

00:23.040 --> 00:26.400
To the rest of the world, that meant war.

00:26.400 --> 00:31.020
Within minutes, the shelling started, the skies lit up, and the Russian invasion of

00:31.020 --> 00:46.080
Ukraine had begun.

00:46.080 --> 00:51.760
To many Ukrainians, though, this was perceived not as a beginning, but a continuation—a

00:51.760 --> 00:56.880
continuation of the conflict that began some eight years prior in the spring of 2014.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.600
Ever since Russia and the rebels it backed overtook Crimea and swaths of eastern Ukraine,

01:01.600 --> 01:06.200
the country has maintained an enlarged and active military presence along Ukraine's

01:06.200 --> 01:07.200
borders.

01:07.200 --> 01:12.540
In 2017, for example, Russia re-established the famed but disbanded 8th Combined Arms

01:12.540 --> 01:15.160
Army here, in Novichirkassk.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.880
Revived under the pretense that it was a defensive decision, the 8th Combined Army has since

01:19.880 --> 01:25.040
grown, adding artillery, missile subunits, and even, some analysts believe, incorporating

01:25.040 --> 01:28.200
separatists into its own ranks.

01:28.200 --> 01:31.500
This is hardly an isolated development.

01:31.500 --> 01:36.680
From Sevastopol on the southern tip of Crimea, to Klincy along Ukraine's northern border,

01:36.680 --> 01:42.060
Russian bases, staging points, and general military infrastructure have grown to increasingly

01:42.060 --> 01:45.000
surround Ukraine since 2014.

01:45.000 --> 01:49.600
This extension of military might was made possible by the physical seizure of the land,

01:49.600 --> 01:54.360
and, in the eyes of Russian leadership, justified by the threat the Ukraine could retaliate

01:54.360 --> 01:57.400
or try to seize back occupied territories.

01:57.400 --> 02:03.160
This extension has also, in turn, quite literally paved the path for Russia to amass an extraordinary

02:03.160 --> 02:09.000
75% of their principal combat units within striking distance of Ukraine.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.840
On Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry announced that 90,000 Russian

02:14.840 --> 02:18.400
troops had encircled the country's borders and occupied territories.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.700
The Russian forces that were in the region for supposed exercises simply weren't leaving.

02:23.700 --> 02:28.840
Not only were they not going away, but, as the next few months would reveal, their numbers

02:28.840 --> 02:30.640
were growing.

02:30.640 --> 02:35.680
This is a satellite image from outside the western Russian town of Jena in September,

02:35.680 --> 02:39.520
and this is the exact same spot on November 1st.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.820
From an empty field and a dirt road, to the staging area for the Russian 41st Combined

02:43.820 --> 02:49.740
Army, normally headquartered some 2,000 miles or 3,000 kilometers away, suddenly sat north

02:49.740 --> 02:55.180
of 1,200 tanks, howitzers, towed artillery, and support vehicles.

02:55.180 --> 02:58.900
And November only marked the beginning.

02:58.900 --> 03:03.240
Satellite images and social media posts tracked soldiers and supplies pouring into southwest

03:03.240 --> 03:08.960
Russia across December, but what alarmed analysts most was the fact that along with the soldiers

03:08.960 --> 03:13.920
and supplies, there were medical units, hospital tents, and fuel reserves.

03:13.920 --> 03:18.160
The Russians were amassing the infrastructure for war.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.940
The likelihood that this was a simulation plummeted.

03:21.940 --> 03:26.800
In January, Russian forces rolled into Belarus for joint exercises.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.200
Weeks later, it was announced that the soldiers would stay.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.420
Established staging areas like Jena further expanded, while new ones popped up, forming

03:35.420 --> 03:38.940
an increasingly foreboding arc around Ukraine.

03:38.940 --> 03:44.580
Now, behind the scenes, what made this massive domestic mobilization of troops, weapons,

03:44.580 --> 03:49.080
and supplies possible was Russia's vast rail network.

03:49.080 --> 03:52.980
This rail network's extent, earning its status as the third largest in the world,

03:52.980 --> 03:58.260
is a byproduct of the country's size, sparsity, and the suspect nature of its road network.

03:58.260 --> 04:02.940
Meanwhile, the degree of state control, with a government owning some 20 of the country's

04:02.940 --> 04:06.500
10,000 locomotives, is a legacy of the Soviet era.

04:06.500 --> 04:11.720
This control and extensiveness combined means that Russia's military is able to rely heavily

04:11.720 --> 04:13.160
on the rail network.

04:13.160 --> 04:18.140
It was trains that moved the troops, tanks, and trucks to and from Jena, into Kursk, and

04:18.140 --> 04:21.260
across the Bryansk and Smolensk oblasts.

04:21.260 --> 04:25.260
Digital forensics have shown that it was also trains that moved supplies from eastern Russia

04:25.260 --> 04:30.260
all the way to Belarus, and it was largely thanks to these trains, or Russia's reliance

04:30.260 --> 04:35.480
on them, that outsiders were able to so precisely document the military buildup as dashcams

04:35.480 --> 04:40.740
filmed transiting tanks at rail crossings—videos which then ended up on TikTok and circulated

04:40.740 --> 04:42.900
the world over.

04:42.900 --> 04:45.860
Trains set the stage.

04:45.860 --> 04:52.420
In the first weeks of February, under a curtain of clouds, Jena emptied out, its troops and

04:52.420 --> 04:55.340
supplies tracked south.

04:55.340 --> 04:59.860
As these Russian forces pushed ever nearer to the Ukrainian border, tanks appeared in

04:59.860 --> 05:05.780
Kursk, just a 140 mile or 220 kilometer drive from Kharkiv, while additional troops and

05:05.780 --> 05:11.940
trucks amassed near Gomel, Belarus—20 miles or 32 kilometers away from the border.

05:11.940 --> 05:18.740
Across three and a half months, 175,000 Russian troops had stacked up all along Ukraine's

05:18.740 --> 05:23.900
border, ready to unleash death and destruction in the country they believed they were there

05:23.900 --> 05:33.100
to liberate.

05:33.100 --> 05:37.960
In the opening hours of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the invading force worked to cripple

05:37.960 --> 05:41.180
Ukraine's military infrastructure.

05:41.180 --> 05:45.620
Some of the first volleys of the conflict involved air strikes on Ukrainian air bases,

05:45.620 --> 05:50.580
in an effort to help Russia quickly gain air superiority without strong resistance.

05:50.580 --> 05:54.560
Eleven were destroyed across the first day of hostilities.

05:54.560 --> 06:00.180
By noon, focus shifted from anticipatory defense to offense as dozens of Russian helicopters

06:00.180 --> 06:04.780
landed troops at Hostomel airport mere miles from Kiev.

06:04.780 --> 06:09.060
This was seemingly in an effort to create an air bridge—seizing control of the airport

06:09.060 --> 06:13.300
to allow planes to bring in more troops who would push out into Kiev.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.860
An air-based supplying line could assure a certain level of logistical support regardless

06:17.860 --> 06:20.980
of conditions on the ground between the border and Kiev.

06:20.980 --> 06:26.060
However, also recognizing this, Ukraine tasked its fourth Rapid Reaction Brigade to retake

06:26.060 --> 06:29.740
the airport, which it successfully did by 8 PM.

06:29.740 --> 06:33.560
Across the same day, as fighting reached the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and troops poured

06:33.560 --> 06:39.200
in from every direction, work continued behind the front lines to support the continued invasion.

06:39.200 --> 06:43.740
In Brest, Belarus, Russian forces could be seen unloading supplies from railcars and assembling

06:43.740 --> 06:47.600
into a convoy configuration, facing south, towards the war zone.

06:47.600 --> 06:52.060
In Koniki, near Belarus' closest point to Kiev, satellite imagery captured a road

06:52.060 --> 06:57.200
that Russians converted into a helicopter base, with an X marking each landing zone.

06:57.200 --> 07:02.400
To the east, in Russia itself, a field hospital could be seen ready to treat early casualties,

07:02.400 --> 07:06.560
while nearby, another makeshift facility home to artillery and rocket launchers used in

07:06.560 --> 07:09.760
the opening hours of the conflict stood ready for more.

07:09.760 --> 07:14.720
However, despite all the well-planned war infrastructure constructed around Ukraine,

07:14.720 --> 07:19.680
things inside the war zone were seemingly going less to plan.

07:19.680 --> 07:24.260
As the sun rose from a bloody night onto the second day of battle, Russian forces set their

07:24.260 --> 07:29.960
sights on Kiev—the country's capital, home to its government and lauded leader Volodymyr

07:29.960 --> 07:31.500
Zelensky.

07:31.500 --> 07:35.720
Under the assumption that Russia's ultimate ambition was to install a puppet government,

07:35.720 --> 07:41.480
Kiev was the grand prize for the invading force—and yet they only made it to the city's

07:41.480 --> 07:42.480
suburbs.

07:42.480 --> 07:47.020
Until there, they met fierce resistance and made little progress, turning the night that

07:47.020 --> 07:51.260
many feared would mark the capital's fall into but a night.

07:51.260 --> 07:56.640
As day two became three, photos and videos emerged that started to paint a more cohesive

07:56.640 --> 07:57.880
picture.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.500
Russian tanks were running out of fuel and left abandoned, strewn across the country.

08:02.500 --> 08:06.880
The invading troops were seen looting stores for food, potentially due to a lack of their

08:06.880 --> 08:08.040
own.

08:08.040 --> 08:13.320
Stories emerged of Russian forces asking Ukrainian civilians for supplies and directions, seemingly

08:13.320 --> 08:17.080
unaware of the average person's opinion on them in the country they were attempting

08:17.080 --> 08:18.540
to conquer.

08:18.540 --> 08:22.400
Across the board, as they approached the urban areas that could only be taken with the most

08:22.400 --> 08:28.160
tactful coordination, the Russian military was looking disorganized and disconnected—just

08:28.160 --> 08:35.520
a few disparate forces tasked with going in, guns blazing, to induce a quick and easy surrender.

08:35.520 --> 08:40.600
Of course, that is not what came to fruition.

08:40.600 --> 08:46.400
The Ukrainian defense included a recognition of what the Russian offense seemingly missed—the

08:46.400 --> 08:48.200
importance of logistics.

08:48.200 --> 08:54.380
In the famous words of General John J. Pershing, quote, infantry wins battles, logistics wins

08:54.380 --> 08:55.480
wars.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.480
So, Ukraine went for Russia's logistics.

08:59.480 --> 09:04.360
On social media platforms adapted to organize the country's guerrilla-style defense, posts

09:04.360 --> 09:08.140
circulated stressing the value of destroying fuel trucks.

09:08.140 --> 09:13.040
Of course, if you stop the fuel trucks, you stop the tanks, and unlike tanks, fuel trucks

09:13.040 --> 09:17.600
are typically unarmored and can be destroyed with cheap, accessible bullets or Molotov

09:17.600 --> 09:18.600
cocktails.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.960
When the Russians started disguising their fuel trucks to look more like traditional

09:21.960 --> 09:27.040
transport trucks, posts and messages quickly followed making the updated target profile

09:27.040 --> 09:28.040
clear.

09:28.040 --> 09:32.540
Ukrainian forces also destroyed two key bridges into Kiev, allowing them to focus on defending

09:32.540 --> 09:37.620
a smaller number of chokepoints, and similar tactics were used elsewhere in the country.

09:37.620 --> 09:41.740
The Ukrainian military also destroyed all connections between the Russian and Ukrainian

09:41.740 --> 09:45.860
rail networks to prevent the invading force from taking hold of them to ramp up their

09:45.860 --> 09:47.140
supply lines.

09:47.140 --> 09:52.620
Elsewhere, across the country, towns and cities dismantled their street signs or, in some

09:52.620 --> 09:57.700
cases, painted over them to read Welcome to Hell, making it harder for Russian troops,

09:57.700 --> 10:02.180
many of which relied solely on paper maps, to navigate around the country.

10:02.180 --> 10:07.620
Meanwhile, with the Russian military relying nearly entirely on analog, unsecured radio

10:07.620 --> 10:12.300
communications, amateur radio enthusiasts and hacktivist organizations like Anonymous

10:12.300 --> 10:15.660
worked to block and surveil enemy radio frequencies.

10:15.660 --> 10:20.380
Some even went further to broadcast pig sounds, thematic music, or written messages that would

10:20.380 --> 10:23.240
appear when analyzed on a spectrogram.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.060
Russia countered this with strategic disinformation, purportedly spreading this post listing fake

10:28.060 --> 10:32.460
frequencies across social media, but the Ukrainian side quickly caught on and spread

10:32.460 --> 10:36.300
the corrected frequencies across their means of communication.

10:36.300 --> 10:43.160
Now, to experts, the Russian military's logistics difficulties were hardly surprising.

10:43.160 --> 10:47.140
In fact, they represented a historical throughline.

10:47.140 --> 10:52.940
When analyzing the disastrous Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s, poor logistics performance

10:52.940 --> 10:57.880
is an off-sighted reason for the USSR's failure to achieve its objectives.

10:57.880 --> 11:02.880
According to tacticians, their logistics support forces were inflexible and underequipped,

11:02.880 --> 11:07.240
which left the fighting forces too underequipped to perform their jobs.

11:07.240 --> 11:12.240
Of course, thanks to their vast railway network, which nearly entirely falls under state control,

11:12.240 --> 11:17.500
Russia's military has that incredible domestic mobilization capability.

11:17.500 --> 11:22.540
In fact, some 30,000 of their personnel serve in the Russian railway troops, whose task

11:22.540 --> 11:27.440
involves the defense, use, and construction of railways for military purposes.

11:27.440 --> 11:32.960
This force, larger than that of most countries, is indicative of just how crucial this one

11:32.960 --> 11:36.360
infrastructure asset is to their military machine.

11:36.360 --> 11:42.200
However, this domestic advantage, this reliance on the rails, simultaneously represents an

11:42.200 --> 11:46.600
Achilles' heel when conflicts take place beyond their borders.

11:46.600 --> 11:51.760
When war stretches past their furthest rail yards, Russian military logistics capabilities

11:51.760 --> 11:54.400
are, at best, mediocre.

11:54.400 --> 11:59.360
In the case of this invasion, the primary advanced rail yards being used are in Belarus

11:59.360 --> 12:05.360
and Russia itself, so for any further supply lines, especially any stretching into Ukraine,

12:05.360 --> 12:07.840
Russia had to resort to trucks.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.700
And simply put, Russia doesn't have enough trucks.

12:12.700 --> 12:17.680
Each of Russia's combined arms armies, the largest organizational unit of their ground

12:17.680 --> 12:23.280
forces, is typically supported by one material technical support brigade—essentially, their

12:23.280 --> 12:25.400
logistic support forces.

12:25.400 --> 12:30.460
Each of these brigades is composed of around 1,000 personnel operating 408 transport vehicles

12:30.460 --> 12:34.440
capable of hauling 1,870 tons of cargo.

12:34.440 --> 12:38.360
This, it turns out, is rather inadequate.

12:38.360 --> 12:43.360
According to retired US Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vershinin, a conflict modeling and simulations

12:43.360 --> 12:49.240
expert, Russia's forces, under their current configuration, are simply incapable of properly

12:49.240 --> 12:54.600
supporting a fight more than 90 miles or 145 kilometers from supply dumps—in this

12:54.600 --> 12:56.300
case, rail yards.

12:56.300 --> 13:00.920
And these assumptions were based on a 45-mile or 70-kilometer-per-hour average transport

13:00.920 --> 13:06.360
speed which is likely only attained when territory is firmly within Russian control—something

13:06.360 --> 13:09.580
that proved elusive in the opening days of this invasion.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.900
A highly active conflict reliant on rocket artillery fire, which accurately describes

13:13.900 --> 13:19.420
this war, is even more resource-intensive on the logistic support forces as each individual

13:19.420 --> 13:23.240
rocket requires a dedicated truck for transport to the launcher.

13:23.240 --> 13:27.440
With the frequency of artillery fire in the early days of the invasion, a large chunk

13:27.440 --> 13:32.200
of Russia's material technical support brigade's capability was certainly tied up in supplying

13:32.200 --> 13:34.960
ammunition to launch sites.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.740
This general incapability seemingly reflects in Russia's strategy in Ukraine.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.960
Currently, the predominant characterization is that Russia believed that through a combination

13:43.960 --> 13:49.220
of dramatic airborne and land-based attacks in the opening hours and days of the invasion,

13:49.220 --> 13:51.320
the Ukrainians would quickly capitulate.

13:51.320 --> 13:56.280
They'd either surrender or Russian forces would quickly reach Kiev, topple the government,

13:56.280 --> 14:00.600
and install a puppet government—a belief that was supported by nearly all independent

14:00.600 --> 14:03.760
analysts prior to the conflict's start.

14:03.760 --> 14:08.640
Analysis suggests that when invading, Russia's forces can operate largely self-sufficiently,

14:08.640 --> 14:12.420
without logistic support, for about three to five days.

14:12.420 --> 14:17.180
So, when the conflict did not conclude within that timeframe, the Russians found themselves

14:17.180 --> 14:20.340
scrambling to regroup and resupply.

14:20.340 --> 14:26.500
Now, most Western forces, which are generally much better equipped from a logistics standpoint,

14:26.500 --> 14:31.240
operate on a pull-based system, where fighting forces request resupplies as needed, based

14:31.240 --> 14:33.020
on what actually occurs.

14:33.020 --> 14:38.260
Meanwhile, the Russian military operates predominantly on a push-based system, where forces are

14:38.280 --> 14:42.760
resupplied on a more predictable basis, as determined by leadership.

14:42.760 --> 14:47.360
This means that, in practice, there is more strategic decision-making and prioritization

14:47.360 --> 14:52.280
of which forces most need or warrant resupply, and which materials are most important to

14:52.280 --> 14:53.280
resupply.

14:53.280 --> 14:59.000
So, in Ukraine, it's likely that ammunition was prioritized ahead of, say, fuel for tanks

14:59.000 --> 15:01.520
on less strategically important fronts.

15:01.520 --> 15:06.640
In the context of perpetual logistics limitations, as is the case for Russia's military, this

15:06.660 --> 15:10.540
is likely the more effective approach, but in the grand scheme of things it's certainly

15:10.540 --> 15:15.800
less effective than the Western pull approach, which focuses on flexible logistics that adapt

15:15.800 --> 15:17.800
to real-world conditions.

15:17.800 --> 15:24.400
In short, Western forces let strategy lead logistics, while Russian forces let logistics

15:24.400 --> 15:26.200
lead strategy.

15:26.200 --> 15:30.980
The single factor that can best address these issues, however, is time.

15:30.980 --> 15:36.620
The Russian military does have the capabilities to set a warzone up for a more prolonged conflict.

15:37.600 --> 15:41.680
Its material technical support brigades include tactical pipeline battalions, for example,

15:41.680 --> 15:46.000
that can quickly construct networks in Ukraine to bring fuel and water closer to the active

15:46.000 --> 15:49.280
fronts without the need for burdensome supply convoys.

15:49.280 --> 15:53.880
Russia's railway troops can do the same with rail infrastructure, mending or constructing

15:53.880 --> 15:58.680
networks to support a long-term conflict or occupation, and the country can take a page

15:58.680 --> 16:02.840
out of the Soviet playbook, leveraging the full might of the public and private sectors

16:02.840 --> 16:05.600
to support the military's operations.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.880
What the opening days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have done, however, is exposed

16:09.880 --> 16:14.860
a weak point in the nation's military might—or perhaps demonstrated that the weak points

16:14.860 --> 16:18.220
of the Soviet military are still present.

16:18.220 --> 16:23.740
Logistics capabilities are arguably one major strategic advantage of many Western militaries—especially

16:23.740 --> 16:28.920
the US's, whose global network of military bases and massive sea and airlift capabilities

16:28.920 --> 16:33.140
allow it to properly supply conflict truly anywhere on earth.

16:33.140 --> 16:38.200
For Russia to have failed so visibly mere miles from its border exposes its Achilles'

16:38.200 --> 16:40.560
heel to any future adversary.

16:40.560 --> 16:46.240
Tragically, however, these early struggles appear to make the Russian military only more

16:46.240 --> 16:47.240
desperate.

16:47.240 --> 16:53.240
As the conflict prolonged, the invaders resorted to looting, to shelling civilian areas, to

16:53.240 --> 16:57.560
increasingly destructive weaponry, and to more deadly techniques to compensate for their

16:57.560 --> 17:00.000
lack of strategic tact.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.800
Therefore, the true cause for Russia's failure is borne on the innocent casualties

17:05.800 --> 17:12.780
of war—Ukrainian defenders, Russian conscripts, and perhaps most tragically, the Ukrainian

17:12.780 --> 17:18.120
civilians who were displaced, injured, or killed simply for staying in the place they

17:18.120 --> 17:21.740
called home.

17:21.740 --> 17:26.860
As many of you know, covering topics relating to war and conflict can be difficult on YouTube.

17:26.860 --> 17:30.900
Unfortunately, that's just the nature of an ad-supported platform—content needs to

17:30.900 --> 17:32.780
be considered safe by advertisers.

17:32.780 --> 17:37.620
We've had to carefully write and edit this video to hopefully stay within YouTube's

17:37.620 --> 17:38.620
content guidelines.

17:38.620 --> 17:43.060
However, there is value in the topics that advertisers don't consider safe.

17:43.060 --> 17:47.780
That's the ethos behind Nebula—it's a streaming site founded and owned by creators,

17:47.780 --> 17:51.540
including myself, so it was made to be the best home for what we make.

17:51.540 --> 17:56.220
That means we can operate without constraints—we're not beholden to advertisers or an algorithm.

17:56.260 --> 18:00.460
That's how Joseph from RealLifeLore was able to make his exclusive Modern Conflict

18:00.460 --> 18:04.440
series, which presents amazingly detailed accounts of the conflicts in Ukraine leading

18:04.440 --> 18:09.260
up to this most recent, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Russian invasion of Georgia,

18:09.260 --> 18:11.240
along with plenty of others.

18:11.240 --> 18:15.720
Those are absolutely worth a watch, but in addition, Nebula is also the exclusive home

18:15.720 --> 18:19.700
to four different documentaries of ours, and a series called Crime Spree made by the Half

18:19.700 --> 18:20.700
as Interesting team.

18:20.700 --> 18:25.660
In it, I'm given $5,000 to try to break eight weird laws all across the US in 72 hours,

18:26.100 --> 18:30.340
while the HAI writing team is given $3,000 and a tracker to try to catch up and tag me

18:30.340 --> 18:33.580
so I lose a point, and you all have been loving it.

18:33.580 --> 18:37.780
Beyond that, there are even more exclusive big-budget Nebula originals by us and other

18:37.780 --> 18:42.060
educational-ish creators, there are all our normal videos uploaded early without ads or

18:42.060 --> 18:45.660
sponsorships, and new stuff comes out every single day.

18:45.660 --> 18:49.960
And then what makes Nebula even better is the best way to get access to it—the CuriosityStream

18:49.960 --> 18:51.100
bundle deal.

18:51.100 --> 18:54.560
With this, you sign up for a CuriosityStream subscription, meaning you get access to their

18:54.560 --> 18:59.300
enormous catalog of top-quality non-fiction shows and documentaries, like the one we made,

18:59.300 --> 19:00.300
The Colorado Problem.

19:00.300 --> 19:05.760
But then, by signing up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you also get Nebula included

19:05.760 --> 19:07.640
at no extra cost.

19:07.640 --> 19:13.240
With a current discount, that means you get two streaming sites for a year for just $14.79

19:13.240 --> 19:15.360
total—not monthly.

19:15.360 --> 19:18.560
Considering how long you certainly spend scrolling through other streaming sites looking for

19:18.560 --> 19:23.120
something to watch, the $14.79 is probably worth it just for the exclusive stuff we've

19:23.120 --> 19:26.280
made, which you're pretty sure to like if you like Wendover, because they're really

19:26.280 --> 19:29.740
just longer, bigger-budget, better Wendover videos.

19:29.740 --> 19:33.820
But then there's everything on top of that, so head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover

19:33.820 --> 19:38.280
to sign up, click the button on screen, and you'll be supporting a huge number of independent

19:38.280 --> 19:40.040
creators while you're at it.
