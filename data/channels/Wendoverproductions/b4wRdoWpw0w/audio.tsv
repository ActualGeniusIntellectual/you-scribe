0	2920	It all happened so quickly.
2920	10620	On February 24th, 2022, just after 2 AM Ukraine time, Vladimir Putin, the autocrat of Russia,
10620	23040	announced in a pre-recorded TV address a quote, special military operation in Ukraine.
23040	26400	To the rest of the world, that meant war.
26400	31020	Within minutes, the shelling started, the skies lit up, and the Russian invasion of
31020	46080	Ukraine had begun.
46080	51760	To many Ukrainians, though, this was perceived not as a beginning, but a continuation—a
51760	56880	continuation of the conflict that began some eight years prior in the spring of 2014.
56880	61600	Ever since Russia and the rebels it backed overtook Crimea and swaths of eastern Ukraine,
61600	66200	the country has maintained an enlarged and active military presence along Ukraine's
66200	67200	borders.
67200	72540	In 2017, for example, Russia re-established the famed but disbanded 8th Combined Arms
72540	75160	Army here, in Novichirkassk.
75160	79880	Revived under the pretense that it was a defensive decision, the 8th Combined Army has since
79880	85040	grown, adding artillery, missile subunits, and even, some analysts believe, incorporating
85040	88200	separatists into its own ranks.
88200	91500	This is hardly an isolated development.
91500	96680	From Sevastopol on the southern tip of Crimea, to Klincy along Ukraine's northern border,
96680	102060	Russian bases, staging points, and general military infrastructure have grown to increasingly
102060	105000	surround Ukraine since 2014.
105000	109600	This extension of military might was made possible by the physical seizure of the land,
109600	114360	and, in the eyes of Russian leadership, justified by the threat the Ukraine could retaliate
114360	117400	or try to seize back occupied territories.
117400	123160	This extension has also, in turn, quite literally paved the path for Russia to amass an extraordinary
123160	129000	75% of their principal combat units within striking distance of Ukraine.
129000	134840	On Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry announced that 90,000 Russian
134840	138400	troops had encircled the country's borders and occupied territories.
138400	143700	The Russian forces that were in the region for supposed exercises simply weren't leaving.
143700	148840	Not only were they not going away, but, as the next few months would reveal, their numbers
148840	150640	were growing.
150640	155680	This is a satellite image from outside the western Russian town of Jena in September,
155680	159520	and this is the exact same spot on November 1st.
159520	163820	From an empty field and a dirt road, to the staging area for the Russian 41st Combined
163820	169740	Army, normally headquartered some 2,000 miles or 3,000 kilometers away, suddenly sat north
169740	175180	of 1,200 tanks, howitzers, towed artillery, and support vehicles.
175180	178900	And November only marked the beginning.
178900	183240	Satellite images and social media posts tracked soldiers and supplies pouring into southwest
183240	188960	Russia across December, but what alarmed analysts most was the fact that along with the soldiers
188960	193920	and supplies, there were medical units, hospital tents, and fuel reserves.
193920	198160	The Russians were amassing the infrastructure for war.
198160	201940	The likelihood that this was a simulation plummeted.
201940	206800	In January, Russian forces rolled into Belarus for joint exercises.
206800	211200	Weeks later, it was announced that the soldiers would stay.
211200	215420	Established staging areas like Jena further expanded, while new ones popped up, forming
215420	218940	an increasingly foreboding arc around Ukraine.
218940	224580	Now, behind the scenes, what made this massive domestic mobilization of troops, weapons,
224580	229080	and supplies possible was Russia's vast rail network.
229080	232980	This rail network's extent, earning its status as the third largest in the world,
232980	238260	is a byproduct of the country's size, sparsity, and the suspect nature of its road network.
238260	242940	Meanwhile, the degree of state control, with a government owning some 20 of the country's
242940	246500	10,000 locomotives, is a legacy of the Soviet era.
246500	251720	This control and extensiveness combined means that Russia's military is able to rely heavily
251720	253160	on the rail network.
253160	258140	It was trains that moved the troops, tanks, and trucks to and from Jena, into Kursk, and
258140	261260	across the Bryansk and Smolensk oblasts.
261260	265260	Digital forensics have shown that it was also trains that moved supplies from eastern Russia
265260	270260	all the way to Belarus, and it was largely thanks to these trains, or Russia's reliance
270260	275480	on them, that outsiders were able to so precisely document the military buildup as dashcams
275480	280740	filmed transiting tanks at rail crossings—videos which then ended up on TikTok and circulated
280740	282900	the world over.
282900	285860	Trains set the stage.
285860	292420	In the first weeks of February, under a curtain of clouds, Jena emptied out, its troops and
292420	295340	supplies tracked south.
295340	299860	As these Russian forces pushed ever nearer to the Ukrainian border, tanks appeared in
299860	305780	Kursk, just a 140 mile or 220 kilometer drive from Kharkiv, while additional troops and
305780	311940	trucks amassed near Gomel, Belarus—20 miles or 32 kilometers away from the border.
311940	318740	Across three and a half months, 175,000 Russian troops had stacked up all along Ukraine's
318740	323900	border, ready to unleash death and destruction in the country they believed they were there
323900	333100	to liberate.
333100	337960	In the opening hours of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the invading force worked to cripple
337960	341180	Ukraine's military infrastructure.
341180	345620	Some of the first volleys of the conflict involved air strikes on Ukrainian air bases,
345620	350580	in an effort to help Russia quickly gain air superiority without strong resistance.
350580	354560	Eleven were destroyed across the first day of hostilities.
354560	360180	By noon, focus shifted from anticipatory defense to offense as dozens of Russian helicopters
360180	364780	landed troops at Hostomel airport mere miles from Kiev.
364780	369060	This was seemingly in an effort to create an air bridge—seizing control of the airport
369060	373300	to allow planes to bring in more troops who would push out into Kiev.
373300	377860	An air-based supplying line could assure a certain level of logistical support regardless
377860	380980	of conditions on the ground between the border and Kiev.
380980	386060	However, also recognizing this, Ukraine tasked its fourth Rapid Reaction Brigade to retake
386060	389740	the airport, which it successfully did by 8 PM.
389740	393560	Across the same day, as fighting reached the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and troops poured
393560	399200	in from every direction, work continued behind the front lines to support the continued invasion.
399200	403740	In Brest, Belarus, Russian forces could be seen unloading supplies from railcars and assembling
403740	407600	into a convoy configuration, facing south, towards the war zone.
407600	412060	In Koniki, near Belarus' closest point to Kiev, satellite imagery captured a road
412060	417200	that Russians converted into a helicopter base, with an X marking each landing zone.
417200	422400	To the east, in Russia itself, a field hospital could be seen ready to treat early casualties,
422400	426560	while nearby, another makeshift facility home to artillery and rocket launchers used in
426560	429760	the opening hours of the conflict stood ready for more.
429760	434720	However, despite all the well-planned war infrastructure constructed around Ukraine,
434720	439680	things inside the war zone were seemingly going less to plan.
439680	444260	As the sun rose from a bloody night onto the second day of battle, Russian forces set their
444260	449960	sights on Kiev—the country's capital, home to its government and lauded leader Volodymyr
449960	451500	Zelensky.
451500	455720	Under the assumption that Russia's ultimate ambition was to install a puppet government,
455720	461480	Kiev was the grand prize for the invading force—and yet they only made it to the city's
461480	462480	suburbs.
462480	467020	Until there, they met fierce resistance and made little progress, turning the night that
467020	471260	many feared would mark the capital's fall into but a night.
471260	476640	As day two became three, photos and videos emerged that started to paint a more cohesive
476640	477880	picture.
477880	482500	Russian tanks were running out of fuel and left abandoned, strewn across the country.
482500	486880	The invading troops were seen looting stores for food, potentially due to a lack of their
486880	488040	own.
488040	493320	Stories emerged of Russian forces asking Ukrainian civilians for supplies and directions, seemingly
493320	497080	unaware of the average person's opinion on them in the country they were attempting
497080	498540	to conquer.
498540	502400	Across the board, as they approached the urban areas that could only be taken with the most
502400	508160	tactful coordination, the Russian military was looking disorganized and disconnected—just
508160	515520	a few disparate forces tasked with going in, guns blazing, to induce a quick and easy surrender.
515520	520600	Of course, that is not what came to fruition.
520600	526400	The Ukrainian defense included a recognition of what the Russian offense seemingly missed—the
526400	528200	importance of logistics.
528200	534380	In the famous words of General John J. Pershing, quote, infantry wins battles, logistics wins
534380	535480	wars.
535480	539480	So, Ukraine went for Russia's logistics.
539480	544360	On social media platforms adapted to organize the country's guerrilla-style defense, posts
544360	548140	circulated stressing the value of destroying fuel trucks.
548140	553040	Of course, if you stop the fuel trucks, you stop the tanks, and unlike tanks, fuel trucks
553040	557600	are typically unarmored and can be destroyed with cheap, accessible bullets or Molotov
557600	558600	cocktails.
558600	561960	When the Russians started disguising their fuel trucks to look more like traditional
561960	567040	transport trucks, posts and messages quickly followed making the updated target profile
567040	568040	clear.
568040	572540	Ukrainian forces also destroyed two key bridges into Kiev, allowing them to focus on defending
572540	577620	a smaller number of chokepoints, and similar tactics were used elsewhere in the country.
577620	581740	The Ukrainian military also destroyed all connections between the Russian and Ukrainian
581740	585860	rail networks to prevent the invading force from taking hold of them to ramp up their
585860	587140	supply lines.
587140	592620	Elsewhere, across the country, towns and cities dismantled their street signs or, in some
592620	597700	cases, painted over them to read Welcome to Hell, making it harder for Russian troops,
597700	602180	many of which relied solely on paper maps, to navigate around the country.
602180	607620	Meanwhile, with the Russian military relying nearly entirely on analog, unsecured radio
607620	612300	communications, amateur radio enthusiasts and hacktivist organizations like Anonymous
612300	615660	worked to block and surveil enemy radio frequencies.
615660	620380	Some even went further to broadcast pig sounds, thematic music, or written messages that would
620380	623240	appear when analyzed on a spectrogram.
623240	628060	Russia countered this with strategic disinformation, purportedly spreading this post listing fake
628060	632460	frequencies across social media, but the Ukrainian side quickly caught on and spread
632460	636300	the corrected frequencies across their means of communication.
636300	643160	Now, to experts, the Russian military's logistics difficulties were hardly surprising.
643160	647140	In fact, they represented a historical throughline.
647140	652940	When analyzing the disastrous Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s, poor logistics performance
652940	657880	is an off-sighted reason for the USSR's failure to achieve its objectives.
657880	662880	According to tacticians, their logistics support forces were inflexible and underequipped,
662880	667240	which left the fighting forces too underequipped to perform their jobs.
667240	672240	Of course, thanks to their vast railway network, which nearly entirely falls under state control,
672240	677500	Russia's military has that incredible domestic mobilization capability.
677500	682540	In fact, some 30,000 of their personnel serve in the Russian railway troops, whose task
682540	687440	involves the defense, use, and construction of railways for military purposes.
687440	692960	This force, larger than that of most countries, is indicative of just how crucial this one
692960	696360	infrastructure asset is to their military machine.
696360	702200	However, this domestic advantage, this reliance on the rails, simultaneously represents an
702200	706600	Achilles' heel when conflicts take place beyond their borders.
706600	711760	When war stretches past their furthest rail yards, Russian military logistics capabilities
711760	714400	are, at best, mediocre.
714400	719360	In the case of this invasion, the primary advanced rail yards being used are in Belarus
719360	725360	and Russia itself, so for any further supply lines, especially any stretching into Ukraine,
725360	727840	Russia had to resort to trucks.
727840	732700	And simply put, Russia doesn't have enough trucks.
732700	737680	Each of Russia's combined arms armies, the largest organizational unit of their ground
737680	743280	forces, is typically supported by one material technical support brigade—essentially, their
743280	745400	logistic support forces.
745400	750460	Each of these brigades is composed of around 1,000 personnel operating 408 transport vehicles
750460	754440	capable of hauling 1,870 tons of cargo.
754440	758360	This, it turns out, is rather inadequate.
758360	763360	According to retired US Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vershinin, a conflict modeling and simulations
763360	769240	expert, Russia's forces, under their current configuration, are simply incapable of properly
769240	774600	supporting a fight more than 90 miles or 145 kilometers from supply dumps—in this
774600	776300	case, rail yards.
776300	780920	And these assumptions were based on a 45-mile or 70-kilometer-per-hour average transport
780920	786360	speed which is likely only attained when territory is firmly within Russian control—something
786360	789580	that proved elusive in the opening days of this invasion.
789580	793900	A highly active conflict reliant on rocket artillery fire, which accurately describes
793900	799420	this war, is even more resource-intensive on the logistic support forces as each individual
799420	803240	rocket requires a dedicated truck for transport to the launcher.
803240	807440	With the frequency of artillery fire in the early days of the invasion, a large chunk
807440	812200	of Russia's material technical support brigade's capability was certainly tied up in supplying
812200	814960	ammunition to launch sites.
814960	819740	This general incapability seemingly reflects in Russia's strategy in Ukraine.
819760	823960	Currently, the predominant characterization is that Russia believed that through a combination
823960	829220	of dramatic airborne and land-based attacks in the opening hours and days of the invasion,
829220	831320	the Ukrainians would quickly capitulate.
831320	836280	They'd either surrender or Russian forces would quickly reach Kiev, topple the government,
836280	840600	and install a puppet government—a belief that was supported by nearly all independent
840600	843760	analysts prior to the conflict's start.
843760	848640	Analysis suggests that when invading, Russia's forces can operate largely self-sufficiently,
848640	852420	without logistic support, for about three to five days.
852420	857180	So, when the conflict did not conclude within that timeframe, the Russians found themselves
857180	860340	scrambling to regroup and resupply.
860340	866500	Now, most Western forces, which are generally much better equipped from a logistics standpoint,
866500	871240	operate on a pull-based system, where fighting forces request resupplies as needed, based
871240	873020	on what actually occurs.
873020	878260	Meanwhile, the Russian military operates predominantly on a push-based system, where forces are
878280	882760	resupplied on a more predictable basis, as determined by leadership.
882760	887360	This means that, in practice, there is more strategic decision-making and prioritization
887360	892280	of which forces most need or warrant resupply, and which materials are most important to
892280	893280	resupply.
893280	899000	So, in Ukraine, it's likely that ammunition was prioritized ahead of, say, fuel for tanks
899000	901520	on less strategically important fronts.
901520	906640	In the context of perpetual logistics limitations, as is the case for Russia's military, this
906660	910540	is likely the more effective approach, but in the grand scheme of things it's certainly
910540	915800	less effective than the Western pull approach, which focuses on flexible logistics that adapt
915800	917800	to real-world conditions.
917800	924400	In short, Western forces let strategy lead logistics, while Russian forces let logistics
924400	926200	lead strategy.
926200	930980	The single factor that can best address these issues, however, is time.
930980	936620	The Russian military does have the capabilities to set a warzone up for a more prolonged conflict.
937600	941680	Its material technical support brigades include tactical pipeline battalions, for example,
941680	946000	that can quickly construct networks in Ukraine to bring fuel and water closer to the active
946000	949280	fronts without the need for burdensome supply convoys.
949280	953880	Russia's railway troops can do the same with rail infrastructure, mending or constructing
953880	958680	networks to support a long-term conflict or occupation, and the country can take a page
958680	962840	out of the Soviet playbook, leveraging the full might of the public and private sectors
962840	965600	to support the military's operations.
965600	969880	What the opening days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have done, however, is exposed
969880	974860	a weak point in the nation's military might—or perhaps demonstrated that the weak points
974860	978220	of the Soviet military are still present.
978220	983740	Logistics capabilities are arguably one major strategic advantage of many Western militaries—especially
983740	988920	the US's, whose global network of military bases and massive sea and airlift capabilities
988920	993140	allow it to properly supply conflict truly anywhere on earth.
993140	998200	For Russia to have failed so visibly mere miles from its border exposes its Achilles'
998200	1000560	heel to any future adversary.
1000560	1006240	Tragically, however, these early struggles appear to make the Russian military only more
1006240	1007240	desperate.
1007240	1013240	As the conflict prolonged, the invaders resorted to looting, to shelling civilian areas, to
1013240	1017560	increasingly destructive weaponry, and to more deadly techniques to compensate for their
1017560	1020000	lack of strategic tact.
1020000	1025800	Therefore, the true cause for Russia's failure is borne on the innocent casualties
1025800	1032780	of war—Ukrainian defenders, Russian conscripts, and perhaps most tragically, the Ukrainian
1032780	1038120	civilians who were displaced, injured, or killed simply for staying in the place they
1038120	1041740	called home.
1041740	1046860	As many of you know, covering topics relating to war and conflict can be difficult on YouTube.
1046860	1050900	Unfortunately, that's just the nature of an ad-supported platform—content needs to
1050900	1052780	be considered safe by advertisers.
1052780	1057620	We've had to carefully write and edit this video to hopefully stay within YouTube's
1057620	1058620	content guidelines.
1058620	1063060	However, there is value in the topics that advertisers don't consider safe.
1063060	1067780	That's the ethos behind Nebula—it's a streaming site founded and owned by creators,
1067780	1071540	including myself, so it was made to be the best home for what we make.
1071540	1076220	That means we can operate without constraints—we're not beholden to advertisers or an algorithm.
1076260	1080460	That's how Joseph from RealLifeLore was able to make his exclusive Modern Conflict
1080460	1084440	series, which presents amazingly detailed accounts of the conflicts in Ukraine leading
1084440	1089260	up to this most recent, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Russian invasion of Georgia,
1089260	1091240	along with plenty of others.
1091240	1095720	Those are absolutely worth a watch, but in addition, Nebula is also the exclusive home
1095720	1099700	to four different documentaries of ours, and a series called Crime Spree made by the Half
1099700	1100700	as Interesting team.
1100700	1105660	In it, I'm given $5,000 to try to break eight weird laws all across the US in 72 hours,
1106100	1110340	while the HAI writing team is given $3,000 and a tracker to try to catch up and tag me
1110340	1113580	so I lose a point, and you all have been loving it.
1113580	1117780	Beyond that, there are even more exclusive big-budget Nebula originals by us and other
1117780	1122060	educational-ish creators, there are all our normal videos uploaded early without ads or
1122060	1125660	sponsorships, and new stuff comes out every single day.
1125660	1129960	And then what makes Nebula even better is the best way to get access to it—the CuriosityStream
1129960	1131100	bundle deal.
1131100	1134560	With this, you sign up for a CuriosityStream subscription, meaning you get access to their
