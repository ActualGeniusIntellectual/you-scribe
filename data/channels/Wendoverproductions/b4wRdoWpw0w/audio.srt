1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
It all happened so quickly.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:10,620
On February 24th, 2022, just after 2 AM Ukraine time, Vladimir Putin, the autocrat of Russia,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:23,040
announced in a pre-recorded TV address a quote, special military operation in Ukraine.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,400
To the rest of the world, that meant war.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,020
Within minutes, the shelling started, the skies lit up, and the Russian invasion of

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:46,080
Ukraine had begun.

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,760
To many Ukrainians, though, this was perceived not as a beginning, but a continuation—a

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,880
continuation of the conflict that began some eight years prior in the spring of 2014.

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,600
Ever since Russia and the rebels it backed overtook Crimea and swaths of eastern Ukraine,

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,200
the country has maintained an enlarged and active military presence along Ukraine's

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
borders.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,540
In 2017, for example, Russia re-established the famed but disbanded 8th Combined Arms

13
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,160
Army here, in Novichirkassk.

14
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,880
Revived under the pretense that it was a defensive decision, the 8th Combined Army has since

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,040
grown, adding artillery, missile subunits, and even, some analysts believe, incorporating

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,200
separatists into its own ranks.

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,500
This is hardly an isolated development.

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,680
From Sevastopol on the southern tip of Crimea, to Klincy along Ukraine's northern border,

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,060
Russian bases, staging points, and general military infrastructure have grown to increasingly

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,000
surround Ukraine since 2014.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,600
This extension of military might was made possible by the physical seizure of the land,

22
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,360
and, in the eyes of Russian leadership, justified by the threat the Ukraine could retaliate

23
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,400
or try to seize back occupied territories.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,160
This extension has also, in turn, quite literally paved the path for Russia to amass an extraordinary

25
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:09,000
75% of their principal combat units within striking distance of Ukraine.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,840
On Wednesday, November 3rd, 2021, the Ukrainian Defense Ministry announced that 90,000 Russian

27
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,400
troops had encircled the country's borders and occupied territories.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,700
The Russian forces that were in the region for supposed exercises simply weren't leaving.

29
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,840
Not only were they not going away, but, as the next few months would reveal, their numbers

30
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
were growing.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
This is a satellite image from outside the western Russian town of Jena in September,

32
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,520
and this is the exact same spot on November 1st.

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,820
From an empty field and a dirt road, to the staging area for the Russian 41st Combined

34
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:49,740
Army, normally headquartered some 2,000 miles or 3,000 kilometers away, suddenly sat north

35
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,180
of 1,200 tanks, howitzers, towed artillery, and support vehicles.

36
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,900
And November only marked the beginning.

37
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,240
Satellite images and social media posts tracked soldiers and supplies pouring into southwest

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,960
Russia across December, but what alarmed analysts most was the fact that along with the soldiers

39
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:13,920
and supplies, there were medical units, hospital tents, and fuel reserves.

40
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,160
The Russians were amassing the infrastructure for war.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,940
The likelihood that this was a simulation plummeted.

42
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,800
In January, Russian forces rolled into Belarus for joint exercises.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,200
Weeks later, it was announced that the soldiers would stay.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,420
Established staging areas like Jena further expanded, while new ones popped up, forming

45
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,940
an increasingly foreboding arc around Ukraine.

46
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,580
Now, behind the scenes, what made this massive domestic mobilization of troops, weapons,

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,080
and supplies possible was Russia's vast rail network.

48
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,980
This rail network's extent, earning its status as the third largest in the world,

49
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,260
is a byproduct of the country's size, sparsity, and the suspect nature of its road network.

50
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,940
Meanwhile, the degree of state control, with a government owning some 20 of the country's

51
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:06,500
10,000 locomotives, is a legacy of the Soviet era.

52
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:11,720
This control and extensiveness combined means that Russia's military is able to rely heavily

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,160
on the rail network.

54
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,140
It was trains that moved the troops, tanks, and trucks to and from Jena, into Kursk, and

55
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,260
across the Bryansk and Smolensk oblasts.

56
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,260
Digital forensics have shown that it was also trains that moved supplies from eastern Russia

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,260
all the way to Belarus, and it was largely thanks to these trains, or Russia's reliance

58
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:35,480
on them, that outsiders were able to so precisely document the military buildup as dashcams

59
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,740
filmed transiting tanks at rail crossings—videos which then ended up on TikTok and circulated

60
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,900
the world over.

61
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,860
Trains set the stage.

62
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,420
In the first weeks of February, under a curtain of clouds, Jena emptied out, its troops and

63
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,340
supplies tracked south.

64
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,860
As these Russian forces pushed ever nearer to the Ukrainian border, tanks appeared in

65
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,780
Kursk, just a 140 mile or 220 kilometer drive from Kharkiv, while additional troops and

66
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,940
trucks amassed near Gomel, Belarus—20 miles or 32 kilometers away from the border.

67
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,740
Across three and a half months, 175,000 Russian troops had stacked up all along Ukraine's

68
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,900
border, ready to unleash death and destruction in the country they believed they were there

69
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:33,100
to liberate.

70
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,960
In the opening hours of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the invading force worked to cripple

71
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,180
Ukraine's military infrastructure.

72
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,620
Some of the first volleys of the conflict involved air strikes on Ukrainian air bases,

73
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,580
in an effort to help Russia quickly gain air superiority without strong resistance.

74
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,560
Eleven were destroyed across the first day of hostilities.

75
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,180
By noon, focus shifted from anticipatory defense to offense as dozens of Russian helicopters

76
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,780
landed troops at Hostomel airport mere miles from Kiev.

77
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,060
This was seemingly in an effort to create an air bridge—seizing control of the airport

78
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,300
to allow planes to bring in more troops who would push out into Kiev.

79
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,860
An air-based supplying line could assure a certain level of logistical support regardless

80
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,980
of conditions on the ground between the border and Kiev.

81
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,060
However, also recognizing this, Ukraine tasked its fourth Rapid Reaction Brigade to retake

82
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,740
the airport, which it successfully did by 8 PM.

83
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,560
Across the same day, as fighting reached the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, and troops poured

84
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,200
in from every direction, work continued behind the front lines to support the continued invasion.

85
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,740
In Brest, Belarus, Russian forces could be seen unloading supplies from railcars and assembling

86
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,600
into a convoy configuration, facing south, towards the war zone.

87
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,060
In Koniki, near Belarus' closest point to Kiev, satellite imagery captured a road

88
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,200
that Russians converted into a helicopter base, with an X marking each landing zone.

89
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,400
To the east, in Russia itself, a field hospital could be seen ready to treat early casualties,

90
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,560
while nearby, another makeshift facility home to artillery and rocket launchers used in

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,760
the opening hours of the conflict stood ready for more.

92
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,720
However, despite all the well-planned war infrastructure constructed around Ukraine,

93
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,680
things inside the war zone were seemingly going less to plan.

94
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,260
As the sun rose from a bloody night onto the second day of battle, Russian forces set their

95
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:29,960
sights on Kiev—the country's capital, home to its government and lauded leader Volodymyr

96
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,500
Zelensky.

97
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,720
Under the assumption that Russia's ultimate ambition was to install a puppet government,

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,480
Kiev was the grand prize for the invading force—and yet they only made it to the city's

99
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
suburbs.

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,020
Until there, they met fierce resistance and made little progress, turning the night that

101
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,260
many feared would mark the capital's fall into but a night.

102
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,640
As day two became three, photos and videos emerged that started to paint a more cohesive

103
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,880
picture.

104
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,500
Russian tanks were running out of fuel and left abandoned, strewn across the country.

105
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,880
The invading troops were seen looting stores for food, potentially due to a lack of their

106
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,040
own.

107
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,320
Stories emerged of Russian forces asking Ukrainian civilians for supplies and directions, seemingly

108
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,080
unaware of the average person's opinion on them in the country they were attempting

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,540
to conquer.

110
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,400
Across the board, as they approached the urban areas that could only be taken with the most

111
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,160
tactful coordination, the Russian military was looking disorganized and disconnected—just

112
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,520
a few disparate forces tasked with going in, guns blazing, to induce a quick and easy surrender.

113
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,600
Of course, that is not what came to fruition.

114
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,400
The Ukrainian defense included a recognition of what the Russian offense seemingly missed—the

115
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,200
importance of logistics.

116
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,380
In the famous words of General John J. Pershing, quote, infantry wins battles, logistics wins

117
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,480
wars.

118
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,480
So, Ukraine went for Russia's logistics.

119
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,360
On social media platforms adapted to organize the country's guerrilla-style defense, posts

120
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,140
circulated stressing the value of destroying fuel trucks.

121
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,040
Of course, if you stop the fuel trucks, you stop the tanks, and unlike tanks, fuel trucks

122
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,600
are typically unarmored and can be destroyed with cheap, accessible bullets or Molotov

123
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
cocktails.

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,960
When the Russians started disguising their fuel trucks to look more like traditional

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,040
transport trucks, posts and messages quickly followed making the updated target profile

126
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
clear.

127
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,540
Ukrainian forces also destroyed two key bridges into Kiev, allowing them to focus on defending

128
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:37,620
a smaller number of chokepoints, and similar tactics were used elsewhere in the country.

129
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,740
The Ukrainian military also destroyed all connections between the Russian and Ukrainian

130
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,860
rail networks to prevent the invading force from taking hold of them to ramp up their

131
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,140
supply lines.

132
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:52,620
Elsewhere, across the country, towns and cities dismantled their street signs or, in some

133
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,700
cases, painted over them to read Welcome to Hell, making it harder for Russian troops,

134
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,180
many of which relied solely on paper maps, to navigate around the country.

135
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,620
Meanwhile, with the Russian military relying nearly entirely on analog, unsecured radio

136
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,300
communications, amateur radio enthusiasts and hacktivist organizations like Anonymous

137
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,660
worked to block and surveil enemy radio frequencies.

138
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,380
Some even went further to broadcast pig sounds, thematic music, or written messages that would

139
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,240
appear when analyzed on a spectrogram.

140
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,060
Russia countered this with strategic disinformation, purportedly spreading this post listing fake

141
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,460
frequencies across social media, but the Ukrainian side quickly caught on and spread

142
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,300
the corrected frequencies across their means of communication.

143
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:43,160
Now, to experts, the Russian military's logistics difficulties were hardly surprising.

144
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,140
In fact, they represented a historical throughline.

145
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,940
When analyzing the disastrous Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s, poor logistics performance

146
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,880
is an off-sighted reason for the USSR's failure to achieve its objectives.

147
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,880
According to tacticians, their logistics support forces were inflexible and underequipped,

148
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,240
which left the fighting forces too underequipped to perform their jobs.

149
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,240
Of course, thanks to their vast railway network, which nearly entirely falls under state control,

150
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,500
Russia's military has that incredible domestic mobilization capability.

151
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,540
In fact, some 30,000 of their personnel serve in the Russian railway troops, whose task

152
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,440
involves the defense, use, and construction of railways for military purposes.

153
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,960
This force, larger than that of most countries, is indicative of just how crucial this one

154
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,360
infrastructure asset is to their military machine.

155
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,200
However, this domestic advantage, this reliance on the rails, simultaneously represents an

156
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Achilles' heel when conflicts take place beyond their borders.

157
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,760
When war stretches past their furthest rail yards, Russian military logistics capabilities

158
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,400
are, at best, mediocre.

159
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,360
In the case of this invasion, the primary advanced rail yards being used are in Belarus

160
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,360
and Russia itself, so for any further supply lines, especially any stretching into Ukraine,

161
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,840
Russia had to resort to trucks.

162
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,700
And simply put, Russia doesn't have enough trucks.

163
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,680
Each of Russia's combined arms armies, the largest organizational unit of their ground

164
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,280
forces, is typically supported by one material technical support brigade—essentially, their

165
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,400
logistic support forces.

166
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,460
Each of these brigades is composed of around 1,000 personnel operating 408 transport vehicles

167
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,440
capable of hauling 1,870 tons of cargo.

168
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,360
This, it turns out, is rather inadequate.

169
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,360
According to retired US Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vershinin, a conflict modeling and simulations

170
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,240
expert, Russia's forces, under their current configuration, are simply incapable of properly

171
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,600
supporting a fight more than 90 miles or 145 kilometers from supply dumps—in this

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,300
case, rail yards.

173
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,920
And these assumptions were based on a 45-mile or 70-kilometer-per-hour average transport

174
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,360
speed which is likely only attained when territory is firmly within Russian control—something

175
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,580
that proved elusive in the opening days of this invasion.

176
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,900
A highly active conflict reliant on rocket artillery fire, which accurately describes

177
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,420
this war, is even more resource-intensive on the logistic support forces as each individual

178
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,240
rocket requires a dedicated truck for transport to the launcher.

179
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,440
With the frequency of artillery fire in the early days of the invasion, a large chunk

180
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,200
of Russia's material technical support brigade's capability was certainly tied up in supplying

181
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,960
ammunition to launch sites.

182
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,740
This general incapability seemingly reflects in Russia's strategy in Ukraine.

183
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,960
Currently, the predominant characterization is that Russia believed that through a combination

184
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,220
of dramatic airborne and land-based attacks in the opening hours and days of the invasion,

185
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,320
the Ukrainians would quickly capitulate.

186
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,280
They'd either surrender or Russian forces would quickly reach Kiev, topple the government,

187
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,600
and install a puppet government—a belief that was supported by nearly all independent

188
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,760
analysts prior to the conflict's start.

189
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,640
Analysis suggests that when invading, Russia's forces can operate largely self-sufficiently,

190
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,420
without logistic support, for about three to five days.

191
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,180
So, when the conflict did not conclude within that timeframe, the Russians found themselves

192
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,340
scrambling to regroup and resupply.

193
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,500
Now, most Western forces, which are generally much better equipped from a logistics standpoint,

194
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,240
operate on a pull-based system, where fighting forces request resupplies as needed, based

195
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,020
on what actually occurs.

196
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:38,260
Meanwhile, the Russian military operates predominantly on a push-based system, where forces are

197
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,760
resupplied on a more predictable basis, as determined by leadership.

198
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,360
This means that, in practice, there is more strategic decision-making and prioritization

199
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,280
of which forces most need or warrant resupply, and which materials are most important to

200
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
resupply.

201
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,000
So, in Ukraine, it's likely that ammunition was prioritized ahead of, say, fuel for tanks

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,520
on less strategically important fronts.

203
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,640
In the context of perpetual logistics limitations, as is the case for Russia's military, this

204
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,540
is likely the more effective approach, but in the grand scheme of things it's certainly

205
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,800
less effective than the Western pull approach, which focuses on flexible logistics that adapt

206
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
to real-world conditions.

207
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:24,400
In short, Western forces let strategy lead logistics, while Russian forces let logistics

208
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,200
lead strategy.

209
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,980
The single factor that can best address these issues, however, is time.

210
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,620
The Russian military does have the capabilities to set a warzone up for a more prolonged conflict.

211
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,680
Its material technical support brigades include tactical pipeline battalions, for example,

212
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,000
that can quickly construct networks in Ukraine to bring fuel and water closer to the active

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,280
fronts without the need for burdensome supply convoys.

214
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,880
Russia's railway troops can do the same with rail infrastructure, mending or constructing

215
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,680
networks to support a long-term conflict or occupation, and the country can take a page

216
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,840
out of the Soviet playbook, leveraging the full might of the public and private sectors

217
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,600
to support the military's operations.

218
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,880
What the opening days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have done, however, is exposed

219
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,860
a weak point in the nation's military might—or perhaps demonstrated that the weak points

220
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,220
of the Soviet military are still present.

221
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,740
Logistics capabilities are arguably one major strategic advantage of many Western militaries—especially

222
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,920
the US's, whose global network of military bases and massive sea and airlift capabilities

223
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,140
allow it to properly supply conflict truly anywhere on earth.

224
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,200
For Russia to have failed so visibly mere miles from its border exposes its Achilles'

225
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,560
heel to any future adversary.

226
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,240
Tragically, however, these early struggles appear to make the Russian military only more

227
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
desperate.

228
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,240
As the conflict prolonged, the invaders resorted to looting, to shelling civilian areas, to

229
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,560
increasingly destructive weaponry, and to more deadly techniques to compensate for their

230
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,000
lack of strategic tact.

231
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,800
Therefore, the true cause for Russia's failure is borne on the innocent casualties

232
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:12,780
of war—Ukrainian defenders, Russian conscripts, and perhaps most tragically, the Ukrainian

233
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,120
civilians who were displaced, injured, or killed simply for staying in the place they

234
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,740
called home.

235
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:26,860
As many of you know, covering topics relating to war and conflict can be difficult on YouTube.

236
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,900
Unfortunately, that's just the nature of an ad-supported platform—content needs to

237
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,780
be considered safe by advertisers.

238
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,620
We've had to carefully write and edit this video to hopefully stay within YouTube's

239
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
content guidelines.

240
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,060
However, there is value in the topics that advertisers don't consider safe.

241
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,780
That's the ethos behind Nebula—it's a streaming site founded and owned by creators,

242
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,540
including myself, so it was made to be the best home for what we make.

243
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:56,220
That means we can operate without constraints—we're not beholden to advertisers or an algorithm.

244
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,460
That's how Joseph from RealLifeLore was able to make his exclusive Modern Conflict

245
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,440
series, which presents amazingly detailed accounts of the conflicts in Ukraine leading

246
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,260
up to this most recent, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the Russian invasion of Georgia,

247
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,240
along with plenty of others.

248
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,720
Those are absolutely worth a watch, but in addition, Nebula is also the exclusive home

249
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,700
to four different documentaries of ours, and a series called Crime Spree made by the Half

250
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
as Interesting team.

251
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,660
In it, I'm given $5,000 to try to break eight weird laws all across the US in 72 hours,

252
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,340
while the HAI writing team is given $3,000 and a tracker to try to catch up and tag me

253
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,580
so I lose a point, and you all have been loving it.

254
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,780
Beyond that, there are even more exclusive big-budget Nebula originals by us and other

255
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,060
educational-ish creators, there are all our normal videos uploaded early without ads or

256
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,660
sponsorships, and new stuff comes out every single day.

257
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,960
And then what makes Nebula even better is the best way to get access to it—the CuriosityStream

258
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,100
bundle deal.

259
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,560
With this, you sign up for a CuriosityStream subscription, meaning you get access to their

260
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,300
enormous catalog of top-quality non-fiction shows and documentaries, like the one we made,

261
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,300
The Colorado Problem.

262
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:05,760
But then, by signing up at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you also get Nebula included

263
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,640
at no extra cost.

264
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,240
With a current discount, that means you get two streaming sites for a year for just $14.79

265
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,360
total—not monthly.

266
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,560
Considering how long you certainly spend scrolling through other streaming sites looking for

267
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,120
something to watch, the $14.79 is probably worth it just for the exclusive stuff we've

268
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,280
made, which you're pretty sure to like if you like Wendover, because they're really

269
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,740
just longer, bigger-budget, better Wendover videos.

270
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,820
But then there's everything on top of that, so head to CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover

271
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:38,280
to sign up, click the button on screen, and you'll be supporting a huge number of independent

272
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,040
creators while you're at it.
