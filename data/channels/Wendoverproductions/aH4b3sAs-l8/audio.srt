4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,520
Airlines are pragmatic. Each, inherently, is a sizable organization, as a degree of scale is

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:27,760
necessary due to the massive capital costs needed to, quite literally, get a plane off the ground.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,400
There are no mom and pop airlines. Therefore, airlines have the resources to analyze choices

7
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,840
to a far greater level of detail than most businesses. Any decision that we, the public,

8
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,400
see has passed through such a level of review, such a level of scrutiny, that it must mean

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,000
something. Airlines typically don't make emotional, informal, or off-the-cuff decisions.

10
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,960
Therefore, it's odd how much airlines care about climate change because, from a theoretical

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:06,000
perspective, they shouldn't. It doesn't currently make sense for airlines to care about climate

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,720
change. Of course, from a moral perspective it does, but businesses, traditionally and theoretically,

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,720
don't value morality higher than profit. That's the role of non-profits—the organizational

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,160
structure designed to value social impact first and foremost. For-profit businesses,

15
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,800
in the traditional sense, are designed for profit. Therefore, properly managed, they do what

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,440
generates the most profit, and for airlines, right now, what enables that is to not care about

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,760
climate change. Carbon doesn't have a cost for airlines. With a few exceptions, emitting more

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,560
carbon does not cost the airlines anything, but it enables them to make more profit,

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,360
so the theoretically correct thing for airlines to do is to emit the amount of carbon that enables

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,960
them to generate the most profit regardless of environmental consequences. Some say airlines

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,000
care about climate change for public relations, and they're right, but only to an extent.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
Airlines clearly posture as caring about their carbon footprint because consumers

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,800
increasingly care about their carbon footprint, so being viewed as a greener airline translates

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,160
to being a more desirable choice for consumers, who, unlike for-profit businesses, do care about

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,880
what's morally right to an extent. However, net carbon zero is expensive, biofuel development is

26
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,600
expensive, sustainable aircraft development is expensive—all more expensive than would make

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,200
sense if airlines and aircraft developers exclusively cared about PR. So, the reason

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,520
why airlines are starting to care about climate change is because they're terrified of the R-word.

29
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,320
Regulation. It started already. In France, the National Assembly has passed a bill that would

30
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,200
ban short-haul flights on routes that could be traveled in two and a half hours or less by train.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,560
Here's the worst thing for airlines. Measures like this make absolute perfect sense. With airports

32
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,080
located away from city centers, security lines, less reliable departure times, and more, no journey

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,640
that would take two and a half hours by train could reasonably and reliably be accomplished

34
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
faster by plane. The bill would still allow the shorter flights to operate for the purposes of

35
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,560
connections to longer-haul flights, but passengers just couldn't book the short flights by themselves.

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,680
So, there's no real downside, but there's the massive upside of shifting travelers onto trains,

37
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,520
which in the case of France emit 77 times less carbon per passenger on journeys of this length.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
While this bill faces an uphill battle as it needs to pass through the more conservative French

39
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,080
Senate before enactment, it's no wonder why similar measures have been seriously considered

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,120
or implemented in the Belgian region of Wallonia, Austria, the Netherlands, and by countless

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,640
employers globally. The problem for airlines is that they just don't have any good arguments

42
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,560
against regulations like these. A move away from the shortest-haul, most replaceable flights will

43
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,560
be the start, but it won't end there. As one of the more carbon-intensive industries, airlines

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,400
will face increasing regulatory barriers to their operations—unless, of course, flying becomes less

45
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,760
carbon-intensive. Flying must happen, in many cases. Governments will not ban flying full stop.

46
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,800
Governments will not heavily restrict flying, but governments will make it so that the externality—the

47
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,720
carbon footprint—is priced in to the cost of flying. That is, governments will create

48
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,600
structures in which greener flying is cheaper flying with, for example, hefty carbon taxes.

49
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,560
So, why airlines care about climate change is because airlines are pragmatic, and it's quickly

50
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,000
and increasingly becoming the case that competitiveness as companies is linked to how

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,200
green they are. Biofuels, engine efficiency improvements, carbon offsetting—these things

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,000
all help, but they're incremental changes that can only take flying from being incredibly

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,440
carbon-intense to very carbon-intense. However, there is one solution that can actually,

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,240
realistically turn flying into a somewhat sustainable method of transport—electric

55
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:23,600
aircraft. Now, here's the thing. Electric aircraft are no massive innovation. They

56
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,080
existed in 1973 when the MBE-1 became the first to fly with a human crew, they existed in 2015

57
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,360
when the Solar Impulse 2 circumnavigated the world exclusively on solar power, and they existed in

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,560
2020 when the Papistrel Velis Electro became the first commercially available type-rated electric

59
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,920
powered aircraft. There's not a whole lot technologically that has or is preventing

60
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,360
electric aircraft from existing. What is, is the business case. Batteries are just more expensive,

61
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,800
and less energy-dense than fuel, so with carbon emissions always having been free for airlines,

62
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,480
it just always made sense to use petroleum-based fuel. Aircraft development is an unbelievably

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,640
expensive endeavor, and getting an aircraft certified for commercial use using a new type

64
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,680
of motor is just all that much more, so it never made sense for a manufacturer to go through all

65
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,680
that for an aircraft that didn't have a strong business case. Now, however, for the first time

66
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,320
ever, a strong hypothesis of a business case has developed, and, if it works,

67
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,600
we will see the most dramatic shift in how commercial aircraft work in generations.

68
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,560
Electric aircraft inherently have constraints. While much progress has been made in the past

69
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,360
decade to bring down the price of batteries, and they now cost one tenth as much per kilowatt hour

70
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,880
compared to a decade ago, less has been done to increase battery energy density—that is,

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,720
the amount of electricity stored per pound or kilogram. That's because, with electric vehicles,

72
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,040
the primary novel application, weight doesn't matter that much. It's easier to increase range

73
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,080
by bringing down cost and putting more batteries in than improving their energy density. It's

74
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,520
different with aircraft. The lighter they are, the further they can fly, so there are diminishing

75
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,320
returns in adding additional batteries since doing so means one needs to add even more batteries to

76
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,480
provide the energy to carry the weight of those batteries, and so on and so forth. Also, for now,

77
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,520
all viable electric aircraft are propeller-driven, specifically because it would be far more costly

78
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,160
to develop an electric jet engine, and the time savings it would offer on the short-range flights

79
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,200
that electric aircraft would be capable of completing would be negligible. So, airlines

80
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:45,760
need to find a use case for short-range, slow, electric aircraft. Conveniently, it already exists.

81
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,200
From their Denver, Colorado hub, United Airlines flies to 16 destinations less than 250 miles or

82
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,040
400 kilometers away. In particular in this case, many of these destinations, such as Montrose,

83
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,480
Aspen, Eagle County, and Hayden, are high-yield and high-frequency despite their close distance

84
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,040
since they connect tourists to popular ski towns. In the case of Wiederau, a Norwegian

85
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,880
regional airline, 19 of their 47 overall destinations are within 250 miles of their

86
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,680
Tromsø hub, and a strong majority of their routes are over distances less than this.

87
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:27,680
Then, there are airlines like Cape Air, who do not fly a single route over 250 miles in length.

88
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,920
The use case for electric aircraft already exists because airlines like Cape Air already found it—just

89
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:40,400
not yet using electric aircraft. They fly from large hubs to small destinations on 9-seat

90
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,200
propeller aircraft, and partner with mainline airlines to offer connecting itineraries.

91
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,240
For them, the electric aircraft range constraints don't matter since all their routes are so short,

92
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,280
and therefore the speed constraints don't either. When Cape Air flies from Martha's Vineyard to New

93
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,400
York JFK on their propeller-driven Cessna 402, the flight takes an average of 70 minutes,

94
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:07,120
whereas Delta, flying the same route using a jet CRJ200, takes 45. When Cape Air flies from

95
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,440
Nantucket to Boston Logan Airport, they take 39 minutes, whereas JetBlue, on their E190 aircraft,

96
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,160
takes 28. Those extra 11 or 25 minutes are negligible in the overall travel experience,

97
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,720
especially considering that Cape Air's boarding times, with 9 passengers, are certainly quicker

98
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,320
than with Delta's 50 passengers or JetBlue's 100. So, not only could electric aircraft

99
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,960
seamlessly replace all of Cape Air's flights, but they could also take over some of Delta,

100
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,880
JetBlue, United, or other larger airlines' routes without a negative impact to overall trip time.

101
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,000
So, the use case exists, passengers would accept the switch, but what do electric

102
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,560
aircraft do for airlines, aside from enabling a continuation of operations in the face of

103
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,040
increasing regulation? A very specific answer for this exists, thanks to one short document.

104
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,640
This is the US Department of Transportation's Order Reselecting Airline document for their

105
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,680
essential air service subsidized flights from Boston Logan Airport to Augusta and Rockland,

106
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,800
Maine. You see, the US government subsidizes routes to these small, remote communities

107
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,280
across the country in order to improve connectivity and economic opportunity for

108
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,200
these areas. As it's the US taxpayer funding these programs, the bids from airlines to operate these

109
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,920
routes are a matter of public record, providing a truly unique glimpse into accurate operating

110
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,920
costs for a single airline route. While they competed against Boutique Air, Cape Air ended

111
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,600
up winning the bid so they now operate the route to Rockland, Maine. In exchange, they received a

112
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:49,680
subsidy of $2,218,126 for their first year, 2018-2019, ramping up to $2,495,090 by their

113
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,200
fourth. Rockland is a tourist hotspot in the summer, but it returns to a quieter state for

114
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
the rest of the year, so the airline's obligations for flight frequency varies by the season—

115
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,600
anywhere between three daily round-trip flights in winter to six in the summer. All in all, though,

116
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,640
they're obligated to operate some 1,365 flights annually, representing 12,285 total available

117
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,480
passenger seats in each direction. According to Cape Air's estimates, this route should cost some

118
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:27,360
$3,350,746 a year to operate. They estimated some 15,122 total passengers would fly,

119
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,920
but publicly available data shows that only 6,733 boarded their planes in Rockland in 2019.

120
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,440
Assuming it's roughly the same in the other direction, as one would expect,

121
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:45,360
that means they saw only 13,466 total passengers, representing a 54.8% load factor.

122
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,400
Selling tickets for an average of $83, the airline likely therefore brought in $1,117,678

123
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,720
in passenger revenue which, combined with their $2,247,721 year-two subsidy,

124
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:06,000
means they earned some $3,365,399 in revenue. Subtracting their annual cost estimates,

125
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,200
that means they only turned $14,653 in profit, or $1.09 worth per passenger.

126
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,640
This is how tight airline profit margins can be. But what would they be if this route was operated

127
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:29,840
by an electric airplane? Well, to start, fuel costs would be almost entirely eliminated.

128
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,120
Electricity isn't free, but its costs are so low compared to fuel that it essentially becomes a

129
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,640
non-factor. Electricity can also be converted into a capital cost, instead of ongoing cost,

130
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:46,160
through investing in solar or wind energy generation, which Cape Air has hinted at doing.

131
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,760
So, this $844,002 in annual fuel costs, we can consider it, for all intents and purposes,

132
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,640
eliminated. Other costs would go up. Cape Air budgets $269,903 per year on ownership costs,

133
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,560
meaning the amortized, prorated cost of owning their aircraft. While details are not known,

134
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,160
and so an accurate estimate would be impossible, there's no world in which a new, electric aircraft

135
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,920
is cheaper than the mass-produced, long-proven Cessna 402. It wouldn't be unreasonable to expect

136
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,320
that ownership costs would, say, double. Then, there are the maintenance costs. These would be

137
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,680
significantly lower than with traditional internal combustion-driven aircraft. The thing is,

138
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,240
electric motors are just so simple. They have exactly one moving part—the shaft.

139
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,480
Electric vehicles typically never require motor maintenance, as there's really just

140
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,440
nothing that can break or wear down within their lifetimes. The same principle will apply to

141
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,400
electric airplanes, and so much of the maintenance work aircraft require currently is on their

142
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,440
engines. While it's very tough to know with any confidence how this will play out in reality with

143
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,640
planes that don't yet exist, there's a world in which aircraft maintenance would cost a fraction

144
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,720
as much. Overall, these three factors combined—a near total elimination of fuel costs,

145
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,920
a dramatic increase in ownership costs, and a dramatic decrease in maintenance costs—track

146
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:22,800
with Cape Air's estimates for a 40% reduction in operating costs. That is enormous. On their

147
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,440
Rockland route, assuming no change in revenue, that would take $1.09 in per passenger profit,

148
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:38,320
and turn it into $100.62—a number so dramatically different that it doesn't even sound correct.

149
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,360
This would immediately turn Cape Air into the highest operating margin airline in the world,

150
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,600
full stop. This is why the future of short-haul flying is inevitably electric.

151
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,520
This is why, in 2019, Cape Air became the first commercial customer to order the Alice,

152
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,320
a nine-passenger electric aircraft developed by startup aircraft manufacturer,

153
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,880
Eviation. It will be able to fly each and every one of the airline's routes round-trip without

154
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,600
charging. There are certainly no guarantees that the Alice will see the light of day—aircraft

155
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,240
development is an incredibly costly, risky, and long process that can spell failure for

156
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,080
even the strongest concepts—but everything so far suggests that Eviation has just as much

157
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:32,160
a shot at success as all the other players that have entered this race. While Cape Air may be

158
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
pioneering the use of these aircraft in the commercial context, as they have the advantage

159
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,160
of a pre-existing route network and business strategy that are conducive to their use,

160
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:46,080
the release of such aircraft will fundamentally break a long-held truth about aviation.

161
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,600
Short-haul flying is currently more expensive per mile than long-haul flying, due to the high

162
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,520
fixed costs involved with the ground operations at each airport. However, with electric aircraft

163
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,160
available exclusively on shorter routes, at least in the near future, there's a reality in which

164
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:09,440
it's cheaper per mile to fly 200 miles than 2,000 miles. That will shift airlines' focus to more

165
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,400
regional route networks and connect communities that previously were too small to make economic

166
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,320
sense for airlines. In short, not only will electric aircraft allow airlines to continue

167
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:26,640
to operate short-haul as regulations ramp up, but it will allow them to increase it in a sustainable,

168
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,400
profitable way. The future of flying is inevitably electric, because the business case

169
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:40,240
is just too strong to ignore. Plenty of progress has already been made to make electric flying a

170
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,640
reality, and as much as I'd like to tell you in detail about the specific electric aircraft that

171
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,400
you might fly in a matter of years, and how they work, there just isn't the time in this video.

172
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,680
The YouTube algorithm has just decided that 15 to 20 minutes is our sweet spot for video length,

173
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,880
and if we stray from that, the videos don't perform well. Conveniently, though,

174
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,640
Nebula doesn't have an algorithm. So, I created a companion video to this about that topic,

175
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,000
and put it there. Nebula subscribers can watch that, our regular videos early and ad-free,

176
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,400
other exclusive companion videos and extended cuts, and our big-budget Nebula originals,

177
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,040
of which we have plenty, and we have our biggest one yet in post-production right now.

178
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,360
Making that even better, you can get access to Nebula through the bundle deal with Curiosity

179
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:31,520
Stream, which is on sale for Father's Day at its lowest ever pricing of under $1 per month.

180
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,200
Of course, by signing up through them, you also get access to their massive,

181
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
super-interesting library of non-fiction documentaries and shows. For example,

182
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,080
and I've recommended this before because it's so good, you could watch China's Last Little Train,

183
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,800
about the narrow gauge railway that connects one of China's most isolated regions. Altogether,

184
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,200
this bundle provides a massive amount of stuff that you'll actually watch, and it comes at an

185
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,600
absurdly low price. Again, the current Father's Day sale is the lowest their prices have ever been—just

186
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,720
under $1 a month—so there has never been a better time to sign up at CuriosityStream.com

187
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,440
slash Wendover, and, best of all, you'll be helping all these independent creators

188
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,840
stay independent while you're at it.
