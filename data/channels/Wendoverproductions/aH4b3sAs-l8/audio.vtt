00:14.160 --> 00:21.520
Airlines are pragmatic. Each, inherently, is a sizable organization, as a degree of scale is

00:21.520 --> 00:27.760
necessary due to the massive capital costs needed to, quite literally, get a plane off the ground.

00:27.760 --> 00:34.400
There are no mom and pop airlines. Therefore, airlines have the resources to analyze choices

00:34.400 --> 00:39.840
to a far greater level of detail than most businesses. Any decision that we, the public,

00:39.840 --> 00:46.400
see has passed through such a level of review, such a level of scrutiny, that it must mean

00:46.400 --> 00:52.000
something. Airlines typically don't make emotional, informal, or off-the-cuff decisions.

00:52.560 --> 00:58.960
Therefore, it's odd how much airlines care about climate change because, from a theoretical

00:58.960 --> 01:06.000
perspective, they shouldn't. It doesn't currently make sense for airlines to care about climate

01:06.000 --> 01:12.720
change. Of course, from a moral perspective it does, but businesses, traditionally and theoretically,

01:12.720 --> 01:18.720
don't value morality higher than profit. That's the role of non-profits—the organizational

01:18.720 --> 01:24.160
structure designed to value social impact first and foremost. For-profit businesses,

01:24.160 --> 01:30.800
in the traditional sense, are designed for profit. Therefore, properly managed, they do what

01:30.800 --> 01:37.440
generates the most profit, and for airlines, right now, what enables that is to not care about

01:37.440 --> 01:43.760
climate change. Carbon doesn't have a cost for airlines. With a few exceptions, emitting more

01:43.760 --> 01:48.560
carbon does not cost the airlines anything, but it enables them to make more profit,

01:48.560 --> 01:53.360
so the theoretically correct thing for airlines to do is to emit the amount of carbon that enables

01:53.360 --> 01:58.960
them to generate the most profit regardless of environmental consequences. Some say airlines

01:58.960 --> 02:04.000
care about climate change for public relations, and they're right, but only to an extent.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.920
Airlines clearly posture as caring about their carbon footprint because consumers

02:07.920 --> 02:12.800
increasingly care about their carbon footprint, so being viewed as a greener airline translates

02:12.800 --> 02:18.160
to being a more desirable choice for consumers, who, unlike for-profit businesses, do care about

02:18.160 --> 02:24.880
what's morally right to an extent. However, net carbon zero is expensive, biofuel development is

02:24.880 --> 02:29.600
expensive, sustainable aircraft development is expensive—all more expensive than would make

02:29.600 --> 02:35.200
sense if airlines and aircraft developers exclusively cared about PR. So, the reason

02:35.200 --> 02:41.520
why airlines are starting to care about climate change is because they're terrified of the R-word.

02:42.080 --> 02:48.320
Regulation. It started already. In France, the National Assembly has passed a bill that would

02:48.320 --> 02:53.200
ban short-haul flights on routes that could be traveled in two and a half hours or less by train.

02:53.200 --> 03:00.560
Here's the worst thing for airlines. Measures like this make absolute perfect sense. With airports

03:00.560 --> 03:06.080
located away from city centers, security lines, less reliable departure times, and more, no journey

03:06.080 --> 03:10.640
that would take two and a half hours by train could reasonably and reliably be accomplished

03:10.640 --> 03:15.040
faster by plane. The bill would still allow the shorter flights to operate for the purposes of

03:15.040 --> 03:20.560
connections to longer-haul flights, but passengers just couldn't book the short flights by themselves.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.680
So, there's no real downside, but there's the massive upside of shifting travelers onto trains,

03:25.680 --> 03:31.520
which in the case of France emit 77 times less carbon per passenger on journeys of this length.

03:31.520 --> 03:35.520
While this bill faces an uphill battle as it needs to pass through the more conservative French

03:35.520 --> 03:40.080
Senate before enactment, it's no wonder why similar measures have been seriously considered

03:40.080 --> 03:45.120
or implemented in the Belgian region of Wallonia, Austria, the Netherlands, and by countless

03:45.120 --> 03:50.640
employers globally. The problem for airlines is that they just don't have any good arguments

03:50.640 --> 03:56.560
against regulations like these. A move away from the shortest-haul, most replaceable flights will

03:56.560 --> 04:02.560
be the start, but it won't end there. As one of the more carbon-intensive industries, airlines

04:02.560 --> 04:10.400
will face increasing regulatory barriers to their operations—unless, of course, flying becomes less

04:10.400 --> 04:19.760
carbon-intensive. Flying must happen, in many cases. Governments will not ban flying full stop.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.800
Governments will not heavily restrict flying, but governments will make it so that the externality—the

04:24.800 --> 04:30.720
carbon footprint—is priced in to the cost of flying. That is, governments will create

04:30.720 --> 04:37.600
structures in which greener flying is cheaper flying with, for example, hefty carbon taxes.

04:38.160 --> 04:44.560
So, why airlines care about climate change is because airlines are pragmatic, and it's quickly

04:44.560 --> 04:50.000
and increasingly becoming the case that competitiveness as companies is linked to how

04:50.000 --> 04:57.200
green they are. Biofuels, engine efficiency improvements, carbon offsetting—these things

04:57.200 --> 05:02.000
all help, but they're incremental changes that can only take flying from being incredibly

05:02.000 --> 05:09.440
carbon-intense to very carbon-intense. However, there is one solution that can actually,

05:09.440 --> 05:16.240
realistically turn flying into a somewhat sustainable method of transport—electric

05:16.240 --> 05:23.600
aircraft. Now, here's the thing. Electric aircraft are no massive innovation. They

05:23.600 --> 05:30.080
existed in 1973 when the MBE-1 became the first to fly with a human crew, they existed in 2015

05:30.080 --> 05:35.360
when the Solar Impulse 2 circumnavigated the world exclusively on solar power, and they existed in

05:35.360 --> 05:40.560
2020 when the Papistrel Velis Electro became the first commercially available type-rated electric

05:40.560 --> 05:45.920
powered aircraft. There's not a whole lot technologically that has or is preventing

05:45.920 --> 05:53.360
electric aircraft from existing. What is, is the business case. Batteries are just more expensive,

05:53.360 --> 05:58.800
and less energy-dense than fuel, so with carbon emissions always having been free for airlines,

05:58.800 --> 06:04.480
it just always made sense to use petroleum-based fuel. Aircraft development is an unbelievably

06:04.480 --> 06:08.640
expensive endeavor, and getting an aircraft certified for commercial use using a new type

06:08.640 --> 06:13.680
of motor is just all that much more, so it never made sense for a manufacturer to go through all

06:13.680 --> 06:19.680
that for an aircraft that didn't have a strong business case. Now, however, for the first time

06:19.680 --> 06:26.320
ever, a strong hypothesis of a business case has developed, and, if it works,

06:26.320 --> 06:31.600
we will see the most dramatic shift in how commercial aircraft work in generations.

06:32.400 --> 06:38.560
Electric aircraft inherently have constraints. While much progress has been made in the past

06:38.560 --> 06:43.360
decade to bring down the price of batteries, and they now cost one tenth as much per kilowatt hour

06:43.360 --> 06:48.880
compared to a decade ago, less has been done to increase battery energy density—that is,

06:48.880 --> 06:54.720
the amount of electricity stored per pound or kilogram. That's because, with electric vehicles,

06:54.720 --> 07:01.040
the primary novel application, weight doesn't matter that much. It's easier to increase range

07:01.040 --> 07:06.080
by bringing down cost and putting more batteries in than improving their energy density. It's

07:06.080 --> 07:11.520
different with aircraft. The lighter they are, the further they can fly, so there are diminishing

07:11.520 --> 07:16.320
returns in adding additional batteries since doing so means one needs to add even more batteries to

07:16.320 --> 07:22.480
provide the energy to carry the weight of those batteries, and so on and so forth. Also, for now,

07:22.480 --> 07:27.520
all viable electric aircraft are propeller-driven, specifically because it would be far more costly

07:27.520 --> 07:32.160
to develop an electric jet engine, and the time savings it would offer on the short-range flights

07:32.160 --> 07:37.200
that electric aircraft would be capable of completing would be negligible. So, airlines

07:37.200 --> 07:45.760
need to find a use case for short-range, slow, electric aircraft. Conveniently, it already exists.

07:46.880 --> 07:53.200
From their Denver, Colorado hub, United Airlines flies to 16 destinations less than 250 miles or

07:53.200 --> 07:59.040
400 kilometers away. In particular in this case, many of these destinations, such as Montrose,

07:59.040 --> 08:04.480
Aspen, Eagle County, and Hayden, are high-yield and high-frequency despite their close distance

08:04.480 --> 08:09.040
since they connect tourists to popular ski towns. In the case of Wiederau, a Norwegian

08:09.040 --> 08:14.880
regional airline, 19 of their 47 overall destinations are within 250 miles of their

08:14.880 --> 08:19.680
Tromsø hub, and a strong majority of their routes are over distances less than this.

08:20.320 --> 08:27.680
Then, there are airlines like Cape Air, who do not fly a single route over 250 miles in length.

08:27.680 --> 08:33.920
The use case for electric aircraft already exists because airlines like Cape Air already found it—just

08:33.920 --> 08:40.400
not yet using electric aircraft. They fly from large hubs to small destinations on 9-seat

08:40.400 --> 08:45.200
propeller aircraft, and partner with mainline airlines to offer connecting itineraries.

08:45.200 --> 08:50.240
For them, the electric aircraft range constraints don't matter since all their routes are so short,

08:50.240 --> 08:55.280
and therefore the speed constraints don't either. When Cape Air flies from Martha's Vineyard to New

08:55.280 --> 09:00.400
York JFK on their propeller-driven Cessna 402, the flight takes an average of 70 minutes,

09:00.400 --> 09:07.120
whereas Delta, flying the same route using a jet CRJ200, takes 45. When Cape Air flies from

09:07.120 --> 09:13.440
Nantucket to Boston Logan Airport, they take 39 minutes, whereas JetBlue, on their E190 aircraft,

09:13.440 --> 09:20.160
takes 28. Those extra 11 or 25 minutes are negligible in the overall travel experience,

09:20.160 --> 09:24.720
especially considering that Cape Air's boarding times, with 9 passengers, are certainly quicker

09:24.720 --> 09:30.320
than with Delta's 50 passengers or JetBlue's 100. So, not only could electric aircraft

09:30.320 --> 09:34.960
seamlessly replace all of Cape Air's flights, but they could also take over some of Delta,

09:34.960 --> 09:40.880
JetBlue, United, or other larger airlines' routes without a negative impact to overall trip time.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.000
So, the use case exists, passengers would accept the switch, but what do electric

09:46.000 --> 09:50.560
aircraft do for airlines, aside from enabling a continuation of operations in the face of

09:50.560 --> 09:57.040
increasing regulation? A very specific answer for this exists, thanks to one short document.

09:57.760 --> 10:02.640
This is the US Department of Transportation's Order Reselecting Airline document for their

10:02.640 --> 10:07.680
essential air service subsidized flights from Boston Logan Airport to Augusta and Rockland,

10:07.680 --> 10:12.800
Maine. You see, the US government subsidizes routes to these small, remote communities

10:12.800 --> 10:17.280
across the country in order to improve connectivity and economic opportunity for

10:17.280 --> 10:23.200
these areas. As it's the US taxpayer funding these programs, the bids from airlines to operate these

10:23.200 --> 10:27.920
routes are a matter of public record, providing a truly unique glimpse into accurate operating

10:27.920 --> 10:33.920
costs for a single airline route. While they competed against Boutique Air, Cape Air ended

10:33.920 --> 10:39.600
up winning the bid so they now operate the route to Rockland, Maine. In exchange, they received a

10:39.600 --> 10:49.680
subsidy of $2,218,126 for their first year, 2018-2019, ramping up to $2,495,090 by their

10:49.680 --> 10:55.200
fourth. Rockland is a tourist hotspot in the summer, but it returns to a quieter state for

10:55.200 --> 11:00.000
the rest of the year, so the airline's obligations for flight frequency varies by the season—

11:00.000 --> 11:05.600
anywhere between three daily round-trip flights in winter to six in the summer. All in all, though,

11:05.600 --> 11:12.640
they're obligated to operate some 1,365 flights annually, representing 12,285 total available

11:12.640 --> 11:18.480
passenger seats in each direction. According to Cape Air's estimates, this route should cost some

11:18.560 --> 11:27.360
$3,350,746 a year to operate. They estimated some 15,122 total passengers would fly,

11:27.360 --> 11:33.920
but publicly available data shows that only 6,733 boarded their planes in Rockland in 2019.

11:33.920 --> 11:37.440
Assuming it's roughly the same in the other direction, as one would expect,

11:37.440 --> 11:45.360
that means they saw only 13,466 total passengers, representing a 54.8% load factor.

11:45.360 --> 11:52.400
Selling tickets for an average of $83, the airline likely therefore brought in $1,117,678

11:52.400 --> 11:58.720
in passenger revenue which, combined with their $2,247,721 year-two subsidy,

11:58.720 --> 12:06.000
means they earned some $3,365,399 in revenue. Subtracting their annual cost estimates,

12:06.000 --> 12:15.200
that means they only turned $14,653 in profit, or $1.09 worth per passenger.

12:15.760 --> 12:22.640
This is how tight airline profit margins can be. But what would they be if this route was operated

12:22.640 --> 12:29.840
by an electric airplane? Well, to start, fuel costs would be almost entirely eliminated.

12:29.840 --> 12:35.120
Electricity isn't free, but its costs are so low compared to fuel that it essentially becomes a

12:35.120 --> 12:40.640
non-factor. Electricity can also be converted into a capital cost, instead of ongoing cost,

12:40.640 --> 12:46.160
through investing in solar or wind energy generation, which Cape Air has hinted at doing.

12:46.160 --> 12:53.760
So, this $844,002 in annual fuel costs, we can consider it, for all intents and purposes,

12:53.760 --> 13:02.640
eliminated. Other costs would go up. Cape Air budgets $269,903 per year on ownership costs,

13:02.640 --> 13:08.560
meaning the amortized, prorated cost of owning their aircraft. While details are not known,

13:08.560 --> 13:14.160
and so an accurate estimate would be impossible, there's no world in which a new, electric aircraft

13:14.160 --> 13:19.920
is cheaper than the mass-produced, long-proven Cessna 402. It wouldn't be unreasonable to expect

13:19.920 --> 13:26.320
that ownership costs would, say, double. Then, there are the maintenance costs. These would be

13:26.320 --> 13:31.680
significantly lower than with traditional internal combustion-driven aircraft. The thing is,

13:31.680 --> 13:38.240
electric motors are just so simple. They have exactly one moving part—the shaft.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.480
Electric vehicles typically never require motor maintenance, as there's really just

13:42.480 --> 13:47.440
nothing that can break or wear down within their lifetimes. The same principle will apply to

13:47.440 --> 13:52.400
electric airplanes, and so much of the maintenance work aircraft require currently is on their

13:52.400 --> 13:57.440
engines. While it's very tough to know with any confidence how this will play out in reality with

13:57.440 --> 14:02.640
planes that don't yet exist, there's a world in which aircraft maintenance would cost a fraction

14:02.640 --> 14:08.720
as much. Overall, these three factors combined—a near total elimination of fuel costs,

14:08.720 --> 14:13.920
a dramatic increase in ownership costs, and a dramatic decrease in maintenance costs—track

14:13.920 --> 14:22.800
with Cape Air's estimates for a 40% reduction in operating costs. That is enormous. On their

14:22.800 --> 14:29.440
Rockland route, assuming no change in revenue, that would take $1.09 in per passenger profit,

14:29.440 --> 14:38.320
and turn it into $100.62—a number so dramatically different that it doesn't even sound correct.

14:39.040 --> 14:45.360
This would immediately turn Cape Air into the highest operating margin airline in the world,

14:45.360 --> 14:51.600
full stop. This is why the future of short-haul flying is inevitably electric.

14:52.320 --> 14:59.520
This is why, in 2019, Cape Air became the first commercial customer to order the Alice,

14:59.520 --> 15:04.320
a nine-passenger electric aircraft developed by startup aircraft manufacturer,

15:04.320 --> 15:10.880
Eviation. It will be able to fly each and every one of the airline's routes round-trip without

15:10.880 --> 15:15.600
charging. There are certainly no guarantees that the Alice will see the light of day—aircraft

15:15.600 --> 15:20.240
development is an incredibly costly, risky, and long process that can spell failure for

15:20.240 --> 15:26.080
even the strongest concepts—but everything so far suggests that Eviation has just as much

15:26.080 --> 15:32.160
a shot at success as all the other players that have entered this race. While Cape Air may be

15:32.160 --> 15:36.240
pioneering the use of these aircraft in the commercial context, as they have the advantage

15:36.240 --> 15:40.160
of a pre-existing route network and business strategy that are conducive to their use,

15:40.160 --> 15:46.080
the release of such aircraft will fundamentally break a long-held truth about aviation.

15:46.080 --> 15:51.600
Short-haul flying is currently more expensive per mile than long-haul flying, due to the high

15:51.600 --> 15:57.520
fixed costs involved with the ground operations at each airport. However, with electric aircraft

15:57.520 --> 16:02.160
available exclusively on shorter routes, at least in the near future, there's a reality in which

16:02.160 --> 16:09.440
it's cheaper per mile to fly 200 miles than 2,000 miles. That will shift airlines' focus to more

16:09.440 --> 16:14.400
regional route networks and connect communities that previously were too small to make economic

16:14.400 --> 16:20.320
sense for airlines. In short, not only will electric aircraft allow airlines to continue

16:20.320 --> 16:26.640
to operate short-haul as regulations ramp up, but it will allow them to increase it in a sustainable,

16:26.640 --> 16:32.400
profitable way. The future of flying is inevitably electric, because the business case

16:32.960 --> 16:40.240
is just too strong to ignore. Plenty of progress has already been made to make electric flying a

16:40.240 --> 16:44.640
reality, and as much as I'd like to tell you in detail about the specific electric aircraft that

16:44.640 --> 16:50.400
you might fly in a matter of years, and how they work, there just isn't the time in this video.

16:50.400 --> 16:55.680
The YouTube algorithm has just decided that 15 to 20 minutes is our sweet spot for video length,

16:55.680 --> 17:00.880
and if we stray from that, the videos don't perform well. Conveniently, though,

17:00.880 --> 17:06.640
Nebula doesn't have an algorithm. So, I created a companion video to this about that topic,

17:06.640 --> 17:12.000
and put it there. Nebula subscribers can watch that, our regular videos early and ad-free,

17:12.000 --> 17:16.400
other exclusive companion videos and extended cuts, and our big-budget Nebula originals,

17:16.400 --> 17:21.040
of which we have plenty, and we have our biggest one yet in post-production right now.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.360
Making that even better, you can get access to Nebula through the bundle deal with Curiosity

17:25.360 --> 17:31.520
Stream, which is on sale for Father's Day at its lowest ever pricing of under $1 per month.

17:31.520 --> 17:35.200
Of course, by signing up through them, you also get access to their massive,

17:35.200 --> 17:39.520
super-interesting library of non-fiction documentaries and shows. For example,

17:39.520 --> 17:44.080
and I've recommended this before because it's so good, you could watch China's Last Little Train,

17:44.080 --> 17:48.800
about the narrow gauge railway that connects one of China's most isolated regions. Altogether,
