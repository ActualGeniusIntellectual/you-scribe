14160	21520	Airlines are pragmatic. Each, inherently, is a sizable organization, as a degree of scale is
21520	27760	necessary due to the massive capital costs needed to, quite literally, get a plane off the ground.
27760	34400	There are no mom and pop airlines. Therefore, airlines have the resources to analyze choices
34400	39840	to a far greater level of detail than most businesses. Any decision that we, the public,
39840	46400	see has passed through such a level of review, such a level of scrutiny, that it must mean
46400	52000	something. Airlines typically don't make emotional, informal, or off-the-cuff decisions.
52560	58960	Therefore, it's odd how much airlines care about climate change because, from a theoretical
58960	66000	perspective, they shouldn't. It doesn't currently make sense for airlines to care about climate
66000	72720	change. Of course, from a moral perspective it does, but businesses, traditionally and theoretically,
72720	78720	don't value morality higher than profit. That's the role of non-profits—the organizational
78720	84160	structure designed to value social impact first and foremost. For-profit businesses,
84160	90800	in the traditional sense, are designed for profit. Therefore, properly managed, they do what
90800	97440	generates the most profit, and for airlines, right now, what enables that is to not care about
97440	103760	climate change. Carbon doesn't have a cost for airlines. With a few exceptions, emitting more
103760	108560	carbon does not cost the airlines anything, but it enables them to make more profit,
108560	113360	so the theoretically correct thing for airlines to do is to emit the amount of carbon that enables
113360	118960	them to generate the most profit regardless of environmental consequences. Some say airlines
118960	124000	care about climate change for public relations, and they're right, but only to an extent.
124000	127920	Airlines clearly posture as caring about their carbon footprint because consumers
127920	132800	increasingly care about their carbon footprint, so being viewed as a greener airline translates
132800	138160	to being a more desirable choice for consumers, who, unlike for-profit businesses, do care about
138160	144880	what's morally right to an extent. However, net carbon zero is expensive, biofuel development is
144880	149600	expensive, sustainable aircraft development is expensive—all more expensive than would make
149600	155200	sense if airlines and aircraft developers exclusively cared about PR. So, the reason
155200	161520	why airlines are starting to care about climate change is because they're terrified of the R-word.
162080	168320	Regulation. It started already. In France, the National Assembly has passed a bill that would
168320	173200	ban short-haul flights on routes that could be traveled in two and a half hours or less by train.
173200	180560	Here's the worst thing for airlines. Measures like this make absolute perfect sense. With airports
180560	186080	located away from city centers, security lines, less reliable departure times, and more, no journey
186080	190640	that would take two and a half hours by train could reasonably and reliably be accomplished
190640	195040	faster by plane. The bill would still allow the shorter flights to operate for the purposes of
195040	200560	connections to longer-haul flights, but passengers just couldn't book the short flights by themselves.
200560	205680	So, there's no real downside, but there's the massive upside of shifting travelers onto trains,
205680	211520	which in the case of France emit 77 times less carbon per passenger on journeys of this length.
211520	215520	While this bill faces an uphill battle as it needs to pass through the more conservative French
215520	220080	Senate before enactment, it's no wonder why similar measures have been seriously considered
220080	225120	or implemented in the Belgian region of Wallonia, Austria, the Netherlands, and by countless
225120	230640	employers globally. The problem for airlines is that they just don't have any good arguments
230640	236560	against regulations like these. A move away from the shortest-haul, most replaceable flights will
236560	242560	be the start, but it won't end there. As one of the more carbon-intensive industries, airlines
242560	250400	will face increasing regulatory barriers to their operations—unless, of course, flying becomes less
250400	259760	carbon-intensive. Flying must happen, in many cases. Governments will not ban flying full stop.
259760	264800	Governments will not heavily restrict flying, but governments will make it so that the externality—the
264800	270720	carbon footprint—is priced in to the cost of flying. That is, governments will create
270720	277600	structures in which greener flying is cheaper flying with, for example, hefty carbon taxes.
278160	284560	So, why airlines care about climate change is because airlines are pragmatic, and it's quickly
284560	290000	and increasingly becoming the case that competitiveness as companies is linked to how
290000	297200	green they are. Biofuels, engine efficiency improvements, carbon offsetting—these things
297200	302000	all help, but they're incremental changes that can only take flying from being incredibly
302000	309440	carbon-intense to very carbon-intense. However, there is one solution that can actually,
309440	316240	realistically turn flying into a somewhat sustainable method of transport—electric
316240	323600	aircraft. Now, here's the thing. Electric aircraft are no massive innovation. They
323600	330080	existed in 1973 when the MBE-1 became the first to fly with a human crew, they existed in 2015
330080	335360	when the Solar Impulse 2 circumnavigated the world exclusively on solar power, and they existed in
335360	340560	2020 when the Papistrel Velis Electro became the first commercially available type-rated electric
340560	345920	powered aircraft. There's not a whole lot technologically that has or is preventing
345920	353360	electric aircraft from existing. What is, is the business case. Batteries are just more expensive,
353360	358800	and less energy-dense than fuel, so with carbon emissions always having been free for airlines,
358800	364480	it just always made sense to use petroleum-based fuel. Aircraft development is an unbelievably
364480	368640	expensive endeavor, and getting an aircraft certified for commercial use using a new type
368640	373680	of motor is just all that much more, so it never made sense for a manufacturer to go through all
373680	379680	that for an aircraft that didn't have a strong business case. Now, however, for the first time
379680	386320	ever, a strong hypothesis of a business case has developed, and, if it works,
386320	391600	we will see the most dramatic shift in how commercial aircraft work in generations.
392400	398560	Electric aircraft inherently have constraints. While much progress has been made in the past
398560	403360	decade to bring down the price of batteries, and they now cost one tenth as much per kilowatt hour
403360	408880	compared to a decade ago, less has been done to increase battery energy density—that is,
408880	414720	the amount of electricity stored per pound or kilogram. That's because, with electric vehicles,
414720	421040	the primary novel application, weight doesn't matter that much. It's easier to increase range
421040	426080	by bringing down cost and putting more batteries in than improving their energy density. It's
426080	431520	different with aircraft. The lighter they are, the further they can fly, so there are diminishing
431520	436320	returns in adding additional batteries since doing so means one needs to add even more batteries to
436320	442480	provide the energy to carry the weight of those batteries, and so on and so forth. Also, for now,
442480	447520	all viable electric aircraft are propeller-driven, specifically because it would be far more costly
447520	452160	to develop an electric jet engine, and the time savings it would offer on the short-range flights
452160	457200	that electric aircraft would be capable of completing would be negligible. So, airlines
457200	465760	need to find a use case for short-range, slow, electric aircraft. Conveniently, it already exists.
466880	473200	From their Denver, Colorado hub, United Airlines flies to 16 destinations less than 250 miles or
473200	479040	400 kilometers away. In particular in this case, many of these destinations, such as Montrose,
479040	484480	Aspen, Eagle County, and Hayden, are high-yield and high-frequency despite their close distance
484480	489040	since they connect tourists to popular ski towns. In the case of Wiederau, a Norwegian
489040	494880	regional airline, 19 of their 47 overall destinations are within 250 miles of their
494880	499680	Tromsø hub, and a strong majority of their routes are over distances less than this.
500320	507680	Then, there are airlines like Cape Air, who do not fly a single route over 250 miles in length.
507680	513920	The use case for electric aircraft already exists because airlines like Cape Air already found it—just
513920	520400	not yet using electric aircraft. They fly from large hubs to small destinations on 9-seat
520400	525200	propeller aircraft, and partner with mainline airlines to offer connecting itineraries.
525200	530240	For them, the electric aircraft range constraints don't matter since all their routes are so short,
530240	535280	and therefore the speed constraints don't either. When Cape Air flies from Martha's Vineyard to New
535280	540400	York JFK on their propeller-driven Cessna 402, the flight takes an average of 70 minutes,
540400	547120	whereas Delta, flying the same route using a jet CRJ200, takes 45. When Cape Air flies from
547120	553440	Nantucket to Boston Logan Airport, they take 39 minutes, whereas JetBlue, on their E190 aircraft,
553440	560160	takes 28. Those extra 11 or 25 minutes are negligible in the overall travel experience,
560160	564720	especially considering that Cape Air's boarding times, with 9 passengers, are certainly quicker
564720	570320	than with Delta's 50 passengers or JetBlue's 100. So, not only could electric aircraft
570320	574960	seamlessly replace all of Cape Air's flights, but they could also take over some of Delta,
574960	580880	JetBlue, United, or other larger airlines' routes without a negative impact to overall trip time.
581520	586000	So, the use case exists, passengers would accept the switch, but what do electric
586000	590560	aircraft do for airlines, aside from enabling a continuation of operations in the face of
590560	597040	increasing regulation? A very specific answer for this exists, thanks to one short document.
597760	602640	This is the US Department of Transportation's Order Reselecting Airline document for their
602640	607680	essential air service subsidized flights from Boston Logan Airport to Augusta and Rockland,
607680	612800	Maine. You see, the US government subsidizes routes to these small, remote communities
612800	617280	across the country in order to improve connectivity and economic opportunity for
617280	623200	these areas. As it's the US taxpayer funding these programs, the bids from airlines to operate these
623200	627920	routes are a matter of public record, providing a truly unique glimpse into accurate operating
627920	633920	costs for a single airline route. While they competed against Boutique Air, Cape Air ended
633920	639600	up winning the bid so they now operate the route to Rockland, Maine. In exchange, they received a
639600	649680	subsidy of $2,218,126 for their first year, 2018-2019, ramping up to $2,495,090 by their
649680	655200	fourth. Rockland is a tourist hotspot in the summer, but it returns to a quieter state for
655200	660000	the rest of the year, so the airline's obligations for flight frequency varies by the season—
660000	665600	anywhere between three daily round-trip flights in winter to six in the summer. All in all, though,
665600	672640	they're obligated to operate some 1,365 flights annually, representing 12,285 total available
672640	678480	passenger seats in each direction. According to Cape Air's estimates, this route should cost some
678560	687360	$3,350,746 a year to operate. They estimated some 15,122 total passengers would fly,
687360	693920	but publicly available data shows that only 6,733 boarded their planes in Rockland in 2019.
693920	697440	Assuming it's roughly the same in the other direction, as one would expect,
697440	705360	that means they saw only 13,466 total passengers, representing a 54.8% load factor.
705360	712400	Selling tickets for an average of $83, the airline likely therefore brought in $1,117,678
712400	718720	in passenger revenue which, combined with their $2,247,721 year-two subsidy,
718720	726000	means they earned some $3,365,399 in revenue. Subtracting their annual cost estimates,
726000	735200	that means they only turned $14,653 in profit, or $1.09 worth per passenger.
735760	742640	This is how tight airline profit margins can be. But what would they be if this route was operated
742640	749840	by an electric airplane? Well, to start, fuel costs would be almost entirely eliminated.
749840	755120	Electricity isn't free, but its costs are so low compared to fuel that it essentially becomes a
755120	760640	non-factor. Electricity can also be converted into a capital cost, instead of ongoing cost,
760640	766160	through investing in solar or wind energy generation, which Cape Air has hinted at doing.
766160	773760	So, this $844,002 in annual fuel costs, we can consider it, for all intents and purposes,
773760	782640	eliminated. Other costs would go up. Cape Air budgets $269,903 per year on ownership costs,
782640	788560	meaning the amortized, prorated cost of owning their aircraft. While details are not known,
788560	794160	and so an accurate estimate would be impossible, there's no world in which a new, electric aircraft
794160	799920	is cheaper than the mass-produced, long-proven Cessna 402. It wouldn't be unreasonable to expect
799920	806320	that ownership costs would, say, double. Then, there are the maintenance costs. These would be
806320	811680	significantly lower than with traditional internal combustion-driven aircraft. The thing is,
811680	818240	electric motors are just so simple. They have exactly one moving part—the shaft.
818240	822480	Electric vehicles typically never require motor maintenance, as there's really just
822480	827440	nothing that can break or wear down within their lifetimes. The same principle will apply to
827440	832400	electric airplanes, and so much of the maintenance work aircraft require currently is on their
832400	837440	engines. While it's very tough to know with any confidence how this will play out in reality with
837440	842640	planes that don't yet exist, there's a world in which aircraft maintenance would cost a fraction
842640	848720	as much. Overall, these three factors combined—a near total elimination of fuel costs,
848720	853920	a dramatic increase in ownership costs, and a dramatic decrease in maintenance costs—track
853920	862800	with Cape Air's estimates for a 40% reduction in operating costs. That is enormous. On their
862800	869440	Rockland route, assuming no change in revenue, that would take $1.09 in per passenger profit,
869440	878320	and turn it into $100.62—a number so dramatically different that it doesn't even sound correct.
879040	885360	This would immediately turn Cape Air into the highest operating margin airline in the world,
885360	891600	full stop. This is why the future of short-haul flying is inevitably electric.
892320	899520	This is why, in 2019, Cape Air became the first commercial customer to order the Alice,
899520	904320	a nine-passenger electric aircraft developed by startup aircraft manufacturer,
904320	910880	Eviation. It will be able to fly each and every one of the airline's routes round-trip without
910880	915600	charging. There are certainly no guarantees that the Alice will see the light of day—aircraft
915600	920240	development is an incredibly costly, risky, and long process that can spell failure for
920240	926080	even the strongest concepts—but everything so far suggests that Eviation has just as much
926080	932160	a shot at success as all the other players that have entered this race. While Cape Air may be
932160	936240	pioneering the use of these aircraft in the commercial context, as they have the advantage
936240	940160	of a pre-existing route network and business strategy that are conducive to their use,
940160	946080	the release of such aircraft will fundamentally break a long-held truth about aviation.
946080	951600	Short-haul flying is currently more expensive per mile than long-haul flying, due to the high
951600	957520	fixed costs involved with the ground operations at each airport. However, with electric aircraft
957520	962160	available exclusively on shorter routes, at least in the near future, there's a reality in which
962160	969440	it's cheaper per mile to fly 200 miles than 2,000 miles. That will shift airlines' focus to more
969440	974400	regional route networks and connect communities that previously were too small to make economic
974400	980320	sense for airlines. In short, not only will electric aircraft allow airlines to continue
980320	986640	to operate short-haul as regulations ramp up, but it will allow them to increase it in a sustainable,
986640	992400	profitable way. The future of flying is inevitably electric, because the business case
992960	1000240	is just too strong to ignore. Plenty of progress has already been made to make electric flying a
1000240	1004640	reality, and as much as I'd like to tell you in detail about the specific electric aircraft that
1004640	1010400	you might fly in a matter of years, and how they work, there just isn't the time in this video.
1010400	1015680	The YouTube algorithm has just decided that 15 to 20 minutes is our sweet spot for video length,
1015680	1020880	and if we stray from that, the videos don't perform well. Conveniently, though,
1020880	1026640	Nebula doesn't have an algorithm. So, I created a companion video to this about that topic,
1026640	1032000	and put it there. Nebula subscribers can watch that, our regular videos early and ad-free,
1032000	1036400	other exclusive companion videos and extended cuts, and our big-budget Nebula originals,
1036400	1041040	of which we have plenty, and we have our biggest one yet in post-production right now.
1041040	1045360	Making that even better, you can get access to Nebula through the bundle deal with Curiosity
1045360	1051520	Stream, which is on sale for Father's Day at its lowest ever pricing of under $1 per month.
1051520	1055200	Of course, by signing up through them, you also get access to their massive,
1055200	1059520	super-interesting library of non-fiction documentaries and shows. For example,
1059520	1064080	and I've recommended this before because it's so good, you could watch China's Last Little Train,
1064080	1068800	about the narrow gauge railway that connects one of China's most isolated regions. Altogether,
1068800	1073200	this bundle provides a massive amount of stuff that you'll actually watch, and it comes at an
1073200	1079600	absurdly low price. Again, the current Father's Day sale is the lowest their prices have ever been—just
