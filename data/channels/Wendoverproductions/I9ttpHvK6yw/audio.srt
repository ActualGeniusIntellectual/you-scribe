3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,920
In the final days of December, 2013, in the small village of Meliandou, Guinea, a young,

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,760
18-month-old boy named Emile died.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,320
Only four days before, this child had been completely healthy, acting normally, playing

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,960
regularly in the bat-infested backyard of his rural home.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,840
But then he developed flu-like symptoms which spiraled and spiraled until he passed.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,720
Unfortunately, such an occurrence is not uncommon for the young children of Guinea—a country

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,280
not known for the quality of its healthcare—but then, just a few days later, his sister died

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,280
too.

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,260
Then his mother, then his grandmother, then a family friend—each of which had attended

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,000
to the boy in his final days.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,320
This was not normal.

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,760
But nobody was exactly sure what had happened to these people.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,880
Their symptoms resembled that of a number of illnesses common to the area such as malaria

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,960
and typhoid fever, but in the end, the doctor settled on cholera given this infection's

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,680
profile and propensity in Guinea, but then, the cholera spread.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,940
Now, cholera is contagious so the idea of it spreading is not surprising, but a far

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,640
higher proportion of patients than predicted died.

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,800
Medical staff were starting to get concerned that this might not be just another of the

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,200
area's all-too-common cholera outbreaks and so they passed word on to Médecins Sans

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,640
Frontières, anglicized as Doctors Without Borders, who were, by chance, already on the

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,520
ground in Guinea treating a malaria outbreak.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,920
The organization liaised with the infectious disease experts at their head office in Geneva,

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,080
who presented an unsettling hypothesis.

26
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,880
They weren't sure, but they agreed that it might not be cholera and that it might

27
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,640
be Ebola.

28
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:57,080
The outbreak quite closely followed the profile of this virus but, Ebola had never really

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,800
been an issue in West Africa.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,520
For the most part, it had only ever been seen in Central Africa—what is now North and

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,620
South Sudan, Uganda, the DRC, the Congo, and Gabon.

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,960
These current cases were well over a thousand miles from the closest previous outbreak,

33
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,800
so the idea of the virus simply randomly popping up in the middle of the Ghanaian forest was

34
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
unlikely but nonetheless terrifying, so they needed to be sure.

35
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,720
Therefore, Médecins Sans Frontières gathered samples, packed them in three layers of protective

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,960
packaging, loaded them on a plane chartered from Guécadou, flew them to the capital,

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,800
then transferred them onto the overnight Air France flight to Paris where they were analyzed

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,840
in a specialized lab.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,640
Unfortunately, the worst of their worst fears were confirmed.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,320
Not only was this Ebola, but it was the Zaire strain—the most deadly of Ebola species.

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,320
That confirmation was publicly announced by the World Health Organization on March 23rd,

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,280
2014—nearly three months after the young boy for Meliandou died.

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,140
While the WHO was concerned, the rest of the world was not.

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,360
The rest of the world didn't even realize what was going on or its devastating potential.

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,320
The New York Times, for example, took four whole days after the announcement to publish

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,880
their first article about the virus—an 146-word write-up mostly focusing on the government's

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,000
ban on bat soup in order to curb the spread.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,600
This would be the first of thousands of articles they would write over the next few years about

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,820
this virus.

50
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,680
This was the start of the worst Ebola epidemic in history.

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,740
Now that the virus was identified, the goal shifted to stopping it.

52
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,320
The organization most in charge of coordinating the international response to epidemics is

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,260
the World Health Organization.

54
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,340
The members of this United Nations agency include a majority of the world's countries

55
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,560
and so, when there's a public health emergency, it falls on them to respond.

56
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,460
Once word reached the WHO, their first step was to activate their Global Outbreak Alert

57
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,960
and Response Network.

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,540
This includes, essentially, fast response medical teams for epidemics, the first of

59
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,360
which, in this case, arrived on March 28th—just five days after the initial alert.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,500
Their first goal was to find the links between the patients—to draw a map of who infected

61
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,620
who in order to try and just quarantine everyone exposed and stop the virus before it could

62
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,580
even gain its legs.

63
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,380
This was not particularly difficult in this case as the cases in Meliandou attracted attention

64
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,280
early on, but the news was also not particularly good.

65
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,220
You see, when the first victim, the young Emil, was sick, his mom and sister took him

66
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,580
to stay across the village at his grandmother's house.

67
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,060
When that grandmother later became sick, she went to visit a friend—a nurse in the nearby

68
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,680
larger town of Gwekadu—in order to get some help.

69
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,720
Weeks later, that nurse too developed symptoms and sought help from a friend of his—a doctor

70
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,060
in the even larger town of Masenta.

71
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,460
When that doctor too fell ill, he set off to seek help in the country's capital, but

72
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,340
died along the way and so his body was then sent to the even larger city of Kisudugu

73
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,100
where the funeral was held.

74
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,640
Now, while Ebola does not spread through the air, it does through contact with the bodily

75
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,760
fluids of an infected patient, whether dead or alive, so hospitals and burial facilities

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,060
are where most transmissions occur—especially if proper quarantine procedures are not followed.

77
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,900
Considering that, at this point, nobody knew it was Ebola, nobody was following these procedures

78
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,620
in Meliandu, Gwekadu, Masenta, or Kisudugu, so with each infected patient that went to

79
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,280
these cities, more and more people were infected, with themselves infected more, and so on and

80
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
so forth.

81
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,980
By the time medical institutions knew this was Ebola, three months after the first case,

82
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:47,260
it was too late to trace all the transmissions—the spread was beyond control.

83
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,240
Therefore, focus shifted to isolating and treating the infected.

84
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,600
The WHO, MSF, and other international organizations shipped in staff by the plane load.

85
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,480
Not much longer than a week after detection, there were more than a hundred foreign medical

86
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,980
staff in the country.

87
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,960
The other important goal was to ship in as much protective gear as possible.

88
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,120
Doctors, nurses, and other medical staff are at the most risk for transmission from Ebola

89
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,640
patients and therefore, in order to not become patients themselves, they needed to wear,

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,400
as they became known, Ebola suits, of which thousands were shipped in within weeks.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,120
The country's Ministry of Health quickly set up a system where, if anyone suspected

92
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,280
anyone of having Ebola, they could call a hotline, 115, for a doctor to come out on

93
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
a motorcycle and investigate.

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,000
If this doctor believed the patient could indeed have the virus, they would call out

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,240
a team from MSF which, in full biohazard suits, would transport the patient to an isolation

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,160
ward at a hospital in Conakry, the capital.

97
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,160
The system was quickly overwhelmed with up to 300 calls a day, but it seemed to actually

98
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
work.

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,760
By the beginning of May, less than two months after the initial alert, this hospital in

100
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,560
Conakry where the patients were isolated, reached its first week without a new Ebola

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
patient.

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,140
Then, it reached its second… and its third.

103
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,460
As three weeks is the incubation period for Ebola, the period it takes for symptoms to

104
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:13,000
arise in virus carriers, it meant that, as long as nobody in the hospital was infected,

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,320
the spread would be over.

106
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,400
With that, preparations began for the retreat of the NGOs in Guinea.

107
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,100
It was crisis averted, job well done, mission accomplished.

108
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,360
Until May 27th.

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,960
That's when a new patient came in, and then more came—dozens more from all around the

110
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
country.

111
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,960
It turned out that the Ebola had not, in fact, been stopped, but rather, many of the patients

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,060
in the rural isolated regions of the country had simply become distrustful of medical professionals.

113
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,660
Many had seen foreign medical staff in their towns before they had seen Ebola victims and

114
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,660
therefore, many came to the conclusion that it was these staff who were spreading the

115
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,900
virus rather than preventing its spread.

116
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,660
Therefore, when people in these villages became sick, they simply didn't report it to the

117
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,980
country's medical system which made the problem worse as unprotected, untrained townspeople

118
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,780
cared for the infected.

119
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:12,100
While the May of 2014 saw just 74 official cases, fewer than each of the previous two

120
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,700
months, June saw 290.

121
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,260
By June, with the resurgence in cases, the world was now paying attention to Guinea.

122
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,780
Close by, the borders between Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were quickly closed down

123
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,340
but it was too little, too late.

124
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,140
The virus had spread.

125
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,820
That June also marked the first month that both Liberia and Sierra Leone recorded significant

126
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,420
numbers of cases.

127
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:40,340
Further afield, the rest of the world wanted to be sure that the virus would be contained

128
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,620
to just these three countries.

129
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:48,220
Given that infected individuals can carry the virus with no symptoms for up to 21 days,

130
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,380
travel was a major concern.

131
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Most airlines suspended their flights—Emirate stopped flying to Guinea, Delta stopped flying

132
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,260
to Liberia, and the situation was most pronounced in Sierra Leone where all airlines except

133
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,760
for Brussels Airlines stopped flying to the country's airports.

134
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,720
This lack of flights to the region made things difficult in terms of getting supplies and

135
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,680
workers into the region.

136
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,040
In fact, Brussels Airlines is largely credited with playing a crucial role in the fight against

137
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,040
the epidemic for having not cancelled their flights.

138
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
The airline received praise from everyone up to the Obama administration.

139
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,360
They flew to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone for the entirety of the crisis—carefully

140
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,760
crafting schedules so that their staff would never have to spend an overnight in the Ebola-stricken

141
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,520
nations.

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Passengers departing on these flights were all carefully screened to be sure they were

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,580
not exhibiting symptoms as Belgium and the rest of the world certainly did not want the

144
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,840
virus spreading to their countries and, for the most part, this worked.

145
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,020
While a few isolated cases did appear in various countries worldwide, mostly from health workers

146
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:55,880
returning home, the epidemic was mostly contained to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

147
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,200
Since the virus' containment was successful, the next step was eradication.

148
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,920
Once an individual contracts Ebola, there was not a whole lot that could be done medically

149
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,880
to stop the virus.

150
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,520
Treatment essentially involves assuring that an individual has the fluids and oxygen necessary

151
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,640
for their body to stage the fight.

152
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,200
Therefore, the steps necessary to reach complete eradication of Ebola in West Africa were simple,

153
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,080
but the implementation was tough.

154
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,520
Since Ebola is not contagious until symptoms arise, the key was to just isolate the infected

155
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,120
as soon as symptoms arose.

156
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,260
The issue, though, was that all three of these countries did not have the infrastructure

157
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,020
necessary to treat the thousands of cases that came in each month.

158
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:45,480
Not only that, but in many cases, non-Abola medical facilities actually closed down in

159
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,300
fear of the virus spreading to their staff meaning that, for unrelated health issues,

160
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,500
people were not getting the treatment they needed.

161
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,420
All of the international organizations working in the region scrambled to set up enough Ebola

162
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,020
treatment centers.

163
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,820
These didn't need to be fancy.

164
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:05,660
At the minimum, they could just be tense, but they were crucial to make sure that the

165
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,920
infected patients were not being turned away from treatment and sent back to their communities.

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,180
These organizations confronting the virus each had their own solution on how to stop

167
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,640
the epidemic and this, of course, led to disputes.

168
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,940
For example, the WHO held the position that the best way to rehydrate Ebola patients,

169
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,940
a crucial step given their diarrhea and vomiting, was to administer fluids by IV.

170
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,760
This, theoretically, is true.

171
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,900
It is more effective to rehydrate a patient by IV, but MSF, meanwhile, took a more pragmatic

172
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,460
view saying that, in the conditions, the most effective route was to have patients drink

173
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,500
rehydration solution.

174
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,260
You see, medical staff, confined to thick protective clothing, could only work for about

175
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,060
an hour at a time in the West African heat.

176
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:59,180
Therefore, there was almost always a shortage of medically qualified staff and, according

177
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,780
to the MSF's stance, there just weren't enough resources to set up and monitor all

178
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:09,300
the patient's IVs so, in the end, they were actually getting less fluids overall.

179
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,700
All the different organizations working in the region took their own stance on this debate

180
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,920
as nobody could reach a conclusion on theory versus pragmatism and, given the variety of

181
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:24,300
external variables, retrospective studies today cannot even confidently conclude who

182
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,340
was right.

183
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:31,300
By October, 2014, bed capacity exceeded demand and so, for the most part, there was no longer

184
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,940
an issue of turning patients away.

185
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,100
The other main concern, in terms of containing the virus, was the proper handling of the

186
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,700
deceased as, even after death, the virus can spread.

187
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,060
Cremation would have been by far the safest option but, in the cultures of most of the

188
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,800
affected places, this method of handling the dead is quite taboo.

189
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:56,120
America briefly required the cremation of victims much to the disdain of its citizens

190
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,160
but elsewhere, specialized teams assured the safe burial of the infected—a practice going

191
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,600
against the culture of extensive ceremonial burials in the region.

192
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,680
But at this point, in October, 2014, nobody really knew whether they were at the beginning,

193
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,220
middle, or end of the epidemic.

194
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,760
Nobody could be really sure how effective the efforts had been.

195
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,320
An estimate made by the American CDC at this point estimated the worst case scenario as

196
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,320
1.4 million infected by January, 2015.

197
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:35,040
October, 2014, with 6,987 cases of Ebola, was by far the worst month of the epidemic.

198
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,960
Mercifully though, the worst case scenario did not come true.

199
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,660
Month by month, cases dropped as patient isolation, community engagement, and safe burial proved

200
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,040
effective.

201
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,700
On May 9, 2015, barely a year after the epidemic started its exponential growth, the World

202
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,000
Health Organization published its momentous message—the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is

203
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
over.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,160
More than a month had passed since the last confirmed case meaning further transmission

205
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,000
was improbable.

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,040
That same message came soon after for Guinea and Sierra Leone and, by the new year, 2016,

207
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,280
Ebola was, aside from a few small future flare-ups, eradicated in West Africa.

208
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:26,840
Quite soon after, the statistics came in—28,652 infected and 11,325 dead in what was the worst

209
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,640
Ebola outbreak in history.

210
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,600
Unfortunately though, history is now repeating itself.

211
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,840
On July 17, 2019, the Director General of the World Health Organization announced that

212
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,640
he had declared the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a

213
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,320
public health emergency of international concern—the same, highest level of WHO emergency declared

214
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,320
for the West African epidemic five years ago.

215
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,200
About two years ago, I ran the first away sponsorship on this channel.

216
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,220
I already liked their suitcase when I first got it, but since then, I've travelled with

217
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,460
mine to five continents, a total of well over 100,000 miles, and I can now confidently

218
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,260
say that I love it.

219
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,860
All of their suitcases include tons of features like a TSA approved lock, removable laundry

220
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,460
bag, built-in compression system, super smooth 300 degree spinner wheels, and their carry-on

221
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,100
bags even include an ejectable battery to charge your devices.

222
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,500
Even as I write this video, I'm currently travelling around Europe with their checked

223
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,960
bag—the newest one of mine—while that carry-on away bag I have is back at home,

224
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,360
still in great shape after hundreds of thousands of miles of travel.

225
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,680
If you need a suitcase, away bags are just an incredible value for the quality they are

226
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:44,360
and, since they have lifetime warranties, they will be the last suitcases you ever buy.

227
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,780
The decision is made easier for you by two facts—that they have an 100-day unconditional

228
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,800
trial period and that, by going to awaytravel.com slash wendover20 and using the code wendover20,

229
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,920
you will get $20 off your first order.
