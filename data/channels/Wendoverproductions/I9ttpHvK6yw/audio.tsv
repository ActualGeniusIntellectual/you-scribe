8160	14920	In the final days of December, 2013, in the small village of Meliandou, Guinea, a young,
14920	18760	18-month-old boy named Emile died.
18760	23320	Only four days before, this child had been completely healthy, acting normally, playing
23320	27960	regularly in the bat-infested backyard of his rural home.
28200	33840	But then he developed flu-like symptoms which spiraled and spiraled until he passed.
33840	38720	Unfortunately, such an occurrence is not uncommon for the young children of Guinea—a country
38720	44280	not known for the quality of its healthcare—but then, just a few days later, his sister died
44280	45280	too.
45280	51260	Then his mother, then his grandmother, then a family friend—each of which had attended
51260	54000	to the boy in his final days.
54000	56320	This was not normal.
56320	59760	But nobody was exactly sure what had happened to these people.
59760	63880	Their symptoms resembled that of a number of illnesses common to the area such as malaria
63880	68960	and typhoid fever, but in the end, the doctor settled on cholera given this infection's
68960	73680	profile and propensity in Guinea, but then, the cholera spread.
73680	78940	Now, cholera is contagious so the idea of it spreading is not surprising, but a far
78940	82640	higher proportion of patients than predicted died.
82640	86800	Medical staff were starting to get concerned that this might not be just another of the
86800	91200	area's all-too-common cholera outbreaks and so they passed word on to Médecins Sans
91200	95640	Frontières, anglicized as Doctors Without Borders, who were, by chance, already on the
95640	98520	ground in Guinea treating a malaria outbreak.
98520	102920	The organization liaised with the infectious disease experts at their head office in Geneva,
102920	105080	who presented an unsettling hypothesis.
105080	109880	They weren't sure, but they agreed that it might not be cholera and that it might
109880	111640	be Ebola.
111640	117080	The outbreak quite closely followed the profile of this virus but, Ebola had never really
117080	118800	been an issue in West Africa.
118800	123520	For the most part, it had only ever been seen in Central Africa—what is now North and
123520	127620	South Sudan, Uganda, the DRC, the Congo, and Gabon.
127620	131960	These current cases were well over a thousand miles from the closest previous outbreak,
131960	136800	so the idea of the virus simply randomly popping up in the middle of the Ghanaian forest was
136800	141520	unlikely but nonetheless terrifying, so they needed to be sure.
141520	146720	Therefore, Médecins Sans Frontières gathered samples, packed them in three layers of protective
146720	150960	packaging, loaded them on a plane chartered from Guécadou, flew them to the capital,
150960	154800	then transferred them onto the overnight Air France flight to Paris where they were analyzed
154800	156840	in a specialized lab.
156840	161640	Unfortunately, the worst of their worst fears were confirmed.
161640	168320	Not only was this Ebola, but it was the Zaire strain—the most deadly of Ebola species.
168320	173320	That confirmation was publicly announced by the World Health Organization on March 23rd,
173320	178280	2014—nearly three months after the young boy for Meliandou died.
178280	183140	While the WHO was concerned, the rest of the world was not.
183140	188360	The rest of the world didn't even realize what was going on or its devastating potential.
188360	192320	The New York Times, for example, took four whole days after the announcement to publish
192320	197880	their first article about the virus—an 146-word write-up mostly focusing on the government's
197880	201000	ban on bat soup in order to curb the spread.
201000	205600	This would be the first of thousands of articles they would write over the next few years about
205600	206820	this virus.
206820	211680	This was the start of the worst Ebola epidemic in history.
211680	215740	Now that the virus was identified, the goal shifted to stopping it.
215740	220320	The organization most in charge of coordinating the international response to epidemics is
220320	222260	the World Health Organization.
222260	226340	The members of this United Nations agency include a majority of the world's countries
226340	231560	and so, when there's a public health emergency, it falls on them to respond.
231560	236460	Once word reached the WHO, their first step was to activate their Global Outbreak Alert
236460	237960	and Response Network.
237960	242540	This includes, essentially, fast response medical teams for epidemics, the first of
242540	248360	which, in this case, arrived on March 28th—just five days after the initial alert.
248360	252500	Their first goal was to find the links between the patients—to draw a map of who infected
252500	257620	who in order to try and just quarantine everyone exposed and stop the virus before it could
257620	259580	even gain its legs.
259580	264380	This was not particularly difficult in this case as the cases in Meliandou attracted attention
264380	269280	early on, but the news was also not particularly good.
269280	274220	You see, when the first victim, the young Emil, was sick, his mom and sister took him
274220	277580	to stay across the village at his grandmother's house.
277580	282060	When that grandmother later became sick, she went to visit a friend—a nurse in the nearby
282060	285680	larger town of Gwekadu—in order to get some help.
285680	291720	Weeks later, that nurse too developed symptoms and sought help from a friend of his—a doctor
291720	294060	in the even larger town of Masenta.
294060	298460	When that doctor too fell ill, he set off to seek help in the country's capital, but
298460	303340	died along the way and so his body was then sent to the even larger city of Kisudugu
303340	305100	where the funeral was held.
305100	309640	Now, while Ebola does not spread through the air, it does through contact with the bodily
309640	314760	fluids of an infected patient, whether dead or alive, so hospitals and burial facilities
314760	320060	are where most transmissions occur—especially if proper quarantine procedures are not followed.
320060	324900	Considering that, at this point, nobody knew it was Ebola, nobody was following these procedures
324900	330620	in Meliandu, Gwekadu, Masenta, or Kisudugu, so with each infected patient that went to
330620	336280	these cities, more and more people were infected, with themselves infected more, and so on and
336280	337280	so forth.
337280	341980	By the time medical institutions knew this was Ebola, three months after the first case,
341980	347260	it was too late to trace all the transmissions—the spread was beyond control.
347260	351240	Therefore, focus shifted to isolating and treating the infected.
351240	356600	The WHO, MSF, and other international organizations shipped in staff by the plane load.
356600	360480	Not much longer than a week after detection, there were more than a hundred foreign medical
360480	361980	staff in the country.
361980	365960	The other important goal was to ship in as much protective gear as possible.
365960	371120	Doctors, nurses, and other medical staff are at the most risk for transmission from Ebola
371120	375640	patients and therefore, in order to not become patients themselves, they needed to wear,
375640	380400	as they became known, Ebola suits, of which thousands were shipped in within weeks.
380400	384120	The country's Ministry of Health quickly set up a system where, if anyone suspected
384120	389280	anyone of having Ebola, they could call a hotline, 115, for a doctor to come out on
389280	391320	a motorcycle and investigate.
391320	395000	If this doctor believed the patient could indeed have the virus, they would call out
395000	400240	a team from MSF which, in full biohazard suits, would transport the patient to an isolation
400240	403160	ward at a hospital in Conakry, the capital.
403160	408160	The system was quickly overwhelmed with up to 300 calls a day, but it seemed to actually
408160	409160	work.
409600	413760	By the beginning of May, less than two months after the initial alert, this hospital in
413760	418560	Conakry where the patients were isolated, reached its first week without a new Ebola
418560	419560	patient.
419560	423140	Then, it reached its second… and its third.
423140	427460	As three weeks is the incubation period for Ebola, the period it takes for symptoms to
427460	433000	arise in virus carriers, it meant that, as long as nobody in the hospital was infected,
433000	435320	the spread would be over.
435320	439400	With that, preparations began for the retreat of the NGOs in Guinea.
439400	444100	It was crisis averted, job well done, mission accomplished.
444100	445360	Until May 27th.
445360	450960	That's when a new patient came in, and then more came—dozens more from all around the
450960	451960	country.
451960	456960	It turned out that the Ebola had not, in fact, been stopped, but rather, many of the patients
456960	463060	in the rural isolated regions of the country had simply become distrustful of medical professionals.
463060	467660	Many had seen foreign medical staff in their towns before they had seen Ebola victims and
467660	471660	therefore, many came to the conclusion that it was these staff who were spreading the
471660	474900	virus rather than preventing its spread.
474900	479660	Therefore, when people in these villages became sick, they simply didn't report it to the
479660	484980	country's medical system which made the problem worse as unprotected, untrained townspeople
484980	486780	cared for the infected.
486780	492100	While the May of 2014 saw just 74 official cases, fewer than each of the previous two
492140	495700	months, June saw 290.
495700	501260	By June, with the resurgence in cases, the world was now paying attention to Guinea.
501260	505780	Close by, the borders between Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were quickly closed down
505780	508340	but it was too little, too late.
508340	510140	The virus had spread.
510140	514820	That June also marked the first month that both Liberia and Sierra Leone recorded significant
514820	516420	numbers of cases.
516420	520340	Further afield, the rest of the world wanted to be sure that the virus would be contained
520340	522620	to just these three countries.
522620	528220	Given that infected individuals can carry the virus with no symptoms for up to 21 days,
528220	530380	travel was a major concern.
530380	534380	Most airlines suspended their flights—Emirate stopped flying to Guinea, Delta stopped flying
534380	539260	to Liberia, and the situation was most pronounced in Sierra Leone where all airlines except
539260	542760	for Brussels Airlines stopped flying to the country's airports.
542760	546720	This lack of flights to the region made things difficult in terms of getting supplies and
546720	548680	workers into the region.
548680	554040	In fact, Brussels Airlines is largely credited with playing a crucial role in the fight against
554040	557040	the epidemic for having not cancelled their flights.
557040	560320	The airline received praise from everyone up to the Obama administration.
560320	566360	They flew to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone for the entirety of the crisis—carefully
566360	570760	crafting schedules so that their staff would never have to spend an overnight in the Ebola-stricken
570760	572520	nations.
572520	576000	Passengers departing on these flights were all carefully screened to be sure they were
576000	580580	not exhibiting symptoms as Belgium and the rest of the world certainly did not want the
580580	584840	virus spreading to their countries and, for the most part, this worked.
584840	590020	While a few isolated cases did appear in various countries worldwide, mostly from health workers
590020	595880	returning home, the epidemic was mostly contained to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.
595880	601200	Since the virus' containment was successful, the next step was eradication.
601200	605920	Once an individual contracts Ebola, there was not a whole lot that could be done medically
605920	607880	to stop the virus.
607880	612520	Treatment essentially involves assuring that an individual has the fluids and oxygen necessary
612520	614640	for their body to stage the fight.
614640	620200	Therefore, the steps necessary to reach complete eradication of Ebola in West Africa were simple,
620200	623080	but the implementation was tough.
623080	628520	Since Ebola is not contagious until symptoms arise, the key was to just isolate the infected
628520	631120	as soon as symptoms arose.
631120	635260	The issue, though, was that all three of these countries did not have the infrastructure
635260	640020	necessary to treat the thousands of cases that came in each month.
640020	645480	Not only that, but in many cases, non-Abola medical facilities actually closed down in
645480	650300	fear of the virus spreading to their staff meaning that, for unrelated health issues,
650300	653500	people were not getting the treatment they needed.
653500	658420	All of the international organizations working in the region scrambled to set up enough Ebola
658420	660020	treatment centers.
660020	661820	These didn't need to be fancy.
661820	665660	At the minimum, they could just be tense, but they were crucial to make sure that the
665660	670920	infected patients were not being turned away from treatment and sent back to their communities.
670920	675180	These organizations confronting the virus each had their own solution on how to stop
675180	679640	the epidemic and this, of course, led to disputes.
679640	684940	For example, the WHO held the position that the best way to rehydrate Ebola patients,
684940	689940	a crucial step given their diarrhea and vomiting, was to administer fluids by IV.
690340	692760	This, theoretically, is true.
692760	698900	It is more effective to rehydrate a patient by IV, but MSF, meanwhile, took a more pragmatic
698900	704460	view saying that, in the conditions, the most effective route was to have patients drink
704460	706500	rehydration solution.
706500	711260	You see, medical staff, confined to thick protective clothing, could only work for about
711260	714060	an hour at a time in the West African heat.
714060	719180	Therefore, there was almost always a shortage of medically qualified staff and, according
719220	723780	to the MSF's stance, there just weren't enough resources to set up and monitor all
723780	729300	the patient's IVs so, in the end, they were actually getting less fluids overall.
729300	733700	All the different organizations working in the region took their own stance on this debate
733700	738920	as nobody could reach a conclusion on theory versus pragmatism and, given the variety of
738920	744300	external variables, retrospective studies today cannot even confidently conclude who
744300	745340	was right.
745340	751300	By October, 2014, bed capacity exceeded demand and so, for the most part, there was no longer
751300	753940	an issue of turning patients away.
753940	758100	The other main concern, in terms of containing the virus, was the proper handling of the
758100	762700	deceased as, even after death, the virus can spread.
762700	767060	Cremation would have been by far the safest option but, in the cultures of most of the
767060	771800	affected places, this method of handling the dead is quite taboo.
771800	776120	America briefly required the cremation of victims much to the disdain of its citizens
776120	781160	but elsewhere, specialized teams assured the safe burial of the infected—a practice going
781160	785600	against the culture of extensive ceremonial burials in the region.
785600	790680	But at this point, in October, 2014, nobody really knew whether they were at the beginning,
790680	793220	middle, or end of the epidemic.
793220	796760	Nobody could be really sure how effective the efforts had been.
796760	802320	An estimate made by the American CDC at this point estimated the worst case scenario as
802320	806320	1.4 million infected by January, 2015.
806320	815040	October, 2014, with 6,987 cases of Ebola, was by far the worst month of the epidemic.
815040	818960	Mercifully though, the worst case scenario did not come true.
818960	824660	Month by month, cases dropped as patient isolation, community engagement, and safe burial proved
824660	826040	effective.
826040	831700	On May 9, 2015, barely a year after the epidemic started its exponential growth, the World
831700	838000	Health Organization published its momentous message—the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is
838000	839000	over.
839000	843160	More than a month had passed since the last confirmed case meaning further transmission
843160	845000	was improbable.
845000	851040	That same message came soon after for Guinea and Sierra Leone and, by the new year, 2016,
851040	856280	Ebola was, aside from a few small future flare-ups, eradicated in West Africa.
856280	866840	Quite soon after, the statistics came in—28,652 infected and 11,325 dead in what was the worst
866840	869640	Ebola outbreak in history.
869640	873600	Unfortunately though, history is now repeating itself.
873600	878840	On July 17, 2019, the Director General of the World Health Organization announced that
878840	883640	he had declared the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a
883640	890320	public health emergency of international concern—the same, highest level of WHO emergency declared
890320	895320	for the West African epidemic five years ago.
895320	899200	About two years ago, I ran the first away sponsorship on this channel.
899200	903220	I already liked their suitcase when I first got it, but since then, I've travelled with
903220	908460	mine to five continents, a total of well over 100,000 miles, and I can now confidently
908460	910260	say that I love it.
910260	914860	All of their suitcases include tons of features like a TSA approved lock, removable laundry
914860	919460	bag, built-in compression system, super smooth 300 degree spinner wheels, and their carry-on
919460	923100	bags even include an ejectable battery to charge your devices.
923100	926500	Even as I write this video, I'm currently travelling around Europe with their checked
926500	930960	bag—the newest one of mine—while that carry-on away bag I have is back at home,
930960	934360	still in great shape after hundreds of thousands of miles of travel.
934360	938680	If you need a suitcase, away bags are just an incredible value for the quality they are
938680	944360	and, since they have lifetime warranties, they will be the last suitcases you ever buy.
944360	948780	The decision is made easier for you by two facts—that they have an 100-day unconditional
948780	954800	trial period and that, by going to awaytravel.com slash wendover20 and using the code wendover20,
954800	956920	you will get $20 off your first order.
