00:08.160 --> 00:14.920
In the final days of December, 2013, in the small village of Meliandou, Guinea, a young,

00:14.920 --> 00:18.760
18-month-old boy named Emile died.

00:18.760 --> 00:23.320
Only four days before, this child had been completely healthy, acting normally, playing

00:23.320 --> 00:27.960
regularly in the bat-infested backyard of his rural home.

00:28.200 --> 00:33.840
But then he developed flu-like symptoms which spiraled and spiraled until he passed.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.720
Unfortunately, such an occurrence is not uncommon for the young children of Guinea—a country

00:38.720 --> 00:44.280
not known for the quality of its healthcare—but then, just a few days later, his sister died

00:44.280 --> 00:45.280
too.

00:45.280 --> 00:51.260
Then his mother, then his grandmother, then a family friend—each of which had attended

00:51.260 --> 00:54.000
to the boy in his final days.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.320
This was not normal.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.760
But nobody was exactly sure what had happened to these people.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.880
Their symptoms resembled that of a number of illnesses common to the area such as malaria

01:03.880 --> 01:08.960
and typhoid fever, but in the end, the doctor settled on cholera given this infection's

01:08.960 --> 01:13.680
profile and propensity in Guinea, but then, the cholera spread.

01:13.680 --> 01:18.940
Now, cholera is contagious so the idea of it spreading is not surprising, but a far

01:18.940 --> 01:22.640
higher proportion of patients than predicted died.

01:22.640 --> 01:26.800
Medical staff were starting to get concerned that this might not be just another of the

01:26.800 --> 01:31.200
area's all-too-common cholera outbreaks and so they passed word on to Médecins Sans

01:31.200 --> 01:35.640
Frontières, anglicized as Doctors Without Borders, who were, by chance, already on the

01:35.640 --> 01:38.520
ground in Guinea treating a malaria outbreak.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.920
The organization liaised with the infectious disease experts at their head office in Geneva,

01:42.920 --> 01:45.080
who presented an unsettling hypothesis.

01:45.080 --> 01:49.880
They weren't sure, but they agreed that it might not be cholera and that it might

01:49.880 --> 01:51.640
be Ebola.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.080
The outbreak quite closely followed the profile of this virus but, Ebola had never really

01:57.080 --> 01:58.800
been an issue in West Africa.

01:58.800 --> 02:03.520
For the most part, it had only ever been seen in Central Africa—what is now North and

02:03.520 --> 02:07.620
South Sudan, Uganda, the DRC, the Congo, and Gabon.

02:07.620 --> 02:11.960
These current cases were well over a thousand miles from the closest previous outbreak,

02:11.960 --> 02:16.800
so the idea of the virus simply randomly popping up in the middle of the Ghanaian forest was

02:16.800 --> 02:21.520
unlikely but nonetheless terrifying, so they needed to be sure.

02:21.520 --> 02:26.720
Therefore, Médecins Sans Frontières gathered samples, packed them in three layers of protective

02:26.720 --> 02:30.960
packaging, loaded them on a plane chartered from Guécadou, flew them to the capital,

02:30.960 --> 02:34.800
then transferred them onto the overnight Air France flight to Paris where they were analyzed

02:34.800 --> 02:36.840
in a specialized lab.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.640
Unfortunately, the worst of their worst fears were confirmed.

02:41.640 --> 02:48.320
Not only was this Ebola, but it was the Zaire strain—the most deadly of Ebola species.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.320
That confirmation was publicly announced by the World Health Organization on March 23rd,

02:53.320 --> 02:58.280
2014—nearly three months after the young boy for Meliandou died.

02:58.280 --> 03:03.140
While the WHO was concerned, the rest of the world was not.

03:03.140 --> 03:08.360
The rest of the world didn't even realize what was going on or its devastating potential.

03:08.360 --> 03:12.320
The New York Times, for example, took four whole days after the announcement to publish

03:12.320 --> 03:17.880
their first article about the virus—an 146-word write-up mostly focusing on the government's

03:17.880 --> 03:21.000
ban on bat soup in order to curb the spread.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.600
This would be the first of thousands of articles they would write over the next few years about

03:25.600 --> 03:26.820
this virus.

03:26.820 --> 03:31.680
This was the start of the worst Ebola epidemic in history.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.740
Now that the virus was identified, the goal shifted to stopping it.

03:35.740 --> 03:40.320
The organization most in charge of coordinating the international response to epidemics is

03:40.320 --> 03:42.260
the World Health Organization.

03:42.260 --> 03:46.340
The members of this United Nations agency include a majority of the world's countries

03:46.340 --> 03:51.560
and so, when there's a public health emergency, it falls on them to respond.

03:51.560 --> 03:56.460
Once word reached the WHO, their first step was to activate their Global Outbreak Alert

03:56.460 --> 03:57.960
and Response Network.

03:57.960 --> 04:02.540
This includes, essentially, fast response medical teams for epidemics, the first of

04:02.540 --> 04:08.360
which, in this case, arrived on March 28th—just five days after the initial alert.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.500
Their first goal was to find the links between the patients—to draw a map of who infected

04:12.500 --> 04:17.620
who in order to try and just quarantine everyone exposed and stop the virus before it could

04:17.620 --> 04:19.580
even gain its legs.

04:19.580 --> 04:24.380
This was not particularly difficult in this case as the cases in Meliandou attracted attention

04:24.380 --> 04:29.280
early on, but the news was also not particularly good.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.220
You see, when the first victim, the young Emil, was sick, his mom and sister took him

04:34.220 --> 04:37.580
to stay across the village at his grandmother's house.

04:37.580 --> 04:42.060
When that grandmother later became sick, she went to visit a friend—a nurse in the nearby

04:42.060 --> 04:45.680
larger town of Gwekadu—in order to get some help.

04:45.680 --> 04:51.720
Weeks later, that nurse too developed symptoms and sought help from a friend of his—a doctor

04:51.720 --> 04:54.060
in the even larger town of Masenta.

04:54.060 --> 04:58.460
When that doctor too fell ill, he set off to seek help in the country's capital, but

04:58.460 --> 05:03.340
died along the way and so his body was then sent to the even larger city of Kisudugu

05:03.340 --> 05:05.100
where the funeral was held.

05:05.100 --> 05:09.640
Now, while Ebola does not spread through the air, it does through contact with the bodily

05:09.640 --> 05:14.760
fluids of an infected patient, whether dead or alive, so hospitals and burial facilities

05:14.760 --> 05:20.060
are where most transmissions occur—especially if proper quarantine procedures are not followed.

05:20.060 --> 05:24.900
Considering that, at this point, nobody knew it was Ebola, nobody was following these procedures

05:24.900 --> 05:30.620
in Meliandu, Gwekadu, Masenta, or Kisudugu, so with each infected patient that went to

05:30.620 --> 05:36.280
these cities, more and more people were infected, with themselves infected more, and so on and

05:36.280 --> 05:37.280
so forth.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.980
By the time medical institutions knew this was Ebola, three months after the first case,

05:41.980 --> 05:47.260
it was too late to trace all the transmissions—the spread was beyond control.

05:47.260 --> 05:51.240
Therefore, focus shifted to isolating and treating the infected.

05:51.240 --> 05:56.600
The WHO, MSF, and other international organizations shipped in staff by the plane load.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.480
Not much longer than a week after detection, there were more than a hundred foreign medical

06:00.480 --> 06:01.980
staff in the country.

06:01.980 --> 06:05.960
The other important goal was to ship in as much protective gear as possible.

06:05.960 --> 06:11.120
Doctors, nurses, and other medical staff are at the most risk for transmission from Ebola

06:11.120 --> 06:15.640
patients and therefore, in order to not become patients themselves, they needed to wear,

06:15.640 --> 06:20.400
as they became known, Ebola suits, of which thousands were shipped in within weeks.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.120
The country's Ministry of Health quickly set up a system where, if anyone suspected

06:24.120 --> 06:29.280
anyone of having Ebola, they could call a hotline, 115, for a doctor to come out on

06:29.280 --> 06:31.320
a motorcycle and investigate.

06:31.320 --> 06:35.000
If this doctor believed the patient could indeed have the virus, they would call out

06:35.000 --> 06:40.240
a team from MSF which, in full biohazard suits, would transport the patient to an isolation

06:40.240 --> 06:43.160
ward at a hospital in Conakry, the capital.

06:43.160 --> 06:48.160
The system was quickly overwhelmed with up to 300 calls a day, but it seemed to actually

06:48.160 --> 06:49.160
work.

06:49.600 --> 06:53.760
By the beginning of May, less than two months after the initial alert, this hospital in

06:53.760 --> 06:58.560
Conakry where the patients were isolated, reached its first week without a new Ebola

06:58.560 --> 06:59.560
patient.

06:59.560 --> 07:03.140
Then, it reached its second… and its third.

07:03.140 --> 07:07.460
As three weeks is the incubation period for Ebola, the period it takes for symptoms to

07:07.460 --> 07:13.000
arise in virus carriers, it meant that, as long as nobody in the hospital was infected,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.320
the spread would be over.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.400
With that, preparations began for the retreat of the NGOs in Guinea.

07:19.400 --> 07:24.100
It was crisis averted, job well done, mission accomplished.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.360
Until May 27th.

07:25.360 --> 07:30.960
That's when a new patient came in, and then more came—dozens more from all around the

07:30.960 --> 07:31.960
country.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.960
It turned out that the Ebola had not, in fact, been stopped, but rather, many of the patients

07:36.960 --> 07:43.060
in the rural isolated regions of the country had simply become distrustful of medical professionals.

07:43.060 --> 07:47.660
Many had seen foreign medical staff in their towns before they had seen Ebola victims and

07:47.660 --> 07:51.660
therefore, many came to the conclusion that it was these staff who were spreading the

07:51.660 --> 07:54.900
virus rather than preventing its spread.

07:54.900 --> 07:59.660
Therefore, when people in these villages became sick, they simply didn't report it to the

07:59.660 --> 08:04.980
country's medical system which made the problem worse as unprotected, untrained townspeople

08:04.980 --> 08:06.780
cared for the infected.

08:06.780 --> 08:12.100
While the May of 2014 saw just 74 official cases, fewer than each of the previous two

08:12.140 --> 08:15.700
months, June saw 290.

08:15.700 --> 08:21.260
By June, with the resurgence in cases, the world was now paying attention to Guinea.

08:21.260 --> 08:25.780
Close by, the borders between Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were quickly closed down

08:25.780 --> 08:28.340
but it was too little, too late.

08:28.340 --> 08:30.140
The virus had spread.

08:30.140 --> 08:34.820
That June also marked the first month that both Liberia and Sierra Leone recorded significant

08:34.820 --> 08:36.420
numbers of cases.

08:36.420 --> 08:40.340
Further afield, the rest of the world wanted to be sure that the virus would be contained

08:40.340 --> 08:42.620
to just these three countries.

08:42.620 --> 08:48.220
Given that infected individuals can carry the virus with no symptoms for up to 21 days,

08:48.220 --> 08:50.380
travel was a major concern.

08:50.380 --> 08:54.380
Most airlines suspended their flights—Emirate stopped flying to Guinea, Delta stopped flying

08:54.380 --> 08:59.260
to Liberia, and the situation was most pronounced in Sierra Leone where all airlines except

08:59.260 --> 09:02.760
for Brussels Airlines stopped flying to the country's airports.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.720
This lack of flights to the region made things difficult in terms of getting supplies and

09:06.720 --> 09:08.680
workers into the region.

09:08.680 --> 09:14.040
In fact, Brussels Airlines is largely credited with playing a crucial role in the fight against

09:14.040 --> 09:17.040
the epidemic for having not cancelled their flights.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.320
The airline received praise from everyone up to the Obama administration.

09:20.320 --> 09:26.360
They flew to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone for the entirety of the crisis—carefully

09:26.360 --> 09:30.760
crafting schedules so that their staff would never have to spend an overnight in the Ebola-stricken

09:30.760 --> 09:32.520
nations.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.000
Passengers departing on these flights were all carefully screened to be sure they were

09:36.000 --> 09:40.580
not exhibiting symptoms as Belgium and the rest of the world certainly did not want the

09:40.580 --> 09:44.840
virus spreading to their countries and, for the most part, this worked.

09:44.840 --> 09:50.020
While a few isolated cases did appear in various countries worldwide, mostly from health workers

09:50.020 --> 09:55.880
returning home, the epidemic was mostly contained to Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

09:55.880 --> 10:01.200
Since the virus' containment was successful, the next step was eradication.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.920
Once an individual contracts Ebola, there was not a whole lot that could be done medically

10:05.920 --> 10:07.880
to stop the virus.

10:07.880 --> 10:12.520
Treatment essentially involves assuring that an individual has the fluids and oxygen necessary

10:12.520 --> 10:14.640
for their body to stage the fight.

10:14.640 --> 10:20.200
Therefore, the steps necessary to reach complete eradication of Ebola in West Africa were simple,

10:20.200 --> 10:23.080
but the implementation was tough.

10:23.080 --> 10:28.520
Since Ebola is not contagious until symptoms arise, the key was to just isolate the infected

10:28.520 --> 10:31.120
as soon as symptoms arose.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.260
The issue, though, was that all three of these countries did not have the infrastructure

10:35.260 --> 10:40.020
necessary to treat the thousands of cases that came in each month.

10:40.020 --> 10:45.480
Not only that, but in many cases, non-Abola medical facilities actually closed down in

10:45.480 --> 10:50.300
fear of the virus spreading to their staff meaning that, for unrelated health issues,

10:50.300 --> 10:53.500
people were not getting the treatment they needed.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.420
All of the international organizations working in the region scrambled to set up enough Ebola

10:58.420 --> 11:00.020
treatment centers.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.820
These didn't need to be fancy.

11:01.820 --> 11:05.660
At the minimum, they could just be tense, but they were crucial to make sure that the

11:05.660 --> 11:10.920
infected patients were not being turned away from treatment and sent back to their communities.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.180
These organizations confronting the virus each had their own solution on how to stop

11:15.180 --> 11:19.640
the epidemic and this, of course, led to disputes.

11:19.640 --> 11:24.940
For example, the WHO held the position that the best way to rehydrate Ebola patients,

11:24.940 --> 11:29.940
a crucial step given their diarrhea and vomiting, was to administer fluids by IV.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.760
This, theoretically, is true.

11:32.760 --> 11:38.900
It is more effective to rehydrate a patient by IV, but MSF, meanwhile, took a more pragmatic

11:38.900 --> 11:44.460
view saying that, in the conditions, the most effective route was to have patients drink

11:44.460 --> 11:46.500
rehydration solution.

11:46.500 --> 11:51.260
You see, medical staff, confined to thick protective clothing, could only work for about

11:51.260 --> 11:54.060
an hour at a time in the West African heat.

11:54.060 --> 11:59.180
Therefore, there was almost always a shortage of medically qualified staff and, according

11:59.220 --> 12:03.780
to the MSF's stance, there just weren't enough resources to set up and monitor all

12:03.780 --> 12:09.300
the patient's IVs so, in the end, they were actually getting less fluids overall.

12:09.300 --> 12:13.700
All the different organizations working in the region took their own stance on this debate

12:13.700 --> 12:18.920
as nobody could reach a conclusion on theory versus pragmatism and, given the variety of

12:18.920 --> 12:24.300
external variables, retrospective studies today cannot even confidently conclude who

12:24.300 --> 12:25.340
was right.

12:25.340 --> 12:31.300
By October, 2014, bed capacity exceeded demand and so, for the most part, there was no longer

12:31.300 --> 12:33.940
an issue of turning patients away.

12:33.940 --> 12:38.100
The other main concern, in terms of containing the virus, was the proper handling of the

12:38.100 --> 12:42.700
deceased as, even after death, the virus can spread.

12:42.700 --> 12:47.060
Cremation would have been by far the safest option but, in the cultures of most of the

12:47.060 --> 12:51.800
affected places, this method of handling the dead is quite taboo.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.120
America briefly required the cremation of victims much to the disdain of its citizens

12:56.120 --> 13:01.160
but elsewhere, specialized teams assured the safe burial of the infected—a practice going

13:01.160 --> 13:05.600
against the culture of extensive ceremonial burials in the region.

13:05.600 --> 13:10.680
But at this point, in October, 2014, nobody really knew whether they were at the beginning,

13:10.680 --> 13:13.220
middle, or end of the epidemic.

13:13.220 --> 13:16.760
Nobody could be really sure how effective the efforts had been.

13:16.760 --> 13:22.320
An estimate made by the American CDC at this point estimated the worst case scenario as

13:22.320 --> 13:26.320
1.4 million infected by January, 2015.

13:26.320 --> 13:35.040
October, 2014, with 6,987 cases of Ebola, was by far the worst month of the epidemic.

13:35.040 --> 13:38.960
Mercifully though, the worst case scenario did not come true.

13:38.960 --> 13:44.660
Month by month, cases dropped as patient isolation, community engagement, and safe burial proved

13:44.660 --> 13:46.040
effective.

13:46.040 --> 13:51.700
On May 9, 2015, barely a year after the epidemic started its exponential growth, the World

13:51.700 --> 13:58.000
Health Organization published its momentous message—the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
over.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.160
More than a month had passed since the last confirmed case meaning further transmission

14:03.160 --> 14:05.000
was improbable.

14:05.000 --> 14:11.040
That same message came soon after for Guinea and Sierra Leone and, by the new year, 2016,

14:11.040 --> 14:16.280
Ebola was, aside from a few small future flare-ups, eradicated in West Africa.

14:16.280 --> 14:26.840
Quite soon after, the statistics came in—28,652 infected and 11,325 dead in what was the worst

14:26.840 --> 14:29.640
Ebola outbreak in history.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.600
Unfortunately though, history is now repeating itself.

14:33.600 --> 14:38.840
On July 17, 2019, the Director General of the World Health Organization announced that

14:38.840 --> 14:43.640
he had declared the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo a

14:43.640 --> 14:50.320
public health emergency of international concern—the same, highest level of WHO emergency declared

14:50.320 --> 14:55.320
for the West African epidemic five years ago.

14:55.320 --> 14:59.200
About two years ago, I ran the first away sponsorship on this channel.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.220
I already liked their suitcase when I first got it, but since then, I've travelled with

15:03.220 --> 15:08.460
mine to five continents, a total of well over 100,000 miles, and I can now confidently

15:08.460 --> 15:10.260
say that I love it.

15:10.260 --> 15:14.860
All of their suitcases include tons of features like a TSA approved lock, removable laundry

15:14.860 --> 15:19.460
bag, built-in compression system, super smooth 300 degree spinner wheels, and their carry-on

15:19.460 --> 15:23.100
bags even include an ejectable battery to charge your devices.

15:23.100 --> 15:26.500
Even as I write this video, I'm currently travelling around Europe with their checked

15:26.500 --> 15:30.960
bag—the newest one of mine—while that carry-on away bag I have is back at home,

15:30.960 --> 15:34.360
still in great shape after hundreds of thousands of miles of travel.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.680
If you need a suitcase, away bags are just an incredible value for the quality they are

15:38.680 --> 15:44.360
and, since they have lifetime warranties, they will be the last suitcases you ever buy.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.780
The decision is made easier for you by two facts—that they have an 100-day unconditional

15:48.780 --> 15:54.800
trial period and that, by going to awaytravel.com slash wendover20 and using the code wendover20,

15:54.800 --> 15:56.920
you will get $20 off your first order.
