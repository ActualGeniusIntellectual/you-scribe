00:06.920 --> 00:12.120
It's 4 AM on a mid-August morning in the Northern California wilderness.

00:12.120 --> 00:15.940
During a brief overnight storm, lightning strikes the top of a hill, ignites some dry

00:15.940 --> 00:18.880
underbrush, and starts a wildfire.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.660
It isn't until 6 AM as the sun rises that someone notices the fire—a hiker camping

00:23.660 --> 00:25.040
on an overlooking hill.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.920
As soon as the hiker's 911 call is received by the emergency dispatch center, they contact

00:29.920 --> 00:34.780
CAL FIRE—the agency responsible for wildfire protection and management in California.

00:34.780 --> 00:38.540
By 630, they call the Redding, California-based smokejumpers.

00:38.540 --> 00:42.300
They are one of the most elite firefighting squads in the United States.

00:42.300 --> 00:47.440
There are only 400 smokejumpers in the US and 40 of those are based here in Redding,

00:47.440 --> 00:48.440
California.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.400
They're essentially the rapid response team for wildfires.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.600
Within 15 minutes of receiving the call, these smokejumpers are in their plane and taking

00:55.600 --> 00:56.600
off.

00:56.600 --> 01:01.140
It takes 20 minutes to fly the 50 miles to the fire site where they find a suitable tree-free

01:01.140 --> 01:05.020
landing spot, jump, deploy their parachutes, and land.

01:05.020 --> 01:08.920
The plane then circles back to parachute down boxes of equipment.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.920
Smokejumpers carry with them enough supplies to last 72 hours completely self-supported—food,

01:12.920 --> 01:17.040
water, shelter, safety equipment, and firefighting tools.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.960
They follow the ridgeline and make their way to the fire.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.520
Now, this is a small team and they need to decide how to prioritize what they do.

01:24.520 --> 01:28.380
With the fire already having grown to 15 acres the team knows they're unlikely to

01:28.380 --> 01:32.120
stop it on their own—backups are already on the way—so their priority is to slow

01:32.120 --> 01:34.460
it down as much as possible.

01:34.460 --> 01:39.260
There are four major factors that affect how fast a fire moves—how much fuel there is,

01:39.260 --> 01:42.400
how wet the fuel is, the wind direction, and the slope.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.040
The two factors that the team can immediately gauge that affect where the fire will move

01:46.040 --> 01:48.600
fastest are the wind direction and slope.

01:48.600 --> 01:52.140
In this case the wind is coming from the north and they know that to the southwest is an

01:52.140 --> 01:53.360
upward slope.

01:53.360 --> 01:58.040
Fire moves faster uphill than it does downhill since the fire burns upwards so these smokejumpers

01:58.040 --> 02:01.720
know that this is likely the fire's fastest moving front.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.200
While trees do burn, the primary source of fuel that a wildfire uses to move is the dry

02:06.200 --> 02:10.720
brush and dead wood on the forest floor so the biggest technique used to stop forest

02:10.720 --> 02:13.680
fires is to create what's called a fire line.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.340
These are essentially a gap where they remove all fuel—plants both dead and alive—so

02:18.340 --> 02:20.900
that there's nothing for the fire to continue burning.

02:20.900 --> 02:25.560
The smokejumpers use a mix of chainsaws and other hand tools to do this work but sometimes

02:25.560 --> 02:27.460
fire lines are pre-built.

02:27.460 --> 02:31.260
In this case, there's a road at the top of the uphill section which will help slow

02:31.260 --> 02:34.420
or stop the fire so they can direct their efforts elsewhere.

02:34.420 --> 02:38.820
They use the road as their anchor point—a cleared section that the fire likely won't

02:38.820 --> 02:43.100
cross where they start building their fire lines so the fire can't outflank them.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.060
Throughout this construction process the smokejumpers need to be sure that they can escape in case

02:47.060 --> 02:50.020
the wind shift or the fire picks up speed.

02:50.020 --> 02:54.460
Firefighters can move exceptionally fast—up to 7 miles per hour in forests which is faster

02:54.460 --> 02:57.620
than humans are often able to make their way through dense trees.

02:57.620 --> 03:02.340
In grasslands fires can move up to 14 miles per hour so firefighters have to be extra

03:02.340 --> 03:03.340
cautious.

03:03.340 --> 03:07.580
For this reason firefighters rarely put themselves directly in front of the fires moving front—they'll

03:07.580 --> 03:09.780
either be far ahead or to the side.

03:09.780 --> 03:13.060
In the case of this fire, as they're building this first fire line they're close to a

03:13.060 --> 03:18.380
road which acts as an easy exit point but, just in case, all smokejumpers carry fire

03:18.380 --> 03:19.380
shelters.

03:19.740 --> 03:23.080
These compact, lightweight shelters won't survive direct flames for too long but they

03:23.080 --> 03:27.380
do greatly increase a firefighter's chance of survival in case they can't escape the

03:27.380 --> 03:28.940
path of a fire.

03:28.940 --> 03:33.660
After a little over an hour of work, the smokejumpers complete a continuous fire line from the road

03:33.660 --> 03:34.660
to a stream.

03:34.660 --> 03:39.220
Streams, while less secure than roads, also help stop or slow down a fire by acting as

03:39.220 --> 03:40.220
a fire line.

03:40.220 --> 03:44.000
To the southeast of the fire there's also a small road that connects to another stream

03:44.000 --> 03:48.180
meaning there are at least rudimentary fire lines on three sides of the fire.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.060
It's at this time when backups arrive by road.

03:51.060 --> 03:54.080
The added manpower allows for much faster action.

03:54.080 --> 03:58.020
The immediate focus goes to strengthening the southeastern fire line—currently just

03:58.020 --> 03:59.020
a stream.

03:59.020 --> 04:03.200
At closest, the fire's less than 100 feet from the stream and the stream is itself in

04:03.200 --> 04:07.200
a valley so it's too risky to work directly behind the stream—there's just no good

04:07.200 --> 04:11.940
escape route—so the new arrivals get to work on a redundant fire line 100 feet behind

04:11.940 --> 04:12.940
the stream.

04:12.940 --> 04:17.860
By 10 AM the fire has further grown and the team knows that the worst is still to come.

04:17.860 --> 04:22.820
Fire spreads most rapidly between 10 AM and sunset due to the daytime heat and wind.

04:22.820 --> 04:26.880
By 11 AM the fire has reached the road and part of the fire line which means that some

04:26.880 --> 04:30.640
of those who are building the fire line are reallocated to make sure that the fire line

04:30.640 --> 04:34.020
holds, extinguishing any flames that may jump the road.

04:34.020 --> 04:38.780
By noon the fire lines are holding and, while the fire size is growing, it's at a manageable

04:38.780 --> 04:43.400
pace so there's reasonable hope that it can be suppressed before expanding to an uncontrollable

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
size.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.780
At 1 PM, though, conditions change.

04:46.780 --> 04:50.940
The wind starts blowing harder towards the southwest and, as trees burn on the north

04:50.940 --> 04:55.500
side of the road, the wind pushes embers over the road which ignite underbrush on the other

04:55.500 --> 05:00.000
side and now the entire focus of the firefighting efforts change.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.860
You see, the point of fighting wildfires is not actually to put them out—it's to control

05:04.860 --> 05:05.860
them.

05:05.860 --> 05:09.940
While the number of wildfires has increased due to humans, they're actually a very natural

05:09.940 --> 05:10.940
phenomenon.

05:10.940 --> 05:14.420
What's making wildfires worse is humans stopping them.

05:14.420 --> 05:19.180
Many forests survive wildfire through trees having heat-resistant bark and other evolutionary

05:19.180 --> 05:20.260
adaptations.

05:20.260 --> 05:24.780
These fire-resistant forests relied on having wildfires at a consistent interval every few

05:24.780 --> 05:29.300
decades to clear out the forest floor of dead plants and to kill invasive species.

05:29.300 --> 05:34.380
Nowadays, though, as humans suppress fires a forest might only see a wildfire every 50

05:34.380 --> 05:38.460
years instead of 25, for example, meaning that there's twice as much fuel and so the

05:38.460 --> 05:41.880
fire burns faster, larger, and more intensely.

05:41.880 --> 05:45.820
It was only until recent years that the research revealing this was widely accepted so the

05:45.820 --> 05:50.280
goals of firefighting shifted from stopping wildfires completely to controlling them.

05:50.280 --> 05:55.000
In some places, being a firefighter actually means starting fires.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.640
Fire management agencies will conduct controlled burns in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrollable

05:59.640 --> 06:02.480
fire and to increase the health of a forest.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.240
While forests can survive wildfires, humans cannot so most agencies will let fires burn

06:07.240 --> 06:11.280
in a controlled fashion up until the moment they risk damaging property or threatening

06:11.320 --> 06:12.680
human life.

06:12.680 --> 06:15.960
This fire that jumped the road just did exactly that.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.040
At the bottom of this slope is a town and the fire is now headed in that direction with

06:20.040 --> 06:22.720
no pre-existing features to stop it.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.620
That means that all measures must be taken to aggressively stop the fire's expansion

06:26.620 --> 06:27.800
to the west.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.120
That means it's time to bring out the big guns.

06:30.120 --> 06:33.120
It's time to attack the fire from above.

06:33.120 --> 06:37.680
Planes and helicopters are some of the most effective tools used to fight wildfires.

06:37.680 --> 06:42.040
They can quickly and accurately drop huge amounts of water or fire retardant.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.480
The decision to use aerial firefighting does not come lightly as it's both hugely expensive

06:46.480 --> 06:50.360
and using an aircraft on one fire means it can't be used on another.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.520
Their use needs to be prioritized for the most dangerous fires.

06:53.520 --> 06:58.280
There's also a decision to be made on what the aircraft is going to drop—water or flame

06:58.280 --> 06:59.460
retardant.

06:59.460 --> 07:03.720
Water is cheap and with some aircraft designs can be reloaded near the fire without landing

07:03.720 --> 07:05.080
at an airport.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.220
Water is only effective at extinguishing flames, though.

07:08.220 --> 07:12.040
Flame retardant, on the other hand, can be used to stop flames from starting.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.100
It can essentially create a fire line ahead of the fire spread as it will stop a line

07:16.100 --> 07:17.620
of forest from burning.

07:17.620 --> 07:22.160
The main issues, though, are that flame retardant can only be loaded at an airport and it's

07:22.160 --> 07:23.760
very expensive.

07:23.760 --> 07:28.560
A gallon of Foschek, the most commonly used brand of flame retardant, costs $3.

07:28.560 --> 07:33.060
That's about the same as a gallon of milk at the grocery store but these aircraft use

07:33.060 --> 07:36.100
thousands of gallons of it for each drop.

07:36.100 --> 07:40.900
The world's largest firefighting aircraft, the 747 supertanker, for example, carries

07:40.900 --> 07:46.940
19,600 gallons of flame retardant meaning that what it uses in one drop costs nearly

07:46.940 --> 07:48.740
$60,000.

07:48.740 --> 07:52.580
Of course there's a reason agencies hire this plane—it creates a three mile long

07:52.580 --> 07:56.720
fire line almost instantly, but it comes at a steep price.

07:56.720 --> 08:00.100
For this fire, using such an expensive tool would be overkill.

08:00.140 --> 08:03.220
In this case, they'll use a helicopter with a bucket attached.

08:03.220 --> 08:06.940
The bucket is filled with water from a nearby lake then the helicopter flies over to the

08:06.940 --> 08:08.400
fire and drops it.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.640
With only five miles to the lake, the helicopter is able to make a drop about every five to

08:12.640 --> 08:17.160
ten minutes and, while it works on stopping the spread on one side, hand crews work on

08:17.160 --> 08:19.100
building a fire line on the other.

08:19.100 --> 08:23.580
The area that the helicopter extinguishes essentially acts as its own fire line as fire

08:23.580 --> 08:25.380
can't burn what's already burned.

08:25.380 --> 08:27.340
This work continues for the next few hours.

08:27.580 --> 08:31.540
It's vital not to let anything to the southwest of the road burn out of control.

08:31.540 --> 08:35.900
By 4 pm the outbreak is managed and attention can be directed back to the largest section

08:35.900 --> 08:37.100
of the fire.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.460
As the afternoon wears on some crews get back to lengthening the eastern fire line, others

08:41.460 --> 08:45.860
begin constructing a western fire line, and the helicopter works on slowing the advancement

08:45.860 --> 08:46.860
to the north.

08:46.860 --> 08:51.620
By the time the sun begins to set around 8, all sides of the fire have at least some element

08:51.620 --> 08:56.020
of control so that during the night and in the coming days the fire can continue to burn

08:56.020 --> 08:59.620
in a controlled fashion until there's nothing left to burn.

08:59.620 --> 09:04.500
This mission was a success but the reality is that this is not a real fire.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.020
Real fires rarely end this well.

09:07.020 --> 09:12.100
Real fires don't act so predictably because real fires can't be predicted.

09:12.100 --> 09:17.660
Real fires are a menace that can grow to the size of small countries and can burn for months.

09:17.660 --> 09:22.340
During summer and fall there are often more than 100 large forest fires burning around

09:22.340 --> 09:26.620
the US at any given time and thousands more around the world.

09:26.620 --> 09:30.940
No firefighting effort is exactly like another but these are the primary techniques used

09:30.940 --> 09:35.700
by those who work every day to protect life and property from one of nature's most dangerous

09:35.700 --> 09:37.700
phenomenons.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.060
Whether you're fighting forest fires or running a business, the tools you use are

09:41.060 --> 09:42.460
crucially important.

09:42.460 --> 09:47.220
In both cases, they directly affect how well you do your job and, while chainsaws, axes,

09:47.220 --> 09:50.980
and shovels are some of the most important tools in firefighting, Squarespace is one
