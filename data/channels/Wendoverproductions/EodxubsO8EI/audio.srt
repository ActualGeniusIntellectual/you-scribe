3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,120
It's 4 AM on a mid-August morning in the Northern California wilderness.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,940
During a brief overnight storm, lightning strikes the top of a hill, ignites some dry

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,880
underbrush, and starts a wildfire.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,660
It isn't until 6 AM as the sun rises that someone notices the fire—a hiker camping

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,040
on an overlooking hill.

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,920
As soon as the hiker's 911 call is received by the emergency dispatch center, they contact

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,780
CAL FIRE—the agency responsible for wildfire protection and management in California.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,540
By 630, they call the Redding, California-based smokejumpers.

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,300
They are one of the most elite firefighting squads in the United States.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,440
There are only 400 smokejumpers in the US and 40 of those are based here in Redding,

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
California.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,400
They're essentially the rapid response team for wildfires.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:55,600
Within 15 minutes of receiving the call, these smokejumpers are in their plane and taking

16
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600
off.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,140
It takes 20 minutes to fly the 50 miles to the fire site where they find a suitable tree-free

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,020
landing spot, jump, deploy their parachutes, and land.

19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:08,920
The plane then circles back to parachute down boxes of equipment.

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,920
Smokejumpers carry with them enough supplies to last 72 hours completely self-supported—food,

21
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,040
water, shelter, safety equipment, and firefighting tools.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,960
They follow the ridgeline and make their way to the fire.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,520
Now, this is a small team and they need to decide how to prioritize what they do.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,380
With the fire already having grown to 15 acres the team knows they're unlikely to

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,120
stop it on their own—backups are already on the way—so their priority is to slow

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,460
it down as much as possible.

27
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,260
There are four major factors that affect how fast a fire moves—how much fuel there is,

28
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,400
how wet the fuel is, the wind direction, and the slope.

29
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,040
The two factors that the team can immediately gauge that affect where the fire will move

30
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,600
fastest are the wind direction and slope.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,140
In this case the wind is coming from the north and they know that to the southwest is an

32
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,360
upward slope.

33
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,040
Fire moves faster uphill than it does downhill since the fire burns upwards so these smokejumpers

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,720
know that this is likely the fire's fastest moving front.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,200
While trees do burn, the primary source of fuel that a wildfire uses to move is the dry

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,720
brush and dead wood on the forest floor so the biggest technique used to stop forest

37
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,680
fires is to create what's called a fire line.

38
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,340
These are essentially a gap where they remove all fuel—plants both dead and alive—so

39
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,900
that there's nothing for the fire to continue burning.

40
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,560
The smokejumpers use a mix of chainsaws and other hand tools to do this work but sometimes

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,460
fire lines are pre-built.

42
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,260
In this case, there's a road at the top of the uphill section which will help slow

43
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,420
or stop the fire so they can direct their efforts elsewhere.

44
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,820
They use the road as their anchor point—a cleared section that the fire likely won't

45
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,100
cross where they start building their fire lines so the fire can't outflank them.

46
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,060
Throughout this construction process the smokejumpers need to be sure that they can escape in case

47
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,020
the wind shift or the fire picks up speed.

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,460
Firefighters can move exceptionally fast—up to 7 miles per hour in forests which is faster

49
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,620
than humans are often able to make their way through dense trees.

50
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,340
In grasslands fires can move up to 14 miles per hour so firefighters have to be extra

51
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
cautious.

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,580
For this reason firefighters rarely put themselves directly in front of the fires moving front—they'll

53
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,780
either be far ahead or to the side.

54
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,060
In the case of this fire, as they're building this first fire line they're close to a

55
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,380
road which acts as an easy exit point but, just in case, all smokejumpers carry fire

56
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,380
shelters.

57
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,080
These compact, lightweight shelters won't survive direct flames for too long but they

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,380
do greatly increase a firefighter's chance of survival in case they can't escape the

59
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,940
path of a fire.

60
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,660
After a little over an hour of work, the smokejumpers complete a continuous fire line from the road

61
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
to a stream.

62
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,220
Streams, while less secure than roads, also help stop or slow down a fire by acting as

63
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,220
a fire line.

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,000
To the southeast of the fire there's also a small road that connects to another stream

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,180
meaning there are at least rudimentary fire lines on three sides of the fire.

66
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,060
It's at this time when backups arrive by road.

67
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,080
The added manpower allows for much faster action.

68
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,020
The immediate focus goes to strengthening the southeastern fire line—currently just

69
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
a stream.

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,200
At closest, the fire's less than 100 feet from the stream and the stream is itself in

71
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
a valley so it's too risky to work directly behind the stream—there's just no good

72
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,940
escape route—so the new arrivals get to work on a redundant fire line 100 feet behind

73
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
the stream.

74
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,860
By 10 AM the fire has further grown and the team knows that the worst is still to come.

75
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,820
Fire spreads most rapidly between 10 AM and sunset due to the daytime heat and wind.

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,880
By 11 AM the fire has reached the road and part of the fire line which means that some

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,640
of those who are building the fire line are reallocated to make sure that the fire line

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,020
holds, extinguishing any flames that may jump the road.

79
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,780
By noon the fire lines are holding and, while the fire size is growing, it's at a manageable

80
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:43,400
pace so there's reasonable hope that it can be suppressed before expanding to an uncontrollable

81
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
size.

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,780
At 1 PM, though, conditions change.

83
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,940
The wind starts blowing harder towards the southwest and, as trees burn on the north

84
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,500
side of the road, the wind pushes embers over the road which ignite underbrush on the other

85
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,000
side and now the entire focus of the firefighting efforts change.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,860
You see, the point of fighting wildfires is not actually to put them out—it's to control

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
them.

88
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,940
While the number of wildfires has increased due to humans, they're actually a very natural

89
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
phenomenon.

90
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,420
What's making wildfires worse is humans stopping them.

91
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,180
Many forests survive wildfire through trees having heat-resistant bark and other evolutionary

92
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,260
adaptations.

93
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,780
These fire-resistant forests relied on having wildfires at a consistent interval every few

94
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,300
decades to clear out the forest floor of dead plants and to kill invasive species.

95
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,380
Nowadays, though, as humans suppress fires a forest might only see a wildfire every 50

96
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,460
years instead of 25, for example, meaning that there's twice as much fuel and so the

97
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,880
fire burns faster, larger, and more intensely.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,820
It was only until recent years that the research revealing this was widely accepted so the

99
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,280
goals of firefighting shifted from stopping wildfires completely to controlling them.

100
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,000
In some places, being a firefighter actually means starting fires.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,640
Fire management agencies will conduct controlled burns in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrollable

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,480
fire and to increase the health of a forest.

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,240
While forests can survive wildfires, humans cannot so most agencies will let fires burn

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,280
in a controlled fashion up until the moment they risk damaging property or threatening

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,680
human life.

106
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,960
This fire that jumped the road just did exactly that.

107
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,040
At the bottom of this slope is a town and the fire is now headed in that direction with

108
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,720
no pre-existing features to stop it.

109
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,620
That means that all measures must be taken to aggressively stop the fire's expansion

110
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,800
to the west.

111
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,120
That means it's time to bring out the big guns.

112
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,120
It's time to attack the fire from above.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
Planes and helicopters are some of the most effective tools used to fight wildfires.

114
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,040
They can quickly and accurately drop huge amounts of water or fire retardant.

115
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,480
The decision to use aerial firefighting does not come lightly as it's both hugely expensive

116
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,360
and using an aircraft on one fire means it can't be used on another.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,520
Their use needs to be prioritized for the most dangerous fires.

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,280
There's also a decision to be made on what the aircraft is going to drop—water or flame

119
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,460
retardant.

120
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,720
Water is cheap and with some aircraft designs can be reloaded near the fire without landing

121
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,080
at an airport.

122
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,220
Water is only effective at extinguishing flames, though.

123
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,040
Flame retardant, on the other hand, can be used to stop flames from starting.

124
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,100
It can essentially create a fire line ahead of the fire spread as it will stop a line

125
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,620
of forest from burning.

126
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,160
The main issues, though, are that flame retardant can only be loaded at an airport and it's

127
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,760
very expensive.

128
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,560
A gallon of Foschek, the most commonly used brand of flame retardant, costs $3.

129
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,060
That's about the same as a gallon of milk at the grocery store but these aircraft use

130
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,100
thousands of gallons of it for each drop.

131
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,900
The world's largest firefighting aircraft, the 747 supertanker, for example, carries

132
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,940
19,600 gallons of flame retardant meaning that what it uses in one drop costs nearly

133
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,740
$60,000.

134
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,580
Of course there's a reason agencies hire this plane—it creates a three mile long

135
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,720
fire line almost instantly, but it comes at a steep price.

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,100
For this fire, using such an expensive tool would be overkill.

137
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,220
In this case, they'll use a helicopter with a bucket attached.

138
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,940
The bucket is filled with water from a nearby lake then the helicopter flies over to the

139
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,400
fire and drops it.

140
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,640
With only five miles to the lake, the helicopter is able to make a drop about every five to

141
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,160
ten minutes and, while it works on stopping the spread on one side, hand crews work on

142
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,100
building a fire line on the other.

143
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,580
The area that the helicopter extinguishes essentially acts as its own fire line as fire

144
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,380
can't burn what's already burned.

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,340
This work continues for the next few hours.

146
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:31,540
It's vital not to let anything to the southwest of the road burn out of control.

147
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,900
By 4 pm the outbreak is managed and attention can be directed back to the largest section

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,100
of the fire.

149
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,460
As the afternoon wears on some crews get back to lengthening the eastern fire line, others

150
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,860
begin constructing a western fire line, and the helicopter works on slowing the advancement

151
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,860
to the north.

152
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,620
By the time the sun begins to set around 8, all sides of the fire have at least some element

153
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,020
of control so that during the night and in the coming days the fire can continue to burn

154
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,620
in a controlled fashion until there's nothing left to burn.

155
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,500
This mission was a success but the reality is that this is not a real fire.

156
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,020
Real fires rarely end this well.

157
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,100
Real fires don't act so predictably because real fires can't be predicted.

158
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,660
Real fires are a menace that can grow to the size of small countries and can burn for months.

159
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,340
During summer and fall there are often more than 100 large forest fires burning around

160
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,620
the US at any given time and thousands more around the world.

161
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,940
No firefighting effort is exactly like another but these are the primary techniques used

162
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,700
