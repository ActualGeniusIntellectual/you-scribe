6920	12120	It's 4 AM on a mid-August morning in the Northern California wilderness.
12120	15940	During a brief overnight storm, lightning strikes the top of a hill, ignites some dry
15940	18880	underbrush, and starts a wildfire.
18880	23660	It isn't until 6 AM as the sun rises that someone notices the fire—a hiker camping
23660	25040	on an overlooking hill.
25040	29920	As soon as the hiker's 911 call is received by the emergency dispatch center, they contact
29920	34780	CAL FIRE—the agency responsible for wildfire protection and management in California.
34780	38540	By 630, they call the Redding, California-based smokejumpers.
38540	42300	They are one of the most elite firefighting squads in the United States.
42300	47440	There are only 400 smokejumpers in the US and 40 of those are based here in Redding,
47440	48440	California.
48440	51400	They're essentially the rapid response team for wildfires.
51400	55600	Within 15 minutes of receiving the call, these smokejumpers are in their plane and taking
55600	56600	off.
56600	61140	It takes 20 minutes to fly the 50 miles to the fire site where they find a suitable tree-free
61140	65020	landing spot, jump, deploy their parachutes, and land.
65020	68920	The plane then circles back to parachute down boxes of equipment.
68920	72920	Smokejumpers carry with them enough supplies to last 72 hours completely self-supported—food,
72920	77040	water, shelter, safety equipment, and firefighting tools.
77040	79960	They follow the ridgeline and make their way to the fire.
79960	84520	Now, this is a small team and they need to decide how to prioritize what they do.
84520	88380	With the fire already having grown to 15 acres the team knows they're unlikely to
88380	92120	stop it on their own—backups are already on the way—so their priority is to slow
92120	94460	it down as much as possible.
94460	99260	There are four major factors that affect how fast a fire moves—how much fuel there is,
99260	102400	how wet the fuel is, the wind direction, and the slope.
102400	106040	The two factors that the team can immediately gauge that affect where the fire will move
106040	108600	fastest are the wind direction and slope.
108600	112140	In this case the wind is coming from the north and they know that to the southwest is an
112140	113360	upward slope.
113360	118040	Fire moves faster uphill than it does downhill since the fire burns upwards so these smokejumpers
118040	121720	know that this is likely the fire's fastest moving front.
121720	126200	While trees do burn, the primary source of fuel that a wildfire uses to move is the dry
126200	130720	brush and dead wood on the forest floor so the biggest technique used to stop forest
130720	133680	fires is to create what's called a fire line.
133680	138340	These are essentially a gap where they remove all fuel—plants both dead and alive—so
138340	140900	that there's nothing for the fire to continue burning.
140900	145560	The smokejumpers use a mix of chainsaws and other hand tools to do this work but sometimes
145560	147460	fire lines are pre-built.
147460	151260	In this case, there's a road at the top of the uphill section which will help slow
151260	154420	or stop the fire so they can direct their efforts elsewhere.
154420	158820	They use the road as their anchor point—a cleared section that the fire likely won't
158820	163100	cross where they start building their fire lines so the fire can't outflank them.
163100	167060	Throughout this construction process the smokejumpers need to be sure that they can escape in case
167060	170020	the wind shift or the fire picks up speed.
170020	174460	Firefighters can move exceptionally fast—up to 7 miles per hour in forests which is faster
174460	177620	than humans are often able to make their way through dense trees.
177620	182340	In grasslands fires can move up to 14 miles per hour so firefighters have to be extra
182340	183340	cautious.
183340	187580	For this reason firefighters rarely put themselves directly in front of the fires moving front—they'll
187580	189780	either be far ahead or to the side.
189780	193060	In the case of this fire, as they're building this first fire line they're close to a
193060	198380	road which acts as an easy exit point but, just in case, all smokejumpers carry fire
198380	199380	shelters.
199740	203080	These compact, lightweight shelters won't survive direct flames for too long but they
203080	207380	do greatly increase a firefighter's chance of survival in case they can't escape the
207380	208940	path of a fire.
208940	213660	After a little over an hour of work, the smokejumpers complete a continuous fire line from the road
213660	214660	to a stream.
214660	219220	Streams, while less secure than roads, also help stop or slow down a fire by acting as
219220	220220	a fire line.
220220	224000	To the southeast of the fire there's also a small road that connects to another stream
224000	228180	meaning there are at least rudimentary fire lines on three sides of the fire.
228180	231060	It's at this time when backups arrive by road.
231060	234080	The added manpower allows for much faster action.
234080	238020	The immediate focus goes to strengthening the southeastern fire line—currently just
238020	239020	a stream.
239020	243200	At closest, the fire's less than 100 feet from the stream and the stream is itself in
243200	247200	a valley so it's too risky to work directly behind the stream—there's just no good
247200	251940	escape route—so the new arrivals get to work on a redundant fire line 100 feet behind
251940	252940	the stream.
252940	257860	By 10 AM the fire has further grown and the team knows that the worst is still to come.
257860	262820	Fire spreads most rapidly between 10 AM and sunset due to the daytime heat and wind.
262820	266880	By 11 AM the fire has reached the road and part of the fire line which means that some
266880	270640	of those who are building the fire line are reallocated to make sure that the fire line
270640	274020	holds, extinguishing any flames that may jump the road.
274020	278780	By noon the fire lines are holding and, while the fire size is growing, it's at a manageable
278780	283400	pace so there's reasonable hope that it can be suppressed before expanding to an uncontrollable
283400	284400	size.
284400	286780	At 1 PM, though, conditions change.
286780	290940	The wind starts blowing harder towards the southwest and, as trees burn on the north
290940	295500	side of the road, the wind pushes embers over the road which ignite underbrush on the other
295500	300000	side and now the entire focus of the firefighting efforts change.
300000	304860	You see, the point of fighting wildfires is not actually to put them out—it's to control
304860	305860	them.
305860	309940	While the number of wildfires has increased due to humans, they're actually a very natural
309940	310940	phenomenon.
310940	314420	What's making wildfires worse is humans stopping them.
314420	319180	Many forests survive wildfire through trees having heat-resistant bark and other evolutionary
319180	320260	adaptations.
320260	324780	These fire-resistant forests relied on having wildfires at a consistent interval every few
324780	329300	decades to clear out the forest floor of dead plants and to kill invasive species.
329300	334380	Nowadays, though, as humans suppress fires a forest might only see a wildfire every 50
334380	338460	years instead of 25, for example, meaning that there's twice as much fuel and so the
338460	341880	fire burns faster, larger, and more intensely.
341880	345820	It was only until recent years that the research revealing this was widely accepted so the
345820	350280	goals of firefighting shifted from stopping wildfires completely to controlling them.
350280	355000	In some places, being a firefighter actually means starting fires.
355000	359640	Fire management agencies will conduct controlled burns in order to reduce the risk of an uncontrollable
359640	362480	fire and to increase the health of a forest.
362480	367240	While forests can survive wildfires, humans cannot so most agencies will let fires burn
367240	371280	in a controlled fashion up until the moment they risk damaging property or threatening
371320	372680	human life.
372680	375960	This fire that jumped the road just did exactly that.
375960	380040	At the bottom of this slope is a town and the fire is now headed in that direction with
380040	382720	no pre-existing features to stop it.
382720	386620	That means that all measures must be taken to aggressively stop the fire's expansion
386620	387800	to the west.
387800	390120	That means it's time to bring out the big guns.
390120	393120	It's time to attack the fire from above.
393120	397680	Planes and helicopters are some of the most effective tools used to fight wildfires.
397680	402040	They can quickly and accurately drop huge amounts of water or fire retardant.
402040	406480	The decision to use aerial firefighting does not come lightly as it's both hugely expensive
406480	410360	and using an aircraft on one fire means it can't be used on another.
410360	413520	Their use needs to be prioritized for the most dangerous fires.
413520	418280	There's also a decision to be made on what the aircraft is going to drop—water or flame
418280	419460	retardant.
419460	423720	Water is cheap and with some aircraft designs can be reloaded near the fire without landing
423720	425080	at an airport.
425080	428220	Water is only effective at extinguishing flames, though.
428220	432040	Flame retardant, on the other hand, can be used to stop flames from starting.
432040	436100	It can essentially create a fire line ahead of the fire spread as it will stop a line
436100	437620	of forest from burning.
437620	442160	The main issues, though, are that flame retardant can only be loaded at an airport and it's
442160	443760	very expensive.
443760	448560	A gallon of Foschek, the most commonly used brand of flame retardant, costs $3.
448560	453060	That's about the same as a gallon of milk at the grocery store but these aircraft use
453060	456100	thousands of gallons of it for each drop.
456100	460900	The world's largest firefighting aircraft, the 747 supertanker, for example, carries
460900	466940	19,600 gallons of flame retardant meaning that what it uses in one drop costs nearly
466940	468740	$60,000.
468740	472580	Of course there's a reason agencies hire this plane—it creates a three mile long
472580	476720	fire line almost instantly, but it comes at a steep price.
476720	480100	For this fire, using such an expensive tool would be overkill.
480140	483220	In this case, they'll use a helicopter with a bucket attached.
483220	486940	The bucket is filled with water from a nearby lake then the helicopter flies over to the
486940	488400	fire and drops it.
488400	492640	With only five miles to the lake, the helicopter is able to make a drop about every five to
492640	497160	ten minutes and, while it works on stopping the spread on one side, hand crews work on
497160	499100	building a fire line on the other.
499100	503580	The area that the helicopter extinguishes essentially acts as its own fire line as fire
503580	505380	can't burn what's already burned.
505380	507340	This work continues for the next few hours.
507580	511540	It's vital not to let anything to the southwest of the road burn out of control.
511540	515900	By 4 pm the outbreak is managed and attention can be directed back to the largest section
515900	517100	of the fire.
517100	521460	As the afternoon wears on some crews get back to lengthening the eastern fire line, others
521460	525860	begin constructing a western fire line, and the helicopter works on slowing the advancement
525860	526860	to the north.
526860	531620	By the time the sun begins to set around 8, all sides of the fire have at least some element
531620	536020	of control so that during the night and in the coming days the fire can continue to burn
536020	539620	in a controlled fashion until there's nothing left to burn.
539620	544500	This mission was a success but the reality is that this is not a real fire.
544500	547020	Real fires rarely end this well.
547020	552100	Real fires don't act so predictably because real fires can't be predicted.
552100	557660	Real fires are a menace that can grow to the size of small countries and can burn for months.
557660	562340	During summer and fall there are often more than 100 large forest fires burning around
562340	566620	the US at any given time and thousands more around the world.
566620	570940	No firefighting effort is exactly like another but these are the primary techniques used
570940	575700	by those who work every day to protect life and property from one of nature's most dangerous
575700	577700	phenomenons.
577700	581060	Whether you're fighting forest fires or running a business, the tools you use are
581060	582460	crucially important.
582460	587220	In both cases, they directly affect how well you do your job and, while chainsaws, axes,
