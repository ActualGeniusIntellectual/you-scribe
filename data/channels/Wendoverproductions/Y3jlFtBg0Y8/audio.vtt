00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
What's the easternmost point in the US?

00:06.880 --> 00:10.160
Well it's actually a more complicated question than you may think.

00:10.160 --> 00:12.000
The simple answer would be Maine.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.920
Sail rock Maine to be specific.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.720
And if you said this answer you would be right, but only in one way of looking at the easternmost

00:17.720 --> 00:18.720
point.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.000
This is only right if you think of the easternmost point in the United States as relative to

00:23.000 --> 00:27.800
the United States itself and looking at the US as only the 50 states of the US, but you

00:27.800 --> 00:30.760
have to remember the overseas territories of the US.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.960
In this case, if we include the territories of the US, not including embassies, bases,

00:34.960 --> 00:39.760
or war cemeteries which are technically US soil, but not US territories, the easternmost

00:39.760 --> 00:45.080
point in the US relative to the mainland United States would be Point Udall in the US Virgin

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
Islands.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.520
Interestingly, the westernmost point in the United States relative to the United States

00:50.520 --> 00:55.620
is also named Point Udall, this time in Guam, but that's a topic for another time.

00:55.660 --> 01:00.380
So these easternmost points are all talking about east relative to the US, but we must

01:00.380 --> 01:03.460
remember that's not really what east is.

01:03.460 --> 01:08.300
East is a relative term, and in its true sense, it's all about longitude.

01:08.300 --> 01:12.980
East essentially means to the right of the prime meridian line, while west is to the

01:12.980 --> 01:13.980
left.

01:13.980 --> 01:17.740
So when we look at Alaska, which includes a long line of islands called the Aleutian

01:17.740 --> 01:23.000
Islands, we see that what was west eventually becomes east because this island chain actually

01:23.000 --> 01:28.800
crosses the 180th line of longitude, the exact opposite of the prime meridian.

01:28.800 --> 01:34.160
Therefore the closest island to the west of the prime meridian, Semisopuchenoe Island,

01:34.160 --> 01:38.080
holds the title of being the easternmost point in the United States.

01:38.080 --> 01:41.960
Now this creates a very interesting paradox where the easternmost point in the United

01:41.960 --> 01:46.640
States is actually west in terms of direction of travel of the westernmost point of the

01:46.640 --> 01:51.440
United States, Amatinak Island, by about 30 miles.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.560
This is of course assuming that you're looking at the westernmost and easternmost points

01:55.560 --> 01:57.800
in terms of longitude.

01:57.800 --> 02:02.960
Now to finish off, this creates one more paradox where Alaska holds the title of being the

02:02.960 --> 02:08.520
northernmost, westernmost, and easternmost state all at the same time.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.440
Okay.

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
Thank you.

02:23.440 --> 02:24.440
Thank you.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.440
Thank you.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
Thank you.

02:26.440 --> 02:27.440
Thank you.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.440
Thank you.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
Thank you.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.440
Thank you.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.440
Thank you.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.440
Thank you.

02:32.440 --> 02:33.440
Thank you.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.440
Thank you.

02:34.440 --> 02:35.440
Thank you.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
Thank you.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
Thank you.

02:37.440 --> 02:38.440
Thank you.

02:38.440 --> 02:39.440
Thank you.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.440
Thank you.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.440
Thank you.

02:41.440 --> 02:42.440
Thank you.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.440
Thank you.

02:43.440 --> 02:43.940
Thank you.
