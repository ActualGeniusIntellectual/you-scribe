0	6880	What's the easternmost point in the US?
6880	10160	Well it's actually a more complicated question than you may think.
10160	12000	The simple answer would be Maine.
12000	13920	Sail rock Maine to be specific.
13920	17720	And if you said this answer you would be right, but only in one way of looking at the easternmost
17720	18720	point.
18720	23000	This is only right if you think of the easternmost point in the United States as relative to
23000	27800	the United States itself and looking at the US as only the 50 states of the US, but you
27800	30760	have to remember the overseas territories of the US.
30760	34960	In this case, if we include the territories of the US, not including embassies, bases,
34960	39760	or war cemeteries which are technically US soil, but not US territories, the easternmost
39760	45080	point in the US relative to the mainland United States would be Point Udall in the US Virgin
45080	46080	Islands.
46080	50520	Interestingly, the westernmost point in the United States relative to the United States
50520	55620	is also named Point Udall, this time in Guam, but that's a topic for another time.
55660	60380	So these easternmost points are all talking about east relative to the US, but we must
60380	63460	remember that's not really what east is.
63460	68300	East is a relative term, and in its true sense, it's all about longitude.
68300	72980	East essentially means to the right of the prime meridian line, while west is to the
72980	73980	left.
73980	77740	So when we look at Alaska, which includes a long line of islands called the Aleutian
77740	83000	Islands, we see that what was west eventually becomes east because this island chain actually
83000	88800	crosses the 180th line of longitude, the exact opposite of the prime meridian.
88800	94160	Therefore the closest island to the west of the prime meridian, Semisopuchenoe Island,
94160	98080	holds the title of being the easternmost point in the United States.
98080	101960	Now this creates a very interesting paradox where the easternmost point in the United
101960	106640	States is actually west in terms of direction of travel of the westernmost point of the
106640	111440	United States, Amatinak Island, by about 30 miles.
111440	115560	This is of course assuming that you're looking at the westernmost and easternmost points
115560	117800	in terms of longitude.
117800	122960	Now to finish off, this creates one more paradox where Alaska holds the title of being the
122960	128520	northernmost, westernmost, and easternmost state all at the same time.
