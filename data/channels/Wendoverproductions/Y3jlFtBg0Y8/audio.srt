1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
What's the easternmost point in the US?

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,160
Well it's actually a more complicated question than you may think.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,000
The simple answer would be Maine.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
Sail rock Maine to be specific.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,720
And if you said this answer you would be right, but only in one way of looking at the easternmost

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,720
point.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,000
This is only right if you think of the easternmost point in the United States as relative to

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,800
the United States itself and looking at the US as only the 50 states of the US, but you

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,760
have to remember the overseas territories of the US.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,960
In this case, if we include the territories of the US, not including embassies, bases,

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,760
or war cemeteries which are technically US soil, but not US territories, the easternmost

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,080
point in the US relative to the mainland United States would be Point Udall in the US Virgin

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Islands.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,520
Interestingly, the westernmost point in the United States relative to the United States

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,620
is also named Point Udall, this time in Guam, but that's a topic for another time.

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,380
So these easternmost points are all talking about east relative to the US, but we must

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,460
remember that's not really what east is.

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,300
East is a relative term, and in its true sense, it's all about longitude.

19
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,980
East essentially means to the right of the prime meridian line, while west is to the

20
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:13,980
left.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,740
So when we look at Alaska, which includes a long line of islands called the Aleutian

22
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,000
Islands, we see that what was west eventually becomes east because this island chain actually

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,800
crosses the 180th line of longitude, the exact opposite of the prime meridian.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,160
Therefore the closest island to the west of the prime meridian, Semisopuchenoe Island,

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,080
holds the title of being the easternmost point in the United States.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,960
Now this creates a very interesting paradox where the easternmost point in the United

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,640
States is actually west in terms of direction of travel of the westernmost point of the

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,440
United States, Amatinak Island, by about 30 miles.

29
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,560
This is of course assuming that you're looking at the westernmost and easternmost points

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,800
in terms of longitude.

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,960
Now to finish off, this creates one more paradox where Alaska holds the title of being the

32
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,520
northernmost, westernmost, and easternmost state all at the same time.

33
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Okay.

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Thank you.

35
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Thank you.

36
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Thank you.

37
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
Thank you.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Thank you.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Thank you.

40
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Thank you.

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Thank you.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Thank you.

43
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Thank you.

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Thank you.

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
Thank you.

46
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,440
Thank you.

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Thank you.

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Thank you.

49
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
Thank you.

50
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
Thank you.

51
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Thank you.

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Thank you.

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Thank you.

54
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Thank you.

55
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,940
Thank you.
