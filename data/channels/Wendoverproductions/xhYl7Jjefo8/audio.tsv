0	4480	Three months ago, we released HAI's Crime Spree as a Nebula Original.
4480	9400	It was something experimental and riskyâ€”a live-action travel competition show where
9400	14220	instead of contestants traveling to the competitions, travel was the competition.
14220	17360	We loved making it, but we didn't know how much you all would love watching it.
17360	19200	But the response was overwhelming.
19200	22740	From Reddit comments to emails to people coming up to me on the street, you all made it clear
22740	25880	that you loved it and that you wanted more.
25880	29800	So we asked ourselves, if Crime Spree was a show on a YouTube channel, what would that
29800	30800	YouTube channel be?
30800	37720	What's come out of that is Wendover's first-ever live-action YouTube channel, Jetlag The Game.
55880	56880	So this is when this gets hard.
56880	59880	We just got to win a race around the world.
60880	63880	Welcome to Sacramento.
63880	64880	We're here in Nevada.
64880	65880	We're in Kansas.
65880	67880	We are here in Milan, Italy.
67880	68880	The tour's closed in five minutes.
68880	69880	I'm going.
69880	70880	I'm pleading.
72880	73880	This is a lot of pressure.
73880	75880	This is the greatest moment of my life.
75880	76880	All right, let's go, go, go.
79880	80880	Oh God.
80880	81880	Oh, okay.
81880	82880	How?
82880	83880	The security's bad.
83880	84880	We're screwed.
84880	85880	Let's deal with it.
90880	92880	We've been out for a long time.
101880	105880	I can't even begin to describe how excited I am to finally launch this.
105880	109880	Each season we're playing a new travel-based competition game across new locations.
109880	113880	The first season, which starts releasing today, is the game Connect Four, but instead of connecting
113880	116880	tiles, we're connecting real American states.
116880	120880	Myself and Brian from Real Engineering compete against the half as interesting writers, Ben
120880	124880	and Adam, racing to state capitals to draw a card, complete the challenge it describes,
124880	125880	and claim the state.
125880	128880	Once we connect four, either horizontally or vertically, we win.
128880	132880	The first episode of that is out right now at the link on screen, in the description,
132880	134880	or at the little i button in the top right corner of your screen.
134880	139880	But the drama only rises in episodes two and three, so be sure to subscribe and come back
139880	140880	each week for those.
140880	144880	Then, after a short break, we'll release season two where we go international with
144880	145880	a brand new game.
145880	150880	To be honest, we've sunk a huge amount of time and budget into this channel, so it would
150880	152880	mean a lot to us if you at least gave it a try.
152880	156880	But I think anyone who loves travel and transportation will love this show, so since you're already
156880	158880	watching Wendover, this'll probably be for you.
158880	162880	Once again, just click the link in the description to head over to the Jetlag The Game channel,
162880	166880	and thanks in advance for supporting the newest addition to the Wendover network of channels.
