00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Three months ago, we released HAI's Crime Spree as a Nebula Original.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,400
It was something experimental and riskyâ€”a live-action travel competition show where

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,220
instead of contestants traveling to the competitions, travel was the competition.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,360
We loved making it, but we didn't know how much you all would love watching it.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,200
But the response was overwhelming.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,740
From Reddit comments to emails to people coming up to me on the street, you all made it clear

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,880
that you loved it and that you wanted more.

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,800
So we asked ourselves, if Crime Spree was a show on a YouTube channel, what would that

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
YouTube channel be?

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,720
What's come out of that is Wendover's first-ever live-action YouTube channel, Jetlag The Game.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,880
So this is when this gets hard.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,880
We just got to win a race around the world.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Welcome to Sacramento.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
We're here in Nevada.

15
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
We're in Kansas.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,880
We are here in Milan, Italy.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
The tour's closed in five minutes.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm going.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm pleading.

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
This is a lot of pressure.

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,880
This is the greatest moment of my life.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
All right, let's go, go, go.

23
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Oh God.

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,880
Oh, okay.

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,880
How?

26
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
The security's bad.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
We're screwed.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Let's deal with it.

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,880
We've been out for a long time.

30
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,880
I can't even begin to describe how excited I am to finally launch this.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,880
Each season we're playing a new travel-based competition game across new locations.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,880
The first season, which starts releasing today, is the game Connect Four, but instead of connecting

33
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,880
tiles, we're connecting real American states.

34
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Myself and Brian from Real Engineering compete against the half as interesting writers, Ben

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
and Adam, racing to state capitals to draw a card, complete the challenge it describes,

36
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
and claim the state.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Once we connect four, either horizontally or vertically, we win.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,880
The first episode of that is out right now at the link on screen, in the description,

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
or at the little i button in the top right corner of your screen.

40
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,880
But the drama only rises in episodes two and three, so be sure to subscribe and come back

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
each week for those.

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,880
Then, after a short break, we'll release season two where we go international with

43
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,880
a brand new game.

44
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,880
To be honest, we've sunk a huge amount of time and budget into this channel, so it would

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
mean a lot to us if you at least gave it a try.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,880
But I think anyone who loves travel and transportation will love this show, so since you're already

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,880
watching Wendover, this'll probably be for you.

48
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,880
Once again, just click the link in the description to head over to the Jetlag The Game channel,

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,880
and thanks in advance for supporting the newest addition to the Wendover network of channels.
