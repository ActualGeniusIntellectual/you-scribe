00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
Three months ago, we released HAI's Crime Spree as a Nebula Original.

00:04.480 --> 00:09.400
It was something experimental and riskyâ€”a live-action travel competition show where

00:09.400 --> 00:14.220
instead of contestants traveling to the competitions, travel was the competition.

00:14.220 --> 00:17.360
We loved making it, but we didn't know how much you all would love watching it.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.200
But the response was overwhelming.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.740
From Reddit comments to emails to people coming up to me on the street, you all made it clear

00:22.740 --> 00:25.880
that you loved it and that you wanted more.

00:25.880 --> 00:29.800
So we asked ourselves, if Crime Spree was a show on a YouTube channel, what would that

00:29.800 --> 00:30.800
YouTube channel be?

00:30.800 --> 00:37.720
What's come out of that is Wendover's first-ever live-action YouTube channel, Jetlag The Game.

00:55.880 --> 00:56.880
So this is when this gets hard.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.880
We just got to win a race around the world.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.880
Welcome to Sacramento.

01:03.880 --> 01:04.880
We're here in Nevada.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.880
We're in Kansas.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.880
We are here in Milan, Italy.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.880
The tour's closed in five minutes.

01:08.880 --> 01:09.880
I'm going.

01:09.880 --> 01:10.880
I'm pleading.

01:12.880 --> 01:13.880
This is a lot of pressure.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.880
This is the greatest moment of my life.

01:15.880 --> 01:16.880
All right, let's go, go, go.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
Oh God.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.880
Oh, okay.

01:21.880 --> 01:22.880
How?

01:22.880 --> 01:23.880
The security's bad.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
We're screwed.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Let's deal with it.

01:30.880 --> 01:32.880
We've been out for a long time.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.880
I can't even begin to describe how excited I am to finally launch this.

01:45.880 --> 01:49.880
Each season we're playing a new travel-based competition game across new locations.

01:49.880 --> 01:53.880
The first season, which starts releasing today, is the game Connect Four, but instead of connecting

01:53.880 --> 01:56.880
tiles, we're connecting real American states.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.880
Myself and Brian from Real Engineering compete against the half as interesting writers, Ben

02:00.880 --> 02:04.880
and Adam, racing to state capitals to draw a card, complete the challenge it describes,

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
and claim the state.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.880
Once we connect four, either horizontally or vertically, we win.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.880
The first episode of that is out right now at the link on screen, in the description,

02:12.880 --> 02:14.880
or at the little i button in the top right corner of your screen.

02:14.880 --> 02:19.880
But the drama only rises in episodes two and three, so be sure to subscribe and come back

02:19.880 --> 02:20.880
each week for those.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.880
Then, after a short break, we'll release season two where we go international with

02:24.880 --> 02:25.880
a brand new game.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.880
To be honest, we've sunk a huge amount of time and budget into this channel, so it would

02:30.880 --> 02:32.880
mean a lot to us if you at least gave it a try.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.880
But I think anyone who loves travel and transportation will love this show, so since you're already

02:36.880 --> 02:38.880
watching Wendover, this'll probably be for you.

02:38.880 --> 02:42.880
Once again, just click the link in the description to head over to the Jetlag The Game channel,

02:42.880 --> 02:46.880
and thanks in advance for supporting the newest addition to the Wendover network of channels.
