1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
Following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, a deal was reached between

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,080
Gaddafi of Libya and the British government in which the trial of the accused bombers

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,520
would happen in a neutral country in return for the extradition of the accused bombers.

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,520
The Netherlands agreed to host the trial, and so a portion of the Netherlands, a former

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,620
NATO base called Camp Zeist, became a piece of Scottish land in the Netherlands.

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:34,620
This land was part of Scotland, with Scottish police officers, Scottish judges, and Scottish

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,620
law.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,360
Thus, the court established on the site for the proceedings was dubbed the Scottish Court

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,760
in the Netherlands.

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,400
Following the trial and a subsequent appeal, the land was ceded back to the Netherlands.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,380
But for that short time, Scotland was just a tiny bit bigger.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,700
Across the channel in the area that's always Scotland, there are two islands called Westerly

13
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,500
and Papa Westerly.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,760
The airports of these two islands can boast that between them runs the shortest regularly

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,340
scheduled commercial flight in the world.

16
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,740
It takes a mere minute, costs 17 pounds, and travels 1.7 milesâ€”roughly the same distance

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,340
as the runway of the airport of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,500
There are a number of places also called Edinburgh around the world, but the coolest is Edinburgh

19
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
of the Seven Seas.

20
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,340
Located on the British overseas territory island of Tristan, Nakuna, Edinburgh of the

21
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,880
Seven Seas is considered to be the most remote inhabited place on earth.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,380
The island is 1,200 miles from the closest other inhabited place, the island of St Helena,

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,740
and 1,500 miles from the nearest continental land, South Africa.

24
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,060
There's no airport and no regular transport links off the island.

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,520
The only way the 300 residents can reach the rest of the world is by hitching a ride on

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,380
a fishing boat, and those only come 8 or 9 times a year.

27
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,900
At 64 square miles, Tristan Nakuna is the 1,060th largest island in the world, but the

28
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,100
8th largest island in the world is Victoria Island, Canada.

29
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,220
On Victoria Island, there's a lake, which is home to an island, which has a lake on

30
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,780
it, with one more island.

31
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,300
This tiny 4 acre island is so remote that it's thought that no human has ever set

32
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,540
foot on it.

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,620
Victoria Island, the island that holds the lake that holds the island that has the lake

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:24,700
with this island, is slightly bigger than Great Britain, yet has a population of less

35
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,520
than 2,000.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Also in Canada, but much farther south, is Vancouver.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,220
About 22 miles south of downtown Vancouver is Point Roberts, Washington, which is part

38
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,420
of the United States, however you cannot get to the rest of the United States without crossing

39
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,020
into Canada.

40
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:45,500
This is because Point Roberts lies south of the 49th parallel, which constitutes much

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,120
of the border between the two countries.

42
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,320
A few thousand miles to the east, the border isn't quite as nice and straight.

43
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,160
In Detroit, you counterintuitively have to travel south to get to Canada, America's

44
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,600
northern neighbor.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,640
Also counterintuitively, the westernmost point of Virginia is actually more westerly than

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,560
the westernmost point of West Virginia.

47
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,720
And to finish off the counterintuitivelys, the eastern end of the Panama Canal flows

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,820
into the Pacific Ocean, the ocean to the west, while the western end of the Panama Canal

49
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,440
flows into the Atlantic Ocean, the ocean to the east.

50
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
And while we're so close to South America, I might as well mention that there are no

51
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,480
bridges over the Amazon River, the second longest river in the world.

52
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,000
This is not because the river is too wide or anything, but rather because pretty much

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,660
nobody lives around the Amazon.

54
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,260
There is actually only one bridge over any of the major tributaries to the Amazon as

55
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,540
well.

56
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,540
For the few roads there are that cross the Amazon, ferries connect the two sides.

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,160
To finish it off, let's head over to Afghanistan, which has a time zone of UTC plus 4 hours

58
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,540
and 30 minutes.

59
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,000
They're one of a few nations in the world that align themselves to a half hour difference

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,420
compared to universal time.

61
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:02,700
Afghanistan shares a brief 47 mile border with China, which has one time zone for the

62
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,660
entire country.

63
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:11,120
This means that if you step across the Afghanistan-China border, you travel 3.5 hours into the future,

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,200
and this is the greatest time zone change you can make in one step on earth.
