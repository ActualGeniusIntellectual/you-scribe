0	10640	Following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, a deal was reached between
10640	15080	Gaddafi of Libya and the British government in which the trial of the accused bombers
15080	20520	would happen in a neutral country in return for the extradition of the accused bombers.
20520	24520	The Netherlands agreed to host the trial, and so a portion of the Netherlands, a former
24520	29620	NATO base called Camp Zeist, became a piece of Scottish land in the Netherlands.
29620	34620	This land was part of Scotland, with Scottish police officers, Scottish judges, and Scottish
34620	35620	law.
35620	39360	Thus, the court established on the site for the proceedings was dubbed the Scottish Court
39360	40760	in the Netherlands.
40760	45400	Following the trial and a subsequent appeal, the land was ceded back to the Netherlands.
45400	50380	But for that short time, Scotland was just a tiny bit bigger.
50380	54700	Across the channel in the area that's always Scotland, there are two islands called Westerly
54700	56500	and Papa Westerly.
56500	60760	The airports of these two islands can boast that between them runs the shortest regularly
60760	63340	scheduled commercial flight in the world.
63340	69740	It takes a mere minute, costs 17 pounds, and travels 1.7 milesâ€”roughly the same distance
69740	74340	as the runway of the airport of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.
74340	78500	There are a number of places also called Edinburgh around the world, but the coolest is Edinburgh
78500	80500	of the Seven Seas.
80500	84340	Located on the British overseas territory island of Tristan, Nakuna, Edinburgh of the
84340	88880	Seven Seas is considered to be the most remote inhabited place on earth.
88880	94380	The island is 1,200 miles from the closest other inhabited place, the island of St Helena,
94380	98740	and 1,500 miles from the nearest continental land, South Africa.
98740	104060	There's no airport and no regular transport links off the island.
104060	108520	The only way the 300 residents can reach the rest of the world is by hitching a ride on
108520	112380	a fishing boat, and those only come 8 or 9 times a year.
112380	118900	At 64 square miles, Tristan Nakuna is the 1,060th largest island in the world, but the
118900	123100	8th largest island in the world is Victoria Island, Canada.
123100	128220	On Victoria Island, there's a lake, which is home to an island, which has a lake on
128220	130780	it, with one more island.
130780	135300	This tiny 4 acre island is so remote that it's thought that no human has ever set
135300	136540	foot on it.
136540	140620	Victoria Island, the island that holds the lake that holds the island that has the lake
140620	144700	with this island, is slightly bigger than Great Britain, yet has a population of less
144700	146520	than 2,000.
146520	150360	Also in Canada, but much farther south, is Vancouver.
150360	155220	About 22 miles south of downtown Vancouver is Point Roberts, Washington, which is part
155220	159420	of the United States, however you cannot get to the rest of the United States without crossing
159420	161020	into Canada.
161020	165500	This is because Point Roberts lies south of the 49th parallel, which constitutes much
165500	168120	of the border between the two countries.
168120	172320	A few thousand miles to the east, the border isn't quite as nice and straight.
172320	177160	In Detroit, you counterintuitively have to travel south to get to Canada, America's
177160	178600	northern neighbor.
178600	183640	Also counterintuitively, the westernmost point of Virginia is actually more westerly than
183640	186560	the westernmost point of West Virginia.
186560	190720	And to finish off the counterintuitivelys, the eastern end of the Panama Canal flows
190720	195820	into the Pacific Ocean, the ocean to the west, while the western end of the Panama Canal
195820	199440	flows into the Atlantic Ocean, the ocean to the east.
199440	202720	And while we're so close to South America, I might as well mention that there are no
202720	207480	bridges over the Amazon River, the second longest river in the world.
207480	211000	This is not because the river is too wide or anything, but rather because pretty much
211000	213660	nobody lives around the Amazon.
213660	217260	There is actually only one bridge over any of the major tributaries to the Amazon as
217260	218540	well.
218540	223540	For the few roads there are that cross the Amazon, ferries connect the two sides.
223540	229160	To finish it off, let's head over to Afghanistan, which has a time zone of UTC plus 4 hours
229160	230540	and 30 minutes.
230540	235000	They're one of a few nations in the world that align themselves to a half hour difference
235000	237420	compared to universal time.
237420	242700	Afghanistan shares a brief 47 mile border with China, which has one time zone for the
242700	244660	entire country.
244660	251120	This means that if you step across the Afghanistan-China border, you travel 3.5 hours into the future,
251120	255200	and this is the greatest time zone change you can make in one step on earth.
