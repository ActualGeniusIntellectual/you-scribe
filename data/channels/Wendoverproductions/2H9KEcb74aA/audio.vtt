00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
Following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland, a deal was reached between

00:10.640 --> 00:15.080
Gaddafi of Libya and the British government in which the trial of the accused bombers

00:15.080 --> 00:20.520
would happen in a neutral country in return for the extradition of the accused bombers.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.520
The Netherlands agreed to host the trial, and so a portion of the Netherlands, a former

00:24.520 --> 00:29.620
NATO base called Camp Zeist, became a piece of Scottish land in the Netherlands.

00:29.620 --> 00:34.620
This land was part of Scotland, with Scottish police officers, Scottish judges, and Scottish

00:34.620 --> 00:35.620
law.

00:35.620 --> 00:39.360
Thus, the court established on the site for the proceedings was dubbed the Scottish Court

00:39.360 --> 00:40.760
in the Netherlands.

00:40.760 --> 00:45.400
Following the trial and a subsequent appeal, the land was ceded back to the Netherlands.

00:45.400 --> 00:50.380
But for that short time, Scotland was just a tiny bit bigger.

00:50.380 --> 00:54.700
Across the channel in the area that's always Scotland, there are two islands called Westerly

00:54.700 --> 00:56.500
and Papa Westerly.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.760
The airports of these two islands can boast that between them runs the shortest regularly

01:00.760 --> 01:03.340
scheduled commercial flight in the world.

01:03.340 --> 01:09.740
It takes a mere minute, costs 17 pounds, and travels 1.7 milesâ€”roughly the same distance

01:09.740 --> 01:14.340
as the runway of the airport of Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland.

01:14.340 --> 01:18.500
There are a number of places also called Edinburgh around the world, but the coolest is Edinburgh

01:18.500 --> 01:20.500
of the Seven Seas.

01:20.500 --> 01:24.340
Located on the British overseas territory island of Tristan, Nakuna, Edinburgh of the

01:24.340 --> 01:28.880
Seven Seas is considered to be the most remote inhabited place on earth.

01:28.880 --> 01:34.380
The island is 1,200 miles from the closest other inhabited place, the island of St Helena,

01:34.380 --> 01:38.740
and 1,500 miles from the nearest continental land, South Africa.

01:38.740 --> 01:44.060
There's no airport and no regular transport links off the island.

01:44.060 --> 01:48.520
The only way the 300 residents can reach the rest of the world is by hitching a ride on

01:48.520 --> 01:52.380
a fishing boat, and those only come 8 or 9 times a year.

01:52.380 --> 01:58.900
At 64 square miles, Tristan Nakuna is the 1,060th largest island in the world, but the

01:58.900 --> 02:03.100
8th largest island in the world is Victoria Island, Canada.

02:03.100 --> 02:08.220
On Victoria Island, there's a lake, which is home to an island, which has a lake on

02:08.220 --> 02:10.780
it, with one more island.

02:10.780 --> 02:15.300
This tiny 4 acre island is so remote that it's thought that no human has ever set

02:15.300 --> 02:16.540
foot on it.

02:16.540 --> 02:20.620
Victoria Island, the island that holds the lake that holds the island that has the lake

02:20.620 --> 02:24.700
with this island, is slightly bigger than Great Britain, yet has a population of less

02:24.700 --> 02:26.520
than 2,000.

02:26.520 --> 02:30.360
Also in Canada, but much farther south, is Vancouver.

02:30.360 --> 02:35.220
About 22 miles south of downtown Vancouver is Point Roberts, Washington, which is part

02:35.220 --> 02:39.420
of the United States, however you cannot get to the rest of the United States without crossing

02:39.420 --> 02:41.020
into Canada.

02:41.020 --> 02:45.500
This is because Point Roberts lies south of the 49th parallel, which constitutes much

02:45.500 --> 02:48.120
of the border between the two countries.

02:48.120 --> 02:52.320
A few thousand miles to the east, the border isn't quite as nice and straight.

02:52.320 --> 02:57.160
In Detroit, you counterintuitively have to travel south to get to Canada, America's

02:57.160 --> 02:58.600
northern neighbor.

02:58.600 --> 03:03.640
Also counterintuitively, the westernmost point of Virginia is actually more westerly than

03:03.640 --> 03:06.560
the westernmost point of West Virginia.

03:06.560 --> 03:10.720
And to finish off the counterintuitivelys, the eastern end of the Panama Canal flows

03:10.720 --> 03:15.820
into the Pacific Ocean, the ocean to the west, while the western end of the Panama Canal

03:15.820 --> 03:19.440
flows into the Atlantic Ocean, the ocean to the east.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.720
And while we're so close to South America, I might as well mention that there are no

03:22.720 --> 03:27.480
bridges over the Amazon River, the second longest river in the world.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.000
This is not because the river is too wide or anything, but rather because pretty much

03:31.000 --> 03:33.660
nobody lives around the Amazon.

03:33.660 --> 03:37.260
There is actually only one bridge over any of the major tributaries to the Amazon as

03:37.260 --> 03:38.540
well.

03:38.540 --> 03:43.540
For the few roads there are that cross the Amazon, ferries connect the two sides.

03:43.540 --> 03:49.160
To finish it off, let's head over to Afghanistan, which has a time zone of UTC plus 4 hours

03:49.160 --> 03:50.540
and 30 minutes.

03:50.540 --> 03:55.000
They're one of a few nations in the world that align themselves to a half hour difference

03:55.000 --> 03:57.420
compared to universal time.

03:57.420 --> 04:02.700
Afghanistan shares a brief 47 mile border with China, which has one time zone for the

04:02.700 --> 04:04.660
entire country.

04:04.660 --> 04:11.120
This means that if you step across the Afghanistan-China border, you travel 3.5 hours into the future,

04:11.120 --> 04:15.200
and this is the greatest time zone change you can make in one step on earth.
