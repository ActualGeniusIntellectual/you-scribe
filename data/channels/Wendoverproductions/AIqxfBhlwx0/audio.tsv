0	2520	This is not a town.
2520	7380	It may look like a town, it may act like a town, but it is not one.
7380	13120	This is the Villages, a massive, sprawling, privately-owned, privately-operated retirement
13120	17400	community in Florida that easily ranks as the world's largest.
17400	21500	Driving from one corner to another would take some half-hour, and in that time one would
21500	28200	pass the suburban-style homes of over 130,000 people—all of whom, with rare exception,
28200	31060	were born before 1967.
31060	35280	Despite the entirely manufactured nature of the area, the 2020 census revealed that it
35280	39460	was the fastest-growing metro area in the US over the preceding decade, as it somehow
39460	43880	managed to manicure some sort of charm for some sort of person.
43880	49160	The Villages is centered by a town, or call it a grandiose strip mall, known as Lake Sumter
49160	50520	Landing.
50520	54160	Although it sits about as inland as one can get in the Sunshine States, it's themed
54160	58160	after a quaint seaside town, and even has plaques plastered throughout conveying the
58160	63680	history of the buildings—each entirely fictional, written to bolster the collective, Disney-world-esque
63680	68080	suspension of disbelief that starts the second one loses sight of the sprawling parking lot
68080	69080	that surrounds.
69080	74840	But once in the square, fanciful, incongruous buildings house a plethora of chain restaurants—Johnny
74840	80240	Rockets, Starbucks, Panera Bread, Haig & Doss—flanking around the central square where each night,
80240	86880	from five till nine, 365 days a year, some form of live entertainment takes place.
86880	91700	Beyond the bounds of Lake Sumter Landing and its parking lots, 71,000 suburban-style homes
91700	97320	are punctuated by 53 golf courses and over 100 recreation centers boasting pools, pickleball
97320	101520	courts, gyms, and other facilities that host a deluge of daily clubs and activities.
101520	105680	The Bone Builders Exercise Class, the Women's Parkinson's Caregiver Support Group, the
105680	109760	Villages Lightsaber Club, the Long Island Couples Club, the Northwest Ohio Club, the
109800	116000	Cleveland and Northeast Ohio Club, the Texas Social Club, the options stack up and up.
116000	120080	And these state-related clubs paint a fairly consistent picture of the places that villages
120080	121720	residents come from.
121720	125840	Overwhelmingly, these are middle-class Americans from middle America looking to upgrade their
125840	130800	quality of life with warm weather, low cost of living, and a lack of state income tax.
130800	135360	Despite having no restrictions on who can move in aside from an age minimum of 55, the
135360	138400	Villages undoubtedly attracts a particular type of person.
138400	143460	68.8% of its residents voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2020, and according
143460	147040	to the same year's census, 98% of residents are white.
147040	149520	But that's just the villages.
149520	154680	Three and a half hours to the south, Cape Coral perhaps serves as a villages for a younger
154680	155680	generation.
155680	160960	It, too, is predominantly white, predominantly conservative, predominantly Midwestern, but
160960	162840	more mixed in age.
162840	166760	In place of the core superlative status as the world's largest retirement community,
166760	171880	Cape Coral postures as the city with the world's largest system of navigable canals—over
171880	178480	400 miles or 650 kilometers worth, each painstakingly dredged to grant nearly every lot that valuable
178480	183640	waterfront status and, through a zig-zagging path, boat access to the ocean.
183640	187480	But it was not as ingenious a plan as it first may seem.
187480	191440	In fact, little planning at all went into the development of Cape Coral.
191440	195120	The story is more of its developers making an overzealous land purchase than figuring
195120	197280	it out as they went along.
197280	200640	Selling lots to primarily distant buyers, they didn't really need to focus on the
200640	201700	details.
201700	207160	Few services or amenities existed at the start, and still today, these are few and far between.
207160	211220	Certain areas are a full 15-minute drive away from their nearest supermarket.
211220	214640	With few businesses to generate sales tax revenue, the local government's commercial
214640	219800	tax base is abnormally low, and with a predominantly conservative, anti-tax voter base, the city
219800	223760	has often struggled to find the funding for critical infrastructure projects.
223760	228640	Water, both too much and too little of it, has long been the peninsula's most persistent
228640	229700	problem.
229700	234920	In the early days, there was essentially zero plan for how to get freshwater to residents.
234920	237880	Developers just told buyers they could just build a well on their lot to tap into the
237880	242180	groundwater below, but there wasn't enough of it, and there was even less after the development
242180	245440	of the area disrupted the aquifer's natural recharge process.
245440	249020	Eventually, the burgeoning local government recognized the issue and started building
249020	254460	a central supply system, but it too was relying on the same, inadequate underground aquifer,
254460	258260	digging deeper and deeper as the water table dropped further and further.
258260	262460	Eventually, the city invested in a reverse osmosis plant to turn increasingly marginal
262460	266780	groundwater potable and a reclamation system to stretch that supply further, but continued
266780	270660	underinvestment has meant that, despite being located in one of the rainiest regions of
270660	275500	America, Cape Coral regularly encounters water shortages that spur legally enforced watering
275500	279620	restrictions and quality issues that have pushed water safe to drink up to one of the
279620	284380	top Google autocomplete suggestions when one types is Cape Coral.
284380	287260	But still, growth prevails.
287260	291580	Where else can you get a sunny, waterfront lot with an ocean access dock for less than
291580	294260	$50,000?
294260	298260	But there's still an entirely different class of transplant beyond the retirees and
298260	300740	the middle-class Midwesterners.
300740	306180	Directly opposite Cape Coral, three hours away on the Atlantic coast, sits Palm Beach.
306180	311640	A natural, 18-mile, 29-kilometer long barrier island physically separated from the mainland,
311640	315020	but connected to it by four short bridges.
315020	319680	The island is centered around the massive, storied Breakers Resort, and narrows and narrows
319680	323340	until it reaches just one mega-mansion in width.
323340	333220	These homes sell for inconceivable amounts—$47 million, $110 million, $46 million, $43 million—but
333220	337560	their owners likely only spend just six months and one day in them to attain coveted Florida
337560	341540	resident status and the lack of state income tax it conveys.
341540	346680	Palm Beach, as a phenomenon, essentially exists only between Thanksgiving and Easter, which
346680	351440	referred to as the season when temperatures up north stay cold, hurricanes stay away,
351440	356020	and the nuisance of off-season maintenance stays hidden, but during that period, it truly
356020	358620	is a phenomenon.
358620	362740	Over the winter months, this pencil of an island becomes the global center of gravity
362740	365900	for wealthy, conservative Americans.
365900	369500	While increasingly recognized today thanks to the current full-time residency of former
369500	373820	President Trump at his resort on the island, other central figures of his political party
373820	375680	laid roots long before.
375680	379960	Disgraced former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes lived in his $36 million mansion up until
379960	383920	his death, prominent radio host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh owned a mansion
383920	388980	listed for over $100 million after his death, and failed Republican Senate nominee for Pennsylvania
388980	394380	Dr. Mehmet Oz bought an $18 million, 10-bedroom, 14-bathroom beachfront mansion on the island
394380	396180	in 2018.
396180	401160	All controversial figures, they each undoubtedly appreciate the privacy and exclusivity that
401160	404940	have become known as Palm Beach's core competencies.
404940	407220	Little is public on the island.
407220	411820	Saved for a small, rather unremarkable downtown, the Palm Beach experience is defined by visits
411820	415620	within the walls of neighboring megamansions, or nights at the Everglades Club, the Palm
415620	420400	Beach Bath and Tennis Club, Mar-a-Lago, or any one of the other extremely expensive,
420400	422880	extremely exclusive social clubs on the island.
422880	426960	For those without the means, there's truly little to do so they merely come for work,
426960	429700	then commute back over the bridge to West Palm Beach.
429700	433760	This maintains the social bubble around the island and its residents, shielding them from
433760	436640	real-world quarrels stemming from their reputation.
436640	443400	It's a strange spot, an informal, yet remarkably consistent aberration, and it's in a state
443400	446840	full of remarkably consistent aberrations.
446840	452600	Somehow, this massive peninsula has bred a landscape of truly bizarre, individually unique
452600	453600	places.
453600	457760	Beyond the villages, Cape Coral, and Palm Beach, there's an entire city-sized economy
457760	463000	undergirded by theme parks, there's a linear, inter-island community connected by 125 miles
463040	467980	or 200 kilometers of overwater bridges, there are nearly unlimited instances of places that
467980	473240	exist in Florida that have no equivalent anywhere else in the world, and perhaps more bizarrely,
473240	474800	within Florida.
474800	478000	The only consistency in Florida is inconsistency.
478000	482560	There's a common thread of incongruity, which started to get woven through Florida
482560	488040	decades, even centuries ago, during the very first days of American encroachment into the
488040	489480	peninsula.
489480	494760	For Florida to become the oddest of American enclaves, it needed to appeal to Americans.
494760	499200	And to be appealing, it first needed to be built, which required time and, in the era
499200	501640	before automobiles, rails.
501640	507320	In 1900, Florida was 32nd out of 45 states in population, sandwiched between Colorado
507320	508320	and Washington.
508320	513400	Miami's population hadn't yet reached 2,000, the 5,000, resident city of Tampa's
513400	517880	economic driver was cigars, and Jacksonville, the state's most successful tourist destination
517880	522160	to date, had recently been ravaged by yellow fever outbreaks, crushing its appeal as a
522160	524680	health retreat for the wealthy Northerner.
524680	530000	As a swampy, seminal stronghold so late to join the Union, most Americans simply couldn't
530000	531500	see the allure.
531500	535360	That changed with this man—Henry Flagler.
535360	539840	For much of his life, Flagler worked side-by-side with titan of industry John D. Rockefeller
539840	543920	building one of America's mightiest businesses—standard oil.
544440	548560	Then, in the 1880s, after spending some time in the state, Flagler turned all attention
548560	553200	to Florida and began manufacturing one of America's mightiest attractions.
553200	557540	First for Flagler was the hotel here, the Ponce de Leon, an immediate success that hosted
557540	560400	the likes of Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain.
560400	565360	Then Flagler, fueled by dreams of an American Riviera, pushed into the swampy, disconnected
565360	569120	south, building a bridge across the St. John's River, establishing the growing network as
569120	572800	the Florida East Coast Railway, and extending the line down to Palm Beach where you would
572800	576400	build the world's largest hotel, the Royal Ponce de Leon.
576400	580680	Soon, the rails reached Miami, allowing fruit produce to go north and well-off tourists
580680	583020	to vacation in the sunny south.
583020	589560	In two decades, Flagler had laid the physical groundwork for coastal Florida to take off.
589560	592720	Equally important, he helped reimagine it.
592720	596780	By beating back mangrove forests and building on beach sides, Florida was no longer the
596780	601780	swampy backwoods—it was a spot to retreat from the cold, to relax, to escape the media
601780	605900	tension that came with extreme wealth, and to rub elbows with the other fortunate few
605900	607500	of similar stature.
607500	611660	Flagler's Florida was intentionally not for everyone.
611660	615980	Effectively a string of jewels, his network of railroad hotels were for the elite and
615980	618300	those who worked for the elite.
618300	623060	Conscripted prison laborers toiled in disease-riddled swamps, building the rails at breakneck pace,
623060	626620	while hotel workers had to move inland and contend with the marshlands.
626620	630200	This divide was especially obvious in Palm Beach where the separation between upper and
630200	634520	working classes was part of its fundamental, foundational design.
634520	639280	West Palm Beach wasn't an outgrowth of Palm Beach's success—rather, it was planned
639280	643580	and plotted beforehand as a commercial town on the other side of Lake Worth for hotel
643580	645000	and estate employees.
645000	649120	While captains of industry meandered around Palm Beach's sleepy, forested walkways,
649120	653200	West Palm Beach functioned like a frontier town bustling with shops on Clemente Street
653200	656160	and notoriously ruckus saloons along Banyan.
656160	659840	While places like this didn't fit the budding narrative around Florida, its workforce made
659880	663480	the dream of a warm winter escape possible for the elite, while the island's natural
663480	667360	separation made its existence bearable.
667360	671640	Turn of the century South Florida was tiny, it was segregated along racial and class lines,
671640	676480	its allure was highly fabricated and problems were thinly veiled, but it had an identity,
676480	679200	and more than anything, it was now tempting.
679200	682520	In the 20s, the state roared to life.
682520	687480	Americans saw how the wealthy were making the most of the area, and they wanted in.
687480	691720	All boards in New York extolled the Florida good life, while Florida real estate ads filled
691720	693400	national newspapers.
693400	699560	In 1925, the Miami Daily News ran 500 pages long, in Ohio, newspapers were banned from
699560	705240	running Florida real estate ads, and each day 7,000 new residents showed up to the state.
705240	709560	To keep them pouring in, the state nixed income and inheritance taxes, loosened real estate
709560	713620	regulation, and left alone spectacles like horse and dog racing.
713620	719480	From 1920 to 1925, Florida went from under a million residents to 1.3 million and became
719480	723540	the vacation spot for Midwestern and East Coast Americans.
723540	727600	Connected by rail then road, and with proof of concept in Miami and Palm Beach, the rest
727600	730180	of the US finally got it.
730180	734560	What Florida offered Americans was that it was so different from America.
734560	739160	The craze reached a point that buying Florida real estate sight unseen became a norm, occasionally
739160	742300	leaving new owners with lots sitting under feet of water.
742300	748940	Often, a simple scam was to blame, but so too was the state's location and topography.
748940	755020	Florida's biggest threat to growth has always been, and will always be, water—first in
755020	757660	the form of tropical storms.
757660	761860	What makes Florida so appealing from the world's richest to a Midwestern retiree, the pleasant
761860	767020	water temperatures, still winds, and warm air, is also what makes it so storm-prone.
767020	771180	At the western end of Hurricane Alley, the peninsula couldn't possibly be more thoroughly
771180	773140	in the bull's eye for tropical storms.
773140	778340	It was a hurricane in 1926, then another in 1928 that stopped the Florida land boom in
778340	783660	its tracks, and the 1935 storm of the century that ripped away Henry Flagler's most audacious
783660	788740	Florida undertaking—the overseas railroad that connected Eastern Florida to Key West.
788740	793840	But storms come and go, water recedes, newspapers and boosters act like they didn't happen,
793840	797700	and federally backed insurance allows people to build back so it doesn't look like it
797700	798700	happened.
798700	802980	This is the case in Miami, as it is Los Angeles, Denver, and Houston.
802980	808020	Florida's other interrelated water problem, however, is a constant—and that's the
808020	813460	fact that South Florida, from just south of Orlando to Biscayne and Florida Bay, is functionally
813460	817640	a big, wide, slow-moving river.
817640	821860	Before the national park, and before development along the coast, the Everglades extended across
821860	827820	almost the entirety of Florida below Lake Okeechobee, and this biodiverse sea of grass,
827820	832320	where water drains so slowly to the ocean it seems stagnant, stood directly in the way
832320	835120	of making true on the Florida Dream.
835120	838980	The problem's pretty simple—for Florida to grow, it needed land.
838980	843220	In the early days of Miami and West Palm Beach, canals and ditches to reclaim land were the
843220	848140	responsibility of local governments and land companies, but by 1948, after record drought
848140	853600	then record flooding, Florida needed a bigger budget to reconfigure its statewide river.
853600	858120	With the creation of the $200 million Central and Southern Florida project, the state and
858120	862960	the Army Corps of Engineers took off on a 20-year project that almost entirely reimagined
862960	864680	the Everglades watershed.
864680	870000	Like Flagler's Railway 50 years prior, the undertaking was exceptionally ambitious.
870000	875760	In cost and scope, it was the most audacious reclamation project taken on by the US.
875760	881360	In principle, it was as bold and self-assured as any other Florida land project or real-estate
881360	882360	development.
882360	886320	It simply aimed to drain an entire state.
886320	891520	And from the perspective of anyone looking to move to the state by mid-century, it worked.
891520	896320	With federal dollars, the 3-mile, 5-kilometer-wide Kissimmee River and its floodplain north of
896320	903720	Lake Okeechobee became C-38—a 58-mile, 93-kilometer-long canal that no longer flooded, seemingly on
903720	904720	a whim.
904720	910160	Below the lake, South Florida water planners built the 105-mile, 169-kilometer East Coast
910160	914500	Protective Levee, along with an assortment of water catchment basins and eastbound canals
914500	918760	that whisked water directly to the ocean without flooding the urbanized East Coast.
918760	923520	By the late 60s, the South Florida Water Management District overseeing the project had drained
923520	928840	half the Everglades with the aid of some 1,700 miles or 2,700 kilometers of canals and levees
928840	934160	and 16 pump stations that carefully monitored and jettisoned water away from urban and agricultural
934160	935740	areas.
935740	940100	Just as the vision of Florida as a dreamy destination was carefully cultivated, so too
940100	946220	was the actual land—painstakingly, expensively dried up and handed over to a wave of real-estate
946220	951660	developers who, in turn, transformed it, divvied it up, and sold it to the hordes of post-war
951660	954220	Americans pouring into the state.
954220	959820	The project was just in time—in two decades, from 1940 to 1960, Florida's population
959820	964680	more than doubled, than from 1960 to 1980, it doubled again.
964680	967920	Since 1980 to now, it has doubled for the third time.
967920	972220	With ample barren land, ambitious master-planned communities like Cape Coral and the villages
972220	977080	breaking ground, and new generations of America's wealthiest making their way to Palm Beach,
977080	980520	Florida is now for the escapist and the elite alike.
980520	986280	In a century, Florida as an idea and Florida as a place has been completely redesigned.
986280	990880	While different sections of reclaimed swamp, slender islands, and former farmland came
990880	995920	to serve Americans of varying age and economic standing, all are bound by the same brash,
995920	1000040	brazen disposition of their developers and the complete enchantment of those who fully
1000040	1002540	latched on to the Florida Dream.
1002540	1008360	In many ways, Florida mirrors less the development of the South or the East, but rather the West.
1008360	1012640	Late to statehood, mired by water problems, and lacking the obvious agricultural potential
1012640	1017660	of Eastern and Midwestern states, Florida languished through much of the 19th century—its
1017660	1020240	population lagged along with its economic prospects.
1020280	1024840	But even Florida didn't benefit from the mineral rushes, irrigated agriculture developments,
1024840	1031480	or ranging economies that buoyed Western states, leaving it uniquely undeveloped and empty.
1031480	1034440	Florida was America's last frontier.
1034440	1038640	By the time Henry Flagler first laid eyes on Palm Beach, railroads had stretched coast
1038640	1043040	to coast for decades, settlers had claimed every worthwhile nook of the Rockies, Alaska
1043040	1048000	had long been transformed into American, yet none thought to bother with the miserable,
1048000	1050800	swampy wilds at the country's southeast.
1050800	1055320	It was effectively an ocean, or at best something in between—hardly an area that one could
1055320	1061760	think of as land until individuals so audacious, so unrealistic, so confident in the impossible
1061760	1065000	task of turning nothing into something came along.
1065000	1070440	There were no homesteads to lay claim to, no rivers around which to centralize, no fertile
1070440	1075660	valleys to drop people in—every inch of Florida had to be developed.
1075660	1082180	There were boosters and there were buyers—that is the story of the state.
1082180	1084420	Differentiation is critical to business.
1084420	1087700	When an entrepreneur goes into a pitchroom to find funding, they don't say they're
1087700	1092580	going to make a taxi company or a bookstore or a DVD rental store but better.
1092580	1096700	They say they're going to do something different—they say they're going to make Uber or Amazon
1096700	1098500	or Netflix.
1098500	1101740	Uniqueness is necessary in business.
1101740	1105480	Investors don't take risks on slightly better, and buyers won't leave the comfort of what's
1105480	1109920	known for the same proposition—to take the plunge, they need the promise of at least
1109920	1113800	the potential of a massive leap forward.
1113800	1116020	Florida is a business.
1116020	1119160	More so than every other state, it had to sell itself.
1119160	1124360	With every inch requiring development, land had to be bought, improved, and sold.
1124360	1128480	The weather was a start, but to convince a far-north buyer to leave the comfort of home,
1128480	1132400	and especially to end up on their land rather than their competitors, developers had to
1132400	1134380	do something different.
1134380	1139100	They had to build a themed, age-restricted wonderland, they had to offer a city of waterfront
1139100	1144460	lots, they had to turn their island into an inherently ultra-exclusive hideaway.
1144460	1148620	Weird sells, and weird attracts weird.
1148620	1151220	Compound that and compound that, and you make Florida.
1151220	1156460	It's a celebration of the bizarre, an affront to Mother Nature, an encapsulation of the
1156460	1161260	American experience where supercharged capitalism and an ignorance of the pragmatic can create
1161260	1167480	impossible wonders unknown to anywhere else on earth.
1167480	1170700	As many of you all know, I travel constantly.
1170700	1173940	As I write these very words, I'm sitting in a hotel room in Scotland finishing this
1173940	1177780	video up, but it would have been pretty tough to write and research this while abroad without
1177780	1180820	using NordVPN, which happens to be our sponsor.
1180820	1185060	That's because rather than comply with Europe's new GDPR data protection requirements, a lot
1185060	1189260	of websites have just decided to block out European users entirely.
1189260	1192920	I was running into issues getting access to local Florida news websites to get info
1192920	1197400	about water quality issues in Cape Coral, but then I fired up NordVPN, routed my connection
1197400	1201700	through one of their servers in the US, and just like that, I could get on the sites.
1201700	1205900	This is just one instance of many issues that stem from the increasing nationalization of
1205900	1206900	the internet.
1206900	1209940	Certain streaming content is geolocked to particular countries, which means you get
1209940	1214220	access to a ton more if you use a VPN, and some governments have country-wide surveillance
1214220	1216420	and firewall programs, for example.
1216420	1220900	So, having a trusted VPN that can essentially transport your connection all around the world
1220900	1224080	is a really useful tool for any internet user.
1224080	1226860	Not only that, but the internet is not always a safe place.
1226860	1230260	I've also been connecting to a bunch of public wifi while traveling to save on data
1230260	1233940	roaming fees, but I'd be at real risk of a cybersecurity issue if I didn't route
1233940	1236820	my data through NordVPN's encrypted connection.
1236820	1241820	NordVPN has earned a fantastic reputation as a trusted, simple-to-use VPN over the years
1241820	1244680	and that's why we're choosing to promote them.
