00:00.000 --> 00:02.520
This is not a town.

00:02.520 --> 00:07.380
It may look like a town, it may act like a town, but it is not one.

00:07.380 --> 00:13.120
This is the Villages, a massive, sprawling, privately-owned, privately-operated retirement

00:13.120 --> 00:17.400
community in Florida that easily ranks as the world's largest.

00:17.400 --> 00:21.500
Driving from one corner to another would take some half-hour, and in that time one would

00:21.500 --> 00:28.200
pass the suburban-style homes of over 130,000 people—all of whom, with rare exception,

00:28.200 --> 00:31.060
were born before 1967.

00:31.060 --> 00:35.280
Despite the entirely manufactured nature of the area, the 2020 census revealed that it

00:35.280 --> 00:39.460
was the fastest-growing metro area in the US over the preceding decade, as it somehow

00:39.460 --> 00:43.880
managed to manicure some sort of charm for some sort of person.

00:43.880 --> 00:49.160
The Villages is centered by a town, or call it a grandiose strip mall, known as Lake Sumter

00:49.160 --> 00:50.520
Landing.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.160
Although it sits about as inland as one can get in the Sunshine States, it's themed

00:54.160 --> 00:58.160
after a quaint seaside town, and even has plaques plastered throughout conveying the

00:58.160 --> 01:03.680
history of the buildings—each entirely fictional, written to bolster the collective, Disney-world-esque

01:03.680 --> 01:08.080
suspension of disbelief that starts the second one loses sight of the sprawling parking lot

01:08.080 --> 01:09.080
that surrounds.

01:09.080 --> 01:14.840
But once in the square, fanciful, incongruous buildings house a plethora of chain restaurants—Johnny

01:14.840 --> 01:20.240
Rockets, Starbucks, Panera Bread, Haig & Doss—flanking around the central square where each night,

01:20.240 --> 01:26.880
from five till nine, 365 days a year, some form of live entertainment takes place.

01:26.880 --> 01:31.700
Beyond the bounds of Lake Sumter Landing and its parking lots, 71,000 suburban-style homes

01:31.700 --> 01:37.320
are punctuated by 53 golf courses and over 100 recreation centers boasting pools, pickleball

01:37.320 --> 01:41.520
courts, gyms, and other facilities that host a deluge of daily clubs and activities.

01:41.520 --> 01:45.680
The Bone Builders Exercise Class, the Women's Parkinson's Caregiver Support Group, the

01:45.680 --> 01:49.760
Villages Lightsaber Club, the Long Island Couples Club, the Northwest Ohio Club, the

01:49.800 --> 01:56.000
Cleveland and Northeast Ohio Club, the Texas Social Club, the options stack up and up.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.080
And these state-related clubs paint a fairly consistent picture of the places that villages

02:00.080 --> 02:01.720
residents come from.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.840
Overwhelmingly, these are middle-class Americans from middle America looking to upgrade their

02:05.840 --> 02:10.800
quality of life with warm weather, low cost of living, and a lack of state income tax.

02:10.800 --> 02:15.360
Despite having no restrictions on who can move in aside from an age minimum of 55, the

02:15.360 --> 02:18.400
Villages undoubtedly attracts a particular type of person.

02:18.400 --> 02:23.460
68.8% of its residents voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2020, and according

02:23.460 --> 02:27.040
to the same year's census, 98% of residents are white.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.520
But that's just the villages.

02:29.520 --> 02:34.680
Three and a half hours to the south, Cape Coral perhaps serves as a villages for a younger

02:34.680 --> 02:35.680
generation.

02:35.680 --> 02:40.960
It, too, is predominantly white, predominantly conservative, predominantly Midwestern, but

02:40.960 --> 02:42.840
more mixed in age.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.760
In place of the core superlative status as the world's largest retirement community,

02:46.760 --> 02:51.880
Cape Coral postures as the city with the world's largest system of navigable canals—over

02:51.880 --> 02:58.480
400 miles or 650 kilometers worth, each painstakingly dredged to grant nearly every lot that valuable

02:58.480 --> 03:03.640
waterfront status and, through a zig-zagging path, boat access to the ocean.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.480
But it was not as ingenious a plan as it first may seem.

03:07.480 --> 03:11.440
In fact, little planning at all went into the development of Cape Coral.

03:11.440 --> 03:15.120
The story is more of its developers making an overzealous land purchase than figuring

03:15.120 --> 03:17.280
it out as they went along.

03:17.280 --> 03:20.640
Selling lots to primarily distant buyers, they didn't really need to focus on the

03:20.640 --> 03:21.700
details.

03:21.700 --> 03:27.160
Few services or amenities existed at the start, and still today, these are few and far between.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.220
Certain areas are a full 15-minute drive away from their nearest supermarket.

03:31.220 --> 03:34.640
With few businesses to generate sales tax revenue, the local government's commercial

03:34.640 --> 03:39.800
tax base is abnormally low, and with a predominantly conservative, anti-tax voter base, the city

03:39.800 --> 03:43.760
has often struggled to find the funding for critical infrastructure projects.

03:43.760 --> 03:48.640
Water, both too much and too little of it, has long been the peninsula's most persistent

03:48.640 --> 03:49.700
problem.

03:49.700 --> 03:54.920
In the early days, there was essentially zero plan for how to get freshwater to residents.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.880
Developers just told buyers they could just build a well on their lot to tap into the

03:57.880 --> 04:02.180
groundwater below, but there wasn't enough of it, and there was even less after the development

04:02.180 --> 04:05.440
of the area disrupted the aquifer's natural recharge process.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.020
Eventually, the burgeoning local government recognized the issue and started building

04:09.020 --> 04:14.460
a central supply system, but it too was relying on the same, inadequate underground aquifer,

04:14.460 --> 04:18.260
digging deeper and deeper as the water table dropped further and further.

04:18.260 --> 04:22.460
Eventually, the city invested in a reverse osmosis plant to turn increasingly marginal

04:22.460 --> 04:26.780
groundwater potable and a reclamation system to stretch that supply further, but continued

04:26.780 --> 04:30.660
underinvestment has meant that, despite being located in one of the rainiest regions of

04:30.660 --> 04:35.500
America, Cape Coral regularly encounters water shortages that spur legally enforced watering

04:35.500 --> 04:39.620
restrictions and quality issues that have pushed water safe to drink up to one of the

04:39.620 --> 04:44.380
top Google autocomplete suggestions when one types is Cape Coral.

04:44.380 --> 04:47.260
But still, growth prevails.

04:47.260 --> 04:51.580
Where else can you get a sunny, waterfront lot with an ocean access dock for less than

04:51.580 --> 04:54.260
$50,000?

04:54.260 --> 04:58.260
But there's still an entirely different class of transplant beyond the retirees and

04:58.260 --> 05:00.740
the middle-class Midwesterners.

05:00.740 --> 05:06.180
Directly opposite Cape Coral, three hours away on the Atlantic coast, sits Palm Beach.

05:06.180 --> 05:11.640
A natural, 18-mile, 29-kilometer long barrier island physically separated from the mainland,

05:11.640 --> 05:15.020
but connected to it by four short bridges.

05:15.020 --> 05:19.680
The island is centered around the massive, storied Breakers Resort, and narrows and narrows

05:19.680 --> 05:23.340
until it reaches just one mega-mansion in width.

05:23.340 --> 05:33.220
These homes sell for inconceivable amounts—$47 million, $110 million, $46 million, $43 million—but

05:33.220 --> 05:37.560
their owners likely only spend just six months and one day in them to attain coveted Florida

05:37.560 --> 05:41.540
resident status and the lack of state income tax it conveys.

05:41.540 --> 05:46.680
Palm Beach, as a phenomenon, essentially exists only between Thanksgiving and Easter, which

05:46.680 --> 05:51.440
referred to as the season when temperatures up north stay cold, hurricanes stay away,

05:51.440 --> 05:56.020
and the nuisance of off-season maintenance stays hidden, but during that period, it truly

05:56.020 --> 05:58.620
is a phenomenon.

05:58.620 --> 06:02.740
Over the winter months, this pencil of an island becomes the global center of gravity

06:02.740 --> 06:05.900
for wealthy, conservative Americans.

06:05.900 --> 06:09.500
While increasingly recognized today thanks to the current full-time residency of former

06:09.500 --> 06:13.820
President Trump at his resort on the island, other central figures of his political party

06:13.820 --> 06:15.680
laid roots long before.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.960
Disgraced former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes lived in his $36 million mansion up until

06:19.960 --> 06:23.920
his death, prominent radio host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh owned a mansion

06:23.920 --> 06:28.980
listed for over $100 million after his death, and failed Republican Senate nominee for Pennsylvania

06:28.980 --> 06:34.380
Dr. Mehmet Oz bought an $18 million, 10-bedroom, 14-bathroom beachfront mansion on the island

06:34.380 --> 06:36.180
in 2018.

06:36.180 --> 06:41.160
All controversial figures, they each undoubtedly appreciate the privacy and exclusivity that

06:41.160 --> 06:44.940
have become known as Palm Beach's core competencies.

06:44.940 --> 06:47.220
Little is public on the island.

06:47.220 --> 06:51.820
Saved for a small, rather unremarkable downtown, the Palm Beach experience is defined by visits

06:51.820 --> 06:55.620
within the walls of neighboring megamansions, or nights at the Everglades Club, the Palm

06:55.620 --> 07:00.400
Beach Bath and Tennis Club, Mar-a-Lago, or any one of the other extremely expensive,

07:00.400 --> 07:02.880
extremely exclusive social clubs on the island.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.960
For those without the means, there's truly little to do so they merely come for work,

07:06.960 --> 07:09.700
then commute back over the bridge to West Palm Beach.

07:09.700 --> 07:13.760
This maintains the social bubble around the island and its residents, shielding them from

07:13.760 --> 07:16.640
real-world quarrels stemming from their reputation.

07:16.640 --> 07:23.400
It's a strange spot, an informal, yet remarkably consistent aberration, and it's in a state

07:23.400 --> 07:26.840
full of remarkably consistent aberrations.

07:26.840 --> 07:32.600
Somehow, this massive peninsula has bred a landscape of truly bizarre, individually unique

07:32.600 --> 07:33.600
places.

07:33.600 --> 07:37.760
Beyond the villages, Cape Coral, and Palm Beach, there's an entire city-sized economy

07:37.760 --> 07:43.000
undergirded by theme parks, there's a linear, inter-island community connected by 125 miles

07:43.040 --> 07:47.980
or 200 kilometers of overwater bridges, there are nearly unlimited instances of places that

07:47.980 --> 07:53.240
exist in Florida that have no equivalent anywhere else in the world, and perhaps more bizarrely,

07:53.240 --> 07:54.800
within Florida.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.000
The only consistency in Florida is inconsistency.

07:58.000 --> 08:02.560
There's a common thread of incongruity, which started to get woven through Florida

08:02.560 --> 08:08.040
decades, even centuries ago, during the very first days of American encroachment into the

08:08.040 --> 08:09.480
peninsula.

08:09.480 --> 08:14.760
For Florida to become the oddest of American enclaves, it needed to appeal to Americans.

08:14.760 --> 08:19.200
And to be appealing, it first needed to be built, which required time and, in the era

08:19.200 --> 08:21.640
before automobiles, rails.

08:21.640 --> 08:27.320
In 1900, Florida was 32nd out of 45 states in population, sandwiched between Colorado

08:27.320 --> 08:28.320
and Washington.

08:28.320 --> 08:33.400
Miami's population hadn't yet reached 2,000, the 5,000, resident city of Tampa's

08:33.400 --> 08:37.880
economic driver was cigars, and Jacksonville, the state's most successful tourist destination

08:37.880 --> 08:42.160
to date, had recently been ravaged by yellow fever outbreaks, crushing its appeal as a

08:42.160 --> 08:44.680
health retreat for the wealthy Northerner.

08:44.680 --> 08:50.000
As a swampy, seminal stronghold so late to join the Union, most Americans simply couldn't

08:50.000 --> 08:51.500
see the allure.

08:51.500 --> 08:55.360
That changed with this man—Henry Flagler.

08:55.360 --> 08:59.840
For much of his life, Flagler worked side-by-side with titan of industry John D. Rockefeller

08:59.840 --> 09:03.920
building one of America's mightiest businesses—standard oil.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.560
Then, in the 1880s, after spending some time in the state, Flagler turned all attention

09:08.560 --> 09:13.200
to Florida and began manufacturing one of America's mightiest attractions.

09:13.200 --> 09:17.540
First for Flagler was the hotel here, the Ponce de Leon, an immediate success that hosted

09:17.540 --> 09:20.400
the likes of Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain.

09:20.400 --> 09:25.360
Then Flagler, fueled by dreams of an American Riviera, pushed into the swampy, disconnected

09:25.360 --> 09:29.120
south, building a bridge across the St. John's River, establishing the growing network as

09:29.120 --> 09:32.800
the Florida East Coast Railway, and extending the line down to Palm Beach where you would

09:32.800 --> 09:36.400
build the world's largest hotel, the Royal Ponce de Leon.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.680
Soon, the rails reached Miami, allowing fruit produce to go north and well-off tourists

09:40.680 --> 09:43.020
to vacation in the sunny south.

09:43.020 --> 09:49.560
In two decades, Flagler had laid the physical groundwork for coastal Florida to take off.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.720
Equally important, he helped reimagine it.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.780
By beating back mangrove forests and building on beach sides, Florida was no longer the

09:56.780 --> 10:01.780
swampy backwoods—it was a spot to retreat from the cold, to relax, to escape the media

10:01.780 --> 10:05.900
tension that came with extreme wealth, and to rub elbows with the other fortunate few

10:05.900 --> 10:07.500
of similar stature.

10:07.500 --> 10:11.660
Flagler's Florida was intentionally not for everyone.

10:11.660 --> 10:15.980
Effectively a string of jewels, his network of railroad hotels were for the elite and

10:15.980 --> 10:18.300
those who worked for the elite.

10:18.300 --> 10:23.060
Conscripted prison laborers toiled in disease-riddled swamps, building the rails at breakneck pace,

10:23.060 --> 10:26.620
while hotel workers had to move inland and contend with the marshlands.

10:26.620 --> 10:30.200
This divide was especially obvious in Palm Beach where the separation between upper and

10:30.200 --> 10:34.520
working classes was part of its fundamental, foundational design.

10:34.520 --> 10:39.280
West Palm Beach wasn't an outgrowth of Palm Beach's success—rather, it was planned

10:39.280 --> 10:43.580
and plotted beforehand as a commercial town on the other side of Lake Worth for hotel

10:43.580 --> 10:45.000
and estate employees.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.120
While captains of industry meandered around Palm Beach's sleepy, forested walkways,

10:49.120 --> 10:53.200
West Palm Beach functioned like a frontier town bustling with shops on Clemente Street

10:53.200 --> 10:56.160
and notoriously ruckus saloons along Banyan.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.840
While places like this didn't fit the budding narrative around Florida, its workforce made

10:59.880 --> 11:03.480
the dream of a warm winter escape possible for the elite, while the island's natural

11:03.480 --> 11:07.360
separation made its existence bearable.

11:07.360 --> 11:11.640
Turn of the century South Florida was tiny, it was segregated along racial and class lines,

11:11.640 --> 11:16.480
its allure was highly fabricated and problems were thinly veiled, but it had an identity,

11:16.480 --> 11:19.200
and more than anything, it was now tempting.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.520
In the 20s, the state roared to life.

11:22.520 --> 11:27.480
Americans saw how the wealthy were making the most of the area, and they wanted in.

11:27.480 --> 11:31.720
All boards in New York extolled the Florida good life, while Florida real estate ads filled

11:31.720 --> 11:33.400
national newspapers.

11:33.400 --> 11:39.560
In 1925, the Miami Daily News ran 500 pages long, in Ohio, newspapers were banned from

11:39.560 --> 11:45.240
running Florida real estate ads, and each day 7,000 new residents showed up to the state.

11:45.240 --> 11:49.560
To keep them pouring in, the state nixed income and inheritance taxes, loosened real estate

11:49.560 --> 11:53.620
regulation, and left alone spectacles like horse and dog racing.

11:53.620 --> 11:59.480
From 1920 to 1925, Florida went from under a million residents to 1.3 million and became

11:59.480 --> 12:03.540
the vacation spot for Midwestern and East Coast Americans.

12:03.540 --> 12:07.600
Connected by rail then road, and with proof of concept in Miami and Palm Beach, the rest

12:07.600 --> 12:10.180
of the US finally got it.

12:10.180 --> 12:14.560
What Florida offered Americans was that it was so different from America.

12:14.560 --> 12:19.160
The craze reached a point that buying Florida real estate sight unseen became a norm, occasionally

12:19.160 --> 12:22.300
leaving new owners with lots sitting under feet of water.

12:22.300 --> 12:28.940
Often, a simple scam was to blame, but so too was the state's location and topography.

12:28.940 --> 12:35.020
Florida's biggest threat to growth has always been, and will always be, water—first in

12:35.020 --> 12:37.660
the form of tropical storms.

12:37.660 --> 12:41.860
What makes Florida so appealing from the world's richest to a Midwestern retiree, the pleasant

12:41.860 --> 12:47.020
water temperatures, still winds, and warm air, is also what makes it so storm-prone.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.180
At the western end of Hurricane Alley, the peninsula couldn't possibly be more thoroughly

12:51.180 --> 12:53.140
in the bull's eye for tropical storms.

12:53.140 --> 12:58.340
It was a hurricane in 1926, then another in 1928 that stopped the Florida land boom in

12:58.340 --> 13:03.660
its tracks, and the 1935 storm of the century that ripped away Henry Flagler's most audacious

13:03.660 --> 13:08.740
Florida undertaking—the overseas railroad that connected Eastern Florida to Key West.

13:08.740 --> 13:13.840
But storms come and go, water recedes, newspapers and boosters act like they didn't happen,

13:13.840 --> 13:17.700
and federally backed insurance allows people to build back so it doesn't look like it

13:17.700 --> 13:18.700
happened.

13:18.700 --> 13:22.980
This is the case in Miami, as it is Los Angeles, Denver, and Houston.

13:22.980 --> 13:28.020
Florida's other interrelated water problem, however, is a constant—and that's the

13:28.020 --> 13:33.460
fact that South Florida, from just south of Orlando to Biscayne and Florida Bay, is functionally

13:33.460 --> 13:37.640
a big, wide, slow-moving river.

13:37.640 --> 13:41.860
Before the national park, and before development along the coast, the Everglades extended across

13:41.860 --> 13:47.820
almost the entirety of Florida below Lake Okeechobee, and this biodiverse sea of grass,

13:47.820 --> 13:52.320
where water drains so slowly to the ocean it seems stagnant, stood directly in the way

13:52.320 --> 13:55.120
of making true on the Florida Dream.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.980
The problem's pretty simple—for Florida to grow, it needed land.

13:58.980 --> 14:03.220
In the early days of Miami and West Palm Beach, canals and ditches to reclaim land were the

14:03.220 --> 14:08.140
responsibility of local governments and land companies, but by 1948, after record drought

14:08.140 --> 14:13.600
then record flooding, Florida needed a bigger budget to reconfigure its statewide river.

14:13.600 --> 14:18.120
With the creation of the $200 million Central and Southern Florida project, the state and

14:18.120 --> 14:22.960
the Army Corps of Engineers took off on a 20-year project that almost entirely reimagined

14:22.960 --> 14:24.680
the Everglades watershed.

14:24.680 --> 14:30.000
Like Flagler's Railway 50 years prior, the undertaking was exceptionally ambitious.

14:30.000 --> 14:35.760
In cost and scope, it was the most audacious reclamation project taken on by the US.

14:35.760 --> 14:41.360
In principle, it was as bold and self-assured as any other Florida land project or real-estate

14:41.360 --> 14:42.360
development.

14:42.360 --> 14:46.320
It simply aimed to drain an entire state.

14:46.320 --> 14:51.520
And from the perspective of anyone looking to move to the state by mid-century, it worked.

14:51.520 --> 14:56.320
With federal dollars, the 3-mile, 5-kilometer-wide Kissimmee River and its floodplain north of

14:56.320 --> 15:03.720
Lake Okeechobee became C-38—a 58-mile, 93-kilometer-long canal that no longer flooded, seemingly on

15:03.720 --> 15:04.720
a whim.

15:04.720 --> 15:10.160
Below the lake, South Florida water planners built the 105-mile, 169-kilometer East Coast

15:10.160 --> 15:14.500
Protective Levee, along with an assortment of water catchment basins and eastbound canals

15:14.500 --> 15:18.760
that whisked water directly to the ocean without flooding the urbanized East Coast.

15:18.760 --> 15:23.520
By the late 60s, the South Florida Water Management District overseeing the project had drained

15:23.520 --> 15:28.840
half the Everglades with the aid of some 1,700 miles or 2,700 kilometers of canals and levees

15:28.840 --> 15:34.160
and 16 pump stations that carefully monitored and jettisoned water away from urban and agricultural

15:34.160 --> 15:35.740
areas.

15:35.740 --> 15:40.100
Just as the vision of Florida as a dreamy destination was carefully cultivated, so too

15:40.100 --> 15:46.220
was the actual land—painstakingly, expensively dried up and handed over to a wave of real-estate

15:46.220 --> 15:51.660
developers who, in turn, transformed it, divvied it up, and sold it to the hordes of post-war

15:51.660 --> 15:54.220
Americans pouring into the state.

15:54.220 --> 15:59.820
The project was just in time—in two decades, from 1940 to 1960, Florida's population

15:59.820 --> 16:04.680
more than doubled, than from 1960 to 1980, it doubled again.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.920
Since 1980 to now, it has doubled for the third time.

16:07.920 --> 16:12.220
With ample barren land, ambitious master-planned communities like Cape Coral and the villages

16:12.220 --> 16:17.080
breaking ground, and new generations of America's wealthiest making their way to Palm Beach,

16:17.080 --> 16:20.520
Florida is now for the escapist and the elite alike.

16:20.520 --> 16:26.280
In a century, Florida as an idea and Florida as a place has been completely redesigned.

16:26.280 --> 16:30.880
While different sections of reclaimed swamp, slender islands, and former farmland came

16:30.880 --> 16:35.920
to serve Americans of varying age and economic standing, all are bound by the same brash,

16:35.920 --> 16:40.040
brazen disposition of their developers and the complete enchantment of those who fully

16:40.040 --> 16:42.540
latched on to the Florida Dream.

16:42.540 --> 16:48.360
In many ways, Florida mirrors less the development of the South or the East, but rather the West.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.640
Late to statehood, mired by water problems, and lacking the obvious agricultural potential

16:52.640 --> 16:57.660
of Eastern and Midwestern states, Florida languished through much of the 19th century—its

16:57.660 --> 17:00.240
population lagged along with its economic prospects.

17:00.280 --> 17:04.840
But even Florida didn't benefit from the mineral rushes, irrigated agriculture developments,

17:04.840 --> 17:11.480
or ranging economies that buoyed Western states, leaving it uniquely undeveloped and empty.

17:11.480 --> 17:14.440
Florida was America's last frontier.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.640
By the time Henry Flagler first laid eyes on Palm Beach, railroads had stretched coast

17:18.640 --> 17:23.040
to coast for decades, settlers had claimed every worthwhile nook of the Rockies, Alaska

17:23.040 --> 17:28.000
had long been transformed into American, yet none thought to bother with the miserable,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.800
swampy wilds at the country's southeast.

17:30.800 --> 17:35.320
It was effectively an ocean, or at best something in between—hardly an area that one could

17:35.320 --> 17:41.760
think of as land until individuals so audacious, so unrealistic, so confident in the impossible

17:41.760 --> 17:45.000
task of turning nothing into something came along.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.440
There were no homesteads to lay claim to, no rivers around which to centralize, no fertile

17:50.440 --> 17:55.660
valleys to drop people in—every inch of Florida had to be developed.

17:55.660 --> 18:02.180
There were boosters and there were buyers—that is the story of the state.

18:02.180 --> 18:04.420
Differentiation is critical to business.

18:04.420 --> 18:07.700
When an entrepreneur goes into a pitchroom to find funding, they don't say they're

18:07.700 --> 18:12.580
going to make a taxi company or a bookstore or a DVD rental store but better.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.700
They say they're going to do something different—they say they're going to make Uber or Amazon

18:16.700 --> 18:18.500
or Netflix.

18:18.500 --> 18:21.740
Uniqueness is necessary in business.

18:21.740 --> 18:25.480
Investors don't take risks on slightly better, and buyers won't leave the comfort of what's

18:25.480 --> 18:29.920
known for the same proposition—to take the plunge, they need the promise of at least

18:29.920 --> 18:33.800
the potential of a massive leap forward.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.020
Florida is a business.

18:36.020 --> 18:39.160
More so than every other state, it had to sell itself.

18:39.160 --> 18:44.360
With every inch requiring development, land had to be bought, improved, and sold.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.480
The weather was a start, but to convince a far-north buyer to leave the comfort of home,

18:48.480 --> 18:52.400
and especially to end up on their land rather than their competitors, developers had to

18:52.400 --> 18:54.380
do something different.

18:54.380 --> 18:59.100
They had to build a themed, age-restricted wonderland, they had to offer a city of waterfront

18:59.100 --> 19:04.460
lots, they had to turn their island into an inherently ultra-exclusive hideaway.

19:04.460 --> 19:08.620
Weird sells, and weird attracts weird.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.220
Compound that and compound that, and you make Florida.

19:11.220 --> 19:16.460
It's a celebration of the bizarre, an affront to Mother Nature, an encapsulation of the

19:16.460 --> 19:21.260
American experience where supercharged capitalism and an ignorance of the pragmatic can create

19:21.260 --> 19:27.480
impossible wonders unknown to anywhere else on earth.

19:27.480 --> 19:30.700
As many of you all know, I travel constantly.

19:30.700 --> 19:33.940
As I write these very words, I'm sitting in a hotel room in Scotland finishing this

19:33.940 --> 19:37.780
video up, but it would have been pretty tough to write and research this while abroad without

19:37.780 --> 19:40.820
using NordVPN, which happens to be our sponsor.

19:40.820 --> 19:45.060
That's because rather than comply with Europe's new GDPR data protection requirements, a lot

19:45.060 --> 19:49.260
of websites have just decided to block out European users entirely.

19:49.260 --> 19:52.920
I was running into issues getting access to local Florida news websites to get info

19:52.920 --> 19:57.400
about water quality issues in Cape Coral, but then I fired up NordVPN, routed my connection

19:57.400 --> 20:01.700
through one of their servers in the US, and just like that, I could get on the sites.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.900
This is just one instance of many issues that stem from the increasing nationalization of

20:05.900 --> 20:06.900
the internet.

20:06.900 --> 20:09.940
Certain streaming content is geolocked to particular countries, which means you get

20:09.940 --> 20:14.220
access to a ton more if you use a VPN, and some governments have country-wide surveillance

20:14.220 --> 20:16.420
and firewall programs, for example.

20:16.420 --> 20:20.900
So, having a trusted VPN that can essentially transport your connection all around the world

20:20.900 --> 20:24.080
is a really useful tool for any internet user.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.860
Not only that, but the internet is not always a safe place.

20:26.860 --> 20:30.260
I've also been connecting to a bunch of public wifi while traveling to save on data

20:30.260 --> 20:33.940
roaming fees, but I'd be at real risk of a cybersecurity issue if I didn't route

20:33.940 --> 20:36.820
my data through NordVPN's encrypted connection.

20:36.820 --> 20:41.820
NordVPN has earned a fantastic reputation as a trusted, simple-to-use VPN over the years

20:41.820 --> 20:44.680
