1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
This is not a town.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,380
It may look like a town, it may act like a town, but it is not one.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,120
This is the Villages, a massive, sprawling, privately-owned, privately-operated retirement

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,400
community in Florida that easily ranks as the world's largest.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,500
Driving from one corner to another would take some half-hour, and in that time one would

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,200
pass the suburban-style homes of over 130,000 people—all of whom, with rare exception,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,060
were born before 1967.

8
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,280
Despite the entirely manufactured nature of the area, the 2020 census revealed that it

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,460
was the fastest-growing metro area in the US over the preceding decade, as it somehow

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,880
managed to manicure some sort of charm for some sort of person.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,160
The Villages is centered by a town, or call it a grandiose strip mall, known as Lake Sumter

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,520
Landing.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,160
Although it sits about as inland as one can get in the Sunshine States, it's themed

14
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,160
after a quaint seaside town, and even has plaques plastered throughout conveying the

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,680
history of the buildings—each entirely fictional, written to bolster the collective, Disney-world-esque

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,080
suspension of disbelief that starts the second one loses sight of the sprawling parking lot

17
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
that surrounds.

18
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,840
But once in the square, fanciful, incongruous buildings house a plethora of chain restaurants—Johnny

19
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:20,240
Rockets, Starbucks, Panera Bread, Haig & Doss—flanking around the central square where each night,

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,880
from five till nine, 365 days a year, some form of live entertainment takes place.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,700
Beyond the bounds of Lake Sumter Landing and its parking lots, 71,000 suburban-style homes

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,320
are punctuated by 53 golf courses and over 100 recreation centers boasting pools, pickleball

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,520
courts, gyms, and other facilities that host a deluge of daily clubs and activities.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
The Bone Builders Exercise Class, the Women's Parkinson's Caregiver Support Group, the

25
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,760
Villages Lightsaber Club, the Long Island Couples Club, the Northwest Ohio Club, the

26
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,000
Cleveland and Northeast Ohio Club, the Texas Social Club, the options stack up and up.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,080
And these state-related clubs paint a fairly consistent picture of the places that villages

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,720
residents come from.

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,840
Overwhelmingly, these are middle-class Americans from middle America looking to upgrade their

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,800
quality of life with warm weather, low cost of living, and a lack of state income tax.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,360
Despite having no restrictions on who can move in aside from an age minimum of 55, the

32
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
Villages undoubtedly attracts a particular type of person.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,460
68.8% of its residents voted for the Republican presidential candidate in 2020, and according

34
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,040
to the same year's census, 98% of residents are white.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
But that's just the villages.

36
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,680
Three and a half hours to the south, Cape Coral perhaps serves as a villages for a younger

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
generation.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,960
It, too, is predominantly white, predominantly conservative, predominantly Midwestern, but

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,840
more mixed in age.

40
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,760
In place of the core superlative status as the world's largest retirement community,

41
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,880
Cape Coral postures as the city with the world's largest system of navigable canals—over

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:58,480
400 miles or 650 kilometers worth, each painstakingly dredged to grant nearly every lot that valuable

43
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,640
waterfront status and, through a zig-zagging path, boat access to the ocean.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,480
But it was not as ingenious a plan as it first may seem.

45
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,440
In fact, little planning at all went into the development of Cape Coral.

46
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,120
The story is more of its developers making an overzealous land purchase than figuring

47
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
it out as they went along.

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,640
Selling lots to primarily distant buyers, they didn't really need to focus on the

49
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,700
details.

50
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,160
Few services or amenities existed at the start, and still today, these are few and far between.

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,220
Certain areas are a full 15-minute drive away from their nearest supermarket.

52
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,640
With few businesses to generate sales tax revenue, the local government's commercial

53
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,800
tax base is abnormally low, and with a predominantly conservative, anti-tax voter base, the city

54
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,760
has often struggled to find the funding for critical infrastructure projects.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,640
Water, both too much and too little of it, has long been the peninsula's most persistent

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,700
problem.

57
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,920
In the early days, there was essentially zero plan for how to get freshwater to residents.

58
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,880
Developers just told buyers they could just build a well on their lot to tap into the

59
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,180
groundwater below, but there wasn't enough of it, and there was even less after the development

60
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,440
of the area disrupted the aquifer's natural recharge process.

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,020
Eventually, the burgeoning local government recognized the issue and started building

62
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,460
a central supply system, but it too was relying on the same, inadequate underground aquifer,

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,260
digging deeper and deeper as the water table dropped further and further.

64
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,460
Eventually, the city invested in a reverse osmosis plant to turn increasingly marginal

65
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,780
groundwater potable and a reclamation system to stretch that supply further, but continued

66
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,660
underinvestment has meant that, despite being located in one of the rainiest regions of

67
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,500
America, Cape Coral regularly encounters water shortages that spur legally enforced watering

68
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,620
restrictions and quality issues that have pushed water safe to drink up to one of the

69
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,380
top Google autocomplete suggestions when one types is Cape Coral.

70
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,260
But still, growth prevails.

71
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,580
Where else can you get a sunny, waterfront lot with an ocean access dock for less than

72
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,260
$50,000?

73
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:58,260
But there's still an entirely different class of transplant beyond the retirees and

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,740
the middle-class Midwesterners.

75
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,180
Directly opposite Cape Coral, three hours away on the Atlantic coast, sits Palm Beach.

76
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,640
A natural, 18-mile, 29-kilometer long barrier island physically separated from the mainland,

77
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,020
but connected to it by four short bridges.

78
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,680
The island is centered around the massive, storied Breakers Resort, and narrows and narrows

79
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,340
until it reaches just one mega-mansion in width.

80
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:33,220
These homes sell for inconceivable amounts—$47 million, $110 million, $46 million, $43 million—but

81
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,560
their owners likely only spend just six months and one day in them to attain coveted Florida

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,540
resident status and the lack of state income tax it conveys.

83
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,680
Palm Beach, as a phenomenon, essentially exists only between Thanksgiving and Easter, which

84
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,440
referred to as the season when temperatures up north stay cold, hurricanes stay away,

85
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,020
and the nuisance of off-season maintenance stays hidden, but during that period, it truly

86
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,620
is a phenomenon.

87
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,740
Over the winter months, this pencil of an island becomes the global center of gravity

88
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,900
for wealthy, conservative Americans.

89
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,500
While increasingly recognized today thanks to the current full-time residency of former

90
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,820
President Trump at his resort on the island, other central figures of his political party

91
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,680
laid roots long before.

92
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,960
Disgraced former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes lived in his $36 million mansion up until

93
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,920
his death, prominent radio host and political commentator Rush Limbaugh owned a mansion

94
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,980
listed for over $100 million after his death, and failed Republican Senate nominee for Pennsylvania

95
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:34,380
Dr. Mehmet Oz bought an $18 million, 10-bedroom, 14-bathroom beachfront mansion on the island

96
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,180
in 2018.

97
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,160
All controversial figures, they each undoubtedly appreciate the privacy and exclusivity that

98
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,940
have become known as Palm Beach's core competencies.

99
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,220
Little is public on the island.

100
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,820
Saved for a small, rather unremarkable downtown, the Palm Beach experience is defined by visits

101
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,620
within the walls of neighboring megamansions, or nights at the Everglades Club, the Palm

102
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,400
Beach Bath and Tennis Club, Mar-a-Lago, or any one of the other extremely expensive,

103
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,880
extremely exclusive social clubs on the island.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,960
For those without the means, there's truly little to do so they merely come for work,

105
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,700
then commute back over the bridge to West Palm Beach.

106
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,760
This maintains the social bubble around the island and its residents, shielding them from

107
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,640
real-world quarrels stemming from their reputation.

108
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,400
It's a strange spot, an informal, yet remarkably consistent aberration, and it's in a state

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,840
full of remarkably consistent aberrations.

110
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:32,600
Somehow, this massive peninsula has bred a landscape of truly bizarre, individually unique

111
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
places.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,760
Beyond the villages, Cape Coral, and Palm Beach, there's an entire city-sized economy

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,000
undergirded by theme parks, there's a linear, inter-island community connected by 125 miles

114
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,980
or 200 kilometers of overwater bridges, there are nearly unlimited instances of places that

115
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,240
exist in Florida that have no equivalent anywhere else in the world, and perhaps more bizarrely,

116
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,800
within Florida.

117
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
The only consistency in Florida is inconsistency.

118
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,560
There's a common thread of incongruity, which started to get woven through Florida

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,040
decades, even centuries ago, during the very first days of American encroachment into the

120
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
peninsula.

121
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,760
For Florida to become the oddest of American enclaves, it needed to appeal to Americans.

122
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:19,200
And to be appealing, it first needed to be built, which required time and, in the era

123
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,640
before automobiles, rails.

124
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,320
In 1900, Florida was 32nd out of 45 states in population, sandwiched between Colorado

125
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,320
and Washington.

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,400
Miami's population hadn't yet reached 2,000, the 5,000, resident city of Tampa's

127
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,880
economic driver was cigars, and Jacksonville, the state's most successful tourist destination

128
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,160
to date, had recently been ravaged by yellow fever outbreaks, crushing its appeal as a

129
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,680
health retreat for the wealthy Northerner.

130
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,000
As a swampy, seminal stronghold so late to join the Union, most Americans simply couldn't

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,500
see the allure.

132
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,360
That changed with this man—Henry Flagler.

133
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,840
For much of his life, Flagler worked side-by-side with titan of industry John D. Rockefeller

134
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,920
building one of America's mightiest businesses—standard oil.

135
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,560
Then, in the 1880s, after spending some time in the state, Flagler turned all attention

136
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,200
to Florida and began manufacturing one of America's mightiest attractions.

137
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,540
First for Flagler was the hotel here, the Ponce de Leon, an immediate success that hosted

138
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,400
the likes of Theodore Roosevelt and Mark Twain.

139
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,360
Then Flagler, fueled by dreams of an American Riviera, pushed into the swampy, disconnected

140
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,120
south, building a bridge across the St. John's River, establishing the growing network as

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
the Florida East Coast Railway, and extending the line down to Palm Beach where you would

142
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,400
build the world's largest hotel, the Royal Ponce de Leon.

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,680
Soon, the rails reached Miami, allowing fruit produce to go north and well-off tourists

144
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,020
to vacation in the sunny south.

145
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:49,560
In two decades, Flagler had laid the physical groundwork for coastal Florida to take off.

146
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,720
Equally important, he helped reimagine it.

147
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,780
By beating back mangrove forests and building on beach sides, Florida was no longer the

148
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,780
swampy backwoods—it was a spot to retreat from the cold, to relax, to escape the media

149
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,900
tension that came with extreme wealth, and to rub elbows with the other fortunate few

150
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,500
of similar stature.

151
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,660
Flagler's Florida was intentionally not for everyone.

152
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,980
Effectively a string of jewels, his network of railroad hotels were for the elite and

153
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,300
those who worked for the elite.

154
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,060
Conscripted prison laborers toiled in disease-riddled swamps, building the rails at breakneck pace,

155
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,620
while hotel workers had to move inland and contend with the marshlands.

156
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,200
This divide was especially obvious in Palm Beach where the separation between upper and

157
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,520
working classes was part of its fundamental, foundational design.

158
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,280
West Palm Beach wasn't an outgrowth of Palm Beach's success—rather, it was planned

159
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,580
and plotted beforehand as a commercial town on the other side of Lake Worth for hotel

160
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,000
and estate employees.

161
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,120
While captains of industry meandered around Palm Beach's sleepy, forested walkways,

162
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
West Palm Beach functioned like a frontier town bustling with shops on Clemente Street

163
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,160
and notoriously ruckus saloons along Banyan.

164
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,840
While places like this didn't fit the budding narrative around Florida, its workforce made

165
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,480
the dream of a warm winter escape possible for the elite, while the island's natural

166
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,360
separation made its existence bearable.

167
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,640
Turn of the century South Florida was tiny, it was segregated along racial and class lines,

168
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,480
its allure was highly fabricated and problems were thinly veiled, but it had an identity,

169
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,200
and more than anything, it was now tempting.

170
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,520
In the 20s, the state roared to life.

171
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,480
Americans saw how the wealthy were making the most of the area, and they wanted in.

172
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,720
All boards in New York extolled the Florida good life, while Florida real estate ads filled

173
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,400
national newspapers.

174
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,560
In 1925, the Miami Daily News ran 500 pages long, in Ohio, newspapers were banned from

175
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:45,240
running Florida real estate ads, and each day 7,000 new residents showed up to the state.

176
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,560
To keep them pouring in, the state nixed income and inheritance taxes, loosened real estate

177
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,620
regulation, and left alone spectacles like horse and dog racing.

178
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,480
From 1920 to 1925, Florida went from under a million residents to 1.3 million and became

179
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,540
the vacation spot for Midwestern and East Coast Americans.

180
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,600
Connected by rail then road, and with proof of concept in Miami and Palm Beach, the rest

181
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,180
of the US finally got it.

182
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,560
What Florida offered Americans was that it was so different from America.

183
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,160
The craze reached a point that buying Florida real estate sight unseen became a norm, occasionally

184
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,300
leaving new owners with lots sitting under feet of water.

185
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:28,940
Often, a simple scam was to blame, but so too was the state's location and topography.

186
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:35,020
Florida's biggest threat to growth has always been, and will always be, water—first in

187
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,660
the form of tropical storms.

188
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,860
What makes Florida so appealing from the world's richest to a Midwestern retiree, the pleasant

189
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:47,020
water temperatures, still winds, and warm air, is also what makes it so storm-prone.

190
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,180
At the western end of Hurricane Alley, the peninsula couldn't possibly be more thoroughly

191
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,140
in the bull's eye for tropical storms.

192
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:58,340
It was a hurricane in 1926, then another in 1928 that stopped the Florida land boom in

193
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:03,660
its tracks, and the 1935 storm of the century that ripped away Henry Flagler's most audacious

194
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:08,740
Florida undertaking—the overseas railroad that connected Eastern Florida to Key West.

195
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,840
But storms come and go, water recedes, newspapers and boosters act like they didn't happen,

196
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,700
and federally backed insurance allows people to build back so it doesn't look like it

197
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,700
happened.

198
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,980
This is the case in Miami, as it is Los Angeles, Denver, and Houston.

199
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,020
Florida's other interrelated water problem, however, is a constant—and that's the

200
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,460
fact that South Florida, from just south of Orlando to Biscayne and Florida Bay, is functionally

201
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,640
a big, wide, slow-moving river.

202
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,860
Before the national park, and before development along the coast, the Everglades extended across

203
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,820
almost the entirety of Florida below Lake Okeechobee, and this biodiverse sea of grass,

204
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,320
where water drains so slowly to the ocean it seems stagnant, stood directly in the way

205
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,120
of making true on the Florida Dream.

206
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,980
The problem's pretty simple—for Florida to grow, it needed land.

207
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,220
In the early days of Miami and West Palm Beach, canals and ditches to reclaim land were the

208
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:08,140
responsibility of local governments and land companies, but by 1948, after record drought

209
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,600
then record flooding, Florida needed a bigger budget to reconfigure its statewide river.

210
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,120
With the creation of the $200 million Central and Southern Florida project, the state and

211
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,960
the Army Corps of Engineers took off on a 20-year project that almost entirely reimagined

212
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,680
the Everglades watershed.

213
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,000
Like Flagler's Railway 50 years prior, the undertaking was exceptionally ambitious.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,760
In cost and scope, it was the most audacious reclamation project taken on by the US.

215
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,360
In principle, it was as bold and self-assured as any other Florida land project or real-estate

216
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
development.

217
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,320
It simply aimed to drain an entire state.

218
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,520
And from the perspective of anyone looking to move to the state by mid-century, it worked.

219
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,320
With federal dollars, the 3-mile, 5-kilometer-wide Kissimmee River and its floodplain north of

220
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,720
Lake Okeechobee became C-38—a 58-mile, 93-kilometer-long canal that no longer flooded, seemingly on

221
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
a whim.

222
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,160
Below the lake, South Florida water planners built the 105-mile, 169-kilometer East Coast

223
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,500
Protective Levee, along with an assortment of water catchment basins and eastbound canals

224
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,760
that whisked water directly to the ocean without flooding the urbanized East Coast.

225
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,520
By the late 60s, the South Florida Water Management District overseeing the project had drained

226
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,840
half the Everglades with the aid of some 1,700 miles or 2,700 kilometers of canals and levees

227
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,160
and 16 pump stations that carefully monitored and jettisoned water away from urban and agricultural

228
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,740
areas.

229
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,100
Just as the vision of Florida as a dreamy destination was carefully cultivated, so too

230
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:46,220
was the actual land—painstakingly, expensively dried up and handed over to a wave of real-estate

231
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:51,660
developers who, in turn, transformed it, divvied it up, and sold it to the hordes of post-war

232
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,220
Americans pouring into the state.

233
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,820
The project was just in time—in two decades, from 1940 to 1960, Florida's population

234
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,680
more than doubled, than from 1960 to 1980, it doubled again.

235
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,920
Since 1980 to now, it has doubled for the third time.

236
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,220
With ample barren land, ambitious master-planned communities like Cape Coral and the villages

237
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,080
breaking ground, and new generations of America's wealthiest making their way to Palm Beach,

238
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,520
Florida is now for the escapist and the elite alike.

239
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,280
In a century, Florida as an idea and Florida as a place has been completely redesigned.

240
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,880
While different sections of reclaimed swamp, slender islands, and former farmland came

241
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,920
to serve Americans of varying age and economic standing, all are bound by the same brash,

242
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,040
brazen disposition of their developers and the complete enchantment of those who fully

243
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,540
latched on to the Florida Dream.

244
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,360
In many ways, Florida mirrors less the development of the South or the East, but rather the West.

245
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,640
Late to statehood, mired by water problems, and lacking the obvious agricultural potential

246
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,660
of Eastern and Midwestern states, Florida languished through much of the 19th century—its

247
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,240
population lagged along with its economic prospects.

248
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,840
But even Florida didn't benefit from the mineral rushes, irrigated agriculture developments,

249
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:11,480
or ranging economies that buoyed Western states, leaving it uniquely undeveloped and empty.

250
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,440
Florida was America's last frontier.

251
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,640
By the time Henry Flagler first laid eyes on Palm Beach, railroads had stretched coast

252
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,040
to coast for decades, settlers had claimed every worthwhile nook of the Rockies, Alaska

253
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,000
had long been transformed into American, yet none thought to bother with the miserable,

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,800
swampy wilds at the country's southeast.

255
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,320
It was effectively an ocean, or at best something in between—hardly an area that one could

256
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:41,760
think of as land until individuals so audacious, so unrealistic, so confident in the impossible

257
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,000
task of turning nothing into something came along.

258
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,440
There were no homesteads to lay claim to, no rivers around which to centralize, no fertile

259
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,660
valleys to drop people in—every inch of Florida had to be developed.

260
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:02,180
There were boosters and there were buyers—that is the story of the state.

261
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,420
Differentiation is critical to business.

262
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,700
When an entrepreneur goes into a pitchroom to find funding, they don't say they're

263
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,580
going to make a taxi company or a bookstore or a DVD rental store but better.

264
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,700
They say they're going to do something different—they say they're going to make Uber or Amazon

265
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,500
or Netflix.

266
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,740
Uniqueness is necessary in business.

267
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,480
Investors don't take risks on slightly better, and buyers won't leave the comfort of what's

268
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,920
known for the same proposition—to take the plunge, they need the promise of at least

269
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,800
the potential of a massive leap forward.

270
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,020
Florida is a business.

271
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,160
More so than every other state, it had to sell itself.

272
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:44,360
With every inch requiring development, land had to be bought, improved, and sold.

273
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,480
The weather was a start, but to convince a far-north buyer to leave the comfort of home,

274
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,400
and especially to end up on their land rather than their competitors, developers had to

275
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,380
do something different.

276
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,100
They had to build a themed, age-restricted wonderland, they had to offer a city of waterfront

277
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,460
lots, they had to turn their island into an inherently ultra-exclusive hideaway.

278
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,620
Weird sells, and weird attracts weird.

279
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,220
Compound that and compound that, and you make Florida.

280
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,460
It's a celebration of the bizarre, an affront to Mother Nature, an encapsulation of the

281
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,260
American experience where supercharged capitalism and an ignorance of the pragmatic can create

282
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:27,480
impossible wonders unknown to anywhere else on earth.

283
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,700
As many of you all know, I travel constantly.

284
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,940
As I write these very words, I'm sitting in a hotel room in Scotland finishing this

285
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,780
video up, but it would have been pretty tough to write and research this while abroad without

286
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,820
using NordVPN, which happens to be our sponsor.

287
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,060
That's because rather than comply with Europe's new GDPR data protection requirements, a lot

288
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,260
of websites have just decided to block out European users entirely.

289
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,920
I was running into issues getting access to local Florida news websites to get info

290
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,400
about water quality issues in Cape Coral, but then I fired up NordVPN, routed my connection

291
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,700
through one of their servers in the US, and just like that, I could get on the sites.

292
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,900
This is just one instance of many issues that stem from the increasing nationalization of

293
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
the internet.

294
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,940
Certain streaming content is geolocked to particular countries, which means you get

295
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,220
access to a ton more if you use a VPN, and some governments have country-wide surveillance

296
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,420
and firewall programs, for example.

297
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,900
So, having a trusted VPN that can essentially transport your connection all around the world

298
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,080
is a really useful tool for any internet user.

299
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,860
Not only that, but the internet is not always a safe place.

300
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,260
I've also been connecting to a bunch of public wifi while traveling to save on data

301
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,940
roaming fees, but I'd be at real risk of a cybersecurity issue if I didn't route

302
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,820
my data through NordVPN's encrypted connection.

303
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,820
NordVPN has earned a fantastic reputation as a trusted, simple-to-use VPN over the years

304
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,680
