00:00.000 --> 00:06.740
In a matter of three weeks, the Russian aviation industry slid back three decades.

00:06.740 --> 00:11.700
With one rambling justification, and a subsequent brazen invasion, came a cascading series of

00:11.700 --> 00:17.000
implications that brought the golden era of global aviation cooperation to a screeching

00:17.000 --> 00:18.420
halt.

00:18.420 --> 00:23.280
As a 21st century Iron Curtain fell across Eastern Europe, Russian commercial aviation

00:23.280 --> 00:29.820
began reverting to a bygone era—an era marked by tension, by distrust bordering on paranoia,

00:29.820 --> 00:34.540
and by extreme and utter isolation.

00:34.540 --> 00:40.060
Throughout the Soviet era, the nation's aviation industry was defined by stark insularity.

00:40.060 --> 00:45.420
While air traffic controllers and pilots around the world spoke English, those in the USSR

00:45.420 --> 00:46.700
spoke Russian.

00:46.700 --> 00:51.140
While Western countries benefited from innovation born out of competition between private aerospace

00:51.140 --> 00:56.220
companies, technological advances in the USSR fell entirely on the state.

00:56.220 --> 01:01.060
Soviet planes, like the Tupolev 104, equivalent to the de Havilland Comet, and the Tupolev

01:01.060 --> 01:06.060
154, equivalent to the Boeing 707, were the intellectual output of a centrally planned

01:06.060 --> 01:11.580
OKB, or an Experimental Design Bureau, while their construction, maintenance, regulation,

01:11.580 --> 01:16.820
and certification all fell under the purview of the centralized Ministry of Aviation Industry.

01:16.820 --> 01:20.340
While much of the rest of the world's aviation industry coalesced around a sprawling set

01:20.340 --> 01:24.680
of standards, a host of trusted aerospace companies and carriers, and a spattering of

01:24.680 --> 01:30.320
supranational organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Soviet Union,

01:30.320 --> 01:31.960
turned inward.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.120
Domestic flights dominated Soviet commercial aviation—flights from Soviet capitals, regional

01:37.120 --> 01:42.400
hubs, and vacation spots composed much of state-run Aeroflot's routes.

01:42.400 --> 01:47.560
Across the post-Stalin era, Russians travelled increasingly by air for business and pleasure,

01:47.560 --> 01:51.080
but rarely did they leave the confines of the USSR.

01:51.080 --> 01:56.520
Though Aeroflot at its height serviced over 100 countries, only select Soviets—diplomats,

01:56.520 --> 02:01.760
athletes, scientists, and artists—saw the outside world with any regularity.

02:01.760 --> 02:06.200
For the business traveler, international trips hinged on their ability to prove the travel

02:06.200 --> 02:10.320
was absolutely necessary, and the ability to pass extensive background checks.

02:10.320 --> 02:16.120
For the average Moscow resident with a hint of wanderlust, well, there was Sochi, or Odessa,

02:16.120 --> 02:17.520
or Dombe.

02:17.520 --> 02:22.280
Of course, strict rules over what went out also informed what went in.

02:22.280 --> 02:27.060
Inbound international flights, when allowed, were bound to specific, sometimes suspiciously

02:27.060 --> 02:32.020
circuitous routings, incoming visitors were given strict travel itineraries, and closed

02:32.020 --> 02:38.920
airspace was closely monitored—in the case of Korean Airlines Flight 7, to tragic consequences.

02:38.920 --> 02:45.360
Closed airspace built walls in the sky—walls which created a world of separated worlds.

02:45.360 --> 02:50.080
One where cities like Anchorage became international hubs—one where the Soviet aviation industry

02:50.080 --> 02:53.840
and Soviet travelers existed separate from the rest.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.720
One that current events have us poised to return to.

02:58.720 --> 03:03.640
Just hours after Russian missiles began tearing across Ukrainian skies, it became apparent

03:03.640 --> 03:09.220
that it wouldn't only be Ukrainian airspace taking on a new atmosphere of hostility.

03:09.220 --> 03:14.200
The same day the invasion began, the UK Department for Transport banned all civilian Russian

03:14.200 --> 03:16.520
aircraft from its airspace.

03:16.520 --> 03:20.020
Direct aeroflot flights from Moscow to Heathrow would be no more.

03:20.020 --> 03:24.360
If Western powers weren't going to directly intervene, they'd lay sanctions.

03:24.360 --> 03:29.080
And as during the Cold War, Western powers again identified commercial aviation as a

03:29.080 --> 03:32.700
means of inflicting economic pain on the aggressor.

03:32.700 --> 03:37.440
In the following days, the European Union, Canada, then the United States, among others,

03:37.440 --> 03:39.600
banned Russian flights from their airspace.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.520
Russia, for its part, responded in kind, closing its airspace to the 30-plus unfriendly countries

03:45.520 --> 03:48.040
in a tit-for-tat move.

03:48.040 --> 03:53.640
Walls went up, in an era of unprecedented peacetime mobility, slammed shut.

03:53.640 --> 03:58.760
Aeroflot, which just days before had operated international flights as far east as Tokyo

03:58.760 --> 04:03.880
and as far west as Los Angeles, announced on March 5th that its only international service

04:03.880 --> 04:08.120
would be into the capital city of Minsk in allied Belarus.

04:08.160 --> 04:12.720
Russian and American carriers began diverting routes so as to avoid Russian airspace—Russian

04:12.720 --> 04:17.960
airspace that US airlines typically crossed an average of 1,400 times a week.

04:17.960 --> 04:23.540
Flights like Lufthansa's LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo once arched over Siberia, but now

04:23.540 --> 04:26.000
cut south through Central Asia.

04:26.000 --> 04:31.100
In the most indicative example of the rapid backslide into Soviet-era aviation norms,

04:31.100 --> 04:35.160
Thin Air announced it was dusting the cobwebs off the circuitous route from Helsinki to

04:35.160 --> 04:40.080
Tokyo—one last flown in the late 80s—adding more than three hours of flight time, but

04:40.080 --> 04:41.880
avoiding Russia entirely.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.880
When, if ever, these walls go down is anyone's guess.

04:46.880 --> 04:51.080
What is certain, though, is that redirected flight patterns and a return to an almost

04:51.080 --> 04:55.880
exclusively domestic route network marks only the tip of the iceberg as to the long-term

04:55.880 --> 04:59.800
impact of Russia's invasion on Russian aviation.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.600
Beyond the growing divide between Russian and global skies, the country's aviation

05:03.600 --> 05:07.360
industry is also experiencing a new, digital divide.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.800
You see, whether it be a hotel in Zanzibar, a rental car company in Jeju, or a regional

05:11.800 --> 05:17.560
airline in Guatemala, the entire world of travel is all connected by the global distribution

05:17.560 --> 05:19.680
system—the GDS.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.280
At the simplest level, the GDS is a common, connected way to communicate and book inventory

05:24.280 --> 05:26.460
between travel providers.

05:26.460 --> 05:30.480
This and other back-end communication is crucial for airlines in particular since they rely

05:30.480 --> 05:35.600
so heavily on bookings originating from third-party online travel agencies like Google Flights,

05:35.600 --> 05:40.160
Expedia, or Skyscanner, and also on selling tickets that include flights operated by other

05:40.160 --> 05:41.160
airlines.

05:41.160 --> 05:45.360
When a passenger flights Delta from Seattle to Amsterdam, then connects on KLM to Athens,

05:45.360 --> 05:48.320
Delta and KLM's systems need to communicate.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.400
If they didn't, the passenger wouldn't be able to get their KLM boarding pass when

05:51.400 --> 05:54.440
checking in in Seattle, they wouldn't be able to check their bag all the way through

05:54.440 --> 05:59.440
to Athens, they wouldn't be able to get help from KLM if a Delta delay led to a misconnection,

05:59.440 --> 06:04.480
back-end communication is crucial for the cohesive travel experience from airline to

06:04.480 --> 06:05.480
airline.

06:05.480 --> 06:12.520
Now, GDS software is essentially run by three companies—Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport—combined,

06:12.520 --> 06:14.560
they hold the market outright.

06:14.560 --> 06:19.400
Therefore, the announcement that all three GDS providers were suspending Aeroflot's

06:19.400 --> 06:23.160
access was considered a death blow for the airline.

06:23.160 --> 06:27.320
This decision was guided by the fact that Aeroflot is a majority state-owned airline,

06:27.320 --> 06:31.840
and so Aeroflot revenue would go directly to the very entity funding the deadly invasion

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
of Ukraine.

06:32.840 --> 06:38.640
Now, without access to the GDS, Aeroflot flights no longer appear on Google Flights, Expedia,

06:38.640 --> 06:44.600
Skyscanner, or any other online travel agency—to book, one must go directly to Aeroflot's

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
website.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.040
In addition, and perhaps more crucially, Aeroflot flights can no longer be booked as part of

06:50.040 --> 06:52.480
itineraries with other airlines.

06:52.480 --> 06:56.840
While most international airlines have suspended service to Russia, Middle Eastern carriers,

06:57.360 --> 07:01.640
namely Turkish, Qatar, Etihad, and Emirates, have emerged as a crucial air bridge for the

07:01.640 --> 07:06.000
country—one of the few convenient ways in or out, especially when heading to western

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
destinations.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.060
Etihad in particular used to co-chair with Aeroflot, allowing a passenger to book a ticket

07:11.060 --> 07:16.640
from Abu Dhabi to Moscow, then seamlessly connect onwards on Aeroflot to Sochi, for example.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.440
Without GDS, this is no longer possible.

07:19.440 --> 07:23.820
Therefore, there's no easy way to travel from outside of Russia to anywhere beyond

07:23.820 --> 07:29.780
the destinations of those few inbound international flights—essentially anywhere but Moscow.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.860
While privately owned airlines in Russia have yet to be removed from the GDS, all restrictions

07:33.860 --> 07:39.660
combined mean that Russia's relative distance to the world has now dramatically increased.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.660
Traveling from London to Murmansk, for example, used to be thoroughly simple—a three-hour

07:43.660 --> 07:47.780
Aeroflot flight from Heathrow to Moscow, a one-hour connection, then a two-hour flight

07:47.780 --> 07:49.620
north to the Arctic city.

07:49.620 --> 07:54.940
Now, however, the most efficient way of that journey is likely a full ten-hour travel day

07:54.940 --> 07:59.980
on Turkish airlines from London to Istanbul to Moscow, an overnight at an airport hotel,

07:59.980 --> 08:03.900
then a morning flight the next day on Aeroflot to finally arrive in Murmansk.

08:03.900 --> 08:10.020
That's to say, the fastest way to get between two cities a mere 1,600 miles or 2,600 kilometers

08:10.020 --> 08:13.740
apart now takes longer than flying from London to Sydney.

08:13.740 --> 08:18.180
But even for those flights that can operate for those passengers who are able to book,

08:18.180 --> 08:21.700
there's an open question as to whether there's going to be the aircraft to fly

08:21.700 --> 08:22.700
them.

08:22.700 --> 08:27.140
You see, while many might perceive aircraft as a product, as something sold from manufacturer

08:27.140 --> 08:30.580
to airline, increasingly they're a service.

08:30.580 --> 08:36.180
A majority of the world's commercial aircraft fleet is now made up of leased aircraft—those

08:36.180 --> 08:40.900
owned by an outside company, but rented to airlines for a term of a few years.

08:40.900 --> 08:44.340
Rather than getting on a years-long waiting list to spend a huge amount of working capital

08:44.340 --> 08:48.920
on a single aircraft, airlines have come to enjoy the flexibility of shorter-term lease

08:48.920 --> 08:49.920
agreements.

08:49.920 --> 08:53.900
It allows them to grow and shrink their fleets more easily in response to shifts in demand,

08:53.900 --> 08:57.720
and pay for aircraft as revenue comes in rather than before.

08:57.720 --> 09:03.500
Of Russia's 980 passenger aircraft, 777 are leased.

09:03.500 --> 09:10.020
Of those, two-thirds, or 515, are leased from companies based outside of the country.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.540
Nearly all of those foreign companies are now either required to terminate their lease

09:13.540 --> 09:17.900
agreements due to sanctions imposed by their home country, or have chosen to due to a lack

09:17.900 --> 09:21.700
of faith in Russian Airlines' ability to continue paying due to the collapse of the

09:21.700 --> 09:25.100
ruble and the decimation of international route networks.

09:25.100 --> 09:30.260
Now, as aircraft leasing gained prominence in the early 2000s, a number of nations came

09:30.260 --> 09:33.000
together to sign the Cape Town Treaty.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.540
Like ships, for example, aircraft often spend much or most of their service lives outside

09:37.540 --> 09:41.220
of the country in which they're registered, so an Irish leasing company like AirCap, for

09:41.220 --> 09:45.060
example, can't rely on Irish law to give it the right to repossess an aircraft for

09:45.060 --> 09:49.540
non-payment if it was leased to a foreign airline and located outside of Ireland.

09:49.540 --> 09:54.500
Therefore, the Cape Town Convention made aircraft leases, and especially aircraft repossessions,

09:54.500 --> 09:56.740
enforceable by international law.

09:56.740 --> 10:00.760
It meant that AirCap had a legal right to ask the Russian authorities to help it seize

10:00.760 --> 10:03.860
an Aeroflot aircraft for non-payment or lease termination.

10:03.860 --> 10:08.540
That's, of course, because Russia is a signatory of the Cape Town Treaty.

10:08.540 --> 10:13.660
However, in this case, facing the loss of the majority of its civil aviation fleet,

10:13.660 --> 10:16.420
the nation just decided to ignore it.

10:16.420 --> 10:22.040
In fact, not only did they ignore it, but instead, Russia began a state-sanctioned theft

10:22.040 --> 10:25.940
of billions upon billions of dollars worth of aircraft.

10:25.940 --> 10:30.240
You see, the majority of the aircraft owned by major international leasing companies are

10:30.240 --> 10:34.500
registered in either Ireland or Bermuda, mostly due to tax advantages.

10:34.500 --> 10:39.020
Therefore, when those two countries revoked the certificates of airworthiness for aircraft

10:39.020 --> 10:43.740
logged on their registries but leased to Russian airlines, that meant that nearly all of those

10:43.740 --> 10:50.260
515 aircraft were no longer legally able to fly and that the lessors wanted them back.

10:50.260 --> 10:55.700
However, in response, Putin signed a law allowing Russia's airlines to re-register these aircraft

10:55.700 --> 10:58.900
as Russian, as if they were their own property.

10:58.900 --> 11:02.860
Essentially, Russia is telling its airlines to just keep the planes.

11:02.860 --> 11:06.020
As long as they don't leave the country, they'll stay in their hands.

11:06.020 --> 11:10.000
That means going forward, these aircraft will likely only operate domestic routes, while

11:10.000 --> 11:14.460
fully owned or Russian leased aircraft will operate any international routes.

11:14.460 --> 11:17.360
However, even that could become difficult.

11:17.360 --> 11:22.000
To retain their legal and practical ability to fly, aircraft are continuously subjugated

11:22.000 --> 11:24.940
to an extensive maintenance and inspection schedule.

11:24.940 --> 11:30.180
But now, both Boeing and Airbus have suspended all maintenance support to Russian airlines,

11:30.180 --> 11:33.900
leaving them few options for sourcing legitimate parts.

11:33.900 --> 11:37.620
Without legitimate parts, even legitimately owned aircraft could lose the right to fly

11:37.620 --> 11:39.060
internationally.

11:39.060 --> 11:44.020
And then on top of that, even the Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet, the most common domestic-made

11:44.020 --> 11:48.780
aircraft, faces maintenance issues too as its official part supplier is Lufthansa Technik,

11:48.780 --> 11:52.620
which is based in Germany—a country that has enacted sanctions preventing the company

11:52.620 --> 11:55.220
from supplying parts to Russian airlines.

11:55.260 --> 12:01.220
Now, there is precedent for this situation—Iran's aviation industry operated under similarly

12:01.220 --> 12:05.260
severe sanctions from 2007 to 2015.

12:05.260 --> 12:09.540
This resulted in them holding onto the aircraft they had prior to the sanctions long past

12:09.540 --> 12:10.900
their typical service lives.

12:10.900 --> 12:15.580
When an aircraft part went faulty, focus was placed on repairing it, rather than replacing

12:15.580 --> 12:20.660
it, since nearly all parts replacement required cannibalizing from grounded aircraft.

12:20.660 --> 12:25.100
As time went on, more and more aircraft had to be grounded to supply parts to the flying

12:25.100 --> 12:29.080
airlines, and the country's skies became some of the most dangerous in the world as

12:29.080 --> 12:32.420
safety standards grew increasingly relaxed.

12:32.420 --> 12:36.420
Russia is likely to operate under a similar system—assuming it continues to hold onto

12:36.420 --> 12:41.780
all 980 of its commercial aircraft, it'll have an oversupply due to its airlines'

12:41.780 --> 12:45.100
inability to operate most in-demand international routes.

12:45.100 --> 12:49.180
But, the longer the sanctions stretch on, the more planes will have to be dedicated

12:49.180 --> 12:54.100
to cannibalization, and the fewer there will be that can actually fly.

12:54.100 --> 12:57.940
Beyond the obvious—the absolute destruction of the progress Russian airlines have made

12:57.940 --> 13:02.340
over the past three decades building themselves up into legitimate, safe, respected global

13:02.340 --> 13:07.260
carriers—the near-total disconnection between the Russian and global aviation industries

13:07.260 --> 13:11.020
could actually accelerate progress for certain others.

13:11.020 --> 13:16.220
To start, between Sukhoi and Irkut, Russia has been attempting to revitalize its storied

13:16.220 --> 13:20.700
aircraft manufacturing industry—so far with little success as their aircraft have not

13:20.700 --> 13:23.460
been competitive with those of Western manufacturers.

13:23.500 --> 13:28.500
However, without the competition, these domestic manufacturers will become one of the only

13:28.500 --> 13:30.640
sources for new aircraft.

13:30.640 --> 13:35.060
This could also have a spillover effect for China as their state-owned aircraft manufacturer

13:35.060 --> 13:40.700
COMAC is nearing first deliveries of its C919 aircraft—roughly equivalent to an A320

13:40.700 --> 13:41.700
or 737.

13:41.700 --> 13:45.140
If it's able to make a version free of parts from countries that have sanctioned Russia

13:45.140 --> 13:49.840
or China, which is a big if, COMAC could capture demand from Russia that could not be fulfilled

13:49.840 --> 13:53.380
by COMAC's primary competitors—Boeing and Airbus.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.940
But the implications go further than that.

13:55.940 --> 13:59.740
While the impact of Russia's airspace closure was dulled by weak international travel demand

13:59.740 --> 14:04.660
to and from Asia, with most of the continent's borders still closed in response to the pandemic,

14:04.660 --> 14:09.900
as this demand grows in step with COVID's fade, this could have broad, long-term implications

14:09.900 --> 14:12.580
on the global aviation industry.

14:12.580 --> 14:16.500
Thin Air, based in Helsinki, for example, has long taken advantage of their position

14:16.500 --> 14:20.560
in the northeast of Europe, on the direct path between most major European and Asian

14:20.560 --> 14:25.320
cities, to offer some of the quickest connecting itineraries between the two continents.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.960
In fact, prior to the pandemic, they were the only major European airline which flew

14:29.960 --> 14:34.800
the majority of their long-haul routes to Asia, rather than North America or elsewhere.

14:34.800 --> 14:39.440
However, when Asian travel demand's return started to lag behind the rest of the world's,

14:39.440 --> 14:43.240
Thin Air announced that it would begin flying long-haul routes to destinations in the US

14:43.240 --> 14:49.580
and Thailand from Stockholm—a new, secondary hub to complement its primary one in Helsinki.

14:49.580 --> 14:53.560
In retrospect, that seems an extremely prudent move, and it's likely the airline will

14:53.560 --> 14:58.560
continue on a similar strategic path—reallocating its resources westward in response to its

14:58.560 --> 15:02.100
quick-flip from best-to-worst position for Europe-to-Asia flying.

15:02.100 --> 15:06.740
But as one airport falls, another rises.

15:06.740 --> 15:10.980
Elsewhere in the northern latitudes, Anchorage Airport might regain its strategic status

15:10.980 --> 15:13.740
for Europe-to-Asia flying.

15:13.740 --> 15:17.540
During the Cold War, Anchorage was home to one of the most cosmopolitan airports in the

15:17.540 --> 15:24.020
world as European and Asian airlines used it as refueling stop—avoiding Soviet airspace.

15:24.020 --> 15:28.260
Routing a flight from Tokyo to London via Anchorage does add about four hours to flight

15:28.260 --> 15:33.200
time, but it is essentially the fastest route when overflying Russia isn't an option.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.340
In fact, Japan Airlines flights on that route have already started flying over Anchorage,

15:37.340 --> 15:42.140
although without stopping for fuel since aircraft now have longer ranges than in decades past.

15:42.140 --> 15:46.640
However, the more fuel you add to an aircraft, the heavier it is, and therefore the more

15:46.640 --> 15:49.640
fuel you have to use to carry the added fuel weight.

15:49.640 --> 15:55.200
Essentially, as flight distance increases, average fuel burn per mile increases.

15:55.200 --> 16:00.840
Of course, packages, unlike passengers, don't care about stops, so cargo airlines have long

16:00.840 --> 16:05.120
used Anchorage as a refueling hub on flights between North America and Asia.

16:05.120 --> 16:09.440
Now, however, it's become advantageous to use Anchorage as a stop on their flights between

16:09.440 --> 16:11.640
Asia and Europe as well.

16:11.640 --> 16:16.160
When upon cargo airlines' route from Tokyo to Amsterdam used to fly non-stop in a quick

16:16.160 --> 16:21.760
11.5 hours, the closure of Russian airspace has now made that entirely infeasible.

16:21.760 --> 16:27.260
Instead, it flies northeast for 6.5 hours towards Anchorage, stops for refueling, then

16:27.260 --> 16:30.160
continues nine hours onward to Amsterdam.

16:30.160 --> 16:34.420
Compared to before, this requires four hours of additional flight time, but it's certainly

16:34.420 --> 16:36.360
better than the alternative.

16:36.360 --> 16:40.760
FedEx is route from Osaka to Paris, for example, normally flying a similar distance between

16:40.760 --> 16:48.560
similarly located cities, now flies 11.5 hours first to Dubai, then 7.5 to Paris—19

16:48.560 --> 16:52.280
hours of flying for a route that previously took less than 12.

16:52.280 --> 16:57.080
If these airspace closures prolong, the airline might opt to route the flight through Anchorage—an

16:57.080 --> 17:00.500
itinerary that could save them two hours over Dubai.

17:00.500 --> 17:05.260
FedEx and UPS already have major operations at Anchorage, so it's very possible they'll

17:05.260 --> 17:08.660
start to expand the model that's worked for Asia to North America flying to Europe

17:08.660 --> 17:11.700
as well in this new reality.

17:11.700 --> 17:15.280
Passenger airlines, however, are likely to take advantage of modern aircraft's incredible

17:15.280 --> 17:20.540
range to continue to run flights to Asia non-stop, even if they physically route over Alaska.

17:20.540 --> 17:26.900
However, one start-up airline is likely quietly celebrating the new inaccessibility of Russian

17:26.900 --> 17:28.100
skies.

17:28.100 --> 17:31.440
Northern Pacific Airways has announced its intention to start flights from Anchorage

17:31.440 --> 17:36.300
to both North America and Asia in 2022, with the goal of creating a connecting hub for

17:36.300 --> 17:38.180
Trans-Pacific travel.

17:38.180 --> 17:42.260
Essentially, they want to become the Iceland air of the Pacific.

17:42.260 --> 17:45.720
This start-up does, however, face an uphill battle.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.120
Transatlantic fares are some of the highest priced long-haul flights out there on a per-mile

17:49.120 --> 17:53.840
basis despite strong competition—the market can sustain it since it's connecting one

17:53.840 --> 17:56.440
wealthy area to another.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.380
Trans-Pacific fares, meanwhile, are some of the least expensive on a per-mile basis thanks

18:00.380 --> 18:04.620
to fierce competition from Asian airlines that enjoy low operating costs and strong

18:04.620 --> 18:05.940
state support.

18:05.940 --> 18:11.140
Therefore, Northern Pacific Airways is unlikely to be able to offer as strong a cost advantage

18:11.140 --> 18:13.660
relative to the market as Iceland air.

18:13.660 --> 18:18.100
However, especially for itineraries from the eastern half of North America or to the western

18:18.100 --> 18:22.860
parts of Asia, Anchorage has gone from a detour to directly on the route.

18:22.860 --> 18:27.380
Delta's flight from Detroit to Seoul, for example, used to take a 13-hour path over

18:27.380 --> 18:32.200
flying Russia, but is now having to route via a more southern 14-hour path over flying

18:32.200 --> 18:33.200
Anchorage.

18:33.200 --> 18:38.120
A passenger originating in Boston flying via Detroit to Seoul on this flight now has a

18:38.120 --> 18:41.040
roughly 19-hour itinerary.

18:41.040 --> 18:45.300
Northern Pacific, with eight hours from Boston to Anchorage, an hour for a connection, then

18:45.300 --> 18:51.040
nine hours onward to Seoul, will now be able to beat Delta by an hour—and even better,

18:51.040 --> 18:54.980
by operating two medium-length flights rather than one long and one short flight, their

18:54.980 --> 18:59.480
fuel burn per passenger will likely be lower, meaning they might be able to offer lower

18:59.480 --> 19:00.480
fares.

19:00.480 --> 19:05.180
Not only that, but they could now potentially expand their business model to Europe as well.

19:05.180 --> 19:09.680
A flight from Anchorage to London, Amsterdam, or Paris only takes nine hours, so coupled

19:09.680 --> 19:14.160
with a six-and-a-half-hour flight from Tokyo to Anchorage, this 17-and-a-half-hour total

19:14.160 --> 19:18.900
itinerary would only be two hours longer than the new, circuitous non-stops from western

19:18.900 --> 19:22.920
Europe to Asia, and would likely sell at a much lower cost.

19:22.920 --> 19:27.700
In comparison to an itinerary connecting from Paris to London to Tokyo, Northern Pacific's

19:27.700 --> 19:29.500
itinerary would likely be faster.

19:29.520 --> 19:35.240
Now, a European expansion for this as-yet-unlaunched airline is unlikely in the near-term, as their

19:35.240 --> 19:39.920
fleet will initially be composed of 757s that cannot confidently reach the major European

19:39.920 --> 19:45.960
airports, but if this new reality entrenches into the long-term, it's certainly an option.

19:45.960 --> 19:49.680
At the very least, though, this has raised the business model's status from one met

19:49.680 --> 19:54.920
with resounding skepticism among experts to one now considered potentially feasible.

19:55.340 --> 20:00.340
Now, the short of all these compounding implications is that, across the board really, from western

20:00.340 --> 20:06.060
travelers to all strata of Russian society, these changes are going to hurt.

20:06.060 --> 20:09.700
The decisions of a few, and the world's response to those decisions, have ensured

20:09.700 --> 20:14.660
we'll all feel the squeeze of closed airspace and aviation sanctions.

20:14.660 --> 20:21.180
Beyond the economics, though, February 24th, 2022 marks the end of a period of mostly sustained,

20:21.180 --> 20:25.120
mostly stable peace between world powers that allowed for unprecedented efficiency

20:25.120 --> 20:30.600
and standardization in the skies, and unmatched mobility and convenience for the traveler.

20:30.600 --> 20:35.080
The three decades of uniquely open and accessible airways are over.

20:35.080 --> 20:41.640
When, or more accurately if we're to return to such a time, at this point, is anyone's

20:41.640 --> 20:42.640
guess.

20:42.640 --> 20:48.000
If you're anything like me, you typically struggle to decide what to do at dinnertime.

20:48.000 --> 20:52.460
Should I have unhealthy freezer food, expensive take-out, or a time-consuming home-cooked

20:52.460 --> 20:53.460
meal?

20:53.460 --> 20:57.940
Of course, I no longer have to make this decision since, for the past two years, I've used

20:57.940 --> 20:58.940
HelloFresh.

20:58.940 --> 21:03.360
That's because it's simultaneously healthy, affordable, and quick.

21:03.360 --> 21:08.060
Each week, I select the meals I want on their app, then the next, a box arrives on my doorstep

21:08.060 --> 21:11.560
with all the ingredients needed in exactly the right quantities needed.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.740
This cuts out all your shopping time and a lot of your prep time so you get straight

21:14.740 --> 21:15.740
to the fun part—cooking.

21:16.480 --> 21:20.720
For example, I made this delicious buffalo spice chicken in under 30 minutes.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.480
Also, HelloFresh is a more sustainable choice.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.240
Unlike the grocery store, they offset all their emissions, their packaging is made out

21:27.240 --> 21:31.500
of recycled content, and a University of Michigan study found that the pre-portioned ingredients

21:31.500 --> 21:35.120
lower food waste by 25% compared to grocery shopping.

21:35.120 --> 21:39.060
All around, HelloFresh just makes mealtime better, and that's why I've been using

21:39.060 --> 21:41.160
them since long before they sponsored the channel.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.780
I recommend you try them out as well, which you can do with an insanely good deal when

21:44.820 --> 21:49.980
you click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOWFOR16 for up to 16 free

21:49.980 --> 21:52.560
meals and three surprise gifts.
