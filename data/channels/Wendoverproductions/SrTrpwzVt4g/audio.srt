1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
In a matter of three weeks, the Russian aviation industry slid back three decades.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,700
With one rambling justification, and a subsequent brazen invasion, came a cascading series of

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,000
implications that brought the golden era of global aviation cooperation to a screeching

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,420
halt.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,280
As a 21st century Iron Curtain fell across Eastern Europe, Russian commercial aviation

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,820
began reverting to a bygone era—an era marked by tension, by distrust bordering on paranoia,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,540
and by extreme and utter isolation.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,060
Throughout the Soviet era, the nation's aviation industry was defined by stark insularity.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,420
While air traffic controllers and pilots around the world spoke English, those in the USSR

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,700
spoke Russian.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:51,140
While Western countries benefited from innovation born out of competition between private aerospace

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,220
companies, technological advances in the USSR fell entirely on the state.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,060
Soviet planes, like the Tupolev 104, equivalent to the de Havilland Comet, and the Tupolev

14
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:06,060
154, equivalent to the Boeing 707, were the intellectual output of a centrally planned

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,580
OKB, or an Experimental Design Bureau, while their construction, maintenance, regulation,

16
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,820
and certification all fell under the purview of the centralized Ministry of Aviation Industry.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,340
While much of the rest of the world's aviation industry coalesced around a sprawling set

18
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,680
of standards, a host of trusted aerospace companies and carriers, and a spattering of

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,320
supranational organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Soviet Union,

20
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,960
turned inward.

21
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,120
Domestic flights dominated Soviet commercial aviation—flights from Soviet capitals, regional

22
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,400
hubs, and vacation spots composed much of state-run Aeroflot's routes.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,560
Across the post-Stalin era, Russians travelled increasingly by air for business and pleasure,

24
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,080
but rarely did they leave the confines of the USSR.

25
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,520
Though Aeroflot at its height serviced over 100 countries, only select Soviets—diplomats,

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,760
athletes, scientists, and artists—saw the outside world with any regularity.

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,200
For the business traveler, international trips hinged on their ability to prove the travel

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,320
was absolutely necessary, and the ability to pass extensive background checks.

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,120
For the average Moscow resident with a hint of wanderlust, well, there was Sochi, or Odessa,

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,520
or Dombe.

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,280
Of course, strict rules over what went out also informed what went in.

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,060
Inbound international flights, when allowed, were bound to specific, sometimes suspiciously

33
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,020
circuitous routings, incoming visitors were given strict travel itineraries, and closed

34
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,920
airspace was closely monitored—in the case of Korean Airlines Flight 7, to tragic consequences.

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,360
Closed airspace built walls in the sky—walls which created a world of separated worlds.

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,080
One where cities like Anchorage became international hubs—one where the Soviet aviation industry

37
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,840
and Soviet travelers existed separate from the rest.

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,720
One that current events have us poised to return to.

39
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,640
Just hours after Russian missiles began tearing across Ukrainian skies, it became apparent

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,220
that it wouldn't only be Ukrainian airspace taking on a new atmosphere of hostility.

41
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,200
The same day the invasion began, the UK Department for Transport banned all civilian Russian

42
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,520
aircraft from its airspace.

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,020
Direct aeroflot flights from Moscow to Heathrow would be no more.

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,360
If Western powers weren't going to directly intervene, they'd lay sanctions.

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,080
And as during the Cold War, Western powers again identified commercial aviation as a

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,700
means of inflicting economic pain on the aggressor.

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,440
In the following days, the European Union, Canada, then the United States, among others,

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,600
banned Russian flights from their airspace.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,520
Russia, for its part, responded in kind, closing its airspace to the 30-plus unfriendly countries

50
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,040
in a tit-for-tat move.

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,640
Walls went up, in an era of unprecedented peacetime mobility, slammed shut.

52
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,760
Aeroflot, which just days before had operated international flights as far east as Tokyo

53
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,880
and as far west as Los Angeles, announced on March 5th that its only international service

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,120
would be into the capital city of Minsk in allied Belarus.

55
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,720
Russian and American carriers began diverting routes so as to avoid Russian airspace—Russian

56
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,960
airspace that US airlines typically crossed an average of 1,400 times a week.

57
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,540
Flights like Lufthansa's LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo once arched over Siberia, but now

58
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,000
cut south through Central Asia.

59
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,100
In the most indicative example of the rapid backslide into Soviet-era aviation norms,

60
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,160
Thin Air announced it was dusting the cobwebs off the circuitous route from Helsinki to

61
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,080
Tokyo—one last flown in the late 80s—adding more than three hours of flight time, but

62
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,880
avoiding Russia entirely.

63
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,880
When, if ever, these walls go down is anyone's guess.

64
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,080
What is certain, though, is that redirected flight patterns and a return to an almost

65
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,880
exclusively domestic route network marks only the tip of the iceberg as to the long-term

66
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,800
impact of Russia's invasion on Russian aviation.

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Beyond the growing divide between Russian and global skies, the country's aviation

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
industry is also experiencing a new, digital divide.

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,800
You see, whether it be a hotel in Zanzibar, a rental car company in Jeju, or a regional

70
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,560
airline in Guatemala, the entire world of travel is all connected by the global distribution

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,680
system—the GDS.

72
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,280
At the simplest level, the GDS is a common, connected way to communicate and book inventory

73
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,460
between travel providers.

74
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,480
This and other back-end communication is crucial for airlines in particular since they rely

75
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,600
so heavily on bookings originating from third-party online travel agencies like Google Flights,

76
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
Expedia, or Skyscanner, and also on selling tickets that include flights operated by other

77
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
airlines.

78
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,360
When a passenger flights Delta from Seattle to Amsterdam, then connects on KLM to Athens,

79
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,320
Delta and KLM's systems need to communicate.

80
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,400
If they didn't, the passenger wouldn't be able to get their KLM boarding pass when

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,440
checking in in Seattle, they wouldn't be able to check their bag all the way through

82
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,440
to Athens, they wouldn't be able to get help from KLM if a Delta delay led to a misconnection,

83
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,480
back-end communication is crucial for the cohesive travel experience from airline to

84
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
airline.

85
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,520
Now, GDS software is essentially run by three companies—Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport—combined,

86
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,560
they hold the market outright.

87
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Therefore, the announcement that all three GDS providers were suspending Aeroflot's

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,160
access was considered a death blow for the airline.

89
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,320
This decision was guided by the fact that Aeroflot is a majority state-owned airline,

90
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,840
and so Aeroflot revenue would go directly to the very entity funding the deadly invasion

91
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,840
of Ukraine.

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,640
Now, without access to the GDS, Aeroflot flights no longer appear on Google Flights, Expedia,

93
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:44,600
Skyscanner, or any other online travel agency—to book, one must go directly to Aeroflot's

94
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
website.

95
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,040
In addition, and perhaps more crucially, Aeroflot flights can no longer be booked as part of

96
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,480
itineraries with other airlines.

97
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,840
While most international airlines have suspended service to Russia, Middle Eastern carriers,

98
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,640
namely Turkish, Qatar, Etihad, and Emirates, have emerged as a crucial air bridge for the

99
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,000
country—one of the few convenient ways in or out, especially when heading to western

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
destinations.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,060
Etihad in particular used to co-chair with Aeroflot, allowing a passenger to book a ticket

102
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,640
from Abu Dhabi to Moscow, then seamlessly connect onwards on Aeroflot to Sochi, for example.

103
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,440
Without GDS, this is no longer possible.

104
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,820
Therefore, there's no easy way to travel from outside of Russia to anywhere beyond

105
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,780
the destinations of those few inbound international flights—essentially anywhere but Moscow.

106
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,860
While privately owned airlines in Russia have yet to be removed from the GDS, all restrictions

107
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,660
combined mean that Russia's relative distance to the world has now dramatically increased.

108
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,660
Traveling from London to Murmansk, for example, used to be thoroughly simple—a three-hour

109
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,780
Aeroflot flight from Heathrow to Moscow, a one-hour connection, then a two-hour flight

110
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,620
north to the Arctic city.

111
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,940
Now, however, the most efficient way of that journey is likely a full ten-hour travel day

112
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,980
on Turkish airlines from London to Istanbul to Moscow, an overnight at an airport hotel,

113
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,900
then a morning flight the next day on Aeroflot to finally arrive in Murmansk.

114
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:10,020
That's to say, the fastest way to get between two cities a mere 1,600 miles or 2,600 kilometers

115
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,740
apart now takes longer than flying from London to Sydney.

116
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,180
But even for those flights that can operate for those passengers who are able to book,

117
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,700
there's an open question as to whether there's going to be the aircraft to fly

118
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,700
them.

119
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,140
You see, while many might perceive aircraft as a product, as something sold from manufacturer

120
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,580
to airline, increasingly they're a service.

121
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,180
A majority of the world's commercial aircraft fleet is now made up of leased aircraft—those

122
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,900
owned by an outside company, but rented to airlines for a term of a few years.

123
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,340
Rather than getting on a years-long waiting list to spend a huge amount of working capital

124
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,920
on a single aircraft, airlines have come to enjoy the flexibility of shorter-term lease

125
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
agreements.

126
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,900
It allows them to grow and shrink their fleets more easily in response to shifts in demand,

127
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,720
and pay for aircraft as revenue comes in rather than before.

128
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,500
Of Russia's 980 passenger aircraft, 777 are leased.

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,020
Of those, two-thirds, or 515, are leased from companies based outside of the country.

130
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,540
Nearly all of those foreign companies are now either required to terminate their lease

131
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,900
agreements due to sanctions imposed by their home country, or have chosen to due to a lack

132
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,700
of faith in Russian Airlines' ability to continue paying due to the collapse of the

133
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,100
ruble and the decimation of international route networks.

134
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,260
Now, as aircraft leasing gained prominence in the early 2000s, a number of nations came

135
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,000
together to sign the Cape Town Treaty.

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,540
Like ships, for example, aircraft often spend much or most of their service lives outside

137
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,220
of the country in which they're registered, so an Irish leasing company like AirCap, for

138
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,060
example, can't rely on Irish law to give it the right to repossess an aircraft for

139
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,540
non-payment if it was leased to a foreign airline and located outside of Ireland.

140
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,500
Therefore, the Cape Town Convention made aircraft leases, and especially aircraft repossessions,

141
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,740
enforceable by international law.

142
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,760
It meant that AirCap had a legal right to ask the Russian authorities to help it seize

143
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,860
an Aeroflot aircraft for non-payment or lease termination.

144
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:08,540
That's, of course, because Russia is a signatory of the Cape Town Treaty.

145
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,660
However, in this case, facing the loss of the majority of its civil aviation fleet,

146
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,420
the nation just decided to ignore it.

147
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,040
In fact, not only did they ignore it, but instead, Russia began a state-sanctioned theft

148
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,940
of billions upon billions of dollars worth of aircraft.

149
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,240
You see, the majority of the aircraft owned by major international leasing companies are

150
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,500
registered in either Ireland or Bermuda, mostly due to tax advantages.

151
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,020
Therefore, when those two countries revoked the certificates of airworthiness for aircraft

152
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,740
logged on their registries but leased to Russian airlines, that meant that nearly all of those

153
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,260
515 aircraft were no longer legally able to fly and that the lessors wanted them back.

154
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,700
However, in response, Putin signed a law allowing Russia's airlines to re-register these aircraft

155
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,900
as Russian, as if they were their own property.

156
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,860
Essentially, Russia is telling its airlines to just keep the planes.

157
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,020
As long as they don't leave the country, they'll stay in their hands.

158
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,000
That means going forward, these aircraft will likely only operate domestic routes, while

159
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,460
fully owned or Russian leased aircraft will operate any international routes.

160
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,360
However, even that could become difficult.

161
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,000
To retain their legal and practical ability to fly, aircraft are continuously subjugated

162
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,940
to an extensive maintenance and inspection schedule.

163
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,180
But now, both Boeing and Airbus have suspended all maintenance support to Russian airlines,

164
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,900
leaving them few options for sourcing legitimate parts.

165
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,620
Without legitimate parts, even legitimately owned aircraft could lose the right to fly

166
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,060
internationally.

167
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:44,020
And then on top of that, even the Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet, the most common domestic-made

168
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:48,780
aircraft, faces maintenance issues too as its official part supplier is Lufthansa Technik,

169
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:52,620
which is based in Germany—a country that has enacted sanctions preventing the company

170
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,220
from supplying parts to Russian airlines.

171
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,220
Now, there is precedent for this situation—Iran's aviation industry operated under similarly

172
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,260
severe sanctions from 2007 to 2015.

173
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,540
This resulted in them holding onto the aircraft they had prior to the sanctions long past

174
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,900
their typical service lives.

175
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,580
When an aircraft part went faulty, focus was placed on repairing it, rather than replacing

176
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,660
it, since nearly all parts replacement required cannibalizing from grounded aircraft.

177
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,100
As time went on, more and more aircraft had to be grounded to supply parts to the flying

178
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,080
airlines, and the country's skies became some of the most dangerous in the world as

179
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:32,420
safety standards grew increasingly relaxed.

180
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Russia is likely to operate under a similar system—assuming it continues to hold onto

181
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,780
all 980 of its commercial aircraft, it'll have an oversupply due to its airlines'

182
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,100
inability to operate most in-demand international routes.

183
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,180
But, the longer the sanctions stretch on, the more planes will have to be dedicated

184
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,100
to cannibalization, and the fewer there will be that can actually fly.

185
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,940
Beyond the obvious—the absolute destruction of the progress Russian airlines have made

186
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,340
over the past three decades building themselves up into legitimate, safe, respected global

187
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,260
carriers—the near-total disconnection between the Russian and global aviation industries

188
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,020
could actually accelerate progress for certain others.

189
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,220
To start, between Sukhoi and Irkut, Russia has been attempting to revitalize its storied

190
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,700
aircraft manufacturing industry—so far with little success as their aircraft have not

191
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,460
been competitive with those of Western manufacturers.

192
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,500
However, without the competition, these domestic manufacturers will become one of the only

193
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,640
sources for new aircraft.

194
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,060
This could also have a spillover effect for China as their state-owned aircraft manufacturer

195
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,700
COMAC is nearing first deliveries of its C919 aircraft—roughly equivalent to an A320

196
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,700
or 737.

197
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,140
If it's able to make a version free of parts from countries that have sanctioned Russia

198
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:49,840
or China, which is a big if, COMAC could capture demand from Russia that could not be fulfilled

199
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,380
by COMAC's primary competitors—Boeing and Airbus.

200
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,940
But the implications go further than that.

201
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,740
While the impact of Russia's airspace closure was dulled by weak international travel demand

202
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:04,660
to and from Asia, with most of the continent's borders still closed in response to the pandemic,

203
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,900
as this demand grows in step with COVID's fade, this could have broad, long-term implications

204
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,580
on the global aviation industry.

205
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,500
Thin Air, based in Helsinki, for example, has long taken advantage of their position

206
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,560
in the northeast of Europe, on the direct path between most major European and Asian

207
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,320
cities, to offer some of the quickest connecting itineraries between the two continents.

208
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,960
In fact, prior to the pandemic, they were the only major European airline which flew

209
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,800
the majority of their long-haul routes to Asia, rather than North America or elsewhere.

210
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,440
However, when Asian travel demand's return started to lag behind the rest of the world's,

211
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,240
Thin Air announced that it would begin flying long-haul routes to destinations in the US

212
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,580
and Thailand from Stockholm—a new, secondary hub to complement its primary one in Helsinki.

213
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,560
In retrospect, that seems an extremely prudent move, and it's likely the airline will

214
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,560
continue on a similar strategic path—reallocating its resources westward in response to its

215
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,100
quick-flip from best-to-worst position for Europe-to-Asia flying.

216
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,740
But as one airport falls, another rises.

217
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,980
Elsewhere in the northern latitudes, Anchorage Airport might regain its strategic status

218
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,740
for Europe-to-Asia flying.

219
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,540
During the Cold War, Anchorage was home to one of the most cosmopolitan airports in the

220
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:24,020
world as European and Asian airlines used it as refueling stop—avoiding Soviet airspace.

221
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,260
Routing a flight from Tokyo to London via Anchorage does add about four hours to flight

222
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,200
time, but it is essentially the fastest route when overflying Russia isn't an option.

223
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,340
In fact, Japan Airlines flights on that route have already started flying over Anchorage,

224
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,140
although without stopping for fuel since aircraft now have longer ranges than in decades past.

225
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,640
However, the more fuel you add to an aircraft, the heavier it is, and therefore the more

226
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
fuel you have to use to carry the added fuel weight.

227
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,200
Essentially, as flight distance increases, average fuel burn per mile increases.

228
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,840
Of course, packages, unlike passengers, don't care about stops, so cargo airlines have long

229
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,120
used Anchorage as a refueling hub on flights between North America and Asia.

230
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,440
Now, however, it's become advantageous to use Anchorage as a stop on their flights between

231
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,640
Asia and Europe as well.

232
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,160
When upon cargo airlines' route from Tokyo to Amsterdam used to fly non-stop in a quick

233
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,760
11.5 hours, the closure of Russian airspace has now made that entirely infeasible.

234
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,260
Instead, it flies northeast for 6.5 hours towards Anchorage, stops for refueling, then

235
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,160
continues nine hours onward to Amsterdam.

236
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,420
Compared to before, this requires four hours of additional flight time, but it's certainly

237
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,360
better than the alternative.

238
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,760
FedEx is route from Osaka to Paris, for example, normally flying a similar distance between

239
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:48,560
similarly located cities, now flies 11.5 hours first to Dubai, then 7.5 to Paris—19

240
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,280
hours of flying for a route that previously took less than 12.

241
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,080
If these airspace closures prolong, the airline might opt to route the flight through Anchorage—an

242
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,500
itinerary that could save them two hours over Dubai.

243
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,260
FedEx and UPS already have major operations at Anchorage, so it's very possible they'll

244
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,660
start to expand the model that's worked for Asia to North America flying to Europe

245
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,700
as well in this new reality.

246
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,280
Passenger airlines, however, are likely to take advantage of modern aircraft's incredible

247
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,540
range to continue to run flights to Asia non-stop, even if they physically route over Alaska.

248
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,900
However, one start-up airline is likely quietly celebrating the new inaccessibility of Russian

249
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,100
skies.

250
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,440
Northern Pacific Airways has announced its intention to start flights from Anchorage

251
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,300
to both North America and Asia in 2022, with the goal of creating a connecting hub for

252
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,180
Trans-Pacific travel.

253
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,260
Essentially, they want to become the Iceland air of the Pacific.

254
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,720
This start-up does, however, face an uphill battle.

255
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,120
Transatlantic fares are some of the highest priced long-haul flights out there on a per-mile

256
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,840
basis despite strong competition—the market can sustain it since it's connecting one

257
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,440
wealthy area to another.

258
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,380
Trans-Pacific fares, meanwhile, are some of the least expensive on a per-mile basis thanks

259
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,620
to fierce competition from Asian airlines that enjoy low operating costs and strong

260
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,940
state support.

261
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,140
Therefore, Northern Pacific Airways is unlikely to be able to offer as strong a cost advantage

262
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,660
relative to the market as Iceland air.

263
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,100
However, especially for itineraries from the eastern half of North America or to the western

264
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,860
parts of Asia, Anchorage has gone from a detour to directly on the route.

265
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,380
Delta's flight from Detroit to Seoul, for example, used to take a 13-hour path over

266
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,200
flying Russia, but is now having to route via a more southern 14-hour path over flying

267
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,200
Anchorage.

268
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,120
A passenger originating in Boston flying via Detroit to Seoul on this flight now has a

269
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,040
roughly 19-hour itinerary.

270
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,300
Northern Pacific, with eight hours from Boston to Anchorage, an hour for a connection, then

271
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:51,040
nine hours onward to Seoul, will now be able to beat Delta by an hour—and even better,

272
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,980
by operating two medium-length flights rather than one long and one short flight, their

273
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,480
fuel burn per passenger will likely be lower, meaning they might be able to offer lower

274
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
fares.

275
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,180
Not only that, but they could now potentially expand their business model to Europe as well.

276
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,680
A flight from Anchorage to London, Amsterdam, or Paris only takes nine hours, so coupled

277
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,160
with a six-and-a-half-hour flight from Tokyo to Anchorage, this 17-and-a-half-hour total

278
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,900
itinerary would only be two hours longer than the new, circuitous non-stops from western

279
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,920
Europe to Asia, and would likely sell at a much lower cost.

280
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,700
In comparison to an itinerary connecting from Paris to London to Tokyo, Northern Pacific's

281
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,500
itinerary would likely be faster.

282
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,240
Now, a European expansion for this as-yet-unlaunched airline is unlikely in the near-term, as their

283
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,920
fleet will initially be composed of 757s that cannot confidently reach the major European

284
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,960
airports, but if this new reality entrenches into the long-term, it's certainly an option.

285
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,680
At the very least, though, this has raised the business model's status from one met

286
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,920
with resounding skepticism among experts to one now considered potentially feasible.

287
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Now, the short of all these compounding implications is that, across the board really, from western

288
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:06,060
travelers to all strata of Russian society, these changes are going to hurt.

289
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,700
The decisions of a few, and the world's response to those decisions, have ensured

290
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,660
we'll all feel the squeeze of closed airspace and aviation sanctions.

291
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:21,180
Beyond the economics, though, February 24th, 2022 marks the end of a period of mostly sustained,

292
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,120
mostly stable peace between world powers that allowed for unprecedented efficiency

293
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,600
and standardization in the skies, and unmatched mobility and convenience for the traveler.

294
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,080
The three decades of uniquely open and accessible airways are over.

295
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,640
When, or more accurately if we're to return to such a time, at this point, is anyone's

296
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
guess.

297
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,000
If you're anything like me, you typically struggle to decide what to do at dinnertime.

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,460
Should I have unhealthy freezer food, expensive take-out, or a time-consuming home-cooked

299
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
meal?

300
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,940
Of course, I no longer have to make this decision since, for the past two years, I've used

301
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,940
HelloFresh.

302
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,360
That's because it's simultaneously healthy, affordable, and quick.

303
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,060
Each week, I select the meals I want on their app, then the next, a box arrives on my doorstep

304
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,560
with all the ingredients needed in exactly the right quantities needed.

305
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,740
This cuts out all your shopping time and a lot of your prep time so you get straight

306
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
to the fun part—cooking.

307
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
For example, I made this delicious buffalo spice chicken in under 30 minutes.

308
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,480
Also, HelloFresh is a more sustainable choice.

309
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,240
Unlike the grocery store, they offset all their emissions, their packaging is made out

310
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,500
of recycled content, and a University of Michigan study found that the pre-portioned ingredients

311
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,120
lower food waste by 25% compared to grocery shopping.

312
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,060
All around, HelloFresh just makes mealtime better, and that's why I've been using

313
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,160
them since long before they sponsored the channel.

314
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,780
I recommend you try them out as well, which you can do with an insanely good deal when

315
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,980
you click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOWFOR16 for up to 16 free

316
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,560
meals and three surprise gifts.
