0	6740	In a matter of three weeks, the Russian aviation industry slid back three decades.
6740	11700	With one rambling justification, and a subsequent brazen invasion, came a cascading series of
11700	17000	implications that brought the golden era of global aviation cooperation to a screeching
17000	18420	halt.
18420	23280	As a 21st century Iron Curtain fell across Eastern Europe, Russian commercial aviation
23280	29820	began reverting to a bygone era—an era marked by tension, by distrust bordering on paranoia,
29820	34540	and by extreme and utter isolation.
34540	40060	Throughout the Soviet era, the nation's aviation industry was defined by stark insularity.
40060	45420	While air traffic controllers and pilots around the world spoke English, those in the USSR
45420	46700	spoke Russian.
46700	51140	While Western countries benefited from innovation born out of competition between private aerospace
51140	56220	companies, technological advances in the USSR fell entirely on the state.
56220	61060	Soviet planes, like the Tupolev 104, equivalent to the de Havilland Comet, and the Tupolev
61060	66060	154, equivalent to the Boeing 707, were the intellectual output of a centrally planned
66060	71580	OKB, or an Experimental Design Bureau, while their construction, maintenance, regulation,
71580	76820	and certification all fell under the purview of the centralized Ministry of Aviation Industry.
76820	80340	While much of the rest of the world's aviation industry coalesced around a sprawling set
80340	84680	of standards, a host of trusted aerospace companies and carriers, and a spattering of
84680	90320	supranational organizations like the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Soviet Union,
90320	91960	turned inward.
91960	97120	Domestic flights dominated Soviet commercial aviation—flights from Soviet capitals, regional
97120	102400	hubs, and vacation spots composed much of state-run Aeroflot's routes.
102400	107560	Across the post-Stalin era, Russians travelled increasingly by air for business and pleasure,
107560	111080	but rarely did they leave the confines of the USSR.
111080	116520	Though Aeroflot at its height serviced over 100 countries, only select Soviets—diplomats,
116520	121760	athletes, scientists, and artists—saw the outside world with any regularity.
121760	126200	For the business traveler, international trips hinged on their ability to prove the travel
126200	130320	was absolutely necessary, and the ability to pass extensive background checks.
130320	136120	For the average Moscow resident with a hint of wanderlust, well, there was Sochi, or Odessa,
136120	137520	or Dombe.
137520	142280	Of course, strict rules over what went out also informed what went in.
142280	147060	Inbound international flights, when allowed, were bound to specific, sometimes suspiciously
147060	152020	circuitous routings, incoming visitors were given strict travel itineraries, and closed
152020	158920	airspace was closely monitored—in the case of Korean Airlines Flight 7, to tragic consequences.
158920	165360	Closed airspace built walls in the sky—walls which created a world of separated worlds.
165360	170080	One where cities like Anchorage became international hubs—one where the Soviet aviation industry
170080	173840	and Soviet travelers existed separate from the rest.
173840	178720	One that current events have us poised to return to.
178720	183640	Just hours after Russian missiles began tearing across Ukrainian skies, it became apparent
183640	189220	that it wouldn't only be Ukrainian airspace taking on a new atmosphere of hostility.
189220	194200	The same day the invasion began, the UK Department for Transport banned all civilian Russian
194200	196520	aircraft from its airspace.
196520	200020	Direct aeroflot flights from Moscow to Heathrow would be no more.
200020	204360	If Western powers weren't going to directly intervene, they'd lay sanctions.
204360	209080	And as during the Cold War, Western powers again identified commercial aviation as a
209080	212700	means of inflicting economic pain on the aggressor.
212700	217440	In the following days, the European Union, Canada, then the United States, among others,
217440	219600	banned Russian flights from their airspace.
220000	225520	Russia, for its part, responded in kind, closing its airspace to the 30-plus unfriendly countries
225520	228040	in a tit-for-tat move.
228040	233640	Walls went up, in an era of unprecedented peacetime mobility, slammed shut.
233640	238760	Aeroflot, which just days before had operated international flights as far east as Tokyo
238760	243880	and as far west as Los Angeles, announced on March 5th that its only international service
243880	248120	would be into the capital city of Minsk in allied Belarus.
248160	252720	Russian and American carriers began diverting routes so as to avoid Russian airspace—Russian
252720	257960	airspace that US airlines typically crossed an average of 1,400 times a week.
257960	263540	Flights like Lufthansa's LH716 from Frankfurt to Tokyo once arched over Siberia, but now
263540	266000	cut south through Central Asia.
266000	271100	In the most indicative example of the rapid backslide into Soviet-era aviation norms,
271100	275160	Thin Air announced it was dusting the cobwebs off the circuitous route from Helsinki to
275160	280080	Tokyo—one last flown in the late 80s—adding more than three hours of flight time, but
280080	281880	avoiding Russia entirely.
281880	286880	When, if ever, these walls go down is anyone's guess.
286880	291080	What is certain, though, is that redirected flight patterns and a return to an almost
291080	295880	exclusively domestic route network marks only the tip of the iceberg as to the long-term
295880	299800	impact of Russia's invasion on Russian aviation.
299800	303600	Beyond the growing divide between Russian and global skies, the country's aviation
303600	307360	industry is also experiencing a new, digital divide.
307360	311800	You see, whether it be a hotel in Zanzibar, a rental car company in Jeju, or a regional
311800	317560	airline in Guatemala, the entire world of travel is all connected by the global distribution
317560	319680	system—the GDS.
319680	324280	At the simplest level, the GDS is a common, connected way to communicate and book inventory
324280	326460	between travel providers.
326460	330480	This and other back-end communication is crucial for airlines in particular since they rely
330480	335600	so heavily on bookings originating from third-party online travel agencies like Google Flights,
335600	340160	Expedia, or Skyscanner, and also on selling tickets that include flights operated by other
340160	341160	airlines.
341160	345360	When a passenger flights Delta from Seattle to Amsterdam, then connects on KLM to Athens,
345360	348320	Delta and KLM's systems need to communicate.
348320	351400	If they didn't, the passenger wouldn't be able to get their KLM boarding pass when
351400	354440	checking in in Seattle, they wouldn't be able to check their bag all the way through
354440	359440	to Athens, they wouldn't be able to get help from KLM if a Delta delay led to a misconnection,
359440	364480	back-end communication is crucial for the cohesive travel experience from airline to
364480	365480	airline.
365480	372520	Now, GDS software is essentially run by three companies—Amadeus, Sabre, and Travelport—combined,
372520	374560	they hold the market outright.
374560	379400	Therefore, the announcement that all three GDS providers were suspending Aeroflot's
379400	383160	access was considered a death blow for the airline.
383160	387320	This decision was guided by the fact that Aeroflot is a majority state-owned airline,
387320	391840	and so Aeroflot revenue would go directly to the very entity funding the deadly invasion
391840	392840	of Ukraine.
392840	398640	Now, without access to the GDS, Aeroflot flights no longer appear on Google Flights, Expedia,
398640	404600	Skyscanner, or any other online travel agency—to book, one must go directly to Aeroflot's
404600	405600	website.
405600	410040	In addition, and perhaps more crucially, Aeroflot flights can no longer be booked as part of
410040	412480	itineraries with other airlines.
412480	416840	While most international airlines have suspended service to Russia, Middle Eastern carriers,
417360	421640	namely Turkish, Qatar, Etihad, and Emirates, have emerged as a crucial air bridge for the
421640	426000	country—one of the few convenient ways in or out, especially when heading to western
426000	427000	destinations.
427000	431060	Etihad in particular used to co-chair with Aeroflot, allowing a passenger to book a ticket
431060	436640	from Abu Dhabi to Moscow, then seamlessly connect onwards on Aeroflot to Sochi, for example.
436640	439440	Without GDS, this is no longer possible.
439440	443820	Therefore, there's no easy way to travel from outside of Russia to anywhere beyond
443820	449780	the destinations of those few inbound international flights—essentially anywhere but Moscow.
449780	453860	While privately owned airlines in Russia have yet to be removed from the GDS, all restrictions
453860	459660	combined mean that Russia's relative distance to the world has now dramatically increased.
459660	463660	Traveling from London to Murmansk, for example, used to be thoroughly simple—a three-hour
463660	467780	Aeroflot flight from Heathrow to Moscow, a one-hour connection, then a two-hour flight
467780	469620	north to the Arctic city.
469620	474940	Now, however, the most efficient way of that journey is likely a full ten-hour travel day
474940	479980	on Turkish airlines from London to Istanbul to Moscow, an overnight at an airport hotel,
479980	483900	then a morning flight the next day on Aeroflot to finally arrive in Murmansk.
483900	490020	That's to say, the fastest way to get between two cities a mere 1,600 miles or 2,600 kilometers
490020	493740	apart now takes longer than flying from London to Sydney.
493740	498180	But even for those flights that can operate for those passengers who are able to book,
498180	501700	there's an open question as to whether there's going to be the aircraft to fly
501700	502700	them.
502700	507140	You see, while many might perceive aircraft as a product, as something sold from manufacturer
507140	510580	to airline, increasingly they're a service.
510580	516180	A majority of the world's commercial aircraft fleet is now made up of leased aircraft—those
516180	520900	owned by an outside company, but rented to airlines for a term of a few years.
520900	524340	Rather than getting on a years-long waiting list to spend a huge amount of working capital
524340	528920	on a single aircraft, airlines have come to enjoy the flexibility of shorter-term lease
528920	529920	agreements.
529920	533900	It allows them to grow and shrink their fleets more easily in response to shifts in demand,
533900	537720	and pay for aircraft as revenue comes in rather than before.
537720	543500	Of Russia's 980 passenger aircraft, 777 are leased.
543500	550020	Of those, two-thirds, or 515, are leased from companies based outside of the country.
550020	553540	Nearly all of those foreign companies are now either required to terminate their lease
553540	557900	agreements due to sanctions imposed by their home country, or have chosen to due to a lack
557900	561700	of faith in Russian Airlines' ability to continue paying due to the collapse of the
561700	565100	ruble and the decimation of international route networks.
565100	570260	Now, as aircraft leasing gained prominence in the early 2000s, a number of nations came
570260	573000	together to sign the Cape Town Treaty.
573000	577540	Like ships, for example, aircraft often spend much or most of their service lives outside
577540	581220	of the country in which they're registered, so an Irish leasing company like AirCap, for
581220	585060	example, can't rely on Irish law to give it the right to repossess an aircraft for
585060	589540	non-payment if it was leased to a foreign airline and located outside of Ireland.
589540	594500	Therefore, the Cape Town Convention made aircraft leases, and especially aircraft repossessions,
594500	596740	enforceable by international law.
596740	600760	It meant that AirCap had a legal right to ask the Russian authorities to help it seize
600760	603860	an Aeroflot aircraft for non-payment or lease termination.
603860	608540	That's, of course, because Russia is a signatory of the Cape Town Treaty.
608540	613660	However, in this case, facing the loss of the majority of its civil aviation fleet,
613660	616420	the nation just decided to ignore it.
616420	622040	In fact, not only did they ignore it, but instead, Russia began a state-sanctioned theft
622040	625940	of billions upon billions of dollars worth of aircraft.
625940	630240	You see, the majority of the aircraft owned by major international leasing companies are
630240	634500	registered in either Ireland or Bermuda, mostly due to tax advantages.
634500	639020	Therefore, when those two countries revoked the certificates of airworthiness for aircraft
639020	643740	logged on their registries but leased to Russian airlines, that meant that nearly all of those
643740	650260	515 aircraft were no longer legally able to fly and that the lessors wanted them back.
650260	655700	However, in response, Putin signed a law allowing Russia's airlines to re-register these aircraft
655700	658900	as Russian, as if they were their own property.
658900	662860	Essentially, Russia is telling its airlines to just keep the planes.
662860	666020	As long as they don't leave the country, they'll stay in their hands.
666020	670000	That means going forward, these aircraft will likely only operate domestic routes, while
670000	674460	fully owned or Russian leased aircraft will operate any international routes.
674460	677360	However, even that could become difficult.
677360	682000	To retain their legal and practical ability to fly, aircraft are continuously subjugated
682000	684940	to an extensive maintenance and inspection schedule.
684940	690180	But now, both Boeing and Airbus have suspended all maintenance support to Russian airlines,
690180	693900	leaving them few options for sourcing legitimate parts.
693900	697620	Without legitimate parts, even legitimately owned aircraft could lose the right to fly
697620	699060	internationally.
699060	704020	And then on top of that, even the Russian-made Sukhoi Superjet, the most common domestic-made
704020	708780	aircraft, faces maintenance issues too as its official part supplier is Lufthansa Technik,
708780	712620	which is based in Germany—a country that has enacted sanctions preventing the company
712620	715220	from supplying parts to Russian airlines.
715260	721220	Now, there is precedent for this situation—Iran's aviation industry operated under similarly
721220	725260	severe sanctions from 2007 to 2015.
725260	729540	This resulted in them holding onto the aircraft they had prior to the sanctions long past
729540	730900	their typical service lives.
730900	735580	When an aircraft part went faulty, focus was placed on repairing it, rather than replacing
735580	740660	it, since nearly all parts replacement required cannibalizing from grounded aircraft.
740660	745100	As time went on, more and more aircraft had to be grounded to supply parts to the flying
745100	749080	airlines, and the country's skies became some of the most dangerous in the world as
749080	752420	safety standards grew increasingly relaxed.
752420	756420	Russia is likely to operate under a similar system—assuming it continues to hold onto
756420	761780	all 980 of its commercial aircraft, it'll have an oversupply due to its airlines'
761780	765100	inability to operate most in-demand international routes.
765100	769180	But, the longer the sanctions stretch on, the more planes will have to be dedicated
769180	774100	to cannibalization, and the fewer there will be that can actually fly.
774100	777940	Beyond the obvious—the absolute destruction of the progress Russian airlines have made
777940	782340	over the past three decades building themselves up into legitimate, safe, respected global
782340	787260	carriers—the near-total disconnection between the Russian and global aviation industries
787260	791020	could actually accelerate progress for certain others.
791020	796220	To start, between Sukhoi and Irkut, Russia has been attempting to revitalize its storied
796220	800700	aircraft manufacturing industry—so far with little success as their aircraft have not
800700	803460	been competitive with those of Western manufacturers.
803500	808500	However, without the competition, these domestic manufacturers will become one of the only
808500	810640	sources for new aircraft.
810640	815060	This could also have a spillover effect for China as their state-owned aircraft manufacturer
815060	820700	COMAC is nearing first deliveries of its C919 aircraft—roughly equivalent to an A320
820700	821700	or 737.
821700	825140	If it's able to make a version free of parts from countries that have sanctioned Russia
825140	829840	or China, which is a big if, COMAC could capture demand from Russia that could not be fulfilled
829840	833380	by COMAC's primary competitors—Boeing and Airbus.
833380	835940	But the implications go further than that.
835940	839740	While the impact of Russia's airspace closure was dulled by weak international travel demand
839740	844660	to and from Asia, with most of the continent's borders still closed in response to the pandemic,
844660	849900	as this demand grows in step with COVID's fade, this could have broad, long-term implications
849900	852580	on the global aviation industry.
852580	856500	Thin Air, based in Helsinki, for example, has long taken advantage of their position
856500	860560	in the northeast of Europe, on the direct path between most major European and Asian
860560	865320	cities, to offer some of the quickest connecting itineraries between the two continents.
865320	869960	In fact, prior to the pandemic, they were the only major European airline which flew
869960	874800	the majority of their long-haul routes to Asia, rather than North America or elsewhere.
874800	879440	However, when Asian travel demand's return started to lag behind the rest of the world's,
879440	883240	Thin Air announced that it would begin flying long-haul routes to destinations in the US
883240	889580	and Thailand from Stockholm—a new, secondary hub to complement its primary one in Helsinki.
889580	893560	In retrospect, that seems an extremely prudent move, and it's likely the airline will
893560	898560	continue on a similar strategic path—reallocating its resources westward in response to its
898560	902100	quick-flip from best-to-worst position for Europe-to-Asia flying.
902100	906740	But as one airport falls, another rises.
906740	910980	Elsewhere in the northern latitudes, Anchorage Airport might regain its strategic status
910980	913740	for Europe-to-Asia flying.
913740	917540	During the Cold War, Anchorage was home to one of the most cosmopolitan airports in the
917540	924020	world as European and Asian airlines used it as refueling stop—avoiding Soviet airspace.
924020	928260	Routing a flight from Tokyo to London via Anchorage does add about four hours to flight
928260	933200	time, but it is essentially the fastest route when overflying Russia isn't an option.
933200	937340	In fact, Japan Airlines flights on that route have already started flying over Anchorage,
937340	942140	although without stopping for fuel since aircraft now have longer ranges than in decades past.
942140	946640	However, the more fuel you add to an aircraft, the heavier it is, and therefore the more
946640	949640	fuel you have to use to carry the added fuel weight.
949640	955200	Essentially, as flight distance increases, average fuel burn per mile increases.
955200	960840	Of course, packages, unlike passengers, don't care about stops, so cargo airlines have long
960840	965120	used Anchorage as a refueling hub on flights between North America and Asia.
965120	969440	Now, however, it's become advantageous to use Anchorage as a stop on their flights between
969440	971640	Asia and Europe as well.
971640	976160	When upon cargo airlines' route from Tokyo to Amsterdam used to fly non-stop in a quick
976160	981760	11.5 hours, the closure of Russian airspace has now made that entirely infeasible.
981760	987260	Instead, it flies northeast for 6.5 hours towards Anchorage, stops for refueling, then
987260	990160	continues nine hours onward to Amsterdam.
990160	994420	Compared to before, this requires four hours of additional flight time, but it's certainly
994420	996360	better than the alternative.
996360	1000760	FedEx is route from Osaka to Paris, for example, normally flying a similar distance between
1000760	1008560	similarly located cities, now flies 11.5 hours first to Dubai, then 7.5 to Paris—19
1008560	1012280	hours of flying for a route that previously took less than 12.
1012280	1017080	If these airspace closures prolong, the airline might opt to route the flight through Anchorage—an
1017080	1020500	itinerary that could save them two hours over Dubai.
1020500	1025260	FedEx and UPS already have major operations at Anchorage, so it's very possible they'll
1025260	1028660	start to expand the model that's worked for Asia to North America flying to Europe
1028660	1031700	as well in this new reality.
1031700	1035280	Passenger airlines, however, are likely to take advantage of modern aircraft's incredible
1035280	1040540	range to continue to run flights to Asia non-stop, even if they physically route over Alaska.
1040540	1046900	However, one start-up airline is likely quietly celebrating the new inaccessibility of Russian
1046900	1048100	skies.
1048100	1051440	Northern Pacific Airways has announced its intention to start flights from Anchorage
1051440	1056300	to both North America and Asia in 2022, with the goal of creating a connecting hub for
1056300	1058180	Trans-Pacific travel.
1058180	1062260	Essentially, they want to become the Iceland air of the Pacific.
1062260	1065720	This start-up does, however, face an uphill battle.
1065720	1069120	Transatlantic fares are some of the highest priced long-haul flights out there on a per-mile
1069120	1073840	basis despite strong competition—the market can sustain it since it's connecting one
1073840	1076440	wealthy area to another.
1076440	1080380	Trans-Pacific fares, meanwhile, are some of the least expensive on a per-mile basis thanks
1080380	1084620	to fierce competition from Asian airlines that enjoy low operating costs and strong
1084620	1085940	state support.
1085940	1091140	Therefore, Northern Pacific Airways is unlikely to be able to offer as strong a cost advantage
1091140	1093660	relative to the market as Iceland air.
1093660	1098100	However, especially for itineraries from the eastern half of North America or to the western
1098100	1102860	parts of Asia, Anchorage has gone from a detour to directly on the route.
1102860	1107380	Delta's flight from Detroit to Seoul, for example, used to take a 13-hour path over
1107380	1112200	flying Russia, but is now having to route via a more southern 14-hour path over flying
1112200	1113200	Anchorage.
1113200	1118120	A passenger originating in Boston flying via Detroit to Seoul on this flight now has a
1118120	1121040	roughly 19-hour itinerary.
1121040	1125300	Northern Pacific, with eight hours from Boston to Anchorage, an hour for a connection, then
1125300	1131040	nine hours onward to Seoul, will now be able to beat Delta by an hour—and even better,
1131040	1134980	by operating two medium-length flights rather than one long and one short flight, their
1134980	1139480	fuel burn per passenger will likely be lower, meaning they might be able to offer lower
1139480	1140480	fares.
1140480	1145180	Not only that, but they could now potentially expand their business model to Europe as well.
1145180	1149680	A flight from Anchorage to London, Amsterdam, or Paris only takes nine hours, so coupled
1149680	1154160	with a six-and-a-half-hour flight from Tokyo to Anchorage, this 17-and-a-half-hour total
1154160	1158900	itinerary would only be two hours longer than the new, circuitous non-stops from western
1158900	1162920	Europe to Asia, and would likely sell at a much lower cost.
1162920	1167700	In comparison to an itinerary connecting from Paris to London to Tokyo, Northern Pacific's
1167700	1169500	itinerary would likely be faster.
1169520	1175240	Now, a European expansion for this as-yet-unlaunched airline is unlikely in the near-term, as their
1175240	1179920	fleet will initially be composed of 757s that cannot confidently reach the major European
1179920	1185960	airports, but if this new reality entrenches into the long-term, it's certainly an option.
1185960	1189680	At the very least, though, this has raised the business model's status from one met
1189680	1194920	with resounding skepticism among experts to one now considered potentially feasible.
1195340	1200340	Now, the short of all these compounding implications is that, across the board really, from western
1200340	1206060	travelers to all strata of Russian society, these changes are going to hurt.
1206060	1209700	The decisions of a few, and the world's response to those decisions, have ensured
1209700	1214660	we'll all feel the squeeze of closed airspace and aviation sanctions.
1214660	1221180	Beyond the economics, though, February 24th, 2022 marks the end of a period of mostly sustained,
1221180	1225120	mostly stable peace between world powers that allowed for unprecedented efficiency
1225120	1230600	and standardization in the skies, and unmatched mobility and convenience for the traveler.
1230600	1235080	The three decades of uniquely open and accessible airways are over.
1235080	1241640	When, or more accurately if we're to return to such a time, at this point, is anyone's
1241640	1242640	guess.
1242640	1248000	If you're anything like me, you typically struggle to decide what to do at dinnertime.
1248000	1252460	Should I have unhealthy freezer food, expensive take-out, or a time-consuming home-cooked
1252460	1253460	meal?
1253460	1257940	Of course, I no longer have to make this decision since, for the past two years, I've used
1257940	1258940	HelloFresh.
1258940	1263360	That's because it's simultaneously healthy, affordable, and quick.
1263360	1268060	Each week, I select the meals I want on their app, then the next, a box arrives on my doorstep
1268060	1271560	with all the ingredients needed in exactly the right quantities needed.
1271560	1274740	This cuts out all your shopping time and a lot of your prep time so you get straight
1274740	1275740	to the fun part—cooking.
1276480	1280720	For example, I made this delicious buffalo spice chicken in under 30 minutes.
1280720	1283480	Also, HelloFresh is a more sustainable choice.
1283480	1287240	Unlike the grocery store, they offset all their emissions, their packaging is made out
1287240	1291500	of recycled content, and a University of Michigan study found that the pre-portioned ingredients
1291500	1295120	lower food waste by 25% compared to grocery shopping.
1295120	1299060	All around, HelloFresh just makes mealtime better, and that's why I've been using
1299060	1301160	them since long before they sponsored the channel.
1301160	1304780	I recommend you try them out as well, which you can do with an insanely good deal when
1304820	1309980	you click the button on screen or go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOWFOR16 for up to 16 free
1309980	1312560	meals and three surprise gifts.
