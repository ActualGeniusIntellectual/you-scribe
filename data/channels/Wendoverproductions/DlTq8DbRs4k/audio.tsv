10960	20280	On Thursday, May 3rd, 1979, 31,221,362 voters gathered at polling stations across the United
20280	25840	Kingdom to decide on who would fill the 650 seats of the House of Commons.
25840	32240	Now, any election is important, but this one held particular significance.
32240	37000	Over the years leading up to it, the country's manufacturing industry was collapsing, inflation
37000	41400	was wreaking havoc on the economy, mass strikes were plaguing both the public and private
41400	46400	sector, unemployment was exploding, and it was quickly becoming clear that Britain was
46400	53240	losing ground to Japan, Germany, the US, and other subjects of post-war economic booms.
53240	57720	Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party proposed a solution—they would curb the
57720	64220	power of unions, cut personal income tax, and privatize nationalized industries—essentially,
64220	69440	it was a complete rejection of the economic ideology of the prior 30 years.
69440	74520	However, in the view of the British public, the status quo was what got them to the turmoil
74520	78520	of the era, so Thatcher's message resonated.
78520	83600	Once the ballots were counted, the Conservative Party picked up 62 new seats, bringing their
83600	90280	total to 339, a majority, and therefore making Margaret Thatcher Prime Minister of the United
90280	91960	Kingdom.
91960	97080	The era of British privatization started quite quickly—first with British Petroleum, of
97080	101520	which Thatcher began selling off shares just months following her appointment.
101520	106360	But then, in the new decade, the trend kicks into high gear with British Aerospace, British
106360	113000	Gas, Rolls-Royce, British Airways, British Steel, National Express, British Telecom,
113000	118220	British Leyland, the British Airports Authority, and dozens more state-owned enterprises being
118220	120420	sold off to the private sector.
120420	125800	By the 1990s, the concept of a state-owned enterprise was becoming increasingly obscure,
125800	133920	but there was just one major sector that the sell-offs had yet to really touch—the railroads.
133920	137560	Thatcher herself didn't dare touch them.
137560	139600	Politically, it was tricky.
139600	145000	In the country, trains operated at a loss to many rural areas from which her party needed
145000	146000	votes.
146000	150520	Fully privatizing the industry would mean that those areas would inevitably lose service,
150520	154120	and the Conservative Party would inevitably lose votes.
154120	159240	In addition, in her view, railroads were just one of the rare examples of sectors that just
159240	161080	had to be publicly run.
161080	166760	They were just too tricky to run both efficiently and effectively with a purely profit-seeking
166760	168000	motive.
168000	172640	Her reign ended, though, in 1990, after a leadership battle within her own party, and
172640	176000	her successors weren't so cautious.
176000	181000	Conveniently, in 1991, the European Union acted first.
181000	186940	It issued directive 91-440, which read, quote, "...whereas the future development and efficient
186940	191340	operation of the railway system may be made easier if a distinction is made between the
191340	196900	provision of transport services and the operation of infrastructure, whereas given this situation,
196900	201540	it is necessary for these two activities to be separately managed and have separate accounts."
201540	207820	Essentially, what this said was that the companies, organizations, or agencies that actually operated
207820	212800	the trains had to be legally separate entities from those that operated and owned the tracks
212800	215100	upon which trains operated.
215100	220180	The reasoning stemmed from the EU's wish for private rail competition against the government-run
220180	221420	systems.
221420	225640	They were opening the door for companies to operate rail services on any track in the
225640	229540	European Union, as long as they paid for it.
229540	234720	Of course, that gave the government a perfect first target for privatization.
234720	242460	On April 1st, 1994, Railtrack came into existence—a private company that now owned all the tracks,
242460	246000	stations, and rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom.
246000	250260	There was much work left to do, though—British Rail's trains went to three newly formed
250260	256080	rolling stock companies, their telecoms infrastructure was sold to Racal Electronics, freight operations
256080	261360	were split up and allocated to six newly formed private companies, and this process went on
261360	266580	and on and on, but then came the question of passenger train services.
267200	274680	It was very clear that the solution to privatizing those would not be a quick and complete sell-off.
274680	279840	The crux of the problem was exactly what Thatcher had identified when she decided not to privatize
279840	286840	the railways—the public had come to expect and rely on inherently loss-making rail operations.
286840	292320	While running an 8am train from Edinburgh to London may be profitable, running a 1pm
292320	295560	train from Manchester to Buxton probably is not.
295560	300400	In order to run trains at the prices, to the places, and with the frequency the public
300400	306280	demanded, someone had to at least sometimes take a loss.
306280	309180	With that, a structure evolved.
309180	313980	Intercity, British Rail's long-distance brand, was split into seven segments.
313980	318140	Network South East, which primarily operated commuter services in and around London, was
318140	322940	split into ten, while Regional Railways, which operated short-distance services throughout
322940	325860	the rest of the country, was split into eight.
325860	331180	These 25 train-operating companies would at first be owned and run by the government,
331180	336260	but through time, the operations of each would be franchised out to private companies.
336260	341180	Now, each of the train-operating companies were designed so that their advantages and
341180	345940	disadvantages were, in the view of a private company, somewhat balanced.
345940	351040	That's rather important, since any franchisee is contractually required to serve certain
351040	354880	stations, at certain times, and certain frequencies.
354880	360080	For example, the intercity East Coast franchise includes the super-high-demand, high-frequency
360080	365140	East Coast service from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kings Cross—two of the busiest
365140	370240	train stations in the UK, between which any operator should be able to turn a profit.
370240	375440	However, this franchise also requires, for example, the operator to run at least one
375440	380920	train a day that leaves London Kings Cross between 1130 AM and 1230 PM, and eventually
380920	385900	calls at the small Scottish town of Kingoosie, along with a corresponding southbound service
385900	391400	that calls at the town before arriving at Kings Cross between 530 and 630 PM.
391400	397900	Now, only some 108 people use Kingoosie railway station each day—most to get on the regional
397900	401180	trains running between Glasgow or Edinburgh and Inverness.
401180	405140	A private company likely would not choose to service a station where they'd be lucky
405140	410160	to pick up a dozen passengers in a day, so the intention of the franchising system was
410160	414960	to balance things out—put a little bit of the bad with the good—so that places
414960	418660	like Kingoosie would not lose their service.
418660	422520	To further balance things out, the government would accept bids from companies to operate
422520	427660	the different franchises, and what the government would receive could either be in the positive
427660	429420	or the negative.
429420	433540	The government would look at all the serious bids and quite simply pick the one that would
433540	438140	make them the most money in incoming franchise payments, or lose them the least money in
438140	440120	outgoing subsidies.
440120	443660	On the surface, it seemed like the perfect system.
443660	449740	The free market would force companies to compete to win a franchise, and, in the end, the government,
449740	454960	and by extension the British taxpayer, would spend the least amount or earn the most amount
454960	456820	of money possible.
456820	460320	But that's just the view from the surface.
460320	464240	If you dive in and take a deeper look at the franchise agreement—the contract between
464240	468420	an operator and the government—cracks begin to show.
468420	473500	This document is the draft of that agreement for the Intercity East Coast franchise—the
473500	478480	one that includes Edinburgh to London service—published by the UK government during the latest tendering
478480	480840	process in 2014.
480840	485200	It begins with definitions of terms, a statement of governing law, and assorted other legal
485200	489960	declarations, but then moves on to exactly how the relationship between a franchisee
489960	491940	and the government will work.
491940	497160	For example, in Schedule 1.1 Part A Section 4, it lays out the idea that franchisees cannot
497160	500940	alter the timetable without a long, arduous process of consultation with the government
500940	503560	and other stakeholders, including the public.
503560	507400	Section 7 established the requirements for operators to, on average, have the capacity
507400	511100	for anyone to find a seat immediately upon boarding and off-peak trains, and within twenty
511100	513380	minutes of boarding for on-peak trains.
513380	517020	Section 12 introduces the concept of breach performance levels, which, if a franchisee
517020	519860	exceeds, will put them in breach of contract.
519860	526180	For example, the Intercity East Coast franchisee must not exceed 0.0235 cancellations per 1,000
526180	530200	miles or 1,600 kilometers traveled in its second year of operations, and by the end
530200	536080	of year 10, if their franchise even lasts that long, the level must be down to 0.0119.
536080	539960	Schedule 1.2 Part A Section 6 lays out the requirements for alternate transportation
539960	542120	in the event of train cancellation.
542120	545600	This section outlines the requirements for timetable publishing and poster display at
545600	546600	stations.
546600	549140	This one defines the operator's data reporting requirements.
549140	552600	This one outlines the requirement for operators to accept folding bikes on all its services
552600	555900	and full-sized bikes quote, wherever reasonably practical.
555900	560240	This establishes the prohibition of the franchisees engaging in any business except for the operation
560240	563680	of trains and certain auxiliary services like selling food on board.
563680	567560	This outlines the franchisees' ban on entering into any leases without government approval,
567560	572080	and the leases for stations, depots, and other facilities that it's required to enter into,
572080	576400	and this section summarizes what the franchisee is legally required to help with for the operation
576400	579000	of the Queen or subsequent monarch's train.
579000	584280	So, the government tells franchisees where they must operate, when they must operate,
584280	589740	which trains they must operate, which facilities they must lease, the maximum amount they can
589740	595140	charge, how long they can operate, so the question is, with very, very little ability
595140	601140	to choose how to run their trains, where are they supposed to compete?
601140	604020	The answer is the bidding process.
604020	609840	That's essentially the only step in this process where free-market competitive economics
609840	615220	come into play, but these forces pushed bidders to over-promise and under-deliver.
615220	620080	They'd say they expected a certain number of passengers, translating to a certain amount
620080	624800	of profit, leading to a certain hypothetical future franchise payment—the main number
624800	627360	that the government looks at in a bid.
627360	632120	If those passengers didn't appear as predicted, then the profit didn't come either, and
632120	636660	the franchisee would fail to make the payments upon which it bid.
636660	641700	This is a cycle that happened time and time and time again.
641700	647780	GNER, owned by Sea Containers, was the first operator of the intercity East Coast franchise,
647780	652600	before it overbid in its renewal, failed to make its payments to the government, and lost
652600	654440	the franchise early.
654440	659180	To replace them, the government awarded the franchise to National Express in 2007, who
659180	663220	would operate the services under the National Express East Coast brand.
663220	668500	However, just two years later, it emerged that they too had forecast more passengers
668500	672940	than emerged in reality, were not able to make the payments they had bid on, and so
672940	676760	they lost the franchise in 2009.
676760	682140	After this experience, the government temporarily re-nationalized the railway under the operator
682140	686660	of last resort scheme that had been set up for this exact situation.
686660	691540	The succinctly named East Coast Company, owned and run by the government, operated the line
691540	694980	until a new bidding process was opened in 2013.
694980	699820	A joint venture between Stagecoach and the Virgin Group won the bid, and operated services
699820	702820	under the Virgin Train's East Coast brand.
702820	707860	It turned out that passenger, and therefore revenue growth, had not matched the levels
707860	712020	they had based their bid upon, therefore they were hemorrhaging money, therefore they could
712020	717420	not make their franchise payments to the government, therefore they lost the franchise in 2018,
717420	722880	and once again, the government re-nationalized the line and operated services under the London
722880	725940	Northeastern Railway brand.
725940	731800	Throughout this nearly 25-year cycle, only one period stood out from the rest.
731800	738560	Between November 14, 2009 and February 28, 2015, when the line was run by the government-owned
738560	744240	East Coast Train Operating Company, things went… well.
744240	749600	In its final full year of operation, it was tied for fourth among 23 train operating companies
749600	754720	in terms of overall passenger satisfaction, fifth for punctuality, fourth for value for
754720	759680	money, and, even while being one of the most popular train companies, it generated over
759680	764280	one billion pounds in profit over the years that went straight back to the government
764280	767480	and, by extension, the British public.
767720	773680	Therefore, when it was announced that the franchise was to be re-privatized, many asked
773680	775260	why.
775260	780400	Why should the government hand over a well-run, well-liked, well-profitable company to private
780400	786240	hands which will, at best, just take a portion of those profits away from the British government
786240	787500	and people?
787500	792420	Over the following years, this and other related questions, doubting the merits of this almost
792420	797160	entirely unique franchise model, grew louder and louder.
797160	802880	By the start of 2020, an increasing number of railways stopped operating under the franchising
802880	803880	model.
803880	807160	Instead, they were run as concessions, where the government contracts a company to operate
807160	811720	trains while taking the financial risk themselves, open access operators, where private companies
811720	815680	simply pay for track access, typically on the most lucrative routes, without any additional
815680	820120	agreement with the government, or the operator of last resort model, such as with the East
820120	823840	Coast franchise, where the line is re-nationalized and government-run.
824800	830380	Simultaneously, it was getting tougher and tougher to find new, reputable bidders for
830380	832920	franchises up for renewal.
832920	836520	Many were extended through direct award, where the government skips the competitive bidding
836520	841360	process, which goes against the original vision of rail franchising.
841360	846560	All around, the viability of the franchising model was coming more and more into question
846560	851720	both domestically and internationally, where complete rail privatization was something
851720	856560	few countries had even considered, let alone implemented.
856560	864160	Like with so many things, though, March, 2020 dealt a death blow to the United Kingdom's
864160	866240	privatized railroads.
866240	871120	With the onset of stay-at-home orders in Britain, passenger numbers fell through the floor,
871120	877420	and it became very clear, very quickly, that no franchisee would be able to fulfill their
877420	880240	obligations to the government.
880240	886800	Therefore, after years, even decades of debate on whether the railroads should be re-nationalized,
886800	889920	it just happened… in a day.
889920	894320	Secretary of State for Transport Grant Schnapps issued a letter to Parliament stating that
894320	899120	all franchises would immediately be shifted to a concession model.
899120	903940	The government would pay all their costs, plus a small management fee equal to no more
903940	908960	than 2% of the company's costs in the year leading up to the pandemic.
908960	915160	For any definition, even if private companies were operating the trains, this was a nationalized
915160	916160	railway.
916160	921880	Originally, this was to go on only for six months, just as a temporary measure, but in
921880	928360	the final days of that period, on September 21st, another announcement was made.
928360	935680	After 24 years, rail franchising, as an operating model, was done.
935680	936920	Forever.
936920	942400	Now, as of yet, it's not known exactly how the country's railways will operate once
942400	945700	the provisional recovery measures lapse.
945700	950440	The most we know comes from the Transport Secretary, who said in the initial announcement,
950440	955880	"...the model of privatization adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger
955880	960840	numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working.
960840	964160	Our new deal for rail demands more for passengers.
964160	969240	It will simplify people's journeys, ending the uncertainty and confusion about whether
969240	972080	you're using the right ticket or the right train company.
972080	976800	It will keep the best elements of the private sector, including competition and investment,
976800	983120	that have helped to drive growth, but deliver strategic direction, leadership, and accountability.
983120	988520	Passengers will have reliable, safe services on a network totally built around them.
988520	992520	It's time to get Britain back on track."
993040	998960	Now, there has always been and will always be debate on whether the privatizations of
998960	1001380	the UK's railways was a failure.
1001380	1005640	It brought the highest number of passengers onto the rails in the country's history,
1005640	1010320	higher even than during the golden age of rail transport in the early 1900s, but it
1010320	1015360	also brought, by most measures, some of the highest fares in all of Europe.
1015360	1019080	It increased the public satisfaction in the railroads and brought it to one of the highest
1019080	1024060	levels in Europe, but counterintuitively, it also pulled the government's rail subsidy
1024060	1026760	up to its highest level in history.
1026760	1031760	Quite decisively, after privatization, the decline of the UK's rail industry turned
1031760	1036640	around for the better, but what's not clear is how much of that can be attributed to the
1036640	1043040	privatization itself, rather than the increased focus that privatization brought to the rails.
1043040	1048080	What is clear, though, is that the experiment itself failed in proving the resilience of
1048080	1050200	the franchising model.
1050200	1054960	Despite positive public sentiment about the railways as a whole, an overwhelming majority
1054960	1057160	of the British public supported re-nationalization.
1057160	1063840	Therefore, it did not start a domino effect of rail privatization across Europe and the
1063840	1069520	world, it did not convince the general public in its merits, and it proved, most of all,
1069520	1074600	that the model was fundamentally flawed as it only worked in the best of times, and the
1074600	1078280	worst of times will always eventually come.
1078280	1083320	While the privatization and deregulation of the air transport industry, for example, rail's
1083320	1088360	most direct competitor, is almost universally viewed as a success that brought lower fares
1088360	1093620	and industry growth to the point that state-owned airlines are now largely a relic of antiquity,
1093620	1096360	the same cannot be said for rail.
1096360	1103760	No country has really cracked the nut of fully-privatized passenger train service in the 21st century.
1103760	1108080	While many have taken half measures such as privatizing freight, the rails, awarding
1108080	1112560	concessions to private operators betaking on the financial risk like the UK now does,
1112560	1117380	or even doing as the UK did before and effectively fully privatizing railways, none have landed
1117380	1123080	on a privatization model successful enough for other countries to replicate it en masse.
1123080	1129140	So, even if the UK's privatization experiment accomplished some of its goals, it failed
1129140	1131060	on the most elusive one.
1131060	1136580	It failed to convince the UK public and the world that the privatization of railroads
1136580	1143380	was the best path forward for passenger train travel in the 21st century.
1143380	1148340	What the past year has proven time and time again is just how important digital presence
1148340	1149660	is.
1149660	1154500	Having a nice, clean, digital presence is getting to be almost as important as having
1154500	1157340	a nice, clean, physical presence.
1157340	1161540	Whether you're still in school, or in the big scary world of employment, this still
1161540	1166520	applies, and one of the quickest and easiest ways to improve your digital presence is with
1166520	1168900	a custom domain from Hover.
1168900	1173300	Even if you don't want to build a website just yet, it's worth getting one for three
1173300	1174660	main reasons.
1174660	1179300	First, you can direct it to your LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, or any other page, so when
1179300	1182340	you share those with someone, it's just one simple link.
1182340	1186720	Second, you can set up a custom email address at that domain, which just looks and feels
1186720	1191720	so much more professional than one ending in at Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, or something else.
1191720	1196020	And third, domains are going away with every minute, so if you want one that corresponds
1196020	1201240	to your own name, company name, or anything else, it's worth getting now before it's
1201240	1202240	gone.
1202240	1206540	Hover makes all of that super simple and quick, they help you find super unique domains with
1206540	1211940	their over 400 extensions, their pricing is very transparent and fair, and best of all,
1211940	1217660	you can get 10% off and help support this channel by going to hover.com slash wendover.
1217660	1222540	So, professionalize your web presence and get your domain before it's gone for 10%
1222540	1226500	off, once again, at hover.com slash wendover.
