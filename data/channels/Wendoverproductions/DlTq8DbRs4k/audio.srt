3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:20,280
On Thursday, May 3rd, 1979, 31,221,362 voters gathered at polling stations across the United

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,840
Kingdom to decide on who would fill the 650 seats of the House of Commons.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,240
Now, any election is important, but this one held particular significance.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,000
Over the years leading up to it, the country's manufacturing industry was collapsing, inflation

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,400
was wreaking havoc on the economy, mass strikes were plaguing both the public and private

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,400
sector, unemployment was exploding, and it was quickly becoming clear that Britain was

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:53,240
losing ground to Japan, Germany, the US, and other subjects of post-war economic booms.

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,720
Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party proposed a solution—they would curb the

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,220
power of unions, cut personal income tax, and privatize nationalized industries—essentially,

12
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,440
it was a complete rejection of the economic ideology of the prior 30 years.

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,520
However, in the view of the British public, the status quo was what got them to the turmoil

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,520
of the era, so Thatcher's message resonated.

15
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,600
Once the ballots were counted, the Conservative Party picked up 62 new seats, bringing their

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,280
total to 339, a majority, and therefore making Margaret Thatcher Prime Minister of the United

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,960
Kingdom.

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,080
The era of British privatization started quite quickly—first with British Petroleum, of

19
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,520
which Thatcher began selling off shares just months following her appointment.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,360
But then, in the new decade, the trend kicks into high gear with British Aerospace, British

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:53,000
Gas, Rolls-Royce, British Airways, British Steel, National Express, British Telecom,

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,220
British Leyland, the British Airports Authority, and dozens more state-owned enterprises being

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,420
sold off to the private sector.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,800
By the 1990s, the concept of a state-owned enterprise was becoming increasingly obscure,

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:13,920
but there was just one major sector that the sell-offs had yet to really touch—the railroads.

26
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,560
Thatcher herself didn't dare touch them.

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,600
Politically, it was tricky.

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,000
In the country, trains operated at a loss to many rural areas from which her party needed

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
votes.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,520
Fully privatizing the industry would mean that those areas would inevitably lose service,

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,120
and the Conservative Party would inevitably lose votes.

32
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,240
In addition, in her view, railroads were just one of the rare examples of sectors that just

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,080
had to be publicly run.

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,760
They were just too tricky to run both efficiently and effectively with a purely profit-seeking

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,000
motive.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,640
Her reign ended, though, in 1990, after a leadership battle within her own party, and

37
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,000
her successors weren't so cautious.

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Conveniently, in 1991, the European Union acted first.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,940
It issued directive 91-440, which read, quote, "...whereas the future development and efficient

40
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,340
operation of the railway system may be made easier if a distinction is made between the

41
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,900
provision of transport services and the operation of infrastructure, whereas given this situation,

42
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,540
it is necessary for these two activities to be separately managed and have separate accounts."

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,820
Essentially, what this said was that the companies, organizations, or agencies that actually operated

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,800
the trains had to be legally separate entities from those that operated and owned the tracks

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,100
upon which trains operated.

46
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,180
The reasoning stemmed from the EU's wish for private rail competition against the government-run

47
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,420
systems.

48
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,640
They were opening the door for companies to operate rail services on any track in the

49
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,540
European Union, as long as they paid for it.

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,720
Of course, that gave the government a perfect first target for privatization.

51
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,460
On April 1st, 1994, Railtrack came into existence—a private company that now owned all the tracks,

52
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:06,000
stations, and rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom.

53
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,260
There was much work left to do, though—British Rail's trains went to three newly formed

54
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:16,080
rolling stock companies, their telecoms infrastructure was sold to Racal Electronics, freight operations

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,360
were split up and allocated to six newly formed private companies, and this process went on

56
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,580
and on and on, but then came the question of passenger train services.

57
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,680
It was very clear that the solution to privatizing those would not be a quick and complete sell-off.

58
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,840
The crux of the problem was exactly what Thatcher had identified when she decided not to privatize

59
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,840
the railways—the public had come to expect and rely on inherently loss-making rail operations.

60
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,320
While running an 8am train from Edinburgh to London may be profitable, running a 1pm

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,560
train from Manchester to Buxton probably is not.

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,400
In order to run trains at the prices, to the places, and with the frequency the public

63
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,280
demanded, someone had to at least sometimes take a loss.

64
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,180
With that, a structure evolved.

65
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,980
Intercity, British Rail's long-distance brand, was split into seven segments.

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,140
Network South East, which primarily operated commuter services in and around London, was

67
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,940
split into ten, while Regional Railways, which operated short-distance services throughout

68
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,860
the rest of the country, was split into eight.

69
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,180
These 25 train-operating companies would at first be owned and run by the government,

70
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,260
but through time, the operations of each would be franchised out to private companies.

71
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,180
Now, each of the train-operating companies were designed so that their advantages and

72
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,940
disadvantages were, in the view of a private company, somewhat balanced.

73
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,040
That's rather important, since any franchisee is contractually required to serve certain

74
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,880
stations, at certain times, and certain frequencies.

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,080
For example, the intercity East Coast franchise includes the super-high-demand, high-frequency

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,140
East Coast service from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kings Cross—two of the busiest

77
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,240
train stations in the UK, between which any operator should be able to turn a profit.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
However, this franchise also requires, for example, the operator to run at least one

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,920
train a day that leaves London Kings Cross between 1130 AM and 1230 PM, and eventually

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:25,900
calls at the small Scottish town of Kingoosie, along with a corresponding southbound service

81
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,400
that calls at the town before arriving at Kings Cross between 530 and 630 PM.

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:37,900
Now, only some 108 people use Kingoosie railway station each day—most to get on the regional

83
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,180
trains running between Glasgow or Edinburgh and Inverness.

84
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,140
A private company likely would not choose to service a station where they'd be lucky

85
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,160
to pick up a dozen passengers in a day, so the intention of the franchising system was

86
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,960
to balance things out—put a little bit of the bad with the good—so that places

87
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,660
like Kingoosie would not lose their service.

88
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,520
To further balance things out, the government would accept bids from companies to operate

89
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,660
the different franchises, and what the government would receive could either be in the positive

90
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,420
or the negative.

91
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,540
The government would look at all the serious bids and quite simply pick the one that would

92
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,140
make them the most money in incoming franchise payments, or lose them the least money in

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,120
outgoing subsidies.

94
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,660
On the surface, it seemed like the perfect system.

95
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:29,740
The free market would force companies to compete to win a franchise, and, in the end, the government,

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,960
and by extension the British taxpayer, would spend the least amount or earn the most amount

97
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,820
of money possible.

98
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,320
But that's just the view from the surface.

99
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,240
If you dive in and take a deeper look at the franchise agreement—the contract between

100
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,420
an operator and the government—cracks begin to show.

101
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:53,500
This document is the draft of that agreement for the Intercity East Coast franchise—the

102
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,480
one that includes Edinburgh to London service—published by the UK government during the latest tendering

103
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,840
process in 2014.

104
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,200
It begins with definitions of terms, a statement of governing law, and assorted other legal

105
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,960
declarations, but then moves on to exactly how the relationship between a franchisee

106
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,940
and the government will work.

107
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,160
For example, in Schedule 1.1 Part A Section 4, it lays out the idea that franchisees cannot

108
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,940
alter the timetable without a long, arduous process of consultation with the government

109
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,560
and other stakeholders, including the public.

110
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,400
Section 7 established the requirements for operators to, on average, have the capacity

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,100
for anyone to find a seat immediately upon boarding and off-peak trains, and within twenty

112
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,380
minutes of boarding for on-peak trains.

113
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:37,020
Section 12 introduces the concept of breach performance levels, which, if a franchisee

114
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,860
exceeds, will put them in breach of contract.

115
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:46,180
For example, the Intercity East Coast franchisee must not exceed 0.0235 cancellations per 1,000

116
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,200
miles or 1,600 kilometers traveled in its second year of operations, and by the end

117
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:56,080
of year 10, if their franchise even lasts that long, the level must be down to 0.0119.

118
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,960
Schedule 1.2 Part A Section 6 lays out the requirements for alternate transportation

119
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,120
in the event of train cancellation.

120
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,600
This section outlines the requirements for timetable publishing and poster display at

121
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
stations.

122
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,140
This one defines the operator's data reporting requirements.

123
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,600
This one outlines the requirement for operators to accept folding bikes on all its services

124
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,900
and full-sized bikes quote, wherever reasonably practical.

125
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,240
This establishes the prohibition of the franchisees engaging in any business except for the operation

126
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,680
of trains and certain auxiliary services like selling food on board.

127
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,560
This outlines the franchisees' ban on entering into any leases without government approval,

128
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,080
and the leases for stations, depots, and other facilities that it's required to enter into,

129
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,400
and this section summarizes what the franchisee is legally required to help with for the operation

130
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
of the Queen or subsequent monarch's train.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,280
So, the government tells franchisees where they must operate, when they must operate,

132
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,740
which trains they must operate, which facilities they must lease, the maximum amount they can

133
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,140
charge, how long they can operate, so the question is, with very, very little ability

134
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,140
to choose how to run their trains, where are they supposed to compete?

135
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,020
The answer is the bidding process.

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:09,840
That's essentially the only step in this process where free-market competitive economics

137
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:15,220
come into play, but these forces pushed bidders to over-promise and under-deliver.

138
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,080
They'd say they expected a certain number of passengers, translating to a certain amount

139
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,800
of profit, leading to a certain hypothetical future franchise payment—the main number

140
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,360
that the government looks at in a bid.

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,120
If those passengers didn't appear as predicted, then the profit didn't come either, and

142
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,660
the franchisee would fail to make the payments upon which it bid.

143
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,700
This is a cycle that happened time and time and time again.

144
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,780
GNER, owned by Sea Containers, was the first operator of the intercity East Coast franchise,

145
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,600
before it overbid in its renewal, failed to make its payments to the government, and lost

146
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,440
the franchise early.

147
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,180
To replace them, the government awarded the franchise to National Express in 2007, who

148
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,220
would operate the services under the National Express East Coast brand.

149
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,500
However, just two years later, it emerged that they too had forecast more passengers

150
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,940
than emerged in reality, were not able to make the payments they had bid on, and so

151
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,760
they lost the franchise in 2009.

152
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:22,140
After this experience, the government temporarily re-nationalized the railway under the operator

153
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,660
of last resort scheme that had been set up for this exact situation.

154
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,540
The succinctly named East Coast Company, owned and run by the government, operated the line

155
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,980
until a new bidding process was opened in 2013.

156
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,820
A joint venture between Stagecoach and the Virgin Group won the bid, and operated services

157
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
under the Virgin Train's East Coast brand.

158
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,860
It turned out that passenger, and therefore revenue growth, had not matched the levels

159
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,020
they had based their bid upon, therefore they were hemorrhaging money, therefore they could

160
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:57,420
not make their franchise payments to the government, therefore they lost the franchise in 2018,

161
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,880
and once again, the government re-nationalized the line and operated services under the London

162
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,940
Northeastern Railway brand.

163
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:11,800
Throughout this nearly 25-year cycle, only one period stood out from the rest.

164
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:18,560
Between November 14, 2009 and February 28, 2015, when the line was run by the government-owned

165
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,240
East Coast Train Operating Company, things went… well.

166
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,600
In its final full year of operation, it was tied for fourth among 23 train operating companies

167
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,720
in terms of overall passenger satisfaction, fifth for punctuality, fourth for value for

168
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,680
money, and, even while being one of the most popular train companies, it generated over

169
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,280
one billion pounds in profit over the years that went straight back to the government

170
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,480
and, by extension, the British public.

171
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,680
Therefore, when it was announced that the franchise was to be re-privatized, many asked

172
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,260
why.

173
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,400
Why should the government hand over a well-run, well-liked, well-profitable company to private

174
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,240
hands which will, at best, just take a portion of those profits away from the British government

175
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,500
and people?

176
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,420
Over the following years, this and other related questions, doubting the merits of this almost

177
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,160
entirely unique franchise model, grew louder and louder.

178
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,880
By the start of 2020, an increasing number of railways stopped operating under the franchising

179
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,880
model.

180
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,160
Instead, they were run as concessions, where the government contracts a company to operate

181
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,720
trains while taking the financial risk themselves, open access operators, where private companies

182
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,680
simply pay for track access, typically on the most lucrative routes, without any additional

183
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,120
agreement with the government, or the operator of last resort model, such as with the East

184
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,840
Coast franchise, where the line is re-nationalized and government-run.

185
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,380
Simultaneously, it was getting tougher and tougher to find new, reputable bidders for

186
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,920
franchises up for renewal.

187
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,520
Many were extended through direct award, where the government skips the competitive bidding

188
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,360
process, which goes against the original vision of rail franchising.

189
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,560
All around, the viability of the franchising model was coming more and more into question

190
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,720
both domestically and internationally, where complete rail privatization was something

191
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,560
few countries had even considered, let alone implemented.

192
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:24,160
Like with so many things, though, March, 2020 dealt a death blow to the United Kingdom's

193
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,240
privatized railroads.

194
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,120
With the onset of stay-at-home orders in Britain, passenger numbers fell through the floor,

195
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,420
and it became very clear, very quickly, that no franchisee would be able to fulfill their

196
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,240
obligations to the government.

197
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,800
Therefore, after years, even decades of debate on whether the railroads should be re-nationalized,

198
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,920
it just happened… in a day.

199
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,320
Secretary of State for Transport Grant Schnapps issued a letter to Parliament stating that

200
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,120
all franchises would immediately be shifted to a concession model.

201
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,940
The government would pay all their costs, plus a small management fee equal to no more

202
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,960
than 2% of the company's costs in the year leading up to the pandemic.

203
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,160
For any definition, even if private companies were operating the trains, this was a nationalized

204
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
railway.

205
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,880
Originally, this was to go on only for six months, just as a temporary measure, but in

206
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,360
the final days of that period, on September 21st, another announcement was made.

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:35,680
After 24 years, rail franchising, as an operating model, was done.

208
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,920
Forever.

209
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,400
Now, as of yet, it's not known exactly how the country's railways will operate once

210
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,700
the provisional recovery measures lapse.

211
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,440
The most we know comes from the Transport Secretary, who said in the initial announcement,

212
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,880
"...the model of privatization adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger

213
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,840
numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working.

214
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,160
Our new deal for rail demands more for passengers.

215
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,240
It will simplify people's journeys, ending the uncertainty and confusion about whether

216
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,080
you're using the right ticket or the right train company.

217
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,800
It will keep the best elements of the private sector, including competition and investment,

218
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,120
that have helped to drive growth, but deliver strategic direction, leadership, and accountability.

219
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,520
Passengers will have reliable, safe services on a network totally built around them.

220
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,520
It's time to get Britain back on track."

221
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,960
Now, there has always been and will always be debate on whether the privatizations of

222
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,380
the UK's railways was a failure.

223
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,640
It brought the highest number of passengers onto the rails in the country's history,

224
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,320
higher even than during the golden age of rail transport in the early 1900s, but it

225
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,360
also brought, by most measures, some of the highest fares in all of Europe.

226
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,080
It increased the public satisfaction in the railroads and brought it to one of the highest

227
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:04,060
levels in Europe, but counterintuitively, it also pulled the government's rail subsidy

228
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,760
up to its highest level in history.

229
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Quite decisively, after privatization, the decline of the UK's rail industry turned

230
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,640
around for the better, but what's not clear is how much of that can be attributed to the

231
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,040
privatization itself, rather than the increased focus that privatization brought to the rails.

232
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,080
What is clear, though, is that the experiment itself failed in proving the resilience of

233
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,200
the franchising model.

234
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,960
Despite positive public sentiment about the railways as a whole, an overwhelming majority

235
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,160
of the British public supported re-nationalization.

236
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:43,840
Therefore, it did not start a domino effect of rail privatization across Europe and the

237
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,520
world, it did not convince the general public in its merits, and it proved, most of all,

238
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,600
that the model was fundamentally flawed as it only worked in the best of times, and the

239
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,280
worst of times will always eventually come.

240
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:03,320
While the privatization and deregulation of the air transport industry, for example, rail's

241
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,360
most direct competitor, is almost universally viewed as a success that brought lower fares

242
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,620
and industry growth to the point that state-owned airlines are now largely a relic of antiquity,

243
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,360
the same cannot be said for rail.

244
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,760
No country has really cracked the nut of fully-privatized passenger train service in the 21st century.

245
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,080
While many have taken half measures such as privatizing freight, the rails, awarding

246
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,560
concessions to private operators betaking on the financial risk like the UK now does,

247
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,380
or even doing as the UK did before and effectively fully privatizing railways, none have landed

248
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,080
on a privatization model successful enough for other countries to replicate it en masse.

249
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:49,140
So, even if the UK's privatization experiment accomplished some of its goals, it failed

250
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,060
on the most elusive one.

251
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,580
It failed to convince the UK public and the world that the privatization of railroads

252
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,380
was the best path forward for passenger train travel in the 21st century.

253
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,340
What the past year has proven time and time again is just how important digital presence

254
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,660
is.

255
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,500
Having a nice, clean, digital presence is getting to be almost as important as having

256
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,340
a nice, clean, physical presence.

257
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:21,540
Whether you're still in school, or in the big scary world of employment, this still

258
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:26,520
applies, and one of the quickest and easiest ways to improve your digital presence is with

259
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,900
a custom domain from Hover.

260
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Even if you don't want to build a website just yet, it's worth getting one for three

261
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,660
main reasons.

262
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,300
First, you can direct it to your LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, or any other page, so when

263
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,340
you share those with someone, it's just one simple link.

264
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,720
Second, you can set up a custom email address at that domain, which just looks and feels

265
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,720
so much more professional than one ending in at Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, or something else.

266
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,020
And third, domains are going away with every minute, so if you want one that corresponds

267
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,240
to your own name, company name, or anything else, it's worth getting now before it's

268
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,240
gone.

269
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,540
Hover makes all of that super simple and quick, they help you find super unique domains with

270
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,940
their over 400 extensions, their pricing is very transparent and fair, and best of all,

271
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,660
you can get 10% off and help support this channel by going to hover.com slash wendover.

272
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,540
So, professionalize your web presence and get your domain before it's gone for 10%

273
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,500
off, once again, at hover.com slash wendover.
