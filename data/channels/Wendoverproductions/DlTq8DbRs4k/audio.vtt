00:10.960 --> 00:20.280
On Thursday, May 3rd, 1979, 31,221,362 voters gathered at polling stations across the United

00:20.280 --> 00:25.840
Kingdom to decide on who would fill the 650 seats of the House of Commons.

00:25.840 --> 00:32.240
Now, any election is important, but this one held particular significance.

00:32.240 --> 00:37.000
Over the years leading up to it, the country's manufacturing industry was collapsing, inflation

00:37.000 --> 00:41.400
was wreaking havoc on the economy, mass strikes were plaguing both the public and private

00:41.400 --> 00:46.400
sector, unemployment was exploding, and it was quickly becoming clear that Britain was

00:46.400 --> 00:53.240
losing ground to Japan, Germany, the US, and other subjects of post-war economic booms.

00:53.240 --> 00:57.720
Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party proposed a solution—they would curb the

00:57.720 --> 01:04.220
power of unions, cut personal income tax, and privatize nationalized industries—essentially,

01:04.220 --> 01:09.440
it was a complete rejection of the economic ideology of the prior 30 years.

01:09.440 --> 01:14.520
However, in the view of the British public, the status quo was what got them to the turmoil

01:14.520 --> 01:18.520
of the era, so Thatcher's message resonated.

01:18.520 --> 01:23.600
Once the ballots were counted, the Conservative Party picked up 62 new seats, bringing their

01:23.600 --> 01:30.280
total to 339, a majority, and therefore making Margaret Thatcher Prime Minister of the United

01:30.280 --> 01:31.960
Kingdom.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.080
The era of British privatization started quite quickly—first with British Petroleum, of

01:37.080 --> 01:41.520
which Thatcher began selling off shares just months following her appointment.

01:41.520 --> 01:46.360
But then, in the new decade, the trend kicks into high gear with British Aerospace, British

01:46.360 --> 01:53.000
Gas, Rolls-Royce, British Airways, British Steel, National Express, British Telecom,

01:53.000 --> 01:58.220
British Leyland, the British Airports Authority, and dozens more state-owned enterprises being

01:58.220 --> 02:00.420
sold off to the private sector.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.800
By the 1990s, the concept of a state-owned enterprise was becoming increasingly obscure,

02:05.800 --> 02:13.920
but there was just one major sector that the sell-offs had yet to really touch—the railroads.

02:13.920 --> 02:17.560
Thatcher herself didn't dare touch them.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.600
Politically, it was tricky.

02:19.600 --> 02:25.000
In the country, trains operated at a loss to many rural areas from which her party needed

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
votes.

02:26.000 --> 02:30.520
Fully privatizing the industry would mean that those areas would inevitably lose service,

02:30.520 --> 02:34.120
and the Conservative Party would inevitably lose votes.

02:34.120 --> 02:39.240
In addition, in her view, railroads were just one of the rare examples of sectors that just

02:39.240 --> 02:41.080
had to be publicly run.

02:41.080 --> 02:46.760
They were just too tricky to run both efficiently and effectively with a purely profit-seeking

02:46.760 --> 02:48.000
motive.

02:48.000 --> 02:52.640
Her reign ended, though, in 1990, after a leadership battle within her own party, and

02:52.640 --> 02:56.000
her successors weren't so cautious.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
Conveniently, in 1991, the European Union acted first.

03:01.000 --> 03:06.940
It issued directive 91-440, which read, quote, "...whereas the future development and efficient

03:06.940 --> 03:11.340
operation of the railway system may be made easier if a distinction is made between the

03:11.340 --> 03:16.900
provision of transport services and the operation of infrastructure, whereas given this situation,

03:16.900 --> 03:21.540
it is necessary for these two activities to be separately managed and have separate accounts."

03:21.540 --> 03:27.820
Essentially, what this said was that the companies, organizations, or agencies that actually operated

03:27.820 --> 03:32.800
the trains had to be legally separate entities from those that operated and owned the tracks

03:32.800 --> 03:35.100
upon which trains operated.

03:35.100 --> 03:40.180
The reasoning stemmed from the EU's wish for private rail competition against the government-run

03:40.180 --> 03:41.420
systems.

03:41.420 --> 03:45.640
They were opening the door for companies to operate rail services on any track in the

03:45.640 --> 03:49.540
European Union, as long as they paid for it.

03:49.540 --> 03:54.720
Of course, that gave the government a perfect first target for privatization.

03:54.720 --> 04:02.460
On April 1st, 1994, Railtrack came into existence—a private company that now owned all the tracks,

04:02.460 --> 04:06.000
stations, and rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.260
There was much work left to do, though—British Rail's trains went to three newly formed

04:10.260 --> 04:16.080
rolling stock companies, their telecoms infrastructure was sold to Racal Electronics, freight operations

04:16.080 --> 04:21.360
were split up and allocated to six newly formed private companies, and this process went on

04:21.360 --> 04:26.580
and on and on, but then came the question of passenger train services.

04:27.200 --> 04:34.680
It was very clear that the solution to privatizing those would not be a quick and complete sell-off.

04:34.680 --> 04:39.840
The crux of the problem was exactly what Thatcher had identified when she decided not to privatize

04:39.840 --> 04:46.840
the railways—the public had come to expect and rely on inherently loss-making rail operations.

04:46.840 --> 04:52.320
While running an 8am train from Edinburgh to London may be profitable, running a 1pm

04:52.320 --> 04:55.560
train from Manchester to Buxton probably is not.

04:55.560 --> 05:00.400
In order to run trains at the prices, to the places, and with the frequency the public

05:00.400 --> 05:06.280
demanded, someone had to at least sometimes take a loss.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.180
With that, a structure evolved.

05:09.180 --> 05:13.980
Intercity, British Rail's long-distance brand, was split into seven segments.

05:13.980 --> 05:18.140
Network South East, which primarily operated commuter services in and around London, was

05:18.140 --> 05:22.940
split into ten, while Regional Railways, which operated short-distance services throughout

05:22.940 --> 05:25.860
the rest of the country, was split into eight.

05:25.860 --> 05:31.180
These 25 train-operating companies would at first be owned and run by the government,

05:31.180 --> 05:36.260
but through time, the operations of each would be franchised out to private companies.

05:36.260 --> 05:41.180
Now, each of the train-operating companies were designed so that their advantages and

05:41.180 --> 05:45.940
disadvantages were, in the view of a private company, somewhat balanced.

05:45.940 --> 05:51.040
That's rather important, since any franchisee is contractually required to serve certain

05:51.040 --> 05:54.880
stations, at certain times, and certain frequencies.

05:54.880 --> 06:00.080
For example, the intercity East Coast franchise includes the super-high-demand, high-frequency

06:00.080 --> 06:05.140
East Coast service from Edinburgh Waverley to London Kings Cross—two of the busiest

06:05.140 --> 06:10.240
train stations in the UK, between which any operator should be able to turn a profit.

06:10.240 --> 06:15.440
However, this franchise also requires, for example, the operator to run at least one

06:15.440 --> 06:20.920
train a day that leaves London Kings Cross between 1130 AM and 1230 PM, and eventually

06:20.920 --> 06:25.900
calls at the small Scottish town of Kingoosie, along with a corresponding southbound service

06:25.900 --> 06:31.400
that calls at the town before arriving at Kings Cross between 530 and 630 PM.

06:31.400 --> 06:37.900
Now, only some 108 people use Kingoosie railway station each day—most to get on the regional

06:37.900 --> 06:41.180
trains running between Glasgow or Edinburgh and Inverness.

06:41.180 --> 06:45.140
A private company likely would not choose to service a station where they'd be lucky

06:45.140 --> 06:50.160
to pick up a dozen passengers in a day, so the intention of the franchising system was

06:50.160 --> 06:54.960
to balance things out—put a little bit of the bad with the good—so that places

06:54.960 --> 06:58.660
like Kingoosie would not lose their service.

06:58.660 --> 07:02.520
To further balance things out, the government would accept bids from companies to operate

07:02.520 --> 07:07.660
the different franchises, and what the government would receive could either be in the positive

07:07.660 --> 07:09.420
or the negative.

07:09.420 --> 07:13.540
The government would look at all the serious bids and quite simply pick the one that would

07:13.540 --> 07:18.140
make them the most money in incoming franchise payments, or lose them the least money in

07:18.140 --> 07:20.120
outgoing subsidies.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.660
On the surface, it seemed like the perfect system.

07:23.660 --> 07:29.740
The free market would force companies to compete to win a franchise, and, in the end, the government,

07:29.740 --> 07:34.960
and by extension the British taxpayer, would spend the least amount or earn the most amount

07:34.960 --> 07:36.820
of money possible.

07:36.820 --> 07:40.320
But that's just the view from the surface.

07:40.320 --> 07:44.240
If you dive in and take a deeper look at the franchise agreement—the contract between

07:44.240 --> 07:48.420
an operator and the government—cracks begin to show.

07:48.420 --> 07:53.500
This document is the draft of that agreement for the Intercity East Coast franchise—the

07:53.500 --> 07:58.480
one that includes Edinburgh to London service—published by the UK government during the latest tendering

07:58.480 --> 08:00.840
process in 2014.

08:00.840 --> 08:05.200
It begins with definitions of terms, a statement of governing law, and assorted other legal

08:05.200 --> 08:09.960
declarations, but then moves on to exactly how the relationship between a franchisee

08:09.960 --> 08:11.940
and the government will work.

08:11.940 --> 08:17.160
For example, in Schedule 1.1 Part A Section 4, it lays out the idea that franchisees cannot

08:17.160 --> 08:20.940
alter the timetable without a long, arduous process of consultation with the government

08:20.940 --> 08:23.560
and other stakeholders, including the public.

08:23.560 --> 08:27.400
Section 7 established the requirements for operators to, on average, have the capacity

08:27.400 --> 08:31.100
for anyone to find a seat immediately upon boarding and off-peak trains, and within twenty

08:31.100 --> 08:33.380
minutes of boarding for on-peak trains.

08:33.380 --> 08:37.020
Section 12 introduces the concept of breach performance levels, which, if a franchisee

08:37.020 --> 08:39.860
exceeds, will put them in breach of contract.

08:39.860 --> 08:46.180
For example, the Intercity East Coast franchisee must not exceed 0.0235 cancellations per 1,000

08:46.180 --> 08:50.200
miles or 1,600 kilometers traveled in its second year of operations, and by the end

08:50.200 --> 08:56.080
of year 10, if their franchise even lasts that long, the level must be down to 0.0119.

08:56.080 --> 08:59.960
Schedule 1.2 Part A Section 6 lays out the requirements for alternate transportation

08:59.960 --> 09:02.120
in the event of train cancellation.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.600
This section outlines the requirements for timetable publishing and poster display at

09:05.600 --> 09:06.600
stations.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.140
This one defines the operator's data reporting requirements.

09:09.140 --> 09:12.600
This one outlines the requirement for operators to accept folding bikes on all its services

09:12.600 --> 09:15.900
and full-sized bikes quote, wherever reasonably practical.

09:15.900 --> 09:20.240
This establishes the prohibition of the franchisees engaging in any business except for the operation

09:20.240 --> 09:23.680
of trains and certain auxiliary services like selling food on board.

09:23.680 --> 09:27.560
This outlines the franchisees' ban on entering into any leases without government approval,

09:27.560 --> 09:32.080
and the leases for stations, depots, and other facilities that it's required to enter into,

09:32.080 --> 09:36.400
and this section summarizes what the franchisee is legally required to help with for the operation

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
of the Queen or subsequent monarch's train.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.280
So, the government tells franchisees where they must operate, when they must operate,

09:44.280 --> 09:49.740
which trains they must operate, which facilities they must lease, the maximum amount they can

09:49.740 --> 09:55.140
charge, how long they can operate, so the question is, with very, very little ability

09:55.140 --> 10:01.140
to choose how to run their trains, where are they supposed to compete?

10:01.140 --> 10:04.020
The answer is the bidding process.

10:04.020 --> 10:09.840
That's essentially the only step in this process where free-market competitive economics

10:09.840 --> 10:15.220
come into play, but these forces pushed bidders to over-promise and under-deliver.

10:15.220 --> 10:20.080
They'd say they expected a certain number of passengers, translating to a certain amount

10:20.080 --> 10:24.800
of profit, leading to a certain hypothetical future franchise payment—the main number

10:24.800 --> 10:27.360
that the government looks at in a bid.

10:27.360 --> 10:32.120
If those passengers didn't appear as predicted, then the profit didn't come either, and

10:32.120 --> 10:36.660
the franchisee would fail to make the payments upon which it bid.

10:36.660 --> 10:41.700
This is a cycle that happened time and time and time again.

10:41.700 --> 10:47.780
GNER, owned by Sea Containers, was the first operator of the intercity East Coast franchise,

10:47.780 --> 10:52.600
before it overbid in its renewal, failed to make its payments to the government, and lost

10:52.600 --> 10:54.440
the franchise early.

10:54.440 --> 10:59.180
To replace them, the government awarded the franchise to National Express in 2007, who

10:59.180 --> 11:03.220
would operate the services under the National Express East Coast brand.

11:03.220 --> 11:08.500
However, just two years later, it emerged that they too had forecast more passengers

11:08.500 --> 11:12.940
than emerged in reality, were not able to make the payments they had bid on, and so

11:12.940 --> 11:16.760
they lost the franchise in 2009.

11:16.760 --> 11:22.140
After this experience, the government temporarily re-nationalized the railway under the operator

11:22.140 --> 11:26.660
of last resort scheme that had been set up for this exact situation.

11:26.660 --> 11:31.540
The succinctly named East Coast Company, owned and run by the government, operated the line

11:31.540 --> 11:34.980
until a new bidding process was opened in 2013.

11:34.980 --> 11:39.820
A joint venture between Stagecoach and the Virgin Group won the bid, and operated services

11:39.820 --> 11:42.820
under the Virgin Train's East Coast brand.

11:42.820 --> 11:47.860
It turned out that passenger, and therefore revenue growth, had not matched the levels

11:47.860 --> 11:52.020
they had based their bid upon, therefore they were hemorrhaging money, therefore they could

11:52.020 --> 11:57.420
not make their franchise payments to the government, therefore they lost the franchise in 2018,

11:57.420 --> 12:02.880
and once again, the government re-nationalized the line and operated services under the London

12:02.880 --> 12:05.940
Northeastern Railway brand.

12:05.940 --> 12:11.800
Throughout this nearly 25-year cycle, only one period stood out from the rest.

12:11.800 --> 12:18.560
Between November 14, 2009 and February 28, 2015, when the line was run by the government-owned

12:18.560 --> 12:24.240
East Coast Train Operating Company, things went… well.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.600
In its final full year of operation, it was tied for fourth among 23 train operating companies

12:29.600 --> 12:34.720
in terms of overall passenger satisfaction, fifth for punctuality, fourth for value for

12:34.720 --> 12:39.680
money, and, even while being one of the most popular train companies, it generated over

12:39.680 --> 12:44.280
one billion pounds in profit over the years that went straight back to the government

12:44.280 --> 12:47.480
and, by extension, the British public.

12:47.720 --> 12:53.680
Therefore, when it was announced that the franchise was to be re-privatized, many asked

12:53.680 --> 12:55.260
why.

12:55.260 --> 13:00.400
Why should the government hand over a well-run, well-liked, well-profitable company to private

13:00.400 --> 13:06.240
hands which will, at best, just take a portion of those profits away from the British government

13:06.240 --> 13:07.500
and people?

13:07.500 --> 13:12.420
Over the following years, this and other related questions, doubting the merits of this almost

13:12.420 --> 13:17.160
entirely unique franchise model, grew louder and louder.

13:17.160 --> 13:22.880
By the start of 2020, an increasing number of railways stopped operating under the franchising

13:22.880 --> 13:23.880
model.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.160
Instead, they were run as concessions, where the government contracts a company to operate

13:27.160 --> 13:31.720
trains while taking the financial risk themselves, open access operators, where private companies

13:31.720 --> 13:35.680
simply pay for track access, typically on the most lucrative routes, without any additional

13:35.680 --> 13:40.120
agreement with the government, or the operator of last resort model, such as with the East

13:40.120 --> 13:43.840
Coast franchise, where the line is re-nationalized and government-run.

13:44.800 --> 13:50.380
Simultaneously, it was getting tougher and tougher to find new, reputable bidders for

13:50.380 --> 13:52.920
franchises up for renewal.

13:52.920 --> 13:56.520
Many were extended through direct award, where the government skips the competitive bidding

13:56.520 --> 14:01.360
process, which goes against the original vision of rail franchising.

14:01.360 --> 14:06.560
All around, the viability of the franchising model was coming more and more into question

14:06.560 --> 14:11.720
both domestically and internationally, where complete rail privatization was something

14:11.720 --> 14:16.560
few countries had even considered, let alone implemented.

14:16.560 --> 14:24.160
Like with so many things, though, March, 2020 dealt a death blow to the United Kingdom's

14:24.160 --> 14:26.240
privatized railroads.

14:26.240 --> 14:31.120
With the onset of stay-at-home orders in Britain, passenger numbers fell through the floor,

14:31.120 --> 14:37.420
and it became very clear, very quickly, that no franchisee would be able to fulfill their

14:37.420 --> 14:40.240
obligations to the government.

14:40.240 --> 14:46.800
Therefore, after years, even decades of debate on whether the railroads should be re-nationalized,

14:46.800 --> 14:49.920
it just happened… in a day.

14:49.920 --> 14:54.320
Secretary of State for Transport Grant Schnapps issued a letter to Parliament stating that

14:54.320 --> 14:59.120
all franchises would immediately be shifted to a concession model.

14:59.120 --> 15:03.940
The government would pay all their costs, plus a small management fee equal to no more

15:03.940 --> 15:08.960
than 2% of the company's costs in the year leading up to the pandemic.

15:08.960 --> 15:15.160
For any definition, even if private companies were operating the trains, this was a nationalized

15:15.160 --> 15:16.160
railway.

15:16.160 --> 15:21.880
Originally, this was to go on only for six months, just as a temporary measure, but in

15:21.880 --> 15:28.360
the final days of that period, on September 21st, another announcement was made.

15:28.360 --> 15:35.680
After 24 years, rail franchising, as an operating model, was done.

15:35.680 --> 15:36.920
Forever.

15:36.920 --> 15:42.400
Now, as of yet, it's not known exactly how the country's railways will operate once

15:42.400 --> 15:45.700
the provisional recovery measures lapse.

15:45.700 --> 15:50.440
The most we know comes from the Transport Secretary, who said in the initial announcement,

15:50.440 --> 15:55.880
"...the model of privatization adopted 25 years ago has seen significant rises in passenger

15:55.880 --> 16:00.840
numbers, but this pandemic has proven that it is no longer working.

16:00.840 --> 16:04.160
Our new deal for rail demands more for passengers.

16:04.160 --> 16:09.240
It will simplify people's journeys, ending the uncertainty and confusion about whether

16:09.240 --> 16:12.080
you're using the right ticket or the right train company.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.800
It will keep the best elements of the private sector, including competition and investment,

16:16.800 --> 16:23.120
that have helped to drive growth, but deliver strategic direction, leadership, and accountability.

16:23.120 --> 16:28.520
Passengers will have reliable, safe services on a network totally built around them.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.520
It's time to get Britain back on track."

16:33.040 --> 16:38.960
Now, there has always been and will always be debate on whether the privatizations of

16:38.960 --> 16:41.380
the UK's railways was a failure.

16:41.380 --> 16:45.640
It brought the highest number of passengers onto the rails in the country's history,

16:45.640 --> 16:50.320
higher even than during the golden age of rail transport in the early 1900s, but it

16:50.320 --> 16:55.360
also brought, by most measures, some of the highest fares in all of Europe.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.080
It increased the public satisfaction in the railroads and brought it to one of the highest

16:59.080 --> 17:04.060
levels in Europe, but counterintuitively, it also pulled the government's rail subsidy

17:04.060 --> 17:06.760
up to its highest level in history.

17:06.760 --> 17:11.760
Quite decisively, after privatization, the decline of the UK's rail industry turned

17:11.760 --> 17:16.640
around for the better, but what's not clear is how much of that can be attributed to the

17:16.640 --> 17:23.040
privatization itself, rather than the increased focus that privatization brought to the rails.

17:23.040 --> 17:28.080
What is clear, though, is that the experiment itself failed in proving the resilience of

17:28.080 --> 17:30.200
the franchising model.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.960
Despite positive public sentiment about the railways as a whole, an overwhelming majority

17:34.960 --> 17:37.160
of the British public supported re-nationalization.

17:37.160 --> 17:43.840
Therefore, it did not start a domino effect of rail privatization across Europe and the

17:43.840 --> 17:49.520
world, it did not convince the general public in its merits, and it proved, most of all,

17:49.520 --> 17:54.600
that the model was fundamentally flawed as it only worked in the best of times, and the

17:54.600 --> 17:58.280
worst of times will always eventually come.

17:58.280 --> 18:03.320
While the privatization and deregulation of the air transport industry, for example, rail's

18:03.320 --> 18:08.360
most direct competitor, is almost universally viewed as a success that brought lower fares

18:08.360 --> 18:13.620
and industry growth to the point that state-owned airlines are now largely a relic of antiquity,

18:13.620 --> 18:16.360
the same cannot be said for rail.

18:16.360 --> 18:23.760
No country has really cracked the nut of fully-privatized passenger train service in the 21st century.

18:23.760 --> 18:28.080
While many have taken half measures such as privatizing freight, the rails, awarding

18:28.080 --> 18:32.560
concessions to private operators betaking on the financial risk like the UK now does,

18:32.560 --> 18:37.380
or even doing as the UK did before and effectively fully privatizing railways, none have landed

18:37.380 --> 18:43.080
on a privatization model successful enough for other countries to replicate it en masse.

18:43.080 --> 18:49.140
So, even if the UK's privatization experiment accomplished some of its goals, it failed

18:49.140 --> 18:51.060
on the most elusive one.

18:51.060 --> 18:56.580
It failed to convince the UK public and the world that the privatization of railroads

18:56.580 --> 19:03.380
was the best path forward for passenger train travel in the 21st century.

19:03.380 --> 19:08.340
What the past year has proven time and time again is just how important digital presence

19:08.340 --> 19:09.660
is.

19:09.660 --> 19:14.500
Having a nice, clean, digital presence is getting to be almost as important as having

19:14.500 --> 19:17.340
a nice, clean, physical presence.

19:17.340 --> 19:21.540
Whether you're still in school, or in the big scary world of employment, this still

19:21.540 --> 19:26.520
applies, and one of the quickest and easiest ways to improve your digital presence is with

19:26.520 --> 19:28.900
a custom domain from Hover.

19:28.900 --> 19:33.300
Even if you don't want to build a website just yet, it's worth getting one for three

19:33.300 --> 19:34.660
main reasons.

19:34.660 --> 19:39.300
First, you can direct it to your LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, or any other page, so when

19:39.300 --> 19:42.340
you share those with someone, it's just one simple link.

19:42.340 --> 19:46.720
Second, you can set up a custom email address at that domain, which just looks and feels

19:46.720 --> 19:51.720
so much more professional than one ending in at Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud, or something else.

19:51.720 --> 19:56.020
And third, domains are going away with every minute, so if you want one that corresponds

19:56.020 --> 20:01.240
to your own name, company name, or anything else, it's worth getting now before it's

20:01.240 --> 20:02.240
gone.

20:02.240 --> 20:06.540
Hover makes all of that super simple and quick, they help you find super unique domains with

20:06.540 --> 20:11.940
their over 400 extensions, their pricing is very transparent and fair, and best of all,

20:11.940 --> 20:17.660
you can get 10% off and help support this channel by going to hover.com slash wendover.

20:17.660 --> 20:22.540
So, professionalize your web presence and get your domain before it's gone for 10%

20:22.540 --> 20:26.500
off, once again, at hover.com slash wendover.
