10800	15080	This is the two-page document that changed the world.
15080	19900	It's what's referred to as a notification to the World Trade Organization Committee
19900	25040	on Technical Barriers to Trade—a type of document that, to anyone in the know, is thoroughly
25040	26040	mundane.
26920	32960	In fact, every few hours another such notification enters the WTO system, each signifying that
32960	37600	yet another country wants to make yet another change to its rules regarding the import or
37600	40680	export of goods or services.
40680	47960	This particular notification, though, submitted on July 18th, 2017, managed to send the entire
47960	55120	global recycling industry into a tailspin—or possibly even a death spiral.
55120	61560	But simply, this document broke the world's recycling system.
61560	63760	But here's how it worked before this document.
63760	68700	Let's say a woman in Littleton, Colorado has yogurt for breakfast.
68700	74480	The yogurt is packaged in a thin polypropylene plastic container and so, once finished, she
74480	77780	disposes of it into her recycling bin.
77780	81960	This is then picked up by a recycling truck a few days later and brought here to the local
81960	85280	recycling company's Materials Recovery Facility.
85280	89660	There, this yogurt container, along with all the rest of the single-stream recycling picked
89660	94840	up that day, is dumped out and placed into this semi-automated sorting system.
94840	99360	Some products are simple to isolate—most metals, for example, can be picked up by magnets
99360	103240	while paper and cardboard can be easily sorted by density as they're typically lighter
103240	104720	than other recyclables.
104720	109520	Glass, plastics, and non-magnetic metals are a little more difficult to sort, but each
109520	114220	looks quite distinct, so optical scanners operate blowers or other diversion tools that
114220	116580	are able to sort these out.
116580	122300	With a few more steps, the facility is more or less left with just plastic, but that's
122300	124900	where things get difficult.
124900	129840	Plastic comes in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and types, and different shapes, sizes, or
129840	133320	types of plastic are recycled in different ways.
133320	137540	Optical sensors start out by at least accomplishing a high-level sort, though.
137560	142900	For example, in many US states, plastic bottles are sold with a five or ten cent deposit,
142900	147580	meaning that recycling companies put a lot of effort into recovering those from the mix,
147580	151660	as they can be sold for, at least relative to the other plastics, a lot.
151660	156060	They also put a lot of work into recovering certain plastic types, such as high-density
156060	160460	polyethylene, as this both sells for more and is easier to sort out of the mix since
160460	164580	it's typically used to make larger items like plastic crates, shampoo bottles, and
164580	167260	other products where sturdiness matters.
167260	171740	The polyethylene and other higher-value plastics are quite accurately sorted and then melted
171740	176380	down into bulk raw plastic which is resold to manufacturers.
176380	181420	Certain other plastics, though, have a negative value—they can't be sold, and in fact,
181420	185840	it would take so much work to turn them into usable raw material that recycling companies
185840	188920	would have to pay someone to take it off their hands.
188920	193680	Typically falling into this category are smaller items like bottle caps, plastic bags, and
193720	198340	other scraps below three inches or eight centimeters in width that just can't be easily sorted
198340	200320	by automated systems.
200320	204600	These are then aggregated together and, at best, used to generate electricity through
204600	208920	incineration or, at worst, are just sent to a landfill.
208920	213800	So, to summarize, there's high-value plastic that's recovered immediately, negative-value
213800	217740	plastic that's either incinerated or sent to a landfill, and then there's a third
217740	223040	category in between those two, and that's where things get interesting.
223400	228380	Anything that isn't small and unrecoverable or large and valuable is typically mixed together
228380	235120	and formed into big bales of unsorted, medium-size, medium-value plastic that effectively have
235120	237880	a neutral value on the free market.
237880	243520	The raw materials in these bales, known as MRF residuals, is not quite valuable enough
243520	247780	to pay for the sorting process they would need for recycling, which leads to their neutral
247780	251600	value—at least, in the US.
251600	255680	Whenever it takes its trip through the Materials Recovery Facility, that yogurt container from
255680	262340	Littleton, Colorado would, if properly sorted, end up in one of these MRF residual bales.
262340	268120	These are then loaded into the back of a semi-truck driven 1,000 miles to the port of Long Beach,
268120	269120	California.
269120	274040	There, the bales are officially exported from the US, loaded into a shipping container,
274040	279360	and placed on an enormous, yet empty, Hong Kong-bound cargo ship.
279360	286700	Now, with this knowledge, some might ask a question—how on earth did we end up with
286700	292160	this system, theoretically designed to reduce our impact on the world, where our waste is
292160	294720	shipped across the world?
294720	299640	To that, there's actually a surprisingly specific answer.
299640	306080	Decades ago, in 1969, the first national conference on packaging waste convened, and in that room
306080	309240	were a number of plastics industry executives.
309240	313440	Throughout that event, they heard municipal leaders from around the country express their
313440	317760	concern about just how permanent plastic was.
317760	322420	Back then, the material was becoming cheaper and cheaper and was quickly gaining prominence
322420	327660	in the packaging world, but this mounting concern among municipal leaders itself led
327660	331400	to mounting concern among plastics executives.
331400	337400	They came to believe that this plastic hesitancy would quickly become an existential threat
337400	342160	for the industry's growth, so plastics knew they needed a solution.
342160	346360	They needed a way to make plastic sustainable.
346360	347620	The problem?
347620	349040	There wasn't one.
349040	351120	So, backup option.
351120	356920	Rather than creating a real solution, they willfully and knowingly created and propagated
356920	362880	a system that didn't work, but looked like a solution—recycling.
362880	368420	From a technical standpoint, you can sort, melt down, and reuse plastic, thereby reducing
368420	372920	its impact on the world, but that's not why it doesn't work.
372920	377840	From a social perspective, people do often do their part and, at least somewhat, separate
377840	382560	their trash from recycling, but that's also not why it doesn't work.
382560	388160	Why recycling doesn't work is because, overall, it's not profitable.
388160	394780	It's very simple—oil is cheap, at least now, and when oil is cheap, making new plastic
394780	395780	is cheap.
395780	401560	Meanwhile, sorting, transporting, and melting down existing plastic is expensive.
401560	410360	In 2017, virgin PET plastic cost about $0.54 per pound, while recycled PET cost about $0.63
410360	414280	per pound and was lower quality than the alternative.
414280	419440	Therefore, demand for recycled PET was low, so waste management companies couldn't turn
419440	425000	a profit turning used PET into raw, recycled PET at scale.
425000	429560	When companies can't make a profit recycling, it doesn't happen—or, at least not at
429560	432800	the rates needed to make the plastics industry sustainable.
432800	437560	For the plastics industry, though, all they needed was the perception of sustainability
437560	443960	and, even though a big chunk of what went into a recycling bin ended up not recycled,
443960	448600	consumers and municipal leaders were happy because they believed that the plastic they
448600	450600	consumed was guilt-free.
450600	456920	That's how that yogurt container tossed in Littleton, Colorado ended up on a boat
456920	458480	to Hong Kong.
458480	465240	Now, the rule just mentioned is still valid—plastic is only recycled when it's profitable—but
465240	472880	for a brief moment in time, it was, all thanks to a trifecta of economic conditions in China.
472880	476600	First, shipping was incredibly cheap.
476600	482840	Western nations like the US have long had a significant trade deficit with China—essentially,
482840	487020	America buys far more from China than China does from America.
487020	491840	That means that cargo ships from Greater China travel to the US almost completely full, but
491840	497520	then return with plenty of extra capacity, meaning shipping rates to China are far lower
497520	500200	than shipping rates from China.
500200	505280	Thanks to that, you could get one of those MRF residual bales across the Pacific for
505280	507360	next to nothing.
507360	512720	In addition to this, since the 1980s, China has been riding its way through an unprecedented
512720	515160	phase of economic growth.
515160	519620	This was so dramatic that the company's industries literally could not find enough
519620	523660	raw materials, including plastic, to fulfill their demand.
523660	529140	Therefore, with constrained supply and high demand, even recycled plastic prices went
529140	533900	up, giving the recyclers in the country more room to cover costs.
533900	539900	In addition, especially in more rural areas, wages were low in China.
539900	544740	Those MRF residual bales are composed of those difficult-to-sort plastics, but humans can
544740	550420	sort just about anything profitably, as long as their wages are low enough.
550420	555740	So, all in all, considering shipping to China was effectively free, and raw materials were
555740	561780	higher, and wages were low, the equation just happened to work out that in the late 90s,
561780	569820	2000s, and early 2010s, sorting and recycling MRF residual bales in China was just ever-so-slightly
569820	570820	profitable.
570900	576500	That's why, upon arrival into Hong Kong, the plastic yogurt container disposed of in
576500	581380	Lyttelton, along with everything else in these bales, is immediately transferred onto a smaller
581380	586260	barge and re-exported out of Hong Kong for a short journey across the Pearl River Delta
586260	589180	to the Guangdong province in mainland China.
589180	596460	Then, after an 8,000 mile, 13,000 kilometer journey to the other side of the world, it
596460	599520	ends up at its final destination.
599520	604240	The Wellpine Plastic Industrial Company, just outside Guangzhou.
604240	609380	There, the bales are unloaded, spread out, and low-wage workers manually sift through
609380	614080	the contents, eventually finding that yogurt container and putting it in a pile along with
614080	617080	the rest of the polypropylene plastics.
617080	621820	From there, the polypropylenes are melted down, purified, and reformed into pallets
621820	627520	which then, eventually, are sold in bulk to another manufacturer, somewhere else in China,
627520	630840	for a very, very slight profit.
630840	637040	Now, this whole system, of taking effectively valueless MRF residual bales and shipping
637040	642800	them across the world to a place where they did have a very slight positive value, worked.
642800	648980	It was intelligent, it wasn't clean, but it worked, and that's how, for a few decades,
648980	652900	the Western World Recycling System functioned.
652900	657880	The most valuable stuff was sorted and sold domestically, the valueless stuff was exported
657880	663500	to where it had value in China, and the stuff with a negative value was sent to the landfill
663500	665760	or incinerated.
665760	668820	But then came that document.
668820	674540	The notification to the World Trade Organization Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.
674540	681580	All this said was that China would, starting at the end of 2017, ban the import of 24 products
681580	687860	covered under these HS codes—the numerical classifications used to simplify international
687860	689300	trade.
689300	694520	These particular five, though, were the ones that created this big problem for the plastics
694520	695520	industry.
695520	701220	They translate to waste, pairings, and other scrap of polymers of ethylene, of polymers
701220	706820	of styrene, of polymers of vinyl chloride, of polyethylene glycol terephthalate, and
706820	710020	other waste, pairings, and scraps of plastics.
710020	717200	Effectively, by banning these five HS codes, they banned the import of almost all plastic
717200	718700	waste.
718700	727820	As a result, the country's 2018 plastic import volume dropped 99.1% compared to 2017—this
727820	732620	massive, global industry quite literally ended overnight.
732620	739220	Now, while the true reasoning behind any Chinese government decision is always elusive, at
739220	744000	least according to this document, it was that the import of these products was creating
744000	747940	a serious environmental and public health problem.
747940	750180	This is likely true.
750180	756400	As MRF residual bales are, by their very nature, unsorted, they often included hazardous materials
756400	761900	that could seriously harm those sorting them, and this went on to cost the government since
761900	764900	the government runs much of the country's healthcare system.
765160	770340	In addition, the sorting facilities in China would often illegally dump the portion of
770340	775100	the plastics that even they couldn't profitably recover, creating an environmental problem
775100	778220	that the government had to pay to clean up.
778220	783180	Therefore, while the private companies that actually sorted and processed these MRF residual
783180	791220	bales turned a slight profit, China as a nation was losing money by processing the world's
791220	792220	trash.
792220	797220	So, essentially, even though it looked like plastic recycling was profitable, once the
797220	803560	externalities were priced in, it once again became clear that plastic recycling was not,
803560	805540	in fact, a viable system.
805540	810900	That's why China issued this document, that's why they banned plastic waste import, and
810900	814380	that's why the world's recycling system broke.
814380	820060	Nowadays, when a woman in Littleton, Colorado throws her yogurt container into the recycling
820060	824700	bin, the journey that ensues is often far, far shorter.
824700	830580	First, as before, it's picked up by a truck, brought to a materials recovery facility,
830580	835700	sorted down, and packed into one of those MRF residual bales, but after, there are now
835700	838300	three main options.
838300	843520	The first is that it's exported, as before, but not to China.
843520	849180	In response to the import ban, Malaysia tripled their plastic import volume between 2017 and
849180	854720	2018, becoming the largest processor in the world, and some other nearby low-wage countries
854720	856220	ramped up as well.
856220	862360	Eventually, though, these countries will undoubtedly realize what China did—processing MRF residual
862360	867240	bales may be profitable to a company, but not to a country.
867240	872700	The amount of health and environmental issues it creates in the long run costs more than
872700	875020	the industry makes.
875020	880540	Even despite the alternate plastic export options, the US's export volume, which includes
880540	887960	more than just MRF residual bales, still dropped by a third between 2017 and 2018.
887960	893180	There was just no one who would take these bales, even for free, since with the removal
893180	898180	of China from the market, very few companies could turn a profit processing them, even
898180	899940	outside the US.
899940	905620	The global value of one of these bales went from slightly positive to clearly negative,
905620	909580	and remember, recycling only works when it's profitable.
909580	915940	Therefore, with far fewer buyers, MRF residual bales piled up and up until eventually, the
915940	921740	waste processors gave up and put them into the same category as bottle caps, scraps,
921740	927100	and those other small, unrecoverable, unprofitable pieces of plastic.
927100	932420	Now, when you put something into one of those big blue bins that are supposed to lead to
932420	938780	a second life for your waste, it ends up, more often than not, in the incinerator or
938780	940500	landfill.
940500	946300	Plastic recycling, with the exception of those few highest value items, is now definitively
946300	948520	broken.
948520	951900	But here's the thing—it was always broken.
951900	957460	Plastic recycling, with limited exception, never generated more money than it cost, and
957460	960780	so it was never economically sustainable.
960780	965740	The China system was just a blip, thanks to a unique set of economic circumstances and
965740	970340	a government that didn't yet recognize the cost of the industry's externalities.
970340	975520	That puts the plastics industry back where it was in 1969—people are starting to realize
975520	978740	that there is no way to make plastic sustainable.
978740	983660	There are some half-solutions—some scientists are working to develop an enzyme that can
983660	987940	eat plastic in a matter of days, and others are trying, using chemical processes to break
987940	993740	it down into its raw components, but the recycling problem is not a technical one.
993740	998180	Actually performing the process of taking what's disposed of by consumers, sorting
998180	1001980	it, and melting it down into new raw materials is easy.
1001980	1004760	What's not is the economics.
1004760	1010260	The recycling problem is an economic one, and you can only solve economic issues with
1010260	1012160	economics.
1012160	1018380	The true solution is simple—either the cost of recycling has to come down, or the price
1018380	1021200	of raw recycled plastic has to go up.
1021200	1026940	What's going to fix recycling is when it generates more money than it costs, but making
1026940	1030480	that happen will take quite a lot.
1030480	1035800	If enough consumers, for example, buy products that use recycled plastic, rather than a direct
1035800	1041080	alternative that uses the virgin variant, market forces will work out in a way that,
1041080	1045900	eventually, once critical mass is attained, what companies lose from customers choosing
1045900	1050600	more sustainable alternatives is more than what they lose from paying to swap to more
1050600	1054200	expensive, lower quality recycled plastic.
1054920	1060960	Plastics recycling, as a system, was never created to make the world a better place.
1060960	1066720	Rather, it was created by the plastics industry to plug a hole in their system.
1066720	1072000	It was created to propagate a false belief that consumption could be sustainable, so
1072000	1078120	the only way to stop plastic from overwhelming our oceans, polluting our land, and making
1078120	1085720	the world a worse place to live in, is to shut the system, the entire system, down.
1085720	1092940	So, I get a lot of emails—from potential sponsors, companies that want my business,
1092940	1094380	and other professionals.
1094380	1099760	I can tell you from personal experience that the biggest red flag for me in cold-call emails
1099760	1105320	is when the address ends in Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, or another generic provider's domain.
1105520	1109320	Anyone could create that email in a few seconds, so I have no idea if the person is who they
1109320	1110640	say they are.
1110640	1116480	Simply put, if you don't have a professional-looking email address, people won't think you're
1116480	1117480	professional.
1117480	1120920	Whether you're running a small business, going through school, or doing anything else
