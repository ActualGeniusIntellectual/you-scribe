4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,080
This is the two-page document that changed the world.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,900
It's what's referred to as a notification to the World Trade Organization Committee

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,040
on Technical Barriers to Trade—a type of document that, to anyone in the know, is thoroughly

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,040
mundane.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,960
In fact, every few hours another such notification enters the WTO system, each signifying that

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
yet another country wants to make yet another change to its rules regarding the import or

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,680
export of goods or services.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,960
This particular notification, though, submitted on July 18th, 2017, managed to send the entire

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,120
global recycling industry into a tailspin—or possibly even a death spiral.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,560
But simply, this document broke the world's recycling system.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,760
But here's how it worked before this document.

15
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,700
Let's say a woman in Littleton, Colorado has yogurt for breakfast.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,480
The yogurt is packaged in a thin polypropylene plastic container and so, once finished, she

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,780
disposes of it into her recycling bin.

18
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,960
This is then picked up by a recycling truck a few days later and brought here to the local

19
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,280
recycling company's Materials Recovery Facility.

20
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,660
There, this yogurt container, along with all the rest of the single-stream recycling picked

21
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,840
up that day, is dumped out and placed into this semi-automated sorting system.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,360
Some products are simple to isolate—most metals, for example, can be picked up by magnets

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,240
while paper and cardboard can be easily sorted by density as they're typically lighter

24
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,720
than other recyclables.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,520
Glass, plastics, and non-magnetic metals are a little more difficult to sort, but each

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,220
looks quite distinct, so optical scanners operate blowers or other diversion tools that

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:56,580
are able to sort these out.

28
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,300
With a few more steps, the facility is more or less left with just plastic, but that's

29
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,900
where things get difficult.

30
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,840
Plastic comes in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and types, and different shapes, sizes, or

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,320
types of plastic are recycled in different ways.

32
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,540
Optical sensors start out by at least accomplishing a high-level sort, though.

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,900
For example, in many US states, plastic bottles are sold with a five or ten cent deposit,

34
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,580
meaning that recycling companies put a lot of effort into recovering those from the mix,

35
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,660
as they can be sold for, at least relative to the other plastics, a lot.

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,060
They also put a lot of work into recovering certain plastic types, such as high-density

37
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,460
polyethylene, as this both sells for more and is easier to sort out of the mix since

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,580
it's typically used to make larger items like plastic crates, shampoo bottles, and

39
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,260
other products where sturdiness matters.

40
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,740
The polyethylene and other higher-value plastics are quite accurately sorted and then melted

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,380
down into bulk raw plastic which is resold to manufacturers.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,420
Certain other plastics, though, have a negative value—they can't be sold, and in fact,

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,840
it would take so much work to turn them into usable raw material that recycling companies

44
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,920
would have to pay someone to take it off their hands.

45
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,680
Typically falling into this category are smaller items like bottle caps, plastic bags, and

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,340
other scraps below three inches or eight centimeters in width that just can't be easily sorted

47
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,320
by automated systems.

48
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,600
These are then aggregated together and, at best, used to generate electricity through

49
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,920
incineration or, at worst, are just sent to a landfill.

50
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,800
So, to summarize, there's high-value plastic that's recovered immediately, negative-value

51
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,740
plastic that's either incinerated or sent to a landfill, and then there's a third

52
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:43,040
category in between those two, and that's where things get interesting.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,380
Anything that isn't small and unrecoverable or large and valuable is typically mixed together

54
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:55,120
and formed into big bales of unsorted, medium-size, medium-value plastic that effectively have

55
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,880
a neutral value on the free market.

56
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,520
The raw materials in these bales, known as MRF residuals, is not quite valuable enough

57
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,780
to pay for the sorting process they would need for recycling, which leads to their neutral

58
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,600
value—at least, in the US.

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,680
Whenever it takes its trip through the Materials Recovery Facility, that yogurt container from

60
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,340
Littleton, Colorado would, if properly sorted, end up in one of these MRF residual bales.

61
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:28,120
These are then loaded into the back of a semi-truck driven 1,000 miles to the port of Long Beach,

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
California.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,040
There, the bales are officially exported from the US, loaded into a shipping container,

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,360
and placed on an enormous, yet empty, Hong Kong-bound cargo ship.

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,700
Now, with this knowledge, some might ask a question—how on earth did we end up with

66
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,160
this system, theoretically designed to reduce our impact on the world, where our waste is

67
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,720
shipped across the world?

68
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,640
To that, there's actually a surprisingly specific answer.

69
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:06,080
Decades ago, in 1969, the first national conference on packaging waste convened, and in that room

70
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,240
were a number of plastics industry executives.

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,440
Throughout that event, they heard municipal leaders from around the country express their

72
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,760
concern about just how permanent plastic was.

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,420
Back then, the material was becoming cheaper and cheaper and was quickly gaining prominence

74
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,660
in the packaging world, but this mounting concern among municipal leaders itself led

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,400
to mounting concern among plastics executives.

76
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,400
They came to believe that this plastic hesitancy would quickly become an existential threat

77
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,160
for the industry's growth, so plastics knew they needed a solution.

78
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,360
They needed a way to make plastic sustainable.

79
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,620
The problem?

80
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,040
There wasn't one.

81
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,120
So, backup option.

82
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,920
Rather than creating a real solution, they willfully and knowingly created and propagated

83
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,880
a system that didn't work, but looked like a solution—recycling.

84
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,420
From a technical standpoint, you can sort, melt down, and reuse plastic, thereby reducing

85
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,920
its impact on the world, but that's not why it doesn't work.

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,840
From a social perspective, people do often do their part and, at least somewhat, separate

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,560
their trash from recycling, but that's also not why it doesn't work.

88
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,160
Why recycling doesn't work is because, overall, it's not profitable.

89
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,780
It's very simple—oil is cheap, at least now, and when oil is cheap, making new plastic

90
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
is cheap.

91
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,560
Meanwhile, sorting, transporting, and melting down existing plastic is expensive.

92
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:50,360
In 2017, virgin PET plastic cost about $0.54 per pound, while recycled PET cost about $0.63

93
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,280
per pound and was lower quality than the alternative.

94
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,440
Therefore, demand for recycled PET was low, so waste management companies couldn't turn

95
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,000
a profit turning used PET into raw, recycled PET at scale.

96
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,560
When companies can't make a profit recycling, it doesn't happen—or, at least not at

97
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,800
the rates needed to make the plastics industry sustainable.

98
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,560
For the plastics industry, though, all they needed was the perception of sustainability

99
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,960
and, even though a big chunk of what went into a recycling bin ended up not recycled,

100
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,600
consumers and municipal leaders were happy because they believed that the plastic they

101
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
consumed was guilt-free.

102
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:36,920
That's how that yogurt container tossed in Littleton, Colorado ended up on a boat

103
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,480
to Hong Kong.

104
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:45,240
Now, the rule just mentioned is still valid—plastic is only recycled when it's profitable—but

105
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,880
for a brief moment in time, it was, all thanks to a trifecta of economic conditions in China.

106
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,600
First, shipping was incredibly cheap.

107
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,840
Western nations like the US have long had a significant trade deficit with China—essentially,

108
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,020
America buys far more from China than China does from America.

109
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,840
That means that cargo ships from Greater China travel to the US almost completely full, but

110
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,520
then return with plenty of extra capacity, meaning shipping rates to China are far lower

111
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,200
than shipping rates from China.

112
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,280
Thanks to that, you could get one of those MRF residual bales across the Pacific for

113
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,360
next to nothing.

114
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,720
In addition to this, since the 1980s, China has been riding its way through an unprecedented

115
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,160
phase of economic growth.

116
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,620
This was so dramatic that the company's industries literally could not find enough

117
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,660
raw materials, including plastic, to fulfill their demand.

118
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:49,140
Therefore, with constrained supply and high demand, even recycled plastic prices went

119
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,900
up, giving the recyclers in the country more room to cover costs.

120
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,900
In addition, especially in more rural areas, wages were low in China.

121
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,740
Those MRF residual bales are composed of those difficult-to-sort plastics, but humans can

122
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,420
sort just about anything profitably, as long as their wages are low enough.

123
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,740
So, all in all, considering shipping to China was effectively free, and raw materials were

124
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,780
higher, and wages were low, the equation just happened to work out that in the late 90s,

125
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:29,820
2000s, and early 2010s, sorting and recycling MRF residual bales in China was just ever-so-slightly

126
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,820
profitable.

127
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,500
That's why, upon arrival into Hong Kong, the plastic yogurt container disposed of in

128
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,380
Lyttelton, along with everything else in these bales, is immediately transferred onto a smaller

129
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,260
barge and re-exported out of Hong Kong for a short journey across the Pearl River Delta

130
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,180
to the Guangdong province in mainland China.

131
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:56,460
Then, after an 8,000 mile, 13,000 kilometer journey to the other side of the world, it

132
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,520
ends up at its final destination.

133
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,240
The Wellpine Plastic Industrial Company, just outside Guangzhou.

134
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,380
There, the bales are unloaded, spread out, and low-wage workers manually sift through

135
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,080
the contents, eventually finding that yogurt container and putting it in a pile along with

136
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,080
the rest of the polypropylene plastics.

137
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:21,820
From there, the polypropylenes are melted down, purified, and reformed into pallets

138
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,520
which then, eventually, are sold in bulk to another manufacturer, somewhere else in China,

139
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,840
for a very, very slight profit.

140
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,040
Now, this whole system, of taking effectively valueless MRF residual bales and shipping

141
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,800
them across the world to a place where they did have a very slight positive value, worked.

142
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,980
It was intelligent, it wasn't clean, but it worked, and that's how, for a few decades,

143
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,900
the Western World Recycling System functioned.

144
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,880
The most valuable stuff was sorted and sold domestically, the valueless stuff was exported

145
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,500
to where it had value in China, and the stuff with a negative value was sent to the landfill

146
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,760
or incinerated.

147
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,820
But then came that document.

148
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,540
The notification to the World Trade Organization Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.

149
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:21,580
All this said was that China would, starting at the end of 2017, ban the import of 24 products

150
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,860
covered under these HS codes—the numerical classifications used to simplify international

151
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,300
trade.

152
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,520
These particular five, though, were the ones that created this big problem for the plastics

153
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,520
industry.

154
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,220
They translate to waste, pairings, and other scrap of polymers of ethylene, of polymers

155
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,820
of styrene, of polymers of vinyl chloride, of polyethylene glycol terephthalate, and

156
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,020
other waste, pairings, and scraps of plastics.

157
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:57,200
Effectively, by banning these five HS codes, they banned the import of almost all plastic

158
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,700
waste.

159
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:07,820
As a result, the country's 2018 plastic import volume dropped 99.1% compared to 2017—this

160
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,620
massive, global industry quite literally ended overnight.

161
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,220
Now, while the true reasoning behind any Chinese government decision is always elusive, at

162
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,000
least according to this document, it was that the import of these products was creating

163
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,940
a serious environmental and public health problem.

164
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,180
This is likely true.

165
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,400
As MRF residual bales are, by their very nature, unsorted, they often included hazardous materials

166
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,900
that could seriously harm those sorting them, and this went on to cost the government since

167
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,900
the government runs much of the country's healthcare system.

168
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,340
In addition, the sorting facilities in China would often illegally dump the portion of

169
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,100
the plastics that even they couldn't profitably recover, creating an environmental problem

170
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,220
that the government had to pay to clean up.

171
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,180
Therefore, while the private companies that actually sorted and processed these MRF residual

172
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:11,220
bales turned a slight profit, China as a nation was losing money by processing the world's

173
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,220
trash.

174
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,220
So, essentially, even though it looked like plastic recycling was profitable, once the

175
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,560
externalities were priced in, it once again became clear that plastic recycling was not,

176
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,540
in fact, a viable system.

177
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,900
That's why China issued this document, that's why they banned plastic waste import, and

178
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,380
that's why the world's recycling system broke.

179
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,060
Nowadays, when a woman in Littleton, Colorado throws her yogurt container into the recycling

180
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,700
bin, the journey that ensues is often far, far shorter.

181
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,580
First, as before, it's picked up by a truck, brought to a materials recovery facility,

182
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,700
sorted down, and packed into one of those MRF residual bales, but after, there are now

183
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,300
three main options.

184
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,520
The first is that it's exported, as before, but not to China.

185
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,180
In response to the import ban, Malaysia tripled their plastic import volume between 2017 and

186
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:14,720
2018, becoming the largest processor in the world, and some other nearby low-wage countries

187
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,220
ramped up as well.

188
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,360
Eventually, though, these countries will undoubtedly realize what China did—processing MRF residual

189
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,240
bales may be profitable to a company, but not to a country.

190
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:32,700
The amount of health and environmental issues it creates in the long run costs more than

191
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,020
the industry makes.

192
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,540
Even despite the alternate plastic export options, the US's export volume, which includes

193
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:47,960
more than just MRF residual bales, still dropped by a third between 2017 and 2018.

194
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,180
There was just no one who would take these bales, even for free, since with the removal

195
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:58,180
of China from the market, very few companies could turn a profit processing them, even

196
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,940
outside the US.

197
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,620
The global value of one of these bales went from slightly positive to clearly negative,

198
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,580
and remember, recycling only works when it's profitable.

199
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,940
Therefore, with far fewer buyers, MRF residual bales piled up and up until eventually, the

200
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,740
waste processors gave up and put them into the same category as bottle caps, scraps,

201
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,100
and those other small, unrecoverable, unprofitable pieces of plastic.

202
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,420
Now, when you put something into one of those big blue bins that are supposed to lead to

203
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,780
a second life for your waste, it ends up, more often than not, in the incinerator or

204
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,500
landfill.

205
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,300
Plastic recycling, with the exception of those few highest value items, is now definitively

206
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,520
broken.

207
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,900
But here's the thing—it was always broken.

208
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,460
Plastic recycling, with limited exception, never generated more money than it cost, and

209
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,780
so it was never economically sustainable.

210
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,740
The China system was just a blip, thanks to a unique set of economic circumstances and

211
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,340
a government that didn't yet recognize the cost of the industry's externalities.

212
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,520
That puts the plastics industry back where it was in 1969—people are starting to realize

213
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,740
that there is no way to make plastic sustainable.

214
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,660
There are some half-solutions—some scientists are working to develop an enzyme that can

215
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,940
eat plastic in a matter of days, and others are trying, using chemical processes to break

216
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,740
it down into its raw components, but the recycling problem is not a technical one.

217
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,180
Actually performing the process of taking what's disposed of by consumers, sorting

218
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,980
it, and melting it down into new raw materials is easy.

219
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,760
What's not is the economics.

220
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,260
The recycling problem is an economic one, and you can only solve economic issues with

221
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,160
economics.

222
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,380
The true solution is simple—either the cost of recycling has to come down, or the price

223
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,200
of raw recycled plastic has to go up.

224
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,940
What's going to fix recycling is when it generates more money than it costs, but making

225
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:10,480
that happen will take quite a lot.

226
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,800
If enough consumers, for example, buy products that use recycled plastic, rather than a direct

227
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,080
alternative that uses the virgin variant, market forces will work out in a way that,

228
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,900
eventually, once critical mass is attained, what companies lose from customers choosing

229
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,600
more sustainable alternatives is more than what they lose from paying to swap to more

230
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,200
expensive, lower quality recycled plastic.

231
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:40,960
Plastics recycling, as a system, was never created to make the world a better place.

232
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,720
Rather, it was created by the plastics industry to plug a hole in their system.

233
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,000
It was created to propagate a false belief that consumption could be sustainable, so

234
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,120
the only way to stop plastic from overwhelming our oceans, polluting our land, and making

235
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:05,720
the world a worse place to live in, is to shut the system, the entire system, down.

236
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,940
So, I get a lot of emails—from potential sponsors, companies that want my business,

237
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,380
and other professionals.

238
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,760
I can tell you from personal experience that the biggest red flag for me in cold-call emails

239
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,320
is when the address ends in Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, or another generic provider's domain.

240
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,320
Anyone could create that email in a few seconds, so I have no idea if the person is who they

241
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,640
say they are.

242
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,480
Simply put, if you don't have a professional-looking email address, people won't think you're

243
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
professional.

244
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,920
Whether you're running a small business, going through school, or doing anything else

245
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,880
where you have to send and receive emails, customizing yours with your own domain extension

246
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,240
is the way to go, and Hover makes it incredibly easy.

247
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,040
First, you just search and find a custom domain, and they help you get a super unique one thanks

248
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,300
to their over 400 extensions, and then you take that domain, which you could also use

249
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,580
for your website, and add an email account to it.

250
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,860
You could, quite literally, have a new professional email in about two minutes, and I can personally

251
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,960
attest to how easy Hover makes it since they're what I've used for all my business emails

252
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,360
for years.
