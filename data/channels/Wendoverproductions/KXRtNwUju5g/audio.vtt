00:10.800 --> 00:15.080
This is the two-page document that changed the world.

00:15.080 --> 00:19.900
It's what's referred to as a notification to the World Trade Organization Committee

00:19.900 --> 00:25.040
on Technical Barriers to Trade—a type of document that, to anyone in the know, is thoroughly

00:25.040 --> 00:26.040
mundane.

00:26.920 --> 00:32.960
In fact, every few hours another such notification enters the WTO system, each signifying that

00:32.960 --> 00:37.600
yet another country wants to make yet another change to its rules regarding the import or

00:37.600 --> 00:40.680
export of goods or services.

00:40.680 --> 00:47.960
This particular notification, though, submitted on July 18th, 2017, managed to send the entire

00:47.960 --> 00:55.120
global recycling industry into a tailspin—or possibly even a death spiral.

00:55.120 --> 01:01.560
But simply, this document broke the world's recycling system.

01:01.560 --> 01:03.760
But here's how it worked before this document.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.700
Let's say a woman in Littleton, Colorado has yogurt for breakfast.

01:08.700 --> 01:14.480
The yogurt is packaged in a thin polypropylene plastic container and so, once finished, she

01:14.480 --> 01:17.780
disposes of it into her recycling bin.

01:17.780 --> 01:21.960
This is then picked up by a recycling truck a few days later and brought here to the local

01:21.960 --> 01:25.280
recycling company's Materials Recovery Facility.

01:25.280 --> 01:29.660
There, this yogurt container, along with all the rest of the single-stream recycling picked

01:29.660 --> 01:34.840
up that day, is dumped out and placed into this semi-automated sorting system.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.360
Some products are simple to isolate—most metals, for example, can be picked up by magnets

01:39.360 --> 01:43.240
while paper and cardboard can be easily sorted by density as they're typically lighter

01:43.240 --> 01:44.720
than other recyclables.

01:44.720 --> 01:49.520
Glass, plastics, and non-magnetic metals are a little more difficult to sort, but each

01:49.520 --> 01:54.220
looks quite distinct, so optical scanners operate blowers or other diversion tools that

01:54.220 --> 01:56.580
are able to sort these out.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.300
With a few more steps, the facility is more or less left with just plastic, but that's

02:02.300 --> 02:04.900
where things get difficult.

02:04.900 --> 02:09.840
Plastic comes in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and types, and different shapes, sizes, or

02:09.840 --> 02:13.320
types of plastic are recycled in different ways.

02:13.320 --> 02:17.540
Optical sensors start out by at least accomplishing a high-level sort, though.

02:17.560 --> 02:22.900
For example, in many US states, plastic bottles are sold with a five or ten cent deposit,

02:22.900 --> 02:27.580
meaning that recycling companies put a lot of effort into recovering those from the mix,

02:27.580 --> 02:31.660
as they can be sold for, at least relative to the other plastics, a lot.

02:31.660 --> 02:36.060
They also put a lot of work into recovering certain plastic types, such as high-density

02:36.060 --> 02:40.460
polyethylene, as this both sells for more and is easier to sort out of the mix since

02:40.460 --> 02:44.580
it's typically used to make larger items like plastic crates, shampoo bottles, and

02:44.580 --> 02:47.260
other products where sturdiness matters.

02:47.260 --> 02:51.740
The polyethylene and other higher-value plastics are quite accurately sorted and then melted

02:51.740 --> 02:56.380
down into bulk raw plastic which is resold to manufacturers.

02:56.380 --> 03:01.420
Certain other plastics, though, have a negative value—they can't be sold, and in fact,

03:01.420 --> 03:05.840
it would take so much work to turn them into usable raw material that recycling companies

03:05.840 --> 03:08.920
would have to pay someone to take it off their hands.

03:08.920 --> 03:13.680
Typically falling into this category are smaller items like bottle caps, plastic bags, and

03:13.720 --> 03:18.340
other scraps below three inches or eight centimeters in width that just can't be easily sorted

03:18.340 --> 03:20.320
by automated systems.

03:20.320 --> 03:24.600
These are then aggregated together and, at best, used to generate electricity through

03:24.600 --> 03:28.920
incineration or, at worst, are just sent to a landfill.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.800
So, to summarize, there's high-value plastic that's recovered immediately, negative-value

03:33.800 --> 03:37.740
plastic that's either incinerated or sent to a landfill, and then there's a third

03:37.740 --> 03:43.040
category in between those two, and that's where things get interesting.

03:43.400 --> 03:48.380
Anything that isn't small and unrecoverable or large and valuable is typically mixed together

03:48.380 --> 03:55.120
and formed into big bales of unsorted, medium-size, medium-value plastic that effectively have

03:55.120 --> 03:57.880
a neutral value on the free market.

03:57.880 --> 04:03.520
The raw materials in these bales, known as MRF residuals, is not quite valuable enough

04:03.520 --> 04:07.780
to pay for the sorting process they would need for recycling, which leads to their neutral

04:07.780 --> 04:11.600
value—at least, in the US.

04:11.600 --> 04:15.680
Whenever it takes its trip through the Materials Recovery Facility, that yogurt container from

04:15.680 --> 04:22.340
Littleton, Colorado would, if properly sorted, end up in one of these MRF residual bales.

04:22.340 --> 04:28.120
These are then loaded into the back of a semi-truck driven 1,000 miles to the port of Long Beach,

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
California.

04:29.120 --> 04:34.040
There, the bales are officially exported from the US, loaded into a shipping container,

04:34.040 --> 04:39.360
and placed on an enormous, yet empty, Hong Kong-bound cargo ship.

04:39.360 --> 04:46.700
Now, with this knowledge, some might ask a question—how on earth did we end up with

04:46.700 --> 04:52.160
this system, theoretically designed to reduce our impact on the world, where our waste is

04:52.160 --> 04:54.720
shipped across the world?

04:54.720 --> 04:59.640
To that, there's actually a surprisingly specific answer.

04:59.640 --> 05:06.080
Decades ago, in 1969, the first national conference on packaging waste convened, and in that room

05:06.080 --> 05:09.240
were a number of plastics industry executives.

05:09.240 --> 05:13.440
Throughout that event, they heard municipal leaders from around the country express their

05:13.440 --> 05:17.760
concern about just how permanent plastic was.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.420
Back then, the material was becoming cheaper and cheaper and was quickly gaining prominence

05:22.420 --> 05:27.660
in the packaging world, but this mounting concern among municipal leaders itself led

05:27.660 --> 05:31.400
to mounting concern among plastics executives.

05:31.400 --> 05:37.400
They came to believe that this plastic hesitancy would quickly become an existential threat

05:37.400 --> 05:42.160
for the industry's growth, so plastics knew they needed a solution.

05:42.160 --> 05:46.360
They needed a way to make plastic sustainable.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.620
The problem?

05:47.620 --> 05:49.040
There wasn't one.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.120
So, backup option.

05:51.120 --> 05:56.920
Rather than creating a real solution, they willfully and knowingly created and propagated

05:56.920 --> 06:02.880
a system that didn't work, but looked like a solution—recycling.

06:02.880 --> 06:08.420
From a technical standpoint, you can sort, melt down, and reuse plastic, thereby reducing

06:08.420 --> 06:12.920
its impact on the world, but that's not why it doesn't work.

06:12.920 --> 06:17.840
From a social perspective, people do often do their part and, at least somewhat, separate

06:17.840 --> 06:22.560
their trash from recycling, but that's also not why it doesn't work.

06:22.560 --> 06:28.160
Why recycling doesn't work is because, overall, it's not profitable.

06:28.160 --> 06:34.780
It's very simple—oil is cheap, at least now, and when oil is cheap, making new plastic

06:34.780 --> 06:35.780
is cheap.

06:35.780 --> 06:41.560
Meanwhile, sorting, transporting, and melting down existing plastic is expensive.

06:41.560 --> 06:50.360
In 2017, virgin PET plastic cost about $0.54 per pound, while recycled PET cost about $0.63

06:50.360 --> 06:54.280
per pound and was lower quality than the alternative.

06:54.280 --> 06:59.440
Therefore, demand for recycled PET was low, so waste management companies couldn't turn

06:59.440 --> 07:05.000
a profit turning used PET into raw, recycled PET at scale.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.560
When companies can't make a profit recycling, it doesn't happen—or, at least not at

07:09.560 --> 07:12.800
the rates needed to make the plastics industry sustainable.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.560
For the plastics industry, though, all they needed was the perception of sustainability

07:17.560 --> 07:23.960
and, even though a big chunk of what went into a recycling bin ended up not recycled,

07:23.960 --> 07:28.600
consumers and municipal leaders were happy because they believed that the plastic they

07:28.600 --> 07:30.600
consumed was guilt-free.

07:30.600 --> 07:36.920
That's how that yogurt container tossed in Littleton, Colorado ended up on a boat

07:36.920 --> 07:38.480
to Hong Kong.

07:38.480 --> 07:45.240
Now, the rule just mentioned is still valid—plastic is only recycled when it's profitable—but

07:45.240 --> 07:52.880
for a brief moment in time, it was, all thanks to a trifecta of economic conditions in China.

07:52.880 --> 07:56.600
First, shipping was incredibly cheap.

07:56.600 --> 08:02.840
Western nations like the US have long had a significant trade deficit with China—essentially,

08:02.840 --> 08:07.020
America buys far more from China than China does from America.

08:07.020 --> 08:11.840
That means that cargo ships from Greater China travel to the US almost completely full, but

08:11.840 --> 08:17.520
then return with plenty of extra capacity, meaning shipping rates to China are far lower

08:17.520 --> 08:20.200
than shipping rates from China.

08:20.200 --> 08:25.280
Thanks to that, you could get one of those MRF residual bales across the Pacific for

08:25.280 --> 08:27.360
next to nothing.

08:27.360 --> 08:32.720
In addition to this, since the 1980s, China has been riding its way through an unprecedented

08:32.720 --> 08:35.160
phase of economic growth.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.620
This was so dramatic that the company's industries literally could not find enough

08:39.620 --> 08:43.660
raw materials, including plastic, to fulfill their demand.

08:43.660 --> 08:49.140
Therefore, with constrained supply and high demand, even recycled plastic prices went

08:49.140 --> 08:53.900
up, giving the recyclers in the country more room to cover costs.

08:53.900 --> 08:59.900
In addition, especially in more rural areas, wages were low in China.

08:59.900 --> 09:04.740
Those MRF residual bales are composed of those difficult-to-sort plastics, but humans can

09:04.740 --> 09:10.420
sort just about anything profitably, as long as their wages are low enough.

09:10.420 --> 09:15.740
So, all in all, considering shipping to China was effectively free, and raw materials were

09:15.740 --> 09:21.780
higher, and wages were low, the equation just happened to work out that in the late 90s,

09:21.780 --> 09:29.820
2000s, and early 2010s, sorting and recycling MRF residual bales in China was just ever-so-slightly

09:29.820 --> 09:30.820
profitable.

09:30.900 --> 09:36.500
That's why, upon arrival into Hong Kong, the plastic yogurt container disposed of in

09:36.500 --> 09:41.380
Lyttelton, along with everything else in these bales, is immediately transferred onto a smaller

09:41.380 --> 09:46.260
barge and re-exported out of Hong Kong for a short journey across the Pearl River Delta

09:46.260 --> 09:49.180
to the Guangdong province in mainland China.

09:49.180 --> 09:56.460
Then, after an 8,000 mile, 13,000 kilometer journey to the other side of the world, it

09:56.460 --> 09:59.520
ends up at its final destination.

09:59.520 --> 10:04.240
The Wellpine Plastic Industrial Company, just outside Guangzhou.

10:04.240 --> 10:09.380
There, the bales are unloaded, spread out, and low-wage workers manually sift through

10:09.380 --> 10:14.080
the contents, eventually finding that yogurt container and putting it in a pile along with

10:14.080 --> 10:17.080
the rest of the polypropylene plastics.

10:17.080 --> 10:21.820
From there, the polypropylenes are melted down, purified, and reformed into pallets

10:21.820 --> 10:27.520
which then, eventually, are sold in bulk to another manufacturer, somewhere else in China,

10:27.520 --> 10:30.840
for a very, very slight profit.

10:30.840 --> 10:37.040
Now, this whole system, of taking effectively valueless MRF residual bales and shipping

10:37.040 --> 10:42.800
them across the world to a place where they did have a very slight positive value, worked.

10:42.800 --> 10:48.980
It was intelligent, it wasn't clean, but it worked, and that's how, for a few decades,

10:48.980 --> 10:52.900
the Western World Recycling System functioned.

10:52.900 --> 10:57.880
The most valuable stuff was sorted and sold domestically, the valueless stuff was exported

10:57.880 --> 11:03.500
to where it had value in China, and the stuff with a negative value was sent to the landfill

11:03.500 --> 11:05.760
or incinerated.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.820
But then came that document.

11:08.820 --> 11:14.540
The notification to the World Trade Organization Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade.

11:14.540 --> 11:21.580
All this said was that China would, starting at the end of 2017, ban the import of 24 products

11:21.580 --> 11:27.860
covered under these HS codes—the numerical classifications used to simplify international

11:27.860 --> 11:29.300
trade.

11:29.300 --> 11:34.520
These particular five, though, were the ones that created this big problem for the plastics

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
industry.

11:35.520 --> 11:41.220
They translate to waste, pairings, and other scrap of polymers of ethylene, of polymers

11:41.220 --> 11:46.820
of styrene, of polymers of vinyl chloride, of polyethylene glycol terephthalate, and

11:46.820 --> 11:50.020
other waste, pairings, and scraps of plastics.

11:50.020 --> 11:57.200
Effectively, by banning these five HS codes, they banned the import of almost all plastic

11:57.200 --> 11:58.700
waste.

11:58.700 --> 12:07.820
As a result, the country's 2018 plastic import volume dropped 99.1% compared to 2017—this

12:07.820 --> 12:12.620
massive, global industry quite literally ended overnight.

12:12.620 --> 12:19.220
Now, while the true reasoning behind any Chinese government decision is always elusive, at

12:19.220 --> 12:24.000
least according to this document, it was that the import of these products was creating

12:24.000 --> 12:27.940
a serious environmental and public health problem.

12:27.940 --> 12:30.180
This is likely true.

12:30.180 --> 12:36.400
As MRF residual bales are, by their very nature, unsorted, they often included hazardous materials

12:36.400 --> 12:41.900
that could seriously harm those sorting them, and this went on to cost the government since

12:41.900 --> 12:44.900
the government runs much of the country's healthcare system.

12:45.160 --> 12:50.340
In addition, the sorting facilities in China would often illegally dump the portion of

12:50.340 --> 12:55.100
the plastics that even they couldn't profitably recover, creating an environmental problem

12:55.100 --> 12:58.220
that the government had to pay to clean up.

12:58.220 --> 13:03.180
Therefore, while the private companies that actually sorted and processed these MRF residual

13:03.180 --> 13:11.220
bales turned a slight profit, China as a nation was losing money by processing the world's

13:11.220 --> 13:12.220
trash.

13:12.220 --> 13:17.220
So, essentially, even though it looked like plastic recycling was profitable, once the

13:17.220 --> 13:23.560
externalities were priced in, it once again became clear that plastic recycling was not,

13:23.560 --> 13:25.540
in fact, a viable system.

13:25.540 --> 13:30.900
That's why China issued this document, that's why they banned plastic waste import, and

13:30.900 --> 13:34.380
that's why the world's recycling system broke.

13:34.380 --> 13:40.060
Nowadays, when a woman in Littleton, Colorado throws her yogurt container into the recycling

13:40.060 --> 13:44.700
bin, the journey that ensues is often far, far shorter.

13:44.700 --> 13:50.580
First, as before, it's picked up by a truck, brought to a materials recovery facility,

13:50.580 --> 13:55.700
sorted down, and packed into one of those MRF residual bales, but after, there are now

13:55.700 --> 13:58.300
three main options.

13:58.300 --> 14:03.520
The first is that it's exported, as before, but not to China.

14:03.520 --> 14:09.180
In response to the import ban, Malaysia tripled their plastic import volume between 2017 and

14:09.180 --> 14:14.720
2018, becoming the largest processor in the world, and some other nearby low-wage countries

14:14.720 --> 14:16.220
ramped up as well.

14:16.220 --> 14:22.360
Eventually, though, these countries will undoubtedly realize what China did—processing MRF residual

14:22.360 --> 14:27.240
bales may be profitable to a company, but not to a country.

14:27.240 --> 14:32.700
The amount of health and environmental issues it creates in the long run costs more than

14:32.700 --> 14:35.020
the industry makes.

14:35.020 --> 14:40.540
Even despite the alternate plastic export options, the US's export volume, which includes

14:40.540 --> 14:47.960
more than just MRF residual bales, still dropped by a third between 2017 and 2018.

14:47.960 --> 14:53.180
There was just no one who would take these bales, even for free, since with the removal

14:53.180 --> 14:58.180
of China from the market, very few companies could turn a profit processing them, even

14:58.180 --> 14:59.940
outside the US.

14:59.940 --> 15:05.620
The global value of one of these bales went from slightly positive to clearly negative,

15:05.620 --> 15:09.580
and remember, recycling only works when it's profitable.

15:09.580 --> 15:15.940
Therefore, with far fewer buyers, MRF residual bales piled up and up until eventually, the

15:15.940 --> 15:21.740
waste processors gave up and put them into the same category as bottle caps, scraps,

15:21.740 --> 15:27.100
and those other small, unrecoverable, unprofitable pieces of plastic.

15:27.100 --> 15:32.420
Now, when you put something into one of those big blue bins that are supposed to lead to

15:32.420 --> 15:38.780
a second life for your waste, it ends up, more often than not, in the incinerator or

15:38.780 --> 15:40.500
landfill.

15:40.500 --> 15:46.300
Plastic recycling, with the exception of those few highest value items, is now definitively

15:46.300 --> 15:48.520
broken.

15:48.520 --> 15:51.900
But here's the thing—it was always broken.

15:51.900 --> 15:57.460
Plastic recycling, with limited exception, never generated more money than it cost, and

15:57.460 --> 16:00.780
so it was never economically sustainable.

16:00.780 --> 16:05.740
The China system was just a blip, thanks to a unique set of economic circumstances and

16:05.740 --> 16:10.340
a government that didn't yet recognize the cost of the industry's externalities.

16:10.340 --> 16:15.520
That puts the plastics industry back where it was in 1969—people are starting to realize

16:15.520 --> 16:18.740
that there is no way to make plastic sustainable.

16:18.740 --> 16:23.660
There are some half-solutions—some scientists are working to develop an enzyme that can

16:23.660 --> 16:27.940
eat plastic in a matter of days, and others are trying, using chemical processes to break

16:27.940 --> 16:33.740
it down into its raw components, but the recycling problem is not a technical one.

16:33.740 --> 16:38.180
Actually performing the process of taking what's disposed of by consumers, sorting

16:38.180 --> 16:41.980
it, and melting it down into new raw materials is easy.

16:41.980 --> 16:44.760
What's not is the economics.

16:44.760 --> 16:50.260
The recycling problem is an economic one, and you can only solve economic issues with

16:50.260 --> 16:52.160
economics.

16:52.160 --> 16:58.380
The true solution is simple—either the cost of recycling has to come down, or the price

16:58.380 --> 17:01.200
of raw recycled plastic has to go up.

17:01.200 --> 17:06.940
What's going to fix recycling is when it generates more money than it costs, but making

17:06.940 --> 17:10.480
that happen will take quite a lot.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.800
If enough consumers, for example, buy products that use recycled plastic, rather than a direct

17:15.800 --> 17:21.080
alternative that uses the virgin variant, market forces will work out in a way that,

17:21.080 --> 17:25.900
eventually, once critical mass is attained, what companies lose from customers choosing

17:25.900 --> 17:30.600
more sustainable alternatives is more than what they lose from paying to swap to more

17:30.600 --> 17:34.200
expensive, lower quality recycled plastic.

17:34.920 --> 17:40.960
Plastics recycling, as a system, was never created to make the world a better place.

17:40.960 --> 17:46.720
Rather, it was created by the plastics industry to plug a hole in their system.

17:46.720 --> 17:52.000
It was created to propagate a false belief that consumption could be sustainable, so

17:52.000 --> 17:58.120
the only way to stop plastic from overwhelming our oceans, polluting our land, and making

17:58.120 --> 18:05.720
the world a worse place to live in, is to shut the system, the entire system, down.

18:05.720 --> 18:12.940
So, I get a lot of emails—from potential sponsors, companies that want my business,

18:12.940 --> 18:14.380
and other professionals.

18:14.380 --> 18:19.760
I can tell you from personal experience that the biggest red flag for me in cold-call emails

18:19.760 --> 18:25.320
is when the address ends in Gmail, iCloud, Yahoo, or another generic provider's domain.

18:25.520 --> 18:29.320
Anyone could create that email in a few seconds, so I have no idea if the person is who they

18:29.320 --> 18:30.640
say they are.

18:30.640 --> 18:36.480
Simply put, if you don't have a professional-looking email address, people won't think you're

18:36.480 --> 18:37.480
professional.

18:37.480 --> 18:40.920
Whether you're running a small business, going through school, or doing anything else

18:40.920 --> 18:45.880
where you have to send and receive emails, customizing yours with your own domain extension

18:45.880 --> 18:49.240
is the way to go, and Hover makes it incredibly easy.

18:49.240 --> 18:54.040
First, you just search and find a custom domain, and they help you get a super unique one thanks

18:54.040 --> 18:58.300
to their over 400 extensions, and then you take that domain, which you could also use

18:58.300 --> 19:01.580
for your website, and add an email account to it.

19:01.580 --> 19:06.860
You could, quite literally, have a new professional email in about two minutes, and I can personally

19:06.860 --> 19:11.960
attest to how easy Hover makes it since they're what I've used for all my business emails

19:11.960 --> 19:13.360
for years.

19:13.360 --> 19:18.200
