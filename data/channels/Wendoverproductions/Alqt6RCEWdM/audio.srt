1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
I remember exactly where I was.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,380
Sydney International Airport waded into board

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,680
a 10-hour flight to Tokyo,

4
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,340
followed by a 12-hour flight to Boston,

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,580
then a one-hour one to D.C. to arrive home

6
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,780
the day before Thanksgiving, 2018.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,380
My agent Dave said he had an idea he wanted to run past me,

8
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,980
so he popped on a call.

9
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,620
He had just talked to Vimeo, the video streaming platform.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,100
They were trying to persuade him to persuade

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,420
one of his other clients to build a paywall streaming site

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,300
for their videos using their tech.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,640
This, and infinite minor variations of this,

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,900
was something we'd get pitched constantly as creators,

15
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,100
but everyone recognized that it couldn't really work.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,300
In fact, it had a long history of not working.

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,540
Perhaps the most flashy failure was Vessel.

18
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,780
It launched in early 2015

19
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,480
with the big-name creators of the time.

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,180
Good Mythical Morning, Epic Meal Time,

21
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,080
Shane Dawson, Linus Tech Tips.

22
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,660
It was basically a YouTube replacement.

23
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,680
Same content, same creators, same features,

24
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,060
with the addition that users could pay $2.99 a month

25
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,000
to watch videos 72 hours early.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,900
Combine that with their supposedly unique

27
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,220
advertising ecosystem, and the pitch to creators

28
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,300
was that they could earn dramatically more per view.

29
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,400
This is always the core proposition

30
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,040
with these alternate streaming services.

31
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,200
More revenue per view,

32
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,240
but they almost always have the same problem.

33
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,880
The number of views is orders of magnitude lower.

34
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,580
Platforms have to extract value from the audience somehow,

35
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,840
whether through a paywall or through

36
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,280
more intrusive advertising.

37
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,120
So why would a viewer watch on your platform

38
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,560
when they could watch the exact same content on YouTube

39
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,420
for free and with less intrusive advertising?

40
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,420
So creators signed on to platforms like Vessel,

41
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,960
get menial views compared to YouTube,

42
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,600
and before these platforms can grow enough

43
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,760
to get to a point where it's worth it

44
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,540
for creators beyond an initial test group,

45
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,500
they run out of money and shut down.

46
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,060
But we had some ideas on how we could fix that.

47
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,040
We thought there was a chance that we had identified

48
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,300
a magic formula that we were in a uniquely good position

49
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,220
to undertake that could make this simple concept work

50
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,680
where all others had failed.

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
Four years later, well, not to brag, but we were right.

52
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,820
Nebula has grown massively.

53
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,020
Over 650,000 paying users, 100 staff members,

54
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,320
a conservative overall valuation of over $150 million,

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,580
and it did all of that with absolutely zero dollars

56
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,320
of venture capital funding.

57
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,760
So what did we do different?

58
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,460
Why were we able to make this simple concept work

59
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,520
when all others had failed?

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,160
Clearly this video is going to be different.

61
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,700
I'm not gonna be talking about logistics or geopolitics

62
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
or infrastructure or another business.

63
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,240
I'm talking about my business.

64
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,140
So that's why, for the first time, I'm here.

65
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,880
This was a tricky video to write.

66
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,440
I'm trying to use my unique combination of positions

67
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,280
as an owner of a now sizable business and as a creator

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,200
to tell an intimate inside story

69
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,680
of how you can grow an idea into an enterprise.

70
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,180
There are a lot of things that can't be said

71
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,640
for legal or practical reasons,

72
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,920
and there are countless different stakeholders involved.

73
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,560
So what follows is what I believe is the fullest story

74
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,060
anyone can tell about the inside operations

75
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,760
of a business of this size and nature,

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,260
but there are, unfortunately,

77
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,020
some things I just can't talk about.

78
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,160
It's a long story, but it begins in a very small way.

79
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,920
On July 27th, 2016,

80
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,220
I got this DM from Philip Detmer of Curse Protect.

81
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,820
Hey man, let's get right to it.

82
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,980
So me and another big YouTuber might be starting something,

83
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,860
but I can't really talk about it yet.

84
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,960
We went back and forth for a month trying to schedule a call,

85
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,100
then finally we talked.

86
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,060
Basically, Philip was going to introduce me

87
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,700
to the freelance sponsorship agent

88
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,360
he and CGP Grey had been working with for years,

89
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,960
and later that might turn into something bigger.

90
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,200
That freelance sponsorship agent was Dave Whiskas.

91
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,300
That's a name you'll want to remember.

92
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,840
It's pretty relevant throughout.

93
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,660
We talked, he promised better rates

94
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,860
through a data-driven approach with an upfront commission.

95
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,140
I somehow believed him,

96
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,060
but eventually it turned out he was actually right.

97
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,500
Some important context.

98
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,800
The industry that had arisen around YouTube creators in 2016

99
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,640
was chock full of liars, cheats, and thieves.

100
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,860
It was only over the prior couple of years

101
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,700
that people could start to make a living off of YouTube,

102
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,820
and seemingly the first people

103
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,420
that thought to insert themselves as middlemen

104
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,480
were all glorified grifters.

105
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,140
Getting sponsored is crucial to going full-time on YouTube.

106
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,720
AdSense alone rarely cuts it,

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,580
so at the time, the only deals I could land

108
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,040
for my fledgling channel were ones

109
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,980
that automatically locked me into six months of exclusivity

110
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,460
with the agency I booked through

111
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,680
without any guarantee they would actually fill video inventory

112
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,460
and with undisclosed commissions.

113
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,720
Undisclosed commissions in this context

114
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,580
means they just told you exactly what you'd get paid,

115
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,680
which sounds great in theory, but in practice,

116
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,340
what it means is that they're selling the slot

117
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,980
to the sponsor for one price,

118
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,320
then paying you a completely different, lower price,

119
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,020
and never telling you what the difference was.

120
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,960
So just decide what they think you'll accept,

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,320
but you have little leverage to say no,

122
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
because once again, you're locked into exclusivity.

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,480
You're only legally allowed to work with them.

124
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,920
Oh, and also, contractually,

125
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,840
they represented the sponsor, not the creator,

126
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,320
so their incentives were to push the price

127
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,440
as low as it could go.

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
If you didn't like it and wanted to jump ship,

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,000
you had to go without sponsorship for six months,

130
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,760
which would kill your finances.

131
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,840
I've seen hard evidence that this particular agency

132
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,400
was taking a 50% undisclosed commission

133
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,760
on certain creator sponsorships,

134
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,560
so it's no wonder why Dave was able

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,960
to immediately beat their rates

136
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,660
and get sponsors to come back.

137
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,280
They might have actually been paying less,

138
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,900
but I, the creator, was getting more hit.

139
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,140
By chance, Gray and Philip had also introduced Dave

140
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,540
to Brian from Real Engineering.

141
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,140
We had collaborated on a set of videos

142
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,660
that turned out to be big viral hits

143
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,700
that launched both of our channels into relevancy,

144
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,740
so he was one of my first creator friends.

145
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,060
The next one was Joseph from RealLifeLore.

146
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,740
I had never met him in person, but we had talked plenty,

147
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,960
so I convinced him to fly out

148
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,380
to the inaugural VidCon Europe in Amsterdam in April 2017.

149
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,140
Part of the reason was because I had been nagging Dave

150
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,580
for months to work with Joseph,

151
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,400
whose channel was exploding, and Dave would be there too,

152
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,120
the perfect opportunity for them to meet.

153
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,920
Joseph ended up having a nightmare weekend

154
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,360
of travel delays, some snowstorm or something,

155
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,340
so he didn't end up getting there

156
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,240
until the afternoon of the last day,

157
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,520
but I introduced everyone and we headed to a bar.

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,720
We stayed there for hours.

159
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
Everyone hit it off,

160
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,040
and it capped off an exhilarating week out,

161
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,740
the first time any of us had seen a physical manifestation

162
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,920
of the industry we had inserted ourselves into.

163
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,160
After working in isolation, it was eye-opening

164
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,880
to see and talk to so many others

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
doing the same thing as us, and according to Dave,

166
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,060
in retrospect, this was the moment when he fully realized

167
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,140
that this informal system of freelance sponsorship booking

168
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,700
could grow into something more.

169
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,080
It'd be called Standard, a purposely forgettable name

170
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,380
for a company designed to exist in the background,

171
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,220
making life easier for the creators on center stage,

172
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,060
and it worked.

173
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,280
Creators were simply just having a better experience

174
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,460
working with Standard.

175
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,740
The rates were strong, the experience was personal,

176
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,460
the ethos ethical, in a landscape filled with grifters

177
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,980
and cheats, the concept of a sponsorship agency

178
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,680
simply doing its job fairly

179
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,280
was enough to drive natural word-of-mouth growth.

180
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,060
We added dozens of creators to the roster

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,560
and started to be viewed as the go-to agency

182
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,800
for educational YouTube.

183
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,480
We hired staff, got an office,

184
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,960
started throwing VidCon parties, it was all happening.

185
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,480
Unbelievably, this part, the part that at the time

186
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,080
felt like hard-earned yet incredible success,

187
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,760
needs to get glossed over to get to the good part,

188
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,920
November 27th, 2018.

189
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,400
After a couple of days of back and forth

190
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
with myself and a few other creators,

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,440
that's when Dave emailed his full roster of creators

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,580
the white paper, the initial concept

193
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,540
laying out our vision for Nebula.

194
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,380
This is that exact email.

195
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,860
In some ways, it was close.

196
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,880
How would this work?

197
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,140
Standard creators post ad and sponsor-free versions

198
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,620
of their videos, and occasionally

199
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,420
the service premieres exclusive content.

200
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,660
Let's say we charge users $5 per month for their service.

201
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,300
All of this is still true to this day, even the price.

202
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,420
In other ways, we were way off.

203
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,780
How do we attract viewers?

204
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,940
First, we can simply buy AdSense ads on Standard channels.

205
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,200
Sponsoring our own creators feels wrong, at least for now.

206
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,240
We can revisit it later if we think we can do it

207
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,120
without looking dumb.

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
This is about as wrong as it could be.

209
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,360
We have never figured out how to make AdSense marketing

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,640
for Nebula profitable, while sponsoring YouTube creators

211
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,800
has been the driving growth force.

212
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,200
We'll get to how we made that work.

213
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,800
But the real key that we understood from day one

214
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,520
was that opportunity cost.

215
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,800
To Standard, but especially to creators,

216
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,240
had to be as small as it could possibly be.

217
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,720
Equivalents before us always raised a huge amount

218
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,420
of venture capital funding, made a big splash at launch,

219
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,180
and ran out of money before profitability,

220
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,500
leaving creators embarrassed when they folded.

221
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,540
We knew that creators were wary of aligning themselves

222
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,380
to something so risky, so we needed to make a small splash.

223
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,340
We needed to design Nebula to fail gracefully.

224
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,540
We needed to make it so that if it did fail,

225
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,940
it would have the smallest possible impact

226
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,180
on reputation and finances.

227
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,100
Essentially, we followed the most dramatic form

228
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,580
of the minimum viable product model of innovation.

229
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,140
We needed to get a super scrappy version of the product

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,800
out into the public so that rather than us having to guess,

231
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,360
they, the customers, would tell us what they wanted

232
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,800
through how they acted.

233
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,480
You watch consumer behavior in order to fulfill their wants.

234
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,800
Luckily, a lot of the bones were already in place.

235
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,240
Dave's prior life was in the iOS app development world,

236
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,520
so he had a lot of experience in software.

237
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,280
We actually had a few engineers on staff

238
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,640
to work on the backend tool we use for sponsor billing

239
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,160
and inventory management.

240
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,080
The trickiest bit would be the actual streaming.

241
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,720
The big platforms like YouTube and Netflix

242
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,800
make it look easy, but it's quite a technical challenge

243
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,740
to distribute high-quality video on low-quality internet

244
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,700
all across the globe, and we didn't possibly

245
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,320
have the money to build our own streaming tech.

246
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,220
Of course, Vimeo originally approached us,

247
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,580
but the problem with partnering with them

248
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,100
was that they'd have owned the billing relationship.

249
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,700
Basically, when someone signed up,

250
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Vimeo would keep their credit card details and info,

251
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,220
and while we'd get the money,

252
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,820
if we ever decided to split with them,

253
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,300
there was no guarantee we'd keep the subscribers.

254
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,500
So we'd rather decided to partner

255
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,620
with another streaming provider called Zype.

256
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,940
Therefore, all we had to build was a front end,

257
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,700
a slick, flashy user interface

258
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,200
to make it all look professional, and an iOS app.

259
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
We barely even had a backend.

260
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,140
We had Eric, who doubled as our podcast editor,

261
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
who would take the videos creators added

262
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,800
to a shared Dropbox folder, run them through the encoder,

263
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,560
and post them in the right spot with the right metadata.

264
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,640
All in all, it cost around $100,000

265
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,080
to get Nebula ready for launch,

266
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,200
an incredibly low sum for both the website and app,

267
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
but there was still one key thing we were missing.

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,400
You see, creators don't talk unless they're paid to.

269
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,440
This is because creators are paid to talk.

270
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,660
It's just pragmatic.

271
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
You basically get one call to action per video.

272
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,020
You're lucky to successfully get someone

273
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,500
to listen to one call to action,

274
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,980
so what the data shows is that if a creator, for example,

275
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,220
runs a sponsor read, then promotes their Patreon,

276
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,700
what they'll see on average

277
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,200
is that they'll earn less overall

278
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,940
than if they had just promoted the sponsor

279
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,820
as the Patreon push cuts into performance more

280
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,380
than it drives additional revenue.

281
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,460
It's not always intuitive,

282
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,060
but it's a quirk of audience behavior

283
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,360
that we'd understood for years

284
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,760
running sponsorships in standard.

285
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,260
Therefore, we knew we couldn't just simply ask creators

286
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,380
to promote Nebula out of the goodness of their arms.

287
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,960
Not only would this hurt their revenue,

288
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,280
which would mean they would stop working

289
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,520
with Nebula in the long run,

290
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,080
this would hurt standards revenue, too,

291
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,360
since it came from commission on sponsorships.

292
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,800
At the time, Standard and Nebula

293
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,320
were literally the same company

294
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,040
with zero legal separation,

295
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,680
so weirdly, free promotion for Nebula

296
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
would cut off the revenue source

297
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,640
that we were using to build Nebula.

298
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,980
We didn't immediately have a solution to this.

299
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,560
In all honesty, this was the biggest flaw

300
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,320
with the business model at launch.

301
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
But again, the launch was designed to be an experiment,

302
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,320
designed to be that minimum viable product.

303
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,360
We didn't necessarily need a big marketing method

304
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,900
at launch because the launch was designed

305
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,140
to help us find that,

306
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,660
so the last piece that we needed

307
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,780
was for the creators to be emotionally invested.

308
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,500
Everyone was excited by the concept,

309
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,360
but to assure people would stay excited

310
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,600
through the inevitably difficult early days,

311
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,640
well, we figured they might as well be financially invested.

312
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,620
So, through complex financial and legal wizardry,

313
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,260
we developed a system where 50% of Nebula profits

314
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,620
were distributed to creators, including, crucially,

315
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,820
if the platform were ever to be sold.

316
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,920
It means if one day the platform were to sell for,

317
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,520
let's say, a billion dollars,

318
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,160
the creators would get half of that.

319
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,720
We split that pool based on watch time,

320
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
meaning the more creators bring in and engage an audience,

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,700
the bigger a share they're entitled to.

322
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,280
In the short term, this would be a concept

323
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,160
that would keep creators building for the future.

324
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
In the medium term, this would allocate profit to creators

325
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,680
based on how much they contributed to growing that profit.

326
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,000
And in the long term, if Nebula were ever to sell,

327
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
this would make that a scenario where everyone wins,

328
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,760
rather than one where the platform wins

329
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,200
off the hard work of creators.

330
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,500
Not only would this directly tie platform success

331
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,440
to creator success and vice versa,

332
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,880
it would also keep everyone in that collaborative mindset,

333
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,360
one where Nebula and its creators were business partners,

334
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
rather than clients and servicers.

335
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,520
We win together, and we lose together.

336
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,360
Next, launch.

337
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,040
We didn't have some massive plan.

338
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,760
The website had been up and running for a bit

339
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
as we squashed bugs, so what really marked

340
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,120
the formal launch, if anything did,

341
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,280
was the first public promotion of the platform.

342
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,520
That came from Isaac Arthur.

343
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,040
On the morning of Thursday, May 23rd, 2019,

344
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,720
he released a video called Colonizing Black Holes,

345
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,060
which ended with a push to his Nebula original,

346
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,500
one of the first three called the Paperclip Maximizer.

347
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,660
We also had originals that launched from real life lore,

348
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,060
Second Thought, and Polyphonic,

349
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,820
so we each released videos mentioning Nebula

350
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,860
funded by a small and finite pool of money

351
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,460
dedicated to launch promotion.

352
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,620
This first weekend went better

353
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,380
than we possibly could have hoped for.

354
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,860
By Monday, we had over 4,500 signups.

355
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,900
They were trial signups, plenty would cancel,

356
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,220
but that gave us plenty enough data to work with

357
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,140
to figure out how to make this all work.

358
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,340
Better yet, we were getting buzz.

359
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,200
A lot of it was negative.

360
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,880
Almost everyone thought we'd get added

361
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,400
to the long list of failed alternate streaming sites,

362
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,600
but at the least, this told us that the idea

363
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,460
was exciting enough that people cared to care about us.

364
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,560
Over the following weeks and months,

365
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,920
we used some of our cash on hand

366
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,880
to run some very small additional marketing tests,

367
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
basically seeing if we could pay creators

368
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,720
a similar rate to their other sponsors

369
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,380
and bring in enough subscribers

370
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,080
to justify paying that much.

371
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,480
The answers we got were promising.

372
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,800
On one test we did on my podcast, Extremities,

373
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,020
Nebula paid us $800 and got 200 signups,

374
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,140
each of whom would pay $5 a month.

375
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:11,820
The only problem, we didn't have cash.

376
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,380
While we'd eventually generate cash

377
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,540
with the monthly revenue these subscribers brought in,

378
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,260
that'd be a very slow process,

379
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,660
meaning it'd be quite a while

380
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,900
until we could start sponsoring the larger YouTube channels

381
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,900
and developing bigger Nebula originals.

382
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,100
But we found a solution.

383
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,460
Standard had long-run sponsorships for CuriosityStream.

384
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,580
Another streaming service focused on documentary

385
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,300
and non-fiction content founded by Jon Hendricks,

386
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,200
the Discovery Channel.

387
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,100
To their credit, they didn't get scared

388
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,100
thinking creators were trying to replace them,

389
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,900
but rather understood that we were appealing

390
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,420
to a different, complementary market.

391
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,780
So Dave went down to the offices just outside of DC

392
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:46,300
and came out the other end with a win-win.

393
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,380
We'd bundle.

394
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,780
While I can't discuss the exact behind-the-scenes mechanics,

395
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,140
we found a way to make it worthwhile for both companies

396
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,620
so that when customers signed up for CuriosityStream

397
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,540
through each creator's sponsorship links,

398
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,980
they'd get access to Nebula for free.

399
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,340
Nobody could really see a downside,

400
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,740
so we negotiated details, signed a term sheet,

401
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
and as of September 2019, every Nebula creator

402
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,800
just started promoting the bundle

403
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
in their already-booked CuriosityStream spots.

404
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,800
In retrospect, it seems like a minor,

405
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,040
ultimately easy change, but it yielded massive results.

406
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,160
Personally, the bundle deal supercharged

407
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,600
my sponsorship performance.

408
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,600
It was clear that the offering of CuriosityStream

409
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,480
and Nebula together was a more convincing sell

410
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,400
to our audiences than any other sponsor

411
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,300
we ran on the channel.

412
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,140
Even better, we started to understand

413
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,720
the marketing message that worked.

414
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
Pushing to behind-the-scenes videos or extended cuts

415
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,340
didn't really work.

416
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,460
Pushing the idea of no ads or sponsorship

417
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,460
on Nebula worked okay, but the thing that clearly created

418
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,100
these performance multiples was full-length,

419
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,860
high-budget, exclusive originals.

420
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,500
Seeing that, CuriosityStream started

421
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,460
to co-produce Nebula originals with us.

422
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,060
In October 2019, to film our highest-budget,

423
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,500
most ambitious one to date, I flew all the way

424
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,580
to the remote Atlantic island of St. Helena

425
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,860
to make the world's most useful airport.

426
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,340
While I was there, we crossed 10,000 paying subscribers,

427
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,240
then it took less than a month more to hit 20,000.

428
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,040
By the end of the year, we had crossed 35,000,

429
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,080
and in six short months, Nebula had transformed

430
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,240
from an idea into a fast-growth startup.

431
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,480
Now, through all this history,

432
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,140
I was not actually an owner of Standard,

433
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,400
just a highly involved long-term client,

434
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,640
but it was clearly something I was interested in.

435
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,960
I was there from the start, I had helped it grow,

436
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,840
and I believed in it, and specifically Nebula's future.

437
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,520
In 2020, an opportunity arose.

438
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,860
Gray and Philip were less keen on Nebula.

439
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,420
It seemed to make less sense to them,

440
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,100
while the rest of the creator roster was,

441
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,360
so they were looking for a way

442
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,960
to end their involvement with the company.

443
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,620
Therefore, Brian from Real Engineering,

444
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,900
Alex from LowSpecGamer, Devin from Legal Eagle,

445
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,380
Thomas Frank, and myself agreed

446
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,940
to purchase their ownership stakes

447
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,420
and divide it up amongst ourselves,

448
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,140
and we were all extremely bullish on Nebula.

449
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,900
By chance, that sale occurred in March 2020,

450
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,520
the same month as the world's descent into lockdown.

451
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,940
With everyone stuck at home, the streaming industry exploded.

452
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,600
It's awkward to talk about in the context of a tragedy,

453
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,840
but the honest truth is that our bundle promotion

454
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,200
was selling faster than ever,

455
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,120
and creators were earning a lot.

456
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
CuriosityStream capitalized on industry momentum

457
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,980
by listing on NASDAQ through a SPAC merger in October,

458
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,480
which was initially a big success.

459
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,320
Day one ended with an 11% gain,

460
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,160
and they peaked in February 2021

461
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,320
at nearly double their first day price.

462
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,200
Through and through, the Nebula bundle was a win-win.

463
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,400
It grew Nebula, it grew CuriosityStream,

464
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,080
it grew creator sponsor payouts,

465
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,120
and it was a worthwhile proposition for all.

466
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,540
So we decided to double down

467
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,380
on aligning the success of the two companies

468
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,380
by, for the first time ever, accepting investment.

469
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,280
Now, investment had long been something we were wary of.

470
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,740
In our view, a big reason why similar business models

471
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,820
had failed in the past was because investors

472
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,100
pressured the streaming platforms

473
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,880
to squeeze more and more value out of creators.

474
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,180
Basically, they did the thing that seemed right

475
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,780
when you looked at it on a slide deck,

476
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,300
take a bigger share of the revenue, make more money.

477
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,420
But that fails to understand that the creators drive

478
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,480
almost all of the value of a platform like Nebula.

479
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,800
If they're making good money,

480
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,160
they'll make more exclusive content for audiences,

481
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,560
they'll bring their creator friends in,

482
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,120
they'll keep promoting the platform.

483
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,880
So it's really that if you take a smaller slice of the pie

484
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,560
and give more to creators,

485
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,720
the pie will grow so much in the long term

486
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,860
that the platform will make more overall.

487
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,160
Every dollar a streaming platform like Nebula makes

488
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,520
is through the creators,

489
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,920
so it's about creating that win-win scenario

490
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,840
rather than trying to extract value

491
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,400
from your business partners.

492
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,400
We weren't confident that most investors,

493
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
especially institutional investors,

494
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,840
would understand that and the other nuanced dynamics

495
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,880
of the creator industry in the long run,

496
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,420
with one exception, CuriosityStream.

497
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,660
Their people seemed to get it.

498
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,340
They were also, by far, our biggest marketing partner,

499
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,740
biggest production partner.

500
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,900
We'd already aligned ourselves with them so deeply

501
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,220
that investment seemed like a minor additional level

502
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,860
that would yield a lot of cash

503
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,580
to reinvest in growing Nebula.

504
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,540
So after a unanimous vote by myself and the other owners,

505
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,340
Nebula no longer was entirely ours.

506
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,000
While the exact numbers are not public,

507
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,720
what is is that they bought a significant minority stake

508
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,840
that valued Nebula,

509
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,080
the company that did not exist just three years prior,

510
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
at over $50 million.

511
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,660
Incredible.

512
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,760
Driven by this funding,

513
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,760
2022 was comprised of some of our fastest growth to date,

514
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,220
especially as shows like Real Life Lore's Modern Conflicts

515
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,040
and Our Jetlag the Game proved massively successful

516
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,440
at driving huge numbers of subscriptions.

517
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,600
Staff had count ballooned,

518
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,160
especially in the engineering department,

519
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,480
as they staffed up to build apps for new platforms

520
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,300
like Roku and Samsung TV.

521
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,780
We also finally had the money

522
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,380
to build our own streaming tech,

523
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,580
which freed us from some of the technical limitations

524
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,020
of Zype's white label offering.

525
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:31,940
And we geared up to produce

526
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,100
our most ambitious slate of originals to date

527
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
with the co-production funding CuriosityStream would provide.

528
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,040
But this is a good chance to acknowledge failure.

529
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,820
Now, failure is inevitable in business.

530
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,540
It's truly part of the process.

531
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,460
You try new things carefully,

532
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,980
and success is defined by your batting average.

533
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,440
If you win more than you lose, you're winning.

534
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,840
Nebula classes, however,

535
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,600
probably pulled down that batting average.

536
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,920
It sounded like a great idea at the time.

537
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,120
Through COVID, creators were earning massively

538
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,600
by making online classes.

539
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,220
We were constantly approached by various class platforms

540
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,880
who wanted to sponsor our creators,

541
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,280
and so rather than promoting their services,

542
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,760
we thought it better to build it into Nebula

543
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,400
so we could promote our own service

544
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,040
and keep all the customer revenue in the ecosystem.

545
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,960
In all honesty, we were trying to capitalize

546
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,640
on a wave of popularity that was relatively aligned

547
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,980
to what we were already doing.

548
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,460
Unlike when we launched Nebula as a whole,

549
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,740
we had a good amount of cash on hand to invest in this

550
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,380
thanks to CuriosityStream's investment,

551
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,860
so we wanted to launch strong.

552
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,980
We built out a section of the website and apps for it,

553
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,180
we built the backend tech to allow for multiple tiers

554
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,700
of membership, and we invested a lot in content.

555
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,580
We launched with six classes, and each was high quality,

556
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,940
shot in a studio in New York,

557
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,100
well-edited with motion graphics and everything.

558
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,220
That's to say, they weren't cheap.

559
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,400
We then planned to release a new one each week,

560
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,980
which meant organizing a dense production schedule.

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,520
It was a massively complex, large-scale undertaking,

562
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,160
but the engineering and production staff

563
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,960
made it all happen without a hitch.

564
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,880
The problem was that the concept

565
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,680
just wasn't resonating with customers.

566
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,120
We initially sold Nebula classes

567
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,680
as an additional tier above normal Nebula.

568
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,520
It was $100 a year by itself,

569
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,560
or a $5 a month upcharge for existing subscribers,

570
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,920
which might seem like a lot,

571
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,600
but was actually lower than competitors

572
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,860
with similar production quality.

573
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,440
We ran sponsorships on this and had some minor wins,

574
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,080
but on average, there was clearly audience confusion

575
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,820
as we also ran bundle sponsorships

576
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,140
on the same channels at different times.

577
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,100
We couldn't promote classes and bundle sponsorships

578
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,620
as classes weren't part of the bundle,

579
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,100
so in a way, we were competing against ourselves and losing.

580
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,300
Some people were upgrading.

581
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,940
It wasn't some massive failure,

582
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,380
but hardly enough to justify our rate of production.

583
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,540
Ultimately, creators could improve sponsorship performance

584
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,140
more by making Nebula originals,

585
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,260
so that's what they would do.

586
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,420
It was also clear that by the time we launched,

587
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,900
we were on the downslope of the online classes wave.

588
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,800
We were far from the only class platform

589
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,120
struggling to find product market fit,

590
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,260
so ultimately, we decided it best to just have one Nebula.

591
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,600
No upcharge for classes.

592
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
We'd make it available to all subscribers

593
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,640
and simply slow down our production calendar.

594
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,200
It was an important experiment,

595
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,160
and while not a direct, overwhelming success,

596
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,600
in a way, the marketing test we did for it

597
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,840
proved crucial for what was to come,

598
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,560
our biggest, most existential experiment to date.

599
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,680
Come late 2022, as indicated in their quarterly reports,

600
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,940
CuriosityStream was looking to pull back their growth rate

601
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,940
and orient more towards profitability.

602
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,320
COVID was dying down, screen time was lowering,

603
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,420
the streaming industry overall was weakening,

604
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,900
and so it made every sense in the world

605
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,780
for them to switch from a growth orientation

606
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,300
to a profit orientation,

607
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,780
as all growth-oriented companies that survive eventually do.

608
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,100
I assume for these reasons we got

609
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,940
were that they wanted to significantly pull back

610
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,900
on marketing spend through Nebula bundle sponsorships.

611
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,540
Clearly, this wasn't something we wanted.

612
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,700
Not only would it slow Nebula's growth rate,

613
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,260
but more crucially, it would reduce how much

614
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,840
we could pay creators to talk about Nebula on YouTube.

615
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,920
This was still the primary way

616
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,520
creators were earning through Nebula.

617
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,240
While watch time payouts and originals were significant,

618
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,520
payouts for YouTube sponsorships about Nebula

619
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,960
were far more so.

620
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,240
So the natural next question to ask was,

621
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,760
could we just do sponsorships ourselves?

622
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,720
You'll notice that nearly everything advertised

623
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,600
in a sponsorship at the end of a YouTube video

624
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,520
is an online subscription-based service.

625
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,640
For some reason or another, these are just what works best,

626
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,340
and here's how those advertising campaigns

627
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,900
work in the background.

628
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,420
Let's say a service costs $10 a month.

629
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,240
Every service has data on how long

630
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,040
the average subscriber sticks around.

631
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,780
Let's say it's 27 months.

632
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,780
That means the average lifetime value of a signup is $270.

633
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,800
It might actually cost, say, $5 a month to run that service,

634
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,220
meaning per month there's $5 left.

635
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,260
A good bit of that has to go to actually getting

636
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,820
the customers in the first place, to marketing.

637
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,180
Knowing there's $135 left in the average lifetime value,

638
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,840
the company will decide on a target

639
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,280
average cost per acquisition.

640
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,660
Let's say it's $75, leaving $60 in lifetime value

641
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,240
for profit that can be reinvested in platform growth

642
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,800
or just taken as profit.

643
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,280
Now that $75 target cost per acquisition

644
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,680
acts as the central success metric for marketing,

645
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,400
and when an agency designs a campaign

646
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,740
with creators pushing the service,

647
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,320
their payment will be designed in the background

648
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,440
by this number.

649
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,360
If, on average, they drive 100 signups per video,

650
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,120
their pay will be roughly $7,500 per video,

651
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,380
and either the agency or the service itself

652
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,160
will evaluate spots as they run

653
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
to make sure the long-term average cost

654
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,400
ends up at or below $75.

655
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,600
This works quite well.

656
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,120
The only issue is when that $75 needs to get paid.

657
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,240
Here, right when the customer signs up.

658
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,560
But on the company's side,

659
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,960
after the $5 in monthly operating expenses,

660
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,040
it's going to take 15 months for them

661
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,360
to capture that $75 back in revenue.

662
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,420
You essentially need to spend $75

663
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,400
to eventually earn that $60 in profits.

664
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,220
Put another way, you need to invest it.

665
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,740
This is the role of investors in these startups.

666
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,220
Companies can have an entirely viable business model,

667
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,780
but just need more cash in the bank

668
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,900
to pay for the marketing that leads to growth.

669
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,580
We didn't want to take more investments.

670
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,500
We didn't want to give up more ownership of the company.

671
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,060
So the question was,

672
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,380
could we use the couple million we had in the bank

673
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,060
to kickstart growth at a fast enough rate?

674
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,780
We were sure we had a viable business model.

675
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,800
We had years of proof that we could get a customer

676
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,940
through YouTube sponsorship

677
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,540
for less than their average lifetime value.

678
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,680
The question was when that cost per acquisition

679
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
was recaptured.

680
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,760
If it was quick, in the first year or so,

681
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,000
we were in business.

682
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,540
The math worked out that we could maintain

683
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,800
or even grow our monthly marketing spend

684
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,680
if we would recapture revenue fast enough

685
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,400
to reinvest it in new marketing.

686
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
If it was slower,

687
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,860
if we didn't recapture target cost per acquisition

688
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,360
until far in the future,

689
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,840
the careful balance that had made Nebula work

690
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,120
or so many close equivalents failed,

691
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,360
could all come crumbling down.

692
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,520
Today, we're five months on

693
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,300
from the switch to direct marketing ends.

694
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,580
I won't breathe the lead.

695
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,940
It went off better than our wildest expectations.

696
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,820
Crucially, over 80% of signups are opting to pay

697
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,500
for the annual subscription rather than the monthly one.

698
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,620
Considering we pay creators for Nebula sponsorships

699
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,220
the day after they go out,

700
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,980
that means we actually get a year's worth of revenue

701
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,100
before we even pay for the promotion.

702
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,500
In this case, that entirely eliminated

703
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,580
the cashflow constraint

704
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,460
because we make more day one on an average signup

705
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,180
than our average cost to acquire a new customer.

706
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,320
Of course, that doesn't mean we turn a day one profit,

707
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,400
we have operating costs beyond marketing,

708
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
but it means we have a marketing strategy

709
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,880
that could theoretically expand basically infinitely

710
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
zero cashflow limitations.

711
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,120
In just a few short months,

712
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,560
we went from spending $0 to more than half a million dollars

713
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,600
on marketing per month,

714
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,120
and we are earning back more than that in the same month.

715
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,440
I can't stress enough how incredible this is.

716
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,840
We, the creators, are now entirely in control

717
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,380
of our own future.

718
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,380
With this, we're charting our most ambitious slate

719
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,060
of originals to date, we're bringing in new creators,

720
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,660
we're investing in our tech.

721
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,620
There is so, so much that this big risk has unlocked.

722
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,300
Right now, it feels like the last couple of years

723
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,980
have been an overwhelming success,

724
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,180
but I truly believe that, looking back,

725
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,460
we'll consider 2023 much like we see 2019,

726
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,260
the turning point that makes previous success

727
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,180
the backstory you just have to get through

728
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,300
to get to the good part.

729
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,540
We have learned so much,

730
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,040
so now we understand what people want

731
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,880
and we have a company configured to offer that.

732
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,440
I truly cannot wait to show you what we can do.

733
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,920
Now I need to do thank yous.

734
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,640
When describing Nebula's history like this,

735
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,520
it feels like its success was defined by decisions.

736
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
And while partially true,

737
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,200
those decisions could only lead to anything

738
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,880
thanks to the sum of small collective actions

739
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,980
made by dozens, hundreds, thousands of people.

740
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,240
First and foremost, the staff of Nebula and Standard.

741
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,020
Unlike us creators, they do not get the public recognition

742
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,100
for what they do.

743
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,100
They pour their passion into servicing our passion,

744
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,700
working day in and day out to build a system

745
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,580
that allows us to do more of what we love to do.

746
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,700
Nebula truly could not exist without them.

747
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,820
Us creators could not exist without them.

748
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,620
So I'm endlessly grateful for the work they do.

749
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,980
Second, the creators.

750
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,180
The community that has risen out of Nebula and Standard

751
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,860
is just incredible.

752
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,940
Every day we talk, celebrating our wins,

753
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,260
commiserating our failures,

754
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,320
searching for solutions to problems.

755
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,600
We go to conferences together.

756
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,840
We go on vacation together.

757
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,120
We go to each other's weddings

758
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,960
and we'll be at each other's funerals.

759
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,000
I truly don't know if I could have navigated

760
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
the stresses of life as a creator without them.

761
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,880
And I know Nebula would have failed

762
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,320
without our collective vision for a brighter future

763
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,680
for the creator economy.

764
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,160
Lastly, the subscribers.

765
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,680
I could never have imagined that people would look at Nebula

766
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
as anything more than a company,

767
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,040
something trying to separate them from their dollars.

768
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,160
But I was wrong.

769
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,060
There is an unbelievable community of people

770
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,740
who not only use Nebula,

771
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:35,300
but have latched onto the same vision we have.

772
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,260
They celebrate our wins and help show us

773
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,820
where we can go stronger.

774
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,900
I'm constantly in awe of how much forgiveness they gave us

775
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,380
for scrappiness on our bootstrapped early days.

776
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,300
And we could not have come to today without that.

777
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,580
Thank you for taking a risk on us.

778
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,040
I hope we proved it worthwhile.

779
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,860
And I promise that we'll only work harder

780
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,180
to make that even more so in the future.

781
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,300
To close out,

782
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,660
I had to pay for the production costs on this video somehow.

783
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,000
And it kind of felt weird to make it feel even more

784
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,240
like a big, long Nebula ad

785
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
by putting a Nebula sponsorship at the end.

786
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,360
And it felt even more weird

787
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,960
to put another sponsor at the end.

788
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
So I'm going to go with the less weird weird option,

789
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,560
but keep it simple.

790
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,840
If you aren't subscribed to Nebula,

791
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,040
but want to check it out, use our link.

792
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,720
Nebula.tv slash Wendover.

793
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,080
You'll get $20 off an annual subscription,

794
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,440
bringing the cost down to just $2 and 50 cents a month.

795
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,400
Thank you for caring enough to listen to this story.

796
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,320
It's a wild one.

797
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
And I hope in a few years

798
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,780
we have an even better one to tell you.

799
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,620
Thanks to you.
