WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.540
I remember exactly where I was.

00:03.540 --> 00:05.380
Sydney International Airport waded into board

00:05.380 --> 00:06.680
a 10-hour flight to Tokyo,

00:06.680 --> 00:08.340
followed by a 12-hour flight to Boston,

00:08.340 --> 00:10.580
then a one-hour one to D.C. to arrive home

00:10.580 --> 00:12.780
the day before Thanksgiving, 2018.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.380
My agent Dave said he had an idea he wanted to run past me,

00:15.380 --> 00:16.980
so he popped on a call.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.620
He had just talked to Vimeo, the video streaming platform.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.100
They were trying to persuade him to persuade

00:21.100 --> 00:23.420
one of his other clients to build a paywall streaming site

00:23.420 --> 00:25.300
for their videos using their tech.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.640
This, and infinite minor variations of this,

00:27.640 --> 00:29.900
was something we'd get pitched constantly as creators,

00:29.900 --> 00:33.100
but everyone recognized that it couldn't really work.

00:33.100 --> 00:36.300
In fact, it had a long history of not working.

00:36.300 --> 00:38.540
Perhaps the most flashy failure was Vessel.

00:38.540 --> 00:39.780
It launched in early 2015

00:39.780 --> 00:41.480
with the big-name creators of the time.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.180
Good Mythical Morning, Epic Meal Time,

00:43.180 --> 00:45.080
Shane Dawson, Linus Tech Tips.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.660
It was basically a YouTube replacement.

00:46.660 --> 00:48.680
Same content, same creators, same features,

00:48.680 --> 00:51.060
with the addition that users could pay $2.99 a month

00:51.060 --> 00:53.000
to watch videos 72 hours early.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.900
Combine that with their supposedly unique

00:54.900 --> 00:57.220
advertising ecosystem, and the pitch to creators

00:57.220 --> 00:59.300
was that they could earn dramatically more per view.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.400
This is always the core proposition

01:01.400 --> 01:03.040
with these alternate streaming services.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.200
More revenue per view,

01:04.200 --> 01:07.240
but they almost always have the same problem.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.880
The number of views is orders of magnitude lower.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.580
Platforms have to extract value from the audience somehow,

01:13.580 --> 01:14.840
whether through a paywall or through

01:14.840 --> 01:16.280
more intrusive advertising.

01:16.280 --> 01:18.120
So why would a viewer watch on your platform

01:18.120 --> 01:20.560
when they could watch the exact same content on YouTube

01:20.560 --> 01:23.420
for free and with less intrusive advertising?

01:23.420 --> 01:25.420
So creators signed on to platforms like Vessel,

01:25.420 --> 01:26.960
get menial views compared to YouTube,

01:26.960 --> 01:28.600
and before these platforms can grow enough

01:28.600 --> 01:29.760
to get to a point where it's worth it

01:29.760 --> 01:31.540
for creators beyond an initial test group,

01:31.540 --> 01:33.500
they run out of money and shut down.

01:33.500 --> 01:36.060
But we had some ideas on how we could fix that.

01:36.060 --> 01:39.040
We thought there was a chance that we had identified

01:39.040 --> 01:42.300
a magic formula that we were in a uniquely good position

01:42.300 --> 01:45.220
to undertake that could make this simple concept work

01:45.220 --> 01:47.680
where all others had failed.

01:47.680 --> 01:51.520
Four years later, well, not to brag, but we were right.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.820
Nebula has grown massively.

01:53.820 --> 01:58.020
Over 650,000 paying users, 100 staff members,

01:58.680 --> 02:02.320
a conservative overall valuation of over $150 million,

02:02.320 --> 02:05.580
and it did all of that with absolutely zero dollars

02:05.580 --> 02:07.320
of venture capital funding.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.760
So what did we do different?

02:08.760 --> 02:11.460
Why were we able to make this simple concept work

02:11.460 --> 02:13.520
when all others had failed?

02:13.520 --> 02:16.160
Clearly this video is going to be different.

02:16.160 --> 02:18.700
I'm not gonna be talking about logistics or geopolitics

02:18.700 --> 02:20.700
or infrastructure or another business.

02:20.700 --> 02:22.240
I'm talking about my business.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.140
So that's why, for the first time, I'm here.

02:25.140 --> 02:26.880
This was a tricky video to write.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.440
I'm trying to use my unique combination of positions

02:29.440 --> 02:32.280
as an owner of a now sizable business and as a creator

02:32.280 --> 02:34.200
to tell an intimate inside story

02:34.200 --> 02:37.680
of how you can grow an idea into an enterprise.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.180
There are a lot of things that can't be said

02:39.180 --> 02:40.640
for legal or practical reasons,

02:40.640 --> 02:42.920
and there are countless different stakeholders involved.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.560
So what follows is what I believe is the fullest story

02:45.560 --> 02:48.060
anyone can tell about the inside operations

02:48.060 --> 02:49.760
of a business of this size and nature,

02:49.760 --> 02:51.260
but there are, unfortunately,

02:51.260 --> 02:53.020
some things I just can't talk about.

02:53.020 --> 02:56.160
It's a long story, but it begins in a very small way.

02:56.180 --> 02:57.920
On July 27th, 2016,

02:57.920 --> 03:01.220
I got this DM from Philip Detmer of Curse Protect.

03:01.220 --> 03:02.820
Hey man, let's get right to it.

03:02.820 --> 03:04.980
So me and another big YouTuber might be starting something,

03:04.980 --> 03:06.860
but I can't really talk about it yet.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.960
We went back and forth for a month trying to schedule a call,

03:08.960 --> 03:10.100
then finally we talked.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.060
Basically, Philip was going to introduce me

03:12.060 --> 03:13.700
to the freelance sponsorship agent

03:13.700 --> 03:16.360
he and CGP Grey had been working with for years,

03:16.360 --> 03:18.960
and later that might turn into something bigger.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.200
That freelance sponsorship agent was Dave Whiskas.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.300
That's a name you'll want to remember.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.840
It's pretty relevant throughout.

03:24.860 --> 03:26.660
We talked, he promised better rates

03:26.660 --> 03:28.860
through a data-driven approach with an upfront commission.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.140
I somehow believed him,

03:30.140 --> 03:33.060
but eventually it turned out he was actually right.

03:33.060 --> 03:34.500
Some important context.

03:34.500 --> 03:37.800
The industry that had arisen around YouTube creators in 2016

03:37.800 --> 03:40.640
was chock full of liars, cheats, and thieves.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.860
It was only over the prior couple of years

03:41.860 --> 03:43.700
that people could start to make a living off of YouTube,

03:43.700 --> 03:44.820
and seemingly the first people

03:44.820 --> 03:46.420
that thought to insert themselves as middlemen

03:46.420 --> 03:48.480
were all glorified grifters.

03:48.480 --> 03:51.140
Getting sponsored is crucial to going full-time on YouTube.

03:51.140 --> 03:52.720
AdSense alone rarely cuts it,

03:52.720 --> 03:54.580
so at the time, the only deals I could land

03:54.580 --> 03:56.040
for my fledgling channel were ones

03:56.040 --> 03:58.980
that automatically locked me into six months of exclusivity

03:58.980 --> 04:00.460
with the agency I booked through

04:00.460 --> 04:03.680
without any guarantee they would actually fill video inventory

04:03.680 --> 04:05.460
and with undisclosed commissions.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.720
Undisclosed commissions in this context

04:07.720 --> 04:10.580
means they just told you exactly what you'd get paid,

04:10.580 --> 04:12.680
which sounds great in theory, but in practice,

04:12.680 --> 04:14.340
what it means is that they're selling the slot

04:14.340 --> 04:15.980
to the sponsor for one price,

04:15.980 --> 04:19.320
then paying you a completely different, lower price,

04:19.320 --> 04:21.020
and never telling you what the difference was.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.960
So just decide what they think you'll accept,

04:22.960 --> 04:24.320
but you have little leverage to say no,

04:24.320 --> 04:27.120
because once again, you're locked into exclusivity.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.480
You're only legally allowed to work with them.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.920
Oh, and also, contractually,

04:30.920 --> 04:32.840
they represented the sponsor, not the creator,

04:32.840 --> 04:34.320
so their incentives were to push the price

04:34.320 --> 04:35.440
as low as it could go.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.040
If you didn't like it and wanted to jump ship,

04:37.040 --> 04:39.000
you had to go without sponsorship for six months,

04:39.000 --> 04:40.760
which would kill your finances.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.840
I've seen hard evidence that this particular agency

04:42.840 --> 04:45.400
was taking a 50% undisclosed commission

04:45.400 --> 04:46.760
on certain creator sponsorships,

04:46.760 --> 04:48.560
so it's no wonder why Dave was able

04:48.560 --> 04:49.960
to immediately beat their rates

04:49.980 --> 04:51.660
and get sponsors to come back.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.280
They might have actually been paying less,

04:53.280 --> 04:55.900
but I, the creator, was getting more hit.

04:55.900 --> 04:58.140
By chance, Gray and Philip had also introduced Dave

04:58.140 --> 04:59.540
to Brian from Real Engineering.

04:59.540 --> 05:01.140
We had collaborated on a set of videos

05:01.140 --> 05:02.660
that turned out to be big viral hits

05:02.660 --> 05:04.700
that launched both of our channels into relevancy,

05:04.700 --> 05:06.740
so he was one of my first creator friends.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.060
The next one was Joseph from RealLifeLore.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.740
I had never met him in person, but we had talked plenty,

05:11.740 --> 05:12.960
so I convinced him to fly out

05:12.960 --> 05:16.380
to the inaugural VidCon Europe in Amsterdam in April 2017.

05:16.380 --> 05:18.140
Part of the reason was because I had been nagging Dave

05:18.140 --> 05:19.580
for months to work with Joseph,

05:20.120 --> 05:22.400
whose channel was exploding, and Dave would be there too,

05:22.400 --> 05:24.120
the perfect opportunity for them to meet.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.920
Joseph ended up having a nightmare weekend

05:25.920 --> 05:28.360
of travel delays, some snowstorm or something,

05:28.360 --> 05:29.340
so he didn't end up getting there

05:29.340 --> 05:31.240
until the afternoon of the last day,

05:31.240 --> 05:33.520
but I introduced everyone and we headed to a bar.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.720
We stayed there for hours.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
Everyone hit it off,

05:35.720 --> 05:38.040
and it capped off an exhilarating week out,

05:38.040 --> 05:40.740
the first time any of us had seen a physical manifestation

05:40.740 --> 05:42.920
of the industry we had inserted ourselves into.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.160
After working in isolation, it was eye-opening

05:45.160 --> 05:46.880
to see and talk to so many others

05:46.880 --> 05:49.520
doing the same thing as us, and according to Dave,

05:50.340 --> 05:53.060
in retrospect, this was the moment when he fully realized

05:53.060 --> 05:56.140
that this informal system of freelance sponsorship booking

05:56.140 --> 05:58.700
could grow into something more.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.080
It'd be called Standard, a purposely forgettable name

06:01.080 --> 06:03.380
for a company designed to exist in the background,

06:03.380 --> 06:06.220
making life easier for the creators on center stage,

06:06.220 --> 06:07.060
and it worked.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.280
Creators were simply just having a better experience

06:09.280 --> 06:10.460
working with Standard.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.740
The rates were strong, the experience was personal,

06:12.740 --> 06:15.460
the ethos ethical, in a landscape filled with grifters

06:15.460 --> 06:17.980
and cheats, the concept of a sponsorship agency

06:17.980 --> 06:19.680
simply doing its job fairly

06:19.680 --> 06:22.280
was enough to drive natural word-of-mouth growth.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.060
We added dozens of creators to the roster

06:24.060 --> 06:26.560
and started to be viewed as the go-to agency

06:26.560 --> 06:27.800
for educational YouTube.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.480
We hired staff, got an office,

06:29.480 --> 06:31.960
started throwing VidCon parties, it was all happening.

06:31.960 --> 06:34.480
Unbelievably, this part, the part that at the time

06:34.480 --> 06:37.080
felt like hard-earned yet incredible success,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.760
needs to get glossed over to get to the good part,

06:39.760 --> 06:41.920
November 27th, 2018.

06:41.920 --> 06:43.400
After a couple of days of back and forth

06:43.400 --> 06:45.000
with myself and a few other creators,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.440
that's when Dave emailed his full roster of creators

06:47.440 --> 06:49.580
the white paper, the initial concept

06:49.580 --> 06:51.540
laying out our vision for Nebula.

06:51.540 --> 06:54.380
This is that exact email.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.860
In some ways, it was close.

06:55.860 --> 06:56.880
How would this work?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.140
Standard creators post ad and sponsor-free versions

06:59.140 --> 07:00.620
of their videos, and occasionally

07:00.620 --> 07:02.420
the service premieres exclusive content.

07:02.420 --> 07:05.660
Let's say we charge users $5 per month for their service.

07:05.660 --> 07:08.300
All of this is still true to this day, even the price.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.420
In other ways, we were way off.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.780
How do we attract viewers?

07:11.780 --> 07:14.940
First, we can simply buy AdSense ads on Standard channels.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.200
Sponsoring our own creators feels wrong, at least for now.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.240
We can revisit it later if we think we can do it

07:20.240 --> 07:21.120
without looking dumb.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.960
This is about as wrong as it could be.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.360
We have never figured out how to make AdSense marketing

07:25.360 --> 07:27.640
for Nebula profitable, while sponsoring YouTube creators

07:27.640 --> 07:29.800
has been the driving growth force.

07:29.800 --> 07:31.200
We'll get to how we made that work.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.800
But the real key that we understood from day one

07:33.800 --> 07:35.520
was that opportunity cost.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.800
To Standard, but especially to creators,

07:37.800 --> 07:41.240
had to be as small as it could possibly be.

07:41.240 --> 07:43.720
Equivalents before us always raised a huge amount

07:43.740 --> 07:46.420
of venture capital funding, made a big splash at launch,

07:46.420 --> 07:48.180
and ran out of money before profitability,

07:48.180 --> 07:50.500
leaving creators embarrassed when they folded.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.540
We knew that creators were wary of aligning themselves

07:52.540 --> 07:56.380
to something so risky, so we needed to make a small splash.

07:56.380 --> 07:59.340
We needed to design Nebula to fail gracefully.

07:59.340 --> 08:01.540
We needed to make it so that if it did fail,

08:01.540 --> 08:03.940
it would have the smallest possible impact

08:03.940 --> 08:06.180
on reputation and finances.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.100
Essentially, we followed the most dramatic form

08:08.100 --> 08:10.580
of the minimum viable product model of innovation.

08:10.580 --> 08:13.140
We needed to get a super scrappy version of the product

08:13.680 --> 08:15.800
out into the public so that rather than us having to guess,

08:15.800 --> 08:18.360
they, the customers, would tell us what they wanted

08:18.360 --> 08:19.800
through how they acted.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.480
You watch consumer behavior in order to fulfill their wants.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.800
Luckily, a lot of the bones were already in place.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.240
Dave's prior life was in the iOS app development world,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.520
so he had a lot of experience in software.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.280
We actually had a few engineers on staff

08:31.280 --> 08:33.640
to work on the backend tool we use for sponsor billing

08:33.640 --> 08:35.160
and inventory management.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.080
The trickiest bit would be the actual streaming.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.720
The big platforms like YouTube and Netflix

08:39.720 --> 08:42.800
make it look easy, but it's quite a technical challenge

08:43.340 --> 08:45.740
to distribute high-quality video on low-quality internet

08:45.740 --> 08:47.700
all across the globe, and we didn't possibly

08:47.700 --> 08:49.320
have the money to build our own streaming tech.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.220
Of course, Vimeo originally approached us,

08:51.220 --> 08:52.580
but the problem with partnering with them

08:52.580 --> 08:55.100
was that they'd have owned the billing relationship.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.700
Basically, when someone signed up,

08:56.700 --> 08:58.700
Vimeo would keep their credit card details and info,

08:58.700 --> 09:00.220
and while we'd get the money,

09:00.220 --> 09:01.820
if we ever decided to split with them,

09:01.820 --> 09:04.300
there was no guarantee we'd keep the subscribers.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.500
So we'd rather decided to partner

09:05.500 --> 09:07.620
with another streaming provider called Zype.

09:07.620 --> 09:09.940
Therefore, all we had to build was a front end,

09:09.940 --> 09:11.700
a slick, flashy user interface

09:11.720 --> 09:14.200
to make it all look professional, and an iOS app.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.800
We barely even had a backend.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.140
We had Eric, who doubled as our podcast editor,

09:18.140 --> 09:19.580
who would take the videos creators added

09:19.580 --> 09:21.800
to a shared Dropbox folder, run them through the encoder,

09:21.800 --> 09:24.560
and post them in the right spot with the right metadata.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.640
All in all, it cost around $100,000

09:26.640 --> 09:28.080
to get Nebula ready for launch,

09:28.080 --> 09:31.200
an incredibly low sum for both the website and app,

09:31.200 --> 09:34.000
but there was still one key thing we were missing.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.400
You see, creators don't talk unless they're paid to.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.440
This is because creators are paid to talk.

09:40.460 --> 09:41.660
It's just pragmatic.

09:41.660 --> 09:43.660
You basically get one call to action per video.

09:43.660 --> 09:45.020
You're lucky to successfully get someone

09:45.020 --> 09:46.500
to listen to one call to action,

09:46.500 --> 09:48.980
so what the data shows is that if a creator, for example,

09:48.980 --> 09:51.220
runs a sponsor read, then promotes their Patreon,

09:51.220 --> 09:52.700
what they'll see on average

09:52.700 --> 09:54.200
is that they'll earn less overall

09:54.200 --> 09:55.940
than if they had just promoted the sponsor

09:55.940 --> 09:58.820
as the Patreon push cuts into performance more

09:58.820 --> 10:00.380
than it drives additional revenue.

10:00.380 --> 10:01.460
It's not always intuitive,

10:01.460 --> 10:03.060
but it's a quirk of audience behavior

10:03.060 --> 10:04.360
that we'd understood for years

10:04.360 --> 10:05.760
running sponsorships in standard.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.260
Therefore, we knew we couldn't just simply ask creators

10:08.260 --> 10:10.380
to promote Nebula out of the goodness of their arms.

10:10.380 --> 10:11.960
Not only would this hurt their revenue,

10:11.960 --> 10:13.280
which would mean they would stop working

10:13.280 --> 10:14.520
with Nebula in the long run,

10:14.520 --> 10:16.080
this would hurt standards revenue, too,

10:16.080 --> 10:18.360
since it came from commission on sponsorships.

10:18.360 --> 10:19.800
At the time, Standard and Nebula

10:19.800 --> 10:21.320
were literally the same company

10:21.320 --> 10:23.040
with zero legal separation,

10:23.040 --> 10:25.680
so weirdly, free promotion for Nebula

10:25.680 --> 10:27.040
would cut off the revenue source

10:27.040 --> 10:29.640
that we were using to build Nebula.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.980
We didn't immediately have a solution to this.

10:31.980 --> 10:34.560
In all honesty, this was the biggest flaw

10:34.560 --> 10:36.320
with the business model at launch.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.480
But again, the launch was designed to be an experiment,

10:38.480 --> 10:40.320
designed to be that minimum viable product.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.360
We didn't necessarily need a big marketing method

10:42.360 --> 10:43.900
at launch because the launch was designed

10:43.900 --> 10:45.140
to help us find that,

10:45.140 --> 10:46.660
so the last piece that we needed

10:46.660 --> 10:49.780
was for the creators to be emotionally invested.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.500
Everyone was excited by the concept,

10:51.500 --> 10:53.360
but to assure people would stay excited

10:53.360 --> 10:55.600
through the inevitably difficult early days,

10:55.600 --> 10:58.640
well, we figured they might as well be financially invested.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.620
So, through complex financial and legal wizardry,

11:01.620 --> 11:04.260
we developed a system where 50% of Nebula profits

11:04.260 --> 11:07.620
were distributed to creators, including, crucially,

11:07.620 --> 11:09.820
if the platform were ever to be sold.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.920
It means if one day the platform were to sell for,

11:11.920 --> 11:13.520
let's say, a billion dollars,

11:13.520 --> 11:15.160
the creators would get half of that.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.720
We split that pool based on watch time,

11:16.720 --> 11:19.200
meaning the more creators bring in and engage an audience,

11:19.200 --> 11:20.700
the bigger a share they're entitled to.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.280
In the short term, this would be a concept

11:22.280 --> 11:24.160
that would keep creators building for the future.

11:24.160 --> 11:26.320
In the medium term, this would allocate profit to creators

11:26.320 --> 11:28.680
based on how much they contributed to growing that profit.

11:28.680 --> 11:31.000
And in the long term, if Nebula were ever to sell,

11:31.000 --> 11:33.200
this would make that a scenario where everyone wins,

11:33.200 --> 11:34.760
rather than one where the platform wins

11:34.760 --> 11:36.200
off the hard work of creators.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.500
Not only would this directly tie platform success

11:38.520 --> 11:40.440
to creator success and vice versa,

11:40.440 --> 11:42.880
it would also keep everyone in that collaborative mindset,

11:42.880 --> 11:45.360
one where Nebula and its creators were business partners,

11:45.360 --> 11:47.360
rather than clients and servicers.

11:47.360 --> 11:49.520
We win together, and we lose together.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.360
Next, launch.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.040
We didn't have some massive plan.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.760
The website had been up and running for a bit

11:54.760 --> 11:56.760
as we squashed bugs, so what really marked

11:56.760 --> 11:59.120
the formal launch, if anything did,

11:59.120 --> 12:01.280
was the first public promotion of the platform.

12:01.280 --> 12:02.520
That came from Isaac Arthur.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.040
On the morning of Thursday, May 23rd, 2019,

12:05.040 --> 12:07.720
he released a video called Colonizing Black Holes,

12:07.740 --> 12:10.060
which ended with a push to his Nebula original,

12:10.060 --> 12:12.500
one of the first three called the Paperclip Maximizer.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.660
We also had originals that launched from real life lore,

12:14.660 --> 12:16.060
Second Thought, and Polyphonic,

12:16.060 --> 12:17.820
so we each released videos mentioning Nebula

12:17.820 --> 12:19.860
funded by a small and finite pool of money

12:19.860 --> 12:21.460
dedicated to launch promotion.

12:21.460 --> 12:22.620
This first weekend went better

12:22.620 --> 12:24.380
than we possibly could have hoped for.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.860
By Monday, we had over 4,500 signups.

12:26.860 --> 12:28.900
They were trial signups, plenty would cancel,

12:28.900 --> 12:31.220
but that gave us plenty enough data to work with

12:31.220 --> 12:33.140
to figure out how to make this all work.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.340
Better yet, we were getting buzz.

12:35.360 --> 12:37.200
A lot of it was negative.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.880
Almost everyone thought we'd get added

12:38.880 --> 12:41.400
to the long list of failed alternate streaming sites,

12:41.400 --> 12:43.600
but at the least, this told us that the idea

12:43.600 --> 12:46.460
was exciting enough that people cared to care about us.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.560
Over the following weeks and months,

12:47.560 --> 12:48.920
we used some of our cash on hand

12:48.920 --> 12:51.880
to run some very small additional marketing tests,

12:51.880 --> 12:53.880
basically seeing if we could pay creators

12:53.880 --> 12:55.720
a similar rate to their other sponsors

12:55.720 --> 12:57.380
and bring in enough subscribers

12:57.380 --> 12:59.080
to justify paying that much.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.480
The answers we got were promising.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.800
On one test we did on my podcast, Extremities,

13:03.820 --> 13:07.020
Nebula paid us $800 and got 200 signups,

13:07.020 --> 13:09.140
each of whom would pay $5 a month.

13:09.140 --> 13:11.820
The only problem, we didn't have cash.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.380
While we'd eventually generate cash

13:13.380 --> 13:15.540
with the monthly revenue these subscribers brought in,

13:15.540 --> 13:17.260
that'd be a very slow process,

13:17.260 --> 13:18.660
meaning it'd be quite a while

13:18.660 --> 13:20.900
until we could start sponsoring the larger YouTube channels

13:20.900 --> 13:22.900
and developing bigger Nebula originals.

13:22.900 --> 13:24.100
But we found a solution.

13:24.100 --> 13:27.460
Standard had long-run sponsorships for CuriosityStream.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.580
Another streaming service focused on documentary

13:29.580 --> 13:32.300
and non-fiction content founded by Jon Hendricks,

13:32.300 --> 13:33.200
the Discovery Channel.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.100
To their credit, they didn't get scared

13:35.100 --> 13:37.100
thinking creators were trying to replace them,

13:37.100 --> 13:38.900
but rather understood that we were appealing

13:38.900 --> 13:41.420
to a different, complementary market.

13:41.420 --> 13:43.780
So Dave went down to the offices just outside of DC

13:43.780 --> 13:46.300
and came out the other end with a win-win.

13:46.300 --> 13:47.380
We'd bundle.

13:47.380 --> 13:49.780
While I can't discuss the exact behind-the-scenes mechanics,

13:49.780 --> 13:52.140
we found a way to make it worthwhile for both companies

13:52.140 --> 13:54.620
so that when customers signed up for CuriosityStream

13:54.620 --> 13:56.540
through each creator's sponsorship links,

13:56.540 --> 13:58.980
they'd get access to Nebula for free.

13:58.980 --> 14:00.340
Nobody could really see a downside,

14:00.340 --> 14:02.740
so we negotiated details, signed a term sheet,

14:03.320 --> 14:05.320
and as of September 2019, every Nebula creator

14:05.320 --> 14:06.800
just started promoting the bundle

14:06.800 --> 14:09.120
in their already-booked CuriosityStream spots.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.800
In retrospect, it seems like a minor,

14:10.800 --> 14:15.040
ultimately easy change, but it yielded massive results.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.160
Personally, the bundle deal supercharged

14:17.160 --> 14:18.600
my sponsorship performance.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
It was clear that the offering of CuriosityStream

14:20.600 --> 14:22.480
and Nebula together was a more convincing sell

14:22.480 --> 14:24.400
to our audiences than any other sponsor

14:24.400 --> 14:25.300
we ran on the channel.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.140
Even better, we started to understand

14:27.140 --> 14:28.720
the marketing message that worked.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.040
Pushing to behind-the-scenes videos or extended cuts

14:31.060 --> 14:32.340
didn't really work.

14:32.340 --> 14:34.460
Pushing the idea of no ads or sponsorship

14:34.460 --> 14:37.460
on Nebula worked okay, but the thing that clearly created

14:37.460 --> 14:40.100
these performance multiples was full-length,

14:40.100 --> 14:42.860
high-budget, exclusive originals.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.500
Seeing that, CuriosityStream started

14:44.500 --> 14:46.460
to co-produce Nebula originals with us.

14:46.460 --> 14:49.060
In October 2019, to film our highest-budget,

14:49.060 --> 14:51.500
most ambitious one to date, I flew all the way

14:51.500 --> 14:53.580
to the remote Atlantic island of St. Helena

14:53.580 --> 14:55.860
to make the world's most useful airport.

14:55.860 --> 14:58.340
While I was there, we crossed 10,000 paying subscribers,

14:58.360 --> 15:01.240
then it took less than a month more to hit 20,000.

15:01.240 --> 15:04.040
By the end of the year, we had crossed 35,000,

15:04.040 --> 15:07.080
and in six short months, Nebula had transformed

15:07.080 --> 15:10.240
from an idea into a fast-growth startup.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.480
Now, through all this history,

15:11.480 --> 15:14.140
I was not actually an owner of Standard,

15:14.140 --> 15:16.400
just a highly involved long-term client,

15:16.400 --> 15:18.640
but it was clearly something I was interested in.

15:18.640 --> 15:20.960
I was there from the start, I had helped it grow,

15:20.960 --> 15:23.840
and I believed in it, and specifically Nebula's future.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.520
In 2020, an opportunity arose.

15:26.540 --> 15:28.860
Gray and Philip were less keen on Nebula.

15:28.860 --> 15:30.420
It seemed to make less sense to them,

15:30.420 --> 15:32.100
while the rest of the creator roster was,

15:32.100 --> 15:33.360
so they were looking for a way

15:33.360 --> 15:34.960
to end their involvement with the company.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.620
Therefore, Brian from Real Engineering,

15:36.620 --> 15:38.900
Alex from LowSpecGamer, Devin from Legal Eagle,

15:38.900 --> 15:40.380
Thomas Frank, and myself agreed

15:40.380 --> 15:41.940
to purchase their ownership stakes

15:41.940 --> 15:43.420
and divide it up amongst ourselves,

15:43.420 --> 15:46.140
and we were all extremely bullish on Nebula.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.900
By chance, that sale occurred in March 2020,

15:48.900 --> 15:51.520
the same month as the world's descent into lockdown.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.940
With everyone stuck at home, the streaming industry exploded.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.600
It's awkward to talk about in the context of a tragedy,

15:57.600 --> 15:59.840
but the honest truth is that our bundle promotion

15:59.840 --> 16:01.200
was selling faster than ever,

16:01.200 --> 16:03.120
and creators were earning a lot.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.120
CuriosityStream capitalized on industry momentum

16:05.120 --> 16:07.980
by listing on NASDAQ through a SPAC merger in October,

16:07.980 --> 16:09.480
which was initially a big success.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.320
Day one ended with an 11% gain,

16:11.320 --> 16:13.160
and they peaked in February 2021

16:13.160 --> 16:15.320
at nearly double their first day price.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.200
Through and through, the Nebula bundle was a win-win.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.400
It grew Nebula, it grew CuriosityStream,

16:20.400 --> 16:22.080
it grew creator sponsor payouts,

16:22.080 --> 16:24.120
and it was a worthwhile proposition for all.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.540
So we decided to double down

16:25.540 --> 16:27.380
on aligning the success of the two companies

16:27.380 --> 16:31.380
by, for the first time ever, accepting investment.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.280
Now, investment had long been something we were wary of.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.740
In our view, a big reason why similar business models

16:36.740 --> 16:38.820
had failed in the past was because investors

16:38.820 --> 16:40.100
pressured the streaming platforms

16:40.100 --> 16:42.880
to squeeze more and more value out of creators.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.180
Basically, they did the thing that seemed right

16:45.180 --> 16:46.780
when you looked at it on a slide deck,

16:46.780 --> 16:49.300
take a bigger share of the revenue, make more money.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.420
But that fails to understand that the creators drive

16:51.440 --> 16:54.480
almost all of the value of a platform like Nebula.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.800
If they're making good money,

16:55.800 --> 16:58.160
they'll make more exclusive content for audiences,

16:58.160 --> 16:59.560
they'll bring their creator friends in,

16:59.560 --> 17:01.120
they'll keep promoting the platform.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.880
So it's really that if you take a smaller slice of the pie

17:03.880 --> 17:05.560
and give more to creators,

17:05.560 --> 17:07.720
the pie will grow so much in the long term

17:07.720 --> 17:09.860
that the platform will make more overall.

17:09.860 --> 17:12.160
Every dollar a streaming platform like Nebula makes

17:12.160 --> 17:13.520
is through the creators,

17:13.520 --> 17:15.920
so it's about creating that win-win scenario

17:15.920 --> 17:17.840
rather than trying to extract value

17:17.840 --> 17:19.400
from your business partners.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.400
We weren't confident that most investors,

17:22.220 --> 17:23.220
especially institutional investors,

17:23.220 --> 17:25.840
would understand that and the other nuanced dynamics

17:25.840 --> 17:27.880
of the creator industry in the long run,

17:27.880 --> 17:30.420
with one exception, CuriosityStream.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.660
Their people seemed to get it.

17:32.660 --> 17:35.340
They were also, by far, our biggest marketing partner,

17:35.340 --> 17:36.740
biggest production partner.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.900
We'd already aligned ourselves with them so deeply

17:38.900 --> 17:41.220
that investment seemed like a minor additional level

17:41.220 --> 17:42.860
that would yield a lot of cash

17:42.860 --> 17:44.580
to reinvest in growing Nebula.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.540
So after a unanimous vote by myself and the other owners,

17:47.540 --> 17:51.340
Nebula no longer was entirely ours.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.000
While the exact numbers are not public,

17:53.000 --> 17:55.720
what is is that they bought a significant minority stake

17:55.720 --> 17:56.840
that valued Nebula,

17:56.840 --> 18:00.080
the company that did not exist just three years prior,

18:00.080 --> 18:02.880
at over $50 million.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.660
Incredible.

18:05.660 --> 18:06.760
Driven by this funding,

18:06.760 --> 18:09.760
2022 was comprised of some of our fastest growth to date,

18:09.760 --> 18:12.220
especially as shows like Real Life Lore's Modern Conflicts

18:12.220 --> 18:15.040
and Our Jetlag the Game proved massively successful

18:15.040 --> 18:17.440
at driving huge numbers of subscriptions.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.600
Staff had count ballooned,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.160
especially in the engineering department,

18:20.160 --> 18:22.480
as they staffed up to build apps for new platforms

18:22.480 --> 18:24.300
like Roku and Samsung TV.

18:24.300 --> 18:25.780
We also finally had the money

18:25.780 --> 18:27.380
to build our own streaming tech,

18:27.380 --> 18:29.580
which freed us from some of the technical limitations

18:29.580 --> 18:31.020
of Zype's white label offering.

18:31.020 --> 18:31.940
And we geared up to produce

18:31.940 --> 18:34.100
our most ambitious slate of originals to date

18:34.100 --> 18:37.100
with the co-production funding CuriosityStream would provide.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.040
But this is a good chance to acknowledge failure.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.820
Now, failure is inevitable in business.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.540
It's truly part of the process.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.460
You try new things carefully,

18:46.460 --> 18:48.980
and success is defined by your batting average.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.440
If you win more than you lose, you're winning.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.840
Nebula classes, however,

18:52.840 --> 18:55.600
probably pulled down that batting average.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.920
It sounded like a great idea at the time.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.120
Through COVID, creators were earning massively

19:00.120 --> 19:01.600
by making online classes.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.220
We were constantly approached by various class platforms

19:04.220 --> 19:05.880
who wanted to sponsor our creators,

19:05.880 --> 19:08.280
and so rather than promoting their services,

19:08.280 --> 19:09.760
we thought it better to build it into Nebula

19:09.760 --> 19:11.400
so we could promote our own service

19:11.400 --> 19:14.040
and keep all the customer revenue in the ecosystem.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.960
In all honesty, we were trying to capitalize

19:15.960 --> 19:18.640
on a wave of popularity that was relatively aligned

19:18.700 --> 19:19.980
to what we were already doing.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.460
Unlike when we launched Nebula as a whole,

19:21.460 --> 19:23.740
we had a good amount of cash on hand to invest in this

19:23.740 --> 19:25.380
thanks to CuriosityStream's investment,

19:25.380 --> 19:26.860
so we wanted to launch strong.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.980
We built out a section of the website and apps for it,

19:28.980 --> 19:31.180
we built the backend tech to allow for multiple tiers

19:31.180 --> 19:34.700
of membership, and we invested a lot in content.

19:34.700 --> 19:37.580
We launched with six classes, and each was high quality,

19:37.580 --> 19:38.940
shot in a studio in New York,

19:38.940 --> 19:41.100
well-edited with motion graphics and everything.

19:41.100 --> 19:43.220
That's to say, they weren't cheap.

19:43.220 --> 19:45.400
We then planned to release a new one each week,

19:45.400 --> 19:47.980
which meant organizing a dense production schedule.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.520
It was a massively complex, large-scale undertaking,

19:50.520 --> 19:52.160
but the engineering and production staff

19:52.160 --> 19:53.960
made it all happen without a hitch.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.880
The problem was that the concept

19:55.880 --> 19:58.680
just wasn't resonating with customers.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.120
We initially sold Nebula classes

20:00.120 --> 20:02.680
as an additional tier above normal Nebula.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.520
It was $100 a year by itself,

20:04.520 --> 20:07.560
or a $5 a month upcharge for existing subscribers,

20:07.560 --> 20:08.920
which might seem like a lot,

20:08.920 --> 20:10.600
but was actually lower than competitors

20:10.600 --> 20:11.860
with similar production quality.

20:11.860 --> 20:14.440
We ran sponsorships on this and had some minor wins,

20:14.440 --> 20:17.080
but on average, there was clearly audience confusion

20:17.100 --> 20:18.820
as we also ran bundle sponsorships

20:18.820 --> 20:21.140
on the same channels at different times.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.100
We couldn't promote classes and bundle sponsorships

20:23.100 --> 20:24.620
as classes weren't part of the bundle,

20:24.620 --> 20:29.100
so in a way, we were competing against ourselves and losing.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.300
Some people were upgrading.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.940
It wasn't some massive failure,

20:31.940 --> 20:34.380
but hardly enough to justify our rate of production.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.540
Ultimately, creators could improve sponsorship performance

20:36.540 --> 20:38.140
more by making Nebula originals,

20:38.140 --> 20:40.260
so that's what they would do.

20:40.260 --> 20:42.420
It was also clear that by the time we launched,

20:42.420 --> 20:45.900
we were on the downslope of the online classes wave.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.800
We were far from the only class platform

20:47.800 --> 20:50.120
struggling to find product market fit,

20:50.120 --> 20:53.260
so ultimately, we decided it best to just have one Nebula.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.600
No upcharge for classes.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.400
We'd make it available to all subscribers

20:56.400 --> 20:58.640
and simply slow down our production calendar.

20:58.640 --> 21:00.200
It was an important experiment,

21:00.200 --> 21:03.160
and while not a direct, overwhelming success,

21:03.160 --> 21:05.600
in a way, the marketing test we did for it

21:05.600 --> 21:07.840
proved crucial for what was to come,

21:07.840 --> 21:11.560
our biggest, most existential experiment to date.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.680
Come late 2022, as indicated in their quarterly reports,

21:14.700 --> 21:16.940
CuriosityStream was looking to pull back their growth rate

21:16.940 --> 21:18.940
and orient more towards profitability.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.320
COVID was dying down, screen time was lowering,

21:21.320 --> 21:23.420
the streaming industry overall was weakening,

21:23.420 --> 21:24.900
and so it made every sense in the world

21:24.900 --> 21:26.780
for them to switch from a growth orientation

21:26.780 --> 21:28.300
to a profit orientation,

21:28.300 --> 21:31.780
as all growth-oriented companies that survive eventually do.

21:31.780 --> 21:33.100
I assume for these reasons we got

21:33.100 --> 21:34.940
were that they wanted to significantly pull back

21:34.940 --> 21:37.900
on marketing spend through Nebula bundle sponsorships.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.540
Clearly, this wasn't something we wanted.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.700
Not only would it slow Nebula's growth rate,

21:42.720 --> 21:45.260
but more crucially, it would reduce how much

21:45.260 --> 21:47.840
we could pay creators to talk about Nebula on YouTube.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.920
This was still the primary way

21:49.920 --> 21:51.520
creators were earning through Nebula.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.240
While watch time payouts and originals were significant,

21:54.240 --> 21:56.520
payouts for YouTube sponsorships about Nebula

21:56.520 --> 21:57.960
were far more so.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.240
So the natural next question to ask was,

22:00.240 --> 22:02.760
could we just do sponsorships ourselves?

22:02.760 --> 22:04.720
You'll notice that nearly everything advertised

22:04.720 --> 22:06.600
in a sponsorship at the end of a YouTube video

22:06.600 --> 22:09.520
is an online subscription-based service.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.640
For some reason or another, these are just what works best,

22:13.460 --> 22:14.340
and here's how those advertising campaigns

22:14.340 --> 22:15.900
work in the background.

22:15.900 --> 22:18.420
Let's say a service costs $10 a month.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.240
Every service has data on how long

22:20.240 --> 22:22.040
the average subscriber sticks around.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.780
Let's say it's 27 months.

22:23.780 --> 22:27.780
That means the average lifetime value of a signup is $270.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.800
It might actually cost, say, $5 a month to run that service,

22:30.800 --> 22:33.220
meaning per month there's $5 left.

22:33.220 --> 22:35.260
A good bit of that has to go to actually getting

22:35.260 --> 22:37.820
the customers in the first place, to marketing.

22:37.820 --> 22:41.180
Knowing there's $135 left in the average lifetime value,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.840
the company will decide on a target

22:42.840 --> 22:44.280
average cost per acquisition.

22:44.280 --> 22:47.660
Let's say it's $75, leaving $60 in lifetime value

22:47.660 --> 22:50.240
for profit that can be reinvested in platform growth

22:50.240 --> 22:51.800
or just taken as profit.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.280
Now that $75 target cost per acquisition

22:54.280 --> 22:56.680
acts as the central success metric for marketing,

22:56.680 --> 22:58.400
and when an agency designs a campaign

22:58.400 --> 22:59.740
with creators pushing the service,

22:59.740 --> 23:01.320
their payment will be designed in the background

23:01.320 --> 23:02.440
by this number.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.360
If, on average, they drive 100 signups per video,

23:05.360 --> 23:08.120
their pay will be roughly $7,500 per video,

23:08.120 --> 23:10.380
and either the agency or the service itself

23:10.400 --> 23:12.160
will evaluate spots as they run

23:12.160 --> 23:13.960
to make sure the long-term average cost

23:13.960 --> 23:16.400
ends up at or below $75.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.600
This works quite well.

23:18.600 --> 23:23.120
The only issue is when that $75 needs to get paid.

23:23.120 --> 23:26.240
Here, right when the customer signs up.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.560
But on the company's side,

23:27.560 --> 23:29.960
after the $5 in monthly operating expenses,

23:29.960 --> 23:32.040
it's going to take 15 months for them

23:32.040 --> 23:34.360
to capture that $75 back in revenue.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.420
You essentially need to spend $75

23:36.420 --> 23:39.400
to eventually earn that $60 in profits.

23:39.420 --> 23:42.220
Put another way, you need to invest it.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.740
This is the role of investors in these startups.

23:44.740 --> 23:47.220
Companies can have an entirely viable business model,

23:47.220 --> 23:48.780
but just need more cash in the bank

23:48.780 --> 23:50.900
to pay for the marketing that leads to growth.

23:50.900 --> 23:52.580
We didn't want to take more investments.

23:52.580 --> 23:54.500
We didn't want to give up more ownership of the company.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.060
So the question was,

23:56.060 --> 23:58.380
could we use the couple million we had in the bank

23:58.380 --> 24:01.060
to kickstart growth at a fast enough rate?

24:01.060 --> 24:02.780
We were sure we had a viable business model.

24:02.780 --> 24:04.800
We had years of proof that we could get a customer

24:04.800 --> 24:05.940
through YouTube sponsorship

24:05.940 --> 24:08.540
for less than their average lifetime value.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.680
The question was when that cost per acquisition

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
was recaptured.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.760
If it was quick, in the first year or so,

24:14.760 --> 24:16.000
we were in business.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.540
The math worked out that we could maintain

24:17.540 --> 24:19.800
or even grow our monthly marketing spend

24:19.800 --> 24:21.680
if we would recapture revenue fast enough

24:21.680 --> 24:23.400
to reinvest it in new marketing.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.720
If it was slower,

24:24.720 --> 24:26.860
if we didn't recapture target cost per acquisition

24:26.860 --> 24:28.360
until far in the future,

24:28.360 --> 24:30.840
the careful balance that had made Nebula work

24:30.840 --> 24:33.120
or so many close equivalents failed,

24:33.120 --> 24:36.360
could all come crumbling down.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.520
Today, we're five months on

24:37.540 --> 24:39.300
from the switch to direct marketing ends.

24:39.300 --> 24:40.580
I won't breathe the lead.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.940
It went off better than our wildest expectations.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.820
Crucially, over 80% of signups are opting to pay

24:46.820 --> 24:49.500
for the annual subscription rather than the monthly one.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.620
Considering we pay creators for Nebula sponsorships

24:51.620 --> 24:53.220
the day after they go out,

24:53.220 --> 24:55.980
that means we actually get a year's worth of revenue

24:55.980 --> 24:58.100
before we even pay for the promotion.

24:58.100 --> 25:00.500
In this case, that entirely eliminated

25:00.500 --> 25:01.580
the cashflow constraint

25:01.580 --> 25:04.460
because we make more day one on an average signup

25:04.460 --> 25:07.180
than our average cost to acquire a new customer.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.320
Of course, that doesn't mean we turn a day one profit,

25:09.320 --> 25:11.400
we have operating costs beyond marketing,

25:11.400 --> 25:13.200
but it means we have a marketing strategy

25:13.200 --> 25:16.880
that could theoretically expand basically infinitely

25:16.880 --> 25:18.880
zero cashflow limitations.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.120
In just a few short months,

25:20.120 --> 25:24.560
we went from spending $0 to more than half a million dollars

25:24.560 --> 25:25.600
on marketing per month,

25:25.600 --> 25:30.120
and we are earning back more than that in the same month.

25:30.120 --> 25:33.440
I can't stress enough how incredible this is.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.840
We, the creators, are now entirely in control

25:37.380 --> 25:38.380
of our own future.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.380
With this, we're charting our most ambitious slate

25:40.380 --> 25:43.060
of originals to date, we're bringing in new creators,

25:43.060 --> 25:44.660
we're investing in our tech.

25:44.660 --> 25:48.620
There is so, so much that this big risk has unlocked.

25:48.620 --> 25:50.300
Right now, it feels like the last couple of years

25:50.300 --> 25:51.980
have been an overwhelming success,

25:51.980 --> 25:54.180
but I truly believe that, looking back,

25:54.180 --> 25:57.460
we'll consider 2023 much like we see 2019,

25:57.460 --> 25:59.260
the turning point that makes previous success

25:59.260 --> 26:01.180
the backstory you just have to get through

26:01.180 --> 26:02.300
to get to the good part.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.540
We have learned so much,

26:04.560 --> 26:07.040
so now we understand what people want

26:07.040 --> 26:09.880
and we have a company configured to offer that.

26:09.880 --> 26:13.440
I truly cannot wait to show you what we can do.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.920
Now I need to do thank yous.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.640
When describing Nebula's history like this,

26:16.640 --> 26:19.520
it feels like its success was defined by decisions.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.800
And while partially true,

26:20.800 --> 26:23.200
those decisions could only lead to anything

26:23.200 --> 26:25.880
thanks to the sum of small collective actions

26:25.880 --> 26:28.980
made by dozens, hundreds, thousands of people.

26:28.980 --> 26:32.240
First and foremost, the staff of Nebula and Standard.

26:32.260 --> 26:35.020
Unlike us creators, they do not get the public recognition

26:35.020 --> 26:36.100
for what they do.

26:36.100 --> 26:39.100
They pour their passion into servicing our passion,

26:39.100 --> 26:41.700
working day in and day out to build a system

26:41.700 --> 26:44.580
that allows us to do more of what we love to do.

26:44.580 --> 26:46.700
Nebula truly could not exist without them.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.820
Us creators could not exist without them.

26:48.820 --> 26:51.620
So I'm endlessly grateful for the work they do.

26:51.620 --> 26:52.980
Second, the creators.

26:52.980 --> 26:55.180
The community that has risen out of Nebula and Standard

26:55.180 --> 26:56.860
is just incredible.

26:56.860 --> 26:58.940
Every day we talk, celebrating our wins,

26:58.940 --> 27:00.260
commiserating our failures,

27:00.260 --> 27:02.320
searching for solutions to problems.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.600
We go to conferences together.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.840
We go on vacation together.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.120
We go to each other's weddings

27:06.120 --> 27:07.960
and we'll be at each other's funerals.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.000
I truly don't know if I could have navigated

27:10.000 --> 27:12.240
the stresses of life as a creator without them.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.880
And I know Nebula would have failed

27:13.880 --> 27:16.320
without our collective vision for a brighter future

27:16.320 --> 27:17.680
for the creator economy.

27:17.680 --> 27:20.160
Lastly, the subscribers.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.680
I could never have imagined that people would look at Nebula

27:22.680 --> 27:24.880
as anything more than a company,

27:24.880 --> 27:28.040
something trying to separate them from their dollars.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.160
But I was wrong.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.060
There is an unbelievable community of people

27:31.060 --> 27:32.740
who not only use Nebula,

27:32.740 --> 27:35.300
but have latched onto the same vision we have.

27:35.300 --> 27:37.260
They celebrate our wins and help show us

27:37.260 --> 27:38.820
where we can go stronger.

27:38.820 --> 27:41.900
I'm constantly in awe of how much forgiveness they gave us

27:41.900 --> 27:44.380
for scrappiness on our bootstrapped early days.

27:44.380 --> 27:47.300
And we could not have come to today without that.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.580
Thank you for taking a risk on us.

27:49.580 --> 27:51.040
I hope we proved it worthwhile.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.860
And I promise that we'll only work harder

27:52.860 --> 27:55.180
to make that even more so in the future.

27:55.180 --> 27:56.300
To close out,

27:56.300 --> 27:58.660
I had to pay for the production costs on this video somehow.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.000
And it kind of felt weird to make it feel even more

28:01.000 --> 28:02.240
like a big, long Nebula ad

28:02.240 --> 28:04.240
by putting a Nebula sponsorship at the end.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.360
And it felt even more weird

28:05.360 --> 28:06.960
to put another sponsor at the end.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.960
So I'm going to go with the less weird weird option,

28:08.960 --> 28:10.560
but keep it simple.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.840
If you aren't subscribed to Nebula,

28:11.840 --> 28:14.040
but want to check it out, use our link.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.720
Nebula.tv slash Wendover.

28:15.720 --> 28:18.080
You'll get $20 off an annual subscription,

28:18.080 --> 28:21.440
bringing the cost down to just $2 and 50 cents a month.

28:21.440 --> 28:24.400
Thank you for caring enough to listen to this story.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.320
It's a wild one.

28:25.320 --> 28:26.320
And I hope in a few years

28:26.340 --> 28:28.780
we have an even better one to tell you.

28:28.780 --> 28:29.620
Thanks to you.
