0	3540	I remember exactly where I was.
3540	5380	Sydney International Airport waded into board
5380	6680	a 10-hour flight to Tokyo,
6680	8340	followed by a 12-hour flight to Boston,
8340	10580	then a one-hour one to D.C. to arrive home
10580	12780	the day before Thanksgiving, 2018.
12780	15380	My agent Dave said he had an idea he wanted to run past me,
15380	16980	so he popped on a call.
16980	19620	He had just talked to Vimeo, the video streaming platform.
19620	21100	They were trying to persuade him to persuade
21100	23420	one of his other clients to build a paywall streaming site
23420	25300	for their videos using their tech.
25300	27640	This, and infinite minor variations of this,
27640	29900	was something we'd get pitched constantly as creators,
29900	33100	but everyone recognized that it couldn't really work.
33100	36300	In fact, it had a long history of not working.
36300	38540	Perhaps the most flashy failure was Vessel.
38540	39780	It launched in early 2015
39780	41480	with the big-name creators of the time.
41480	43180	Good Mythical Morning, Epic Meal Time,
43180	45080	Shane Dawson, Linus Tech Tips.
45080	46660	It was basically a YouTube replacement.
46660	48680	Same content, same creators, same features,
48680	51060	with the addition that users could pay $2.99 a month
51060	53000	to watch videos 72 hours early.
53000	54900	Combine that with their supposedly unique
54900	57220	advertising ecosystem, and the pitch to creators
57220	59300	was that they could earn dramatically more per view.
59300	61400	This is always the core proposition
61400	63040	with these alternate streaming services.
63040	64200	More revenue per view,
64200	67240	but they almost always have the same problem.
67240	70880	The number of views is orders of magnitude lower.
70880	73580	Platforms have to extract value from the audience somehow,
73580	74840	whether through a paywall or through
74840	76280	more intrusive advertising.
76280	78120	So why would a viewer watch on your platform
78120	80560	when they could watch the exact same content on YouTube
80560	83420	for free and with less intrusive advertising?
83420	85420	So creators signed on to platforms like Vessel,
85420	86960	get menial views compared to YouTube,
86960	88600	and before these platforms can grow enough
88600	89760	to get to a point where it's worth it
89760	91540	for creators beyond an initial test group,
91540	93500	they run out of money and shut down.
93500	96060	But we had some ideas on how we could fix that.
96060	99040	We thought there was a chance that we had identified
99040	102300	a magic formula that we were in a uniquely good position
102300	105220	to undertake that could make this simple concept work
105220	107680	where all others had failed.
107680	111520	Four years later, well, not to brag, but we were right.
111520	113820	Nebula has grown massively.
113820	118020	Over 650,000 paying users, 100 staff members,
118680	122320	a conservative overall valuation of over $150 million,
122320	125580	and it did all of that with absolutely zero dollars
125580	127320	of venture capital funding.
127320	128760	So what did we do different?
128760	131460	Why were we able to make this simple concept work
131460	133520	when all others had failed?
133520	136160	Clearly this video is going to be different.
136160	138700	I'm not gonna be talking about logistics or geopolitics
138700	140700	or infrastructure or another business.
140700	142240	I'm talking about my business.
142240	145140	So that's why, for the first time, I'm here.
145140	146880	This was a tricky video to write.
146900	149440	I'm trying to use my unique combination of positions
149440	152280	as an owner of a now sizable business and as a creator
152280	154200	to tell an intimate inside story
154200	157680	of how you can grow an idea into an enterprise.
157680	159180	There are a lot of things that can't be said
159180	160640	for legal or practical reasons,
160640	162920	and there are countless different stakeholders involved.
162920	165560	So what follows is what I believe is the fullest story
165560	168060	anyone can tell about the inside operations
168060	169760	of a business of this size and nature,
169760	171260	but there are, unfortunately,
171260	173020	some things I just can't talk about.
173020	176160	It's a long story, but it begins in a very small way.
176180	177920	On July 27th, 2016,
177920	181220	I got this DM from Philip Detmer of Curse Protect.
181220	182820	Hey man, let's get right to it.
182820	184980	So me and another big YouTuber might be starting something,
184980	186860	but I can't really talk about it yet.
186860	188960	We went back and forth for a month trying to schedule a call,
188960	190100	then finally we talked.
190100	192060	Basically, Philip was going to introduce me
192060	193700	to the freelance sponsorship agent
193700	196360	he and CGP Grey had been working with for years,
196360	198960	and later that might turn into something bigger.
198960	202200	That freelance sponsorship agent was Dave Whiskas.
202200	203300	That's a name you'll want to remember.
203300	204840	It's pretty relevant throughout.
204860	206660	We talked, he promised better rates
206660	208860	through a data-driven approach with an upfront commission.
208860	210140	I somehow believed him,
210140	213060	but eventually it turned out he was actually right.
213060	214500	Some important context.
214500	217800	The industry that had arisen around YouTube creators in 2016
217800	220640	was chock full of liars, cheats, and thieves.
220640	221860	It was only over the prior couple of years
221860	223700	that people could start to make a living off of YouTube,
223700	224820	and seemingly the first people
224820	226420	that thought to insert themselves as middlemen
226420	228480	were all glorified grifters.
228480	231140	Getting sponsored is crucial to going full-time on YouTube.
231140	232720	AdSense alone rarely cuts it,
232720	234580	so at the time, the only deals I could land
234580	236040	for my fledgling channel were ones
236040	238980	that automatically locked me into six months of exclusivity
238980	240460	with the agency I booked through
240460	243680	without any guarantee they would actually fill video inventory
243680	245460	and with undisclosed commissions.
245460	247720	Undisclosed commissions in this context
247720	250580	means they just told you exactly what you'd get paid,
250580	252680	which sounds great in theory, but in practice,
252680	254340	what it means is that they're selling the slot
254340	255980	to the sponsor for one price,
255980	259320	then paying you a completely different, lower price,
259320	261020	and never telling you what the difference was.
261020	262960	So just decide what they think you'll accept,
262960	264320	but you have little leverage to say no,
264320	267120	because once again, you're locked into exclusivity.
267120	269480	You're only legally allowed to work with them.
269480	270920	Oh, and also, contractually,
270920	272840	they represented the sponsor, not the creator,
272840	274320	so their incentives were to push the price
274320	275440	as low as it could go.
275440	277040	If you didn't like it and wanted to jump ship,
277040	279000	you had to go without sponsorship for six months,
279000	280760	which would kill your finances.
280760	282840	I've seen hard evidence that this particular agency
282840	285400	was taking a 50% undisclosed commission
285400	286760	on certain creator sponsorships,
286760	288560	so it's no wonder why Dave was able
288560	289960	to immediately beat their rates
289980	291660	and get sponsors to come back.
291660	293280	They might have actually been paying less,
293280	295900	but I, the creator, was getting more hit.
295900	298140	By chance, Gray and Philip had also introduced Dave
298140	299540	to Brian from Real Engineering.
299540	301140	We had collaborated on a set of videos
301140	302660	that turned out to be big viral hits
302660	304700	that launched both of our channels into relevancy,
304700	306740	so he was one of my first creator friends.
306740	309060	The next one was Joseph from RealLifeLore.
309060	311740	I had never met him in person, but we had talked plenty,
311740	312960	so I convinced him to fly out
312960	316380	to the inaugural VidCon Europe in Amsterdam in April 2017.
316380	318140	Part of the reason was because I had been nagging Dave
318140	319580	for months to work with Joseph,
320120	322400	whose channel was exploding, and Dave would be there too,
322400	324120	the perfect opportunity for them to meet.
324120	325920	Joseph ended up having a nightmare weekend
325920	328360	of travel delays, some snowstorm or something,
328360	329340	so he didn't end up getting there
329340	331240	until the afternoon of the last day,
331240	333520	but I introduced everyone and we headed to a bar.
333520	334720	We stayed there for hours.
334720	335720	Everyone hit it off,
335720	338040	and it capped off an exhilarating week out,
338040	340740	the first time any of us had seen a physical manifestation
340740	342920	of the industry we had inserted ourselves into.
342920	345160	After working in isolation, it was eye-opening
345160	346880	to see and talk to so many others
346880	349520	doing the same thing as us, and according to Dave,
350340	353060	in retrospect, this was the moment when he fully realized
353060	356140	that this informal system of freelance sponsorship booking
356140	358700	could grow into something more.
358700	361080	It'd be called Standard, a purposely forgettable name
361080	363380	for a company designed to exist in the background,
363380	366220	making life easier for the creators on center stage,
366220	367060	and it worked.
367060	369280	Creators were simply just having a better experience
369280	370460	working with Standard.
370460	372740	The rates were strong, the experience was personal,
372740	375460	the ethos ethical, in a landscape filled with grifters
375460	377980	and cheats, the concept of a sponsorship agency
377980	379680	simply doing its job fairly
379680	382280	was enough to drive natural word-of-mouth growth.
382280	384060	We added dozens of creators to the roster
384060	386560	and started to be viewed as the go-to agency
386560	387800	for educational YouTube.
387800	389480	We hired staff, got an office,
389480	391960	started throwing VidCon parties, it was all happening.
391960	394480	Unbelievably, this part, the part that at the time
394480	397080	felt like hard-earned yet incredible success,
397080	399760	needs to get glossed over to get to the good part,
399760	401920	November 27th, 2018.
401920	403400	After a couple of days of back and forth
403400	405000	with myself and a few other creators,
405000	407440	that's when Dave emailed his full roster of creators
407440	409580	the white paper, the initial concept
409580	411540	laying out our vision for Nebula.
411540	414380	This is that exact email.
414380	415860	In some ways, it was close.
415860	416880	How would this work?
416880	419140	Standard creators post ad and sponsor-free versions
419140	420620	of their videos, and occasionally
420620	422420	the service premieres exclusive content.
422420	425660	Let's say we charge users $5 per month for their service.
425660	428300	All of this is still true to this day, even the price.
428300	430420	In other ways, we were way off.
430420	431780	How do we attract viewers?
431780	434940	First, we can simply buy AdSense ads on Standard channels.
434960	438200	Sponsoring our own creators feels wrong, at least for now.
438200	440240	We can revisit it later if we think we can do it
440240	441120	without looking dumb.
441120	442960	This is about as wrong as it could be.
442960	445360	We have never figured out how to make AdSense marketing
445360	447640	for Nebula profitable, while sponsoring YouTube creators
447640	449800	has been the driving growth force.
449800	451200	We'll get to how we made that work.
451200	453800	But the real key that we understood from day one
453800	455520	was that opportunity cost.
455520	457800	To Standard, but especially to creators,
457800	461240	had to be as small as it could possibly be.
461240	463720	Equivalents before us always raised a huge amount
463740	466420	of venture capital funding, made a big splash at launch,
466420	468180	and ran out of money before profitability,
468180	470500	leaving creators embarrassed when they folded.
470500	472540	We knew that creators were wary of aligning themselves
472540	476380	to something so risky, so we needed to make a small splash.
476380	479340	We needed to design Nebula to fail gracefully.
479340	481540	We needed to make it so that if it did fail,
481540	483940	it would have the smallest possible impact
483940	486180	on reputation and finances.
486180	488100	Essentially, we followed the most dramatic form
488100	490580	of the minimum viable product model of innovation.
490580	493140	We needed to get a super scrappy version of the product
493680	495800	out into the public so that rather than us having to guess,
495800	498360	they, the customers, would tell us what they wanted
498360	499800	through how they acted.
499800	502480	You watch consumer behavior in order to fulfill their wants.
502480	504800	Luckily, a lot of the bones were already in place.
504800	507240	Dave's prior life was in the iOS app development world,
507240	509520	so he had a lot of experience in software.
509520	511280	We actually had a few engineers on staff
511280	513640	to work on the backend tool we use for sponsor billing
513640	515160	and inventory management.
515160	518080	The trickiest bit would be the actual streaming.
518080	519720	The big platforms like YouTube and Netflix
519720	522800	make it look easy, but it's quite a technical challenge
523340	525740	to distribute high-quality video on low-quality internet
525740	527700	all across the globe, and we didn't possibly
527700	529320	have the money to build our own streaming tech.
529320	531220	Of course, Vimeo originally approached us,
531220	532580	but the problem with partnering with them
532580	535100	was that they'd have owned the billing relationship.
535100	536700	Basically, when someone signed up,
536700	538700	Vimeo would keep their credit card details and info,
538700	540220	and while we'd get the money,
540220	541820	if we ever decided to split with them,
541820	544300	there was no guarantee we'd keep the subscribers.
544300	545500	So we'd rather decided to partner
545500	547620	with another streaming provider called Zype.
547620	549940	Therefore, all we had to build was a front end,
549940	551700	a slick, flashy user interface
551720	554200	to make it all look professional, and an iOS app.
554200	555800	We barely even had a backend.
555800	558140	We had Eric, who doubled as our podcast editor,
558140	559580	who would take the videos creators added
559580	561800	to a shared Dropbox folder, run them through the encoder,
561800	564560	and post them in the right spot with the right metadata.
564560	566640	All in all, it cost around $100,000
566640	568080	to get Nebula ready for launch,
568080	571200	an incredibly low sum for both the website and app,
571200	574000	but there was still one key thing we were missing.
574000	577400	You see, creators don't talk unless they're paid to.
577400	580440	This is because creators are paid to talk.
580460	581660	It's just pragmatic.
581660	583660	You basically get one call to action per video.
583660	585020	You're lucky to successfully get someone
585020	586500	to listen to one call to action,
586500	588980	so what the data shows is that if a creator, for example,
588980	591220	runs a sponsor read, then promotes their Patreon,
591220	592700	what they'll see on average
592700	594200	is that they'll earn less overall
594200	595940	than if they had just promoted the sponsor
595940	598820	as the Patreon push cuts into performance more
598820	600380	than it drives additional revenue.
600380	601460	It's not always intuitive,
601460	603060	but it's a quirk of audience behavior
603060	604360	that we'd understood for years
604360	605760	running sponsorships in standard.
605760	608260	Therefore, we knew we couldn't just simply ask creators
608260	610380	to promote Nebula out of the goodness of their arms.
610380	611960	Not only would this hurt their revenue,
611960	613280	which would mean they would stop working
613280	614520	with Nebula in the long run,
614520	616080	this would hurt standards revenue, too,
616080	618360	since it came from commission on sponsorships.
618360	619800	At the time, Standard and Nebula
619800	621320	were literally the same company
621320	623040	with zero legal separation,
623040	625680	so weirdly, free promotion for Nebula
625680	627040	would cut off the revenue source
627040	629640	that we were using to build Nebula.
629640	631980	We didn't immediately have a solution to this.
631980	634560	In all honesty, this was the biggest flaw
634560	636320	with the business model at launch.
636320	638480	But again, the launch was designed to be an experiment,
638480	640320	designed to be that minimum viable product.
640320	642360	We didn't necessarily need a big marketing method
642360	643900	at launch because the launch was designed
643900	645140	to help us find that,
645140	646660	so the last piece that we needed
646660	649780	was for the creators to be emotionally invested.
649780	651500	Everyone was excited by the concept,
651500	653360	but to assure people would stay excited
653360	655600	through the inevitably difficult early days,
655600	658640	well, we figured they might as well be financially invested.
658640	661620	So, through complex financial and legal wizardry,
661620	664260	we developed a system where 50% of Nebula profits
664260	667620	were distributed to creators, including, crucially,
667620	669820	if the platform were ever to be sold.
669840	671920	It means if one day the platform were to sell for,
671920	673520	let's say, a billion dollars,
673520	675160	the creators would get half of that.
675160	676720	We split that pool based on watch time,
676720	679200	meaning the more creators bring in and engage an audience,
679200	680700	the bigger a share they're entitled to.
680700	682280	In the short term, this would be a concept
682280	684160	that would keep creators building for the future.
684160	686320	In the medium term, this would allocate profit to creators
686320	688680	based on how much they contributed to growing that profit.
688680	691000	And in the long term, if Nebula were ever to sell,
691000	693200	this would make that a scenario where everyone wins,
693200	694760	rather than one where the platform wins
694760	696200	off the hard work of creators.
696200	698500	Not only would this directly tie platform success
698520	700440	to creator success and vice versa,
700440	702880	it would also keep everyone in that collaborative mindset,
702880	705360	one where Nebula and its creators were business partners,
705360	707360	rather than clients and servicers.
707360	709520	We win together, and we lose together.
709520	711360	Next, launch.
711360	713040	We didn't have some massive plan.
713040	714760	The website had been up and running for a bit
714760	716760	as we squashed bugs, so what really marked
716760	719120	the formal launch, if anything did,
719120	721280	was the first public promotion of the platform.
721280	722520	That came from Isaac Arthur.
722520	725040	On the morning of Thursday, May 23rd, 2019,
725040	727720	he released a video called Colonizing Black Holes,
727740	730060	which ended with a push to his Nebula original,
730060	732500	one of the first three called the Paperclip Maximizer.
732500	734660	We also had originals that launched from real life lore,
734660	736060	Second Thought, and Polyphonic,
736060	737820	so we each released videos mentioning Nebula
737820	739860	funded by a small and finite pool of money
739860	741460	dedicated to launch promotion.
741460	742620	This first weekend went better
742620	744380	than we possibly could have hoped for.
744380	746860	By Monday, we had over 4,500 signups.
746860	748900	They were trial signups, plenty would cancel,
748900	751220	but that gave us plenty enough data to work with
751220	753140	to figure out how to make this all work.
753140	755340	Better yet, we were getting buzz.
755360	757200	A lot of it was negative.
757200	758880	Almost everyone thought we'd get added
758880	761400	to the long list of failed alternate streaming sites,
761400	763600	but at the least, this told us that the idea
763600	766460	was exciting enough that people cared to care about us.
766460	767560	Over the following weeks and months,
767560	768920	we used some of our cash on hand
768920	771880	to run some very small additional marketing tests,
771880	773880	basically seeing if we could pay creators
773880	775720	a similar rate to their other sponsors
775720	777380	and bring in enough subscribers
777380	779080	to justify paying that much.
779080	781480	The answers we got were promising.
781480	783800	On one test we did on my podcast, Extremities,
783820	787020	Nebula paid us $800 and got 200 signups,
787020	789140	each of whom would pay $5 a month.
789140	791820	The only problem, we didn't have cash.
791820	793380	While we'd eventually generate cash
793380	795540	with the monthly revenue these subscribers brought in,
795540	797260	that'd be a very slow process,
797260	798660	meaning it'd be quite a while
798660	800900	until we could start sponsoring the larger YouTube channels
800900	802900	and developing bigger Nebula originals.
802900	804100	But we found a solution.
804100	807460	Standard had long-run sponsorships for CuriosityStream.
807460	809580	Another streaming service focused on documentary
809580	812300	and non-fiction content founded by Jon Hendricks,
812300	813200	the Discovery Channel.
813260	815100	To their credit, they didn't get scared
815100	817100	thinking creators were trying to replace them,
817100	818900	but rather understood that we were appealing
818900	821420	to a different, complementary market.
821420	823780	So Dave went down to the offices just outside of DC
823780	826300	and came out the other end with a win-win.
826300	827380	We'd bundle.
827380	829780	While I can't discuss the exact behind-the-scenes mechanics,
829780	832140	we found a way to make it worthwhile for both companies
832140	834620	so that when customers signed up for CuriosityStream
834620	836540	through each creator's sponsorship links,
836540	838980	they'd get access to Nebula for free.
838980	840340	Nobody could really see a downside,
840340	842740	so we negotiated details, signed a term sheet,
843320	845320	and as of September 2019, every Nebula creator
845320	846800	just started promoting the bundle
846800	849120	in their already-booked CuriosityStream spots.
849120	850800	In retrospect, it seems like a minor,
850800	855040	ultimately easy change, but it yielded massive results.
855040	857160	Personally, the bundle deal supercharged
857160	858600	my sponsorship performance.
858600	860600	It was clear that the offering of CuriosityStream
860600	862480	and Nebula together was a more convincing sell
862480	864400	to our audiences than any other sponsor
864400	865300	we ran on the channel.
865300	867140	Even better, we started to understand
867140	868720	the marketing message that worked.
868720	871040	Pushing to behind-the-scenes videos or extended cuts
871060	872340	didn't really work.
872340	874460	Pushing the idea of no ads or sponsorship
874460	877460	on Nebula worked okay, but the thing that clearly created
877460	880100	these performance multiples was full-length,
880100	882860	high-budget, exclusive originals.
882860	884500	Seeing that, CuriosityStream started
884500	886460	to co-produce Nebula originals with us.
886460	889060	In October 2019, to film our highest-budget,
889060	891500	most ambitious one to date, I flew all the way
891500	893580	to the remote Atlantic island of St. Helena
893580	895860	to make the world's most useful airport.
895860	898340	While I was there, we crossed 10,000 paying subscribers,
898360	901240	then it took less than a month more to hit 20,000.
901240	904040	By the end of the year, we had crossed 35,000,
904040	907080	and in six short months, Nebula had transformed
907080	910240	from an idea into a fast-growth startup.
910240	911480	Now, through all this history,
911480	914140	I was not actually an owner of Standard,
914140	916400	just a highly involved long-term client,
916400	918640	but it was clearly something I was interested in.
918640	920960	I was there from the start, I had helped it grow,
920960	923840	and I believed in it, and specifically Nebula's future.
923840	926520	In 2020, an opportunity arose.
926540	928860	Gray and Philip were less keen on Nebula.
928860	930420	It seemed to make less sense to them,
930420	932100	while the rest of the creator roster was,
932100	933360	so they were looking for a way
933360	934960	to end their involvement with the company.
934960	936620	Therefore, Brian from Real Engineering,
936620	938900	Alex from LowSpecGamer, Devin from Legal Eagle,
938900	940380	Thomas Frank, and myself agreed
940380	941940	to purchase their ownership stakes
941940	943420	and divide it up amongst ourselves,
943420	946140	and we were all extremely bullish on Nebula.
946140	948900	By chance, that sale occurred in March 2020,
948900	951520	the same month as the world's descent into lockdown.
951520	954940	With everyone stuck at home, the streaming industry exploded.
954960	957600	It's awkward to talk about in the context of a tragedy,
957600	959840	but the honest truth is that our bundle promotion
959840	961200	was selling faster than ever,
961200	963120	and creators were earning a lot.
963120	965120	CuriosityStream capitalized on industry momentum
965120	967980	by listing on NASDAQ through a SPAC merger in October,
967980	969480	which was initially a big success.
969480	971320	Day one ended with an 11% gain,
971320	973160	and they peaked in February 2021
973160	975320	at nearly double their first day price.
975320	978200	Through and through, the Nebula bundle was a win-win.
978200	980400	It grew Nebula, it grew CuriosityStream,
980400	982080	it grew creator sponsor payouts,
982080	984120	and it was a worthwhile proposition for all.
984140	985540	So we decided to double down
985540	987380	on aligning the success of the two companies
987380	991380	by, for the first time ever, accepting investment.
991380	994280	Now, investment had long been something we were wary of.
994280	996740	In our view, a big reason why similar business models
996740	998820	had failed in the past was because investors
998820	1000100	pressured the streaming platforms
1000100	1002880	to squeeze more and more value out of creators.
1002880	1005180	Basically, they did the thing that seemed right
1005180	1006780	when you looked at it on a slide deck,
1006780	1009300	take a bigger share of the revenue, make more money.
1009300	1011420	But that fails to understand that the creators drive
1011440	1014480	almost all of the value of a platform like Nebula.
1014480	1015800	If they're making good money,
1015800	1018160	they'll make more exclusive content for audiences,
1018160	1019560	they'll bring their creator friends in,
1019560	1021120	they'll keep promoting the platform.
1021120	1023880	So it's really that if you take a smaller slice of the pie
1023880	1025560	and give more to creators,
1025560	1027720	the pie will grow so much in the long term
1027720	1029860	that the platform will make more overall.
1029860	1032160	Every dollar a streaming platform like Nebula makes
1032160	1033520	is through the creators,
1033520	1035920	so it's about creating that win-win scenario
1035920	1037840	rather than trying to extract value
1037840	1039400	from your business partners.
1039400	1041400	We weren't confident that most investors,
1042220	1043220	especially institutional investors,
1043220	1045840	would understand that and the other nuanced dynamics
1045840	1047880	of the creator industry in the long run,
1047880	1050420	with one exception, CuriosityStream.
1050420	1052660	Their people seemed to get it.
1052660	1055340	They were also, by far, our biggest marketing partner,
1055340	1056740	biggest production partner.
1056740	1058900	We'd already aligned ourselves with them so deeply
1058900	1061220	that investment seemed like a minor additional level
1061220	1062860	that would yield a lot of cash
1062860	1064580	to reinvest in growing Nebula.
1064580	1067540	So after a unanimous vote by myself and the other owners,
1067540	1071340	Nebula no longer was entirely ours.
1072160	1073000	While the exact numbers are not public,
1073000	1075720	what is is that they bought a significant minority stake
1075720	1076840	that valued Nebula,
1076840	1080080	the company that did not exist just three years prior,
1080080	1082880	at over $50 million.
1084080	1085660	Incredible.
1085660	1086760	Driven by this funding,
1086760	1089760	2022 was comprised of some of our fastest growth to date,
1089760	1092220	especially as shows like Real Life Lore's Modern Conflicts
1092220	1095040	and Our Jetlag the Game proved massively successful
1095040	1097440	at driving huge numbers of subscriptions.
1097440	1098600	Staff had count ballooned,
1098600	1100160	especially in the engineering department,
1100160	1102480	as they staffed up to build apps for new platforms
1102480	1104300	like Roku and Samsung TV.
1104300	1105780	We also finally had the money
1105780	1107380	to build our own streaming tech,
1107380	1109580	which freed us from some of the technical limitations
1109580	1111020	of Zype's white label offering.
1111020	1111940	And we geared up to produce
1111940	1114100	our most ambitious slate of originals to date
1114100	1117100	with the co-production funding CuriosityStream would provide.
1117100	1120040	But this is a good chance to acknowledge failure.
1120040	1122820	Now, failure is inevitable in business.
1122820	1124540	It's truly part of the process.
1124540	1126460	You try new things carefully,
1126460	1128980	and success is defined by your batting average.
1129000	1131440	If you win more than you lose, you're winning.
1131440	1132840	Nebula classes, however,
1132840	1135600	probably pulled down that batting average.
1135600	1137920	It sounded like a great idea at the time.
1137920	1140120	Through COVID, creators were earning massively
1140120	1141600	by making online classes.
1141600	1144220	We were constantly approached by various class platforms
1144220	1145880	who wanted to sponsor our creators,
1145880	1148280	and so rather than promoting their services,
1148280	1149760	we thought it better to build it into Nebula
1149760	1151400	so we could promote our own service
1151400	1154040	and keep all the customer revenue in the ecosystem.
1154040	1155960	In all honesty, we were trying to capitalize
1155960	1158640	on a wave of popularity that was relatively aligned
1158700	1159980	to what we were already doing.
1159980	1161460	Unlike when we launched Nebula as a whole,
1161460	1163740	we had a good amount of cash on hand to invest in this
1163740	1165380	thanks to CuriosityStream's investment,
1165380	1166860	so we wanted to launch strong.
1166860	1168980	We built out a section of the website and apps for it,
1168980	1171180	we built the backend tech to allow for multiple tiers
1171180	1174700	of membership, and we invested a lot in content.
1174700	1177580	We launched with six classes, and each was high quality,
1177580	1178940	shot in a studio in New York,
1178940	1181100	well-edited with motion graphics and everything.
1181100	1183220	That's to say, they weren't cheap.
1183220	1185400	We then planned to release a new one each week,
1185400	1187980	which meant organizing a dense production schedule.
1188000	1190520	It was a massively complex, large-scale undertaking,
1190520	1192160	but the engineering and production staff
1192160	1193960	made it all happen without a hitch.
1193960	1195880	The problem was that the concept
1195880	1198680	just wasn't resonating with customers.
1198680	1200120	We initially sold Nebula classes
1200120	1202680	as an additional tier above normal Nebula.
1202680	1204520	It was $100 a year by itself,
1204520	1207560	or a $5 a month upcharge for existing subscribers,
1207560	1208920	which might seem like a lot,
1208920	1210600	but was actually lower than competitors
1210600	1211860	with similar production quality.
1211860	1214440	We ran sponsorships on this and had some minor wins,
1214440	1217080	but on average, there was clearly audience confusion
1217100	1218820	as we also ran bundle sponsorships
1218820	1221140	on the same channels at different times.
1221140	1223100	We couldn't promote classes and bundle sponsorships
1223100	1224620	as classes weren't part of the bundle,
1224620	1229100	so in a way, we were competing against ourselves and losing.
1229100	1230300	Some people were upgrading.
1230300	1231940	It wasn't some massive failure,
1231940	1234380	but hardly enough to justify our rate of production.
1234380	1236540	Ultimately, creators could improve sponsorship performance
1236540	1238140	more by making Nebula originals,
1238140	1240260	so that's what they would do.
1240260	1242420	It was also clear that by the time we launched,
1242420	1245900	we were on the downslope of the online classes wave.
1245920	1247800	We were far from the only class platform
1247800	1250120	struggling to find product market fit,
1250120	1253260	so ultimately, we decided it best to just have one Nebula.
1253260	1254600	No upcharge for classes.
1254600	1256400	We'd make it available to all subscribers
1256400	1258640	and simply slow down our production calendar.
1258640	1260200	It was an important experiment,
1260200	1263160	and while not a direct, overwhelming success,
1263160	1265600	in a way, the marketing test we did for it
1265600	1267840	proved crucial for what was to come,
1267840	1271560	our biggest, most existential experiment to date.
1271560	1274680	Come late 2022, as indicated in their quarterly reports,
1274700	1276940	CuriosityStream was looking to pull back their growth rate
1276940	1278940	and orient more towards profitability.
1278940	1281320	COVID was dying down, screen time was lowering,
1281320	1283420	the streaming industry overall was weakening,
1283420	1284900	and so it made every sense in the world
1284900	1286780	for them to switch from a growth orientation
1286780	1288300	to a profit orientation,
1288300	1291780	as all growth-oriented companies that survive eventually do.
1291780	1293100	I assume for these reasons we got
1293100	1294940	were that they wanted to significantly pull back
1294940	1297900	on marketing spend through Nebula bundle sponsorships.
1297900	1300540	Clearly, this wasn't something we wanted.
1300540	1302700	Not only would it slow Nebula's growth rate,
1302720	1305260	but more crucially, it would reduce how much
1305260	1307840	we could pay creators to talk about Nebula on YouTube.
1307840	1309920	This was still the primary way
1309920	1311520	creators were earning through Nebula.
1311520	1314240	While watch time payouts and originals were significant,
1314240	1316520	payouts for YouTube sponsorships about Nebula
1316520	1317960	were far more so.
1317960	1320240	So the natural next question to ask was,
1320240	1322760	could we just do sponsorships ourselves?
1322760	1324720	You'll notice that nearly everything advertised
1324720	1326600	in a sponsorship at the end of a YouTube video
1326600	1329520	is an online subscription-based service.
1329520	1332640	For some reason or another, these are just what works best,
1333460	1334340	and here's how those advertising campaigns
1334340	1335900	work in the background.
1335900	1338420	Let's say a service costs $10 a month.
1338420	1340240	Every service has data on how long
1340240	1342040	the average subscriber sticks around.
1342040	1343780	Let's say it's 27 months.
1343780	1347780	That means the average lifetime value of a signup is $270.
1347780	1350800	It might actually cost, say, $5 a month to run that service,
1350800	1353220	meaning per month there's $5 left.
1353220	1355260	A good bit of that has to go to actually getting
1355260	1357820	the customers in the first place, to marketing.
1357820	1361180	Knowing there's $135 left in the average lifetime value,
1361200	1362840	the company will decide on a target
1362840	1364280	average cost per acquisition.
1364280	1367660	Let's say it's $75, leaving $60 in lifetime value
1367660	1370240	for profit that can be reinvested in platform growth
1370240	1371800	or just taken as profit.
1371800	1374280	Now that $75 target cost per acquisition
1374280	1376680	acts as the central success metric for marketing,
1376680	1378400	and when an agency designs a campaign
1378400	1379740	with creators pushing the service,
1379740	1381320	their payment will be designed in the background
1381320	1382440	by this number.
1382440	1385360	If, on average, they drive 100 signups per video,
1385360	1388120	their pay will be roughly $7,500 per video,
1388120	1390380	and either the agency or the service itself
1390400	1392160	will evaluate spots as they run
1392160	1393960	to make sure the long-term average cost
1393960	1396400	ends up at or below $75.
1396400	1398600	This works quite well.
1398600	1403120	The only issue is when that $75 needs to get paid.
1403120	1406240	Here, right when the customer signs up.
1406240	1407560	But on the company's side,
1407560	1409960	after the $5 in monthly operating expenses,
1409960	1412040	it's going to take 15 months for them
1412040	1414360	to capture that $75 back in revenue.
1414360	1416420	You essentially need to spend $75
1416420	1419400	to eventually earn that $60 in profits.
1419420	1422220	Put another way, you need to invest it.
1422220	1424740	This is the role of investors in these startups.
1424740	1427220	Companies can have an entirely viable business model,
1427220	1428780	but just need more cash in the bank
1428780	1430900	to pay for the marketing that leads to growth.
1430900	1432580	We didn't want to take more investments.
1432580	1434500	We didn't want to give up more ownership of the company.
1434500	1436060	So the question was,
1436060	1438380	could we use the couple million we had in the bank
1438380	1441060	to kickstart growth at a fast enough rate?
1441060	1442780	We were sure we had a viable business model.
1442780	1444800	We had years of proof that we could get a customer
1444800	1445940	through YouTube sponsorship
1445940	1448540	for less than their average lifetime value.
1448560	1451680	The question was when that cost per acquisition
1451680	1452680	was recaptured.
1452680	1454760	If it was quick, in the first year or so,
1454760	1456000	we were in business.
1456000	1457540	The math worked out that we could maintain
1457540	1459800	or even grow our monthly marketing spend
1459800	1461680	if we would recapture revenue fast enough
1461680	1463400	to reinvest it in new marketing.
1463400	1464720	If it was slower,
1464720	1466860	if we didn't recapture target cost per acquisition
1466860	1468360	until far in the future,
1468360	1470840	the careful balance that had made Nebula work
1470840	1473120	or so many close equivalents failed,
1473120	1476360	could all come crumbling down.
1476360	1477520	Today, we're five months on
1477540	1479300	from the switch to direct marketing ends.
1479300	1480580	I won't breathe the lead.
1480580	1483940	It went off better than our wildest expectations.
1483940	1486820	Crucially, over 80% of signups are opting to pay
1486820	1489500	for the annual subscription rather than the monthly one.
1489500	1491620	Considering we pay creators for Nebula sponsorships
1491620	1493220	the day after they go out,
1493220	1495980	that means we actually get a year's worth of revenue
1495980	1498100	before we even pay for the promotion.
1498100	1500500	In this case, that entirely eliminated
1500500	1501580	the cashflow constraint
1501580	1504460	because we make more day one on an average signup
1504460	1507180	than our average cost to acquire a new customer.
1507720	1509320	Of course, that doesn't mean we turn a day one profit,
1509320	1511400	we have operating costs beyond marketing,
1511400	1513200	but it means we have a marketing strategy
1513200	1516880	that could theoretically expand basically infinitely
1516880	1518880	zero cashflow limitations.
1518880	1520120	In just a few short months,
1520120	1524560	we went from spending $0 to more than half a million dollars
1524560	1525600	on marketing per month,
1525600	1530120	and we are earning back more than that in the same month.
1530120	1533440	I can't stress enough how incredible this is.
1533440	1536840	We, the creators, are now entirely in control
1537380	1538380	of our own future.
1538380	1540380	With this, we're charting our most ambitious slate
1540380	1543060	of originals to date, we're bringing in new creators,
1543060	1544660	we're investing in our tech.
1544660	1548620	There is so, so much that this big risk has unlocked.
1548620	1550300	Right now, it feels like the last couple of years
1550300	1551980	have been an overwhelming success,
1551980	1554180	but I truly believe that, looking back,
1554180	1557460	we'll consider 2023 much like we see 2019,
1557460	1559260	the turning point that makes previous success
1559260	1561180	the backstory you just have to get through
1561180	1562300	to get to the good part.
1562300	1564540	We have learned so much,
1564560	1567040	so now we understand what people want
1567040	1569880	and we have a company configured to offer that.
1569880	1573440	I truly cannot wait to show you what we can do.
1573440	1574920	Now I need to do thank yous.
1574920	1576640	When describing Nebula's history like this,
1576640	1579520	it feels like its success was defined by decisions.
1579520	1580800	And while partially true,
1580800	1583200	those decisions could only lead to anything
1583200	1585880	thanks to the sum of small collective actions
1585880	1588980	made by dozens, hundreds, thousands of people.
1588980	1592240	First and foremost, the staff of Nebula and Standard.
1592260	1595020	Unlike us creators, they do not get the public recognition
1595020	1596100	for what they do.
1596100	1599100	They pour their passion into servicing our passion,
1599100	1601700	working day in and day out to build a system
1601700	1604580	that allows us to do more of what we love to do.
1604580	1606700	Nebula truly could not exist without them.
1606700	1608820	Us creators could not exist without them.
1608820	1611620	So I'm endlessly grateful for the work they do.
1611620	1612980	Second, the creators.
1612980	1615180	The community that has risen out of Nebula and Standard
1615180	1616860	is just incredible.
1616860	1618940	Every day we talk, celebrating our wins,
1618940	1620260	commiserating our failures,
1620260	1622320	searching for solutions to problems.
1622320	1623600	We go to conferences together.
1623600	1624840	We go on vacation together.
1624840	1626120	We go to each other's weddings
1626120	1627960	and we'll be at each other's funerals.
1627960	1630000	I truly don't know if I could have navigated
1630000	1632240	the stresses of life as a creator without them.
1632240	1633880	And I know Nebula would have failed
1633880	1636320	without our collective vision for a brighter future
1636320	1637680	for the creator economy.
1637680	1640160	Lastly, the subscribers.
1640160	1642680	I could never have imagined that people would look at Nebula
1642680	1644880	as anything more than a company,
1644880	1648040	something trying to separate them from their dollars.
1648040	1649160	But I was wrong.
1649180	1651060	There is an unbelievable community of people
1651060	1652740	who not only use Nebula,
1652740	1655300	but have latched onto the same vision we have.
1655300	1657260	They celebrate our wins and help show us
1657260	1658820	where we can go stronger.
1658820	1661900	I'm constantly in awe of how much forgiveness they gave us
1661900	1664380	for scrappiness on our bootstrapped early days.
1664380	1667300	And we could not have come to today without that.
1667300	1669580	Thank you for taking a risk on us.
1669580	1671040	I hope we proved it worthwhile.
1671040	1672860	And I promise that we'll only work harder
1672860	1675180	to make that even more so in the future.
1675180	1676300	To close out,
1676300	1678660	I had to pay for the production costs on this video somehow.
1679160	1681000	And it kind of felt weird to make it feel even more
1681000	1682240	like a big, long Nebula ad
1682240	1684240	by putting a Nebula sponsorship at the end.
1684240	1685360	And it felt even more weird
1685360	1686960	to put another sponsor at the end.
1686960	1688960	So I'm going to go with the less weird weird option,
1688960	1690560	but keep it simple.

1701440	1704400	Thank you for caring enough to listen to this story.
1704400	1705320	It's a wild one.
1705320	1706320	And I hope in a few years
1706340	1708780	we have an even better one to tell you.
1708780	1709620	Thanks to you.
