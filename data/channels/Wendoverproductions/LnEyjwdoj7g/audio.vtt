00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.380 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.060 --> 00:25.060
bit more about our amazing world.

00:25.060 --> 00:26.780
This number is illegal.

00:26.780 --> 00:28.280
Well, kinda.

00:28.280 --> 00:32.420
I switch it a few digits to protect myself since, you know, it's illegal, but just

00:32.420 --> 00:36.440
the possession of this number is enough to get you arrested in the US.

00:36.440 --> 00:39.720
To understand why, we need to learn some cryptology.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.000
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one.

00:44.000 --> 00:49.040
For example, nothing multiplies together to get 7 other than 7 and 1.

00:49.040 --> 00:52.560
Nothing multiplies together to get 29 other than 29 and 1.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.560
This will be the same for all primes.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.120
It's not that hard to check if a smaller number is prime.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.800
For 7, you just check if 7 divided by 1 is a whole number, 7 divided by 2, by 3, by 4,

01:03.800 --> 01:08.880
by 5, by 6, nothing other than 7 can divide 7 into a whole number.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.600
As you get to bigger and bigger numbers, you have to check more and more times to determine

01:12.600 --> 01:14.300
if a number is prime.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.720
That means that it's exceedingly difficult to find new primes.

01:17.720 --> 01:24.720
The largest prime number that we know of right now is 2 to the power of 74,207,281 minus

01:24.720 --> 01:25.720
1.

01:25.720 --> 01:28.960
That's an infinite number of primes since there's an infinite number of numbers, but

01:28.960 --> 01:32.980
it just takes an enormous amount of computing power to find these primes.

01:32.980 --> 01:34.520
So what's the point of finding primes?

01:34.520 --> 01:37.720
Well, they're actually quite useful for encryption.

01:37.720 --> 01:42.700
For the sake of simplicity, let's take two small primesâ€”11 and 13.

01:42.700 --> 01:46.960
If we were actually encrypting data, we would be using primes with thousands of digits but

01:46.960 --> 01:49.920
that would probably make this explanation a little complicated.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.320
Now, multiply 11 and 13 together in your head.

01:58.720 --> 02:02.840
You can probably figure out pretty easily that together they make 143.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.720
Now how long would it take you to work backwards and figure out what multiplies together to

02:06.720 --> 02:08.620
get 143?

02:08.620 --> 02:09.680
Probably a pretty long time.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.400
It's the same with computers.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.680
It's very easy for them to multiply two numbers together and find out what the product

02:15.680 --> 02:19.360
is, but it's very hard for them to take the product and find out what the factors

02:19.360 --> 02:20.860
are.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.560
When you're logging on to, say, your bank account online, the computer will send the

02:24.560 --> 02:29.200
number 143, which is known as the public key, to the bank server.

02:29.200 --> 02:35.640
The bank will then check if 11 and 13, the private keys, multiply to 143 and if so, it

02:35.640 --> 02:36.920
will let you in.

02:36.920 --> 02:41.400
Everyone has the public key, but only the bank has the private keys.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.280
If you wanted to find the private keys, you would need a computer to factor the public

02:45.280 --> 02:50.120
key, which would take thousands of years because, once again, in the real world, the

02:50.120 --> 02:55.560
keys aren't 11 and 13, they're prime numbers with thousands upon thousands of digits.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.660
With the amount of money that it would take to set up a computer system that could actually

02:58.660 --> 03:01.460
factor the primes, it's just not worth it.

03:01.460 --> 03:05.960
The bigger the prime number, the longer it takes to factor and the more secure it is.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.680
That's why organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation are willing to pay up

03:10.680 --> 03:15.080
to $250,000 for new prime numbers.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.240
Alright, that's all the math we're going to do today, I promise.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.680
Back to our legal number.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.880
In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in the US, making it illegal

03:24.880 --> 03:29.680
to circumvent copyright measures and to produce or distribute tools that could be used to

03:29.680 --> 03:31.920
get around copyright systems.

03:31.920 --> 03:37.780
Our legal number, 8565078 and so on and so forth, is a prime number that is the source

03:37.780 --> 03:41.740
code used to decrypt the copyright protection of DVDs.

03:41.740 --> 03:46.120
The copyright protection was used to stop people from downloading or duplicating movies

03:46.120 --> 03:50.580
on their computers and, with this number, the protection was rendered useless.

03:50.580 --> 03:54.920
Programs were created that allowed individuals to make bootleg copies of movies all because

03:54.920 --> 03:56.520
of this number.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.400
All the while, individuals were breaking the law not only by copying DVDs, but also just

04:01.400 --> 04:06.160
by being in possession of this numberâ€”an easily findable prime.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.340
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.
