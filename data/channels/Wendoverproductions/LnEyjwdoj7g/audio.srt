00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,060
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,780
This number is illegal.

10
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,280
Well, kinda.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:32,420
I switch it a few digits to protect myself since, you know, it's illegal, but just

12
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:36,440
the possession of this number is enough to get you arrested in the US.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,720
To understand why, we need to learn some cryptology.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,000
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,040
For example, nothing multiplies together to get 7 other than 7 and 1.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,560
Nothing multiplies together to get 29 other than 29 and 1.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,560
This will be the same for all primes.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,120
It's not that hard to check if a smaller number is prime.

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,800
For 7, you just check if 7 divided by 1 is a whole number, 7 divided by 2, by 3, by 4,

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,880
by 5, by 6, nothing other than 7 can divide 7 into a whole number.

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,600
As you get to bigger and bigger numbers, you have to check more and more times to determine

22
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,300
if a number is prime.

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,720
That means that it's exceedingly difficult to find new primes.

24
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,720
The largest prime number that we know of right now is 2 to the power of 74,207,281 minus

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,720
1.

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,960
That's an infinite number of primes since there's an infinite number of numbers, but

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,980
it just takes an enormous amount of computing power to find these primes.

28
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,520
So what's the point of finding primes?

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,720
Well, they're actually quite useful for encryption.

30
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,700
For the sake of simplicity, let's take two small primesâ€”11 and 13.

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,960
If we were actually encrypting data, we would be using primes with thousands of digits but

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
that would probably make this explanation a little complicated.

33
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,320
Now, multiply 11 and 13 together in your head.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,840
You can probably figure out pretty easily that together they make 143.

35
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,720
Now how long would it take you to work backwards and figure out what multiplies together to

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,620
get 143?

37
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,680
Probably a pretty long time.

38
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,400
It's the same with computers.

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,680
It's very easy for them to multiply two numbers together and find out what the product

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,360
is, but it's very hard for them to take the product and find out what the factors

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,860
are.

42
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,560
When you're logging on to, say, your bank account online, the computer will send the

43
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,200
number 143, which is known as the public key, to the bank server.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,640
The bank will then check if 11 and 13, the private keys, multiply to 143 and if so, it

45
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,920
will let you in.

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,400
Everyone has the public key, but only the bank has the private keys.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,280
If you wanted to find the private keys, you would need a computer to factor the public

48
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,120
key, which would take thousands of years because, once again, in the real world, the

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,560
keys aren't 11 and 13, they're prime numbers with thousands upon thousands of digits.

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,660
With the amount of money that it would take to set up a computer system that could actually

51
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,460
factor the primes, it's just not worth it.

52
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,960
The bigger the prime number, the longer it takes to factor and the more secure it is.

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,680
That's why organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation are willing to pay up

54
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,080
to $250,000 for new prime numbers.

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,240
Alright, that's all the math we're going to do today, I promise.

56
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,680
Back to our legal number.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,880
In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in the US, making it illegal

58
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,680
to circumvent copyright measures and to produce or distribute tools that could be used to

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,920
get around copyright systems.

60
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,780
Our legal number, 8565078 and so on and so forth, is a prime number that is the source

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,740
code used to decrypt the copyright protection of DVDs.

62
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,120
The copyright protection was used to stop people from downloading or duplicating movies

63
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,580
on their computers and, with this number, the protection was rendered useless.

64
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,920
Programs were created that allowed individuals to make bootleg copies of movies all because

65
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,520
of this number.

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,400
All the while, individuals were breaking the law not only by copying DVDs, but also just

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,160
by being in possession of this numberâ€”an easily findable prime.

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,340
