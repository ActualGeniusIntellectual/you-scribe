0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13380	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13380	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21060	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21060	25060	bit more about our amazing world.
25060	26780	This number is illegal.
26780	28280	Well, kinda.
28280	32420	I switch it a few digits to protect myself since, you know, it's illegal, but just
32420	36440	the possession of this number is enough to get you arrested in the US.
36440	39720	To understand why, we need to learn some cryptology.
39720	44000	Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by themselves and one.
44000	49040	For example, nothing multiplies together to get 7 other than 7 and 1.
49040	52560	Nothing multiplies together to get 29 other than 29 and 1.
52560	54560	This will be the same for all primes.
54560	58120	It's not that hard to check if a smaller number is prime.
58120	63800	For 7, you just check if 7 divided by 1 is a whole number, 7 divided by 2, by 3, by 4,
63800	68880	by 5, by 6, nothing other than 7 can divide 7 into a whole number.
68880	72600	As you get to bigger and bigger numbers, you have to check more and more times to determine
72600	74300	if a number is prime.
74300	77720	That means that it's exceedingly difficult to find new primes.
77720	84720	The largest prime number that we know of right now is 2 to the power of 74,207,281 minus
84720	85720	1.
85720	88960	That's an infinite number of primes since there's an infinite number of numbers, but
88960	92980	it just takes an enormous amount of computing power to find these primes.
92980	94520	So what's the point of finding primes?
94520	97720	Well, they're actually quite useful for encryption.
97720	102700	For the sake of simplicity, let's take two small primes—11 and 13.
102700	106960	If we were actually encrypting data, we would be using primes with thousands of digits but
106960	109920	that would probably make this explanation a little complicated.
110120	113320	Now, multiply 11 and 13 together in your head.
118720	122840	You can probably figure out pretty easily that together they make 143.
122840	126720	Now how long would it take you to work backwards and figure out what multiplies together to
126720	128620	get 143?
128620	129680	Probably a pretty long time.
129680	131400	It's the same with computers.
131400	135680	It's very easy for them to multiply two numbers together and find out what the product
135680	139360	is, but it's very hard for them to take the product and find out what the factors
139360	140860	are.
140860	144560	When you're logging on to, say, your bank account online, the computer will send the
144560	149200	number 143, which is known as the public key, to the bank server.
149200	155640	The bank will then check if 11 and 13, the private keys, multiply to 143 and if so, it
155640	156920	will let you in.
156920	161400	Everyone has the public key, but only the bank has the private keys.
161400	165280	If you wanted to find the private keys, you would need a computer to factor the public
165280	170120	key, which would take thousands of years because, once again, in the real world, the
170120	175560	keys aren't 11 and 13, they're prime numbers with thousands upon thousands of digits.
175560	178660	With the amount of money that it would take to set up a computer system that could actually
178660	181460	factor the primes, it's just not worth it.
181460	185960	The bigger the prime number, the longer it takes to factor and the more secure it is.
185960	190680	That's why organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation are willing to pay up
190680	195080	to $250,000 for new prime numbers.
195120	198240	Alright, that's all the math we're going to do today, I promise.
198240	199680	Back to our legal number.
199680	204880	In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in the US, making it illegal
204880	209680	to circumvent copyright measures and to produce or distribute tools that could be used to
209680	211920	get around copyright systems.
211920	217780	Our legal number, 8565078 and so on and so forth, is a prime number that is the source
217780	221740	code used to decrypt the copyright protection of DVDs.
221740	226120	The copyright protection was used to stop people from downloading or duplicating movies
226120	230580	on their computers and, with this number, the protection was rendered useless.
230580	234920	Programs were created that allowed individuals to make bootleg copies of movies all because
234920	236520	of this number.
236520	241400	All the while, individuals were breaking the law not only by copying DVDs, but also just
241400	246160	by being in possession of this number—an easily findable prime.
