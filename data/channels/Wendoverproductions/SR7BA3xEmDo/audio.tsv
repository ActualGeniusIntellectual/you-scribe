9840	15500	It's really just four lanes, a median, and some on and off ramps.
15500	22280	The Interstate Highway System is no engineering marvel, no unprecedented undertaking, no massively
22280	23520	innovative concept.
23520	28920	It's a simple idea—one that arose since the earliest days of the automobile.
28920	34460	It's not exciting, which is why it often goes so underappreciated.
34460	39060	Take the Interstates away, though, and you have a weaker nation.
39060	45160	You have one with dramatically starker regional divides, one with increased decentralization—more
45160	50960	specifically, you have a nation absent of a noticeable portion of the late 1900s economic
50960	53600	development and transformation.
53600	59200	These words, like the system itself, still aren't exciting, but put more simply, if
59200	64480	you are an American, regardless of whether you use the Interstate system, your life would
64480	68560	be noticeably different in a reality without the Interstates.
68560	74760	It's a single collection of roadways, with an influence so great that it permeates into
74760	78140	every American's life.
78140	82340	It all started here, 102 years ago.
82340	87860	Seventy-nine vehicles departed from the White House's ellipse at 1115 AM on July 7th,
87860	88860	1919.
88860	92820	They snaked through the district streets before crossing into Maryland and stopping for lunch
92820	95380	in Rockville at 1230 PM.
95380	99820	The coupling on one of their kitchen trailers broke, and a car's fan belt too, but all
99820	106700	in all, it was an uneventful 7-hour, 46-mile, 74-kilometer journey to the Frederick Fairgrounds.
107260	113260	Twelve and a half hours later, they woke up, left, drove, arrived, and slept again.
113260	115460	This cycle repeated itself.
115460	121300	Day after day, they cut 40 or 50 or 60 miles deeper into their westward journey.
121300	124500	The convoy climbed through the heights of the Appalachian Mountains, trekked through
124500	131100	the mud of Ohio, before crossing the Mississippi River at 4.10 PM on July 22nd.
131100	135540	From there, they entered an area defined by desolation.
135540	140980	Few dared venture west in a motor vehicle in 1919, always opting for the relative comfort
140980	143660	and speed of passenger trains.
143660	148620	This convoy, though, was making the journey specifically to determine just how difficult
148620	155500	this feat was—to what extent such a journey was feasible for military logistics purposes.
155500	158260	The answer came quickly.
158260	162900	Despite routing themselves on the most developed transcontinental road of the time, the Lincoln
162900	167740	Highway, they constantly had to divert around disrepair, physically disassemble covered
167740	172560	bridges to get their trucks through, and fight physics on roads too narrow for an oncoming
172560	174660	car to pass.
174660	180500	Gas stations were few and far between, so such travel required truly expedition-level
180500	181500	planning.
181500	185400	Each time they entered a city, though, they were greeted by hordes of intrigued locals
185400	190460	and dignitaries, but those crowds thinned as the convoy crawled further into the desolate
190460	191460	west.
191460	196940	Most, but certainly not all, of their vehicles successfully traversed the Rockies, and the
196940	201220	same can be said for their trip across some of the Lincoln Highway's roughest roads
201220	202500	in Utah.
202500	207600	With time, though, the trend reversed, roads improved, and they finally saw pavement again
207600	211880	as the convoy entered California—its final state.
211880	216540	After a final evening in Oakland, California, the vehicles loaded onto a ferry, crossed
216540	222460	the bay, and made a ceremonious arrival in San Francisco accompanied by a massive parade
222460	224340	and a formal dinner.
224340	231220	That was September 6th, 1919—sixty-two days after their departure from the White House
231220	232600	Ellipse.
232600	236780	Having concentrated nearly all their waking hours on driving, the math works out to an
236780	242820	average travel speed of just 5.65 miles or 9 kilometers per hour—a staggeringly slow
242820	247740	pace on a road branded as a highway, in a year featuring technologies such as electric
247740	251520	refrigerators, airplanes, and long-distance phone service.
251520	255960	The convoy accomplished its mission of appraising the feasibility of this route for more practical
255960	261140	military purposes, but the report back to Washington was not positive.
261140	265440	One lieutenant colonel, tasked with observing the journey, wrote, quote,
265440	269780	"'Extended trips by trucks through the Middle Western part of the United States are impractical
269780	275860	until the roads are improved, and then only a light truck should be used on long hauls.'"
275860	281180	It was clear that, for now, until roads were improved, transcontinental motor trips would
281180	285660	remain the domain of publicity stunts and enthusiasts.
285660	289500	But then the years started passing.
289500	293420	Administration after administration, observing the growing presence of motor vehicles in
293420	298340	the lives of increasingly everyday Americans, recognized that road construction was not
298340	301380	something that could be left the responsibility of states.
301380	306220	While individual states did make plenty of progress building high-quality urban and rural
306220	309060	roads, their interests were insular.
309060	313820	Iowa, for example, would have no interest building a highway with the primary purpose
313820	316300	of connecting Illinois to Nebraska.
316300	320380	As Americans went off to fight in Europe during World War II, they observed the efficiency
320380	325140	of Germany's national Reichsautobahn highway system, but when they returned home, they
325140	329780	were forced to navigate a patchwork of state systems of varying quality to get anywhere
329780	332340	beyond their local areas.
332340	337460	In the 1950s, when America was a near decade out from landing men on the moon, it still
337460	343000	took significant planning and the better part of ten days to reasonably traverse from one
343000	344860	coast to the other.
344860	348980	While this might have been inconvenient for road-tripping Americans, it mostly meant that
348980	354220	there were regions that simply could not compete with coastal areas in the industrial sector
354220	357220	due to high transport costs and times.
357220	361420	It was clear something had to change, but efforts to increase highway construction at
361420	366060	the federal level were constantly stalled by funding issues and the general lack of
366060	367340	volition.
367340	370460	But then came someone new.
370460	375700	One of the members of the 1919 Transcontinental Convoy—in fact, the very lieutenant colonel
375700	380340	who provided the earlier report on the journey to Washington—continued on in his military
380340	385300	career and rose through the ranks until he became supreme Allied commander of the European
385300	387460	theater in World War II.
387460	393060	Then, upon return to the US, he entered a political career, culminating with his inauguration
393060	397660	as president on January 20th, 1953.
397660	402340	This was, of course, Dwight D. Eisenhower.
402340	407100	With the groundwork laid by decades of planning and false starts, Eisenhower's task was
407100	412460	centered on finally finding the political will and funding to turn this concept map,
412460	417460	a 1955 publication by the Bureau of Public Roads, into reality.
417460	422000	After nearly three years of political maneuvering, he succeeded.
422000	430100	On June 29th, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was signed, dedicating some $25 billion
430100	435660	to constructing 41,000 miles or 66,000 kilometers of highway.
435660	440540	Unlike previous attempts at similar programs, the federal government would now pay 90% of
440540	446180	the costs of these interstate highways, with individual states responsible for the rest—largely
446180	449100	funded by a hike in the federal gas tax.
449100	453460	Just three months after the bill's signing, paving work began on a section of Interstate
453460	459740	70 in Kansas, and two months after that, the same section opened to the public—representing
459740	464860	the first miles of a system that would engulf the country over the coming decades.
465060	471580	Now, whether it's I-40 in Tennessee or I-90 through Idaho, the way these roads were built
471580	475120	was highly, highly standardized.
475120	478000	That was, after all, the point.
478000	483720	These standards are codified in a simple eight-page document entitled, A Policy on Design Standards
483720	485260	Interstate System.
485260	491340	To start with, fundamentally, interstates must have controlled access, meaning the manner
491340	496660	in which vehicles enter or exit the roadway must be controlled through on and off ramps.
496660	501480	That's why, unlike with many state highways, you never see intersections with stoplights
501480	505280	on interstates, except when rules are violated.
505280	510700	The standards also set out a minimum speed—50 miles or 80 kilometers per hour in urban and
510700	517260	mountainous areas, 70 miles or 110 kilometers per hour in rural areas, and maximum grade—up
517260	523860	to 7%, corresponding to 370 feet of elevation gain per mile of road, or 70 meters per kilometer,
523860	526280	depending on speed and topography.
526280	531620	There must be at least two lanes in each direction of travel, 12 feet or 3.5 meters in width,
531620	536540	with a cross slope—essentially an angle to allow for rain runoff—of at least 1.5
536540	538980	and ideally 2% grade.
538980	543540	Tunnels and bridges must have at least 16 feet or 5 meters of vertical clearance, although
543540	548300	less is allowed through urban areas as long as an alternate route with 16-foot clearance
548300	549620	is available.
549620	555340	Aside from a few smaller details, that's the entirety of the interstate highway design
555340	556340	standards.
556340	558380	It's incredibly simple.
558380	562900	Implementing this nationwide, however, was no simple endeavor.
562900	569700	When the project started, in the 50s, one mile of interstate cost some $8.5 million
569700	575660	to construct, or $5.3 million per kilometer, however, through the decades, as labor costs
575660	581500	rose and the simplest sections stood completed, this ramped up to over $34 million per mile,
581500	583980	or $21 million per kilometer.
583980	589180	Unsurprisingly, the interstate system quickly blew past its original $25 billion budget
589180	593120	allocation, but people and governments were convinced.
593120	597540	The project gained more and more funding, and was reaching completion by the time the
597540	600080	80s turned into the 90s.
600080	606960	To complete the original vision, just one last section remained—a 12.5 mile, 20 kilometer
606960	610020	stretch through Glenwood Canyon, Colorado.
610020	614540	With thousand-foot walls flanking on each side, little room exists aside the Colorado
614540	619380	River for a roadway, but a complex collection of bridges and tunnels were constructed at
619380	626800	a cost of $960 million, inflation adjusted, corresponding to $75 million per mile, or
626800	630120	$47 million per kilometer of roadway.
630120	635280	Once this engineering marvel was completed in 1992, however, the nation was connected,
635280	641180	and more than two decades after his death, Eisenhower's vision was realized.
641180	649820	His 62-day transcontinental expedition from 1919 now takes a mere 42 hours.
649820	655040	In such a decentralized country, consisting of a patchwork of states each with unique
655040	660480	governments, laws, cultures, and more, the consistency of a nationwide federal transportation
660480	663400	system is, in and of itself, unique.
663400	668100	It is one of the most regular interactions Americans, especially in far-flung western
668100	672120	and southern regions, might have with a federal program.
672120	678120	Today, the largest urban center located further than 25 miles or 40 kilometers from an interstate
678120	683220	highway is Fresno, California, with a population of about half a million.
683220	690600	In fact, only 14 cities with over 100,000 people are located further than this distance.
690600	695420	Even Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are now included in this program, despite the fact
695420	699300	that their interstates don't actually extend interstate.
699300	705720	With wide lanes, smooth turns, consistent grades, and more, these highways are remarkably
705720	706720	safe.
706720	713060	While nationwide the US averages 1.3 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, interstates,
713060	719280	for the same 100 million vehicle miles, observe just 0.55 deaths each year.
719280	724660	Incredibly, that means that, assuming the alternative is equivalent travel on non-interstate
724660	731260	roads, this system is responsible for saving about 6,500 lives per year.
731260	736380	Beyond the moral component—the innate human desire to preserve life—the US Department
736380	742280	of Transportation, on a statistical basis, values a human life at $11.7 million when
742280	746600	evaluating potential safety standards, so the safety profile of the interstate highway
746600	753200	system by itself has a theoretical economic impact of about $75 billion per year, therefore
753200	756320	easily justifying its cost alone.
756320	759160	But then there's the more direct impacts.
759160	763120	Among the more populated states, construction disproportionately took place in southern
763120	768040	states such as Georgia, South Carolina, or Arkansas, on a basis of miles constructed
768040	769040	per capita.
769040	773900	Then, in less populous states, the interstate disproportionately penetrated the American
773900	780120	West, with states such as Utah, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming receiving the most miles per capita.
780120	785400	Therefore, it was the south and west that received the greatest impact.
785400	791520	In essence, what these roadways did was connect the US's economic centers to the periphery,
791520	795860	so the periphery had the most to gain by, effectively, reducing the relative distance
795860	799780	to centers by a factor of 30%, on average.
799780	804280	In the case of Interstate 5, for example, which runs along the entire west coast from
804280	809040	the border to Mexico to that with Canada, California, the state that encompasses the
809040	813240	majority of its distance actually sees the smallest benefit.
813240	817800	That's not to say the benefit is small—the removal of the interstate would correspond
817800	824160	to a 6% loss in overall income in the state—but Oregon, the 12th most sparsely populated state
824160	829560	in the nation, would lose 15% of its income if I-5 simply disappeared.
829560	835720	It's worth fully considering just how staggering that statistic is.
835720	843400	A single, simple, four-lane roadway, stretching some 300 miles or 500 kilometers through Oregon,
843400	847900	attributable for 15% of its income.
847900	850640	This does, however, make sense.
850640	855720	Oregon's economy, significantly undergirded by the natural resources, manufacturing, and
855720	859740	agricultural sectors, is highly trade-dependent.
859740	865680	The state does not, however, have any major export ports, so when a manufacturer in Salem,
865680	870280	Oregon, for example, needs to transport the finished products to the Port of Oakland,
870280	875080	it would likely hire a truck to take the nine-hour journey south on I-5.
875080	879880	The shortest non-interstate route, however, would take 13 and a half hours on roads with
879880	885200	potentially burdensome weight restrictions, inadequate facilities, low bridges, and other
885200	886200	constraints.
886200	888920	It just makes getting product out harder.
889280	895120	Now, ultimately, transport cost is rarely an enormous portion of a given product's
895120	900400	cost—a five-cent increase on a $10 product produced further from Oakland isn't massive—but
900400	905840	that's not the context that matters in the competition between places for industry.
905840	910840	If the options are between a state that has a conduit enabling lower-cost, reliable, fast
910840	916000	transportation in and out, and all other factors are the same, why would a manufacturer decide
916000	919440	to locate in the more poorly connected place?
919440	924960	The economy is a competition, and in competition, the smallest margins matter even when they
924960	928200	don't in a non-competitive context.
928200	931960	Considering the alternative was the status quo, individual states building their own
931960	937160	highways, disconnected from any national program, this program caught the states that couldn't
937160	941720	afford massive infrastructure projects, many of which were in the south and west, up to
941720	942960	the rest.
943000	948400	Therefore, interstates made these states more competitive by reducing their relative distance
948400	950080	to the rest of the world.
950080	954280	That's not to say the program was perfect, though.
954280	960400	Just as much as it proved revolutionary to more rural areas, it gutted cities.
960400	965720	Neighborhoods, predominantly poorer ones, were leveled to the ground to make space for
965720	969200	interstates and their associated infrastructure.
969200	974200	This often created clear, physical barriers between certain neighborhoods and urban centers,
974200	977920	which reduced opportunity in these excluded neighborhoods.
977920	982440	They also had the effect of encouraging reduced density, which increases the environmental
982440	987160	impact of cities, creates scenarios where job opportunity is linked to car ownership,
987160	990040	and additional potential negative impacts.
990040	996960	Altogether, the way in which interstates interact with cities was often poorly planned and executed.
996960	1002760	But when examined in aggregate, the interstate highway system is one of the best investments
1002760	1005920	the United States ever made.
1005920	1010840	While by no means unique to the United States in concept, the vastness and regional disparities
1010840	1016060	in the country meant such a system had a uniquely powerful impact.
1016060	1022380	For every dollar spent on the program, it has returned at least six in economic benefit.
1022380	1026780	In the context of nations, connectivity is power.
1026780	1031380	Therefore, the reason why the interstate highway system is the most impactful infrastructure
1031380	1038380	program in American history is simply because, as of now, it's the largest.
1038380	1043700	I definitely enjoy nerding out about the interstates, and hopefully you now do too, so I made a
1043700	1049300	whole other video about the strangest, quirkiest sections of the system, like why Interstate
1049300	1054740	180 exists, just connecting to a town of 700 and traveled on by only about 100 vehicles
1054740	1061040	per hour, or the town that essentially exists because one of the only stoplights on an interstate.
