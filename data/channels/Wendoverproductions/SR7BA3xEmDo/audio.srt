4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,500
It's really just four lanes, a median, and some on and off ramps.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,280
The Interstate Highway System is no engineering marvel, no unprecedented undertaking, no massively

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,520
innovative concept.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,920
It's a simple idea—one that arose since the earliest days of the automobile.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,460
It's not exciting, which is why it often goes so underappreciated.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:39,060
Take the Interstates away, though, and you have a weaker nation.

10
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,160
You have one with dramatically starker regional divides, one with increased decentralization—more

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,960
specifically, you have a nation absent of a noticeable portion of the late 1900s economic

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,600
development and transformation.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,200
These words, like the system itself, still aren't exciting, but put more simply, if

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,480
you are an American, regardless of whether you use the Interstate system, your life would

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,560
be noticeably different in a reality without the Interstates.

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,760
It's a single collection of roadways, with an influence so great that it permeates into

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,140
every American's life.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,340
It all started here, 102 years ago.

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,860
Seventy-nine vehicles departed from the White House's ellipse at 1115 AM on July 7th,

20
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,860
1919.

21
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,820
They snaked through the district streets before crossing into Maryland and stopping for lunch

22
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,380
in Rockville at 1230 PM.

23
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,820
The coupling on one of their kitchen trailers broke, and a car's fan belt too, but all

24
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,700
in all, it was an uneventful 7-hour, 46-mile, 74-kilometer journey to the Frederick Fairgrounds.

25
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,260
Twelve and a half hours later, they woke up, left, drove, arrived, and slept again.

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,460
This cycle repeated itself.

27
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,300
Day after day, they cut 40 or 50 or 60 miles deeper into their westward journey.

28
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:04,500
The convoy climbed through the heights of the Appalachian Mountains, trekked through

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,100
the mud of Ohio, before crossing the Mississippi River at 4.10 PM on July 22nd.

30
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,540
From there, they entered an area defined by desolation.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,980
Few dared venture west in a motor vehicle in 1919, always opting for the relative comfort

32
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,660
and speed of passenger trains.

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,620
This convoy, though, was making the journey specifically to determine just how difficult

34
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,500
this feat was—to what extent such a journey was feasible for military logistics purposes.

35
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,260
The answer came quickly.

36
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,900
Despite routing themselves on the most developed transcontinental road of the time, the Lincoln

37
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,740
Highway, they constantly had to divert around disrepair, physically disassemble covered

38
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,560
bridges to get their trucks through, and fight physics on roads too narrow for an oncoming

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,660
car to pass.

40
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,500
Gas stations were few and far between, so such travel required truly expedition-level

41
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
planning.

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,400
Each time they entered a city, though, they were greeted by hordes of intrigued locals

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,460
and dignitaries, but those crowds thinned as the convoy crawled further into the desolate

44
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
west.

45
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,940
Most, but certainly not all, of their vehicles successfully traversed the Rockies, and the

46
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,220
same can be said for their trip across some of the Lincoln Highway's roughest roads

47
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,500
in Utah.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,600
With time, though, the trend reversed, roads improved, and they finally saw pavement again

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,880
as the convoy entered California—its final state.

50
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,540
After a final evening in Oakland, California, the vehicles loaded onto a ferry, crossed

51
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,460
the bay, and made a ceremonious arrival in San Francisco accompanied by a massive parade

52
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,340
and a formal dinner.

53
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,220
That was September 6th, 1919—sixty-two days after their departure from the White House

54
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,600
Ellipse.

55
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,780
Having concentrated nearly all their waking hours on driving, the math works out to an

56
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,820
average travel speed of just 5.65 miles or 9 kilometers per hour—a staggeringly slow

57
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,740
pace on a road branded as a highway, in a year featuring technologies such as electric

58
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,520
refrigerators, airplanes, and long-distance phone service.

59
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,960
The convoy accomplished its mission of appraising the feasibility of this route for more practical

60
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,140
military purposes, but the report back to Washington was not positive.

61
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,440
One lieutenant colonel, tasked with observing the journey, wrote, quote,

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,780
"'Extended trips by trucks through the Middle Western part of the United States are impractical

63
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,860
until the roads are improved, and then only a light truck should be used on long hauls.'"

64
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,180
It was clear that, for now, until roads were improved, transcontinental motor trips would

65
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,660
remain the domain of publicity stunts and enthusiasts.

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,500
But then the years started passing.

67
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,420
Administration after administration, observing the growing presence of motor vehicles in

68
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:58,340
the lives of increasingly everyday Americans, recognized that road construction was not

69
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,380
something that could be left the responsibility of states.

70
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,220
While individual states did make plenty of progress building high-quality urban and rural

71
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,060
roads, their interests were insular.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,820
Iowa, for example, would have no interest building a highway with the primary purpose

73
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,300
of connecting Illinois to Nebraska.

74
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,380
As Americans went off to fight in Europe during World War II, they observed the efficiency

75
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,140
of Germany's national Reichsautobahn highway system, but when they returned home, they

76
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,780
were forced to navigate a patchwork of state systems of varying quality to get anywhere

77
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,340
beyond their local areas.

78
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,460
In the 1950s, when America was a near decade out from landing men on the moon, it still

79
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,000
took significant planning and the better part of ten days to reasonably traverse from one

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,860
coast to the other.

81
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,980
While this might have been inconvenient for road-tripping Americans, it mostly meant that

82
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,220
there were regions that simply could not compete with coastal areas in the industrial sector

83
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,220
due to high transport costs and times.

84
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,420
It was clear something had to change, but efforts to increase highway construction at

85
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,060
the federal level were constantly stalled by funding issues and the general lack of

86
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,340
volition.

87
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,460
But then came someone new.

88
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,700
One of the members of the 1919 Transcontinental Convoy—in fact, the very lieutenant colonel

89
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:20,340
who provided the earlier report on the journey to Washington—continued on in his military

90
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,300
career and rose through the ranks until he became supreme Allied commander of the European

91
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,460
theater in World War II.

92
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:33,060
Then, upon return to the US, he entered a political career, culminating with his inauguration

93
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,660
as president on January 20th, 1953.

94
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,340
This was, of course, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

95
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,100
With the groundwork laid by decades of planning and false starts, Eisenhower's task was

96
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,460
centered on finally finding the political will and funding to turn this concept map,

97
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:57,460
a 1955 publication by the Bureau of Public Roads, into reality.

98
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,000
After nearly three years of political maneuvering, he succeeded.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,100
On June 29th, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was signed, dedicating some $25 billion

100
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:15,660
to constructing 41,000 miles or 66,000 kilometers of highway.

101
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,540
Unlike previous attempts at similar programs, the federal government would now pay 90% of

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:26,180
the costs of these interstate highways, with individual states responsible for the rest—largely

103
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,100
funded by a hike in the federal gas tax.

104
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,460
Just three months after the bill's signing, paving work began on a section of Interstate

105
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,740
70 in Kansas, and two months after that, the same section opened to the public—representing

106
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,860
the first miles of a system that would engulf the country over the coming decades.

107
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:51,580
Now, whether it's I-40 in Tennessee or I-90 through Idaho, the way these roads were built

108
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,120
was highly, highly standardized.

109
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,000
That was, after all, the point.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,720
These standards are codified in a simple eight-page document entitled, A Policy on Design Standards

111
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,260
Interstate System.

112
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,340
To start with, fundamentally, interstates must have controlled access, meaning the manner

113
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,660
in which vehicles enter or exit the roadway must be controlled through on and off ramps.

114
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,480
That's why, unlike with many state highways, you never see intersections with stoplights

115
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,280
on interstates, except when rules are violated.

116
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,700
The standards also set out a minimum speed—50 miles or 80 kilometers per hour in urban and

117
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:37,260
mountainous areas, 70 miles or 110 kilometers per hour in rural areas, and maximum grade—up

118
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:43,860
to 7%, corresponding to 370 feet of elevation gain per mile of road, or 70 meters per kilometer,

119
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,280
depending on speed and topography.

120
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,620
There must be at least two lanes in each direction of travel, 12 feet or 3.5 meters in width,

121
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,540
with a cross slope—essentially an angle to allow for rain runoff—of at least 1.5

122
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,980
and ideally 2% grade.

123
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,540
Tunnels and bridges must have at least 16 feet or 5 meters of vertical clearance, although

124
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,300
less is allowed through urban areas as long as an alternate route with 16-foot clearance

125
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,620
is available.

126
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,340
Aside from a few smaller details, that's the entirety of the interstate highway design

127
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
standards.

128
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,380
It's incredibly simple.

129
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,900
Implementing this nationwide, however, was no simple endeavor.

130
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,700
When the project started, in the 50s, one mile of interstate cost some $8.5 million

131
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,660
to construct, or $5.3 million per kilometer, however, through the decades, as labor costs

132
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,500
rose and the simplest sections stood completed, this ramped up to over $34 million per mile,

133
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,980
or $21 million per kilometer.

134
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,180
Unsurprisingly, the interstate system quickly blew past its original $25 billion budget

135
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:53,120
allocation, but people and governments were convinced.

136
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,540
The project gained more and more funding, and was reaching completion by the time the

137
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,080
80s turned into the 90s.

138
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,960
To complete the original vision, just one last section remained—a 12.5 mile, 20 kilometer

139
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,020
stretch through Glenwood Canyon, Colorado.

140
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,540
With thousand-foot walls flanking on each side, little room exists aside the Colorado

141
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,380
River for a roadway, but a complex collection of bridges and tunnels were constructed at

142
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:26,800
a cost of $960 million, inflation adjusted, corresponding to $75 million per mile, or

143
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,120
$47 million per kilometer of roadway.

144
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,280
Once this engineering marvel was completed in 1992, however, the nation was connected,

145
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,180
and more than two decades after his death, Eisenhower's vision was realized.

146
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:49,820
His 62-day transcontinental expedition from 1919 now takes a mere 42 hours.

147
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,040
In such a decentralized country, consisting of a patchwork of states each with unique

148
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,480
governments, laws, cultures, and more, the consistency of a nationwide federal transportation

149
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,400
system is, in and of itself, unique.

150
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,100
It is one of the most regular interactions Americans, especially in far-flung western

151
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,120
and southern regions, might have with a federal program.

152
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,120
Today, the largest urban center located further than 25 miles or 40 kilometers from an interstate

153
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,220
highway is Fresno, California, with a population of about half a million.

154
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:30,600
In fact, only 14 cities with over 100,000 people are located further than this distance.

155
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,420
Even Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are now included in this program, despite the fact

156
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,300
that their interstates don't actually extend interstate.

157
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,720
With wide lanes, smooth turns, consistent grades, and more, these highways are remarkably

158
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
safe.

159
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:53,060
While nationwide the US averages 1.3 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, interstates,

160
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:59,280
for the same 100 million vehicle miles, observe just 0.55 deaths each year.

161
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,660
Incredibly, that means that, assuming the alternative is equivalent travel on non-interstate

162
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:11,260
roads, this system is responsible for saving about 6,500 lives per year.

163
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,380
Beyond the moral component—the innate human desire to preserve life—the US Department

164
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:22,280
of Transportation, on a statistical basis, values a human life at $11.7 million when

165
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,600
evaluating potential safety standards, so the safety profile of the interstate highway

166
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,200
system by itself has a theoretical economic impact of about $75 billion per year, therefore

167
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,320
easily justifying its cost alone.

168
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,160
But then there's the more direct impacts.

169
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,120
Among the more populated states, construction disproportionately took place in southern

170
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,040
states such as Georgia, South Carolina, or Arkansas, on a basis of miles constructed

171
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
per capita.

172
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,900
Then, in less populous states, the interstate disproportionately penetrated the American

173
00:12:53,900 --> 00:13:00,120
West, with states such as Utah, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming receiving the most miles per capita.

174
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,400
Therefore, it was the south and west that received the greatest impact.

175
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,520
In essence, what these roadways did was connect the US's economic centers to the periphery,

176
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,860
so the periphery had the most to gain by, effectively, reducing the relative distance

177
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,780
to centers by a factor of 30%, on average.

178
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:24,280
In the case of Interstate 5, for example, which runs along the entire west coast from

179
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,040
the border to Mexico to that with Canada, California, the state that encompasses the

180
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,240
majority of its distance actually sees the smallest benefit.

181
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,800
That's not to say the benefit is small—the removal of the interstate would correspond

182
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,160
to a 6% loss in overall income in the state—but Oregon, the 12th most sparsely populated state

183
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,560
in the nation, would lose 15% of its income if I-5 simply disappeared.

184
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:55,720
It's worth fully considering just how staggering that statistic is.

185
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:03,400
A single, simple, four-lane roadway, stretching some 300 miles or 500 kilometers through Oregon,

186
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,900
attributable for 15% of its income.

187
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,640
This does, however, make sense.

188
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,720
Oregon's economy, significantly undergirded by the natural resources, manufacturing, and

189
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,740
agricultural sectors, is highly trade-dependent.

190
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,680
The state does not, however, have any major export ports, so when a manufacturer in Salem,

191
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,280
Oregon, for example, needs to transport the finished products to the Port of Oakland,

192
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,080
it would likely hire a truck to take the nine-hour journey south on I-5.

193
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,880
The shortest non-interstate route, however, would take 13 and a half hours on roads with

194
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:45,200
potentially burdensome weight restrictions, inadequate facilities, low bridges, and other

195
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
constraints.

196
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,920
It just makes getting product out harder.

197
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,120
Now, ultimately, transport cost is rarely an enormous portion of a given product's

198
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,400
cost—a five-cent increase on a $10 product produced further from Oakland isn't massive—but

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,840
that's not the context that matters in the competition between places for industry.

200
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:10,840
If the options are between a state that has a conduit enabling lower-cost, reliable, fast

201
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,000
transportation in and out, and all other factors are the same, why would a manufacturer decide

202
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,440
to locate in the more poorly connected place?

203
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,960
The economy is a competition, and in competition, the smallest margins matter even when they

204
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,200
don't in a non-competitive context.

205
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,960
Considering the alternative was the status quo, individual states building their own

206
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,160
highways, disconnected from any national program, this program caught the states that couldn't

207
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,720
afford massive infrastructure projects, many of which were in the south and west, up to

208
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,960
the rest.

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Therefore, interstates made these states more competitive by reducing their relative distance

210
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,080
to the rest of the world.

211
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,280
That's not to say the program was perfect, though.

212
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,400
Just as much as it proved revolutionary to more rural areas, it gutted cities.

213
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,720
Neighborhoods, predominantly poorer ones, were leveled to the ground to make space for

214
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,200
interstates and their associated infrastructure.

215
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
This often created clear, physical barriers between certain neighborhoods and urban centers,

216
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,920
which reduced opportunity in these excluded neighborhoods.

217
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,440
They also had the effect of encouraging reduced density, which increases the environmental

218
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,160
impact of cities, creates scenarios where job opportunity is linked to car ownership,

219
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,040
and additional potential negative impacts.

220
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:36,960
Altogether, the way in which interstates interact with cities was often poorly planned and executed.

221
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,760
But when examined in aggregate, the interstate highway system is one of the best investments

222
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,920
the United States ever made.

223
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,840
While by no means unique to the United States in concept, the vastness and regional disparities

224
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,060
in the country meant such a system had a uniquely powerful impact.

225
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,380
For every dollar spent on the program, it has returned at least six in economic benefit.

226
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,780
In the context of nations, connectivity is power.

227
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,380
Therefore, the reason why the interstate highway system is the most impactful infrastructure

228
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:18,380
program in American history is simply because, as of now, it's the largest.

229
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,700
I definitely enjoy nerding out about the interstates, and hopefully you now do too, so I made a

230
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,300
whole other video about the strangest, quirkiest sections of the system, like why Interstate

231
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:34,740
180 exists, just connecting to a town of 700 and traveled on by only about 100 vehicles

232
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:41,040
per hour, or the town that essentially exists because one of the only stoplights on an interstate.

233
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:46,220
You can watch that video on Nebula, the streaming site founded by myself and loads of your favorite

234
