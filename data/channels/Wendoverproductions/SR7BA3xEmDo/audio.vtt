00:09.840 --> 00:15.500
It's really just four lanes, a median, and some on and off ramps.

00:15.500 --> 00:22.280
The Interstate Highway System is no engineering marvel, no unprecedented undertaking, no massively

00:22.280 --> 00:23.520
innovative concept.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.920
It's a simple idea—one that arose since the earliest days of the automobile.

00:28.920 --> 00:34.460
It's not exciting, which is why it often goes so underappreciated.

00:34.460 --> 00:39.060
Take the Interstates away, though, and you have a weaker nation.

00:39.060 --> 00:45.160
You have one with dramatically starker regional divides, one with increased decentralization—more

00:45.160 --> 00:50.960
specifically, you have a nation absent of a noticeable portion of the late 1900s economic

00:50.960 --> 00:53.600
development and transformation.

00:53.600 --> 00:59.200
These words, like the system itself, still aren't exciting, but put more simply, if

00:59.200 --> 01:04.480
you are an American, regardless of whether you use the Interstate system, your life would

01:04.480 --> 01:08.560
be noticeably different in a reality without the Interstates.

01:08.560 --> 01:14.760
It's a single collection of roadways, with an influence so great that it permeates into

01:14.760 --> 01:18.140
every American's life.

01:18.140 --> 01:22.340
It all started here, 102 years ago.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.860
Seventy-nine vehicles departed from the White House's ellipse at 1115 AM on July 7th,

01:27.860 --> 01:28.860
1919.

01:28.860 --> 01:32.820
They snaked through the district streets before crossing into Maryland and stopping for lunch

01:32.820 --> 01:35.380
in Rockville at 1230 PM.

01:35.380 --> 01:39.820
The coupling on one of their kitchen trailers broke, and a car's fan belt too, but all

01:39.820 --> 01:46.700
in all, it was an uneventful 7-hour, 46-mile, 74-kilometer journey to the Frederick Fairgrounds.

01:47.260 --> 01:53.260
Twelve and a half hours later, they woke up, left, drove, arrived, and slept again.

01:53.260 --> 01:55.460
This cycle repeated itself.

01:55.460 --> 02:01.300
Day after day, they cut 40 or 50 or 60 miles deeper into their westward journey.

02:01.300 --> 02:04.500
The convoy climbed through the heights of the Appalachian Mountains, trekked through

02:04.500 --> 02:11.100
the mud of Ohio, before crossing the Mississippi River at 4.10 PM on July 22nd.

02:11.100 --> 02:15.540
From there, they entered an area defined by desolation.

02:15.540 --> 02:20.980
Few dared venture west in a motor vehicle in 1919, always opting for the relative comfort

02:20.980 --> 02:23.660
and speed of passenger trains.

02:23.660 --> 02:28.620
This convoy, though, was making the journey specifically to determine just how difficult

02:28.620 --> 02:35.500
this feat was—to what extent such a journey was feasible for military logistics purposes.

02:35.500 --> 02:38.260
The answer came quickly.

02:38.260 --> 02:42.900
Despite routing themselves on the most developed transcontinental road of the time, the Lincoln

02:42.900 --> 02:47.740
Highway, they constantly had to divert around disrepair, physically disassemble covered

02:47.740 --> 02:52.560
bridges to get their trucks through, and fight physics on roads too narrow for an oncoming

02:52.560 --> 02:54.660
car to pass.

02:54.660 --> 03:00.500
Gas stations were few and far between, so such travel required truly expedition-level

03:00.500 --> 03:01.500
planning.

03:01.500 --> 03:05.400
Each time they entered a city, though, they were greeted by hordes of intrigued locals

03:05.400 --> 03:10.460
and dignitaries, but those crowds thinned as the convoy crawled further into the desolate

03:10.460 --> 03:11.460
west.

03:11.460 --> 03:16.940
Most, but certainly not all, of their vehicles successfully traversed the Rockies, and the

03:16.940 --> 03:21.220
same can be said for their trip across some of the Lincoln Highway's roughest roads

03:21.220 --> 03:22.500
in Utah.

03:22.500 --> 03:27.600
With time, though, the trend reversed, roads improved, and they finally saw pavement again

03:27.600 --> 03:31.880
as the convoy entered California—its final state.

03:31.880 --> 03:36.540
After a final evening in Oakland, California, the vehicles loaded onto a ferry, crossed

03:36.540 --> 03:42.460
the bay, and made a ceremonious arrival in San Francisco accompanied by a massive parade

03:42.460 --> 03:44.340
and a formal dinner.

03:44.340 --> 03:51.220
That was September 6th, 1919—sixty-two days after their departure from the White House

03:51.220 --> 03:52.600
Ellipse.

03:52.600 --> 03:56.780
Having concentrated nearly all their waking hours on driving, the math works out to an

03:56.780 --> 04:02.820
average travel speed of just 5.65 miles or 9 kilometers per hour—a staggeringly slow

04:02.820 --> 04:07.740
pace on a road branded as a highway, in a year featuring technologies such as electric

04:07.740 --> 04:11.520
refrigerators, airplanes, and long-distance phone service.

04:11.520 --> 04:15.960
The convoy accomplished its mission of appraising the feasibility of this route for more practical

04:15.960 --> 04:21.140
military purposes, but the report back to Washington was not positive.

04:21.140 --> 04:25.440
One lieutenant colonel, tasked with observing the journey, wrote, quote,

04:25.440 --> 04:29.780
"'Extended trips by trucks through the Middle Western part of the United States are impractical

04:29.780 --> 04:35.860
until the roads are improved, and then only a light truck should be used on long hauls.'"

04:35.860 --> 04:41.180
It was clear that, for now, until roads were improved, transcontinental motor trips would

04:41.180 --> 04:45.660
remain the domain of publicity stunts and enthusiasts.

04:45.660 --> 04:49.500
But then the years started passing.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.420
Administration after administration, observing the growing presence of motor vehicles in

04:53.420 --> 04:58.340
the lives of increasingly everyday Americans, recognized that road construction was not

04:58.340 --> 05:01.380
something that could be left the responsibility of states.

05:01.380 --> 05:06.220
While individual states did make plenty of progress building high-quality urban and rural

05:06.220 --> 05:09.060
roads, their interests were insular.

05:09.060 --> 05:13.820
Iowa, for example, would have no interest building a highway with the primary purpose

05:13.820 --> 05:16.300
of connecting Illinois to Nebraska.

05:16.300 --> 05:20.380
As Americans went off to fight in Europe during World War II, they observed the efficiency

05:20.380 --> 05:25.140
of Germany's national Reichsautobahn highway system, but when they returned home, they

05:25.140 --> 05:29.780
were forced to navigate a patchwork of state systems of varying quality to get anywhere

05:29.780 --> 05:32.340
beyond their local areas.

05:32.340 --> 05:37.460
In the 1950s, when America was a near decade out from landing men on the moon, it still

05:37.460 --> 05:43.000
took significant planning and the better part of ten days to reasonably traverse from one

05:43.000 --> 05:44.860
coast to the other.

05:44.860 --> 05:48.980
While this might have been inconvenient for road-tripping Americans, it mostly meant that

05:48.980 --> 05:54.220
there were regions that simply could not compete with coastal areas in the industrial sector

05:54.220 --> 05:57.220
due to high transport costs and times.

05:57.220 --> 06:01.420
It was clear something had to change, but efforts to increase highway construction at

06:01.420 --> 06:06.060
the federal level were constantly stalled by funding issues and the general lack of

06:06.060 --> 06:07.340
volition.

06:07.340 --> 06:10.460
But then came someone new.

06:10.460 --> 06:15.700
One of the members of the 1919 Transcontinental Convoy—in fact, the very lieutenant colonel

06:15.700 --> 06:20.340
who provided the earlier report on the journey to Washington—continued on in his military

06:20.340 --> 06:25.300
career and rose through the ranks until he became supreme Allied commander of the European

06:25.300 --> 06:27.460
theater in World War II.

06:27.460 --> 06:33.060
Then, upon return to the US, he entered a political career, culminating with his inauguration

06:33.060 --> 06:37.660
as president on January 20th, 1953.

06:37.660 --> 06:42.340
This was, of course, Dwight D. Eisenhower.

06:42.340 --> 06:47.100
With the groundwork laid by decades of planning and false starts, Eisenhower's task was

06:47.100 --> 06:52.460
centered on finally finding the political will and funding to turn this concept map,

06:52.460 --> 06:57.460
a 1955 publication by the Bureau of Public Roads, into reality.

06:57.460 --> 07:02.000
After nearly three years of political maneuvering, he succeeded.

07:02.000 --> 07:10.100
On June 29th, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 was signed, dedicating some $25 billion

07:10.100 --> 07:15.660
to constructing 41,000 miles or 66,000 kilometers of highway.

07:15.660 --> 07:20.540
Unlike previous attempts at similar programs, the federal government would now pay 90% of

07:20.540 --> 07:26.180
the costs of these interstate highways, with individual states responsible for the rest—largely

07:26.180 --> 07:29.100
funded by a hike in the federal gas tax.

07:29.100 --> 07:33.460
Just three months after the bill's signing, paving work began on a section of Interstate

07:33.460 --> 07:39.740
70 in Kansas, and two months after that, the same section opened to the public—representing

07:39.740 --> 07:44.860
the first miles of a system that would engulf the country over the coming decades.

07:45.060 --> 07:51.580
Now, whether it's I-40 in Tennessee or I-90 through Idaho, the way these roads were built

07:51.580 --> 07:55.120
was highly, highly standardized.

07:55.120 --> 07:58.000
That was, after all, the point.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.720
These standards are codified in a simple eight-page document entitled, A Policy on Design Standards

08:03.720 --> 08:05.260
Interstate System.

08:05.260 --> 08:11.340
To start with, fundamentally, interstates must have controlled access, meaning the manner

08:11.340 --> 08:16.660
in which vehicles enter or exit the roadway must be controlled through on and off ramps.

08:16.660 --> 08:21.480
That's why, unlike with many state highways, you never see intersections with stoplights

08:21.480 --> 08:25.280
on interstates, except when rules are violated.

08:25.280 --> 08:30.700
The standards also set out a minimum speed—50 miles or 80 kilometers per hour in urban and

08:30.700 --> 08:37.260
mountainous areas, 70 miles or 110 kilometers per hour in rural areas, and maximum grade—up

08:37.260 --> 08:43.860
to 7%, corresponding to 370 feet of elevation gain per mile of road, or 70 meters per kilometer,

08:43.860 --> 08:46.280
depending on speed and topography.

08:46.280 --> 08:51.620
There must be at least two lanes in each direction of travel, 12 feet or 3.5 meters in width,

08:51.620 --> 08:56.540
with a cross slope—essentially an angle to allow for rain runoff—of at least 1.5

08:56.540 --> 08:58.980
and ideally 2% grade.

08:58.980 --> 09:03.540
Tunnels and bridges must have at least 16 feet or 5 meters of vertical clearance, although

09:03.540 --> 09:08.300
less is allowed through urban areas as long as an alternate route with 16-foot clearance

09:08.300 --> 09:09.620
is available.

09:09.620 --> 09:15.340
Aside from a few smaller details, that's the entirety of the interstate highway design

09:15.340 --> 09:16.340
standards.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.380
It's incredibly simple.

09:18.380 --> 09:22.900
Implementing this nationwide, however, was no simple endeavor.

09:22.900 --> 09:29.700
When the project started, in the 50s, one mile of interstate cost some $8.5 million

09:29.700 --> 09:35.660
to construct, or $5.3 million per kilometer, however, through the decades, as labor costs

09:35.660 --> 09:41.500
rose and the simplest sections stood completed, this ramped up to over $34 million per mile,

09:41.500 --> 09:43.980
or $21 million per kilometer.

09:43.980 --> 09:49.180
Unsurprisingly, the interstate system quickly blew past its original $25 billion budget

09:49.180 --> 09:53.120
allocation, but people and governments were convinced.

09:53.120 --> 09:57.540
The project gained more and more funding, and was reaching completion by the time the

09:57.540 --> 10:00.080
80s turned into the 90s.

10:00.080 --> 10:06.960
To complete the original vision, just one last section remained—a 12.5 mile, 20 kilometer

10:06.960 --> 10:10.020
stretch through Glenwood Canyon, Colorado.

10:10.020 --> 10:14.540
With thousand-foot walls flanking on each side, little room exists aside the Colorado

10:14.540 --> 10:19.380
River for a roadway, but a complex collection of bridges and tunnels were constructed at

10:19.380 --> 10:26.800
a cost of $960 million, inflation adjusted, corresponding to $75 million per mile, or

10:26.800 --> 10:30.120
$47 million per kilometer of roadway.

10:30.120 --> 10:35.280
Once this engineering marvel was completed in 1992, however, the nation was connected,

10:35.280 --> 10:41.180
and more than two decades after his death, Eisenhower's vision was realized.

10:41.180 --> 10:49.820
His 62-day transcontinental expedition from 1919 now takes a mere 42 hours.

10:49.820 --> 10:55.040
In such a decentralized country, consisting of a patchwork of states each with unique

10:55.040 --> 11:00.480
governments, laws, cultures, and more, the consistency of a nationwide federal transportation

11:00.480 --> 11:03.400
system is, in and of itself, unique.

11:03.400 --> 11:08.100
It is one of the most regular interactions Americans, especially in far-flung western

11:08.100 --> 11:12.120
and southern regions, might have with a federal program.

11:12.120 --> 11:18.120
Today, the largest urban center located further than 25 miles or 40 kilometers from an interstate

11:18.120 --> 11:23.220
highway is Fresno, California, with a population of about half a million.

11:23.220 --> 11:30.600
In fact, only 14 cities with over 100,000 people are located further than this distance.

11:30.600 --> 11:35.420
Even Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are now included in this program, despite the fact

11:35.420 --> 11:39.300
that their interstates don't actually extend interstate.

11:39.300 --> 11:45.720
With wide lanes, smooth turns, consistent grades, and more, these highways are remarkably

11:45.720 --> 11:46.720
safe.

11:46.720 --> 11:53.060
While nationwide the US averages 1.3 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, interstates,

11:53.060 --> 11:59.280
for the same 100 million vehicle miles, observe just 0.55 deaths each year.

11:59.280 --> 12:04.660
Incredibly, that means that, assuming the alternative is equivalent travel on non-interstate

12:04.660 --> 12:11.260
roads, this system is responsible for saving about 6,500 lives per year.

12:11.260 --> 12:16.380
Beyond the moral component—the innate human desire to preserve life—the US Department

12:16.380 --> 12:22.280
of Transportation, on a statistical basis, values a human life at $11.7 million when

12:22.280 --> 12:26.600
evaluating potential safety standards, so the safety profile of the interstate highway

12:26.600 --> 12:33.200
system by itself has a theoretical economic impact of about $75 billion per year, therefore

12:33.200 --> 12:36.320
easily justifying its cost alone.

12:36.320 --> 12:39.160
But then there's the more direct impacts.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.120
Among the more populated states, construction disproportionately took place in southern

12:43.120 --> 12:48.040
states such as Georgia, South Carolina, or Arkansas, on a basis of miles constructed

12:48.040 --> 12:49.040
per capita.

12:49.040 --> 12:53.900
Then, in less populous states, the interstate disproportionately penetrated the American

12:53.900 --> 13:00.120
West, with states such as Utah, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming receiving the most miles per capita.

13:00.120 --> 13:05.400
Therefore, it was the south and west that received the greatest impact.

13:05.400 --> 13:11.520
In essence, what these roadways did was connect the US's economic centers to the periphery,

13:11.520 --> 13:15.860
so the periphery had the most to gain by, effectively, reducing the relative distance

13:15.860 --> 13:19.780
to centers by a factor of 30%, on average.

13:19.780 --> 13:24.280
In the case of Interstate 5, for example, which runs along the entire west coast from

13:24.280 --> 13:29.040
the border to Mexico to that with Canada, California, the state that encompasses the

13:29.040 --> 13:33.240
majority of its distance actually sees the smallest benefit.

13:33.240 --> 13:37.800
That's not to say the benefit is small—the removal of the interstate would correspond

13:37.800 --> 13:44.160
to a 6% loss in overall income in the state—but Oregon, the 12th most sparsely populated state

13:44.160 --> 13:49.560
in the nation, would lose 15% of its income if I-5 simply disappeared.

13:49.560 --> 13:55.720
It's worth fully considering just how staggering that statistic is.

13:55.720 --> 14:03.400
A single, simple, four-lane roadway, stretching some 300 miles or 500 kilometers through Oregon,

14:03.400 --> 14:07.900
attributable for 15% of its income.

14:07.900 --> 14:10.640
This does, however, make sense.

14:10.640 --> 14:15.720
Oregon's economy, significantly undergirded by the natural resources, manufacturing, and

14:15.720 --> 14:19.740
agricultural sectors, is highly trade-dependent.

14:19.740 --> 14:25.680
The state does not, however, have any major export ports, so when a manufacturer in Salem,

14:25.680 --> 14:30.280
Oregon, for example, needs to transport the finished products to the Port of Oakland,

14:30.280 --> 14:35.080
it would likely hire a truck to take the nine-hour journey south on I-5.

14:35.080 --> 14:39.880
The shortest non-interstate route, however, would take 13 and a half hours on roads with

14:39.880 --> 14:45.200
potentially burdensome weight restrictions, inadequate facilities, low bridges, and other

14:45.200 --> 14:46.200
constraints.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.920
It just makes getting product out harder.

14:49.280 --> 14:55.120
Now, ultimately, transport cost is rarely an enormous portion of a given product's

14:55.120 --> 15:00.400
cost—a five-cent increase on a $10 product produced further from Oakland isn't massive—but

15:00.400 --> 15:05.840
that's not the context that matters in the competition between places for industry.

15:05.840 --> 15:10.840
If the options are between a state that has a conduit enabling lower-cost, reliable, fast

15:10.840 --> 15:16.000
transportation in and out, and all other factors are the same, why would a manufacturer decide

15:16.000 --> 15:19.440
to locate in the more poorly connected place?

15:19.440 --> 15:24.960
The economy is a competition, and in competition, the smallest margins matter even when they

15:24.960 --> 15:28.200
don't in a non-competitive context.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.960
Considering the alternative was the status quo, individual states building their own

15:31.960 --> 15:37.160
highways, disconnected from any national program, this program caught the states that couldn't

15:37.160 --> 15:41.720
afford massive infrastructure projects, many of which were in the south and west, up to

15:41.720 --> 15:42.960
the rest.

15:43.000 --> 15:48.400
Therefore, interstates made these states more competitive by reducing their relative distance

15:48.400 --> 15:50.080
to the rest of the world.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.280
That's not to say the program was perfect, though.

15:54.280 --> 16:00.400
Just as much as it proved revolutionary to more rural areas, it gutted cities.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.720
Neighborhoods, predominantly poorer ones, were leveled to the ground to make space for

16:05.720 --> 16:09.200
interstates and their associated infrastructure.

16:09.200 --> 16:14.200
This often created clear, physical barriers between certain neighborhoods and urban centers,

16:14.200 --> 16:17.920
which reduced opportunity in these excluded neighborhoods.

16:17.920 --> 16:22.440
They also had the effect of encouraging reduced density, which increases the environmental

16:22.440 --> 16:27.160
impact of cities, creates scenarios where job opportunity is linked to car ownership,

16:27.160 --> 16:30.040
and additional potential negative impacts.

16:30.040 --> 16:36.960
Altogether, the way in which interstates interact with cities was often poorly planned and executed.

16:36.960 --> 16:42.760
But when examined in aggregate, the interstate highway system is one of the best investments

16:42.760 --> 16:45.920
the United States ever made.

16:45.920 --> 16:50.840
While by no means unique to the United States in concept, the vastness and regional disparities

16:50.840 --> 16:56.060
in the country meant such a system had a uniquely powerful impact.

16:56.060 --> 17:02.380
For every dollar spent on the program, it has returned at least six in economic benefit.

17:02.380 --> 17:06.780
In the context of nations, connectivity is power.

17:06.780 --> 17:11.380
Therefore, the reason why the interstate highway system is the most impactful infrastructure

17:11.380 --> 17:18.380
program in American history is simply because, as of now, it's the largest.

17:18.380 --> 17:23.700
I definitely enjoy nerding out about the interstates, and hopefully you now do too, so I made a

17:23.700 --> 17:29.300
whole other video about the strangest, quirkiest sections of the system, like why Interstate

17:29.300 --> 17:34.740
180 exists, just connecting to a town of 700 and traveled on by only about 100 vehicles

17:34.740 --> 17:41.040
per hour, or the town that essentially exists because one of the only stoplights on an interstate.

17:41.040 --> 17:46.220
You can watch that video on Nebula, the streaming site founded by myself and loads of your favorite

17:46.220 --> 17:47.700
educational creators.

17:47.700 --> 17:52.100
There's no algorithm, meaning we can upload without worrying about how clickbait-y a video

17:52.100 --> 17:57.380
is, and no ads or sponsorships, meaning you can just enjoy the videos themselves.

17:57.380 --> 18:03.240
Plus, we regularly release exclusive companion videos, extended cuts, big-budget originals,

18:03.240 --> 18:04.240
and more.

18:04.240 --> 18:09.200
What makes Nebula even better is the best way to get access to it—the CuriosityStream

18:09.200 --> 18:10.200
bundle deal.

18:10.200 --> 18:14.080
You sign up through them, and then you also get access to CuriosityStream, home to an

18:14.080 --> 18:18.400
enormous catalog of top-quality non-fiction shows and documentaries, like Highway to the

18:18.400 --> 18:22.920
Arctic, about Canada's annual endeavor to build ice roads through its frozen north to

18:22.920 --> 18:27.840
provide a seasonal road connection for many of its most isolated villages.

18:27.840 --> 18:32.680
Nebula and CuriosityStream are both fantastic streaming sites that I find myself regularly

18:32.680 --> 18:39.960
using, and they come at an incredible price—just $14.79 a year with the current sale at curiositystream.com

18:39.960 --> 18:42.920
slash wendover or by clicking this button.

18:42.920 --> 18:47.680
That's all our regular videos early and ad-free, exclusive companion videos, big-budget

18:47.680 --> 18:52.000
Nebula originals, and an enormous number of non-fiction shows and documentaries for an

18:52.000 --> 18:56.360
annual price similar to what you probably pay monthly for other streaming sites, and

18:56.360 --> 19:02.440
