10060	18960	Imagine a $2,000 car, or a $100 laptop, or a $70 iPhone, or imagine any product ten times
18960	21160	cheaper than it was.
21160	24360	Imagine the fundamental market change that would bring.
24360	29460	Imagine the amount of demand there would be for that $2,000 car, or a $100 laptop,
29460	30800	or a $70 iPhone.
30800	37880	That's what Elon Musk imagined 15 years ago when he sat on a pile of $165 million.
37880	42660	Elon Musk's businesses are all centered around some of the most basic principles of
42660	44360	economics out there.
44360	48620	When he starts a business, he's not necessarily trying to do something new, he's trying
48620	50320	to do something right.
50320	53980	Musk made most of his early fortune through his involvement with PayPal.
53980	59060	In 1999 he founded a company called x.com which was quickly bought by Confinity, the
59060	65620	creators of PayPal, so when PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Musk's 11.7% ownership
65620	70180	of the company translated to $165 million.
70180	76060	Elon Musk has always been deeply passionate about space exploration and, as anyone knows,
76060	79780	public interest in space has been falling since the Apollo era.
79780	84520	Therefore, Musk's plan with his newfound fortune was to launch a rocket to Mars carrying
84520	89140	a small greenhouse that would grow plants on the surface of the red planet.
89140	93300	Basically, he wanted to take all his money and put it into a big publicity stunt for
93300	97840	space exploration, but he had a problem—it was too expensive.
97840	103820	The cost of launches was absolutely immense and, even when Musk tried to buy decommissioned
103820	109100	Russian ICBMs, he couldn't find a way to pull off the project, but he had discovered
109100	112380	something—the space launch industry was ripe for disruption.
112380	116460	Here's Joseph, the economics expert from RealLifeLore to explain why.
116460	122220	The rocket development and space launch companies before SpaceX were essentially aggregators.
122220	126060	They bought engines and guidance systems and all the other various components from other
126060	129280	companies to cobble together one completed rocket.
129280	133240	But all the different component suppliers also had their own component suppliers to
133240	134700	make their product.
134700	139500	The suppliers of the suppliers not only had to cover their development and manufacturing
139500	143680	costs, they had to sell their components at a markup in order to make a profit.
143680	147300	And then the next component manufacturer had to do the same, which means that by the time
147300	151660	the component gets to the company that's assembling the rocket, it's expensive.
151660	156200	Not only that, but the assembly company also has to pay for employees that work to actually
156200	159440	figure out how to make all of the different pieces work together.
159440	161840	SpaceX, however, works differently.
161840	167780	It makes 85% of the components it uses itself, which allows it to make cheaper parts.
167780	172680	For example, if SpaceX had bought their radios externally, they would be paying $50,000 to
172680	174680	$100,000 each.
174680	180300	But since they developed them internally, they only cost $5,000 each to build—a dramatic
180300	182580	improvement in reducing cost.
182580	186960	Joseph from RealLifeLore has a brand new book which includes two fantastic chapters explaining
186960	191320	simple economic concepts like this that I'll link in the description, but let's talk
191320	192320	Tesla.
192320	196120	Tesla's economic strategy is fairly similar to SpaceX's.
196120	202980	Tesla themselves makes about 80% of the 5,300 parts in a Tesla car, but for the most part
202980	206920	it doesn't make these—the batteries, at least yet.
206920	212060	Batteries are very difficult to make at a competitive price so very few companies do.
212060	218720	The largest three manufacturers—Panasonic, BYD, and LG Chem—make a combined 63% of
218720	219940	the world's batteries.
219940	224700	Tesla, therefore, has historically just bought batteries from Panasonic at a cost of about
224700	230580	$200 per kilowatt hour, but that means that Tesla's smallest battery pack—the 50 kilowatt
230580	235400	hour version—costs $10,000 just in components.
235400	240620	When you're trying to sell a $35,000 car and make a profit, that's a significant
240620	242660	cost that can be reduced.
242660	247680	Therefore, Tesla is attempting to reduce the cost of their batteries by 30% by building
247680	251100	their own factory in a joint venture with Panasonic.
251100	256220	Their long-term goal, however, is to drop the battery price below $100 per kilowatt
256220	261180	hour which would either double the range or halve the price of that 50 kilowatt hour battery
261180	262180	pack.
262180	266340	But the vertical integration of Tesla and SpaceX isn't all useful.
266340	271460	The companies basically have to learn and perfect each step in the manufacturing process
271460	275600	and, if one step isn't working, no cars get made.
275600	281400	For example, the Tesla Model 3, the low-cost Tesla, is built using steel instead of aluminum
281400	283220	like the Model S and X.
283220	287820	With this change, the manufacturer is having troubles properly welding the vehicle bodies
287820	292760	together and so the entire production line is slowed down massively.
292760	297020	But there's something else unique about SpaceX and Tesla's production lines—they're
297020	298020	in the US.
298020	300200	Now this probably seems counter-intuitive.
300200	304240	Why would you put the production lines of two companies working to make the least expensive
304240	308640	products on the market in one of the most expensive labor markets in the world?
308640	313480	Almost every US company has relocated their production lines to cheaper labor markets
313480	318240	in Asia and Africa but Musk has always had his in the US.
318240	321040	Believe it or not, this isn't a PR move.
321040	323920	It actually makes sense for the two companies.
323920	328540	Tesla and SpaceX's production processes are constantly being tweaked and optimized
328540	331220	as the companies learn to make their products.
331220	336480	While China might be able to build Tesla cars at the same price by using cheaper human labor,
336480	341660	Tesla's US factory is just miles away from its headquarters in Palo Alto meaning that
341660	347080	the executive, development, and production staff are all heavily integrated and can make
347080	348840	changes fast.
348840	354120	SpaceX even takes this a step further—its offices and manufacturing lines are all under
354120	355160	one roof.
355160	360540	The Tesla factory in particular is also heavily automatized and the US excels in production
360540	363980	line automation with its abundance of highly sealed workers.
363980	367460	But just how much is Musk dropping the price on his products?
367460	371880	The United Launch Alliance, which historically has won most of the highly lucrative US government
371880	377700	launch contracts, is believed to charge more than $400 million dollars all in for a military
377700	381840	satellite launch while SpaceX charges about $80 million dollars.
381840	387260	So SpaceX is already at a fifth of the price but, as mentioned, Elon Musk wants that to
387260	388520	fall to a tenth.
388520	390160	Here's the key for that.
390160	395600	The fuel used in the Falcon 9 rocket only costs about $200,000 per launch.
395600	398560	It's practically a non-factor in the launch price.
398560	404000	The real cost is of the rockets themselves so that's why SpaceX is making them reusable.
404000	408200	The first stage of the rocket is now being designed to land back on earth and be put
408200	411400	back into service with dozens of more launches.
411400	415480	Once this system becomes reliable, it's believed that the cost savings will drop the
415480	420760	launch price to $40 million dollars—a full ten times cheaper than the United Launch Alliance's
420760	422200	military launch price.
422200	427440	SpaceX's long-term goal is to get the launch price down to about $10 million dollars per
427440	428440	launch.
428440	432920	While this has already made a significant impact on the space industry, a launch price
432920	437320	as low as this would fundamentally change what's possible in space.
437320	441260	Real space tourism would become feasible, commercial satellites would become downright
441260	445280	commonplace, and space would become closer than it's ever been.
445280	448000	But SpaceX does have a bit of a problem.
448000	452000	People aren't really buying more rocket launches even though prices are down.
452000	455080	It's what's known as a price inelastic market.
455120	460000	That's the opposite of Tesla and the electric vehicle market where lower prices lead to
460000	462400	huge increases in sales.
462400	466480	The problem with the space launch market is that it is not a consumer market.
466480	468960	Normal people don't buy rocket launches.
468960	473320	Governments buy rocket launches and they don't care about price nearly as much as people
473320	475520	since it's not the decision maker's money.
475520	480040	The US Air Force, for example, decides they need to launch a certain number of satellites
480040	484640	each year for national security reasons and they'll pay whatever it takes.
484640	488240	But Elon Musk's life goal is to get humanity to Mars.
488240	492280	That's why SpaceX exists and he needs money to do it.
492280	493280	Lots of money.
493280	496560	So, SpaceX is getting into the internet business.
496560	501120	The company is actively developing a satellite constellation that would provide high-speed
501120	503160	internet to anywhere on earth.
503160	508280	Thousands of small satellites would be put into low earth orbit and then anyone worldwide
508280	512020	could hook into the network using an inexpensive ground receiver.
512020	518180	If SpaceX got just 50 million users out of the 7 billion in its proposed service area,
518180	521960	this business could bring in $30 billion a year.
521960	526100	Since SpaceX would be building and launching the satellites themselves, costs would be
526100	529060	dramatically lower than the competitions.
529060	535660	The whole commercial aspect of SpaceX essentially exists to fund Musk's future space exploration
535660	536780	projects.
536780	540580	For that reason, SpaceX is not a public company like Tesla.
540620	544020	Elon Musk does not want to make money with SpaceX.
544020	545700	He wants to get to Mars.
545700	549580	He does not want to be beholden to shareholders and profitability.
549580	554460	Musk has therefore publicly said that SpaceX will not go public until the company achieves
554460	559180	regular flights to and from Mars and thanks to the entrepreneur's understanding of basic
559180	563180	economics, that might not be too far off.
563180	567860	If you're looking to start a company, you'll need not only an understanding of basic economics
567860	569780	but also a domain.
