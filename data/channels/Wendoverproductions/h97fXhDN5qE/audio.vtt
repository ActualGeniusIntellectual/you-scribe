Imagine a $2,000 car, or a $100 laptop, or a $70 iPhone, or imagine any product ten times

00:18.960 --> 00:21.160
cheaper than it was.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.360
Imagine the fundamental market change that would bring.

00:24.360 --> 00:29.460
Imagine the amount of demand there would be for that $2,000 car, or a $100 laptop,

00:29.460 --> 00:30.800
or a $70 iPhone.

00:30.800 --> 00:37.880
That's what Elon Musk imagined 15 years ago when he sat on a pile of $165 million.

00:37.880 --> 00:42.660
Elon Musk's businesses are all centered around some of the most basic principles of

00:42.660 --> 00:44.360
economics out there.

00:44.360 --> 00:48.620
When he starts a business, he's not necessarily trying to do something new, he's trying

00:48.620 --> 00:50.320
to do something right.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.980
Musk made most of his early fortune through his involvement with PayPal.

00:53.980 --> 00:59.060
In 1999 he founded a company called x.com which was quickly bought by Confinity, the

00:59.060 --> 01:05.620
creators of PayPal, so when PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Musk's 11.7% ownership

01:05.620 --> 01:10.180
of the company translated to $165 million.

01:10.180 --> 01:16.060
Elon Musk has always been deeply passionate about space exploration and, as anyone knows,

01:16.060 --> 01:19.780
public interest in space has been falling since the Apollo era.

01:19.780 --> 01:24.520
Therefore, Musk's plan with his newfound fortune was to launch a rocket to Mars carrying

01:24.520 --> 01:29.140
a small greenhouse that would grow plants on the surface of the red planet.

01:29.140 --> 01:33.300
Basically, he wanted to take all his money and put it into a big publicity stunt for

01:33.300 --> 01:37.840
space exploration, but he had a problem—it was too expensive.

01:37.840 --> 01:43.820
The cost of launches was absolutely immense and, even when Musk tried to buy decommissioned

01:43.820 --> 01:49.100
Russian ICBMs, he couldn't find a way to pull off the project, but he had discovered

01:49.100 --> 01:52.380
something—the space launch industry was ripe for disruption.

01:52.380 --> 01:56.460
Here's Joseph, the economics expert from RealLifeLore to explain why.

01:56.460 --> 02:02.220
The rocket development and space launch companies before SpaceX were essentially aggregators.

02:02.220 --> 02:06.060
They bought engines and guidance systems and all the other various components from other

02:06.060 --> 02:09.280
companies to cobble together one completed rocket.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.240
But all the different component suppliers also had their own component suppliers to

02:13.240 --> 02:14.700
make their product.

02:14.700 --> 02:19.500
The suppliers of the suppliers not only had to cover their development and manufacturing

02:19.500 --> 02:23.680
costs, they had to sell their components at a markup in order to make a profit.

02:23.680 --> 02:27.300
And then the next component manufacturer had to do the same, which means that by the time

02:27.300 --> 02:31.660
the component gets to the company that's assembling the rocket, it's expensive.

02:31.660 --> 02:36.200
Not only that, but the assembly company also has to pay for employees that work to actually

02:36.200 --> 02:39.440
figure out how to make all of the different pieces work together.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.840
SpaceX, however, works differently.

02:41.840 --> 02:47.780
It makes 85% of the components it uses itself, which allows it to make cheaper parts.

02:47.780 --> 02:52.680
For example, if SpaceX had bought their radios externally, they would be paying $50,000 to

02:52.680 --> 02:54.680
$100,000 each.

02:54.680 --> 03:00.300
But since they developed them internally, they only cost $5,000 each to build—a dramatic

03:00.300 --> 03:02.580
improvement in reducing cost.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.960
Joseph from RealLifeLore has a brand new book which includes two fantastic chapters explaining

03:06.960 --> 03:11.320
simple economic concepts like this that I'll link in the description, but let's talk

03:11.320 --> 03:12.320
Tesla.

03:12.320 --> 03:16.120
Tesla's economic strategy is fairly similar to SpaceX's.

03:16.120 --> 03:22.980
Tesla themselves makes about 80% of the 5,300 parts in a Tesla car, but for the most part

03:22.980 --> 03:26.920
it doesn't make these—the batteries, at least yet.

03:26.920 --> 03:32.060
Batteries are very difficult to make at a competitive price so very few companies do.

03:32.060 --> 03:38.720
The largest three manufacturers—Panasonic, BYD, and LG Chem—make a combined 63% of

03:38.720 --> 03:39.940
the world's batteries.

03:39.940 --> 03:44.700
Tesla, therefore, has historically just bought batteries from Panasonic at a cost of about

03:44.700 --> 03:50.580
$200 per kilowatt hour, but that means that Tesla's smallest battery pack—the 50 kilowatt

03:50.580 --> 03:55.400
hour version—costs $10,000 just in components.

03:55.400 --> 04:00.620
When you're trying to sell a $35,000 car and make a profit, that's a significant

04:00.620 --> 04:02.660
cost that can be reduced.

04:02.660 --> 04:07.680
Therefore, Tesla is attempting to reduce the cost of their batteries by 30% by building

04:07.680 --> 04:11.100
their own factory in a joint venture with Panasonic.

04:11.100 --> 04:16.220
Their long-term goal, however, is to drop the battery price below $100 per kilowatt

04:16.220 --> 04:21.180
hour which would either double the range or halve the price of that 50 kilowatt hour battery

04:21.180 --> 04:22.180
pack.

04:22.180 --> 04:26.340
But the vertical integration of Tesla and SpaceX isn't all useful.

04:26.340 --> 04:31.460
The companies basically have to learn and perfect each step in the manufacturing process

04:31.460 --> 04:35.600
and, if one step isn't working, no cars get made.

04:35.600 --> 04:41.400
For example, the Tesla Model 3, the low-cost Tesla, is built using steel instead of aluminum

04:41.400 --> 04:43.220
like the Model S and X.

04:43.220 --> 04:47.820
With this change, the manufacturer is having troubles properly welding the vehicle bodies

04:47.820 --> 04:52.760
together and so the entire production line is slowed down massively.

04:52.760 --> 04:57.020
But there's something else unique about SpaceX and Tesla's production lines—they're

04:57.020 --> 04:58.020
in the US.

04:58.020 --> 05:00.200
Now this probably seems counter-intuitive.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.240
Why would you put the production lines of two companies working to make the least expensive

05:04.240 --> 05:08.640
products on the market in one of the most expensive labor markets in the world?

05:08.640 --> 05:13.480
Almost every US company has relocated their production lines to cheaper labor markets

05:13.480 --> 05:18.240
in Asia and Africa but Musk has always had his in the US.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.040
Believe it or not, this isn't a PR move.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.920
It actually makes sense for the two companies.

05:23.920 --> 05:28.540
Tesla and SpaceX's production processes are constantly being tweaked and optimized

05:28.540 --> 05:31.220
as the companies learn to make their products.

05:31.220 --> 05:36.480
While China might be able to build Tesla cars at the same price by using cheaper human labor,

05:36.480 --> 05:41.660
Tesla's US factory is just miles away from its headquarters in Palo Alto meaning that

05:41.660 --> 05:47.080
the executive, development, and production staff are all heavily integrated and can make

05:47.080 --> 05:48.840
changes fast.

05:48.840 --> 05:54.120
SpaceX even takes this a step further—its offices and manufacturing lines are all under

05:54.120 --> 05:55.160
one roof.

05:55.160 --> 06:00.540
The Tesla factory in particular is also heavily automatized and the US excels in production

06:00.540 --> 06:03.980
line automation with its abundance of highly sealed workers.

06:03.980 --> 06:07.460
But just how much is Musk dropping the price on his products?

06:07.460 --> 06:11.880
The United Launch Alliance, which historically has won most of the highly lucrative US government

06:11.880 --> 06:17.700
launch contracts, is believed to charge more than $400 million dollars all in for a military

06:17.700 --> 06:21.840
satellite launch while SpaceX charges about $80 million dollars.

06:21.840 --> 06:27.260
So SpaceX is already at a fifth of the price but, as mentioned, Elon Musk wants that to

06:27.260 --> 06:28.520
fall to a tenth.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.160
Here's the key for that.

06:30.160 --> 06:35.600
The fuel used in the Falcon 9 rocket only costs about $200,000 per launch.

06:35.600 --> 06:38.560
It's practically a non-factor in the launch price.

06:38.560 --> 06:44.000
The real cost is of the rockets themselves so that's why SpaceX is making them reusable.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.200
The first stage of the rocket is now being designed to land back on earth and be put

06:48.200 --> 06:51.400
back into service with dozens of more launches.

06:51.400 --> 06:55.480
Once this system becomes reliable, it's believed that the cost savings will drop the

06:55.480 --> 07:00.760
launch price to $40 million dollars—a full ten times cheaper than the United Launch Alliance's

07:00.760 --> 07:02.200
military launch price.

07:02.200 --> 07:07.440
SpaceX's long-term goal is to get the launch price down to about $10 million dollars per

07:07.440 --> 07:08.440
launch.

07:08.440 --> 07:12.920
While this has already made a significant impact on the space industry, a launch price

07:12.920 --> 07:17.320
as low as this would fundamentally change what's possible in space.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.260
Real space tourism would become feasible, commercial satellites would become downright

07:21.260 --> 07:25.280
commonplace, and space would become closer than it's ever been.

07:25.280 --> 07:28.000
But SpaceX does have a bit of a problem.

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
People aren't really buying more rocket launches even though prices are down.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.080
It's what's known as a price inelastic market.

07:35.120 --> 07:40.000
That's the opposite of Tesla and the electric vehicle market where lower prices lead to

07:40.000 --> 07:42.400
huge increases in sales.

07:42.400 --> 07:46.480
The problem with the space launch market is that it is not a consumer market.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.960
Normal people don't buy rocket launches.

07:48.960 --> 07:53.320
Governments buy rocket launches and they don't care about price nearly as much as people

07:53.320 --> 07:55.520
since it's not the decision maker's money.

07:55.520 --> 08:00.040
The US Air Force, for example, decides they need to launch a certain number of satellites

08:00.040 --> 08:04.640
each year for national security reasons and they'll pay whatever it takes.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.240
But Elon Musk's life goal is to get humanity to Mars.

08:08.240 --> 08:12.280
That's why SpaceX exists and he needs money to do it.

08:12.280 --> 08:13.280
Lots of money.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.560
So, SpaceX is getting into the internet business.

08:16.560 --> 08:21.120
The company is actively developing a satellite constellation that would provide high-speed

08:21.120 --> 08:23.160
internet to anywhere on earth.

08:23.160 --> 08:28.280
Thousands of small satellites would be put into low earth orbit and then anyone worldwide

08:28.280 --> 08:32.020
could hook into the network using an inexpensive ground receiver.

08:32.020 --> 08:38.180
If SpaceX got just 50 million users out of the 7 billion in its proposed service area,

08:38.180 --> 08:41.960
this business could bring in $30 billion a year.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.100
Since SpaceX would be building and launching the satellites themselves, costs would be

08:46.100 --> 08:49.060
dramatically lower than the competitions.

08:49.060 --> 08:55.660
The whole commercial aspect of SpaceX essentially exists to fund Musk's future space exploration

08:55.660 --> 08:56.780
projects.

08:56.780 --> 09:00.580
For that reason, SpaceX is not a public company like Tesla.

09:00.620 --> 09:04.020
Elon Musk does not want to make money with SpaceX.

09:04.020 --> 09:05.700
He wants to get to Mars.

09:05.700 --> 09:09.580
He does not want to be beholden to shareholders and profitability.

09:09.580 --> 09:14.460
Musk has therefore publicly said that SpaceX will not go public until the company achieves

09:14.460 --> 09:19.180
regular flights to and from Mars and thanks to the entrepreneur's understanding of basic

09:19.180 --> 09:23.180
economics, that might not be too far off.

09:23.180 --> 09:27.860
If you're looking to start a company, you'll need not only an understanding of basic economics

09:27.860 --> 09:29.780
but also a domain.
