Imagine a $2,000 car, or a $100 laptop, or a $70 iPhone, or imagine any product ten times

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,160
cheaper than it was.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,360
Imagine the fundamental market change that would bring.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,460
Imagine the amount of demand there would be for that $2,000 car, or a $100 laptop,

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,800
or a $70 iPhone.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,880
That's what Elon Musk imagined 15 years ago when he sat on a pile of $165 million.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,660
Elon Musk's businesses are all centered around some of the most basic principles of

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,360
economics out there.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,620
When he starts a business, he's not necessarily trying to do something new, he's trying

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,320
to do something right.

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,980
Musk made most of his early fortune through his involvement with PayPal.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:59,060
In 1999 he founded a company called x.com which was quickly bought by Confinity, the

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,620
creators of PayPal, so when PayPal was bought by eBay in 2002, Musk's 11.7% ownership

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,180
of the company translated to $165 million.

17
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:16,060
Elon Musk has always been deeply passionate about space exploration and, as anyone knows,

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,780
public interest in space has been falling since the Apollo era.

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,520
Therefore, Musk's plan with his newfound fortune was to launch a rocket to Mars carrying

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,140
a small greenhouse that would grow plants on the surface of the red planet.

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,300
Basically, he wanted to take all his money and put it into a big publicity stunt for

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,840
space exploration, but he had a problem—it was too expensive.

23
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,820
The cost of launches was absolutely immense and, even when Musk tried to buy decommissioned

24
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,100
Russian ICBMs, he couldn't find a way to pull off the project, but he had discovered

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,380
something—the space launch industry was ripe for disruption.

26
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,460
Here's Joseph, the economics expert from RealLifeLore to explain why.

27
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:02,220
The rocket development and space launch companies before SpaceX were essentially aggregators.

28
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,060
They bought engines and guidance systems and all the other various components from other

29
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,280
companies to cobble together one completed rocket.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,240
But all the different component suppliers also had their own component suppliers to

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,700
make their product.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,500
The suppliers of the suppliers not only had to cover their development and manufacturing

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,680
costs, they had to sell their components at a markup in order to make a profit.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,300
And then the next component manufacturer had to do the same, which means that by the time

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,660
the component gets to the company that's assembling the rocket, it's expensive.

36
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,200
Not only that, but the assembly company also has to pay for employees that work to actually

37
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,440
figure out how to make all of the different pieces work together.

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,840
SpaceX, however, works differently.

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,780
It makes 85% of the components it uses itself, which allows it to make cheaper parts.

40
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,680
For example, if SpaceX had bought their radios externally, they would be paying $50,000 to

41
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
$100,000 each.

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,300
But since they developed them internally, they only cost $5,000 each to build—a dramatic

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,580
improvement in reducing cost.

44
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,960
Joseph from RealLifeLore has a brand new book which includes two fantastic chapters explaining

45
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,320
simple economic concepts like this that I'll link in the description, but let's talk

46
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
Tesla.

47
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,120
Tesla's economic strategy is fairly similar to SpaceX's.

48
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,980
Tesla themselves makes about 80% of the 5,300 parts in a Tesla car, but for the most part

49
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,920
it doesn't make these—the batteries, at least yet.

50
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,060
Batteries are very difficult to make at a competitive price so very few companies do.

51
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,720
The largest three manufacturers—Panasonic, BYD, and LG Chem—make a combined 63% of

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,940
the world's batteries.

53
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,700
Tesla, therefore, has historically just bought batteries from Panasonic at a cost of about

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:50,580
$200 per kilowatt hour, but that means that Tesla's smallest battery pack—the 50 kilowatt

55
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,400
hour version—costs $10,000 just in components.

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,620
When you're trying to sell a $35,000 car and make a profit, that's a significant

57
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,660
cost that can be reduced.

58
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,680
Therefore, Tesla is attempting to reduce the cost of their batteries by 30% by building

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,100
their own factory in a joint venture with Panasonic.

60
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,220
Their long-term goal, however, is to drop the battery price below $100 per kilowatt

61
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,180
hour which would either double the range or halve the price of that 50 kilowatt hour battery

62
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,180
pack.

63
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,340
But the vertical integration of Tesla and SpaceX isn't all useful.

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,460
The companies basically have to learn and perfect each step in the manufacturing process

65
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:35,600
and, if one step isn't working, no cars get made.

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,400
For example, the Tesla Model 3, the low-cost Tesla, is built using steel instead of aluminum

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,220
like the Model S and X.

68
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,820
With this change, the manufacturer is having troubles properly welding the vehicle bodies

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,760
together and so the entire production line is slowed down massively.

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,020
But there's something else unique about SpaceX and Tesla's production lines—they're

71
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
in the US.

72
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,200
Now this probably seems counter-intuitive.

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,240
Why would you put the production lines of two companies working to make the least expensive

74
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,640
products on the market in one of the most expensive labor markets in the world?

75
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,480
Almost every US company has relocated their production lines to cheaper labor markets

76
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,240
in Asia and Africa but Musk has always had his in the US.

77
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,040
Believe it or not, this isn't a PR move.

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,920
It actually makes sense for the two companies.

79
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,540
Tesla and SpaceX's production processes are constantly being tweaked and optimized

80
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,220
as the companies learn to make their products.

81
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,480
While China might be able to build Tesla cars at the same price by using cheaper human labor,

82
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,660
Tesla's US factory is just miles away from its headquarters in Palo Alto meaning that

83
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,080
the executive, development, and production staff are all heavily integrated and can make

84
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,840
changes fast.

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:54,120
SpaceX even takes this a step further—its offices and manufacturing lines are all under

86
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,160
one roof.

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,540
The Tesla factory in particular is also heavily automatized and the US excels in production

88
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,980
line automation with its abundance of highly sealed workers.

89
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,460
But just how much is Musk dropping the price on his products?

90
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,880
The United Launch Alliance, which historically has won most of the highly lucrative US government

91
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,700
launch contracts, is believed to charge more than $400 million dollars all in for a military

92
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,840
satellite launch while SpaceX charges about $80 million dollars.

93
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,260
So SpaceX is already at a fifth of the price but, as mentioned, Elon Musk wants that to

94
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,520
fall to a tenth.

95
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,160
Here's the key for that.

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,600
The fuel used in the Falcon 9 rocket only costs about $200,000 per launch.

97
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,560
It's practically a non-factor in the launch price.

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,000
The real cost is of the rockets themselves so that's why SpaceX is making them reusable.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,200
The first stage of the rocket is now being designed to land back on earth and be put

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
back into service with dozens of more launches.

101
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,480
Once this system becomes reliable, it's believed that the cost savings will drop the

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,760
launch price to $40 million dollars—a full ten times cheaper than the United Launch Alliance's

103
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,200
military launch price.

104
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,440
SpaceX's long-term goal is to get the launch price down to about $10 million dollars per

105
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
launch.

106
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,920
While this has already made a significant impact on the space industry, a launch price

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,320
as low as this would fundamentally change what's possible in space.

108
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,260
Real space tourism would become feasible, commercial satellites would become downright

109
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,280
commonplace, and space would become closer than it's ever been.

110
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,000
But SpaceX does have a bit of a problem.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
People aren't really buying more rocket launches even though prices are down.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,080
It's what's known as a price inelastic market.

113
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,000
That's the opposite of Tesla and the electric vehicle market where lower prices lead to

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
huge increases in sales.

115
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,480
The problem with the space launch market is that it is not a consumer market.

116
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,960
Normal people don't buy rocket launches.

117
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,320
Governments buy rocket launches and they don't care about price nearly as much as people

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,520
since it's not the decision maker's money.

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,040
The US Air Force, for example, decides they need to launch a certain number of satellites

120
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,640
each year for national security reasons and they'll pay whatever it takes.

121
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,240
But Elon Musk's life goal is to get humanity to Mars.

122
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,280
That's why SpaceX exists and he needs money to do it.

123
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Lots of money.

124
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,560
So, SpaceX is getting into the internet business.

125
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
The company is actively developing a satellite constellation that would provide high-speed

126
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,160
internet to anywhere on earth.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,280
Thousands of small satellites would be put into low earth orbit and then anyone worldwide

128
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,020
could hook into the network using an inexpensive ground receiver.

129
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:38,180
If SpaceX got just 50 million users out of the 7 billion in its proposed service area,

130
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,960
this business could bring in $30 billion a year.

131
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,100
Since SpaceX would be building and launching the satellites themselves, costs would be

132
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,060
dramatically lower than the competitions.

133
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:55,660
The whole commercial aspect of SpaceX essentially exists to fund Musk's future space exploration

134
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,780
projects.

135
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:00,580
For that reason, SpaceX is not a public company like Tesla.

136
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,020
Elon Musk does not want to make money with SpaceX.

137
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,700
He wants to get to Mars.

138
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,580
He does not want to be beholden to shareholders and profitability.

139
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,460
Musk has therefore publicly said that SpaceX will not go public until the company achieves

140
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,180
regular flights to and from Mars and thanks to the entrepreneur's understanding of basic

141
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,180
economics, that might not be too far off.

142
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,860
If you're looking to start a company, you'll need not only an understanding of basic economics

143
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,780
but also a domain.

144
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,260

145
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,380
They have over 400 domain extensions that let you create unique domains like mine—Wendover.productions.

146
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,640
It literally takes minutes to find and buy your domain but if you do ever have an issue
