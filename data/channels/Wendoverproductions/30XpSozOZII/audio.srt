4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,520
If you look up, there are 4,708 satellites that came from earth currently orbiting our

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,520
planet.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,140
Just in the portion of the sky you can see, hundreds of satellites are passing overhead

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,780
at any given time.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,540
You often can't see them, but they're there making GPS work, taking images of earth,

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,540
scanning communications, even spying for governments.

10
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,620
These satellites are some of the most expensive single objects that can be made.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,980
If you took a tennis ball sized chunk of the Hubble Space Telescope, it would be worth

12
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,540
over $1,500.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,020
Modern full-scale commercial-grade satellites cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

14
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,580
They're just incredibly complex objects that require years to construct.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,880
Many of the satellites flying over you right now, though, started their life here, at SSL

16
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,720
in Palo Alto, California.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,880
SSL is a commercial company owned by Maxar Technology specializing in satellite and spacecraft

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,880
construction.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,840
They've built spacecraft that are currently in orbit for everyone from DirecTV to national

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
governments.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,560
If you've ever watched satellite TV, listened to satellite radio, or used satellite internet

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,480
on a plane, there's a decent chance you've directly used one of the satellites they built

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,920
here in their factory.

24
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,320
But let's say you want to buy a satellite from SSL.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
What do you do?

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,640
The first thing you do is pick up the phone and call us, but the next thing you should

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,560
do is check your bank account to make sure you have enough money to buy a satellite.

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,520
Satellites, depending on what kind it is and where it's going, can cost tens of millions

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,320
of dollars up to several hundred million dollars.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,440
Once a customer makes that first phone call to SSL, there will be then an ongoing back

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,800
and forth between them and the customer.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,920
Essentially, the customer will tell SSL what they want their satellite to do and SSL will

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,720
come back to them with a price.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,480
Eventually, if all goes well, they'll sign a contract.

35
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,280
That's exactly what happened a few years ago between SSL and Telesat—a global satellite

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,400
company headquartered in Canada that owns and operates a fleet of satellites.

37
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,440
Their satellites are used to broadcast signals, whether it be TV, radio, or internet, for

38
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,360
their customers—satellite TV, radio, and internet providers.

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,500
In this case, Telesat needed a satellite to provide additional capacity over the busy

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,720
North Atlantic region and so they came and signed a contract with SSL to build their

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,660
new satellite—Telstar 19 Vantage.

42
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,160
Soon after contracts were signed, work began on designing the satellite.

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,020
In that process, the designers usually pull designs for some more generic aspects from

44
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,580
previous projects and then modify them to suit the particular job.

45
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,540
The length of that process can vary widely based off of how complex a satellite is but

46
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,660
throughout that process, as soon as they've locked a design in, they'll begin ordering

47
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
parts.

48
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:48,380
SSL builds about half their components themselves and orders the other half from other companies.

49
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,460
The decision on whether to order or build in-house usually comes down to performance.

50
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,980
There are certain components where, depending on what the requirements are, we build higher

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,280
performance components than suppliers.

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,840
Some of them are suppliers build better components than we do.

53
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,420
Over the years, SSL has looked at what it's good at and what other suppliers are good

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,700
at and made the decision on what to order based off that.

55
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,680
For example, one of the components that SSL builds are the antenna reflectors.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,440
These are what actually direct signals down to earth and each of them is custom designed

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,140
for the region that the satellite will cover.

58
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,300
This is, for example, for Telstar 18 Vantage.

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,940
You can see here that these are these reflectors that would be sticking out on the sides and

60
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,060
it's used for sending signals back to earth and all those little dots you see on there

61
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:40,700
are for photogrammetry so they're used to make sure that the surface is actually

62
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:46,860
exactly as was designed so we have these cameras that take pictures of these and of all the

63
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,660
dots to make sure that it was built according to the design.

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,260
The satellite these antenna reflectors eventually went on, Telstar 18 Vantage, the sister satellite

65
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,220
of Telstar 19 Vantage, will launch in late August 2018 and soon after will go into service

66
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,740
providing data services over Asia and Oceania so the antenna reflector was carefully crafted

67
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:11,100
to provide signal over populated areas and busy flight and maritime corridors while not

68
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,940
wasting resources on providing service to areas the company already has coverage for

69
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,260
or that would have little demand such as to the south of Australia.

70
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,300
About 9 to 15 months after ordering, the majority of the ordered components will start rolling

71
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,580
through the door and then the bulk of the assembly process begins.

72
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,280
This process is too complex to go into detail on but essentially they'll first build the

73
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,980
major elements separately.

74
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,460
One group will assemble the propulsion systems and framework of the satellite while another

75
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,720
will assemble the payload, which the satellite is actually built to carry whether that be

76
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,460
an advanced camera or a communications system, while yet another group will assemble the

77
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,480
super-light and efficient solar panels that will power the satellite when in orbit.

78
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,220
The assembly of the different major components will take a few more months and then they'll

79
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,640
start to compile those different major components together over a period of a few more months.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,580
Each component is tested independently before and while being installed on the satellite

81
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,260
but once they're all pieced together there begins an incredibly rigorous phase of testing

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,940
the satellite as a whole.

83
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,020
When buying a satellite from a trusted manufacturer like SSL, the customer is buying reliability

84
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,580
so there can be no compromise on testing.

85
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,380
They need to be sure that the satellite will actually survive launch and work in space

86
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,140
and the best way to do that is to just simulate launch and space.

87
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,460
There are three major factors that could harm a satellite—vibration, temperature, and

88
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
sound.

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,220
The vibration comes as a satellite launches in a rocket so they test that their satellites

90
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,460
can survive launch.

91
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,340
When you put one of these satellites on top of a rocket in the payload fairing it experienced

92
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:38,540
a lot of vibration loads in the X, Y, and Z so we're able to simulate all of those

93
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,060
with this shaker table.

94
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,580
It has a base plate there and you can shake in this direction, in this direction, or in

95
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,100
this direction so it does in all different directions to simulate the environment and

96
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
make sure that it's all operating.

97
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,680
The satellite on the table in testing here is Telstar 19 Vantage itself.

98
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,640
This here is just one of the many tests where they literally just shake the satellites and

99
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,080
see how it responds.

100
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,880
They only last about 60 to 90 seconds each because that's how long the satellite will

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,600
experience vibration during launch until the rocket reaches the upper atmosphere.

102
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
They'll also be sure that their satellites can survive the vacuum and temperatures of

103
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
space.

104
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,720
What you see up there, this big blue pumpkin looking thing like Cinderella's carriage,

105
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,360
that one is called our thermal vacuum chamber.

106
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,880
We like to call it the blue pumpkin.

107
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,600
What we use it for is for simulating the thermal vacuum environment of space.

108
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,580
We'll go down to the vacuum levels of space, 10 to the minus 5 torr, and we will turn on

109
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,900
the payload and different parts of the satellite to make sure that everything's functioning

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,160
properly when you put it in space.

111
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,200
In addition to that, once it's under vacuum, we have these thermal panels in there to simulate

112
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,800
the hot and cold environment.

113
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,320
When you're facing the sun and the satellite gets really hot, we bring those temperatures

114
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,020
to bear and then we make it really cold when it's facing away from earth in an eclipse

115
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,240
type of situation and make sure that everything's functioning properly.

116
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,920
Lastly, launch is very loud to the point that the acoustic energy could actually damage

117
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,520
a satellite so they make sure it doesn't by simulating the launch environment through

118
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,760
bombarding the satellite with acoustic energy with speakers.

119
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,640
There are a myriad of other tests performed before the satellite is given SSL stamp of

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,920
approval but once it's ready the satellite does, of course, need to get to the launch

121
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
site.

122
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,680
The customer decides which launch provider to use whether it be SpaceX, United Launch

123
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,360
Alliance, Arianespace, or another so the satellite might only need to go as far as Vandenberg

124
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,640
Air Force Base a four hour drive away or as far as Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

125
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,260
The launch site is also partially decided based off what sort of orbit this satellite

126
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,440
is going into.

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,520
If a satellite is going to orbit in a north-south direction over the poles they want to launch

128
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,100
in that direction so they want to launch from a site with open water to the north or

129
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,000
south both for safety and, for some rocket designs, so sages of rockets can fall into

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
the ocean throughout the launch process.

131
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,480
SpaceX, for example, therefore uses Vandenberg Air Force Base in California for their polar

132
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,720
orbit launches as it has the Pacific Ocean directly south.

133
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,320
For geosynchronous orbits where satellites travel from west to east at the same rate

134
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,760
as earth rotates, they want to launch in the same direction as the satellites will orbit.

135
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,640
For that reason they can't launch from Vandenberg as it has land to the east so SpaceX

136
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,940
uses the launch pads on Cape Canaveral, Florida as they have the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

137
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,760
In the case of Telstar 19 Vantage it was going in geosynchronous orbit in order to stay consistently

138
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,880
over its service area so SSL needed to get the satellites all the way across the country

139
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,880
to Florida.

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,400
No matter where a satellite is going, it gets packed up into one of these specialized shipping

141
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
containers.

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,320
For travel to closer launch sites within the US they'll often drive.

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,080
They'll put the container on a truck driven by trusted oversized vehicle drivers, have

144
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,760
a lead vehicle checking for obstructions, a trailing vehicle watching to make sure nothing

145
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,840
goes wrong, and for longer drives a motor home so drivers can swap out and rest while

146
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,960
still moving.

147
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,240
If the launch site is far, such as the ones overseas in French Guiana, in Kazakhstan,

148
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,580
or even the further ones in the US such as Cape Canaveral, they'll fly the satellite

149
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,200
over in an Antonov cargo plane.

150
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,600
Satellites arrive to their launch site at least a month before their launch as there's

151
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,700
plenty of last minute preparation to do.

152
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,660
They have to perform additional testing to make sure nothing was damaged in transport,

153
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,840
fuel it up, and mount it in the rocket.

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,580
Once that happens, though, there's a period where there's really nothing for SSL to

155
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,580
do.

156
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,220
As they go through the process of the countdown there are a number of places where we're

157
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,500
asked to confirm that we're ready for launch.

158
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,020
Then they launch us and at that point we can no longer monitor our satellite until we're

159
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,520
off the launch vehicle.

160
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,920
So for about a half hour we're hoping that the launch vehicle guys are doing everything

161
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,240
okay and they usually are.

162
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,600
In the case of Telstar 19 Vantage, the customer entrusted SpaceX with the responsibility of

163
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,920
getting their satellite to orbit so on July 22nd, 2018, at 1.50am, a Falcon 9 rocket lifted

164
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,900
off from Cape Canaveral carrying SSL's latest creation to space.

165
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,640
The launch of this satellite actually made the record books as it is the heaviest commercial

166
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,200
communications satellite to ever be entered into service at 15,600 pounds.

167
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
On that early morning in July, the Falcon 9 gained altitude as it flew southeast over

168
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,480
Africa then 32 minutes and 40 seconds after launching, 358 miles above Mozambique, Telstar

169
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,900
19 Vantage was released from the rocket and gently pushed forward in the first moments

170
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,760
of its 15 year long orbit of earth.

171
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,560
At that point, the work's not done for SSL though.

172
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,940
Their job is not just to build the satellite but also to enter it into service in space.

173
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,780
Once the satellite is deployed, SSL will look for its signal and establish communications.

174
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,440
And then we start talking to the satellite so we start commanding the satellite, we tell

175
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,500
the satellite what we want it to do, we start to get the satellite into a safe position

176
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,920
after launch, we'll deploy solar rays so we can start generating power, we'll start

177
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,440
to activate everything on the satellite, and then we'll put the satellite in a safe

178
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
condition so that the crew can get some rest.

179
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,720
Over the next ten days there's a process of firing the satellite's engines to raise

180
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,600
it from the altitude of 350 miles where it's deployed to 22,000 miles where it will stay

181
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
for its service life.

182
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,420
There's then another two to four weeks of testing to make sure everything survived launch

183
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,400
and then, finally, after years of work, it's time to hand over the satellite to Telesat,

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,500
the customer, so they can put it online and start operating it commercially.

185
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:23,760
At that point, after years of work, the satellite can finally itself be put to work.

186
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,960
One of the aspects of how satellites work that I found most interesting to learn about

187
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,780
when I filmed this video was on how orbits work.

188
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,000
The science of how you can make an object orbit at such a consistent speed that it will

189
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,340
stay over one particular area of earth is fascinating and if you want to learn all about

190
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,820
how that works, Brilliant teaches you exactly that in their classical mechanics course.

191
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,700
Of course, there's more than just orbits.

192
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,720
This course provides a great overview of physics and with Brilliant, you'll actually understand

193
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
the concepts rather than just learning them.

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,800
They specialize in teaching the intuitive principles behind concepts so that you can

195
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,360
learn the why.

196
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,500
They also have plenty of other fascinating courses on topics like astronomy, logic, and

197
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,340
gravitational physics—a course that teaches how planetary orbits work.

198
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,460
All in all, Brilliant is a great place to learn and best of all, you can try Brilliant's
