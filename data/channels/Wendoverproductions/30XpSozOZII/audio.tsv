9940	16520	If you look up, there are 4,708 satellites that came from earth currently orbiting our
16520	17520	planet.
17520	21140	Just in the portion of the sky you can see, hundreds of satellites are passing overhead
21140	22780	at any given time.
22780	27540	You often can't see them, but they're there making GPS work, taking images of earth,
27540	30540	scanning communications, even spying for governments.
30540	34620	These satellites are some of the most expensive single objects that can be made.
34620	38980	If you took a tennis ball sized chunk of the Hubble Space Telescope, it would be worth
38980	41540	over $1,500.
41540	46020	Modern full-scale commercial-grade satellites cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
46020	50580	They're just incredibly complex objects that require years to construct.
50580	55880	Many of the satellites flying over you right now, though, started their life here, at SSL
55880	57720	in Palo Alto, California.
57720	62880	SSL is a commercial company owned by Maxar Technology specializing in satellite and spacecraft
62880	63880	construction.
63880	67840	They've built spacecraft that are currently in orbit for everyone from DirecTV to national
67840	68840	governments.
68840	72560	If you've ever watched satellite TV, listened to satellite radio, or used satellite internet
72560	76480	on a plane, there's a decent chance you've directly used one of the satellites they built
76480	77920	here in their factory.
77920	81320	But let's say you want to buy a satellite from SSL.
81320	82320	What do you do?
82320	85640	The first thing you do is pick up the phone and call us, but the next thing you should
85640	90560	do is check your bank account to make sure you have enough money to buy a satellite.
90560	97520	Satellites, depending on what kind it is and where it's going, can cost tens of millions
97520	100320	of dollars up to several hundred million dollars.
100320	104440	Once a customer makes that first phone call to SSL, there will be then an ongoing back
104440	106800	and forth between them and the customer.
106800	110920	Essentially, the customer will tell SSL what they want their satellite to do and SSL will
110920	112720	come back to them with a price.
112720	115480	Eventually, if all goes well, they'll sign a contract.
115480	120280	That's exactly what happened a few years ago between SSL and Telesat—a global satellite
120280	124400	company headquartered in Canada that owns and operates a fleet of satellites.
124400	128440	Their satellites are used to broadcast signals, whether it be TV, radio, or internet, for
128440	132360	their customers—satellite TV, radio, and internet providers.
132360	136500	In this case, Telesat needed a satellite to provide additional capacity over the busy
136500	140720	North Atlantic region and so they came and signed a contract with SSL to build their
140720	143660	new satellite—Telstar 19 Vantage.
143660	147160	Soon after contracts were signed, work began on designing the satellite.
147160	151020	In that process, the designers usually pull designs for some more generic aspects from
151020	154580	previous projects and then modify them to suit the particular job.
154580	158540	The length of that process can vary widely based off of how complex a satellite is but
158540	162660	throughout that process, as soon as they've locked a design in, they'll begin ordering
162660	163660	parts.
163660	168380	SSL builds about half their components themselves and orders the other half from other companies.
168380	172460	The decision on whether to order or build in-house usually comes down to performance.
172460	177980	There are certain components where, depending on what the requirements are, we build higher
177980	180280	performance components than suppliers.
180280	183840	Some of them are suppliers build better components than we do.
183840	187420	Over the years, SSL has looked at what it's good at and what other suppliers are good
187420	190700	at and made the decision on what to order based off that.
190740	194680	For example, one of the components that SSL builds are the antenna reflectors.
194680	198440	These are what actually direct signals down to earth and each of them is custom designed
198440	200140	for the region that the satellite will cover.
200140	203300	This is, for example, for Telstar 18 Vantage.
203300	208940	You can see here that these are these reflectors that would be sticking out on the sides and
208940	214060	it's used for sending signals back to earth and all those little dots you see on there
214060	220700	are for photogrammetry so they're used to make sure that the surface is actually
220700	226860	exactly as was designed so we have these cameras that take pictures of these and of all the
226860	232660	dots to make sure that it was built according to the design.
232660	237260	The satellite these antenna reflectors eventually went on, Telstar 18 Vantage, the sister satellite
237260	242220	of Telstar 19 Vantage, will launch in late August 2018 and soon after will go into service
242220	246740	providing data services over Asia and Oceania so the antenna reflector was carefully crafted
246740	251100	to provide signal over populated areas and busy flight and maritime corridors while not
251100	254940	wasting resources on providing service to areas the company already has coverage for
254940	258260	or that would have little demand such as to the south of Australia.
258260	262300	About 9 to 15 months after ordering, the majority of the ordered components will start rolling
262300	265580	through the door and then the bulk of the assembly process begins.
265580	269280	This process is too complex to go into detail on but essentially they'll first build the
269280	270980	major elements separately.
270980	274460	One group will assemble the propulsion systems and framework of the satellite while another
274460	277720	will assemble the payload, which the satellite is actually built to carry whether that be
277720	281460	an advanced camera or a communications system, while yet another group will assemble the
281460	285480	super-light and efficient solar panels that will power the satellite when in orbit.
285480	289220	The assembly of the different major components will take a few more months and then they'll
289220	293640	start to compile those different major components together over a period of a few more months.
293640	297580	Each component is tested independently before and while being installed on the satellite
297580	301260	but once they're all pieced together there begins an incredibly rigorous phase of testing
301260	302940	the satellite as a whole.
302940	308020	When buying a satellite from a trusted manufacturer like SSL, the customer is buying reliability
308020	310580	so there can be no compromise on testing.
310580	314380	They need to be sure that the satellite will actually survive launch and work in space
314380	318140	and the best way to do that is to just simulate launch and space.
318140	322460	There are three major factors that could harm a satellite—vibration, temperature, and
322460	323460	sound.
323460	327220	The vibration comes as a satellite launches in a rocket so they test that their satellites
327220	328460	can survive launch.
328460	333340	When you put one of these satellites on top of a rocket in the payload fairing it experienced
333340	338540	a lot of vibration loads in the X, Y, and Z so we're able to simulate all of those
338540	340060	with this shaker table.
340060	343580	It has a base plate there and you can shake in this direction, in this direction, or in
343580	348100	this direction so it does in all different directions to simulate the environment and
348100	350100	make sure that it's all operating.
350100	354680	The satellite on the table in testing here is Telstar 19 Vantage itself.
354680	358640	This here is just one of the many tests where they literally just shake the satellites and
358640	360080	see how it responds.
360080	363880	They only last about 60 to 90 seconds each because that's how long the satellite will
363880	367600	experience vibration during launch until the rocket reaches the upper atmosphere.
367600	371520	They'll also be sure that their satellites can survive the vacuum and temperatures of
371520	372520	space.
372520	377720	What you see up there, this big blue pumpkin looking thing like Cinderella's carriage,
377720	381360	that one is called our thermal vacuum chamber.
381360	383880	We like to call it the blue pumpkin.
383880	388600	What we use it for is for simulating the thermal vacuum environment of space.
388600	395580	We'll go down to the vacuum levels of space, 10 to the minus 5 torr, and we will turn on
395580	399900	the payload and different parts of the satellite to make sure that everything's functioning
399900	402160	properly when you put it in space.
402160	407200	In addition to that, once it's under vacuum, we have these thermal panels in there to simulate
407200	408800	the hot and cold environment.
408800	413320	When you're facing the sun and the satellite gets really hot, we bring those temperatures
413320	417020	to bear and then we make it really cold when it's facing away from earth in an eclipse
417020	420240	type of situation and make sure that everything's functioning properly.
420240	424920	Lastly, launch is very loud to the point that the acoustic energy could actually damage
424920	428520	a satellite so they make sure it doesn't by simulating the launch environment through
428520	431760	bombarding the satellite with acoustic energy with speakers.
431760	435640	There are a myriad of other tests performed before the satellite is given SSL stamp of
435640	439920	approval but once it's ready the satellite does, of course, need to get to the launch
439920	440920	site.
440920	444680	The customer decides which launch provider to use whether it be SpaceX, United Launch
444680	449360	Alliance, Arianespace, or another so the satellite might only need to go as far as Vandenberg
449360	454640	Air Force Base a four hour drive away or as far as Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
454640	458260	The launch site is also partially decided based off what sort of orbit this satellite
458260	459440	is going into.
459440	463520	If a satellite is going to orbit in a north-south direction over the poles they want to launch
463520	467100	in that direction so they want to launch from a site with open water to the north or
467100	472000	south both for safety and, for some rocket designs, so sages of rockets can fall into
472000	474040	the ocean throughout the launch process.
474040	478480	SpaceX, for example, therefore uses Vandenberg Air Force Base in California for their polar
478480	481720	orbit launches as it has the Pacific Ocean directly south.
481720	485320	For geosynchronous orbits where satellites travel from west to east at the same rate
485320	489760	as earth rotates, they want to launch in the same direction as the satellites will orbit.
489760	493640	For that reason they can't launch from Vandenberg as it has land to the east so SpaceX
493640	497940	uses the launch pads on Cape Canaveral, Florida as they have the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
497940	502760	In the case of Telstar 19 Vantage it was going in geosynchronous orbit in order to stay consistently
502760	506880	over its service area so SSL needed to get the satellites all the way across the country
506880	507880	to Florida.
507880	512400	No matter where a satellite is going, it gets packed up into one of these specialized shipping
512400	513400	containers.
513400	516320	For travel to closer launch sites within the US they'll often drive.
516320	520080	They'll put the container on a truck driven by trusted oversized vehicle drivers, have
520080	523760	a lead vehicle checking for obstructions, a trailing vehicle watching to make sure nothing
523760	527840	goes wrong, and for longer drives a motor home so drivers can swap out and rest while
527840	528960	still moving.
528960	533240	If the launch site is far, such as the ones overseas in French Guiana, in Kazakhstan,
533240	536580	or even the further ones in the US such as Cape Canaveral, they'll fly the satellite
536580	539200	over in an Antonov cargo plane.
539200	542600	Satellites arrive to their launch site at least a month before their launch as there's
542600	544700	plenty of last minute preparation to do.
544700	548660	They have to perform additional testing to make sure nothing was damaged in transport,
548660	550840	fuel it up, and mount it in the rocket.
550840	554580	Once that happens, though, there's a period where there's really nothing for SSL to
554580	555580	do.
555580	559220	As they go through the process of the countdown there are a number of places where we're
559220	561500	asked to confirm that we're ready for launch.
561500	568020	Then they launch us and at that point we can no longer monitor our satellite until we're
568020	569520	off the launch vehicle.
569520	574920	So for about a half hour we're hoping that the launch vehicle guys are doing everything
574920	577240	okay and they usually are.
577240	581600	In the case of Telstar 19 Vantage, the customer entrusted SpaceX with the responsibility of
581600	587920	getting their satellite to orbit so on July 22nd, 2018, at 1.50am, a Falcon 9 rocket lifted
587920	591900	off from Cape Canaveral carrying SSL's latest creation to space.
591900	595640	The launch of this satellite actually made the record books as it is the heaviest commercial
595640	601200	communications satellite to ever be entered into service at 15,600 pounds.
601200	605200	On that early morning in July, the Falcon 9 gained altitude as it flew southeast over
605200	611480	Africa then 32 minutes and 40 seconds after launching, 358 miles above Mozambique, Telstar
611480	615900	19 Vantage was released from the rocket and gently pushed forward in the first moments
615900	618760	of its 15 year long orbit of earth.
618760	621560	At that point, the work's not done for SSL though.
621560	626940	Their job is not just to build the satellite but also to enter it into service in space.
626940	631780	Once the satellite is deployed, SSL will look for its signal and establish communications.
631780	635440	And then we start talking to the satellite so we start commanding the satellite, we tell
635440	641500	the satellite what we want it to do, we start to get the satellite into a safe position
641500	646920	after launch, we'll deploy solar rays so we can start generating power, we'll start
646920	651440	to activate everything on the satellite, and then we'll put the satellite in a safe
651440	654480	condition so that the crew can get some rest.
654480	657720	Over the next ten days there's a process of firing the satellite's engines to raise
657720	662600	it from the altitude of 350 miles where it's deployed to 22,000 miles where it will stay
662600	663880	for its service life.
663880	668420	There's then another two to four weeks of testing to make sure everything survived launch
668420	673400	and then, finally, after years of work, it's time to hand over the satellite to Telesat,
673400	677500	the customer, so they can put it online and start operating it commercially.
677500	683760	At that point, after years of work, the satellite can finally itself be put to work.
683760	686960	One of the aspects of how satellites work that I found most interesting to learn about
686960	689780	when I filmed this video was on how orbits work.
689780	693000	The science of how you can make an object orbit at such a consistent speed that it will
693000	697340	stay over one particular area of earth is fascinating and if you want to learn all about
697340	701820	how that works, Brilliant teaches you exactly that in their classical mechanics course.
701820	703700	Of course, there's more than just orbits.
703700	707720	This course provides a great overview of physics and with Brilliant, you'll actually understand
707720	709960	the concepts rather than just learning them.
709960	713800	They specialize in teaching the intuitive principles behind concepts so that you can
713800	715360	learn the why.
715360	719500	They also have plenty of other fascinating courses on topics like astronomy, logic, and
719500	723340	gravitational physics—a course that teaches how planetary orbits work.
