00:09.940 --> 00:16.520
If you look up, there are 4,708 satellites that came from earth currently orbiting our

00:16.520 --> 00:17.520
planet.

00:17.520 --> 00:21.140
Just in the portion of the sky you can see, hundreds of satellites are passing overhead

00:21.140 --> 00:22.780
at any given time.

00:22.780 --> 00:27.540
You often can't see them, but they're there making GPS work, taking images of earth,

00:27.540 --> 00:30.540
scanning communications, even spying for governments.

00:30.540 --> 00:34.620
These satellites are some of the most expensive single objects that can be made.

00:34.620 --> 00:38.980
If you took a tennis ball sized chunk of the Hubble Space Telescope, it would be worth

00:38.980 --> 00:41.540
over $1,500.

00:41.540 --> 00:46.020
Modern full-scale commercial-grade satellites cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

00:46.020 --> 00:50.580
They're just incredibly complex objects that require years to construct.

00:50.580 --> 00:55.880
Many of the satellites flying over you right now, though, started their life here, at SSL

00:55.880 --> 00:57.720
in Palo Alto, California.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.880
SSL is a commercial company owned by Maxar Technology specializing in satellite and spacecraft

01:02.880 --> 01:03.880
construction.

01:03.880 --> 01:07.840
They've built spacecraft that are currently in orbit for everyone from DirecTV to national

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
governments.

01:08.840 --> 01:12.560
If you've ever watched satellite TV, listened to satellite radio, or used satellite internet

01:12.560 --> 01:16.480
on a plane, there's a decent chance you've directly used one of the satellites they built

01:16.480 --> 01:17.920
here in their factory.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.320
But let's say you want to buy a satellite from SSL.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
What do you do?

01:22.320 --> 01:25.640
The first thing you do is pick up the phone and call us, but the next thing you should

01:25.640 --> 01:30.560
do is check your bank account to make sure you have enough money to buy a satellite.

01:30.560 --> 01:37.520
Satellites, depending on what kind it is and where it's going, can cost tens of millions

01:37.520 --> 01:40.320
of dollars up to several hundred million dollars.

01:40.320 --> 01:44.440
Once a customer makes that first phone call to SSL, there will be then an ongoing back

01:44.440 --> 01:46.800
and forth between them and the customer.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.920
Essentially, the customer will tell SSL what they want their satellite to do and SSL will

01:50.920 --> 01:52.720
come back to them with a price.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.480
Eventually, if all goes well, they'll sign a contract.

01:55.480 --> 02:00.280
That's exactly what happened a few years ago between SSL and Telesat—a global satellite

02:00.280 --> 02:04.400
company headquartered in Canada that owns and operates a fleet of satellites.

02:04.400 --> 02:08.440
Their satellites are used to broadcast signals, whether it be TV, radio, or internet, for

02:08.440 --> 02:12.360
their customers—satellite TV, radio, and internet providers.

02:12.360 --> 02:16.500
In this case, Telesat needed a satellite to provide additional capacity over the busy

02:16.500 --> 02:20.720
North Atlantic region and so they came and signed a contract with SSL to build their

02:20.720 --> 02:23.660
new satellite—Telstar 19 Vantage.

02:23.660 --> 02:27.160
Soon after contracts were signed, work began on designing the satellite.

02:27.160 --> 02:31.020
In that process, the designers usually pull designs for some more generic aspects from

02:31.020 --> 02:34.580
previous projects and then modify them to suit the particular job.

02:34.580 --> 02:38.540
The length of that process can vary widely based off of how complex a satellite is but

02:38.540 --> 02:42.660
throughout that process, as soon as they've locked a design in, they'll begin ordering

02:42.660 --> 02:43.660
parts.

02:43.660 --> 02:48.380
SSL builds about half their components themselves and orders the other half from other companies.

02:48.380 --> 02:52.460
The decision on whether to order or build in-house usually comes down to performance.

02:52.460 --> 02:57.980
There are certain components where, depending on what the requirements are, we build higher

02:57.980 --> 03:00.280
performance components than suppliers.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.840
Some of them are suppliers build better components than we do.

03:03.840 --> 03:07.420
Over the years, SSL has looked at what it's good at and what other suppliers are good

03:07.420 --> 03:10.700
at and made the decision on what to order based off that.

03:10.740 --> 03:14.680
For example, one of the components that SSL builds are the antenna reflectors.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.440
These are what actually direct signals down to earth and each of them is custom designed

03:18.440 --> 03:20.140
for the region that the satellite will cover.

03:20.140 --> 03:23.300
This is, for example, for Telstar 18 Vantage.

03:23.300 --> 03:28.940
You can see here that these are these reflectors that would be sticking out on the sides and

03:28.940 --> 03:34.060
it's used for sending signals back to earth and all those little dots you see on there

03:34.060 --> 03:40.700
are for photogrammetry so they're used to make sure that the surface is actually

03:40.700 --> 03:46.860
exactly as was designed so we have these cameras that take pictures of these and of all the

03:46.860 --> 03:52.660
dots to make sure that it was built according to the design.

03:52.660 --> 03:57.260
The satellite these antenna reflectors eventually went on, Telstar 18 Vantage, the sister satellite

03:57.260 --> 04:02.220
of Telstar 19 Vantage, will launch in late August 2018 and soon after will go into service

04:02.220 --> 04:06.740
providing data services over Asia and Oceania so the antenna reflector was carefully crafted

04:06.740 --> 04:11.100
to provide signal over populated areas and busy flight and maritime corridors while not

04:11.100 --> 04:14.940
wasting resources on providing service to areas the company already has coverage for

04:14.940 --> 04:18.260
or that would have little demand such as to the south of Australia.

04:18.260 --> 04:22.300
About 9 to 15 months after ordering, the majority of the ordered components will start rolling

04:22.300 --> 04:25.580
through the door and then the bulk of the assembly process begins.

04:25.580 --> 04:29.280
This process is too complex to go into detail on but essentially they'll first build the

04:29.280 --> 04:30.980
major elements separately.

04:30.980 --> 04:34.460
One group will assemble the propulsion systems and framework of the satellite while another

04:34.460 --> 04:37.720
will assemble the payload, which the satellite is actually built to carry whether that be

04:37.720 --> 04:41.460
an advanced camera or a communications system, while yet another group will assemble the

04:41.460 --> 04:45.480
super-light and efficient solar panels that will power the satellite when in orbit.

04:45.480 --> 04:49.220
The assembly of the different major components will take a few more months and then they'll

04:49.220 --> 04:53.640
start to compile those different major components together over a period of a few more months.

04:53.640 --> 04:57.580
Each component is tested independently before and while being installed on the satellite

04:57.580 --> 05:01.260
but once they're all pieced together there begins an incredibly rigorous phase of testing

05:01.260 --> 05:02.940
the satellite as a whole.

05:02.940 --> 05:08.020
When buying a satellite from a trusted manufacturer like SSL, the customer is buying reliability

05:08.020 --> 05:10.580
so there can be no compromise on testing.

05:10.580 --> 05:14.380
They need to be sure that the satellite will actually survive launch and work in space

05:14.380 --> 05:18.140
and the best way to do that is to just simulate launch and space.

05:18.140 --> 05:22.460
There are three major factors that could harm a satellite—vibration, temperature, and

05:22.460 --> 05:23.460
sound.

05:23.460 --> 05:27.220
The vibration comes as a satellite launches in a rocket so they test that their satellites

05:27.220 --> 05:28.460
can survive launch.

05:28.460 --> 05:33.340
When you put one of these satellites on top of a rocket in the payload fairing it experienced

05:33.340 --> 05:38.540
a lot of vibration loads in the X, Y, and Z so we're able to simulate all of those

05:38.540 --> 05:40.060
with this shaker table.

05:40.060 --> 05:43.580
It has a base plate there and you can shake in this direction, in this direction, or in

05:43.580 --> 05:48.100
this direction so it does in all different directions to simulate the environment and

05:48.100 --> 05:50.100
make sure that it's all operating.

05:50.100 --> 05:54.680
The satellite on the table in testing here is Telstar 19 Vantage itself.

05:54.680 --> 05:58.640
This here is just one of the many tests where they literally just shake the satellites and

05:58.640 --> 06:00.080
see how it responds.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.880
They only last about 60 to 90 seconds each because that's how long the satellite will

06:03.880 --> 06:07.600
experience vibration during launch until the rocket reaches the upper atmosphere.

06:07.600 --> 06:11.520
They'll also be sure that their satellites can survive the vacuum and temperatures of

06:11.520 --> 06:12.520
space.

06:12.520 --> 06:17.720
What you see up there, this big blue pumpkin looking thing like Cinderella's carriage,

06:17.720 --> 06:21.360
that one is called our thermal vacuum chamber.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.880
We like to call it the blue pumpkin.

06:23.880 --> 06:28.600
What we use it for is for simulating the thermal vacuum environment of space.

06:28.600 --> 06:35.580
We'll go down to the vacuum levels of space, 10 to the minus 5 torr, and we will turn on

06:35.580 --> 06:39.900
the payload and different parts of the satellite to make sure that everything's functioning

06:39.900 --> 06:42.160
properly when you put it in space.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.200
In addition to that, once it's under vacuum, we have these thermal panels in there to simulate

06:47.200 --> 06:48.800
the hot and cold environment.

06:48.800 --> 06:53.320
When you're facing the sun and the satellite gets really hot, we bring those temperatures

06:53.320 --> 06:57.020
to bear and then we make it really cold when it's facing away from earth in an eclipse

06:57.020 --> 07:00.240
type of situation and make sure that everything's functioning properly.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.920
Lastly, launch is very loud to the point that the acoustic energy could actually damage

07:04.920 --> 07:08.520
a satellite so they make sure it doesn't by simulating the launch environment through

07:08.520 --> 07:11.760
bombarding the satellite with acoustic energy with speakers.

07:11.760 --> 07:15.640
There are a myriad of other tests performed before the satellite is given SSL stamp of

07:15.640 --> 07:19.920
approval but once it's ready the satellite does, of course, need to get to the launch

07:19.920 --> 07:20.920
site.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.680
The customer decides which launch provider to use whether it be SpaceX, United Launch

07:24.680 --> 07:29.360
Alliance, Arianespace, or another so the satellite might only need to go as far as Vandenberg

07:29.360 --> 07:34.640
Air Force Base a four hour drive away or as far as Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.260
The launch site is also partially decided based off what sort of orbit this satellite

07:38.260 --> 07:39.440
is going into.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.520
If a satellite is going to orbit in a north-south direction over the poles they want to launch

07:43.520 --> 07:47.100
in that direction so they want to launch from a site with open water to the north or

07:47.100 --> 07:52.000
south both for safety and, for some rocket designs, so sages of rockets can fall into

07:52.000 --> 07:54.040
the ocean throughout the launch process.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.480
SpaceX, for example, therefore uses Vandenberg Air Force Base in California for their polar

07:58.480 --> 08:01.720
orbit launches as it has the Pacific Ocean directly south.

08:01.720 --> 08:05.320
For geosynchronous orbits where satellites travel from west to east at the same rate

08:05.320 --> 08:09.760
as earth rotates, they want to launch in the same direction as the satellites will orbit.

08:09.760 --> 08:13.640
For that reason they can't launch from Vandenberg as it has land to the east so SpaceX

08:13.640 --> 08:17.940
uses the launch pads on Cape Canaveral, Florida as they have the Atlantic Ocean to the east.

08:17.940 --> 08:22.760
In the case of Telstar 19 Vantage it was going in geosynchronous orbit in order to stay consistently

08:22.760 --> 08:26.880
over its service area so SSL needed to get the satellites all the way across the country

08:26.880 --> 08:27.880
to Florida.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.400
No matter where a satellite is going, it gets packed up into one of these specialized shipping

08:32.400 --> 08:33.400
containers.

08:33.400 --> 08:36.320
For travel to closer launch sites within the US they'll often drive.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.080
They'll put the container on a truck driven by trusted oversized vehicle drivers, have

08:40.080 --> 08:43.760
a lead vehicle checking for obstructions, a trailing vehicle watching to make sure nothing

08:43.760 --> 08:47.840
goes wrong, and for longer drives a motor home so drivers can swap out and rest while

08:47.840 --> 08:48.960
still moving.

08:48.960 --> 08:53.240
If the launch site is far, such as the ones overseas in French Guiana, in Kazakhstan,

08:53.240 --> 08:56.580
or even the further ones in the US such as Cape Canaveral, they'll fly the satellite

08:56.580 --> 08:59.200
over in an Antonov cargo plane.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.600
Satellites arrive to their launch site at least a month before their launch as there's

09:02.600 --> 09:04.700
plenty of last minute preparation to do.

09:04.700 --> 09:08.660
They have to perform additional testing to make sure nothing was damaged in transport,

09:08.660 --> 09:10.840
fuel it up, and mount it in the rocket.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.580
Once that happens, though, there's a period where there's really nothing for SSL to

09:14.580 --> 09:15.580
do.

09:15.580 --> 09:19.220
As they go through the process of the countdown there are a number of places where we're

09:19.220 --> 09:21.500
asked to confirm that we're ready for launch.

09:21.500 --> 09:28.020
Then they launch us and at that point we can no longer monitor our satellite until we're

09:28.020 --> 09:29.520
off the launch vehicle.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.920
So for about a half hour we're hoping that the launch vehicle guys are doing everything

09:34.920 --> 09:37.240
okay and they usually are.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.600
In the case of Telstar 19 Vantage, the customer entrusted SpaceX with the responsibility of

09:41.600 --> 09:47.920
getting their satellite to orbit so on July 22nd, 2018, at 1.50am, a Falcon 9 rocket lifted

09:47.920 --> 09:51.900
off from Cape Canaveral carrying SSL's latest creation to space.

09:51.900 --> 09:55.640
The launch of this satellite actually made the record books as it is the heaviest commercial

09:55.640 --> 10:01.200
communications satellite to ever be entered into service at 15,600 pounds.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.200
On that early morning in July, the Falcon 9 gained altitude as it flew southeast over

10:05.200 --> 10:11.480
Africa then 32 minutes and 40 seconds after launching, 358 miles above Mozambique, Telstar

10:11.480 --> 10:15.900
19 Vantage was released from the rocket and gently pushed forward in the first moments

10:15.900 --> 10:18.760
of its 15 year long orbit of earth.

10:18.760 --> 10:21.560
At that point, the work's not done for SSL though.

10:21.560 --> 10:26.940
Their job is not just to build the satellite but also to enter it into service in space.

10:26.940 --> 10:31.780
Once the satellite is deployed, SSL will look for its signal and establish communications.

10:31.780 --> 10:35.440
And then we start talking to the satellite so we start commanding the satellite, we tell

10:35.440 --> 10:41.500
the satellite what we want it to do, we start to get the satellite into a safe position

10:41.500 --> 10:46.920
after launch, we'll deploy solar rays so we can start generating power, we'll start

10:46.920 --> 10:51.440
to activate everything on the satellite, and then we'll put the satellite in a safe

10:51.440 --> 10:54.480
condition so that the crew can get some rest.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.720
Over the next ten days there's a process of firing the satellite's engines to raise

10:57.720 --> 11:02.600
it from the altitude of 350 miles where it's deployed to 22,000 miles where it will stay

11:02.600 --> 11:03.880
for its service life.

11:03.880 --> 11:08.420
There's then another two to four weeks of testing to make sure everything survived launch

11:08.420 --> 11:13.400
and then, finally, after years of work, it's time to hand over the satellite to Telesat,

11:13.400 --> 11:17.500
the customer, so they can put it online and start operating it commercially.

11:17.500 --> 11:23.760
At that point, after years of work, the satellite can finally itself be put to work.

11:23.760 --> 11:26.960
One of the aspects of how satellites work that I found most interesting to learn about

11:26.960 --> 11:29.780
when I filmed this video was on how orbits work.

11:29.780 --> 11:33.000
The science of how you can make an object orbit at such a consistent speed that it will

11:33.000 --> 11:37.340
stay over one particular area of earth is fascinating and if you want to learn all about

11:37.340 --> 11:41.820
how that works, Brilliant teaches you exactly that in their classical mechanics course.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.700
Of course, there's more than just orbits.

11:43.700 --> 11:47.720
This course provides a great overview of physics and with Brilliant, you'll actually understand

11:47.720 --> 11:49.960
the concepts rather than just learning them.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.800
They specialize in teaching the intuitive principles behind concepts so that you can

11:53.800 --> 11:55.360
learn the why.

11:55.360 --> 11:59.500
They also have plenty of other fascinating courses on topics like astronomy, logic, and

11:59.500 --> 12:03.340
gravitational physics—a course that teaches how planetary orbits work.

12:03.340 --> 12:07.460
All in all, Brilliant is a great place to learn and best of all, you can try Brilliant's

12:07.460 --> 12:12.420
