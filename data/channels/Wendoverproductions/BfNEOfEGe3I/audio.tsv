8120	12400	This is a 737 MAX—a brand new airplane.
12400	13400	Almost.
13400	16440	It has a few aspects that makes it unique.
16440	19800	Most modern airplanes have electronic pre-flight checklists.
19800	23440	The 737 MAX uses paper checklists.
23440	25980	Most modern airplanes can be turned on by flipping a switch.
25980	29560	The 737 MAX uses a seven-step process.
29560	33760	Most modern airplanes have electronic on-screen warnings describing exactly what a problem
33760	38000	is—the 737 MAX only has a warning light.
38000	42360	Most modern airplanes are fully fly-by-wire meaning their ailerons and elevators and other
42360	46980	flight control surfaces move by electronic signals triggering servo motors.
46980	51760	The 737 MAX has, running from the cockpit, physical cables, themselves pulling most of
51760	54140	the flight control surfaces to move.
54140	57000	Not all these design elements are necessarily bad things.
57000	61500	Many pilots, in fact, prefer the fly-by-cable system, for example, but there is one other
61500	65640	big difference between most modern airplanes and the 737 MAX.
65640	68740	Most modern airplanes are flying up above right now.
68740	71640	The 737 MAX is not.
71640	77280	These design elements are all indicators of a truth about the 737 MAX—it's a 50-year-old
77280	82360	airplane retooled, re-engined, and redesigned three times to make it what it is today.
82360	87840	It is the oldest major commercial plane type still being made today, and it shows.
87840	93180	Much of the design of the 737 MAX was done by people not even alive today.
93180	98080	The reason Boeing revamped and revamped and revamped this airplane over and over and over
98080	103240	again has to do with the economics of the aviation industry as a whole and one of the
103240	107280	world's fiercest rivalries—Boeing versus Airbus.
107280	111800	Back in 2011, rumblings were emerging that Boeing would design an all-new single-aisle
111800	114760	airplane to replace the rather old 737.
114760	118580	It seemed like the logical choice that would allow the manufacturer to design a far more
118580	123880	efficient aircraft unconstrained by the 737's old, metallic airframe and technologies.
123880	128180	The reason Boeing might not have chosen to scrap the 737 earlier, though, is because,
128180	132320	to airlines, fuel efficiency matters less for their short-haul planes.
132320	136440	That's partially just because smaller planes fly fewer hours per day.
136440	140880	Among American Airlines, for example, the average small narrow-body plane spends 8.2
140880	146000	hours airborne per day while the average wide-body plane spends 11.5 hours airborne.
146000	151360	Meanwhile, though, the average small narrow-body plane flies 4.5 flights per day whereas the
151360	154840	average wide-body flies just 1.5 per day.
154840	159080	Considering small planes fly shorter routes, they spend more time on the ground unloading
159080	160800	and loading between flights.
160800	165520	So, with fewer hours per day in the air, the proportion of cost devoted to fuel is lower
165520	168400	to operate small planes than big planes.
168440	173200	Additionally, airlines would rather have a cheap small plane rather than an expensive,
173200	174840	super-efficient small plane.
174840	178760	The 737 is just that—it's a cheap small plane.
178760	184800	The 737-700's list price is only $89 million and once airlines actually negotiate an order,
184800	187040	the real price is far less.
187040	191860	With over 50 years of experience, Boeing has perfected the 737 manufacturing process and
191860	195400	is therefore able to offer the plane at a relatively cheap price.
195400	199960	At their peak, Boeing was making one 737 every 14 hours.
199960	204760	So, in summary, when prioritizing which planes to buy, airlines are going to be more focused
204760	209160	on upgrading their long-haul, wide-body fleets to the newest, most fuel-efficient airplanes
209160	210960	than their small planes.
210960	214420	In the past decade or so, though, airlines have been changing how they've been using
214420	216360	narrow-body planes.
216360	222040	Planes like the 737, A320, and 757 have long been the core of almost any airline's short-haul
222040	225580	fleet, but they've started to be used for longer and longer flights.
225580	229080	These smaller planes are cheaper to operate and have been getting redesigned with longer
229080	233720	and longer range which allow airlines to operate longer routes with less demand that just couldn't
233720	235840	fill a larger, wide-body plane.
235840	239720	The fleet age of United's planes, for example, indicates just this.
239720	244080	You can see that the average age of most of their narrow-body fleet is from the late 1990s
244080	248100	and early 2000s while much of their wide-body fleet was put into service in the current
248100	249100	decade.
249260	252840	Going back to what's changed, you can see that with small narrow-body planes, over the
252840	257300	past 20 years, these planes are flying fewer and fewer flights per day while being airborne
257300	261700	for more and more hours per day meaning they're flying longer and longer routes.
261700	266900	In addition, in 2011, when Boeing was deciding what to do next with the 737 program, jet
266900	270680	fuel prices had reached close to an all-time high so airlines were more concerned than
270680	274140	ever about fuel efficiency, even for their smaller planes.
274180	279060	Therefore, the fuel efficiency of these small narrow-body planes was and is becoming more
279060	280420	and more important.
280420	285360	That, in addition to a general need to improve efficiency over time, was why Boeing was looking
285360	288740	to create an all-new narrow-body airplane.
288740	290540	But then reality hit.
290540	295280	On December 1st, 2010, Airbus announced that it would release a re-engined, more efficient
295280	299440	version of their A320 family aircraft—the A320neo.
299440	304120	Unfortunately for Boeing, the A320neo sold quite well in its first few months.
304120	308680	It was clear that airlines wanted a more efficient small plane and fast.
308680	310840	Soon after, something worse happened.
310840	314760	American Airlines, which was, at the time, one of the world's largest airlines, had
314760	317680	no Airbus planes in 2011.
317680	321720	All of their long-haul fleet and most of their shore-haul fleet was built by Boeing.
321720	329320	On July 20th, 2011, though, American announced a massive order for 460 narrow-body planes—130
329320	337400	Airbus A320s, 130 Airbus A320neos, 100 737s, and 100 re-engined 737s.
337400	342160	The press release said, American intends to order 100 of Boeing's expected new evolution
342160	346680	of the 737NG with a new engine that would offer even more significant fuel efficiency
346680	348720	gains over today's models.
348720	353720	At this point, this re-engined 737 had not been announced.
353720	357600	American announced an order for a non-existent plane.
357600	363080	They strong-armed Boeing into re-engining their 737 rather than building a new airplane
363080	367080	by dangling an order of this hypothetical revamped airplane over them.
367080	372100	It's likely that Boeing had already agreed internally to re-engine the plane, but nonetheless,
372100	374300	why would American do that?
374300	380160	Why would they want a less efficient, less modern, re-engined 737 over a more modern,
380160	383400	more efficient, brand new narrow-body plane?
383400	388600	Well, in short, it's because fuel cost is far from all the cost.
388600	393760	Pilots are generally trained to operate just one type of aircraft—some fly the A380,
393760	400280	some fly the 777, some fly the A320, and some fly the 737, but they don't fly the 737-700
400280	406880	or 737-800 or 737-900, they fly the 737 airplane as a whole.
406880	410860	Pilots are trained to the aircraft, not the specific aircraft variant.
410860	416100	In general, pilots can and do switch between variants of aircraft even in any given day
416100	420140	and are not required to do any substantial training to be certified on different aircraft
420140	421140	variants.
421140	426580	Crucially, the FAA has never required that 737 pilots complete any simulator training
426580	429340	before flying new 737 variants.
429340	435960	That's because a 50-year-old 737 more or less flies like a one-year-old 737.
435960	441020	Japan wanted a refreshed 737 over a new plane since they already had thousands of trained
441020	443680	and certified 737 pilots.
443680	447840	They had no pilots for a hypothetical new narrow-body Boeing, and the cost of training
447840	450980	their pilots to a new plane would be massive.
450980	454880	Even ignoring the training costs, though, it's far cheaper for airlines to just have
454880	459680	one large fleet of one type of aircraft rather than a few smaller fleets of different aircraft.
459680	464860	That's why budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Southwest each operate only one
464860	466060	aircraft type.
466060	470580	It costs less to just have one group of pilots and mechanics that can work on all the planes
470580	475100	and that's why most airlines try to have as few different aircraft types as possible.
475100	481160	So, soon after American's order announcement, Boeing officially announced the 737 MAX.
481160	485520	This aircraft would be 15% more fuel-efficient than the previous 737 model and would therefore
485520	492500	have a maximum range of 4,400 miles or 7,100 kilometers compared to the old 737's 3,400
492500	494900	mile or 5,400 kilometer range.
494900	499460	This would make it easily possible to operate transatlantic flights on this small, narrow-body
499460	500460	plane.
500460	505220	Airlines did end up taking advantage of this range to operate long, yet low-demand routes.
505220	509700	For example, Air Canada operated transatlantic flights from Halifax and St. John's to London
509700	512260	Heathrow using the 737 MAX.
512260	516380	Norwegian Airlines flew them as far as Newburgh, New York to Bergen, Norway.
516380	520820	Goal Airlines, meanwhile, broke records with their daily 737 MAX flights all the way from
520820	525020	Brasilia, Brazil to Miami, Florida—an up to eight-hour flight.
525020	529140	To achieve the fuel efficiency and range improvements that made these flights possible, though,
529140	535020	Boeing had to make a crucial change to the aircraft—they had to fit bigger engines.
535020	538980	Without getting too much into the engineering, the newest, most efficient engines are all
538980	543700	physically larger than those of the past due to designs that have more air bypass and flow
543700	545580	past the engine core.
545580	550780	The problem, though, was that the 737 design was quite low to the ground.
550780	555220	Back 50 years ago, when the aircraft was designed, this was a conscious choice.
555220	559220	It was a feature that made it easy to load bangs without a conveyor belt and maintain
559220	561140	engines without a lift.
561140	564940	This simplified operating to many of the less-developed airports of that time.
564940	569320	The proximity to the ground was no problem for the first generation of 737 that had long
569320	571700	and thin engines that looked like this.
571700	576400	For the second generation, though, the 737 Classic, Boeing moved the engine further forward
576400	580740	and up and designed its intake as non-circular to achieve more ground clearance.
580740	585740	The next generation also kept this design, but then for the 737 MAX, they just had to
585740	587900	fit an even larger engine.
587900	593000	So, they put it even further forward and up in addition to adding 8 inches or 20 centimeters
593000	594300	to the nose gear.
594300	599380	These changes, though, changed the aerodynamics of the plane and therefore how it handled.
599380	603120	It would cause the plane to pitch up more than the last generation which would put it
603120	605140	at a greater risk of stalling.
605140	611020	So, they installed a system called MCAS—the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.
611020	614620	This system would activate when it sensed the aircraft's angle of attack was too high
614620	618420	and would automatically rotate the horizontal stabilizer to cause the aircraft's nose
618420	619720	to pitch down.
619720	623760	The aircraft figures out its angle of attack, though, through a sensor and if this sensor
623760	630020	is broken, it can cause the aircraft to think it is flying at too high of an angle and self-correct.
630180	635600	Unless the system is deactivated, it can keep pitching the aircraft down until the ground.
635600	640140	It is this that is believed to have been the cause of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610
640140	646060	in October, 2018 and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March, 2019 and it
646060	651140	is these that led to the grounding of every single 737 MAX in the world.
651140	656660	Boeing found itself, back in 2011, in a position where it had to choose between the easy wrong
656660	658320	or the difficult right.
658320	663240	It had to choose between short-term and long-term gain and it chose to win now.
663240	667480	It chose to push the limits of an old design to a point where it required correction upon
667480	670800	correction to even make it the same plane.
670800	675600	Given the storm of economic pressures surrounding the company in 2011, though, Boeing's investors
675600	680320	would not have been happy if the company embarked on a long, expensive new aircraft design process
680320	683960	while Airbus engulfed market share with their A320neo.
683960	687760	Nobody would have guessed at the time, with the company and aircraft's phenomenal safety
687760	691840	record, that the decision would lead to a potentially faulty plane.
691840	696400	Nobody would have guessed that the decision would potentially cost hundreds of lives.
696400	703120	It was a hasty decision made by hasty human brains and for that, Boeing, and its 737 program,
703120	707280	will suffer long-term, possibly permanent, consequences.
707280	712880	I've just redone the Wendover Productions website with Wix which was a great, simple,
712880	714200	and quick process.
714640	717860	One of the things I like about Wix is that they have a few different ways that you can
717860	721740	make your site depending on your experience level and how much time you want to take.
721740	725360	You can have them make it for you using their artificial design intelligence, you can make
725360	729560	it yourself using the Wix editor, or for the experienced, you can code your website easily
729560	732560	with a bunch of extra features using their Corvid system.
732560	737160	Personally, I used the Wix editor and was able to quickly make a site that I think looks
737160	738400	quite good.
738400	742280	Their designer templates and drag-and-drop website builder made it quite easy.
742360	747300	Wix's paid plans are all quite reasonably priced and even include a custom domain name
747300	753320	but you can start building your website today for free at wix.com slash go slash wendover.
