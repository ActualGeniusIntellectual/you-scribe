00:08.120 --> 00:12.400
This is a 737 MAX—a brand new airplane.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.400
Almost.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.440
It has a few aspects that makes it unique.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.800
Most modern airplanes have electronic pre-flight checklists.

00:19.800 --> 00:23.440
The 737 MAX uses paper checklists.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.980
Most modern airplanes can be turned on by flipping a switch.

00:25.980 --> 00:29.560
The 737 MAX uses a seven-step process.

00:29.560 --> 00:33.760
Most modern airplanes have electronic on-screen warnings describing exactly what a problem

00:33.760 --> 00:38.000
is—the 737 MAX only has a warning light.

00:38.000 --> 00:42.360
Most modern airplanes are fully fly-by-wire meaning their ailerons and elevators and other

00:42.360 --> 00:46.980
flight control surfaces move by electronic signals triggering servo motors.

00:46.980 --> 00:51.760
The 737 MAX has, running from the cockpit, physical cables, themselves pulling most of

00:51.760 --> 00:54.140
the flight control surfaces to move.

00:54.140 --> 00:57.000
Not all these design elements are necessarily bad things.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.500
Many pilots, in fact, prefer the fly-by-cable system, for example, but there is one other

01:01.500 --> 01:05.640
big difference between most modern airplanes and the 737 MAX.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.740
Most modern airplanes are flying up above right now.

01:08.740 --> 01:11.640
The 737 MAX is not.

01:11.640 --> 01:17.280
These design elements are all indicators of a truth about the 737 MAX—it's a 50-year-old

01:17.280 --> 01:22.360
airplane retooled, re-engined, and redesigned three times to make it what it is today.

01:22.360 --> 01:27.840
It is the oldest major commercial plane type still being made today, and it shows.

01:27.840 --> 01:33.180
Much of the design of the 737 MAX was done by people not even alive today.

01:33.180 --> 01:38.080
The reason Boeing revamped and revamped and revamped this airplane over and over and over

01:38.080 --> 01:43.240
again has to do with the economics of the aviation industry as a whole and one of the

01:43.240 --> 01:47.280
world's fiercest rivalries—Boeing versus Airbus.

01:47.280 --> 01:51.800
Back in 2011, rumblings were emerging that Boeing would design an all-new single-aisle

01:51.800 --> 01:54.760
airplane to replace the rather old 737.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.580
It seemed like the logical choice that would allow the manufacturer to design a far more

01:58.580 --> 02:03.880
efficient aircraft unconstrained by the 737's old, metallic airframe and technologies.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.180
The reason Boeing might not have chosen to scrap the 737 earlier, though, is because,

02:08.180 --> 02:12.320
to airlines, fuel efficiency matters less for their short-haul planes.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.440
That's partially just because smaller planes fly fewer hours per day.

02:16.440 --> 02:20.880
Among American Airlines, for example, the average small narrow-body plane spends 8.2

02:20.880 --> 02:26.000
hours airborne per day while the average wide-body plane spends 11.5 hours airborne.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.360
Meanwhile, though, the average small narrow-body plane flies 4.5 flights per day whereas the

02:31.360 --> 02:34.840
average wide-body flies just 1.5 per day.

02:34.840 --> 02:39.080
Considering small planes fly shorter routes, they spend more time on the ground unloading

02:39.080 --> 02:40.800
and loading between flights.

02:40.800 --> 02:45.520
So, with fewer hours per day in the air, the proportion of cost devoted to fuel is lower

02:45.520 --> 02:48.400
to operate small planes than big planes.

02:48.440 --> 02:53.200
Additionally, airlines would rather have a cheap small plane rather than an expensive,

02:53.200 --> 02:54.840
super-efficient small plane.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.760
The 737 is just that—it's a cheap small plane.

02:58.760 --> 03:04.800
The 737-700's list price is only $89 million and once airlines actually negotiate an order,

03:04.800 --> 03:07.040
the real price is far less.

03:07.040 --> 03:11.860
With over 50 years of experience, Boeing has perfected the 737 manufacturing process and

03:11.860 --> 03:15.400
is therefore able to offer the plane at a relatively cheap price.

03:15.400 --> 03:19.960
At their peak, Boeing was making one 737 every 14 hours.

03:19.960 --> 03:24.760
So, in summary, when prioritizing which planes to buy, airlines are going to be more focused

03:24.760 --> 03:29.160
on upgrading their long-haul, wide-body fleets to the newest, most fuel-efficient airplanes

03:29.160 --> 03:30.960
than their small planes.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.420
In the past decade or so, though, airlines have been changing how they've been using

03:34.420 --> 03:36.360
narrow-body planes.

03:36.360 --> 03:42.040
Planes like the 737, A320, and 757 have long been the core of almost any airline's short-haul

03:42.040 --> 03:45.580
fleet, but they've started to be used for longer and longer flights.

03:45.580 --> 03:49.080
These smaller planes are cheaper to operate and have been getting redesigned with longer

03:49.080 --> 03:53.720
and longer range which allow airlines to operate longer routes with less demand that just couldn't

03:53.720 --> 03:55.840
fill a larger, wide-body plane.

03:55.840 --> 03:59.720
The fleet age of United's planes, for example, indicates just this.

03:59.720 --> 04:04.080
You can see that the average age of most of their narrow-body fleet is from the late 1990s

04:04.080 --> 04:08.100
and early 2000s while much of their wide-body fleet was put into service in the current

04:08.100 --> 04:09.100
decade.

04:09.260 --> 04:12.840
Going back to what's changed, you can see that with small narrow-body planes, over the

04:12.840 --> 04:17.300
past 20 years, these planes are flying fewer and fewer flights per day while being airborne

04:17.300 --> 04:21.700
for more and more hours per day meaning they're flying longer and longer routes.

04:21.700 --> 04:26.900
In addition, in 2011, when Boeing was deciding what to do next with the 737 program, jet

04:26.900 --> 04:30.680
fuel prices had reached close to an all-time high so airlines were more concerned than

04:30.680 --> 04:34.140
ever about fuel efficiency, even for their smaller planes.

04:34.180 --> 04:39.060
Therefore, the fuel efficiency of these small narrow-body planes was and is becoming more

04:39.060 --> 04:40.420
and more important.

04:40.420 --> 04:45.360
That, in addition to a general need to improve efficiency over time, was why Boeing was looking

04:45.360 --> 04:48.740
to create an all-new narrow-body airplane.

04:48.740 --> 04:50.540
But then reality hit.

04:50.540 --> 04:55.280
On December 1st, 2010, Airbus announced that it would release a re-engined, more efficient

04:55.280 --> 04:59.440
version of their A320 family aircraft—the A320neo.

04:59.440 --> 05:04.120
Unfortunately for Boeing, the A320neo sold quite well in its first few months.

05:04.120 --> 05:08.680
It was clear that airlines wanted a more efficient small plane and fast.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.840
Soon after, something worse happened.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.760
American Airlines, which was, at the time, one of the world's largest airlines, had

05:14.760 --> 05:17.680
no Airbus planes in 2011.

05:17.680 --> 05:21.720
All of their long-haul fleet and most of their shore-haul fleet was built by Boeing.

05:21.720 --> 05:29.320
On July 20th, 2011, though, American announced a massive order for 460 narrow-body planes—130

05:29.320 --> 05:37.400
Airbus A320s, 130 Airbus A320neos, 100 737s, and 100 re-engined 737s.

05:37.400 --> 05:42.160
The press release said, American intends to order 100 of Boeing's expected new evolution

05:42.160 --> 05:46.680
of the 737NG with a new engine that would offer even more significant fuel efficiency

05:46.680 --> 05:48.720
gains over today's models.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.720
At this point, this re-engined 737 had not been announced.

05:53.720 --> 05:57.600
American announced an order for a non-existent plane.

05:57.600 --> 06:03.080
They strong-armed Boeing into re-engining their 737 rather than building a new airplane

06:03.080 --> 06:07.080
by dangling an order of this hypothetical revamped airplane over them.

06:07.080 --> 06:12.100
It's likely that Boeing had already agreed internally to re-engine the plane, but nonetheless,

06:12.100 --> 06:14.300
why would American do that?

06:14.300 --> 06:20.160
Why would they want a less efficient, less modern, re-engined 737 over a more modern,

06:20.160 --> 06:23.400
more efficient, brand new narrow-body plane?

06:23.400 --> 06:28.600
Well, in short, it's because fuel cost is far from all the cost.

06:28.600 --> 06:33.760
Pilots are generally trained to operate just one type of aircraft—some fly the A380,

06:33.760 --> 06:40.280
some fly the 777, some fly the A320, and some fly the 737, but they don't fly the 737-700

06:40.280 --> 06:46.880
or 737-800 or 737-900, they fly the 737 airplane as a whole.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.860
Pilots are trained to the aircraft, not the specific aircraft variant.

06:50.860 --> 06:56.100
In general, pilots can and do switch between variants of aircraft even in any given day

06:56.100 --> 07:00.140
and are not required to do any substantial training to be certified on different aircraft

07:00.140 --> 07:01.140
variants.

07:01.140 --> 07:06.580
Crucially, the FAA has never required that 737 pilots complete any simulator training

07:06.580 --> 07:09.340
before flying new 737 variants.

07:09.340 --> 07:15.960
That's because a 50-year-old 737 more or less flies like a one-year-old 737.

07:15.960 --> 07:21.020
Japan wanted a refreshed 737 over a new plane since they already had thousands of trained

07:21.020 --> 07:23.680
and certified 737 pilots.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.840
They had no pilots for a hypothetical new narrow-body Boeing, and the cost of training

07:27.840 --> 07:30.980
their pilots to a new plane would be massive.

07:30.980 --> 07:34.880
Even ignoring the training costs, though, it's far cheaper for airlines to just have

07:34.880 --> 07:39.680
one large fleet of one type of aircraft rather than a few smaller fleets of different aircraft.

07:39.680 --> 07:44.860
That's why budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Southwest each operate only one

07:44.860 --> 07:46.060
aircraft type.

07:46.060 --> 07:50.580
It costs less to just have one group of pilots and mechanics that can work on all the planes

07:50.580 --> 07:55.100
and that's why most airlines try to have as few different aircraft types as possible.

07:55.100 --> 08:01.160
So, soon after American's order announcement, Boeing officially announced the 737 MAX.

08:01.160 --> 08:05.520
This aircraft would be 15% more fuel-efficient than the previous 737 model and would therefore

08:05.520 --> 08:12.500
have a maximum range of 4,400 miles or 7,100 kilometers compared to the old 737's 3,400

08:12.500 --> 08:14.900
mile or 5,400 kilometer range.

08:14.900 --> 08:19.460
This would make it easily possible to operate transatlantic flights on this small, narrow-body

08:19.460 --> 08:20.460
plane.

08:20.460 --> 08:25.220
Airlines did end up taking advantage of this range to operate long, yet low-demand routes.

08:25.220 --> 08:29.700
For example, Air Canada operated transatlantic flights from Halifax and St. John's to London

08:29.700 --> 08:32.260
Heathrow using the 737 MAX.

08:32.260 --> 08:36.380
Norwegian Airlines flew them as far as Newburgh, New York to Bergen, Norway.

08:36.380 --> 08:40.820
Goal Airlines, meanwhile, broke records with their daily 737 MAX flights all the way from

08:40.820 --> 08:45.020
Brasilia, Brazil to Miami, Florida—an up to eight-hour flight.

08:45.020 --> 08:49.140
To achieve the fuel efficiency and range improvements that made these flights possible, though,

08:49.140 --> 08:55.020
Boeing had to make a crucial change to the aircraft—they had to fit bigger engines.

08:55.020 --> 08:58.980
Without getting too much into the engineering, the newest, most efficient engines are all

08:58.980 --> 09:03.700
physically larger than those of the past due to designs that have more air bypass and flow

09:03.700 --> 09:05.580
past the engine core.

09:05.580 --> 09:10.780
The problem, though, was that the 737 design was quite low to the ground.

09:10.780 --> 09:15.220
Back 50 years ago, when the aircraft was designed, this was a conscious choice.

09:15.220 --> 09:19.220
It was a feature that made it easy to load bangs without a conveyor belt and maintain

09:19.220 --> 09:21.140
engines without a lift.

09:21.140 --> 09:24.940
This simplified operating to many of the less-developed airports of that time.

09:24.940 --> 09:29.320
The proximity to the ground was no problem for the first generation of 737 that had long

09:29.320 --> 09:31.700
and thin engines that looked like this.

09:31.700 --> 09:36.400
For the second generation, though, the 737 Classic, Boeing moved the engine further forward

09:36.400 --> 09:40.740
and up and designed its intake as non-circular to achieve more ground clearance.

09:40.740 --> 09:45.740
The next generation also kept this design, but then for the 737 MAX, they just had to

09:45.740 --> 09:47.900
fit an even larger engine.

09:47.900 --> 09:53.000
So, they put it even further forward and up in addition to adding 8 inches or 20 centimeters

09:53.000 --> 09:54.300
to the nose gear.

09:54.300 --> 09:59.380
These changes, though, changed the aerodynamics of the plane and therefore how it handled.

09:59.380 --> 10:03.120
It would cause the plane to pitch up more than the last generation which would put it

10:03.120 --> 10:05.140
at a greater risk of stalling.

10:05.140 --> 10:11.020
So, they installed a system called MCAS—the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.

10:11.020 --> 10:14.620
This system would activate when it sensed the aircraft's angle of attack was too high

10:14.620 --> 10:18.420
and would automatically rotate the horizontal stabilizer to cause the aircraft's nose

10:18.420 --> 10:19.720
to pitch down.

10:19.720 --> 10:23.760
The aircraft figures out its angle of attack, though, through a sensor and if this sensor

10:23.760 --> 10:30.020
is broken, it can cause the aircraft to think it is flying at too high of an angle and self-correct.

10:30.180 --> 10:35.600
Unless the system is deactivated, it can keep pitching the aircraft down until the ground.

10:35.600 --> 10:40.140
It is this that is believed to have been the cause of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610

10:40.140 --> 10:46.060
in October, 2018 and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March, 2019 and it

10:46.060 --> 10:51.140
is these that led to the grounding of every single 737 MAX in the world.

10:51.140 --> 10:56.660
Boeing found itself, back in 2011, in a position where it had to choose between the easy wrong

10:56.660 --> 10:58.320
or the difficult right.

10:58.320 --> 11:03.240
It had to choose between short-term and long-term gain and it chose to win now.

11:03.240 --> 11:07.480
It chose to push the limits of an old design to a point where it required correction upon

11:07.480 --> 11:10.800
correction to even make it the same plane.

11:10.800 --> 11:15.600
Given the storm of economic pressures surrounding the company in 2011, though, Boeing's investors

11:15.600 --> 11:20.320
would not have been happy if the company embarked on a long, expensive new aircraft design process

11:20.320 --> 11:23.960
while Airbus engulfed market share with their A320neo.

11:23.960 --> 11:27.760
Nobody would have guessed at the time, with the company and aircraft's phenomenal safety

11:27.760 --> 11:31.840
record, that the decision would lead to a potentially faulty plane.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.400
Nobody would have guessed that the decision would potentially cost hundreds of lives.

11:36.400 --> 11:43.120
It was a hasty decision made by hasty human brains and for that, Boeing, and its 737 program,

11:43.120 --> 11:47.280
will suffer long-term, possibly permanent, consequences.

11:47.280 --> 11:52.880
I've just redone the Wendover Productions website with Wix which was a great, simple,

11:52.880 --> 11:54.200
and quick process.

11:54.640 --> 11:57.860
One of the things I like about Wix is that they have a few different ways that you can

11:57.860 --> 12:01.740
make your site depending on your experience level and how much time you want to take.

12:01.740 --> 12:05.360
You can have them make it for you using their artificial design intelligence, you can make

12:05.360 --> 12:09.560
it yourself using the Wix editor, or for the experienced, you can code your website easily

12:09.560 --> 12:12.560
with a bunch of extra features using their Corvid system.

12:12.560 --> 12:17.160
Personally, I used the Wix editor and was able to quickly make a site that I think looks

12:17.160 --> 12:18.400
quite good.

12:18.400 --> 12:22.280
Their designer templates and drag-and-drop website builder made it quite easy.

12:22.360 --> 12:27.300
Wix's paid plans are all quite reasonably priced and even include a custom domain name

12:27.300 --> 12:33.320
