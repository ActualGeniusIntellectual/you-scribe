3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,400
This is a 737 MAX—a brand new airplane.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Almost.

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,440
It has a few aspects that makes it unique.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,800
Most modern airplanes have electronic pre-flight checklists.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,440
The 737 MAX uses paper checklists.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,980
Most modern airplanes can be turned on by flipping a switch.

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,560
The 737 MAX uses a seven-step process.

10
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,760
Most modern airplanes have electronic on-screen warnings describing exactly what a problem

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,000
is—the 737 MAX only has a warning light.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,360
Most modern airplanes are fully fly-by-wire meaning their ailerons and elevators and other

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,980
flight control surfaces move by electronic signals triggering servo motors.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,760
The 737 MAX has, running from the cockpit, physical cables, themselves pulling most of

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,140
the flight control surfaces to move.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,000
Not all these design elements are necessarily bad things.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,500
Many pilots, in fact, prefer the fly-by-cable system, for example, but there is one other

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,640
big difference between most modern airplanes and the 737 MAX.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,740
Most modern airplanes are flying up above right now.

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,640
The 737 MAX is not.

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,280
These design elements are all indicators of a truth about the 737 MAX—it's a 50-year-old

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,360
airplane retooled, re-engined, and redesigned three times to make it what it is today.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,840
It is the oldest major commercial plane type still being made today, and it shows.

24
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,180
Much of the design of the 737 MAX was done by people not even alive today.

25
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,080
The reason Boeing revamped and revamped and revamped this airplane over and over and over

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,240
again has to do with the economics of the aviation industry as a whole and one of the

27
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,280
world's fiercest rivalries—Boeing versus Airbus.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,800
Back in 2011, rumblings were emerging that Boeing would design an all-new single-aisle

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,760
airplane to replace the rather old 737.

30
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,580
It seemed like the logical choice that would allow the manufacturer to design a far more

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:03,880
efficient aircraft unconstrained by the 737's old, metallic airframe and technologies.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,180
The reason Boeing might not have chosen to scrap the 737 earlier, though, is because,

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,320
to airlines, fuel efficiency matters less for their short-haul planes.

34
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,440
That's partially just because smaller planes fly fewer hours per day.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,880
Among American Airlines, for example, the average small narrow-body plane spends 8.2

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,000
hours airborne per day while the average wide-body plane spends 11.5 hours airborne.

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,360
Meanwhile, though, the average small narrow-body plane flies 4.5 flights per day whereas the

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,840
average wide-body flies just 1.5 per day.

39
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,080
Considering small planes fly shorter routes, they spend more time on the ground unloading

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,800
and loading between flights.

41
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,520
So, with fewer hours per day in the air, the proportion of cost devoted to fuel is lower

42
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,400
to operate small planes than big planes.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,200
Additionally, airlines would rather have a cheap small plane rather than an expensive,

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,840
super-efficient small plane.

45
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,760
The 737 is just that—it's a cheap small plane.

46
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,800
The 737-700's list price is only $89 million and once airlines actually negotiate an order,

47
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,040
the real price is far less.

48
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,860
With over 50 years of experience, Boeing has perfected the 737 manufacturing process and

49
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,400
is therefore able to offer the plane at a relatively cheap price.

50
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,960
At their peak, Boeing was making one 737 every 14 hours.

51
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,760
So, in summary, when prioritizing which planes to buy, airlines are going to be more focused

52
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,160
on upgrading their long-haul, wide-body fleets to the newest, most fuel-efficient airplanes

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,960
than their small planes.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,420
In the past decade or so, though, airlines have been changing how they've been using

55
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,360
narrow-body planes.

56
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:42,040
Planes like the 737, A320, and 757 have long been the core of almost any airline's short-haul

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,580
fleet, but they've started to be used for longer and longer flights.

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,080
These smaller planes are cheaper to operate and have been getting redesigned with longer

59
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,720
and longer range which allow airlines to operate longer routes with less demand that just couldn't

60
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,840
fill a larger, wide-body plane.

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,720
The fleet age of United's planes, for example, indicates just this.

62
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,080
You can see that the average age of most of their narrow-body fleet is from the late 1990s

63
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,100
and early 2000s while much of their wide-body fleet was put into service in the current

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
decade.

65
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,840
Going back to what's changed, you can see that with small narrow-body planes, over the

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,300
past 20 years, these planes are flying fewer and fewer flights per day while being airborne

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,700
for more and more hours per day meaning they're flying longer and longer routes.

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,900
In addition, in 2011, when Boeing was deciding what to do next with the 737 program, jet

69
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,680
fuel prices had reached close to an all-time high so airlines were more concerned than

70
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,140
ever about fuel efficiency, even for their smaller planes.

71
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,060
Therefore, the fuel efficiency of these small narrow-body planes was and is becoming more

72
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,420
and more important.

73
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,360
That, in addition to a general need to improve efficiency over time, was why Boeing was looking

74
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,740
to create an all-new narrow-body airplane.

75
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,540
But then reality hit.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,280
On December 1st, 2010, Airbus announced that it would release a re-engined, more efficient

77
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
version of their A320 family aircraft—the A320neo.

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,120
Unfortunately for Boeing, the A320neo sold quite well in its first few months.

79
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,680
It was clear that airlines wanted a more efficient small plane and fast.

80
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,840
Soon after, something worse happened.

81
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,760
American Airlines, which was, at the time, one of the world's largest airlines, had

82
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,680
no Airbus planes in 2011.

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,720
All of their long-haul fleet and most of their shore-haul fleet was built by Boeing.

84
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,320
On July 20th, 2011, though, American announced a massive order for 460 narrow-body planes—130

85
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:37,400
Airbus A320s, 130 Airbus A320neos, 100 737s, and 100 re-engined 737s.

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,160
The press release said, American intends to order 100 of Boeing's expected new evolution

87
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,680
of the 737NG with a new engine that would offer even more significant fuel efficiency

88
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,720
gains over today's models.

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
At this point, this re-engined 737 had not been announced.

90
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,600
American announced an order for a non-existent plane.

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,080
They strong-armed Boeing into re-engining their 737 rather than building a new airplane

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,080
by dangling an order of this hypothetical revamped airplane over them.

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,100
It's likely that Boeing had already agreed internally to re-engine the plane, but nonetheless,

94
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,300
why would American do that?

95
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,160
Why would they want a less efficient, less modern, re-engined 737 over a more modern,

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,400
more efficient, brand new narrow-body plane?

97
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,600
Well, in short, it's because fuel cost is far from all the cost.

98
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,760
Pilots are generally trained to operate just one type of aircraft—some fly the A380,

99
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:40,280
some fly the 777, some fly the A320, and some fly the 737, but they don't fly the 737-700

100
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,880
or 737-800 or 737-900, they fly the 737 airplane as a whole.

101
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,860
Pilots are trained to the aircraft, not the specific aircraft variant.

102
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:56,100
In general, pilots can and do switch between variants of aircraft even in any given day

103
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,140
and are not required to do any substantial training to be certified on different aircraft

104
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
variants.

105
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:06,580
Crucially, the FAA has never required that 737 pilots complete any simulator training

106
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,340
before flying new 737 variants.

107
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,960
That's because a 50-year-old 737 more or less flies like a one-year-old 737.

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,020
Japan wanted a refreshed 737 over a new plane since they already had thousands of trained

109
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,680
and certified 737 pilots.

110
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,840
They had no pilots for a hypothetical new narrow-body Boeing, and the cost of training

111
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,980
their pilots to a new plane would be massive.

112
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,880
Even ignoring the training costs, though, it's far cheaper for airlines to just have

113
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,680
one large fleet of one type of aircraft rather than a few smaller fleets of different aircraft.

114
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,860
That's why budget airlines like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Southwest each operate only one

115
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,060
aircraft type.

116
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,580
It costs less to just have one group of pilots and mechanics that can work on all the planes

117
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,100
and that's why most airlines try to have as few different aircraft types as possible.

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:01,160
So, soon after American's order announcement, Boeing officially announced the 737 MAX.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,520
This aircraft would be 15% more fuel-efficient than the previous 737 model and would therefore

120
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,500
have a maximum range of 4,400 miles or 7,100 kilometers compared to the old 737's 3,400

121
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,900
mile or 5,400 kilometer range.

122
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,460
This would make it easily possible to operate transatlantic flights on this small, narrow-body

123
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,460
plane.

124
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:25,220
Airlines did end up taking advantage of this range to operate long, yet low-demand routes.

125
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,700
For example, Air Canada operated transatlantic flights from Halifax and St. John's to London

126
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,260
Heathrow using the 737 MAX.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,380
Norwegian Airlines flew them as far as Newburgh, New York to Bergen, Norway.

128
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,820
Goal Airlines, meanwhile, broke records with their daily 737 MAX flights all the way from

129
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:45,020
Brasilia, Brazil to Miami, Florida—an up to eight-hour flight.

130
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,140
To achieve the fuel efficiency and range improvements that made these flights possible, though,

131
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,020
Boeing had to make a crucial change to the aircraft—they had to fit bigger engines.

132
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,980
Without getting too much into the engineering, the newest, most efficient engines are all

133
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,700
physically larger than those of the past due to designs that have more air bypass and flow

134
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,580
past the engine core.

135
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,780
The problem, though, was that the 737 design was quite low to the ground.

136
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,220
Back 50 years ago, when the aircraft was designed, this was a conscious choice.

137
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,220
It was a feature that made it easy to load bangs without a conveyor belt and maintain

138
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,140
engines without a lift.

139
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,940
This simplified operating to many of the less-developed airports of that time.

140
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,320
The proximity to the ground was no problem for the first generation of 737 that had long

141
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,700
and thin engines that looked like this.

142
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,400
For the second generation, though, the 737 Classic, Boeing moved the engine further forward

143
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,740
and up and designed its intake as non-circular to achieve more ground clearance.

144
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,740
The next generation also kept this design, but then for the 737 MAX, they just had to

145
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,900
fit an even larger engine.

146
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,000
So, they put it even further forward and up in addition to adding 8 inches or 20 centimeters

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,300
to the nose gear.

148
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,380
These changes, though, changed the aerodynamics of the plane and therefore how it handled.

149
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,120
It would cause the plane to pitch up more than the last generation which would put it

150
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,140
at a greater risk of stalling.

151
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,020
So, they installed a system called MCAS—the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.

152
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,620
This system would activate when it sensed the aircraft's angle of attack was too high

153
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,420
and would automatically rotate the horizontal stabilizer to cause the aircraft's nose

154
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,720
to pitch down.

155
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,760
The aircraft figures out its angle of attack, though, through a sensor and if this sensor

156
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,020
is broken, it can cause the aircraft to think it is flying at too high of an angle and self-correct.

157
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,600
Unless the system is deactivated, it can keep pitching the aircraft down until the ground.

158
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,140
It is this that is believed to have been the cause of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610

159
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,060
in October, 2018 and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March, 2019 and it

160
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:51,140
is these that led to the grounding of every single 737 MAX in the world.

161
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,660
Boeing found itself, back in 2011, in a position where it had to choose between the easy wrong

162
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,320
or the difficult right.

163
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,240
It had to choose between short-term and long-term gain and it chose to win now.

164
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,480
It chose to push the limits of an old design to a point where it required correction upon

165
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,800
correction to even make it the same plane.

166
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,600
Given the storm of economic pressures surrounding the company in 2011, though, Boeing's investors

167
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,320
would not have been happy if the company embarked on a long, expensive new aircraft design process

168
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,960
while Airbus engulfed market share with their A320neo.

169
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Nobody would have guessed at the time, with the company and aircraft's phenomenal safety

170
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,840
record, that the decision would lead to a potentially faulty plane.

171
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,400
Nobody would have guessed that the decision would potentially cost hundreds of lives.

172
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:43,120
It was a hasty decision made by hasty human brains and for that, Boeing, and its 737 program,

173
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,280
will suffer long-term, possibly permanent, consequences.

174
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,880
I've just redone the Wendover Productions website with Wix which was a great, simple,

175
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,200
and quick process.

176
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,860
One of the things I like about Wix is that they have a few different ways that you can

177
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,740
make your site depending on your experience level and how much time you want to take.

178
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,360
You can have them make it for you using their artificial design intelligence, you can make

179
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,560
it yourself using the Wix editor, or for the experienced, you can code your website easily

180
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,560
with a bunch of extra features using their Corvid system.

181
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,160
Personally, I used the Wix editor and was able to quickly make a site that I think looks

182
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,400
quite good.

183
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,280
Their designer templates and drag-and-drop website builder made it quite easy.

184
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,300
Wix's paid plans are all quite reasonably priced and even include a custom domain name

185
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,320
but you can start building your website today for free at wix.com slash go slash wendover.
