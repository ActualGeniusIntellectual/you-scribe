00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,360
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,040
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,280
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,280
Today we're going to take a trip.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,920
We're going to slip the surly bonds of earth up into the heavens.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,840
We're traveling through the galaxy to learn about timekeeping on the red planet—Mars.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,240
But before we can understand timekeeping on Mars, we first have to understand timekeeping

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
on earth.

14
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Dammit.

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:47,880
Can we turn this thing around?

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,320
Alright so this is the Greenwich Observatory in England.

17
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Greenwich is known for being the site of the prime meridian.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,680
For all intents and purposes, this is the longitudinal center of earth.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,840
For simplicity's sake, we'll say that time is determined based on the sun.

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,280
This isn't exactly true though, so I have a whole other video that explains time in

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,620
more detail.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,720
When the sun is highest in the sky at any given location, we call that noon and the

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,700
rest of the day's time is relative to this.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,820
So now let's go south to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,800
We find ourselves in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,680
Similar to how the prime meridian is the longitudinal center of the earth, the equator

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,180
is the latitudinal center of the earth.

28
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,560
At this point of 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude, it's noon because the

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,920
sun is at its highest point in the sky.

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,120
Great, now if we go 1,035 miles east we find ourselves in the lovely village of Atumbi

31
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,860
in the Republic of the Congo.

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,280
In Atumbi, the time is 1 pm because the sun reached its highest point an hour ago.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,920
This is why we have time zones.

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,840
Since the earth rotates once every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,720
But wait, I lied.

36
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,180
It doesn't take 24 hours for the earth to rotate once, it takes 23 hours 56 minutes

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,960
and 4.0916 seconds.

38
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,700
That's because there are really two definitions of a day.

39
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,520
The conventional definition is a solar day—the time between two noons when the sun is highest

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,920
in the sky.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,800
The more scientific definition is a sidereal day.

42
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,360
That's the time it takes for the earth to rotate 360 degrees around its axis and therefore

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,440
the time it takes for the same star to appear in the same spot in the sky from one day to

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
the next.

45
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,520
There's a difference between sidereal days and solar days because the earth rotates both

46
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,120
on its axis and around the sun.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
So watch this.

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,520
Let's put a marker on a spot on the earth and fast forward one sidereal day.

49
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,600
You'll notice that the same spot is not yet the closest point on earth to the sun

50
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,800
because the earth also rotated around the sun.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,960
To bring the marker closest to the sun, we'll need to advance four minutes forward and now

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,140
we're at one solar day.

53
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,240
Those four minutes add up conveniently to just about 24 hours over one year so that

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,080
means that there's one more sidereal day per year than solar day.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,000
Alright, now we can go to Mars.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,140
That was quick.

57
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,800
So Mars is a pretty similar planet to earth and time works in a pretty similar way.

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
It has a prime meridian right here.

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,320
Strangely, astronomers chose this prime meridian before earth was chosen.

60
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,560
Using the mean solar time at the prime meridian, there's a coordinated martian time known

61
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,300
as MTC but, for the most part, any rovers on Mars just set their clocks using the solar

62
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,460
time of their landing site.

63
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,600
This is actually pretty similar to how towns on earth set their time before coordinated

64
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
time zones were created.

65
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,240
Each town on earth set their time based on their own solar noon but this created difficulties

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,140
when rapid transit between places was invented since no one really knew what time it was.

67
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,960
If you want to learn more about this, you can, once again, go check out my other video

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,640
on time.

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Since there have only ever been 11 operational spacecrafts on Mars, having different time

70
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,160
standards based on solar time hasn't yet caused any problems.

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,840
It does mean, however, that even the seconds aren't coordinated between different rovers.

72
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,780
What does cause a bit of a problem though is that a martian day is slightly longer than

73
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,080
an earth day.

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,780
Anyone who's watched the martian knows that a solar day on Mars is called a sol.

75
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,140
One sol is equal to 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.

76
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,080
Rovers on Mars generally only work during the day, partially because some are solar

77
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,080
powered and partially because much of the work is based on observation from cameras

78
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,280
which need light.

79
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,840
Therefore, the teams on earth controlling rovers have to live their lives based on martian

80
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,840
time.

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,560
Their work shift essentially moves forward 40 minutes every day to coordinate with the

82
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,000
time that it's light on Mars.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,460
Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who worked in the Spirit and Opportunity

84
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,000
programs said that,

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're always jet-lagged.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,480
It's only a little bit, because an hour, who cares, that's off so bad.

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,760
But it starts to take a toll.

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,880
Scientists who work on rovers sometimes wear two watches—one for martian time and one

89
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,580
for earth time.

90
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,020
So if we do go colonize Mars, we'll want to create time zones and actually use the

91
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,920
standardized time.

92
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:08,080
Using different time standards at different places always creates problems especially

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,040
for computers and communications.

94
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,860
This, of course, is just one of many details that we'll have to figure out before we

95
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,000
go live on the red planet.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,040
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.

97
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,240
It was far more educational than last week's episode about toilet paper orientation which

98
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,960
you can find right here.
