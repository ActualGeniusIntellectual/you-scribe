00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.360
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.360 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.040
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.040 --> 00:24.280
bit more about our amazing world.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.280
Today we're going to take a trip.

00:26.280 --> 00:29.920
We're going to slip the surly bonds of earth up into the heavens.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.840
We're traveling through the galaxy to learn about timekeeping on the red planet—Mars.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.240
But before we can understand timekeeping on Mars, we first have to understand timekeeping

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240
on earth.

00:41.240 --> 00:42.240
Dammit.

00:42.240 --> 00:47.880
Can we turn this thing around?

00:47.880 --> 00:51.320
Alright so this is the Greenwich Observatory in England.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.320
Greenwich is known for being the site of the prime meridian.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.680
For all intents and purposes, this is the longitudinal center of earth.

00:58.680 --> 01:02.840
For simplicity's sake, we'll say that time is determined based on the sun.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.280
This isn't exactly true though, so I have a whole other video that explains time in

01:06.280 --> 01:07.620
more detail.

01:07.620 --> 01:11.720
When the sun is highest in the sky at any given location, we call that noon and the

01:11.720 --> 01:14.700
rest of the day's time is relative to this.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.820
So now let's go south to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian.

01:18.820 --> 01:21.800
We find ourselves in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.680
Similar to how the prime meridian is the longitudinal center of the earth, the equator

01:25.680 --> 01:28.180
is the latitudinal center of the earth.

01:28.180 --> 01:32.560
At this point of 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude, it's noon because the

01:32.560 --> 01:34.920
sun is at its highest point in the sky.

01:34.920 --> 01:41.120
Great, now if we go 1,035 miles east we find ourselves in the lovely village of Atumbi

01:41.120 --> 01:42.860
in the Republic of the Congo.

01:42.860 --> 01:48.280
In Atumbi, the time is 1 pm because the sun reached its highest point an hour ago.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.920
This is why we have time zones.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.840
Since the earth rotates once every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.720
But wait, I lied.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.180
It doesn't take 24 hours for the earth to rotate once, it takes 23 hours 56 minutes

02:00.180 --> 02:01.960
and 4.0916 seconds.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.700
That's because there are really two definitions of a day.

02:05.700 --> 02:10.520
The conventional definition is a solar day—the time between two noons when the sun is highest

02:10.520 --> 02:11.920
in the sky.

02:11.920 --> 02:14.800
The more scientific definition is a sidereal day.

02:14.840 --> 02:19.360
That's the time it takes for the earth to rotate 360 degrees around its axis and therefore

02:19.360 --> 02:23.440
the time it takes for the same star to appear in the same spot in the sky from one day to

02:23.440 --> 02:24.440
the next.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.520
There's a difference between sidereal days and solar days because the earth rotates both

02:28.520 --> 02:31.120
on its axis and around the sun.

02:31.120 --> 02:32.120
So watch this.

02:32.120 --> 02:36.520
Let's put a marker on a spot on the earth and fast forward one sidereal day.

02:36.520 --> 02:40.600
You'll notice that the same spot is not yet the closest point on earth to the sun

02:40.600 --> 02:43.800
because the earth also rotated around the sun.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.960
To bring the marker closest to the sun, we'll need to advance four minutes forward and now

02:47.960 --> 02:50.140
we're at one solar day.

02:50.140 --> 02:54.240
Those four minutes add up conveniently to just about 24 hours over one year so that

02:54.240 --> 02:58.080
means that there's one more sidereal day per year than solar day.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.000
Alright, now we can go to Mars.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.140
That was quick.

03:02.140 --> 03:06.800
So Mars is a pretty similar planet to earth and time works in a pretty similar way.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.120
It has a prime meridian right here.

03:09.120 --> 03:14.320
Strangely, astronomers chose this prime meridian before earth was chosen.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.560
Using the mean solar time at the prime meridian, there's a coordinated martian time known

03:18.560 --> 03:24.300
as MTC but, for the most part, any rovers on Mars just set their clocks using the solar

03:24.300 --> 03:26.460
time of their landing site.

03:26.460 --> 03:30.600
This is actually pretty similar to how towns on earth set their time before coordinated

03:30.600 --> 03:32.600
time zones were created.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.240
Each town on earth set their time based on their own solar noon but this created difficulties

03:37.240 --> 03:42.140
when rapid transit between places was invented since no one really knew what time it was.

03:42.140 --> 03:45.960
If you want to learn more about this, you can, once again, go check out my other video

03:45.960 --> 03:47.640
on time.

03:47.640 --> 03:51.920
Since there have only ever been 11 operational spacecrafts on Mars, having different time

03:51.920 --> 03:56.160
standards based on solar time hasn't yet caused any problems.

03:56.160 --> 04:00.840
It does mean, however, that even the seconds aren't coordinated between different rovers.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.780
What does cause a bit of a problem though is that a martian day is slightly longer than

04:04.780 --> 04:06.080
an earth day.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.780
Anyone who's watched the martian knows that a solar day on Mars is called a sol.

04:10.780 --> 04:17.140
One sol is equal to 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.

04:17.140 --> 04:21.080
Rovers on Mars generally only work during the day, partially because some are solar

04:21.080 --> 04:25.080
powered and partially because much of the work is based on observation from cameras

04:25.080 --> 04:26.280
which need light.

04:26.280 --> 04:30.840
Therefore, the teams on earth controlling rovers have to live their lives based on martian

04:30.840 --> 04:31.840
time.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.560
Their work shift essentially moves forward 40 minutes every day to coordinate with the

04:35.560 --> 04:38.000
time that it's light on Mars.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.460
Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who worked in the Spirit and Opportunity

04:42.460 --> 04:44.000
programs said that,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
You're always jet-lagged.

04:45.000 --> 04:49.480
It's only a little bit, because an hour, who cares, that's off so bad.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.760
But it starts to take a toll.

04:51.760 --> 04:55.880
Scientists who work on rovers sometimes wear two watches—one for martian time and one

04:55.880 --> 04:57.580
for earth time.

04:57.580 --> 05:02.020
So if we do go colonize Mars, we'll want to create time zones and actually use the

05:02.020 --> 05:03.920
standardized time.

05:03.920 --> 05:08.080
Using different time standards at different places always creates problems especially

05:08.080 --> 05:10.040
for computers and communications.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.860
This, of course, is just one of many details that we'll have to figure out before we

05:14.860 --> 05:19.000
go live on the red planet.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.040
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.

05:21.040 --> 05:25.240
It was far more educational than last week's episode about toilet paper orientation which

05:25.240 --> 05:26.960
you can find right here.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.840

Also, before you go, this is my formal plea for you guys to go follow me on Twitter.

05:34.680 --> 05:39.840
I have 13 followers and while those 13 seem like really cool guys, I would love to have

05:39.840 --> 05:41.720
more people to talk to.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.440
My username is at WendoverPro.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.640
Thanks for watching and come back next week for more of That Wikipedia List.
