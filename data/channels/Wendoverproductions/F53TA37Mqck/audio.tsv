0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13360	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13360	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21040	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21040	24280	bit more about our amazing world.
24280	26280	Today we're going to take a trip.
26280	29920	We're going to slip the surly bonds of earth up into the heavens.
29920	35840	We're traveling through the galaxy to learn about timekeeping on the red planet—Mars.
35840	40240	But before we can understand timekeeping on Mars, we first have to understand timekeeping
40240	41240	on earth.
41240	42240	Dammit.
42240	47880	Can we turn this thing around?
47880	51320	Alright so this is the Greenwich Observatory in England.
51320	54320	Greenwich is known for being the site of the prime meridian.
54320	58680	For all intents and purposes, this is the longitudinal center of earth.
58680	62840	For simplicity's sake, we'll say that time is determined based on the sun.
62840	66280	This isn't exactly true though, so I have a whole other video that explains time in
66280	67620	more detail.
67620	71720	When the sun is highest in the sky at any given location, we call that noon and the
71720	74700	rest of the day's time is relative to this.
74700	78820	So now let's go south to the intersection between the equator and the prime meridian.
78820	81800	We find ourselves in the middle of the Gulf of Guinea.
81800	85680	Similar to how the prime meridian is the longitudinal center of the earth, the equator
85680	88180	is the latitudinal center of the earth.
88180	92560	At this point of 0 degrees longitude and 0 degrees latitude, it's noon because the
92560	94920	sun is at its highest point in the sky.
94920	101120	Great, now if we go 1,035 miles east we find ourselves in the lovely village of Atumbi
101120	102860	in the Republic of the Congo.
102860	108280	In Atumbi, the time is 1 pm because the sun reached its highest point an hour ago.
108280	109920	This is why we have time zones.
109920	113840	Since the earth rotates once every 24 hours, there are 24 time zones.
113840	115720	But wait, I lied.
115720	120180	It doesn't take 24 hours for the earth to rotate once, it takes 23 hours 56 minutes
120180	121960	and 4.0916 seconds.
121960	125700	That's because there are really two definitions of a day.
125700	130520	The conventional definition is a solar day—the time between two noons when the sun is highest
130520	131920	in the sky.
131920	134800	The more scientific definition is a sidereal day.
134840	139360	That's the time it takes for the earth to rotate 360 degrees around its axis and therefore
139360	143440	the time it takes for the same star to appear in the same spot in the sky from one day to
143440	144440	the next.
144440	148520	There's a difference between sidereal days and solar days because the earth rotates both
148520	151120	on its axis and around the sun.
151120	152120	So watch this.
152120	156520	Let's put a marker on a spot on the earth and fast forward one sidereal day.
156520	160600	You'll notice that the same spot is not yet the closest point on earth to the sun
160600	163800	because the earth also rotated around the sun.
163800	167960	To bring the marker closest to the sun, we'll need to advance four minutes forward and now
167960	170140	we're at one solar day.
170140	174240	Those four minutes add up conveniently to just about 24 hours over one year so that
174240	178080	means that there's one more sidereal day per year than solar day.
178080	181000	Alright, now we can go to Mars.
181000	182140	That was quick.
182140	186800	So Mars is a pretty similar planet to earth and time works in a pretty similar way.
186800	189120	It has a prime meridian right here.
189120	194320	Strangely, astronomers chose this prime meridian before earth was chosen.
194320	198560	Using the mean solar time at the prime meridian, there's a coordinated martian time known
198560	204300	as MTC but, for the most part, any rovers on Mars just set their clocks using the solar
204300	206460	time of their landing site.
206460	210600	This is actually pretty similar to how towns on earth set their time before coordinated
210600	212600	time zones were created.
212600	217240	Each town on earth set their time based on their own solar noon but this created difficulties
217240	222140	when rapid transit between places was invented since no one really knew what time it was.
222140	225960	If you want to learn more about this, you can, once again, go check out my other video
225960	227640	on time.
227640	231920	Since there have only ever been 11 operational spacecrafts on Mars, having different time
231920	236160	standards based on solar time hasn't yet caused any problems.
236160	240840	It does mean, however, that even the seconds aren't coordinated between different rovers.
240840	244780	What does cause a bit of a problem though is that a martian day is slightly longer than
244780	246080	an earth day.
246080	250780	Anyone who's watched the martian knows that a solar day on Mars is called a sol.
250780	257140	One sol is equal to 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds.
257140	261080	Rovers on Mars generally only work during the day, partially because some are solar
261080	265080	powered and partially because much of the work is based on observation from cameras
265080	266280	which need light.
266280	270840	Therefore, the teams on earth controlling rovers have to live their lives based on martian
270840	271840	time.
271840	275560	Their work shift essentially moves forward 40 minutes every day to coordinate with the
275560	278000	time that it's light on Mars.
278000	282460	Deborah Bass, a scientist from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory who worked in the Spirit and Opportunity
282460	284000	programs said that,
284000	285000	You're always jet-lagged.
285000	289480	It's only a little bit, because an hour, who cares, that's off so bad.
289480	291760	But it starts to take a toll.
291760	295880	Scientists who work on rovers sometimes wear two watches—one for martian time and one
295880	297580	for earth time.
297580	302020	So if we do go colonize Mars, we'll want to create time zones and actually use the
302020	303920	standardized time.
303920	308080	Using different time standards at different places always creates problems especially
308080	310040	for computers and communications.
310040	314860	This, of course, is just one of many details that we'll have to figure out before we
314860	319000	go live on the red planet.
319000	321040	I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.
321040	325240	It was far more educational than last week's episode about toilet paper orientation which
325240	326960	you can find right here.

329840	334680	Also, before you go, this is my formal plea for you guys to go follow me on Twitter.
334680	339840	I have 13 followers and while those 13 seem like really cool guys, I would love to have
339840	341720	more people to talk to.
341720	344440	My username is at WendoverPro.
344440	348640	Thanks for watching and come back next week for more of That Wikipedia List.
