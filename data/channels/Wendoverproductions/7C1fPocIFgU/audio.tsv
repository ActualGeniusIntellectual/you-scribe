10240	13800	The economic system is a solution to scarcity.
13800	18120	In fact, money, as a system, is a solution to scarcity.
18120	23040	Fundamentally, the world does not have enough of what people want so we've created this
23040	25420	system to allocate things.
25420	30380	If everyone in the world were offered a pineapple, free of charge, nearly everyone would probably
30380	32220	take that pineapple.
32220	36480	If everyone in the world were offered any resource, in fact, they would probably take
36480	38120	that resource.
38120	44060	The problem is, the world doesn't have enough pineapples—there's a limited supply.
44060	48660	There aren't enough pineapples for everyone, so the market economy, at least in theory,
48660	53740	matches them to those that want the most—those that will give up enough money to get that
53740	55000	pineapple.
55000	59980	Simultaneously, though, this system motivates people to produce more of what is scarce since
59980	60980	they get paid.
60980	66780	At a fundamental level, whenever something needs to be allocated, it is monetized.
66780	70140	This system does, however, have its flaws.
70140	74300	How much someone is willing to pay isn't perfectly correlated to how much they need
74300	75940	or want a thing.
75940	80940	In the purest form of this system, every participant would have the same amount of money and the
80940	85720	same ability to pay so that what they would offer for a scarce resource would perfectly
85720	90860	correlate to how much they want it, but that, of course, is not the case.
90860	97320	In the real world, some people have more money than others, and so this system breaks down.
97320	101800	One poor person might really want a pineapple and offer a full percent of their money to
101800	106880	get it, but a rich person with eleven times the money might sort of want a pineapple and
106880	111780	offer one tenth of a percent of their money to get it, and they will get the pineapple.
111780	116380	In this circumstance, the market system breaks down as the person who wanted the pineapple
116380	118580	less has received it.
118580	121700	The overall social good is not maximized.
121700	126820	Collectively, though, we have decided that perfect is the enemy of good and that a certain
126820	131660	level of inequality is okay, especially as, according to some, it motivates people to
131660	133580	create more value.
133640	138760	Now, inequality in the pineapple market is somewhat unfortunate, but ultimately not a
138760	140220	huge deal.
140220	145240	In other markets, though, human ethics have decided that a monetized market system, with
145240	149980	that one fundamental flaw of inequality, would be wrong.
149980	154880	When the allocation of a scarce resource means the difference between life or death, when
154880	161040	whether a person gets something is that important, a market system's inequality is perpetuated
161040	165480	because people's willingness to pay is infinite, it's not proportional to how much
165480	171660	they need or want a thing, and therefore, it will always go to who has more money.
171660	174180	That is the issue with organs.
174180	179500	In this case, allocation needs to happen a different way.
179500	185840	Every nine minutes in the US, a doctor makes a life-changing conclusion about their patient.
185840	190100	They determine that that individual and their condition has progressed to the point that
190160	193680	they will not survive without an organ transplant.
193680	198200	As soon as that happens, the individual is placed into a nationwide system that works
198200	203640	to balance societal utility and human ethics to match organs to those that need and deserve
203640	205200	them most.
205200	210760	The core of all issues related to organ transplantation is the fact that there are more people waiting
210760	213840	for transplants than there are organs available.
213840	218560	Just like pineapples, iPhones, or anything in the traditional economy, there are less
218580	222440	of it than people want of it if the cost was zero.
222440	230720	In the US, 112,000 people are on those lists whereas only 39,718 transplants were actually
230720	233140	performed in 2019.
233140	237360	This means that patients often have to wait years for a new organ.
237360	242320	The exact time, though, varies dramatically depending on a number of factors.
242320	246260	Patients with the most severe and urgent form of liver failure, for example, only have to
246260	251100	wait a median of six days, whereas a patient at a lower priority for a heart transplant
251100	254460	would wait a median of 726 days.
254460	259820	Now, when every name on that list is quite literally on the precipice between life and
259820	263220	death, fairness is tough.
263220	267160	Each country's transplant list works slightly differently, but most work fairly similarly
267160	268540	to the US's.
268540	273520	There, much of an individual's position on the list is based on how much use they're
273520	275300	going to get from the organ.
275340	280200	Kidneys, for example, are the most commonly transplanted organ out there and in the US,
280200	285340	the major determinant for those on the waiting list is their estimated post-transplant survival
285340	286340	score.
286340	290080	Essentially, one wants to give an organ to an individual for which it will provide the
290080	293120	most additional years to their life.
293120	297740	For example, a 30-year-old who has not had dialysis, does not have diabetes, and has
297740	303480	never had an organ transplant before would have an EPTS score of 2%, one of the highest,
303480	307920	meaning their chances of surviving 10 years post-transplant are above 90%.
307920	312500	Therefore, they would be at the top of the list, eligible to receive a kidney from the
312500	317360	highest quality tranche, expected to function better than most other donor kidneys.
317360	323400	Meanwhile, a 70-year-old who is on dialysis and has type 1 diabetes would gain an EPTS
323400	328760	score of 89%, meaning their 10-year survival outlook is less than 50%.
329280	335240	Therefore, they would only be offered a transplant after all matches with a greater outlook are.
335240	340400	Within these tranches, based on the EPTS score, further ranking is done based on other scores
340400	341720	and waiting times.
341720	348120	Now, the list itself is certainly not just thousands of names, ranked from 1 to 90,000,
348120	350480	waiting their turn for the next available organ.
350480	355800	It's an incredibly complex system, mixing factors including geography, compatibility,
355800	357760	necessity, and more.
357760	362440	Kidneys themselves are unique among organs in that the human body has two and, for the
362440	365360	most part, individuals only need one.
365360	370440	Therefore, an individual can donate one of theirs and be at only a very slight increased
370440	374280	risk of kidney failure or other complications long-term.
374280	379440	That is the living donor route, but the vast majority of kidneys still come from deceased
379440	380440	donors.
380440	386000	However, while 54% of Americans are registered as organ donors, individuals have to die in
386000	390480	a very specific way in order for their organs to be eligible for donation.
390480	394420	They typically have to either have a terminal condition where they are removed from life
394420	398800	support in a controlled manner, or suffer from brain death where the organs continue
398800	401900	functioning while all brain function has ceased.
401900	406760	This specificity of mortality contributes to the scarcity of organs since, even after
406760	412080	one of the scenarios happens, one has to consider the compatibility, health, and eligibility
412080	414120	of the donor organs.
414120	419440	It also means that the best organs—those from young, healthy donors—are even rarer
419440	423400	since they are less likely to die in such a controlled manner.
423400	430720	So, this system of allocation through a non-monetary system is designed to appeal to human ethics—designed
430720	438060	to work to match kidneys based on need, not ability to pay—but it too has its flaws.
438060	441780	The root cause of this is around the way the surgery works.
441780	447940	Kidneys can only survive outside the body for 24 to 36 hours without significant deterioration,
447940	452220	so once one becomes available, surgery has to happen fast.
452220	457520	Therefore, for the purpose of matching, the US is split up into 11 regions, and these
457520	460740	regions certainly aren't all created equal.
460740	466260	For example, region 3, comprised of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,
466260	473100	and Florida, donated 4,055 kidneys in 2019, whereas region 9, comprised of New York State
473100	478800	and Western Vermont, only donated 1,564 in the same year.
478800	483920	Now, the root cause behind this disparity is fairly obvious.
483920	488200	The states that make up region 3 are part of what's known as the stroke belt.
488200	493080	That's because the population of this region is far more likely to suffer from a stroke
493080	495160	than the national average.
495160	499980	This are a potential cause of death quite conducive to organ donation as they can often
499980	501820	lead to brain death.
501820	507300	Now, organs donated in a given region are first offered to those listed in that region—after
507300	511900	all, the recipients need to arrive at the hospital in a matter of hours.
511900	517380	Therefore, as region 3 has more organs available, the median waiting time for a kidney, and
517380	522100	many other organ types, is far shorter here than in region 9.
522120	527320	Interestingly, the rules in the US do allow those that need a transplant to list themselves
527320	531840	in multiple regions, as long as they follow all the other rules the same as someone living
531840	533540	in that region.
533540	537160	That means that they still need to go through all the testing ahead of time at the local
537160	541480	hospital, and they need to report to that hospital in time once they get the call that
541480	543400	an organ is available.
543400	548960	When Steve Jobs received a liver transplant in 2009, for example, he did so in Memphis,
548960	552100	Tennessee, far from where he lived in California.
552100	556220	Tennessee is also considered as part of the stroke belt, and therefore the transplant
556220	560240	region it is in, 11, has shorter wait times.
560240	564340	Of course, wealthier people, such as Steve Jobs, are able to do things like fly in a
564340	569140	private jet to get to the transplant hospital in time, and he even bought a house in Memphis
569140	571180	to stay during his recovery.
571180	576180	It's no wonder why there is such a strong positive correlation between patients listing
576180	579340	in multiple regions and income levels.
579340	583920	This system certainly perpetuates inequality, but the alternative is that a patient in New
583920	588120	York is punished for the fact that their region is healthier.
588120	595520	So, overall, the organ transplant system does not solve inequality, but only reduces it.
595520	600820	Simultaneously, though, it does not have a mechanism to solve the issue of scarcity.
600820	605580	The traditional market economy solves scarcity by paying people more money for what is in
605580	611220	high demand, therefore, in theory, bringing things to an equilibrium, but this system
611220	615100	has no way to increase supply when demand is higher.
615100	621380	So, the current system is not perfectly ethical, and it also potentially exacerbates the shortage,
621380	627100	so that has led some people to ask, what if we just used a normal economic market for
627100	629500	organ allocation?
629500	632060	That is what happened in Iran.
632060	636480	Previously, the waiting list for kidneys in the country exceeded that of almost any
636480	641900	other nation due to political instability and cultural stigma against organ donation.
641900	647980	However, in 1988, they implemented a system where recipients could pay donors for their
647980	648980	organs.
648980	654780	Typically, a donor receives a fee of around $4,500, equivalent to more than half a year's
654780	658540	salary, in addition to free health insurance for a year.
658540	664100	Now, this isn't a truly free market—it is highly regulated and managed—but reports
664100	668580	indicate that it has had some success at solving the scarcity problem.
668580	674300	In the years after this program was implemented, organ donations skyrocketed and, apparently,
674300	678160	there is no longer any waiting list in the country.
678160	683100	That is quite a success compared to a country like the US, where thousands die each year
683100	688820	waiting on a transplant, but opponents argue that the negatives are just too severe.
688820	693140	When you commoditize organs, and especially kidneys, where humans can donate one and live
693140	697300	using the other, you incentivize desperate individuals to sell theirs.
697300	702300	Meanwhile, you make it even harder for poorer individuals to receive an organ transplant,
702300	704420	as they can be priced out.
704420	711400	Overall, an open organ market increases inequality, but also increases the number of transplants.
711400	718200	In the end, that means there are two basic choices—saving more lives, but in an unequal,
718200	724260	unfair manner, or saving fewer lives, but assuring a greater sense of fairness.
724260	728960	Most countries have decided that the second option is better—they are potentially dooming
728960	733480	some to die in the mission of assuring that what determines what gets you an organ is
733480	738120	how much you need it, not how much you can pay for it—but there is increasing pressure
738120	742680	in many places to stimulate supply with compensation.
742680	748680	This is a situation where no solution is perfect—you can't have a perfectly abundant supply and
748680	753640	you can't have a perfectly fair system, but you can get close to fair or close to
753640	755800	abundance.
755800	760460	Inequality is just part of a monetized system, so even though economics is an incredibly
760460	765760	powerful tool for allocation, it must be used carefully in the cases where the stakes are
765760	769400	truly life and death.
