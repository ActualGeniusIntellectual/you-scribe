4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,800
The economic system is a solution to scarcity.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,120
In fact, money, as a system, is a solution to scarcity.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,040
Fundamentally, the world does not have enough of what people want so we've created this

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,420
system to allocate things.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,380
If everyone in the world were offered a pineapple, free of charge, nearly everyone would probably

9
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,220
take that pineapple.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,480
If everyone in the world were offered any resource, in fact, they would probably take

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,120
that resource.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,060
The problem is, the world doesn't have enough pineapples—there's a limited supply.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,660
There aren't enough pineapples for everyone, so the market economy, at least in theory,

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,740
matches them to those that want the most—those that will give up enough money to get that

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,000
pineapple.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,980
Simultaneously, though, this system motivates people to produce more of what is scarce since

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,980
they get paid.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,780
At a fundamental level, whenever something needs to be allocated, it is monetized.

19
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,140
This system does, however, have its flaws.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,300
How much someone is willing to pay isn't perfectly correlated to how much they need

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,940
or want a thing.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,940
In the purest form of this system, every participant would have the same amount of money and the

23
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,720
same ability to pay so that what they would offer for a scarce resource would perfectly

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,860
correlate to how much they want it, but that, of course, is not the case.

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,320
In the real world, some people have more money than others, and so this system breaks down.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,800
One poor person might really want a pineapple and offer a full percent of their money to

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,880
get it, but a rich person with eleven times the money might sort of want a pineapple and

28
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,780
offer one tenth of a percent of their money to get it, and they will get the pineapple.

29
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,380
In this circumstance, the market system breaks down as the person who wanted the pineapple

30
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,580
less has received it.

31
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,700
The overall social good is not maximized.

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,820
Collectively, though, we have decided that perfect is the enemy of good and that a certain

33
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,660
level of inequality is okay, especially as, according to some, it motivates people to

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,580
create more value.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,760
Now, inequality in the pineapple market is somewhat unfortunate, but ultimately not a

36
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,220
huge deal.

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,240
In other markets, though, human ethics have decided that a monetized market system, with

38
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,980
that one fundamental flaw of inequality, would be wrong.

39
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,880
When the allocation of a scarce resource means the difference between life or death, when

40
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,040
whether a person gets something is that important, a market system's inequality is perpetuated

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,480
because people's willingness to pay is infinite, it's not proportional to how much

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,660
they need or want a thing, and therefore, it will always go to who has more money.

43
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,180
That is the issue with organs.

44
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,500
In this case, allocation needs to happen a different way.

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,840
Every nine minutes in the US, a doctor makes a life-changing conclusion about their patient.

46
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,100
They determine that that individual and their condition has progressed to the point that

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,680
they will not survive without an organ transplant.

48
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,200
As soon as that happens, the individual is placed into a nationwide system that works

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,640
to balance societal utility and human ethics to match organs to those that need and deserve

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,200
them most.

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,760
The core of all issues related to organ transplantation is the fact that there are more people waiting

52
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,840
for transplants than there are organs available.

53
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,560
Just like pineapples, iPhones, or anything in the traditional economy, there are less

54
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,440
of it than people want of it if the cost was zero.

55
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,720
In the US, 112,000 people are on those lists whereas only 39,718 transplants were actually

56
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,140
performed in 2019.

57
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,360
This means that patients often have to wait years for a new organ.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,320
The exact time, though, varies dramatically depending on a number of factors.

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,260
Patients with the most severe and urgent form of liver failure, for example, only have to

60
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,100
wait a median of six days, whereas a patient at a lower priority for a heart transplant

61
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,460
would wait a median of 726 days.

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,820
Now, when every name on that list is quite literally on the precipice between life and

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,220
death, fairness is tough.

64
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,160
Each country's transplant list works slightly differently, but most work fairly similarly

65
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,540
to the US's.

66
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,520
There, much of an individual's position on the list is based on how much use they're

67
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,300
going to get from the organ.

68
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,200
Kidneys, for example, are the most commonly transplanted organ out there and in the US,

69
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,340
the major determinant for those on the waiting list is their estimated post-transplant survival

70
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
score.

71
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,080
Essentially, one wants to give an organ to an individual for which it will provide the

72
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,120
most additional years to their life.

73
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,740
For example, a 30-year-old who has not had dialysis, does not have diabetes, and has

74
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,480
never had an organ transplant before would have an EPTS score of 2%, one of the highest,

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,920
meaning their chances of surviving 10 years post-transplant are above 90%.

76
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,500
Therefore, they would be at the top of the list, eligible to receive a kidney from the

77
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,360
highest quality tranche, expected to function better than most other donor kidneys.

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,400
Meanwhile, a 70-year-old who is on dialysis and has type 1 diabetes would gain an EPTS

79
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:28,760
score of 89%, meaning their 10-year survival outlook is less than 50%.

80
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,240
Therefore, they would only be offered a transplant after all matches with a greater outlook are.

81
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,400
Within these tranches, based on the EPTS score, further ranking is done based on other scores

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,720
and waiting times.

83
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,120
Now, the list itself is certainly not just thousands of names, ranked from 1 to 90,000,

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,480
waiting their turn for the next available organ.

85
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:55,800
It's an incredibly complex system, mixing factors including geography, compatibility,

86
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,760
necessity, and more.

87
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,440
Kidneys themselves are unique among organs in that the human body has two and, for the

88
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,360
most part, individuals only need one.

89
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,440
Therefore, an individual can donate one of theirs and be at only a very slight increased

90
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,280
risk of kidney failure or other complications long-term.

91
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,440
That is the living donor route, but the vast majority of kidneys still come from deceased

92
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
donors.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,000
However, while 54% of Americans are registered as organ donors, individuals have to die in

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,480
a very specific way in order for their organs to be eligible for donation.

95
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,420
They typically have to either have a terminal condition where they are removed from life

96
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,800
support in a controlled manner, or suffer from brain death where the organs continue

97
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,900
functioning while all brain function has ceased.

98
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,760
This specificity of mortality contributes to the scarcity of organs since, even after

99
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:52,080
one of the scenarios happens, one has to consider the compatibility, health, and eligibility

100
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
of the donor organs.

101
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,440
It also means that the best organs—those from young, healthy donors—are even rarer

102
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,400
since they are less likely to die in such a controlled manner.

103
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,720
So, this system of allocation through a non-monetary system is designed to appeal to human ethics—designed

104
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,060
to work to match kidneys based on need, not ability to pay—but it too has its flaws.

105
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,780
The root cause of this is around the way the surgery works.

106
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,940
Kidneys can only survive outside the body for 24 to 36 hours without significant deterioration,

107
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,220
so once one becomes available, surgery has to happen fast.

108
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,520
Therefore, for the purpose of matching, the US is split up into 11 regions, and these

109
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,740
regions certainly aren't all created equal.

110
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,260
For example, region 3, comprised of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,

111
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,100
and Florida, donated 4,055 kidneys in 2019, whereas region 9, comprised of New York State

112
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,800
and Western Vermont, only donated 1,564 in the same year.

113
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,920
Now, the root cause behind this disparity is fairly obvious.

114
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,200
The states that make up region 3 are part of what's known as the stroke belt.

115
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,080
That's because the population of this region is far more likely to suffer from a stroke

116
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,160
than the national average.

117
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,980
This are a potential cause of death quite conducive to organ donation as they can often

118
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,820
lead to brain death.

119
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:27,300
Now, organs donated in a given region are first offered to those listed in that region—after

120
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,900
all, the recipients need to arrive at the hospital in a matter of hours.

121
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,380
Therefore, as region 3 has more organs available, the median waiting time for a kidney, and

122
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,100
many other organ types, is far shorter here than in region 9.

123
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,320
Interestingly, the rules in the US do allow those that need a transplant to list themselves

124
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,840
in multiple regions, as long as they follow all the other rules the same as someone living

125
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,540
in that region.

126
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,160
That means that they still need to go through all the testing ahead of time at the local

127
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,480
hospital, and they need to report to that hospital in time once they get the call that

128
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,400
an organ is available.

129
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,960
When Steve Jobs received a liver transplant in 2009, for example, he did so in Memphis,

130
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,100
Tennessee, far from where he lived in California.

131
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,220
Tennessee is also considered as part of the stroke belt, and therefore the transplant

132
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,240
region it is in, 11, has shorter wait times.

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,340
Of course, wealthier people, such as Steve Jobs, are able to do things like fly in a

134
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:29,140
private jet to get to the transplant hospital in time, and he even bought a house in Memphis

135
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,180
to stay during his recovery.

136
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:36,180
It's no wonder why there is such a strong positive correlation between patients listing

137
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,340
in multiple regions and income levels.

138
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,920
This system certainly perpetuates inequality, but the alternative is that a patient in New

139
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,120
York is punished for the fact that their region is healthier.

140
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,520
So, overall, the organ transplant system does not solve inequality, but only reduces it.

141
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,820
Simultaneously, though, it does not have a mechanism to solve the issue of scarcity.

142
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,580
The traditional market economy solves scarcity by paying people more money for what is in

143
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,220
high demand, therefore, in theory, bringing things to an equilibrium, but this system

144
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,100
has no way to increase supply when demand is higher.

145
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:21,380
So, the current system is not perfectly ethical, and it also potentially exacerbates the shortage,

146
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,100
so that has led some people to ask, what if we just used a normal economic market for

147
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,500
organ allocation?

148
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,060
That is what happened in Iran.

149
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,480
Previously, the waiting list for kidneys in the country exceeded that of almost any

150
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,900
other nation due to political instability and cultural stigma against organ donation.

151
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,980
However, in 1988, they implemented a system where recipients could pay donors for their

152
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
organs.

153
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,780
Typically, a donor receives a fee of around $4,500, equivalent to more than half a year's

154
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,540
salary, in addition to free health insurance for a year.

155
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,100
Now, this isn't a truly free market—it is highly regulated and managed—but reports

156
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,580
indicate that it has had some success at solving the scarcity problem.

157
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,300
In the years after this program was implemented, organ donations skyrocketed and, apparently,

158
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,160
there is no longer any waiting list in the country.

159
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,100
That is quite a success compared to a country like the US, where thousands die each year

160
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,820
waiting on a transplant, but opponents argue that the negatives are just too severe.

161
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,140
When you commoditize organs, and especially kidneys, where humans can donate one and live

162
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:37,300
using the other, you incentivize desperate individuals to sell theirs.

163
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Meanwhile, you make it even harder for poorer individuals to receive an organ transplant,

164
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,420
as they can be priced out.

165
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,400
Overall, an open organ market increases inequality, but also increases the number of transplants.

166
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,200
In the end, that means there are two basic choices—saving more lives, but in an unequal,

167
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:04,260
unfair manner, or saving fewer lives, but assuring a greater sense of fairness.

168
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,960
Most countries have decided that the second option is better—they are potentially dooming

169
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,480
some to die in the mission of assuring that what determines what gets you an organ is

170
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,120
how much you need it, not how much you can pay for it—but there is increasing pressure

171
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,680
in many places to stimulate supply with compensation.

172
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,680
This is a situation where no solution is perfect—you can't have a perfectly abundant supply and

173
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,640
you can't have a perfectly fair system, but you can get close to fair or close to

174
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,800
abundance.

175
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,460
Inequality is just part of a monetized system, so even though economics is an incredibly

176
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,760
powerful tool for allocation, it must be used carefully in the cases where the stakes are

177
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,400
truly life and death.

178
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,800
Normally, gaining new skills requires quite a lot of commitment, both in time and money,

179
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,560
but Skillshare breaks those barriers down.

180
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,360
You can learn in short sessions online, making far more possible.

181
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,280
What you can learn there ranges from classes on filmmaking at home all the way to how to

182
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,160
use Evernote to boost your productivity.

183
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,320
They really make sure that their portfolio of thousands of high-quality classes allow

184
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:18,120
someone to both become super experienced in one thing, or fairly experienced in a lot

185
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
of things.

186
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,320
You can become an expert, or a generalist, depending on what you prefer.

187
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,940
For those of you wanting to get into YouTube, I'd especially recommend Polymatter's

188
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,660
classes on making animated YouTube videos and making great YouTube thumbnails.

189
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,840
All around, Skillshare just makes so much possible, meaning all you have to do is get

190
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:41,520
started, and you can do that for free for two months by being one of the first 1,000

191
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,400
subscribers to sign up at skl.sh slash wendover 0820.
