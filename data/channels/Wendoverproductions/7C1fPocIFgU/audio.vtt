00:10.240 --> 00:13.800
The economic system is a solution to scarcity.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.120
In fact, money, as a system, is a solution to scarcity.

00:18.120 --> 00:23.040
Fundamentally, the world does not have enough of what people want so we've created this

00:23.040 --> 00:25.420
system to allocate things.

00:25.420 --> 00:30.380
If everyone in the world were offered a pineapple, free of charge, nearly everyone would probably

00:30.380 --> 00:32.220
take that pineapple.

00:32.220 --> 00:36.480
If everyone in the world were offered any resource, in fact, they would probably take

00:36.480 --> 00:38.120
that resource.

00:38.120 --> 00:44.060
The problem is, the world doesn't have enough pineapples—there's a limited supply.

00:44.060 --> 00:48.660
There aren't enough pineapples for everyone, so the market economy, at least in theory,

00:48.660 --> 00:53.740
matches them to those that want the most—those that will give up enough money to get that

00:53.740 --> 00:55.000
pineapple.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.980
Simultaneously, though, this system motivates people to produce more of what is scarce since

00:59.980 --> 01:00.980
they get paid.

01:00.980 --> 01:06.780
At a fundamental level, whenever something needs to be allocated, it is monetized.

01:06.780 --> 01:10.140
This system does, however, have its flaws.

01:10.140 --> 01:14.300
How much someone is willing to pay isn't perfectly correlated to how much they need

01:14.300 --> 01:15.940
or want a thing.

01:15.940 --> 01:20.940
In the purest form of this system, every participant would have the same amount of money and the

01:20.940 --> 01:25.720
same ability to pay so that what they would offer for a scarce resource would perfectly

01:25.720 --> 01:30.860
correlate to how much they want it, but that, of course, is not the case.

01:30.860 --> 01:37.320
In the real world, some people have more money than others, and so this system breaks down.

01:37.320 --> 01:41.800
One poor person might really want a pineapple and offer a full percent of their money to

01:41.800 --> 01:46.880
get it, but a rich person with eleven times the money might sort of want a pineapple and

01:46.880 --> 01:51.780
offer one tenth of a percent of their money to get it, and they will get the pineapple.

01:51.780 --> 01:56.380
In this circumstance, the market system breaks down as the person who wanted the pineapple

01:56.380 --> 01:58.580
less has received it.

01:58.580 --> 02:01.700
The overall social good is not maximized.

02:01.700 --> 02:06.820
Collectively, though, we have decided that perfect is the enemy of good and that a certain

02:06.820 --> 02:11.660
level of inequality is okay, especially as, according to some, it motivates people to

02:11.660 --> 02:13.580
create more value.

02:13.640 --> 02:18.760
Now, inequality in the pineapple market is somewhat unfortunate, but ultimately not a

02:18.760 --> 02:20.220
huge deal.

02:20.220 --> 02:25.240
In other markets, though, human ethics have decided that a monetized market system, with

02:25.240 --> 02:29.980
that one fundamental flaw of inequality, would be wrong.

02:29.980 --> 02:34.880
When the allocation of a scarce resource means the difference between life or death, when

02:34.880 --> 02:41.040
whether a person gets something is that important, a market system's inequality is perpetuated

02:41.040 --> 02:45.480
because people's willingness to pay is infinite, it's not proportional to how much

02:45.480 --> 02:51.660
they need or want a thing, and therefore, it will always go to who has more money.

02:51.660 --> 02:54.180
That is the issue with organs.

02:54.180 --> 02:59.500
In this case, allocation needs to happen a different way.

02:59.500 --> 03:05.840
Every nine minutes in the US, a doctor makes a life-changing conclusion about their patient.

03:05.840 --> 03:10.100
They determine that that individual and their condition has progressed to the point that

03:10.160 --> 03:13.680
they will not survive without an organ transplant.

03:13.680 --> 03:18.200
As soon as that happens, the individual is placed into a nationwide system that works

03:18.200 --> 03:23.640
to balance societal utility and human ethics to match organs to those that need and deserve

03:23.640 --> 03:25.200
them most.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.760
The core of all issues related to organ transplantation is the fact that there are more people waiting

03:30.760 --> 03:33.840
for transplants than there are organs available.

03:33.840 --> 03:38.560
Just like pineapples, iPhones, or anything in the traditional economy, there are less

03:38.580 --> 03:42.440
of it than people want of it if the cost was zero.

03:42.440 --> 03:50.720
In the US, 112,000 people are on those lists whereas only 39,718 transplants were actually

03:50.720 --> 03:53.140
performed in 2019.

03:53.140 --> 03:57.360
This means that patients often have to wait years for a new organ.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.320
The exact time, though, varies dramatically depending on a number of factors.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.260
Patients with the most severe and urgent form of liver failure, for example, only have to

04:06.260 --> 04:11.100
wait a median of six days, whereas a patient at a lower priority for a heart transplant

04:11.100 --> 04:14.460
would wait a median of 726 days.

04:14.460 --> 04:19.820
Now, when every name on that list is quite literally on the precipice between life and

04:19.820 --> 04:23.220
death, fairness is tough.

04:23.220 --> 04:27.160
Each country's transplant list works slightly differently, but most work fairly similarly

04:27.160 --> 04:28.540
to the US's.

04:28.540 --> 04:33.520
There, much of an individual's position on the list is based on how much use they're

04:33.520 --> 04:35.300
going to get from the organ.

04:35.340 --> 04:40.200
Kidneys, for example, are the most commonly transplanted organ out there and in the US,

04:40.200 --> 04:45.340
the major determinant for those on the waiting list is their estimated post-transplant survival

04:45.340 --> 04:46.340
score.

04:46.340 --> 04:50.080
Essentially, one wants to give an organ to an individual for which it will provide the

04:50.080 --> 04:53.120
most additional years to their life.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.740
For example, a 30-year-old who has not had dialysis, does not have diabetes, and has

04:57.740 --> 05:03.480
never had an organ transplant before would have an EPTS score of 2%, one of the highest,

05:03.480 --> 05:07.920
meaning their chances of surviving 10 years post-transplant are above 90%.

05:07.920 --> 05:12.500
Therefore, they would be at the top of the list, eligible to receive a kidney from the

05:12.500 --> 05:17.360
highest quality tranche, expected to function better than most other donor kidneys.

05:17.360 --> 05:23.400
Meanwhile, a 70-year-old who is on dialysis and has type 1 diabetes would gain an EPTS

05:23.400 --> 05:28.760
score of 89%, meaning their 10-year survival outlook is less than 50%.

05:29.280 --> 05:35.240
Therefore, they would only be offered a transplant after all matches with a greater outlook are.

05:35.240 --> 05:40.400
Within these tranches, based on the EPTS score, further ranking is done based on other scores

05:40.400 --> 05:41.720
and waiting times.

05:41.720 --> 05:48.120
Now, the list itself is certainly not just thousands of names, ranked from 1 to 90,000,

05:48.120 --> 05:50.480
waiting their turn for the next available organ.

05:50.480 --> 05:55.800
It's an incredibly complex system, mixing factors including geography, compatibility,

05:55.800 --> 05:57.760
necessity, and more.

05:57.760 --> 06:02.440
Kidneys themselves are unique among organs in that the human body has two and, for the

06:02.440 --> 06:05.360
most part, individuals only need one.

06:05.360 --> 06:10.440
Therefore, an individual can donate one of theirs and be at only a very slight increased

06:10.440 --> 06:14.280
risk of kidney failure or other complications long-term.

06:14.280 --> 06:19.440
That is the living donor route, but the vast majority of kidneys still come from deceased

06:19.440 --> 06:20.440
donors.

06:20.440 --> 06:26.000
However, while 54% of Americans are registered as organ donors, individuals have to die in

06:26.000 --> 06:30.480
a very specific way in order for their organs to be eligible for donation.

06:30.480 --> 06:34.420
They typically have to either have a terminal condition where they are removed from life

06:34.420 --> 06:38.800
support in a controlled manner, or suffer from brain death where the organs continue

06:38.800 --> 06:41.900
functioning while all brain function has ceased.

06:41.900 --> 06:46.760
This specificity of mortality contributes to the scarcity of organs since, even after

06:46.760 --> 06:52.080
one of the scenarios happens, one has to consider the compatibility, health, and eligibility

06:52.080 --> 06:54.120
of the donor organs.

06:54.120 --> 06:59.440
It also means that the best organs—those from young, healthy donors—are even rarer

06:59.440 --> 07:03.400
since they are less likely to die in such a controlled manner.

07:03.400 --> 07:10.720
So, this system of allocation through a non-monetary system is designed to appeal to human ethics—designed

07:10.720 --> 07:18.060
to work to match kidneys based on need, not ability to pay—but it too has its flaws.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.780
The root cause of this is around the way the surgery works.

07:21.780 --> 07:27.940
Kidneys can only survive outside the body for 24 to 36 hours without significant deterioration,

07:27.940 --> 07:32.220
so once one becomes available, surgery has to happen fast.

07:32.220 --> 07:37.520
Therefore, for the purpose of matching, the US is split up into 11 regions, and these

07:37.520 --> 07:40.740
regions certainly aren't all created equal.

07:40.740 --> 07:46.260
For example, region 3, comprised of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia,

07:46.260 --> 07:53.100
and Florida, donated 4,055 kidneys in 2019, whereas region 9, comprised of New York State

07:53.100 --> 07:58.800
and Western Vermont, only donated 1,564 in the same year.

07:58.800 --> 08:03.920
Now, the root cause behind this disparity is fairly obvious.

08:03.920 --> 08:08.200
The states that make up region 3 are part of what's known as the stroke belt.

08:08.200 --> 08:13.080
That's because the population of this region is far more likely to suffer from a stroke

08:13.080 --> 08:15.160
than the national average.

08:15.160 --> 08:19.980
This are a potential cause of death quite conducive to organ donation as they can often

08:19.980 --> 08:21.820
lead to brain death.

08:21.820 --> 08:27.300
Now, organs donated in a given region are first offered to those listed in that region—after

08:27.300 --> 08:31.900
all, the recipients need to arrive at the hospital in a matter of hours.

08:31.900 --> 08:37.380
Therefore, as region 3 has more organs available, the median waiting time for a kidney, and

08:37.380 --> 08:42.100
many other organ types, is far shorter here than in region 9.

08:42.120 --> 08:47.320
Interestingly, the rules in the US do allow those that need a transplant to list themselves

08:47.320 --> 08:51.840
in multiple regions, as long as they follow all the other rules the same as someone living

08:51.840 --> 08:53.540
in that region.

08:53.540 --> 08:57.160
That means that they still need to go through all the testing ahead of time at the local

08:57.160 --> 09:01.480
hospital, and they need to report to that hospital in time once they get the call that

09:01.480 --> 09:03.400
an organ is available.

09:03.400 --> 09:08.960
When Steve Jobs received a liver transplant in 2009, for example, he did so in Memphis,

09:08.960 --> 09:12.100
Tennessee, far from where he lived in California.

09:12.100 --> 09:16.220
Tennessee is also considered as part of the stroke belt, and therefore the transplant

09:16.220 --> 09:20.240
region it is in, 11, has shorter wait times.

09:20.240 --> 09:24.340
Of course, wealthier people, such as Steve Jobs, are able to do things like fly in a

09:24.340 --> 09:29.140
private jet to get to the transplant hospital in time, and he even bought a house in Memphis

09:29.140 --> 09:31.180
to stay during his recovery.

09:31.180 --> 09:36.180
It's no wonder why there is such a strong positive correlation between patients listing

09:36.180 --> 09:39.340
in multiple regions and income levels.

09:39.340 --> 09:43.920
This system certainly perpetuates inequality, but the alternative is that a patient in New

09:43.920 --> 09:48.120
York is punished for the fact that their region is healthier.

09:48.120 --> 09:55.520
So, overall, the organ transplant system does not solve inequality, but only reduces it.

09:55.520 --> 10:00.820
Simultaneously, though, it does not have a mechanism to solve the issue of scarcity.

10:00.820 --> 10:05.580
The traditional market economy solves scarcity by paying people more money for what is in

10:05.580 --> 10:11.220
high demand, therefore, in theory, bringing things to an equilibrium, but this system

10:11.220 --> 10:15.100
has no way to increase supply when demand is higher.

10:15.100 --> 10:21.380
So, the current system is not perfectly ethical, and it also potentially exacerbates the shortage,

10:21.380 --> 10:27.100
so that has led some people to ask, what if we just used a normal economic market for

10:27.100 --> 10:29.500
organ allocation?

10:29.500 --> 10:32.060
That is what happened in Iran.

10:32.060 --> 10:36.480
Previously, the waiting list for kidneys in the country exceeded that of almost any

10:36.480 --> 10:41.900
other nation due to political instability and cultural stigma against organ donation.

10:41.900 --> 10:47.980
However, in 1988, they implemented a system where recipients could pay donors for their

10:47.980 --> 10:48.980
organs.

10:48.980 --> 10:54.780
Typically, a donor receives a fee of around $4,500, equivalent to more than half a year's

10:54.780 --> 10:58.540
salary, in addition to free health insurance for a year.

10:58.540 --> 11:04.100
Now, this isn't a truly free market—it is highly regulated and managed—but reports

11:04.100 --> 11:08.580
indicate that it has had some success at solving the scarcity problem.

11:08.580 --> 11:14.300
In the years after this program was implemented, organ donations skyrocketed and, apparently,

11:14.300 --> 11:18.160
there is no longer any waiting list in the country.

11:18.160 --> 11:23.100
That is quite a success compared to a country like the US, where thousands die each year

11:23.100 --> 11:28.820
waiting on a transplant, but opponents argue that the negatives are just too severe.

11:28.820 --> 11:33.140
When you commoditize organs, and especially kidneys, where humans can donate one and live

11:33.140 --> 11:37.300
using the other, you incentivize desperate individuals to sell theirs.

11:37.300 --> 11:42.300
Meanwhile, you make it even harder for poorer individuals to receive an organ transplant,

11:42.300 --> 11:44.420
as they can be priced out.

11:44.420 --> 11:51.400
Overall, an open organ market increases inequality, but also increases the number of transplants.

11:51.400 --> 11:58.200
In the end, that means there are two basic choices—saving more lives, but in an unequal,

11:58.200 --> 12:04.260
unfair manner, or saving fewer lives, but assuring a greater sense of fairness.

12:04.260 --> 12:08.960
Most countries have decided that the second option is better—they are potentially dooming

12:08.960 --> 12:13.480
some to die in the mission of assuring that what determines what gets you an organ is

12:13.480 --> 12:18.120
how much you need it, not how much you can pay for it—but there is increasing pressure

12:18.120 --> 12:22.680
in many places to stimulate supply with compensation.

12:22.680 --> 12:28.680
This is a situation where no solution is perfect—you can't have a perfectly abundant supply and

12:28.680 --> 12:33.640
you can't have a perfectly fair system, but you can get close to fair or close to

12:33.640 --> 12:35.800
abundance.

12:35.800 --> 12:40.460
Inequality is just part of a monetized system, so even though economics is an incredibly

12:40.460 --> 12:45.760
powerful tool for allocation, it must be used carefully in the cases where the stakes are

12:45.760 --> 12:49.400
truly life and death.

12:49.400 --> 12:55.800
Normally, gaining new skills requires quite a lot of commitment, both in time and money,

12:55.800 --> 12:58.560
but Skillshare breaks those barriers down.

12:58.560 --> 13:03.360
You can learn in short sessions online, making far more possible.

13:03.360 --> 13:07.280
What you can learn there ranges from classes on filmmaking at home all the way to how to

13:07.280 --> 13:09.160
use Evernote to boost your productivity.

13:09.160 --> 13:13.320
They really make sure that their portfolio of thousands of high-quality classes allow

13:13.320 --> 13:18.120
someone to both become super experienced in one thing, or fairly experienced in a lot

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120
of things.

13:19.120 --> 13:23.320
You can become an expert, or a generalist, depending on what you prefer.

13:23.320 --> 13:26.940
For those of you wanting to get into YouTube, I'd especially recommend Polymatter's

13:26.940 --> 13:31.660
classes on making animated YouTube videos and making great YouTube thumbnails.

13:31.660 --> 13:36.840
All around, Skillshare just makes so much possible, meaning all you have to do is get

13:36.840 --> 13:41.520
