3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,440
This is one block, in one city, in one state, of the United States.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,520
The US Constitution's Article I, Section 2 prescribes something that must happen, on

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,400
this block.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,340
may be included within this union according to their respective numbers.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,080
The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,600
Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,120
a manner as they shall by law direct.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,620
What that means is that every ten years, the US government must determine how many people

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,940
live on this block, in addition to how many people live on every other block in every

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,800
other city in every other state and territory of the United States.

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,120
They must determine the population of the country—a straightforward task, but one

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,400
that thousands of US Census Bureau employees spend a decade preparing for and a year and

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,340
$15.6 billion executing.

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:13,400
It turns out that counting more than 300 million people isn't exactly easy.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,840
Instead of looking at how the census counts every one of those hundreds of millions, let's

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,400
rather look at how they count the couple dozen people living on this one city block.

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,920
The Bureau started preparing for the 2020 census on November 1st, 2011.

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,640
They have a staff of about 4,000 who plan and coordinate each census, along with their

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,180
other programs, and then, every ten years, when it comes time to actually conduct the

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,480
census, they employ more than half a million other individuals temporarily.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,840
The 4,000 full-time employees, though, spend much of the decade forming their operational

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,120
plan, the first draft of which was done in late 2015.

26
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,240
They then spend the next three years refining that.

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,580
A significant element of this plan includes deciding where the census's field offices

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,080
will be located.

29
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,920
You see, the census divides the country up into six regions which are headquartered with

30
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,000
permanent offices in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and New York

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
City.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,480
Then, within those regions, the census opens up 248 temporary field offices to conduct

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,180
local operations.

34
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,200
These field offices are distributed based on density so Colorado, for example, only

35
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,800
has four, while New York, on the other hand, has 21.

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,400
Each of these offices has to hire hundreds or thousands of enumerators to go out into

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,880
the streets and conduct the census.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,440
Finding half a million temporary workers is of course incredibly difficult, and it's

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,840
even more difficult for the 2020 census given that the country currently has the lowest

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
unemployment rate in recent history.

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,260
In order to attract those half million people, they do have to account for the drastically

42
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,500
different wage conditions across the country.

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,340
Workers in Mesa County, Colorado, where our block is located, for example, are paid $16

44
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,420
per hour which, for this area, is a pretty decent hourly wage, especially for a low-skilled

45
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,740
job requiring few qualifications.

46
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,960
Of course, if you offer that pay in New York City, on the other hand, it would be far less

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,700
attractive so the pay there is up to between $25 and $28 an hour.

48
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,060
Despite this decent pay, though, the census still always has enormous difficulty filling

49
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,620
all their positions so they spend years teeing up all these workers.

50
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,340
The first of the temporary hires for the 2020 census happened in mid-2018.

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,680
That's because, before the census can go and ask every household on this block how

52
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,320
many people live there, they have to figure out where each of these households is.

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:38,520
In the past ten years, new houses could have been built, structures could have been subdivided,

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,800
and plenty more could have changed, so this is a crucial step for accuracy.

55
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,560
In addition, if a homeless person is living in this alley, if someone's living in a

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,440
motor home in someone's driveway, or if there are any other abnormal residences, this

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,320
too needs to be counted.

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,700
Previously, the census would have sent someone to walk this block, in addition to every other

59
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,520
block in the country, and mark down where each residence is, which clearly took an enormous

60
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,340
amount of person hours.

61
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,980
With the 2020 census, though, they're shifting technique to use more and more satellite imagery

62
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,060
to identify residences.

63
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,500
Of course, that's not perfect.

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,580
For example, it's hard to tell if this is one residence or two, so for any areas that

65
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,380
they're not sure about, they'll still send people to check in person.

66
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,620
At the conclusion of this process, at least in theory, they should have a list of every

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,500
single place where people live in the US.

68
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,700
Also, in 2018, the Census Bureau had to submit to Congress the questions they planned to

69
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,580
ask the American public.

70
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:41,500
The census is incredibly simple—after all, it has to be if they expect everyone to answer

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
it.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,500
It asks four background questions, five about the primary resident, and seven about every

73
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,620
other resident of a given household.

74
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,820
Despite this, the Bureau spends an enormous amount of time debating how to ask these questions.

75
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,360
Question selection is so complex that they published a 98-page document explaining how

76
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
they selected the 2020 questions and their wording.

77
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,480
For example, in question three, for the non-primary residents, they added specification on whether

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,040
their relation to the primary resident was as a same-sex or opposite-sex couple.

79
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,320
In the past, there was the option to mark the relation as a spouse or unmarried partner,

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
but there was no distinction between same-sex or opposite-sex.

81
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,700
They did, however, calculate what percentage of couples were same-sex based on how they

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,880
responded to the question asking if they were male or female.

83
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,920
There was an issue with that, though.

84
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,480
Say there's a married couple living in this house consisting of one man and one woman.

85
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,400
If the woman accidentally marked her sex as male and also marked her relationship as a

86
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,640
spouse, they would be counted as a same-sex married couple.

87
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,720
Given that the overall proportion of census-surveyed couples who are same-sex is small, these mistakes

88
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,140
could significantly skew the data.

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,320
With the redesign of this question, it acts as a failsafe so that even if the woman in

90
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,400
the house marks her sex as male, they'll still be counted as an opposite-sex couple.

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,400
These are the tiny details the Bureau has to think about for each and every question

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
and change.

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,760
They have to think about how to best structure them to get the best possible accuracy.

94
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,160
Once they have their questions, one of the final things the census needs to figure out

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,540
is how they're actually going to ask for responses.

96
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:22,880
Our block is located in Grand Junction, Colorado, which is a small city, so it, along with most

97
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,400
of the country, simply receives a mailed invitation instructing the recipient to complete the

98
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,160
census online.

99
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,720
This works well for most of this relatively urban area, but not for all of it.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,920
For example, residences in this small section of Grand Junction will receive both an invitation

101
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,800
to complete the census online and a paper census form.

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,640
That's because it's home to a number of assisted living facilities and therefore a

103
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,660
number of older individuals who are far less likely to respond online.

104
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:55,920
About 22% of the country is classified by the census as areas where individuals are

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:00,940
less likely to respond online and therefore receive paper census forms as well.

106
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,840
There are, though, areas where both of these options won't work.

107
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,140
Nearby Eagle County, for example, has a population where one-third are of Hispanic origin and

108
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,720
plenty of that population has limited or no English language skills.

109
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
Therefore, residences here receive a bilingual invitation to complete the census online.

110
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,960
There's then one more category, used in areas like Costilla County where there is

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,320
a large Spanish population and limited internet access, where bilingual paper census forms

112
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
are sent out.

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,800
The census classifies the entirety of the country into one of these four categories

114
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,520
in order to have the best possible chance of getting an answer.

115
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,360
Once offices are opened, employees are hired, residences are logged, questions are written,

116
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,800
and letters are planned, it's finally time for the census to start in earnest.

117
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,800
The first census responses cannot happen until 2020 starts, and all responses must be in

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,200
by the time 2020 finishes.

119
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,440
They have exactly 366 days to count every single person in the US and deliver that count

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,080
to the US Congress.

121
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,800
Our block, in Grand Junction, is far from the first place to be counted, though.

122
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,980
That happens in Tuksuk Bay, Alaska.

123
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,680
Census workers arrive there in late January, 2020.

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,080
Tuksuk Bay, along with 200 or so other rural Alaskan towns, are exceptions in the overall

125
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,520
timeline of the census count as, in midwinter, when the water and ground are frozen, one

126
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,800
can get around relatively easily on snowmobile whereas, later on, when most of the country's

127
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,000
census counting is done, it's very tough to travel when the ice and snow are melting.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Down in the lower 48, the seasons are far less of a concern so in mid-March, 95% of

129
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,080
American households receive a mailed invitation to fill in the census online.

130
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,440
That includes our block, but if the earlier investigation found someone living in a mobile

131
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,640
home in someone's driveway there, they would likely get their invitation hand-delivered.

132
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,620
Mobile homes, residences in areas with recent natural disasters, or households that use

133
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,080
PO boxes, don't get mail delivered to their door so that's when the census uses this

134
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,700
hand-delivery technique which is used in about 4% of cases.

135
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,820
A small other proportion, less than 1%, is visited and surveyed in-person from the first

136
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,340
instance, mostly in the most remote areas of Alaska and Maine, in addition to on some

137
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,580
American Indian reservations.

138
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,380
On our block, like most others, if households don't respond to the first invitation, they'll

139
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,260
get a reminder letter, then a reminder postcard, then a reminder letter with a paper questionnaire,

140
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,880
then one more reminder postcard before the census gives up on the household responding

141
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,980
by internet, mail, or phone.

142
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,820
Typically, about a third of the houses on this block will not have responded on time,

143
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,740
even though it's a legal requirement.

144
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,260
Non-respondent residences on our block will get a visit from an enumerator, but they might

145
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,300
not be the first to get visited.

146
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,900
In-person visits are prioritized strategically.

147
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,360
For example, knowing that college students will start to move out from their dorms and

148
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,820
student housing starting in mid-May, they send enumerators to non-respondents at college

149
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,660
campuses first.

150
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,660
Each of our houses will get three visits, then if they don't respond on the fourth,

151
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,480
they'll also try to ask neighbors if they know the details of the residence of the given

152
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
household.

153
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,560
They'll try both the household and the neighbors again for the fifth and sixth try, but then,

154
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,740
if the household doesn't respond after five mailings, six visits, and three knocks on

155
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:27,740
the neighbors' doors, then the census finally decides that the residence must be uninhabited.

156
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:31,480
Of course, in addition to counting everyone in every household, they'll also have to

157
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,540
count people who don't live in a household.

158
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,280
For example, to count homeless people, the census will set up at shelters, soup kitchens,

159
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,020
food vans, in addition to just going out into the streets.

160
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,920
Another challenge is counting people who live and work on American ships who don't have

161
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,520
a permanent residence.

162
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,960
The census runs a special program for this, the Maritime and Military Vessel Enumeration,

163
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,620
where ships are sent census kits including customized forms with different questions

164
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,560
targeted at seafarers.

165
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,160
These are all then sent back to the census to be included in the count, and a variety

166
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
of techniques are used to assure that nobody is double-counted.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,600
Throughout the second half of 2020, in-person visits will finish up, special operations

168
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,980
will conclude, and the census will get into a huge number-crunching operation to figure

169
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,740
out, with as much accuracy as possible, what the final count is.

170
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,700
They not only have to give that total number, but they also have to break it down by state,

171
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,940
by county, by town, by race, by age, by relationship status, and by much, much more.

172
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:37,200
It takes some time, but there's a very, very specific deadline—December 31st, 2020.

173
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,460
The US Congress needs to know the count by then in order to reallocate seats in the House

174
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,000
of Representatives proportionally to the population of the states.

175
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,740
In the 2010 census, 308,745,538 people were counted as living in the US.

176
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,660
In 2020, the number is expected to be around 330 million, but, to know for sure, we'll

177
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,820
just have to wait for December 31st, 2020.

178
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,500
One of the big jobs at the Census Bureau is as a math statistician and for that, according

179
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,200
to their job listing, you need to be adept at things like number theory, statistics,

180
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,680
probability, algebra, and calculus—all of which you can learn or brush up on with Brilliant.

181
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,920
Each of their courses for each of those subjects is interactive, wonderfully designed, and

182
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,460
helps you learn complex topics like calculus, not through rote memorization, but rather

183
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,880
through breaking down the concepts into small, intuitive chunks and then building it all

184
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,400
back together.

185
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,820
This is how you can truly understand calculus or number theory or statistics, rather than

186
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,540
just learning the process to solve problems.

187
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:45,440
If math isn't your thing, they also have dozens of amazing other courses on subjects

188
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,060
like scientific thinking, quantum mechanics, computer science, and plenty more.

189
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,380
