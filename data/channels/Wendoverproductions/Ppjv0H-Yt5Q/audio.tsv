9600	15440	This is one block, in one city, in one state, of the United States.
15440	20520	The US Constitution's Article I, Section 2 prescribes something that must happen, on
20520	22400	this block.
22400	25920	Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which
25920	30340	may be included within this union according to their respective numbers.
30340	34080	The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the
34080	38600	Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such
38600	42120	a manner as they shall by law direct.
42120	46620	What that means is that every ten years, the US government must determine how many people
46620	50940	live on this block, in addition to how many people live on every other block in every
50940	54800	other city in every other state and territory of the United States.
54800	59120	They must determine the population of the country—a straightforward task, but one
59120	64400	that thousands of US Census Bureau employees spend a decade preparing for and a year and
64400	67340	$15.6 billion executing.
67340	73400	It turns out that counting more than 300 million people isn't exactly easy.
73400	77840	Instead of looking at how the census counts every one of those hundreds of millions, let's
77840	83400	rather look at how they count the couple dozen people living on this one city block.
83400	88920	The Bureau started preparing for the 2020 census on November 1st, 2011.
88920	93640	They have a staff of about 4,000 who plan and coordinate each census, along with their
93640	98180	other programs, and then, every ten years, when it comes time to actually conduct the
98180	102480	census, they employ more than half a million other individuals temporarily.
102480	106840	The 4,000 full-time employees, though, spend much of the decade forming their operational
106840	110120	plan, the first draft of which was done in late 2015.
110120	113240	They then spend the next three years refining that.
113240	117580	A significant element of this plan includes deciding where the census's field offices
117580	119080	will be located.
119080	122920	You see, the census divides the country up into six regions which are headquartered with
122920	128000	permanent offices in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and New York
128000	129000	City.
129000	134480	Then, within those regions, the census opens up 248 temporary field offices to conduct
134480	136180	local operations.
136180	140200	These field offices are distributed based on density so Colorado, for example, only
140200	143800	has four, while New York, on the other hand, has 21.
143800	148400	Each of these offices has to hire hundreds or thousands of enumerators to go out into
148400	150880	the streets and conduct the census.
150880	155440	Finding half a million temporary workers is of course incredibly difficult, and it's
155440	159840	even more difficult for the 2020 census given that the country currently has the lowest
159840	162160	unemployment rate in recent history.
162160	166260	In order to attract those half million people, they do have to account for the drastically
166260	169500	different wage conditions across the country.
169500	174340	Workers in Mesa County, Colorado, where our block is located, for example, are paid $16
174340	179420	per hour which, for this area, is a pretty decent hourly wage, especially for a low-skilled
179420	181740	job requiring few qualifications.
181740	185960	Of course, if you offer that pay in New York City, on the other hand, it would be far less
185960	191700	attractive so the pay there is up to between $25 and $28 an hour.
191700	196060	Despite this decent pay, though, the census still always has enormous difficulty filling
196060	200620	all their positions so they spend years teeing up all these workers.
200620	204340	The first of the temporary hires for the 2020 census happened in mid-2018.
204340	209680	That's because, before the census can go and ask every household on this block how
209680	214320	many people live there, they have to figure out where each of these households is.
214320	218520	In the past ten years, new houses could have been built, structures could have been subdivided,
218520	222800	and plenty more could have changed, so this is a crucial step for accuracy.
222800	226560	In addition, if a homeless person is living in this alley, if someone's living in a
226560	231440	motor home in someone's driveway, or if there are any other abnormal residences, this
231440	233320	too needs to be counted.
233320	237700	Previously, the census would have sent someone to walk this block, in addition to every other
237700	242520	block in the country, and mark down where each residence is, which clearly took an enormous
242520	244340	amount of person hours.
244340	248980	With the 2020 census, though, they're shifting technique to use more and more satellite imagery
248980	251060	to identify residences.
251060	253500	Of course, that's not perfect.
253500	258580	For example, it's hard to tell if this is one residence or two, so for any areas that
258580	262380	they're not sure about, they'll still send people to check in person.
262380	266620	At the conclusion of this process, at least in theory, they should have a list of every
266620	269500	single place where people live in the US.
269500	274700	Also, in 2018, the Census Bureau had to submit to Congress the questions they planned to
274700	276580	ask the American public.
276580	281500	The census is incredibly simple—after all, it has to be if they expect everyone to answer
281500	282500	it.
282500	286500	It asks four background questions, five about the primary resident, and seven about every
286500	288620	other resident of a given household.
288620	294820	Despite this, the Bureau spends an enormous amount of time debating how to ask these questions.
294820	299360	Question selection is so complex that they published a 98-page document explaining how
299360	302560	they selected the 2020 questions and their wording.
302560	307480	For example, in question three, for the non-primary residents, they added specification on whether
307480	312040	their relation to the primary resident was as a same-sex or opposite-sex couple.
312040	316320	In the past, there was the option to mark the relation as a spouse or unmarried partner,
316320	319680	but there was no distinction between same-sex or opposite-sex.
319680	324700	They did, however, calculate what percentage of couples were same-sex based on how they
324700	327880	responded to the question asking if they were male or female.
327880	329920	There was an issue with that, though.
329920	334480	Say there's a married couple living in this house consisting of one man and one woman.
334480	338400	If the woman accidentally marked her sex as male and also marked her relationship as a
338400	342640	spouse, they would be counted as a same-sex married couple.
342640	347720	Given that the overall proportion of census-surveyed couples who are same-sex is small, these mistakes
347720	350140	could significantly skew the data.
350140	354320	With the redesign of this question, it acts as a failsafe so that even if the woman in
354320	359400	the house marks her sex as male, they'll still be counted as an opposite-sex couple.
359400	363400	These are the tiny details the Bureau has to think about for each and every question
363400	364400	and change.
364400	369760	They have to think about how to best structure them to get the best possible accuracy.
369760	374160	Once they have their questions, one of the final things the census needs to figure out
374160	377540	is how they're actually going to ask for responses.
377540	382880	Our block is located in Grand Junction, Colorado, which is a small city, so it, along with most
382880	387400	of the country, simply receives a mailed invitation instructing the recipient to complete the
387400	389160	census online.
389160	393720	This works well for most of this relatively urban area, but not for all of it.
393720	398920	For example, residences in this small section of Grand Junction will receive both an invitation
398920	402800	to complete the census online and a paper census form.
402800	406640	That's because it's home to a number of assisted living facilities and therefore a
406640	411660	number of older individuals who are far less likely to respond online.
411660	415920	About 22% of the country is classified by the census as areas where individuals are
415920	420940	less likely to respond online and therefore receive paper census forms as well.
420940	424840	There are, though, areas where both of these options won't work.
424840	430140	Nearby Eagle County, for example, has a population where one-third are of Hispanic origin and
430140	434720	plenty of that population has limited or no English language skills.
434720	439840	Therefore, residences here receive a bilingual invitation to complete the census online.
439840	443960	There's then one more category, used in areas like Costilla County where there is
443960	449320	a large Spanish population and limited internet access, where bilingual paper census forms
449320	450600	are sent out.
450600	454800	The census classifies the entirety of the country into one of these four categories
454800	458520	in order to have the best possible chance of getting an answer.
458520	463360	Once offices are opened, employees are hired, residences are logged, questions are written,
463360	467800	and letters are planned, it's finally time for the census to start in earnest.
467800	472800	The first census responses cannot happen until 2020 starts, and all responses must be in
472800	475200	by the time 2020 finishes.
475200	481440	They have exactly 366 days to count every single person in the US and deliver that count
481440	483080	to the US Congress.
483080	487800	Our block, in Grand Junction, is far from the first place to be counted, though.
487800	490980	That happens in Tuksuk Bay, Alaska.
490980	494680	Census workers arrive there in late January, 2020.
494680	500080	Tuksuk Bay, along with 200 or so other rural Alaskan towns, are exceptions in the overall
500080	505520	timeline of the census count as, in midwinter, when the water and ground are frozen, one
505520	510800	can get around relatively easily on snowmobile whereas, later on, when most of the country's
510800	516000	census counting is done, it's very tough to travel when the ice and snow are melting.
516000	521840	Down in the lower 48, the seasons are far less of a concern so in mid-March, 95% of
521840	527080	American households receive a mailed invitation to fill in the census online.
527080	531440	That includes our block, but if the earlier investigation found someone living in a mobile
531440	536640	home in someone's driveway there, they would likely get their invitation hand-delivered.
536640	540620	Mobile homes, residences in areas with recent natural disasters, or households that use
540620	545080	PO boxes, don't get mail delivered to their door so that's when the census uses this
545080	549700	hand-delivery technique which is used in about 4% of cases.
549700	554820	A small other proportion, less than 1%, is visited and surveyed in-person from the first
554820	559340	instance, mostly in the most remote areas of Alaska and Maine, in addition to on some
559340	561580	American Indian reservations.
561580	566380	On our block, like most others, if households don't respond to the first invitation, they'll
566380	571260	get a reminder letter, then a reminder postcard, then a reminder letter with a paper questionnaire,
571260	574880	then one more reminder postcard before the census gives up on the household responding
574880	576980	by internet, mail, or phone.
576980	581820	Typically, about a third of the houses on this block will not have responded on time,
581820	584740	even though it's a legal requirement.
584740	589260	Non-respondent residences on our block will get a visit from an enumerator, but they might
589260	592300	not be the first to get visited.
592300	594900	In-person visits are prioritized strategically.
594900	598360	For example, knowing that college students will start to move out from their dorms and
598360	602820	student housing starting in mid-May, they send enumerators to non-respondents at college
602820	604660	campuses first.
604660	608660	Each of our houses will get three visits, then if they don't respond on the fourth,
608660	612480	they'll also try to ask neighbors if they know the details of the residence of the given
612480	613480	household.
613480	617560	They'll try both the household and the neighbors again for the fifth and sixth try, but then,
617560	621740	if the household doesn't respond after five mailings, six visits, and three knocks on
621740	627740	the neighbors' doors, then the census finally decides that the residence must be uninhabited.
627740	631480	Of course, in addition to counting everyone in every household, they'll also have to
631480	634540	count people who don't live in a household.
634540	639280	For example, to count homeless people, the census will set up at shelters, soup kitchens,
639280	643020	food vans, in addition to just going out into the streets.
643560	646920	Another challenge is counting people who live and work on American ships who don't have
646920	648520	a permanent residence.
648520	652960	The census runs a special program for this, the Maritime and Military Vessel Enumeration,
652960	656620	where ships are sent census kits including customized forms with different questions
656620	658560	targeted at seafarers.
658560	662160	These are all then sent back to the census to be included in the count, and a variety
662160	666000	of techniques are used to assure that nobody is double-counted.
666000	670600	Throughout the second half of 2020, in-person visits will finish up, special operations
670620	674980	will conclude, and the census will get into a huge number-crunching operation to figure
674980	679740	out, with as much accuracy as possible, what the final count is.
679740	683700	They not only have to give that total number, but they also have to break it down by state,
683700	689940	by county, by town, by race, by age, by relationship status, and by much, much more.
689940	697200	It takes some time, but there's a very, very specific deadline—December 31st, 2020.
697200	701460	The US Congress needs to know the count by then in order to reallocate seats in the House
701460	705000	of Representatives proportionally to the population of the states.
705000	713740	In the 2010 census, 308,745,538 people were counted as living in the US.
713740	719660	In 2020, the number is expected to be around 330 million, but, to know for sure, we'll
719660	724820	just have to wait for December 31st, 2020.
724820	729500	One of the big jobs at the Census Bureau is as a math statistician and for that, according
729500	734200	to their job listing, you need to be adept at things like number theory, statistics,
734200	739680	probability, algebra, and calculus—all of which you can learn or brush up on with Brilliant.
739680	743920	Each of their courses for each of those subjects is interactive, wonderfully designed, and
743920	748460	helps you learn complex topics like calculus, not through rote memorization, but rather
748460	752880	through breaking down the concepts into small, intuitive chunks and then building it all
752880	754400	back together.
754400	758820	This is how you can truly understand calculus or number theory or statistics, rather than
758820	761540	just learning the process to solve problems.
761540	765440	If math isn't your thing, they also have dozens of amazing other courses on subjects
765440	770060	like scientific thinking, quantum mechanics, computer science, and plenty more.
