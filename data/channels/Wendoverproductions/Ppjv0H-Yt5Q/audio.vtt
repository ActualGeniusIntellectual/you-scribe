00:09.600 --> 00:15.440
This is one block, in one city, in one state, of the United States.

00:15.440 --> 00:20.520
The US Constitution's Article I, Section 2 prescribes something that must happen, on

00:20.520 --> 00:22.400
this block.

00:22.400 --> 00:25.920
Representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several states which

00:25.920 --> 00:30.340
may be included within this union according to their respective numbers.

00:30.340 --> 00:34.080
The actual enumeration shall be made within three years after the first meeting of the

00:34.080 --> 00:38.600
Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent term of ten years, in such

00:38.600 --> 00:42.120
a manner as they shall by law direct.

00:42.120 --> 00:46.620
What that means is that every ten years, the US government must determine how many people

00:46.620 --> 00:50.940
live on this block, in addition to how many people live on every other block in every

00:50.940 --> 00:54.800
other city in every other state and territory of the United States.

00:54.800 --> 00:59.120
They must determine the population of the country—a straightforward task, but one

00:59.120 --> 01:04.400
that thousands of US Census Bureau employees spend a decade preparing for and a year and

01:04.400 --> 01:07.340
$15.6 billion executing.

01:07.340 --> 01:13.400
It turns out that counting more than 300 million people isn't exactly easy.

01:13.400 --> 01:17.840
Instead of looking at how the census counts every one of those hundreds of millions, let's

01:17.840 --> 01:23.400
rather look at how they count the couple dozen people living on this one city block.

01:23.400 --> 01:28.920
The Bureau started preparing for the 2020 census on November 1st, 2011.

01:28.920 --> 01:33.640
They have a staff of about 4,000 who plan and coordinate each census, along with their

01:33.640 --> 01:38.180
other programs, and then, every ten years, when it comes time to actually conduct the

01:38.180 --> 01:42.480
census, they employ more than half a million other individuals temporarily.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.840
The 4,000 full-time employees, though, spend much of the decade forming their operational

01:46.840 --> 01:50.120
plan, the first draft of which was done in late 2015.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.240
They then spend the next three years refining that.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.580
A significant element of this plan includes deciding where the census's field offices

01:57.580 --> 01:59.080
will be located.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.920
You see, the census divides the country up into six regions which are headquartered with

02:02.920 --> 02:08.000
permanent offices in Los Angeles, Denver, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and New York

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
City.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.480
Then, within those regions, the census opens up 248 temporary field offices to conduct

02:14.480 --> 02:16.180
local operations.

02:16.180 --> 02:20.200
These field offices are distributed based on density so Colorado, for example, only

02:20.200 --> 02:23.800
has four, while New York, on the other hand, has 21.

02:23.800 --> 02:28.400
Each of these offices has to hire hundreds or thousands of enumerators to go out into

02:28.400 --> 02:30.880
the streets and conduct the census.

02:30.880 --> 02:35.440
Finding half a million temporary workers is of course incredibly difficult, and it's

02:35.440 --> 02:39.840
even more difficult for the 2020 census given that the country currently has the lowest

02:39.840 --> 02:42.160
unemployment rate in recent history.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.260
In order to attract those half million people, they do have to account for the drastically

02:46.260 --> 02:49.500
different wage conditions across the country.

02:49.500 --> 02:54.340
Workers in Mesa County, Colorado, where our block is located, for example, are paid $16

02:54.340 --> 02:59.420
per hour which, for this area, is a pretty decent hourly wage, especially for a low-skilled

02:59.420 --> 03:01.740
job requiring few qualifications.

03:01.740 --> 03:05.960
Of course, if you offer that pay in New York City, on the other hand, it would be far less

03:05.960 --> 03:11.700
attractive so the pay there is up to between $25 and $28 an hour.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.060
Despite this decent pay, though, the census still always has enormous difficulty filling

03:16.060 --> 03:20.620
all their positions so they spend years teeing up all these workers.

03:20.620 --> 03:24.340
The first of the temporary hires for the 2020 census happened in mid-2018.

03:24.340 --> 03:29.680
That's because, before the census can go and ask every household on this block how

03:29.680 --> 03:34.320
many people live there, they have to figure out where each of these households is.

03:34.320 --> 03:38.520
In the past ten years, new houses could have been built, structures could have been subdivided,

03:38.520 --> 03:42.800
and plenty more could have changed, so this is a crucial step for accuracy.

03:42.800 --> 03:46.560
In addition, if a homeless person is living in this alley, if someone's living in a

03:46.560 --> 03:51.440
motor home in someone's driveway, or if there are any other abnormal residences, this

03:51.440 --> 03:53.320
too needs to be counted.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.700
Previously, the census would have sent someone to walk this block, in addition to every other

03:57.700 --> 04:02.520
block in the country, and mark down where each residence is, which clearly took an enormous

04:02.520 --> 04:04.340
amount of person hours.

04:04.340 --> 04:08.980
With the 2020 census, though, they're shifting technique to use more and more satellite imagery

04:08.980 --> 04:11.060
to identify residences.

04:11.060 --> 04:13.500
Of course, that's not perfect.

04:13.500 --> 04:18.580
For example, it's hard to tell if this is one residence or two, so for any areas that

04:18.580 --> 04:22.380
they're not sure about, they'll still send people to check in person.

04:22.380 --> 04:26.620
At the conclusion of this process, at least in theory, they should have a list of every

04:26.620 --> 04:29.500
single place where people live in the US.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.700
Also, in 2018, the Census Bureau had to submit to Congress the questions they planned to

04:34.700 --> 04:36.580
ask the American public.

04:36.580 --> 04:41.500
The census is incredibly simple—after all, it has to be if they expect everyone to answer

04:41.500 --> 04:42.500
it.

04:42.500 --> 04:46.500
It asks four background questions, five about the primary resident, and seven about every

04:46.500 --> 04:48.620
other resident of a given household.

04:48.620 --> 04:54.820
Despite this, the Bureau spends an enormous amount of time debating how to ask these questions.

04:54.820 --> 04:59.360
Question selection is so complex that they published a 98-page document explaining how

04:59.360 --> 05:02.560
they selected the 2020 questions and their wording.

05:02.560 --> 05:07.480
For example, in question three, for the non-primary residents, they added specification on whether

05:07.480 --> 05:12.040
their relation to the primary resident was as a same-sex or opposite-sex couple.

05:12.040 --> 05:16.320
In the past, there was the option to mark the relation as a spouse or unmarried partner,

05:16.320 --> 05:19.680
but there was no distinction between same-sex or opposite-sex.

05:19.680 --> 05:24.700
They did, however, calculate what percentage of couples were same-sex based on how they

05:24.700 --> 05:27.880
responded to the question asking if they were male or female.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.920
There was an issue with that, though.

05:29.920 --> 05:34.480
Say there's a married couple living in this house consisting of one man and one woman.

05:34.480 --> 05:38.400
If the woman accidentally marked her sex as male and also marked her relationship as a

05:38.400 --> 05:42.640
spouse, they would be counted as a same-sex married couple.

05:42.640 --> 05:47.720
Given that the overall proportion of census-surveyed couples who are same-sex is small, these mistakes

05:47.720 --> 05:50.140
could significantly skew the data.

05:50.140 --> 05:54.320
With the redesign of this question, it acts as a failsafe so that even if the woman in

05:54.320 --> 05:59.400
the house marks her sex as male, they'll still be counted as an opposite-sex couple.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.400
These are the tiny details the Bureau has to think about for each and every question

06:03.400 --> 06:04.400
and change.

06:04.400 --> 06:09.760
They have to think about how to best structure them to get the best possible accuracy.

06:09.760 --> 06:14.160
Once they have their questions, one of the final things the census needs to figure out

06:14.160 --> 06:17.540
is how they're actually going to ask for responses.

06:17.540 --> 06:22.880
Our block is located in Grand Junction, Colorado, which is a small city, so it, along with most

06:22.880 --> 06:27.400
of the country, simply receives a mailed invitation instructing the recipient to complete the

06:27.400 --> 06:29.160
census online.

06:29.160 --> 06:33.720
This works well for most of this relatively urban area, but not for all of it.

06:33.720 --> 06:38.920
For example, residences in this small section of Grand Junction will receive both an invitation

06:38.920 --> 06:42.800
to complete the census online and a paper census form.

06:42.800 --> 06:46.640
That's because it's home to a number of assisted living facilities and therefore a

06:46.640 --> 06:51.660
number of older individuals who are far less likely to respond online.

06:51.660 --> 06:55.920
About 22% of the country is classified by the census as areas where individuals are

06:55.920 --> 07:00.940
less likely to respond online and therefore receive paper census forms as well.

07:00.940 --> 07:04.840
There are, though, areas where both of these options won't work.

07:04.840 --> 07:10.140
Nearby Eagle County, for example, has a population where one-third are of Hispanic origin and

07:10.140 --> 07:14.720
plenty of that population has limited or no English language skills.

07:14.720 --> 07:19.840
Therefore, residences here receive a bilingual invitation to complete the census online.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.960
There's then one more category, used in areas like Costilla County where there is

07:23.960 --> 07:29.320
a large Spanish population and limited internet access, where bilingual paper census forms

07:29.320 --> 07:30.600
are sent out.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.800
The census classifies the entirety of the country into one of these four categories

07:34.800 --> 07:38.520
in order to have the best possible chance of getting an answer.

07:38.520 --> 07:43.360
Once offices are opened, employees are hired, residences are logged, questions are written,

07:43.360 --> 07:47.800
and letters are planned, it's finally time for the census to start in earnest.

07:47.800 --> 07:52.800
The first census responses cannot happen until 2020 starts, and all responses must be in

07:52.800 --> 07:55.200
by the time 2020 finishes.

07:55.200 --> 08:01.440
They have exactly 366 days to count every single person in the US and deliver that count

08:01.440 --> 08:03.080
to the US Congress.

08:03.080 --> 08:07.800
Our block, in Grand Junction, is far from the first place to be counted, though.

08:07.800 --> 08:10.980
That happens in Tuksuk Bay, Alaska.

08:10.980 --> 08:14.680
Census workers arrive there in late January, 2020.

08:14.680 --> 08:20.080
Tuksuk Bay, along with 200 or so other rural Alaskan towns, are exceptions in the overall

08:20.080 --> 08:25.520
timeline of the census count as, in midwinter, when the water and ground are frozen, one

08:25.520 --> 08:30.800
can get around relatively easily on snowmobile whereas, later on, when most of the country's

08:30.800 --> 08:36.000
census counting is done, it's very tough to travel when the ice and snow are melting.

08:36.000 --> 08:41.840
Down in the lower 48, the seasons are far less of a concern so in mid-March, 95% of

08:41.840 --> 08:47.080
American households receive a mailed invitation to fill in the census online.

08:47.080 --> 08:51.440
That includes our block, but if the earlier investigation found someone living in a mobile

08:51.440 --> 08:56.640
home in someone's driveway there, they would likely get their invitation hand-delivered.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.620
Mobile homes, residences in areas with recent natural disasters, or households that use

09:00.620 --> 09:05.080
PO boxes, don't get mail delivered to their door so that's when the census uses this

09:05.080 --> 09:09.700
hand-delivery technique which is used in about 4% of cases.

09:09.700 --> 09:14.820
A small other proportion, less than 1%, is visited and surveyed in-person from the first

09:14.820 --> 09:19.340
instance, mostly in the most remote areas of Alaska and Maine, in addition to on some

09:19.340 --> 09:21.580
American Indian reservations.

09:21.580 --> 09:26.380
On our block, like most others, if households don't respond to the first invitation, they'll

09:26.380 --> 09:31.260
get a reminder letter, then a reminder postcard, then a reminder letter with a paper questionnaire,

09:31.260 --> 09:34.880
then one more reminder postcard before the census gives up on the household responding

09:34.880 --> 09:36.980
by internet, mail, or phone.

09:36.980 --> 09:41.820
Typically, about a third of the houses on this block will not have responded on time,

09:41.820 --> 09:44.740
even though it's a legal requirement.

09:44.740 --> 09:49.260
Non-respondent residences on our block will get a visit from an enumerator, but they might

09:49.260 --> 09:52.300
not be the first to get visited.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.900
In-person visits are prioritized strategically.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.360
For example, knowing that college students will start to move out from their dorms and

09:58.360 --> 10:02.820
student housing starting in mid-May, they send enumerators to non-respondents at college

10:02.820 --> 10:04.660
campuses first.

10:04.660 --> 10:08.660
Each of our houses will get three visits, then if they don't respond on the fourth,

10:08.660 --> 10:12.480
they'll also try to ask neighbors if they know the details of the residence of the given

10:12.480 --> 10:13.480
household.

10:13.480 --> 10:17.560
They'll try both the household and the neighbors again for the fifth and sixth try, but then,

10:17.560 --> 10:21.740
if the household doesn't respond after five mailings, six visits, and three knocks on

10:21.740 --> 10:27.740
the neighbors' doors, then the census finally decides that the residence must be uninhabited.

10:27.740 --> 10:31.480
Of course, in addition to counting everyone in every household, they'll also have to

10:31.480 --> 10:34.540
count people who don't live in a household.

10:34.540 --> 10:39.280
For example, to count homeless people, the census will set up at shelters, soup kitchens,

10:39.280 --> 10:43.020
food vans, in addition to just going out into the streets.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.920
Another challenge is counting people who live and work on American ships who don't have

10:46.920 --> 10:48.520
a permanent residence.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.960
The census runs a special program for this, the Maritime and Military Vessel Enumeration,

10:52.960 --> 10:56.620
where ships are sent census kits including customized forms with different questions

10:56.620 --> 10:58.560
targeted at seafarers.

10:58.560 --> 11:02.160
These are all then sent back to the census to be included in the count, and a variety

11:02.160 --> 11:06.000
of techniques are used to assure that nobody is double-counted.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.600
Throughout the second half of 2020, in-person visits will finish up, special operations

11:10.620 --> 11:14.980
will conclude, and the census will get into a huge number-crunching operation to figure

11:14.980 --> 11:19.740
out, with as much accuracy as possible, what the final count is.

11:19.740 --> 11:23.700
They not only have to give that total number, but they also have to break it down by state,

11:23.700 --> 11:29.940
by county, by town, by race, by age, by relationship status, and by much, much more.

11:29.940 --> 11:37.200
It takes some time, but there's a very, very specific deadline—December 31st, 2020.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.460
The US Congress needs to know the count by then in order to reallocate seats in the House

11:41.460 --> 11:45.000
of Representatives proportionally to the population of the states.

11:45.000 --> 11:53.740
In the 2010 census, 308,745,538 people were counted as living in the US.

11:53.740 --> 11:59.660
In 2020, the number is expected to be around 330 million, but, to know for sure, we'll

11:59.660 --> 12:04.820
just have to wait for December 31st, 2020.

12:04.820 --> 12:09.500
One of the big jobs at the Census Bureau is as a math statistician and for that, according

12:09.500 --> 12:14.200
to their job listing, you need to be adept at things like number theory, statistics,

12:14.200 --> 12:19.680
probability, algebra, and calculus—all of which you can learn or brush up on with Brilliant.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.920
Each of their courses for each of those subjects is interactive, wonderfully designed, and

12:23.920 --> 12:28.460
helps you learn complex topics like calculus, not through rote memorization, but rather

12:28.460 --> 12:32.880
through breaking down the concepts into small, intuitive chunks and then building it all

12:32.880 --> 12:34.400
back together.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.820
This is how you can truly understand calculus or number theory or statistics, rather than

12:38.820 --> 12:41.540
just learning the process to solve problems.

12:41.540 --> 12:45.440
If math isn't your thing, they also have dozens of amazing other courses on subjects

12:45.440 --> 12:50.060
like scientific thinking, quantum mechanics, computer science, and plenty more.
