00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,900
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,500
McDonalds is everywhere.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,640
In the contiguous United States, the farthest you can get away from one is a spot in the

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,960
Sheldon National Antelope Refuge in Nevada.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,820
Even then, you only have to drive 115 miles to the nearest golden arches.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,200
Around the world, there are more than 36,000 locations in 119 different countries.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,940
One of the defining characteristics of McDonalds is the commitment to consistency across the

15
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,940
brand.

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,980
While there are regional differences to the menu such as kiwi burgers in New Zealand or

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,940
chicken congee in Indonesia, the core menu items such as Big Macs, chicken nuggets, and

18
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,580
fries are always available.

19
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,620
That means that the same items are being made in the same way with the same ingredients

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,740
in very different economies around the world.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,100
Obviously, Big Macs don't cost the same everywhere.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,980
A Big Mac costs on average $4.79 in the US so if you were to charge the equivalent in

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,380
Kenya, $480 shilling, nobody would buy it because that's double the average daily

24
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,380
salary.

25
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,460
It would be like charging $200 for a Big Mac in the US.

26
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,740
That's why McDonalds sets the local price for burgers based on a variety of factors

27
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,100
such as labor costs, rent, ingredient costs, and local income levels.

28
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,260
Now for some real economics.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,340
Purchasing power is the amount of goods you can get for one unit of currency.

30
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,600
Let me explain.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,380
In the US, the average price of a Big Mac across all markets is $4.79.

32
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,580
In Sweden, the cost of a Big Mac is $44 krona.

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,040
$44 krona is equivalent to $5.13.

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,100
That means that in the US, you can get 20.8% of a Big Mac for a dollar while in Sweden

35
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,500
you can only get 19.5% of that burger.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,940
So in terms of the Big Mac, the purchasing power of the US dollar is higher.

37
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,980
You get more bang for your buck.

38
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,420
This also means that the Swedish krona is overvalued in terms of exchange rates by about

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,280
6.1%, at least according to the Big Mac index.

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,600
The Economist magazine first created the index in 1986 as an informal way of comparing

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,320
purchasing power between currencies.

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,140
So now let's look at the numbers.

43
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,760
In Venezuela, the cost of a Big Mac is equivalent to $0.66.

44
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,680
That's the cheapest Big Mac in terms of equivalent US dollars in the world.

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,320
This is largely due to recent currency devaluations and high inflation in the country.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,200
It's possible that the cost of a Venezuelan Big Mac will soon rise in response.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,000
This means that for the cost of one American Big Mac, you could buy seven Venezuelan Big

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Macs.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,040
After Venezuela, the countries with the cheapest Big Macs are Russia, Ukraine, South Africa,

50
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,080
and Malaysia.

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,040
For the other side of the spectrum, the top five most expensive Big Macs come from Switzerland,

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,320
Sweden, Norway, the US, then Denmark.

53
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,240
That's right, the US is home to the fourth most expensive Big Mac in the world.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,760
What's also interesting is to look at how long it takes individuals to earn enough money

55
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
to buy a Big Mac in different cities around the world.

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,560
In Nairobi, Kenya, an average worker would have to rack up 173 minutes on the clock to

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,360
pay for one Big Mac.

58
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,440
Compare that to a worker in Hong Kong who would only have to work for 8.7 minutes for

59
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,960
a burger.

60
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,800
The quickest one can earn a burger in the US is in Miami where the average individual

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,980
would only have to work for 10.7 minutes to pay for a Big Mac.

62
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,960
Now this index isn't perfect.

63
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,040
While the cost of ingredients is pretty similar across all countries since all ingredients

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,340
are held the same standard, the index doesn't account for the wide differences in labor

65
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,080
and land costs.

66
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,280
A burger will cost less to make in India because McDonald's doesn't need to pay as much

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,680
for employees and retail space.

68
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,360
Nevertheless, this index is a great way of teaching some basic economics in a tasty way.

69
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,980
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.
