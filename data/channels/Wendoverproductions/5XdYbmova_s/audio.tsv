0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13380	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13380	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21060	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21060	24900	bit more about our amazing world.
24900	26500	McDonalds is everywhere.
26500	30640	In the contiguous United States, the farthest you can get away from one is a spot in the
30640	33960	Sheldon National Antelope Refuge in Nevada.
33960	38820	Even then, you only have to drive 115 miles to the nearest golden arches.
38820	45200	Around the world, there are more than 36,000 locations in 119 different countries.
45200	49940	One of the defining characteristics of McDonalds is the commitment to consistency across the
49940	50940	brand.
50940	54980	While there are regional differences to the menu such as kiwi burgers in New Zealand or
54980	59940	chicken congee in Indonesia, the core menu items such as Big Macs, chicken nuggets, and
59940	62580	fries are always available.
62580	66620	That means that the same items are being made in the same way with the same ingredients
66620	69740	in very different economies around the world.
69740	73100	Obviously, Big Macs don't cost the same everywhere.
73100	77980	A Big Mac costs on average $4.79 in the US so if you were to charge the equivalent in
77980	83380	Kenya, $480 shilling, nobody would buy it because that's double the average daily
83380	84380	salary.
84380	87460	It would be like charging $200 for a Big Mac in the US.
87460	91740	That's why McDonalds sets the local price for burgers based on a variety of factors
91740	96100	such as labor costs, rent, ingredient costs, and local income levels.
96100	98260	Now for some real economics.
98260	102340	Purchasing power is the amount of goods you can get for one unit of currency.
102340	103600	Let me explain.
103600	108380	In the US, the average price of a Big Mac across all markets is $4.79.
108380	111580	In Sweden, the cost of a Big Mac is $44 krona.
111580	116040	$44 krona is equivalent to $5.13.
116040	121100	That means that in the US, you can get 20.8% of a Big Mac for a dollar while in Sweden
121100	124500	you can only get 19.5% of that burger.
124500	128940	So in terms of the Big Mac, the purchasing power of the US dollar is higher.
128940	130980	You get more bang for your buck.
130980	135420	This also means that the Swedish krona is overvalued in terms of exchange rates by about
135420	139280	6.1%, at least according to the Big Mac index.
139280	144600	The Economist magazine first created the index in 1986 as an informal way of comparing
144600	147320	purchasing power between currencies.
147320	149140	So now let's look at the numbers.
149140	152760	In Venezuela, the cost of a Big Mac is equivalent to $0.66.
152760	157680	That's the cheapest Big Mac in terms of equivalent US dollars in the world.
157680	162320	This is largely due to recent currency devaluations and high inflation in the country.
162320	167200	It's possible that the cost of a Venezuelan Big Mac will soon rise in response.
167200	172000	This means that for the cost of one American Big Mac, you could buy seven Venezuelan Big
172000	173000	Macs.
173000	178040	After Venezuela, the countries with the cheapest Big Macs are Russia, Ukraine, South Africa,
178040	179080	and Malaysia.
179080	184040	For the other side of the spectrum, the top five most expensive Big Macs come from Switzerland,
184040	187320	Sweden, Norway, the US, then Denmark.
187320	192240	That's right, the US is home to the fourth most expensive Big Mac in the world.
192240	196760	What's also interesting is to look at how long it takes individuals to earn enough money
196800	200400	to buy a Big Mac in different cities around the world.
200400	205560	In Nairobi, Kenya, an average worker would have to rack up 173 minutes on the clock to
205560	207360	pay for one Big Mac.
207360	211440	Compare that to a worker in Hong Kong who would only have to work for 8.7 minutes for
211440	212960	a burger.
212960	216800	The quickest one can earn a burger in the US is in Miami where the average individual
216800	220980	would only have to work for 10.7 minutes to pay for a Big Mac.
220980	222960	Now this index isn't perfect.
222960	227040	While the cost of ingredients is pretty similar across all countries since all ingredients
227040	231340	are held the same standard, the index doesn't account for the wide differences in labor
231340	233080	and land costs.
233080	237280	A burger will cost less to make in India because McDonald's doesn't need to pay as much
237280	239680	for employees and retail space.
239680	246360	Nevertheless, this index is a great way of teaching some basic economics in a tasty way.
246360	248980	I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.
