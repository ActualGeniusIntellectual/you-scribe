00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.380
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.380 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.060 --> 00:24.900
bit more about our amazing world.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.500
McDonalds is everywhere.

00:26.500 --> 00:30.640
In the contiguous United States, the farthest you can get away from one is a spot in the

00:30.640 --> 00:33.960
Sheldon National Antelope Refuge in Nevada.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.820
Even then, you only have to drive 115 miles to the nearest golden arches.

00:38.820 --> 00:45.200
Around the world, there are more than 36,000 locations in 119 different countries.

00:45.200 --> 00:49.940
One of the defining characteristics of McDonalds is the commitment to consistency across the

00:49.940 --> 00:50.940
brand.

00:50.940 --> 00:54.980
While there are regional differences to the menu such as kiwi burgers in New Zealand or

00:54.980 --> 00:59.940
chicken congee in Indonesia, the core menu items such as Big Macs, chicken nuggets, and

00:59.940 --> 01:02.580
fries are always available.

01:02.580 --> 01:06.620
That means that the same items are being made in the same way with the same ingredients

01:06.620 --> 01:09.740
in very different economies around the world.

01:09.740 --> 01:13.100
Obviously, Big Macs don't cost the same everywhere.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.980
A Big Mac costs on average $4.79 in the US so if you were to charge the equivalent in

01:17.980 --> 01:23.380
Kenya, $480 shilling, nobody would buy it because that's double the average daily

01:23.380 --> 01:24.380
salary.

01:24.380 --> 01:27.460
It would be like charging $200 for a Big Mac in the US.

01:27.460 --> 01:31.740
That's why McDonalds sets the local price for burgers based on a variety of factors

01:31.740 --> 01:36.100
such as labor costs, rent, ingredient costs, and local income levels.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.260
Now for some real economics.

01:38.260 --> 01:42.340
Purchasing power is the amount of goods you can get for one unit of currency.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.600
Let me explain.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.380
In the US, the average price of a Big Mac across all markets is $4.79.

01:48.380 --> 01:51.580
In Sweden, the cost of a Big Mac is $44 krona.

01:51.580 --> 01:56.040
$44 krona is equivalent to $5.13.

01:56.040 --> 02:01.100
That means that in the US, you can get 20.8% of a Big Mac for a dollar while in Sweden

02:01.100 --> 02:04.500
you can only get 19.5% of that burger.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.940
So in terms of the Big Mac, the purchasing power of the US dollar is higher.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.980
You get more bang for your buck.

02:10.980 --> 02:15.420
This also means that the Swedish krona is overvalued in terms of exchange rates by about

02:15.420 --> 02:19.280
6.1%, at least according to the Big Mac index.

02:19.280 --> 02:24.600
The Economist magazine first created the index in 1986 as an informal way of comparing

02:24.600 --> 02:27.320
purchasing power between currencies.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.140
So now let's look at the numbers.

02:29.140 --> 02:32.760
In Venezuela, the cost of a Big Mac is equivalent to $0.66.

02:32.760 --> 02:37.680
That's the cheapest Big Mac in terms of equivalent US dollars in the world.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.320
This is largely due to recent currency devaluations and high inflation in the country.

02:42.320 --> 02:47.200
It's possible that the cost of a Venezuelan Big Mac will soon rise in response.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.000
This means that for the cost of one American Big Mac, you could buy seven Venezuelan Big

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Macs.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.040
After Venezuela, the countries with the cheapest Big Macs are Russia, Ukraine, South Africa,

02:58.040 --> 02:59.080
and Malaysia.

02:59.080 --> 03:04.040
For the other side of the spectrum, the top five most expensive Big Macs come from Switzerland,

03:04.040 --> 03:07.320
Sweden, Norway, the US, then Denmark.

03:07.320 --> 03:12.240
That's right, the US is home to the fourth most expensive Big Mac in the world.

03:12.240 --> 03:16.760
What's also interesting is to look at how long it takes individuals to earn enough money

03:16.800 --> 03:20.400
to buy a Big Mac in different cities around the world.

03:20.400 --> 03:25.560
In Nairobi, Kenya, an average worker would have to rack up 173 minutes on the clock to

03:25.560 --> 03:27.360
pay for one Big Mac.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.440
Compare that to a worker in Hong Kong who would only have to work for 8.7 minutes for

03:31.440 --> 03:32.960
a burger.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.800
The quickest one can earn a burger in the US is in Miami where the average individual

03:36.800 --> 03:40.980
would only have to work for 10.7 minutes to pay for a Big Mac.

03:40.980 --> 03:42.960
Now this index isn't perfect.

03:42.960 --> 03:47.040
While the cost of ingredients is pretty similar across all countries since all ingredients

03:47.040 --> 03:51.340
are held the same standard, the index doesn't account for the wide differences in labor

03:51.340 --> 03:53.080
and land costs.

03:53.080 --> 03:57.280
A burger will cost less to make in India because McDonald's doesn't need to pay as much

03:57.280 --> 03:59.680
for employees and retail space.

03:59.680 --> 04:06.360
Nevertheless, this index is a great way of teaching some basic economics in a tasty way.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.980
I hope you enjoyed this week's episode.
