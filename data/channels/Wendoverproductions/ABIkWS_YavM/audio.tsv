7740	13160	The global petroleum industry lives and dies by the price of oil.
13160	19480	This number, a gauge of the average amount paid for a barrel, 42 gallons, or 159 liters,
19480	25060	is responsible for enormous shifts in the field—shifts that lead to the rise of some
25060	31300	nations and the fall of others—shifts that change where and how people get their energy.
31300	37180	That's because, just because there's more or less one global price, there are innumerable
37180	42460	different production costs depending on where and how the oil is extracted.
42460	46860	One country's barrel of oil can cost dozens of times more than another's, but then even
46860	50140	within the same country, the costs are not the same.
50140	52460	It's more of a curve.
52460	56220	A given country's cost looks more or less like this.
56220	61100	At a lower level of production, the average overall cost to produce a barrel of oil would
61100	66500	be a certain amount but then, as the total production increases, that average per barrel
66500	71740	cost also increases up until a point where the curve turns into a nearly vertical line
71740	75180	because a country's production capacity has been reached.
75180	79420	This is because oil is found in plenty of different places.
79420	83900	Sometimes it's found under a big empty field near a major road, but sometimes it's found
83900	87880	under thousands of feet of ocean nowhere near the coast.
87880	93640	Between these two, it's pretty easy to understand where it would be more expensive to extract.
93640	98500	On that national cost curve, though, one must also put a horizontal line.
98500	100620	That's the oil price.
100620	106260	If the price is here, then it makes sense to produce up to that amount of oil—anymore,
106260	109980	and a barrel of oil would cost more to produce than what it sells for.
109980	114600	If the oil price moves up, though, then it makes sense to increase production even when
114600	120460	it raises the cost per barrel, and that's what happened for most of the last 50 years.
120460	127460	The oil price rose, with some up and down, from $20 in 1973 to a peak of over $140 in
127460	128460	2008.
128460	133740	Throughout that time, as long as an oil company could find a way to produce a barrel of oil
133740	137980	for less than the current price, they were guaranteed a profit.
137980	142260	That's what brought them from the field to the ocean.
142260	147660	Offshore oil rigs are inherently a higher-cost, higher-risk method of oil extraction, but
147660	152480	the oceans are, of course, home to a huge proportion of the world's oil reserves,
152480	158220	so if there are no more low-cost oil fields on land, that's where the companies go.
158220	162620	Before starting operations, though, these companies need to decide exactly where to
162620	163620	go.
163620	168220	Now, usually, oil platforms are installed where there are already plenty of other platforms
168220	173620	such as in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea—they cluster together.
173620	178440	Within these areas, though, they need to determine which exact spot has the greatest potential
178440	183880	for oil extraction, so geologists conduct surveys using ships and satellite imagery.
183880	188980	Once that spot is selected, a rig will be towed to its location and installed.
188980	194220	Once they're put in location, offshore oil platforms often don't move for years—they're
194220	197860	intended for long-term operation in a single spot.
197860	201620	Despite this, though, they operate quite differently from ships.
201620	206620	Usually, those working onboard have a shift of 12 hours a day, every day, for a period
206620	211180	of two or three weeks, followed by two or three weeks off onshore.
211180	214980	Keeping those work hours dense means that fewer people onboard are not working at a
214980	218220	given time, which means that less space is needed for accommodations.
218220	223940	But, of course, this pattern means that there's quite a lot of back and forth between shore
223940	225100	and rig.
225100	227760	For that, they use helicopters.
227760	232440	This is actually one of the largest commercial applications of helicopters and huge companies
232440	237460	have emerged, especially in the past few decades, to serve offshore oil rigs.
237460	242760	Bristow Aviation, one of the largest, has a fleet of almost 500, mostly used to make
242760	244540	these offshore flights.
244540	249620	The North Sea oilfield is primarily linked with Aberdeen, Scotland onshore, at least
249620	252300	for its UK-owned or operated platforms.
252300	257020	Aberdeen Airport, a primarily regional airport that only has commercial passenger flights
257020	263000	to a couple dozen European destinations, happens to be the world's busiest heliport.
263000	268000	About 100 large helicopters take off from here each day, mostly flying out to the North
268000	269140	Sea.
269140	272720	But Aberdeen is also linked to the oilfields another way.
272720	276320	It serves as a hub for the ships that service the rigs.
276320	281400	Now, especially in the North Sea, oil makes its way from the rigs to shore by undersea
281400	286080	pipeline, so there isn't need to bring much back, but they do need to be frequently replenished
286080	289800	with supplies—both for the humans and the rigs' operations.
289800	294800	That's the job of platform supply vessels, which are essentially mini short-range flexible
294800	296120	cargo ships.
296120	301080	Aberdeen Harbor is always abuzz with activity, filling up these vessels, to keep the hundreds
301080	304240	of offshore platforms themselves supplied.
304240	309080	Onboard, there are essentially three types of jobs—production, those directly involved
309080	313360	with the extraction and processing of oil, maintenance, those who keep the facilities
313360	318280	and equipment in working order, and service, those who cook or clean or care for the rest
318280	319280	of the crew.
319280	323320	There's always a focus, within the companies operating these platforms, to minimize the
323320	327040	numbers of people working actually on board as much as possible.
327400	331740	It's expensive first to transport and supply these workers, and then their salaries are
331740	336560	also considerably higher than typical onshore salaries in the petroleum industry.
336560	342960	An average offshore salary in the UK is around $60,000 or $70,000—nearly double the national
342960	344240	average wage.
344240	348840	Therefore, most management and high-level decisions are made by workers back onshore
348840	352340	who videoconference in to the platforms to coordinate.
352340	356320	Workers on board are, for the most part, strictly operational.
356320	361480	On the inside, these platforms look a lot like ships—the rooms are small and the recreation
361480	363280	areas are sparse.
363280	367540	There isn't, after all, much downtime given the long hours while on board.
367540	372440	The platforms are more or less self-sufficient—even though they're usually within a couple hundred
372440	377680	miles of shore, ships only resupply sporadically, and helicopter flights are expensive, so water
377680	380380	and electricity are produced on board.
380380	384920	As you would imagine, the rigs themselves are also hugely expensive to build.
384920	391540	That's because, what you see, the platform, is only a small component of the overall structure.
391540	396480	With all designs, there's hundreds or thousands of feet of undersea drilling equipment, but
396480	399120	with some, there's far more.
399120	403960	Certain platforms are floating, anchored to the ocean floor, but others are rather massive
403960	405800	undersea towers.
405800	411120	The tallest in existence is the Petronius platform, which has almost 2,000 feet or 600
411120	414800	meters of undersea towering to support the platform itself.
414800	419440	This made it, until the opening of the Burj Khalifa in 2010, the tallest free-standing
419440	421380	structure in the world.
421380	425880	The development, construction, and installation costs of this platform were therefore about
425880	428720	$500 million.
428720	433280	And in fact, those costs are completely typical, if not low.
433280	436600	Plenty of platforms cost far closer to a billion dollars.
436600	443000	So, the question that oil companies are now beginning to pose would be, is it worth it?
443000	448280	Well, there's the short-term answer to that question and there's the long-term answer.
448280	451360	In the short-term, the answer is definitively no.
451360	456480	At the time of writing, in April 2020, oil prices are hovering in the $20s of dollars
456480	461440	per barrel—artificially lowered by a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and naturally
461440	465080	lowered by a drop in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
465080	470000	There likely is not a single offshore oil platform in the world turning a profit at
470000	471500	those prices.
471500	475460	Platforms like the North Sea, which have particularly high costs due to their workforce coming from
475460	480180	relatively high-wage countries like Scotland, England, and Norway, have seen their output
480180	485740	reduced since oil reached a peak price up until 2014—it's just far cheaper to buy
485740	488660	oil from onshore production facilities.
488660	494700	So, in the year of 2020, oil platforms just don't make sense.
494700	499940	In the longer term, though, oil platforms could turn a profit, and that's why they're
499940	500940	kept around.
501380	506340	In a high-price oil environment, there likely isn't enough onshore capacity to fulfill
506340	511260	demand, and so these offshore platforms are how oil companies fulfill demand to increase
511260	512260	profits.
512260	517340	There's much less short-term flexibility with offshore platforms than onshore installations,
517340	522120	so typically the oil platforms are kept running in the medium-term, and then in the short-term
522120	524620	onshore production is scaled more to demand.
524620	529420	But there are long-term costs that oil companies might not have fully previously considered
529780	533760	when offshore production first began at a large scale decades ago.
533760	539180	This was all realized with the BP Deepwater Horizon Platforms explosion and subsequent
539180	546180	oil spill in 2010—almost 5 million barrels spilled out into the Gulf of Mexico.
546180	550860	The full economic and environmental costs are still not fully realized a decade later,
550860	555940	but they certainly far eclipse the costs borne by BP itself, but the company spent about
555940	560340	$65 billion cleaning up and settling claims related to the incident, and their market
560340	565200	value dropped by about $60 billion—that's equivalent to about two to three years of
565200	566200	their profit.
566200	570540	And it's not like the Deepwater Horizon will be the last oil spill.
570540	575320	There might have been reforms, and there might be more attention, but oil spills are just
575320	577520	a byproduct of the business.
577520	582560	The immense cost they impose on both the companies responsible and the areas they alter will
582560	584920	not go away.
584920	590740	Even without considering their immense environmental cost, to the company, oil platforms have emerged
590740	595760	as high-risk, low-reward alternatives to onshore extraction methods.
595760	601140	That's not a desirable combination by itself, and it's coupled with widespread public
601140	603560	sentiment against offshore drilling.
603560	608780	That's a losing combination for everyone, and for that reason, there really hasn't
608780	613080	been any expansion in the industry in the past decade and a half.
613080	617660	The world has been producing about 20 million barrels of oil from offshore sources per day
617660	622800	since about 2005, despite oil demand increasing, and yet there's little evidence that this
622800	626420	will ramp up in the future in a free-market environment.
626420	630860	The only reason it might is if governments artificially prop up this production method
630860	634140	in order to ensure their oil needs are fulfilled domestically.
634140	639260	That's possible in a place like the UK, with vast offshore production but very limited
639260	644760	onshore, but with the recent decline in North Sea oil, it's not a future that oil companies
644760	648100	themselves are likely interested in pursuing.
648100	651260	This isn't some great win for the environment, though.
651260	655780	Onshore extraction is hardly better than offshore, but it does mean that, in the current oil
655780	661720	environment, the makeup of who, how, and where the world gets its energy is changing ever
661720	664320	faster.
664320	668780	The story of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill is a fascinating one, and there's
669300	673100	a great book that goes into immense detail of the saga the workers on the platform went
673100	676500	through to save lives and escape in its first hours.
676500	681700	It's called Fire on the Horizon, and it gives a fantastic glimpse into the perils
681700	683060	of such a job.
