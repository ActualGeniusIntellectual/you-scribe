3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,160
The global petroleum industry lives and dies by the price of oil.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,480
This number, a gauge of the average amount paid for a barrel, 42 gallons, or 159 liters,

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,060
is responsible for enormous shifts in the field—shifts that lead to the rise of some

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:31,300
nations and the fall of others—shifts that change where and how people get their energy.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,180
That's because, just because there's more or less one global price, there are innumerable

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:42,460
different production costs depending on where and how the oil is extracted.

9
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:46,860
One country's barrel of oil can cost dozens of times more than another's, but then even

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,140
within the same country, the costs are not the same.

11
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,460
It's more of a curve.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:56,220
A given country's cost looks more or less like this.

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,100
At a lower level of production, the average overall cost to produce a barrel of oil would

14
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,500
be a certain amount but then, as the total production increases, that average per barrel

15
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:11,740
cost also increases up until a point where the curve turns into a nearly vertical line

16
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,180
because a country's production capacity has been reached.

17
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,420
This is because oil is found in plenty of different places.

18
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:23,900
Sometimes it's found under a big empty field near a major road, but sometimes it's found

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,880
under thousands of feet of ocean nowhere near the coast.

20
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,640
Between these two, it's pretty easy to understand where it would be more expensive to extract.

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,500
On that national cost curve, though, one must also put a horizontal line.

22
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,620
That's the oil price.

23
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,260
If the price is here, then it makes sense to produce up to that amount of oil—anymore,

24
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,980
and a barrel of oil would cost more to produce than what it sells for.

25
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,600
If the oil price moves up, though, then it makes sense to increase production even when

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,460
it raises the cost per barrel, and that's what happened for most of the last 50 years.

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:07,460
The oil price rose, with some up and down, from $20 in 1973 to a peak of over $140 in

28
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,460
2008.

29
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,740
Throughout that time, as long as an oil company could find a way to produce a barrel of oil

30
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,980
for less than the current price, they were guaranteed a profit.

31
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,260
That's what brought them from the field to the ocean.

32
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,660
Offshore oil rigs are inherently a higher-cost, higher-risk method of oil extraction, but

33
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:32,480
the oceans are, of course, home to a huge proportion of the world's oil reserves,

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,220
so if there are no more low-cost oil fields on land, that's where the companies go.

35
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,620
Before starting operations, though, these companies need to decide exactly where to

36
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
go.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,220
Now, usually, oil platforms are installed where there are already plenty of other platforms

38
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,620
such as in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea—they cluster together.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,440
Within these areas, though, they need to determine which exact spot has the greatest potential

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,880
for oil extraction, so geologists conduct surveys using ships and satellite imagery.

41
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,980
Once that spot is selected, a rig will be towed to its location and installed.

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,220
Once they're put in location, offshore oil platforms often don't move for years—they're

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,860
intended for long-term operation in a single spot.

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,620
Despite this, though, they operate quite differently from ships.

45
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,620
Usually, those working onboard have a shift of 12 hours a day, every day, for a period

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,180
of two or three weeks, followed by two or three weeks off onshore.

47
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,980
Keeping those work hours dense means that fewer people onboard are not working at a

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,220
given time, which means that less space is needed for accommodations.

49
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,940
But, of course, this pattern means that there's quite a lot of back and forth between shore

50
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,100
and rig.

51
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,760
For that, they use helicopters.

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,440
This is actually one of the largest commercial applications of helicopters and huge companies

53
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,460
have emerged, especially in the past few decades, to serve offshore oil rigs.

54
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:02,760
Bristow Aviation, one of the largest, has a fleet of almost 500, mostly used to make

55
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,540
these offshore flights.

56
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,620
The North Sea oilfield is primarily linked with Aberdeen, Scotland onshore, at least

57
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,300
for its UK-owned or operated platforms.

58
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,020
Aberdeen Airport, a primarily regional airport that only has commercial passenger flights

59
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:23,000
to a couple dozen European destinations, happens to be the world's busiest heliport.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
About 100 large helicopters take off from here each day, mostly flying out to the North

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,140
Sea.

62
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,720
But Aberdeen is also linked to the oilfields another way.

63
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,320
It serves as a hub for the ships that service the rigs.

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,400
Now, especially in the North Sea, oil makes its way from the rigs to shore by undersea

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,080
pipeline, so there isn't need to bring much back, but they do need to be frequently replenished

66
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,800
with supplies—both for the humans and the rigs' operations.

67
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,800
That's the job of platform supply vessels, which are essentially mini short-range flexible

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
cargo ships.

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Aberdeen Harbor is always abuzz with activity, filling up these vessels, to keep the hundreds

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,240
of offshore platforms themselves supplied.

71
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,080
Onboard, there are essentially three types of jobs—production, those directly involved

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,360
with the extraction and processing of oil, maintenance, those who keep the facilities

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,280
and equipment in working order, and service, those who cook or clean or care for the rest

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
of the crew.

75
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,320
There's always a focus, within the companies operating these platforms, to minimize the

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,040
numbers of people working actually on board as much as possible.

77
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,740
It's expensive first to transport and supply these workers, and then their salaries are

78
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:36,560
also considerably higher than typical onshore salaries in the petroleum industry.

79
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,960
An average offshore salary in the UK is around $60,000 or $70,000—nearly double the national

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,240
average wage.

81
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,840
Therefore, most management and high-level decisions are made by workers back onshore

82
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,340
who videoconference in to the platforms to coordinate.

83
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,320
Workers on board are, for the most part, strictly operational.

84
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,480
On the inside, these platforms look a lot like ships—the rooms are small and the recreation

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,280
areas are sparse.

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,540
There isn't, after all, much downtime given the long hours while on board.

87
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,440
The platforms are more or less self-sufficient—even though they're usually within a couple hundred

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,680
miles of shore, ships only resupply sporadically, and helicopter flights are expensive, so water

89
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,380
and electricity are produced on board.

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,920
As you would imagine, the rigs themselves are also hugely expensive to build.

91
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,540
That's because, what you see, the platform, is only a small component of the overall structure.

92
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,480
With all designs, there's hundreds or thousands of feet of undersea drilling equipment, but

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,120
with some, there's far more.

94
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,960
Certain platforms are floating, anchored to the ocean floor, but others are rather massive

95
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,800
undersea towers.

96
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,120
The tallest in existence is the Petronius platform, which has almost 2,000 feet or 600

97
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
meters of undersea towering to support the platform itself.

98
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,440
This made it, until the opening of the Burj Khalifa in 2010, the tallest free-standing

99
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,380
structure in the world.

100
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,880
The development, construction, and installation costs of this platform were therefore about

101
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,720
$500 million.

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
And in fact, those costs are completely typical, if not low.

103
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,600
Plenty of platforms cost far closer to a billion dollars.

104
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:23,000
So, the question that oil companies are now beginning to pose would be, is it worth it?

105
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,280
Well, there's the short-term answer to that question and there's the long-term answer.

106
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,360
In the short-term, the answer is definitively no.

107
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,480
At the time of writing, in April 2020, oil prices are hovering in the $20s of dollars

108
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,440
per barrel—artificially lowered by a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and naturally

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,080
lowered by a drop in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

110
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,000
There likely is not a single offshore oil platform in the world turning a profit at

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,500
those prices.

112
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,460
Platforms like the North Sea, which have particularly high costs due to their workforce coming from

113
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,180
relatively high-wage countries like Scotland, England, and Norway, have seen their output

114
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,740
reduced since oil reached a peak price up until 2014—it's just far cheaper to buy

115
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,660
oil from onshore production facilities.

116
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,700
So, in the year of 2020, oil platforms just don't make sense.

117
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,940
In the longer term, though, oil platforms could turn a profit, and that's why they're

118
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
kept around.

119
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,340
In a high-price oil environment, there likely isn't enough onshore capacity to fulfill

120
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,260
demand, and so these offshore platforms are how oil companies fulfill demand to increase

121
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
profits.

122
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,340
There's much less short-term flexibility with offshore platforms than onshore installations,

123
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,120
so typically the oil platforms are kept running in the medium-term, and then in the short-term

124
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,620
onshore production is scaled more to demand.

125
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,420
But there are long-term costs that oil companies might not have fully previously considered

126
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,760
when offshore production first began at a large scale decades ago.

127
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,180
This was all realized with the BP Deepwater Horizon Platforms explosion and subsequent

128
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,180
oil spill in 2010—almost 5 million barrels spilled out into the Gulf of Mexico.

129
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,860
The full economic and environmental costs are still not fully realized a decade later,

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,940
but they certainly far eclipse the costs borne by BP itself, but the company spent about

131
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,340
$65 billion cleaning up and settling claims related to the incident, and their market

132
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:25,200
value dropped by about $60 billion—that's equivalent to about two to three years of

133
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
their profit.

134
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,540
And it's not like the Deepwater Horizon will be the last oil spill.

135
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,320
There might have been reforms, and there might be more attention, but oil spills are just

136
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,520
a byproduct of the business.

137
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,560
The immense cost they impose on both the companies responsible and the areas they alter will

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,920
not go away.

139
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,740
Even without considering their immense environmental cost, to the company, oil platforms have emerged

140
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,760
as high-risk, low-reward alternatives to onshore extraction methods.

141
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,140
That's not a desirable combination by itself, and it's coupled with widespread public

142
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,560
sentiment against offshore drilling.

143
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,780
That's a losing combination for everyone, and for that reason, there really hasn't

144
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,080
been any expansion in the industry in the past decade and a half.

145
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,660
The world has been producing about 20 million barrels of oil from offshore sources per day

146
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,800
since about 2005, despite oil demand increasing, and yet there's little evidence that this

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,420
will ramp up in the future in a free-market environment.

148
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,860
The only reason it might is if governments artificially prop up this production method

149
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,140
in order to ensure their oil needs are fulfilled domestically.

150
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,260
That's possible in a place like the UK, with vast offshore production but very limited

151
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:44,760
onshore, but with the recent decline in North Sea oil, it's not a future that oil companies

152
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,100
themselves are likely interested in pursuing.

153
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,260
This isn't some great win for the environment, though.

154
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,780
Onshore extraction is hardly better than offshore, but it does mean that, in the current oil

155
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,720
environment, the makeup of who, how, and where the world gets its energy is changing ever

156
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,320
faster.

157
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,780
The story of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill is a fascinating one, and there's

158
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,100
a great book that goes into immense detail of the saga the workers on the platform went

159
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,500
through to save lives and escape in its first hours.

160
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,700
It's called Fire on the Horizon, and it gives a fantastic glimpse into the perils

161
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,060
of such a job.

162
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:28,120
Like many great stories, it is available as an audiobook on Audible, so that means that,

163
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,680
by signing up for a trial at audible.com slash wendover or by texting wendover to 500-500,

164
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,780
you can get it for free.

165
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,220
If that doesn't sound like your thing, though, and you're a sci-fi fan like me,

166
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,500
I would wholeheartedly recommend Recursion by Blake Crouch.

167
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,900
It's a terrifically unique story, and its performance on Audible is fantastic.

168
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:53,720
So, once again, by signing up at audible.com slash wendover, you can get Recursion, Fire

169
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:59,020
on the Horizon, or any audiobook for free plus Audible Originals, and you'll be supporting

170
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,220
Wendover Productions while you're at it.
