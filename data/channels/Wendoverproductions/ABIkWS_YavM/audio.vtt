00:07.740 --> 00:13.160
The global petroleum industry lives and dies by the price of oil.

00:13.160 --> 00:19.480
This number, a gauge of the average amount paid for a barrel, 42 gallons, or 159 liters,

00:19.480 --> 00:25.060
is responsible for enormous shifts in the field—shifts that lead to the rise of some

00:25.060 --> 00:31.300
nations and the fall of others—shifts that change where and how people get their energy.

00:31.300 --> 00:37.180
That's because, just because there's more or less one global price, there are innumerable

00:37.180 --> 00:42.460
different production costs depending on where and how the oil is extracted.

00:42.460 --> 00:46.860
One country's barrel of oil can cost dozens of times more than another's, but then even

00:46.860 --> 00:50.140
within the same country, the costs are not the same.

00:50.140 --> 00:52.460
It's more of a curve.

00:52.460 --> 00:56.220
A given country's cost looks more or less like this.

00:56.220 --> 01:01.100
At a lower level of production, the average overall cost to produce a barrel of oil would

01:01.100 --> 01:06.500
be a certain amount but then, as the total production increases, that average per barrel

01:06.500 --> 01:11.740
cost also increases up until a point where the curve turns into a nearly vertical line

01:11.740 --> 01:15.180
because a country's production capacity has been reached.

01:15.180 --> 01:19.420
This is because oil is found in plenty of different places.

01:19.420 --> 01:23.900
Sometimes it's found under a big empty field near a major road, but sometimes it's found

01:23.900 --> 01:27.880
under thousands of feet of ocean nowhere near the coast.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.640
Between these two, it's pretty easy to understand where it would be more expensive to extract.

01:33.640 --> 01:38.500
On that national cost curve, though, one must also put a horizontal line.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.620
That's the oil price.

01:40.620 --> 01:46.260
If the price is here, then it makes sense to produce up to that amount of oil—anymore,

01:46.260 --> 01:49.980
and a barrel of oil would cost more to produce than what it sells for.

01:49.980 --> 01:54.600
If the oil price moves up, though, then it makes sense to increase production even when

01:54.600 --> 02:00.460
it raises the cost per barrel, and that's what happened for most of the last 50 years.

02:00.460 --> 02:07.460
The oil price rose, with some up and down, from $20 in 1973 to a peak of over $140 in

02:07.460 --> 02:08.460
2008.

02:08.460 --> 02:13.740
Throughout that time, as long as an oil company could find a way to produce a barrel of oil

02:13.740 --> 02:17.980
for less than the current price, they were guaranteed a profit.

02:17.980 --> 02:22.260
That's what brought them from the field to the ocean.

02:22.260 --> 02:27.660
Offshore oil rigs are inherently a higher-cost, higher-risk method of oil extraction, but

02:27.660 --> 02:32.480
the oceans are, of course, home to a huge proportion of the world's oil reserves,

02:32.480 --> 02:38.220
so if there are no more low-cost oil fields on land, that's where the companies go.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.620
Before starting operations, though, these companies need to decide exactly where to

02:42.620 --> 02:43.620
go.

02:43.620 --> 02:48.220
Now, usually, oil platforms are installed where there are already plenty of other platforms

02:48.220 --> 02:53.620
such as in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico, or the North Sea—they cluster together.

02:53.620 --> 02:58.440
Within these areas, though, they need to determine which exact spot has the greatest potential

02:58.440 --> 03:03.880
for oil extraction, so geologists conduct surveys using ships and satellite imagery.

03:03.880 --> 03:08.980
Once that spot is selected, a rig will be towed to its location and installed.

03:08.980 --> 03:14.220
Once they're put in location, offshore oil platforms often don't move for years—they're

03:14.220 --> 03:17.860
intended for long-term operation in a single spot.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.620
Despite this, though, they operate quite differently from ships.

03:21.620 --> 03:26.620
Usually, those working onboard have a shift of 12 hours a day, every day, for a period

03:26.620 --> 03:31.180
of two or three weeks, followed by two or three weeks off onshore.

03:31.180 --> 03:34.980
Keeping those work hours dense means that fewer people onboard are not working at a

03:34.980 --> 03:38.220
given time, which means that less space is needed for accommodations.

03:38.220 --> 03:43.940
But, of course, this pattern means that there's quite a lot of back and forth between shore

03:43.940 --> 03:45.100
and rig.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.760
For that, they use helicopters.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.440
This is actually one of the largest commercial applications of helicopters and huge companies

03:52.440 --> 03:57.460
have emerged, especially in the past few decades, to serve offshore oil rigs.

03:57.460 --> 04:02.760
Bristow Aviation, one of the largest, has a fleet of almost 500, mostly used to make

04:02.760 --> 04:04.540
these offshore flights.

04:04.540 --> 04:09.620
The North Sea oilfield is primarily linked with Aberdeen, Scotland onshore, at least

04:09.620 --> 04:12.300
for its UK-owned or operated platforms.

04:12.300 --> 04:17.020
Aberdeen Airport, a primarily regional airport that only has commercial passenger flights

04:17.020 --> 04:23.000
to a couple dozen European destinations, happens to be the world's busiest heliport.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
About 100 large helicopters take off from here each day, mostly flying out to the North

04:28.000 --> 04:29.140
Sea.

04:29.140 --> 04:32.720
But Aberdeen is also linked to the oilfields another way.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.320
It serves as a hub for the ships that service the rigs.

04:36.320 --> 04:41.400
Now, especially in the North Sea, oil makes its way from the rigs to shore by undersea

04:41.400 --> 04:46.080
pipeline, so there isn't need to bring much back, but they do need to be frequently replenished

04:46.080 --> 04:49.800
with supplies—both for the humans and the rigs' operations.

04:49.800 --> 04:54.800
That's the job of platform supply vessels, which are essentially mini short-range flexible

04:54.800 --> 04:56.120
cargo ships.

04:56.120 --> 05:01.080
Aberdeen Harbor is always abuzz with activity, filling up these vessels, to keep the hundreds

05:01.080 --> 05:04.240
of offshore platforms themselves supplied.

05:04.240 --> 05:09.080
Onboard, there are essentially three types of jobs—production, those directly involved

05:09.080 --> 05:13.360
with the extraction and processing of oil, maintenance, those who keep the facilities

05:13.360 --> 05:18.280
and equipment in working order, and service, those who cook or clean or care for the rest

05:18.280 --> 05:19.280
of the crew.

05:19.280 --> 05:23.320
There's always a focus, within the companies operating these platforms, to minimize the

05:23.320 --> 05:27.040
numbers of people working actually on board as much as possible.

05:27.400 --> 05:31.740
It's expensive first to transport and supply these workers, and then their salaries are

05:31.740 --> 05:36.560
also considerably higher than typical onshore salaries in the petroleum industry.

05:36.560 --> 05:42.960
An average offshore salary in the UK is around $60,000 or $70,000—nearly double the national

05:42.960 --> 05:44.240
average wage.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.840
Therefore, most management and high-level decisions are made by workers back onshore

05:48.840 --> 05:52.340
who videoconference in to the platforms to coordinate.

05:52.340 --> 05:56.320
Workers on board are, for the most part, strictly operational.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.480
On the inside, these platforms look a lot like ships—the rooms are small and the recreation

06:01.480 --> 06:03.280
areas are sparse.

06:03.280 --> 06:07.540
There isn't, after all, much downtime given the long hours while on board.

06:07.540 --> 06:12.440
The platforms are more or less self-sufficient—even though they're usually within a couple hundred

06:12.440 --> 06:17.680
miles of shore, ships only resupply sporadically, and helicopter flights are expensive, so water

06:17.680 --> 06:20.380
and electricity are produced on board.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.920
As you would imagine, the rigs themselves are also hugely expensive to build.

06:24.920 --> 06:31.540
That's because, what you see, the platform, is only a small component of the overall structure.

06:31.540 --> 06:36.480
With all designs, there's hundreds or thousands of feet of undersea drilling equipment, but

06:36.480 --> 06:39.120
with some, there's far more.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.960
Certain platforms are floating, anchored to the ocean floor, but others are rather massive

06:43.960 --> 06:45.800
undersea towers.

06:45.800 --> 06:51.120
The tallest in existence is the Petronius platform, which has almost 2,000 feet or 600

06:51.120 --> 06:54.800
meters of undersea towering to support the platform itself.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.440
This made it, until the opening of the Burj Khalifa in 2010, the tallest free-standing

06:59.440 --> 07:01.380
structure in the world.

07:01.380 --> 07:05.880
The development, construction, and installation costs of this platform were therefore about

07:05.880 --> 07:08.720
$500 million.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.280
And in fact, those costs are completely typical, if not low.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.600
Plenty of platforms cost far closer to a billion dollars.

07:16.600 --> 07:23.000
So, the question that oil companies are now beginning to pose would be, is it worth it?

07:23.000 --> 07:28.280
Well, there's the short-term answer to that question and there's the long-term answer.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.360
In the short-term, the answer is definitively no.

07:31.360 --> 07:36.480
At the time of writing, in April 2020, oil prices are hovering in the $20s of dollars

07:36.480 --> 07:41.440
per barrel—artificially lowered by a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and naturally

07:41.440 --> 07:45.080
lowered by a drop in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

07:45.080 --> 07:50.000
There likely is not a single offshore oil platform in the world turning a profit at

07:50.000 --> 07:51.500
those prices.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.460
Platforms like the North Sea, which have particularly high costs due to their workforce coming from

07:55.460 --> 08:00.180
relatively high-wage countries like Scotland, England, and Norway, have seen their output

08:00.180 --> 08:05.740
reduced since oil reached a peak price up until 2014—it's just far cheaper to buy

08:05.740 --> 08:08.660
oil from onshore production facilities.

08:08.660 --> 08:14.700
So, in the year of 2020, oil platforms just don't make sense.

08:14.700 --> 08:19.940
In the longer term, though, oil platforms could turn a profit, and that's why they're

08:19.940 --> 08:20.940
kept around.

08:21.380 --> 08:26.340
In a high-price oil environment, there likely isn't enough onshore capacity to fulfill

08:26.340 --> 08:31.260
demand, and so these offshore platforms are how oil companies fulfill demand to increase

08:31.260 --> 08:32.260
profits.

08:32.260 --> 08:37.340
There's much less short-term flexibility with offshore platforms than onshore installations,

08:37.340 --> 08:42.120
so typically the oil platforms are kept running in the medium-term, and then in the short-term

08:42.120 --> 08:44.620
onshore production is scaled more to demand.

08:44.620 --> 08:49.420
But there are long-term costs that oil companies might not have fully previously considered

08:49.780 --> 08:53.760
when offshore production first began at a large scale decades ago.

08:53.760 --> 08:59.180
This was all realized with the BP Deepwater Horizon Platforms explosion and subsequent

08:59.180 --> 09:06.180
oil spill in 2010—almost 5 million barrels spilled out into the Gulf of Mexico.

09:06.180 --> 09:10.860
The full economic and environmental costs are still not fully realized a decade later,

09:10.860 --> 09:15.940
but they certainly far eclipse the costs borne by BP itself, but the company spent about

09:15.940 --> 09:20.340
$65 billion cleaning up and settling claims related to the incident, and their market

09:20.340 --> 09:25.200
value dropped by about $60 billion—that's equivalent to about two to three years of

09:25.200 --> 09:26.200
their profit.

09:26.200 --> 09:30.540
And it's not like the Deepwater Horizon will be the last oil spill.

09:30.540 --> 09:35.320
There might have been reforms, and there might be more attention, but oil spills are just

09:35.320 --> 09:37.520
a byproduct of the business.

09:37.520 --> 09:42.560
The immense cost they impose on both the companies responsible and the areas they alter will

09:42.560 --> 09:44.920
not go away.

09:44.920 --> 09:50.740
Even without considering their immense environmental cost, to the company, oil platforms have emerged

09:50.740 --> 09:55.760
as high-risk, low-reward alternatives to onshore extraction methods.

09:55.760 --> 10:01.140
That's not a desirable combination by itself, and it's coupled with widespread public

10:01.140 --> 10:03.560
sentiment against offshore drilling.

10:03.560 --> 10:08.780
That's a losing combination for everyone, and for that reason, there really hasn't

10:08.780 --> 10:13.080
been any expansion in the industry in the past decade and a half.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.660
The world has been producing about 20 million barrels of oil from offshore sources per day

10:17.660 --> 10:22.800
since about 2005, despite oil demand increasing, and yet there's little evidence that this

10:22.800 --> 10:26.420
will ramp up in the future in a free-market environment.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.860
The only reason it might is if governments artificially prop up this production method

10:30.860 --> 10:34.140
in order to ensure their oil needs are fulfilled domestically.

10:34.140 --> 10:39.260
That's possible in a place like the UK, with vast offshore production but very limited

10:39.260 --> 10:44.760
onshore, but with the recent decline in North Sea oil, it's not a future that oil companies

10:44.760 --> 10:48.100
themselves are likely interested in pursuing.

10:48.100 --> 10:51.260
This isn't some great win for the environment, though.

10:51.260 --> 10:55.780
Onshore extraction is hardly better than offshore, but it does mean that, in the current oil

10:55.780 --> 11:01.720
environment, the makeup of who, how, and where the world gets its energy is changing ever

11:01.720 --> 11:04.320
faster.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.780
The story of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill is a fascinating one, and there's

11:09.300 --> 11:13.100
a great book that goes into immense detail of the saga the workers on the platform went

11:13.100 --> 11:16.500
through to save lives and escape in its first hours.

11:16.500 --> 11:21.700
It's called Fire on the Horizon, and it gives a fantastic glimpse into the perils

11:21.700 --> 11:23.060
of such a job.

11:23.060 --> 11:28.120
Like many great stories, it is available as an audiobook on Audible, so that means that,
