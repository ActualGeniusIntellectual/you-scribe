1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,220
Last year, for the first time ever, the public got a glimpse into the financials of airline-frequent

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,940
flyer programs.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,800
What they saw was truly astonishing.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,300
During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines were hemorrhaging money and so, naturally,

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,180
they looked for a loan.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,500
United, for example, sought $5 billion to tide the company over until travel came back,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,860
but like with any loan, they needed to put up collateral.

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,620
They needed to offer something to the bank that it would acquire if the company failed

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,400
to pay the loan back.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,020
The problem was, United wasn't worth much at the time since, of course, it was hemorrhaging

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,700
money, meaning it would have had to offer a huge chunk of itself as collateral.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,820
Rather, they decided to offer one of their subsidiaries as collateral—Mileage Plus

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,280
Holdings LLC—essentially, their loyalty program.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,420
Of course, given that United is a publicly traded company, they have various financial

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,040
reporting requirements, including the obligation to file a Form 8-K with the Securities and

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,520
Exchange Commission whenever a major business event takes place, such as taking out a multi-billion

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,660
dollar loan.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,720
Of thousands, one line on this document stood out, quote, "'Multiplying Mileage Plus

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,700
Holdings' 2019 EBITDA by a factor of 12 equates to a Mileage Plus valuation of approximately

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,740
$21.9 billion.'

21
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,740
$21.9 billion.

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,700
That's the value of United's loyalty program, according to the company, and this loan."

23
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,900
Similar financial disclosures from Delta and American Airlines pegged the value of their

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:42,780
loyalty programs at $26 billion and $19.5 to $31.5 billion, respectively.

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,980
So, notwithstanding their size, why did these numbers turn heads?

26
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,720
Well, because of these—the airlines' market caps.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,400
These figures equal the total value of all the shares in each company—it's essentially

28
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,820
a real-time indicator of what Wall Street considers a company worth, given the ebbs

29
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,980
and flows in stock prices.

30
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:10,520
At the time, United's was $10 billion, Delta's $20 billion, and American's $6 billion.

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,700
So, the value of each airline is less than the value of their loyalty programs, which

32
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,160
is interesting in and of itself, but the airlines own their loyalty programs.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,120
Therefore, at least according to Wall Street, airlines themselves are worthless.

34
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
In fact, they're more than worthless—they have negative value, they're loss leaders,

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,980
and the only thing imparting each airline with value is its loyalty program.

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,200
This is a less absurd proposition than it might initially seem.

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,000
In 2018, well before the COVID-induced travel downturn, American Airlines earned about $0.1442

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,440
in passenger revenue per seat per mile flown, but simultaneously, it cost them $0.1485 to

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,040
operate a given seat one mile—so the airline actually lost about half a cent for each mile

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,020
it flew each seat.

41
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,920
The company, however, earned $1.9 billion in pre-tax profits, thanks exclusively to

42
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,040
their $4.2 billion in frequent flyer program revenue.

43
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,360
In the US, airports are plastered with ads for co-branded airline credit cards touting

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,600
free checked bags and other benefits, there's stuff with lounges accessible to frequent

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,960
flyers but not even first-class passengers, they're littered with priority lanes reserved

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,220
for getting elite status members through security and onto planes more quickly, airlines even

47
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,140
have their flight attendants acting as salespeople, reciting credit card pitches at 30,000 feet

48
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,640
in exchange for the chance of a commission on a passenger's sign-up.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,240
The reason why the entire flying process in the US, and increasingly other countries,

50
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,700
seems like a carefully manicured experience nudging you to sign up for credit cards and

51
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,980
frequent flyer programs is because of these numbers.

52
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,920
Airlines are hardly transportation companies anymore.

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,800
Over the past 40 years, they have crafted a system so effective, so unbelievably advantageous

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,280
to their own interests, that they are now willing to lose money flying to prop up their

55
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,240
frequent flyer businesses—businesses whose core proposition is giving away free flights.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,720
Today, airlines are basically banks.

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,940
This all snowballed from a concept no different than the loyalty punch card at your favorite

58
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,560
sandwich place—you fly a certain number of times, you get a free flight.

59
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,440
While airlines had already started tracking the activity of individual flyers, formal

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,800
frequent flyer programs became technically and legally possible with the deregulation

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,880
of the American airline industry in 1978.

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,260
The first program was set up by a small airline called Texas International, which later merged

63
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,760
with Continental, but the first major long-haul airline to do so was American Airlines in

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
1981.

65
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:53,100
What the airline observed was not surprising—American Advantage members were more likely to choose

66
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,480
to fly with American so that they could accumulate enough miles to get a free flight.

67
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,640
In fact, they were even willing to pay slightly more—some 5% extra for an American flight

68
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,840
rather than an equivalent United flight, for example—since that United flight wouldn't

69
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,200
get them any closer to a free American flight.

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,760
It's all sunk cost fallacy—if someone's earned 10,000 Advantage miles, they'd prefer

71
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,460
to fly American and get to the 12,500th for a free flight rather than starting from zero

72
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,720
with United, even if they'd earn the same number of miles.

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Overall, the program certainly did have an expense for the airline, but it quickly became

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,320
clear that the expense was far eclipsed by the additional revenue it brought in.

75
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,980
But more significant than the program's launch was its first evolution beyond the

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,800
sandwich shop punch card.

77
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,700
In 1982, American partnered with Hertz and Holland America to allow its members to earn

78
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,200
points when renting cars or booking cruises, but the concept of earning points with partners

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,960
was not what was revolutionary about this.

80
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,480
Rather, it was the behind-the-scenes mechanics that made that possible.

81
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,920
American wasn't going to give miles away for free when people spent money at another

82
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,240
company because the redemption of miles did have a cost for the airline—beyond small

83
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
variable costs like food, fuel, insurance, and more.

84
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,880
There is potentially significant opportunity cost from offering a seat in exchange for

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,840
points if that seat might have otherwise been booked by a paying passenger.

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,680
Therefore, American needed to be compensated for the miles it gave to Hertz and Holland

87
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:21,880
America, and so, for the first time, it put a real monetary price on its imaginary points.

88
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,960
While the actual numbers are closely guarded secrets, American Airlines would, for example,

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
sell one point to Hertz for one cent, which Hertz would then reward to its customers in

90
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,680
order to incentivize them to rent at Hertz, rather than another rental car company that

91
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,400
did not reward airline points.

92
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,580
Now, if Hertz paid that one cent per mile, which is within the range of educated estimates,

93
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,460
and if a customer redeemed 25,000 miles for a domestic flight, which was a typical redemption

94
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,600
rate at the time, that means American would have earned $250 for a domestic flight.

95
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,360
Considering the typical variable cost for a domestic flight was about $15, American

96
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
Airlines quickly recognized just how incredible the profit opportunities could be.

97
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,080
They started to realize them in 1987, when American teamed up with Citibank to offer

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,620
a co-branded credit card.

99
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,720
That way, for every dollar spent on the card, the member would earn a point.

100
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,680
This dramatically increased the volume at which American and other airlines sold points

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,280
to external partners, and shifted these programs from ways to incentivize more spending on

102
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,600
airfare to profit centers in and of themselves.

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,240
Today, part of the strength of these multi-billion dollar programs is based on the fact that,

104
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,840
despite their strength, government and businesses essentially treat them the same as that sandwich

105
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,340
shop punch card.

106
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,200
To start with, almost universally, points are not taxed.

107
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,640
Despite the fact that one can accumulate points like income and redeem them for something

108
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,760
worth money, governments consider it a rebate, or cash back on your purchase, because to

109
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,640
get that reward, you had to spend money, and you can't exchange that reward for money,

110
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,040
at least officially.

111
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,760
Just as you don't pay tax on the amount saved when bananas are 25% off at the grocery

112
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,960
store, you don't pay tax when the airline awards you points you can use for free flights—in

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,400
this case, the savings just happen further away from purchase.

114
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,640
However, unlike with sandwich punch cards or banana discounts, in this case, the people

115
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,680
paying for the flights are often different than those receiving the reward.

116
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,240
Almost all of airlines' most frequent flyers travel on business, in which case their employers

117
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
pay the airfare.

118
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,440
Despite that, frequent flyer programs award points to the individual flying, not the individual

119
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,440
paying.

120
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,680
In addition, if the employee books the trip on their company card, they also get the credit

121
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,420
card points from that spent.

122
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,580
The company's paying don't really have a problem with this, because it essentially

123
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,660
acts as a free, tax-free benefit for their employees.

124
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,340
Business travel isn't anywhere as glamorous as it used to be, so companies are happy to

125
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,620
allow their employees to earn points they can eventually use for leisure travel, in

126
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,460
exchange for them getting out on the road and making money.

127
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,260
Of course, this potentially creates a scenario in which the individual is incentivized to

128
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,500
fly or pay more on the company's dime, but most don't seem too worried about this.

129
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,080
So, both tax law and company policy, or the lack of it, works in favor of the airline.

130
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,520
The way in which frequent flyer programs were set up wasn't perfect, though—there was

131
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,480
potential for exploits.

132
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,160
Namely, as airline revenue management systems became more complex, price and travel distance

133
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,360
became less and less correlated.

134
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,840
Nowadays, it's rather intuitive to us that the 400-mile flight from DC to Nantucket,

135
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,840
a high-end vacation destination, is going to cost more than the 400-mile flight from

136
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
DC to Boston.

137
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,160
In fact, American's lowest price for that Nantucket flight is $98, while its flights

138
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,520
to Boston start at just $49.

139
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,560
So, it's double the price for the same distance, simply because the more wealthy travelers

140
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,160
headed to Nantucket are more likely to pay for the convenience of a non-stop flight.

141
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,840
Meanwhile, based on the traditional one-mile, one-point system, the member would still gain

142
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,320
just 400 points for each of those flights despite the difference in price.

143
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,840
Therefore, if someone found an itinerary that was low cost but long distance, their

144
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,480
mileage earning could be so high that the miles earned would be worth more than the

145
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,200
cost of the flight.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,800
For example, if one found an itinerary from Los Angeles to San Francisco via Chicago,

147
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,080
the traveler would earn ten times the points than if they flew direct, and more complex

148
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,480
revenue management systems would likely price that long, circuitous connecting itinerary

149
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,320
lower than the non-stop one since it was less convenient.

150
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,040
All around, this was bad for airlines—it was incentivizing people to take longer, multi-stop

151
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,360
itineraries, which cost the airline more to operate, and it forced them to give out more

152
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,280
miles, which cost the airline more in redemptions.

153
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:47,640
In short, they were incentivizing against their own interests.

154
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,960
This was a rare element of the system that did not work in their favor.

155
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,680
So, they changed it.

156
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,680
Over the past decade, nearly every major program has pivoted to a system where passengers are

157
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,320
rewarded points based on how many dollars they spend, rather than how many miles they

158
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
fly.

159
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,840
Among the big three American airlines, it's simple—you spend one dollar, you earn five

160
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,840
points.

161
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,180
This shifted the system from one where the airline wins overall, but might lose out from

162
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,520
time to time, to one where the airline quite literally cannot lose.

163
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,320
At least on the earnings side, revenue-based systems cannot be exploited.

164
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,160
But airlines quickly figured out how to restructure the redemption side in their favor, too.

165
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,560
It used to be that any economy-class flight within the continental US cost 12,500 points

166
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,760
ununited, regardless of whether it was a Tuesday in February or the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

167
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,240
That's despite the fact that cash rates were undoubtedly far higher on the Sunday

168
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,120
after Thanksgiving—one of the highest demand travel days of the year.

169
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,880
While availability of point seats differed, that meant that someone who did manage to

170
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,180
score Thanksgiving Sunday booking on points got a deal.

171
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,260
The cost for the airline to offer that seat on points was greater than what the airline

172
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
earned.

173
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,340
That's since the opportunity cost on those highest demand days is huge, as almost every

174
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,480
available seat is likely to be sold for cash.

175
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,020
Even if it all worked out in the end in the airline's favor, they didn't like these

176
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,340
losses, so they switched the way redemptions worked, too.

177
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,340
Now, nearly every major airline has dynamic award charts.

178
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:23,700
Just like how cash fares rise for high demand days, so too do point redemption rates.

179
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:30,180
For example, in October 2022, United is charging $114 for non-stop Newark to Denver flights

180
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,580
on low-demand Tuesdays, and $254 on high-demand Sundays.

181
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:42,260
Meanwhile, mile redemption rates rise from 8,300 to 22,200 points.

182
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,480
That roughly two-and-a-half times rise for each means that mile rates are now correlated

183
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,200
to cash rates, and so arbitrage between what airlines charge in miles and cash is no longer

184
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
possible.

185
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,120
So, they've now closed loopholes on both ends of the equation—you can't exploit

186
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,600
the accumulation of miles or the redemption of miles.

187
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,520
Essentially, the only factor placing a check on airlines' power is the exchange rate.

188
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,040
Considering how much of their profit comes from selling points to credit card companies

189
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,800
and other marketing partners, airlines do care tremendously about how much those companies

190
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,000
are willing to pay for points, and how much those companies are willing to pay is loosely

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,760
based on what the general public believes those points are worth.

192
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,180
Various travel and finance websites publish their estimated point valuations to help inform

193
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,040
consumers of whether they're getting a good deal with a given redemption, and there is

194
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
a good amount of variability.

195
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,600
Aggregating five estimates, the average value of one point is 1.218 cents for Delta Sky

196
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,060
Niles, 1.226 for United Mileage Plus, and 1.416 for American Advantage.

197
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,520
What this means is that, if all else were to be equal, consumers would be more incentivized

198
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,600
to fly American flights, use American co-branded credit cards, transfer points to American,

199
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,200
and more, which means credit card companies and other marketing partners are likely to

200
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,920
run out of American points sooner and need to buy more.

201
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,320
That being said, power is still in the hands of airlines, as there are only three major

202
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,520
long-haul airlines in the US, but far more credit card companies.

203
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,800
United is partnered with Chase, American with Citibank, and Delta with American Express,

204
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,480
but if any of these credit card companies refused to agree to a higher mile purchase

205
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,520
price when contract negotiations came around, the airline could dump them and switch to

206
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,440
Bank of America, Barkley, Capital One, Discover, each of which would be delighted to score

207
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,680
a major airline partner.

208
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,500
So why is it that the value of these frequent flyer programs has eclipsed the value of the

209
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
airlines themselves?

210
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,520
Well, it's because what's happening here is that airlines are essentially acting as

211
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,940
these central banks for their own virtual currencies.

212
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,060
They're acting like the US Treasury, or the Bank of England, or the European Central

213
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,100
Bank in that they control the supply of their currency, but airlines' power actually goes

214
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,500
far beyond that of these central banks.

215
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,820
Not only do they control the flow of the currency, but they also control the availability of

216
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,580
goods to spend it on.

217
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,540
Then, on top of that, it's as if these all-powerful central banks are operating as private, for-profit

218
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,840
companies that can just create more of their currency for the purposes of selling it at

219
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,740
any given time.

220
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,840
Airlines have nearly complete, unchecked control over a currency with which they are the only

221
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,640
entity that can convert it to cash—that is the key to their power.

222
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:31,160
Frequent flyer programs are genius financial instruments, because it's nearly impossible

223
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,520
for airlines to lose.

224
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Alright, so think about all the times in your day when you're not using your ears—maybe

225
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,040
while you get ready for the day, make dinner, do laundry, or drive to work.

226
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,680
All that time, you could be entertaining and educating yourself by listening to Audible.

227
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,960
Audible is the place to get spoken word entertainment—they have a massive streaming catalog of podcasts,

228
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,520
audiobooks, guided fitness, sleep tracks, and so much more.

229
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Then, on top of that, for anything not already included, you get one credit per month that

230
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,420
you can use to get any audiobook in their premium library, which includes pretty much

231
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,940
every major title.

232
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,680
For example, I recently listened to The Ride of a Lifetime, which is a memoir retelling

233
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,080
Bob Iger's rise from low-level production assistant at ABC to legendary Disney CEO,

234
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,420
especially focusing on the two-decade process of developing Shanghai Disneyland.

235
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,480
I absolutely love listening to audiobooks on Audible, and if you don't already, I

236
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,880
think you will.

237
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,720
Right now, for a limited time, you can save 60% on your first three months of Audible.

238
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,920
That's only $5.95 a month, so give yourself the gift of Audible by clicking the button

239
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:41,440
