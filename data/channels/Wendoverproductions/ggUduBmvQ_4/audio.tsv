0	7220	Last year, for the first time ever, the public got a glimpse into the financials of airline-frequent
7220	8940	flyer programs.
8940	12800	What they saw was truly astonishing.
12800	19300	During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines were hemorrhaging money and so, naturally,
19300	21180	they looked for a loan.
21180	26500	United, for example, sought $5 billion to tide the company over until travel came back,
26500	29860	but like with any loan, they needed to put up collateral.
29860	33620	They needed to offer something to the bank that it would acquire if the company failed
33620	35400	to pay the loan back.
35400	40020	The problem was, United wasn't worth much at the time since, of course, it was hemorrhaging
40020	44700	money, meaning it would have had to offer a huge chunk of itself as collateral.
44700	49820	Rather, they decided to offer one of their subsidiaries as collateral—Mileage Plus
49820	54280	Holdings LLC—essentially, their loyalty program.
54280	58420	Of course, given that United is a publicly traded company, they have various financial
58420	63040	reporting requirements, including the obligation to file a Form 8-K with the Securities and
63040	68520	Exchange Commission whenever a major business event takes place, such as taking out a multi-billion
68520	69660	dollar loan.
69660	75720	Of thousands, one line on this document stood out, quote, "'Multiplying Mileage Plus
75720	81700	Holdings' 2019 EBITDA by a factor of 12 equates to a Mileage Plus valuation of approximately
81700	83740	$21.9 billion.'
83740	85740	$21.9 billion.
85740	91700	That's the value of United's loyalty program, according to the company, and this loan."
91700	95900	Similar financial disclosures from Delta and American Airlines pegged the value of their
95900	102780	loyalty programs at $26 billion and $19.5 to $31.5 billion, respectively.
102780	107980	So, notwithstanding their size, why did these numbers turn heads?
107980	112720	Well, because of these—the airlines' market caps.
112720	117400	These figures equal the total value of all the shares in each company—it's essentially
117400	121820	a real-time indicator of what Wall Street considers a company worth, given the ebbs
121820	123980	and flows in stock prices.
123980	130520	At the time, United's was $10 billion, Delta's $20 billion, and American's $6 billion.
130520	135700	So, the value of each airline is less than the value of their loyalty programs, which
135700	141160	is interesting in and of itself, but the airlines own their loyalty programs.
141160	147120	Therefore, at least according to Wall Street, airlines themselves are worthless.
147120	151920	In fact, they're more than worthless—they have negative value, they're loss leaders,
151920	157980	and the only thing imparting each airline with value is its loyalty program.
157980	162200	This is a less absurd proposition than it might initially seem.
162200	169000	In 2018, well before the COVID-induced travel downturn, American Airlines earned about $0.1442
169000	176440	in passenger revenue per seat per mile flown, but simultaneously, it cost them $0.1485 to
176440	183040	operate a given seat one mile—so the airline actually lost about half a cent for each mile
183040	185020	it flew each seat.
185020	190920	The company, however, earned $1.9 billion in pre-tax profits, thanks exclusively to
190920	195040	their $4.2 billion in frequent flyer program revenue.
195040	199360	In the US, airports are plastered with ads for co-branded airline credit cards touting
199360	203600	free checked bags and other benefits, there's stuff with lounges accessible to frequent
203600	207960	flyers but not even first-class passengers, they're littered with priority lanes reserved
207960	212220	for getting elite status members through security and onto planes more quickly, airlines even
212220	217140	have their flight attendants acting as salespeople, reciting credit card pitches at 30,000 feet
217140	220640	in exchange for the chance of a commission on a passenger's sign-up.
220640	225240	The reason why the entire flying process in the US, and increasingly other countries,
225240	228700	seems like a carefully manicured experience nudging you to sign up for credit cards and
228700	232980	frequent flyer programs is because of these numbers.
232980	235920	Airlines are hardly transportation companies anymore.
235920	241800	Over the past 40 years, they have crafted a system so effective, so unbelievably advantageous
241800	246280	to their own interests, that they are now willing to lose money flying to prop up their
246280	253240	frequent flyer businesses—businesses whose core proposition is giving away free flights.
253240	257720	Today, airlines are basically banks.
257720	261940	This all snowballed from a concept no different than the loyalty punch card at your favorite
261940	266560	sandwich place—you fly a certain number of times, you get a free flight.
266560	270440	While airlines had already started tracking the activity of individual flyers, formal
270440	274800	frequent flyer programs became technically and legally possible with the deregulation
274800	277880	of the American airline industry in 1978.
277880	282260	The first program was set up by a small airline called Texas International, which later merged
282260	286760	with Continental, but the first major long-haul airline to do so was American Airlines in
286760	287760	1981.
287760	293100	What the airline observed was not surprising—American Advantage members were more likely to choose
293100	297480	to fly with American so that they could accumulate enough miles to get a free flight.
297480	302640	In fact, they were even willing to pay slightly more—some 5% extra for an American flight
302640	306840	rather than an equivalent United flight, for example—since that United flight wouldn't
306840	309200	get them any closer to a free American flight.
309200	313760	It's all sunk cost fallacy—if someone's earned 10,000 Advantage miles, they'd prefer
313760	318460	to fly American and get to the 12,500th for a free flight rather than starting from zero
318460	321720	with United, even if they'd earn the same number of miles.
321720	325760	Overall, the program certainly did have an expense for the airline, but it quickly became
325760	330320	clear that the expense was far eclipsed by the additional revenue it brought in.
330320	333980	But more significant than the program's launch was its first evolution beyond the
333980	335800	sandwich shop punch card.
335800	340700	In 1982, American partnered with Hertz and Holland America to allow its members to earn
340700	345200	points when renting cars or booking cruises, but the concept of earning points with partners
345200	347960	was not what was revolutionary about this.
347960	352480	Rather, it was the behind-the-scenes mechanics that made that possible.
352480	355920	American wasn't going to give miles away for free when people spent money at another
355920	360240	company because the redemption of miles did have a cost for the airline—beyond small
360240	363360	variable costs like food, fuel, insurance, and more.
363360	366880	There is potentially significant opportunity cost from offering a seat in exchange for
366880	370840	points if that seat might have otherwise been booked by a paying passenger.
370840	374680	Therefore, American needed to be compensated for the miles it gave to Hertz and Holland
374680	381880	America, and so, for the first time, it put a real monetary price on its imaginary points.
381880	386960	While the actual numbers are closely guarded secrets, American Airlines would, for example,
386960	390720	sell one point to Hertz for one cent, which Hertz would then reward to its customers in
390720	394680	order to incentivize them to rent at Hertz, rather than another rental car company that
394680	396400	did not reward airline points.
396400	401580	Now, if Hertz paid that one cent per mile, which is within the range of educated estimates,
401580	406460	and if a customer redeemed 25,000 miles for a domestic flight, which was a typical redemption
406460	412600	rate at the time, that means American would have earned $250 for a domestic flight.
412640	417360	Considering the typical variable cost for a domestic flight was about $15, American
417360	422160	Airlines quickly recognized just how incredible the profit opportunities could be.
422160	427080	They started to realize them in 1987, when American teamed up with Citibank to offer
427080	429620	a co-branded credit card.
429620	434720	That way, for every dollar spent on the card, the member would earn a point.
434720	438680	This dramatically increased the volume at which American and other airlines sold points
438680	443280	to external partners, and shifted these programs from ways to incentivize more spending on
443280	447600	airfare to profit centers in and of themselves.
447600	453240	Today, part of the strength of these multi-billion dollar programs is based on the fact that,
453240	457840	despite their strength, government and businesses essentially treat them the same as that sandwich
457840	459340	shop punch card.
459340	464200	To start with, almost universally, points are not taxed.
464200	467640	Despite the fact that one can accumulate points like income and redeem them for something
467640	472760	worth money, governments consider it a rebate, or cash back on your purchase, because to
472760	477640	get that reward, you had to spend money, and you can't exchange that reward for money,
477640	479040	at least officially.
479040	482760	Just as you don't pay tax on the amount saved when bananas are 25% off at the grocery
482760	486960	store, you don't pay tax when the airline awards you points you can use for free flights—in
486960	490400	this case, the savings just happen further away from purchase.
490400	495640	However, unlike with sandwich punch cards or banana discounts, in this case, the people
495640	500680	paying for the flights are often different than those receiving the reward.
500680	505240	Almost all of airlines' most frequent flyers travel on business, in which case their employers
505240	507080	pay the airfare.
507080	512440	Despite that, frequent flyer programs award points to the individual flying, not the individual
512440	513440	paying.
513440	517680	In addition, if the employee books the trip on their company card, they also get the credit
517680	519420	card points from that spent.
519420	522580	The company's paying don't really have a problem with this, because it essentially
522580	526660	acts as a free, tax-free benefit for their employees.
526660	530340	Business travel isn't anywhere as glamorous as it used to be, so companies are happy to
530340	533620	allow their employees to earn points they can eventually use for leisure travel, in
533620	536460	exchange for them getting out on the road and making money.
536460	540260	Of course, this potentially creates a scenario in which the individual is incentivized to
540260	545500	fly or pay more on the company's dime, but most don't seem too worried about this.
545500	552080	So, both tax law and company policy, or the lack of it, works in favor of the airline.
552080	556520	The way in which frequent flyer programs were set up wasn't perfect, though—there was
556520	558480	potential for exploits.
558480	564160	Namely, as airline revenue management systems became more complex, price and travel distance
564160	566360	became less and less correlated.
566360	571840	Nowadays, it's rather intuitive to us that the 400-mile flight from DC to Nantucket,
571840	575840	a high-end vacation destination, is going to cost more than the 400-mile flight from
575840	576840	DC to Boston.
577200	582160	In fact, American's lowest price for that Nantucket flight is $98, while its flights
582160	584520	to Boston start at just $49.
584520	589560	So, it's double the price for the same distance, simply because the more wealthy travelers
589560	594160	headed to Nantucket are more likely to pay for the convenience of a non-stop flight.
594160	598840	Meanwhile, based on the traditional one-mile, one-point system, the member would still gain
598840	603320	just 400 points for each of those flights despite the difference in price.
603320	607840	Therefore, if someone found an itinerary that was low cost but long distance, their
607840	612480	mileage earning could be so high that the miles earned would be worth more than the
612480	614200	cost of the flight.
614200	618800	For example, if one found an itinerary from Los Angeles to San Francisco via Chicago,
618800	623080	the traveler would earn ten times the points than if they flew direct, and more complex
623080	627480	revenue management systems would likely price that long, circuitous connecting itinerary
627480	631320	lower than the non-stop one since it was less convenient.
631320	636040	All around, this was bad for airlines—it was incentivizing people to take longer, multi-stop
636040	640360	itineraries, which cost the airline more to operate, and it forced them to give out more
640360	643280	miles, which cost the airline more in redemptions.
643280	647640	In short, they were incentivizing against their own interests.
647640	651960	This was a rare element of the system that did not work in their favor.
651960	653680	So, they changed it.
653680	658680	Over the past decade, nearly every major program has pivoted to a system where passengers are
658680	663320	rewarded points based on how many dollars they spend, rather than how many miles they
663320	664320	fly.
664320	668840	Among the big three American airlines, it's simple—you spend one dollar, you earn five
668840	669840	points.
669840	673180	This shifted the system from one where the airline wins overall, but might lose out from
673180	677520	time to time, to one where the airline quite literally cannot lose.
677520	682320	At least on the earnings side, revenue-based systems cannot be exploited.
682320	687160	But airlines quickly figured out how to restructure the redemption side in their favor, too.
687160	692560	It used to be that any economy-class flight within the continental US cost 12,500 points
692560	697760	ununited, regardless of whether it was a Tuesday in February or the Sunday after Thanksgiving.
697760	702240	That's despite the fact that cash rates were undoubtedly far higher on the Sunday
702240	706120	after Thanksgiving—one of the highest demand travel days of the year.
706120	709880	While availability of point seats differed, that meant that someone who did manage to
709880	713180	score Thanksgiving Sunday booking on points got a deal.
713180	717260	The cost for the airline to offer that seat on points was greater than what the airline
717260	718260	earned.
718260	723340	That's since the opportunity cost on those highest demand days is huge, as almost every
723340	726480	available seat is likely to be sold for cash.
726480	730020	Even if it all worked out in the end in the airline's favor, they didn't like these
730020	733340	losses, so they switched the way redemptions worked, too.
733340	738340	Now, nearly every major airline has dynamic award charts.
738340	743700	Just like how cash fares rise for high demand days, so too do point redemption rates.
743700	750180	For example, in October 2022, United is charging $114 for non-stop Newark to Denver flights
750180	755580	on low-demand Tuesdays, and $254 on high-demand Sundays.
755580	762260	Meanwhile, mile redemption rates rise from 8,300 to 22,200 points.
762260	766480	That roughly two-and-a-half times rise for each means that mile rates are now correlated
766480	772200	to cash rates, and so arbitrage between what airlines charge in miles and cash is no longer
772200	773200	possible.
773200	778120	So, they've now closed loopholes on both ends of the equation—you can't exploit
778120	781600	the accumulation of miles or the redemption of miles.
781600	787520	Essentially, the only factor placing a check on airlines' power is the exchange rate.
787520	791040	Considering how much of their profit comes from selling points to credit card companies
791040	795800	and other marketing partners, airlines do care tremendously about how much those companies
795800	800000	are willing to pay for points, and how much those companies are willing to pay is loosely
800000	803760	based on what the general public believes those points are worth.
803760	808180	Various travel and finance websites publish their estimated point valuations to help inform
808180	812040	consumers of whether they're getting a good deal with a given redemption, and there is
812040	814040	a good amount of variability.
814040	819600	Aggregating five estimates, the average value of one point is 1.218 cents for Delta Sky
819600	826060	Niles, 1.226 for United Mileage Plus, and 1.416 for American Advantage.
826060	830520	What this means is that, if all else were to be equal, consumers would be more incentivized
830520	835600	to fly American flights, use American co-branded credit cards, transfer points to American,
835600	839200	and more, which means credit card companies and other marketing partners are likely to
839200	842920	run out of American points sooner and need to buy more.
842920	847320	That being said, power is still in the hands of airlines, as there are only three major
847320	851520	long-haul airlines in the US, but far more credit card companies.
851520	855800	United is partnered with Chase, American with Citibank, and Delta with American Express,
855800	859480	but if any of these credit card companies refused to agree to a higher mile purchase
859480	863520	price when contract negotiations came around, the airline could dump them and switch to
863520	868440	Bank of America, Barkley, Capital One, Discover, each of which would be delighted to score
868440	870680	a major airline partner.
870680	875500	So why is it that the value of these frequent flyer programs has eclipsed the value of the
875500	876500	airlines themselves?
876500	880520	Well, it's because what's happening here is that airlines are essentially acting as
880520	883940	these central banks for their own virtual currencies.
883940	888060	They're acting like the US Treasury, or the Bank of England, or the European Central
888060	893100	Bank in that they control the supply of their currency, but airlines' power actually goes
893100	896500	far beyond that of these central banks.
896500	900820	Not only do they control the flow of the currency, but they also control the availability of
900820	902580	goods to spend it on.
902660	908540	Then, on top of that, it's as if these all-powerful central banks are operating as private, for-profit
908540	912840	companies that can just create more of their currency for the purposes of selling it at
912840	914740	any given time.
914740	919840	Airlines have nearly complete, unchecked control over a currency with which they are the only
919840	925640	entity that can convert it to cash—that is the key to their power.
925640	931160	Frequent flyer programs are genius financial instruments, because it's nearly impossible
931160	933520	for airlines to lose.
933520	938520	Alright, so think about all the times in your day when you're not using your ears—maybe
938520	943040	while you get ready for the day, make dinner, do laundry, or drive to work.
943040	947680	All that time, you could be entertaining and educating yourself by listening to Audible.
947680	953960	Audible is the place to get spoken word entertainment—they have a massive streaming catalog of podcasts,
953960	957520	audiobooks, guided fitness, sleep tracks, and so much more.
957560	962440	Then, on top of that, for anything not already included, you get one credit per month that
962440	966420	you can use to get any audiobook in their premium library, which includes pretty much
966420	967940	every major title.
967940	971680	For example, I recently listened to The Ride of a Lifetime, which is a memoir retelling
971680	977080	Bob Iger's rise from low-level production assistant at ABC to legendary Disney CEO,
977080	981420	especially focusing on the two-decade process of developing Shanghai Disneyland.
981420	985480	I absolutely love listening to audiobooks on Audible, and if you don't already, I
985480	986880	think you will.
986880	991720	Right now, for a limited time, you can save 60% on your first three months of Audible.
991720	995920	That's only $5.95 a month, so give yourself the gift of Audible by clicking the button
