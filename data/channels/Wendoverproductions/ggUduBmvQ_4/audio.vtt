00:00.000 --> 00:07.220
Last year, for the first time ever, the public got a glimpse into the financials of airline-frequent

00:07.220 --> 00:08.940
flyer programs.

00:08.940 --> 00:12.800
What they saw was truly astonishing.

00:12.800 --> 00:19.300
During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, airlines were hemorrhaging money and so, naturally,

00:19.300 --> 00:21.180
they looked for a loan.

00:21.180 --> 00:26.500
United, for example, sought $5 billion to tide the company over until travel came back,

00:26.500 --> 00:29.860
but like with any loan, they needed to put up collateral.

00:29.860 --> 00:33.620
They needed to offer something to the bank that it would acquire if the company failed

00:33.620 --> 00:35.400
to pay the loan back.

00:35.400 --> 00:40.020
The problem was, United wasn't worth much at the time since, of course, it was hemorrhaging

00:40.020 --> 00:44.700
money, meaning it would have had to offer a huge chunk of itself as collateral.

00:44.700 --> 00:49.820
Rather, they decided to offer one of their subsidiaries as collateral—Mileage Plus

00:49.820 --> 00:54.280
Holdings LLC—essentially, their loyalty program.

00:54.280 --> 00:58.420
Of course, given that United is a publicly traded company, they have various financial

00:58.420 --> 01:03.040
reporting requirements, including the obligation to file a Form 8-K with the Securities and

01:03.040 --> 01:08.520
Exchange Commission whenever a major business event takes place, such as taking out a multi-billion

01:08.520 --> 01:09.660
dollar loan.

01:09.660 --> 01:15.720
Of thousands, one line on this document stood out, quote, "'Multiplying Mileage Plus

01:15.720 --> 01:21.700
Holdings' 2019 EBITDA by a factor of 12 equates to a Mileage Plus valuation of approximately

01:21.700 --> 01:23.740
$21.9 billion.'

01:23.740 --> 01:25.740
$21.9 billion.

01:25.740 --> 01:31.700
That's the value of United's loyalty program, according to the company, and this loan."

01:31.700 --> 01:35.900
Similar financial disclosures from Delta and American Airlines pegged the value of their

01:35.900 --> 01:42.780
loyalty programs at $26 billion and $19.5 to $31.5 billion, respectively.

01:42.780 --> 01:47.980
So, notwithstanding their size, why did these numbers turn heads?

01:47.980 --> 01:52.720
Well, because of these—the airlines' market caps.

01:52.720 --> 01:57.400
These figures equal the total value of all the shares in each company—it's essentially

01:57.400 --> 02:01.820
a real-time indicator of what Wall Street considers a company worth, given the ebbs

02:01.820 --> 02:03.980
and flows in stock prices.

02:03.980 --> 02:10.520
At the time, United's was $10 billion, Delta's $20 billion, and American's $6 billion.

02:10.520 --> 02:15.700
So, the value of each airline is less than the value of their loyalty programs, which

02:15.700 --> 02:21.160
is interesting in and of itself, but the airlines own their loyalty programs.

02:21.160 --> 02:27.120
Therefore, at least according to Wall Street, airlines themselves are worthless.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.920
In fact, they're more than worthless—they have negative value, they're loss leaders,

02:31.920 --> 02:37.980
and the only thing imparting each airline with value is its loyalty program.

02:37.980 --> 02:42.200
This is a less absurd proposition than it might initially seem.

02:42.200 --> 02:49.000
In 2018, well before the COVID-induced travel downturn, American Airlines earned about $0.1442

02:49.000 --> 02:56.440
in passenger revenue per seat per mile flown, but simultaneously, it cost them $0.1485 to

02:56.440 --> 03:03.040
operate a given seat one mile—so the airline actually lost about half a cent for each mile

03:03.040 --> 03:05.020
it flew each seat.

03:05.020 --> 03:10.920
The company, however, earned $1.9 billion in pre-tax profits, thanks exclusively to

03:10.920 --> 03:15.040
their $4.2 billion in frequent flyer program revenue.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.360
In the US, airports are plastered with ads for co-branded airline credit cards touting

03:19.360 --> 03:23.600
free checked bags and other benefits, there's stuff with lounges accessible to frequent

03:23.600 --> 03:27.960
flyers but not even first-class passengers, they're littered with priority lanes reserved

03:27.960 --> 03:32.220
for getting elite status members through security and onto planes more quickly, airlines even

03:32.220 --> 03:37.140
have their flight attendants acting as salespeople, reciting credit card pitches at 30,000 feet

03:37.140 --> 03:40.640
in exchange for the chance of a commission on a passenger's sign-up.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.240
The reason why the entire flying process in the US, and increasingly other countries,

03:45.240 --> 03:48.700
seems like a carefully manicured experience nudging you to sign up for credit cards and

03:48.700 --> 03:52.980
frequent flyer programs is because of these numbers.

03:52.980 --> 03:55.920
Airlines are hardly transportation companies anymore.

03:55.920 --> 04:01.800
Over the past 40 years, they have crafted a system so effective, so unbelievably advantageous

04:01.800 --> 04:06.280
to their own interests, that they are now willing to lose money flying to prop up their

04:06.280 --> 04:13.240
frequent flyer businesses—businesses whose core proposition is giving away free flights.

04:13.240 --> 04:17.720
Today, airlines are basically banks.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.940
This all snowballed from a concept no different than the loyalty punch card at your favorite

04:21.940 --> 04:26.560
sandwich place—you fly a certain number of times, you get a free flight.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.440
While airlines had already started tracking the activity of individual flyers, formal

04:30.440 --> 04:34.800
frequent flyer programs became technically and legally possible with the deregulation

04:34.800 --> 04:37.880
of the American airline industry in 1978.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.260
The first program was set up by a small airline called Texas International, which later merged

04:42.260 --> 04:46.760
with Continental, but the first major long-haul airline to do so was American Airlines in

04:46.760 --> 04:47.760
1981.

04:47.760 --> 04:53.100
What the airline observed was not surprising—American Advantage members were more likely to choose

04:53.100 --> 04:57.480
to fly with American so that they could accumulate enough miles to get a free flight.

04:57.480 --> 05:02.640
In fact, they were even willing to pay slightly more—some 5% extra for an American flight

05:02.640 --> 05:06.840
rather than an equivalent United flight, for example—since that United flight wouldn't

05:06.840 --> 05:09.200
get them any closer to a free American flight.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.760
It's all sunk cost fallacy—if someone's earned 10,000 Advantage miles, they'd prefer

05:13.760 --> 05:18.460
to fly American and get to the 12,500th for a free flight rather than starting from zero

05:18.460 --> 05:21.720
with United, even if they'd earn the same number of miles.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.760
Overall, the program certainly did have an expense for the airline, but it quickly became

05:25.760 --> 05:30.320
clear that the expense was far eclipsed by the additional revenue it brought in.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.980
But more significant than the program's launch was its first evolution beyond the

05:33.980 --> 05:35.800
sandwich shop punch card.

05:35.800 --> 05:40.700
In 1982, American partnered with Hertz and Holland America to allow its members to earn

05:40.700 --> 05:45.200
points when renting cars or booking cruises, but the concept of earning points with partners

05:45.200 --> 05:47.960
was not what was revolutionary about this.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.480
Rather, it was the behind-the-scenes mechanics that made that possible.

05:52.480 --> 05:55.920
American wasn't going to give miles away for free when people spent money at another

05:55.920 --> 06:00.240
company because the redemption of miles did have a cost for the airline—beyond small

06:00.240 --> 06:03.360
variable costs like food, fuel, insurance, and more.

06:03.360 --> 06:06.880
There is potentially significant opportunity cost from offering a seat in exchange for

06:06.880 --> 06:10.840
points if that seat might have otherwise been booked by a paying passenger.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.680
Therefore, American needed to be compensated for the miles it gave to Hertz and Holland

06:14.680 --> 06:21.880
America, and so, for the first time, it put a real monetary price on its imaginary points.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.960
While the actual numbers are closely guarded secrets, American Airlines would, for example,

06:26.960 --> 06:30.720
sell one point to Hertz for one cent, which Hertz would then reward to its customers in

06:30.720 --> 06:34.680
order to incentivize them to rent at Hertz, rather than another rental car company that

06:34.680 --> 06:36.400
did not reward airline points.

06:36.400 --> 06:41.580
Now, if Hertz paid that one cent per mile, which is within the range of educated estimates,

06:41.580 --> 06:46.460
and if a customer redeemed 25,000 miles for a domestic flight, which was a typical redemption

06:46.460 --> 06:52.600
rate at the time, that means American would have earned $250 for a domestic flight.

06:52.640 --> 06:57.360
Considering the typical variable cost for a domestic flight was about $15, American

06:57.360 --> 07:02.160
Airlines quickly recognized just how incredible the profit opportunities could be.

07:02.160 --> 07:07.080
They started to realize them in 1987, when American teamed up with Citibank to offer

07:07.080 --> 07:09.620
a co-branded credit card.

07:09.620 --> 07:14.720
That way, for every dollar spent on the card, the member would earn a point.

07:14.720 --> 07:18.680
This dramatically increased the volume at which American and other airlines sold points

07:18.680 --> 07:23.280
to external partners, and shifted these programs from ways to incentivize more spending on

07:23.280 --> 07:27.600
airfare to profit centers in and of themselves.

07:27.600 --> 07:33.240
Today, part of the strength of these multi-billion dollar programs is based on the fact that,

07:33.240 --> 07:37.840
despite their strength, government and businesses essentially treat them the same as that sandwich

07:37.840 --> 07:39.340
shop punch card.

07:39.340 --> 07:44.200
To start with, almost universally, points are not taxed.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.640
Despite the fact that one can accumulate points like income and redeem them for something

07:47.640 --> 07:52.760
worth money, governments consider it a rebate, or cash back on your purchase, because to

07:52.760 --> 07:57.640
get that reward, you had to spend money, and you can't exchange that reward for money,

07:57.640 --> 07:59.040
at least officially.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.760
Just as you don't pay tax on the amount saved when bananas are 25% off at the grocery

08:02.760 --> 08:06.960
store, you don't pay tax when the airline awards you points you can use for free flights—in

08:06.960 --> 08:10.400
this case, the savings just happen further away from purchase.

08:10.400 --> 08:15.640
However, unlike with sandwich punch cards or banana discounts, in this case, the people

08:15.640 --> 08:20.680
paying for the flights are often different than those receiving the reward.

08:20.680 --> 08:25.240
Almost all of airlines' most frequent flyers travel on business, in which case their employers

08:25.240 --> 08:27.080
pay the airfare.

08:27.080 --> 08:32.440
Despite that, frequent flyer programs award points to the individual flying, not the individual

08:32.440 --> 08:33.440
paying.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.680
In addition, if the employee books the trip on their company card, they also get the credit

08:37.680 --> 08:39.420
card points from that spent.

08:39.420 --> 08:42.580
The company's paying don't really have a problem with this, because it essentially

08:42.580 --> 08:46.660
acts as a free, tax-free benefit for their employees.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.340
Business travel isn't anywhere as glamorous as it used to be, so companies are happy to

08:50.340 --> 08:53.620
allow their employees to earn points they can eventually use for leisure travel, in

08:53.620 --> 08:56.460
exchange for them getting out on the road and making money.

08:56.460 --> 09:00.260
Of course, this potentially creates a scenario in which the individual is incentivized to

09:00.260 --> 09:05.500
fly or pay more on the company's dime, but most don't seem too worried about this.

09:05.500 --> 09:12.080
So, both tax law and company policy, or the lack of it, works in favor of the airline.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.520
The way in which frequent flyer programs were set up wasn't perfect, though—there was

09:16.520 --> 09:18.480
potential for exploits.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.160
Namely, as airline revenue management systems became more complex, price and travel distance

09:24.160 --> 09:26.360
became less and less correlated.

09:26.360 --> 09:31.840
Nowadays, it's rather intuitive to us that the 400-mile flight from DC to Nantucket,

09:31.840 --> 09:35.840
a high-end vacation destination, is going to cost more than the 400-mile flight from

09:35.840 --> 09:36.840
DC to Boston.

09:37.200 --> 09:42.160
In fact, American's lowest price for that Nantucket flight is $98, while its flights

09:42.160 --> 09:44.520
to Boston start at just $49.

09:44.520 --> 09:49.560
So, it's double the price for the same distance, simply because the more wealthy travelers

09:49.560 --> 09:54.160
headed to Nantucket are more likely to pay for the convenience of a non-stop flight.

09:54.160 --> 09:58.840
Meanwhile, based on the traditional one-mile, one-point system, the member would still gain

09:58.840 --> 10:03.320
just 400 points for each of those flights despite the difference in price.

10:03.320 --> 10:07.840
Therefore, if someone found an itinerary that was low cost but long distance, their

10:07.840 --> 10:12.480
mileage earning could be so high that the miles earned would be worth more than the

10:12.480 --> 10:14.200
cost of the flight.

10:14.200 --> 10:18.800
For example, if one found an itinerary from Los Angeles to San Francisco via Chicago,

10:18.800 --> 10:23.080
the traveler would earn ten times the points than if they flew direct, and more complex

10:23.080 --> 10:27.480
revenue management systems would likely price that long, circuitous connecting itinerary

10:27.480 --> 10:31.320
lower than the non-stop one since it was less convenient.

10:31.320 --> 10:36.040
All around, this was bad for airlines—it was incentivizing people to take longer, multi-stop

10:36.040 --> 10:40.360
itineraries, which cost the airline more to operate, and it forced them to give out more

10:40.360 --> 10:43.280
miles, which cost the airline more in redemptions.

10:43.280 --> 10:47.640
In short, they were incentivizing against their own interests.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.960
This was a rare element of the system that did not work in their favor.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.680
So, they changed it.

10:53.680 --> 10:58.680
Over the past decade, nearly every major program has pivoted to a system where passengers are

10:58.680 --> 11:03.320
rewarded points based on how many dollars they spend, rather than how many miles they

11:03.320 --> 11:04.320
fly.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.840
Among the big three American airlines, it's simple—you spend one dollar, you earn five

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
points.

11:09.840 --> 11:13.180
This shifted the system from one where the airline wins overall, but might lose out from

11:13.180 --> 11:17.520
time to time, to one where the airline quite literally cannot lose.

11:17.520 --> 11:22.320
At least on the earnings side, revenue-based systems cannot be exploited.

11:22.320 --> 11:27.160
But airlines quickly figured out how to restructure the redemption side in their favor, too.

11:27.160 --> 11:32.560
It used to be that any economy-class flight within the continental US cost 12,500 points

11:32.560 --> 11:37.760
ununited, regardless of whether it was a Tuesday in February or the Sunday after Thanksgiving.

11:37.760 --> 11:42.240
That's despite the fact that cash rates were undoubtedly far higher on the Sunday

11:42.240 --> 11:46.120
after Thanksgiving—one of the highest demand travel days of the year.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.880
While availability of point seats differed, that meant that someone who did manage to

11:49.880 --> 11:53.180
score Thanksgiving Sunday booking on points got a deal.

11:53.180 --> 11:57.260
The cost for the airline to offer that seat on points was greater than what the airline

11:57.260 --> 11:58.260
earned.

11:58.260 --> 12:03.340
That's since the opportunity cost on those highest demand days is huge, as almost every

12:03.340 --> 12:06.480
available seat is likely to be sold for cash.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.020
Even if it all worked out in the end in the airline's favor, they didn't like these

12:10.020 --> 12:13.340
losses, so they switched the way redemptions worked, too.

12:13.340 --> 12:18.340
Now, nearly every major airline has dynamic award charts.

12:18.340 --> 12:23.700
Just like how cash fares rise for high demand days, so too do point redemption rates.

12:23.700 --> 12:30.180
For example, in October 2022, United is charging $114 for non-stop Newark to Denver flights

12:30.180 --> 12:35.580
on low-demand Tuesdays, and $254 on high-demand Sundays.

12:35.580 --> 12:42.260
Meanwhile, mile redemption rates rise from 8,300 to 22,200 points.

12:42.260 --> 12:46.480
That roughly two-and-a-half times rise for each means that mile rates are now correlated

12:46.480 --> 12:52.200
to cash rates, and so arbitrage between what airlines charge in miles and cash is no longer

12:52.200 --> 12:53.200
possible.

12:53.200 --> 12:58.120
So, they've now closed loopholes on both ends of the equation—you can't exploit

12:58.120 --> 13:01.600
the accumulation of miles or the redemption of miles.

13:01.600 --> 13:07.520
Essentially, the only factor placing a check on airlines' power is the exchange rate.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.040
Considering how much of their profit comes from selling points to credit card companies

13:11.040 --> 13:15.800
and other marketing partners, airlines do care tremendously about how much those companies

13:15.800 --> 13:20.000
are willing to pay for points, and how much those companies are willing to pay is loosely

13:20.000 --> 13:23.760
based on what the general public believes those points are worth.

13:23.760 --> 13:28.180
Various travel and finance websites publish their estimated point valuations to help inform

13:28.180 --> 13:32.040
consumers of whether they're getting a good deal with a given redemption, and there is

13:32.040 --> 13:34.040
a good amount of variability.

13:34.040 --> 13:39.600
Aggregating five estimates, the average value of one point is 1.218 cents for Delta Sky

13:39.600 --> 13:46.060
Niles, 1.226 for United Mileage Plus, and 1.416 for American Advantage.

13:46.060 --> 13:50.520
What this means is that, if all else were to be equal, consumers would be more incentivized

13:50.520 --> 13:55.600
to fly American flights, use American co-branded credit cards, transfer points to American,

13:55.600 --> 13:59.200
and more, which means credit card companies and other marketing partners are likely to

13:59.200 --> 14:02.920
run out of American points sooner and need to buy more.

14:02.920 --> 14:07.320
That being said, power is still in the hands of airlines, as there are only three major

14:07.320 --> 14:11.520
long-haul airlines in the US, but far more credit card companies.

14:11.520 --> 14:15.800
United is partnered with Chase, American with Citibank, and Delta with American Express,

14:15.800 --> 14:19.480
but if any of these credit card companies refused to agree to a higher mile purchase

14:19.480 --> 14:23.520
price when contract negotiations came around, the airline could dump them and switch to

14:23.520 --> 14:28.440
Bank of America, Barkley, Capital One, Discover, each of which would be delighted to score

14:28.440 --> 14:30.680
a major airline partner.

14:30.680 --> 14:35.500
So why is it that the value of these frequent flyer programs has eclipsed the value of the

14:35.500 --> 14:36.500
airlines themselves?

14:36.500 --> 14:40.520
Well, it's because what's happening here is that airlines are essentially acting as

14:40.520 --> 14:43.940
these central banks for their own virtual currencies.

14:43.940 --> 14:48.060
They're acting like the US Treasury, or the Bank of England, or the European Central

14:48.060 --> 14:53.100
Bank in that they control the supply of their currency, but airlines' power actually goes

14:53.100 --> 14:56.500
far beyond that of these central banks.

14:56.500 --> 15:00.820
Not only do they control the flow of the currency, but they also control the availability of

15:00.820 --> 15:02.580
goods to spend it on.

15:02.660 --> 15:08.540
Then, on top of that, it's as if these all-powerful central banks are operating as private, for-profit

15:08.540 --> 15:12.840
companies that can just create more of their currency for the purposes of selling it at

15:12.840 --> 15:14.740
any given time.

15:14.740 --> 15:19.840
Airlines have nearly complete, unchecked control over a currency with which they are the only

15:19.840 --> 15:25.640
entity that can convert it to cash—that is the key to their power.

15:25.640 --> 15:31.160
Frequent flyer programs are genius financial instruments, because it's nearly impossible

15:31.160 --> 15:33.520
for airlines to lose.

15:33.520 --> 15:38.520
Alright, so think about all the times in your day when you're not using your ears—maybe

15:38.520 --> 15:43.040
while you get ready for the day, make dinner, do laundry, or drive to work.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.680
All that time, you could be entertaining and educating yourself by listening to Audible.

15:47.680 --> 15:53.960
Audible is the place to get spoken word entertainment—they have a massive streaming catalog of podcasts,

15:53.960 --> 15:57.520
audiobooks, guided fitness, sleep tracks, and so much more.

15:57.560 --> 16:02.440
Then, on top of that, for anything not already included, you get one credit per month that

16:02.440 --> 16:06.420
you can use to get any audiobook in their premium library, which includes pretty much

16:06.420 --> 16:07.940
every major title.

16:07.940 --> 16:11.680
For example, I recently listened to The Ride of a Lifetime, which is a memoir retelling

16:11.680 --> 16:17.080
Bob Iger's rise from low-level production assistant at ABC to legendary Disney CEO,

16:17.080 --> 16:21.420
especially focusing on the two-decade process of developing Shanghai Disneyland.

16:21.420 --> 16:25.480
I absolutely love listening to audiobooks on Audible, and if you don't already, I

16:25.480 --> 16:26.880
think you will.

16:26.880 --> 16:31.720
Right now, for a limited time, you can save 60% on your first three months of Audible.

16:31.720 --> 16:35.920
That's only $5.95 a month, so give yourself the gift of Audible by clicking the button

16:35.920 --> 16:41.440
