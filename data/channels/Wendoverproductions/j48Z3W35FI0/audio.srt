00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,580
When nuclear bombs obliterate the earth or a virus wipes out the human race or robots

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:20,520
push mankind out of existence, the US government believes that democracy should continue on.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,260
The country believes that, even if the population of the US ceases to exist, the country should

6
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,260
go on.

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,100
In to its almost paranoid nature, the US government has a series of defined protocols on how to

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,440
continue the country when the country is no longer.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,820
The continuity of government plans.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,280
You probably already know about part of these plans because you probably know about the

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,840
US president's line of succession.

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,400
If the president dies, there's a list of 17 people ranging all the way from the vice

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,480
president down to the secretary of homeland security who would take their place.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,200
With such a long list, the chances of the US going without a president are near none.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,520
The one time a year when the entire line gathers together—the state of the union—one individual

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:11,960
in the line of succession is appointed designated survivor to wait out in a bunker to run the

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
government if the rest of it dies.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,120
But the line of succession is the basic stuff—the stuff people already know.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,200
What's far less known is the semi-secret protocols and places the government has spent

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,240
billions of dollars and decades building.

21
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,280
However, until just 60 or 70 years ago, the US felt it was untouchable.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,320
At no time in history had an enemy existed as relatively close to the US as during the

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,520
cold war.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,540
The US's foreign policy always kept in mind that an ocean separated it from its enemies

25
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:48,080
but with the invention of nuclear bombs an enemy could go from declaring war on the US

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,580
to toppling its government in a matter of hours.

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,860
During these days, the US government began actively preparing for doomsday.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,700
There are four main bunkers from which the US government would run the country following

29
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:08,820
a world-ending event—the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, Raven Rock Mountain Complex,

30
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,440
Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center, and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

31
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,560
The president is the most important person to survive doomsday both for symbolic and

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,140
logistical reasons.

33
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,660
If a nuclear warhead is inbound to Washington, he or she would most likely evacuate downstairs

34
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,020
from the White House into their underground bunker, but that's not guaranteed.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,620
During the Truman administration, the president refused to leave the Oval Office during what

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,840
was believed to be an attack.

37
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,020
This ended up being a false alarm, but some presidents have said that they believe they

38
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,980
should write out an attack with the rest of the population.

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,600
It's just like saying a captain should go down with their ship.

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,680
The Oval Office, and even the White House bunker, is not the safest place someone can

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,480
be during an attack, but morale saves lives and seeing a president braving out the fight

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,320
can help create a sense of national unity that would keep the country together.

43
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:07,040
A single person is replaceable, but the government as a whole is more delicate.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,760
Raven Rock, Pennsylvania would serve as the underground pentagon.

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,120
All the leaders of the armed forces would evacuate by helicopter to this facility in

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,340
the event of an attack and command their troops across the country and the world.

47
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,760
During an attack of an apocalyptic scale, it's likely that martial law would be imposed

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,840
meaning that the military would take over day to day control of the country.

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,880
The commanders would have wide ranging, almost dictatorial powers and habeas corpus would

50
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,000
be revoked.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,240
From distributing food to serving as law enforcement to keeping the lights on, the armed forces

52
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,760
would truly work on the front lines of rebuilding a destroyed country.

53
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,640
The Cheyenne Mountain Complex just out of Colorado Springs, Colorado would serve as

54
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,680
the home to NORAD—the agency responsible for controlling and tracking the skies above

55
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,440
the US and Canada.

56
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,780
So, if the above ground world proved too dangerous for the country's leadership, these four

57
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,720
underground bunkers would serve as the home to the bare bones of the US government, but

58
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,640
what about the rest of it?

59
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,440
Nearly 4.5 million people are employed by the US federal government and they all work

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
to keep it running.

61
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,240
Where would the hundreds of government agencies go?

62
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Well, nobody knows exactly, at least publicly, but we do know how they would relocate.

63
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,220
You might have heard of the DEFCON system.

64
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,840
It makes frequent appearances in movies, but few have heard of CogCon.

65
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,840
CogCon is a readiness level system that directs agencies how to prepare for the activation

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,720
of the government's continuity of government plans.

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,980
At CogCon 4, the lowest level, every US government agency must be able to relocate to an alternate

68
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,760
facility and perform basic functions within 12 hours.

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,420
It's an incredibly ambitious plan.

70
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:56,880
At CogCon 3, this number goes down to 8 hours then at CogCon 2 is when things get real.

71
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,340
At this level, doomsday is imminent.

72
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,760
Every agency has three sites for their continuity plan—A, B, and C—and their agency would

73
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,080
split into three corresponding teams—A, B, and C. The A team would relocate to a secure

74
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,000
facility near its normal headquarters—probably bunkers under DC.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,400
The B team would relocate near the Mount Weather facility and the C team would relocate to

76
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,800
another undisclosed facility.

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,500
Each team would be ready to take over operations at a moment's notice.

78
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,720
The A team would continue operations for as long as possible—either until they're

79
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,160
dead or communications are cut off—then the B team would seamlessly take over operations.

80
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
If the B team falls, the C team would serve as the final chance for the survival of the

81
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,940
government agency.

82
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,920
When the surface of the earth is unsurvivable, there is one other place to go other than

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,300
underground—to the sky.

84
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,200
The traditional Air Force One has redundancy upon redundancy and most likely dozens of

85
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,200
classified defense measures, but there's a different plane from which the president

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:05,000
might command the country after doomsday—the Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,280
It became increasingly clear to leadership under the Carter administration that the bunkers

88
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,760
would do little to protect against a direct nuclear strike.

89
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,160
In fact, they would just concentrate the very individuals that the enemy would attack into

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,540
a few holes in mountains.

91
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,680
Surviving a nuclear blast while seven miles above earth, however, is far more conceivable.

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,800
This plane is sometimes referred to as Air Force One when it matters.

93
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,260
Whenever the president travels, one of these planes is stationed at most a couple hundred

94
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,480
miles away.

95
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,760
From this plane, the president can command the country indefinitely.

96
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,600
It can be refueled mid-air by tanker so, barring technical issues, it can remain flying for

97
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,940
as long as the food and water lasts.

98
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,800
In a doomsday scenario, this plane could literally stay airborne for weeks at a time to keep

99
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,120
the country's leadership safe.

100
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,200
After Armageddon, the United States' goal would be to rebuild the ailing country with

101
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:05,160
however many survivors remained, but how would the country continue as the same country when

102
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,320
most everyone was dead?

103
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,100
Because of the line of succession, the president could be an unknown, unelected official with

104
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,480
a bare bones government of just a few thousand people so what's to say to a survivor in

105
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,960
Texas or Oregon or Alaska that it's still the same country continuing on?

106
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,360
Well, what binds America together is a common culture and legacy.

107
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,940
Art and historical artifacts are the physical representations of this and their survival

108
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,520
would pose a powerful message about the state of the union.

109
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,800
On doomsday, resources would be scarce and disjointed so officials have had to make decisions

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,460
about which items to save and which would be left behind.

111
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,640
For example, priority would be given to Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra da Vinci over Roger van

112
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,960
der Weyden's St. George and the Dragon and the Declaration of Independence would be saved

113
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,600
before the Constitution.

114
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,120
Ideally, though, all three of the nation's most important documents—the Declaration

115
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,080
of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights—would be evacuated from Washington.

116
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,580
Grouped together, they would be called Freedom Documents Group 1 and while some high-level

117
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,300
officials would evacuate Washington by road, these three documents would get their own

118
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,900
helicopter straight to Mount Weather to continue the powerful legacy of the United States.

119
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,380
Nobody knows exactly how or if the US government will survive doomsday.

120
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,460
All we know are some of the plans.

121
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,220
Plans are just plans though and do not account for the unknown.

122
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,980
In the event that the United States is truly threatened by nuclear war, pandemic, or any

123
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:39,460
other world-ending event, who knows if the population will even believe that they are

124
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,340
still in the United States.

125
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,380
People distinguishes one country from another other than what people think and if people

126
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,580
believe they are part of the country of Alaska or the kingdom of California, then for the

127
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,860
most part, they are.

128
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,100
If the principles of separation of power, judicial review, checks and balances, limited

129
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,180
government, federalism, and popular sovereignty live on past the end, the continuity of government

130
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,940
plans have succeeded, even if the members of government die.

131
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,980
These plans are not about saving the president or the secretary of defense or any one person.

132
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,580
They're about making sure the structure of democratic government continues on through

133
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,740
thick and thin.
