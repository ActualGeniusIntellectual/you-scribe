00:08.860 --> 00:13.580
When nuclear bombs obliterate the earth or a virus wipes out the human race or robots

00:13.580 --> 00:20.520
push mankind out of existence, the US government believes that democracy should continue on.

00:20.520 --> 00:26.260
The country believes that, even if the population of the US ceases to exist, the country should

00:26.260 --> 00:27.260
go on.

00:27.340 --> 00:33.100
In to its almost paranoid nature, the US government has a series of defined protocols on how to

00:33.100 --> 00:36.440
continue the country when the country is no longer.

00:36.440 --> 00:38.820
The continuity of government plans.

00:38.820 --> 00:43.280
You probably already know about part of these plans because you probably know about the

00:43.280 --> 00:45.840
US president's line of succession.

00:45.840 --> 00:50.400
If the president dies, there's a list of 17 people ranging all the way from the vice

00:50.400 --> 00:55.480
president down to the secretary of homeland security who would take their place.

00:55.480 --> 01:01.200
With such a long list, the chances of the US going without a president are near none.

01:01.200 --> 01:06.520
The one time a year when the entire line gathers together—the state of the union—one individual

01:06.520 --> 01:11.960
in the line of succession is appointed designated survivor to wait out in a bunker to run the

01:11.960 --> 01:14.320
government if the rest of it dies.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.120
But the line of succession is the basic stuff—the stuff people already know.

01:18.120 --> 01:23.200
What's far less known is the semi-secret protocols and places the government has spent

01:23.200 --> 01:26.240
billions of dollars and decades building.

01:26.240 --> 01:32.280
However, until just 60 or 70 years ago, the US felt it was untouchable.

01:32.280 --> 01:37.320
At no time in history had an enemy existed as relatively close to the US as during the

01:37.320 --> 01:38.520
cold war.

01:38.520 --> 01:43.540
The US's foreign policy always kept in mind that an ocean separated it from its enemies

01:43.540 --> 01:48.080
but with the invention of nuclear bombs an enemy could go from declaring war on the US

01:48.080 --> 01:51.580
to toppling its government in a matter of hours.

01:51.580 --> 01:56.860
During these days, the US government began actively preparing for doomsday.

01:56.860 --> 02:01.700
There are four main bunkers from which the US government would run the country following

02:01.700 --> 02:08.820
a world-ending event—the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, Raven Rock Mountain Complex,

02:08.820 --> 02:13.440
Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center, and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

02:13.440 --> 02:18.560
The president is the most important person to survive doomsday both for symbolic and

02:18.560 --> 02:20.140
logistical reasons.

02:20.140 --> 02:25.660
If a nuclear warhead is inbound to Washington, he or she would most likely evacuate downstairs

02:25.660 --> 02:30.020
from the White House into their underground bunker, but that's not guaranteed.

02:30.020 --> 02:34.620
During the Truman administration, the president refused to leave the Oval Office during what

02:34.620 --> 02:36.840
was believed to be an attack.

02:36.840 --> 02:41.020
This ended up being a false alarm, but some presidents have said that they believe they

02:41.020 --> 02:43.980
should write out an attack with the rest of the population.

02:43.980 --> 02:47.600
It's just like saying a captain should go down with their ship.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.680
The Oval Office, and even the White House bunker, is not the safest place someone can

02:51.680 --> 02:57.480
be during an attack, but morale saves lives and seeing a president braving out the fight

02:57.480 --> 03:02.320
can help create a sense of national unity that would keep the country together.

03:02.320 --> 03:07.040
A single person is replaceable, but the government as a whole is more delicate.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.760
Raven Rock, Pennsylvania would serve as the underground pentagon.

03:10.760 --> 03:15.120
All the leaders of the armed forces would evacuate by helicopter to this facility in

03:15.120 --> 03:20.340
the event of an attack and command their troops across the country and the world.

03:20.340 --> 03:24.760
During an attack of an apocalyptic scale, it's likely that martial law would be imposed

03:24.760 --> 03:28.840
meaning that the military would take over day to day control of the country.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.880
The commanders would have wide ranging, almost dictatorial powers and habeas corpus would

03:33.880 --> 03:35.000
be revoked.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.240
From distributing food to serving as law enforcement to keeping the lights on, the armed forces

03:40.240 --> 03:44.760
would truly work on the front lines of rebuilding a destroyed country.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.640
The Cheyenne Mountain Complex just out of Colorado Springs, Colorado would serve as

03:48.640 --> 03:53.680
the home to NORAD—the agency responsible for controlling and tracking the skies above

03:53.680 --> 03:55.440
the US and Canada.

03:55.440 --> 04:00.780
So, if the above ground world proved too dangerous for the country's leadership, these four

04:00.780 --> 04:05.720
underground bunkers would serve as the home to the bare bones of the US government, but

04:05.720 --> 04:07.640
what about the rest of it?

04:07.640 --> 04:13.440
Nearly 4.5 million people are employed by the US federal government and they all work

04:13.440 --> 04:14.920
to keep it running.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.240
Where would the hundreds of government agencies go?

04:18.240 --> 04:23.840
Well, nobody knows exactly, at least publicly, but we do know how they would relocate.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.220
You might have heard of the DEFCON system.

04:26.220 --> 04:30.840
It makes frequent appearances in movies, but few have heard of CogCon.

04:30.840 --> 04:35.840
CogCon is a readiness level system that directs agencies how to prepare for the activation

04:35.840 --> 04:38.720
of the government's continuity of government plans.

04:38.720 --> 04:44.980
At CogCon 4, the lowest level, every US government agency must be able to relocate to an alternate

04:44.980 --> 04:48.760
facility and perform basic functions within 12 hours.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.420
It's an incredibly ambitious plan.

04:51.420 --> 04:56.880
At CogCon 3, this number goes down to 8 hours then at CogCon 2 is when things get real.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.340
At this level, doomsday is imminent.

04:59.340 --> 05:04.760
Every agency has three sites for their continuity plan—A, B, and C—and their agency would

05:04.760 --> 05:11.080
split into three corresponding teams—A, B, and C. The A team would relocate to a secure

05:11.080 --> 05:16.000
facility near its normal headquarters—probably bunkers under DC.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.400
The B team would relocate near the Mount Weather facility and the C team would relocate to

05:20.400 --> 05:22.800
another undisclosed facility.

05:22.800 --> 05:26.500
Each team would be ready to take over operations at a moment's notice.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.720
The A team would continue operations for as long as possible—either until they're

05:30.720 --> 05:36.160
dead or communications are cut off—then the B team would seamlessly take over operations.

05:36.160 --> 05:41.160
If the B team falls, the C team would serve as the final chance for the survival of the

05:41.160 --> 05:42.940
government agency.

05:42.940 --> 05:47.920
When the surface of the earth is unsurvivable, there is one other place to go other than

05:47.920 --> 05:50.300
underground—to the sky.

05:50.300 --> 05:55.200
The traditional Air Force One has redundancy upon redundancy and most likely dozens of

05:55.200 --> 05:59.200
classified defense measures, but there's a different plane from which the president

05:59.200 --> 06:05.000
might command the country after doomsday—the Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.280
It became increasingly clear to leadership under the Carter administration that the bunkers

06:09.280 --> 06:12.760
would do little to protect against a direct nuclear strike.

06:12.760 --> 06:17.160
In fact, they would just concentrate the very individuals that the enemy would attack into

06:17.160 --> 06:19.540
a few holes in mountains.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.680
Surviving a nuclear blast while seven miles above earth, however, is far more conceivable.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.800
This plane is sometimes referred to as Air Force One when it matters.

06:28.800 --> 06:33.260
Whenever the president travels, one of these planes is stationed at most a couple hundred

06:33.260 --> 06:34.480
miles away.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.760
From this plane, the president can command the country indefinitely.

06:37.760 --> 06:44.600
It can be refueled mid-air by tanker so, barring technical issues, it can remain flying for

06:44.600 --> 06:47.940
as long as the food and water lasts.

06:47.940 --> 06:53.800
In a doomsday scenario, this plane could literally stay airborne for weeks at a time to keep

06:53.800 --> 06:56.120
the country's leadership safe.

06:56.120 --> 07:00.200
After Armageddon, the United States' goal would be to rebuild the ailing country with

07:00.200 --> 07:05.160
however many survivors remained, but how would the country continue as the same country when

07:05.160 --> 07:07.320
most everyone was dead?

07:07.320 --> 07:12.100
Because of the line of succession, the president could be an unknown, unelected official with

07:12.100 --> 07:17.480
a bare bones government of just a few thousand people so what's to say to a survivor in

07:17.480 --> 07:22.960
Texas or Oregon or Alaska that it's still the same country continuing on?

07:22.960 --> 07:27.360
Well, what binds America together is a common culture and legacy.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.940
Art and historical artifacts are the physical representations of this and their survival

07:31.940 --> 07:35.520
would pose a powerful message about the state of the union.

07:35.520 --> 07:40.800
On doomsday, resources would be scarce and disjointed so officials have had to make decisions

07:40.800 --> 07:44.460
about which items to save and which would be left behind.

07:44.460 --> 07:49.640
For example, priority would be given to Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra da Vinci over Roger van

07:49.640 --> 07:53.960
der Weyden's St. George and the Dragon and the Declaration of Independence would be saved

07:53.960 --> 07:55.600
before the Constitution.

07:55.600 --> 08:00.120
Ideally, though, all three of the nation's most important documents—the Declaration

08:00.120 --> 08:05.080
of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights—would be evacuated from Washington.

08:05.080 --> 08:09.580
Grouped together, they would be called Freedom Documents Group 1 and while some high-level

08:09.580 --> 08:14.300
officials would evacuate Washington by road, these three documents would get their own

08:14.300 --> 08:19.900
helicopter straight to Mount Weather to continue the powerful legacy of the United States.

08:19.900 --> 08:24.380
Nobody knows exactly how or if the US government will survive doomsday.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.460
All we know are some of the plans.

08:26.460 --> 08:30.220
Plans are just plans though and do not account for the unknown.

08:30.220 --> 08:34.980
In the event that the United States is truly threatened by nuclear war, pandemic, or any

08:34.980 --> 08:39.460
other world-ending event, who knows if the population will even believe that they are

08:39.460 --> 08:41.340
still in the United States.

08:41.340 --> 08:45.380
People distinguishes one country from another other than what people think and if people

08:45.380 --> 08:49.580
believe they are part of the country of Alaska or the kingdom of California, then for the

08:49.580 --> 08:50.860
most part, they are.

08:50.860 --> 08:56.100
If the principles of separation of power, judicial review, checks and balances, limited

08:56.100 --> 09:01.180
government, federalism, and popular sovereignty live on past the end, the continuity of government

09:01.180 --> 09:04.940
plans have succeeded, even if the members of government die.

09:04.940 --> 09:09.980
These plans are not about saving the president or the secretary of defense or any one person.

09:09.980 --> 09:14.580
They're about making sure the structure of democratic government continues on through

09:14.580 --> 09:17.740
thick and thin.

09:17.740 --> 09:20.060
