8860	13580	When nuclear bombs obliterate the earth or a virus wipes out the human race or robots
13580	20520	push mankind out of existence, the US government believes that democracy should continue on.
20520	26260	The country believes that, even if the population of the US ceases to exist, the country should
26260	27260	go on.
27340	33100	In to its almost paranoid nature, the US government has a series of defined protocols on how to
33100	36440	continue the country when the country is no longer.
36440	38820	The continuity of government plans.
38820	43280	You probably already know about part of these plans because you probably know about the
43280	45840	US president's line of succession.
45840	50400	If the president dies, there's a list of 17 people ranging all the way from the vice
50400	55480	president down to the secretary of homeland security who would take their place.
55480	61200	With such a long list, the chances of the US going without a president are near none.
61200	66520	The one time a year when the entire line gathers together—the state of the union—one individual
66520	71960	in the line of succession is appointed designated survivor to wait out in a bunker to run the
71960	74320	government if the rest of it dies.
74320	78120	But the line of succession is the basic stuff—the stuff people already know.
78120	83200	What's far less known is the semi-secret protocols and places the government has spent
83200	86240	billions of dollars and decades building.
86240	92280	However, until just 60 or 70 years ago, the US felt it was untouchable.
92280	97320	At no time in history had an enemy existed as relatively close to the US as during the
97320	98520	cold war.
98520	103540	The US's foreign policy always kept in mind that an ocean separated it from its enemies
103540	108080	but with the invention of nuclear bombs an enemy could go from declaring war on the US
108080	111580	to toppling its government in a matter of hours.
111580	116860	During these days, the US government began actively preparing for doomsday.
116860	121700	There are four main bunkers from which the US government would run the country following
121700	128820	a world-ending event—the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, Raven Rock Mountain Complex,
128820	133440	Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center, and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex.
133440	138560	The president is the most important person to survive doomsday both for symbolic and
138560	140140	logistical reasons.
140140	145660	If a nuclear warhead is inbound to Washington, he or she would most likely evacuate downstairs
145660	150020	from the White House into their underground bunker, but that's not guaranteed.
150020	154620	During the Truman administration, the president refused to leave the Oval Office during what
154620	156840	was believed to be an attack.
156840	161020	This ended up being a false alarm, but some presidents have said that they believe they
161020	163980	should write out an attack with the rest of the population.
163980	167600	It's just like saying a captain should go down with their ship.
167600	171680	The Oval Office, and even the White House bunker, is not the safest place someone can
171680	177480	be during an attack, but morale saves lives and seeing a president braving out the fight
177480	182320	can help create a sense of national unity that would keep the country together.
182320	187040	A single person is replaceable, but the government as a whole is more delicate.
187040	190760	Raven Rock, Pennsylvania would serve as the underground pentagon.
190760	195120	All the leaders of the armed forces would evacuate by helicopter to this facility in
195120	200340	the event of an attack and command their troops across the country and the world.
200340	204760	During an attack of an apocalyptic scale, it's likely that martial law would be imposed
204760	208840	meaning that the military would take over day to day control of the country.
208840	213880	The commanders would have wide ranging, almost dictatorial powers and habeas corpus would
213880	215000	be revoked.
215000	220240	From distributing food to serving as law enforcement to keeping the lights on, the armed forces
220240	224760	would truly work on the front lines of rebuilding a destroyed country.
224760	228640	The Cheyenne Mountain Complex just out of Colorado Springs, Colorado would serve as
228640	233680	the home to NORAD—the agency responsible for controlling and tracking the skies above
233680	235440	the US and Canada.
235440	240780	So, if the above ground world proved too dangerous for the country's leadership, these four
240780	245720	underground bunkers would serve as the home to the bare bones of the US government, but
245720	247640	what about the rest of it?
247640	253440	Nearly 4.5 million people are employed by the US federal government and they all work
253440	254920	to keep it running.
254920	258240	Where would the hundreds of government agencies go?
258240	263840	Well, nobody knows exactly, at least publicly, but we do know how they would relocate.
263840	266220	You might have heard of the DEFCON system.
266220	270840	It makes frequent appearances in movies, but few have heard of CogCon.
270840	275840	CogCon is a readiness level system that directs agencies how to prepare for the activation
275840	278720	of the government's continuity of government plans.
278720	284980	At CogCon 4, the lowest level, every US government agency must be able to relocate to an alternate
284980	288760	facility and perform basic functions within 12 hours.
288760	291420	It's an incredibly ambitious plan.
291420	296880	At CogCon 3, this number goes down to 8 hours then at CogCon 2 is when things get real.
296880	299340	At this level, doomsday is imminent.
299340	304760	Every agency has three sites for their continuity plan—A, B, and C—and their agency would
304760	311080	split into three corresponding teams—A, B, and C. The A team would relocate to a secure
311080	316000	facility near its normal headquarters—probably bunkers under DC.
316000	320400	The B team would relocate near the Mount Weather facility and the C team would relocate to
320400	322800	another undisclosed facility.
322800	326500	Each team would be ready to take over operations at a moment's notice.
326500	330720	The A team would continue operations for as long as possible—either until they're
330720	336160	dead or communications are cut off—then the B team would seamlessly take over operations.
336160	341160	If the B team falls, the C team would serve as the final chance for the survival of the
341160	342940	government agency.
342940	347920	When the surface of the earth is unsurvivable, there is one other place to go other than
347920	350300	underground—to the sky.
350300	355200	The traditional Air Force One has redundancy upon redundancy and most likely dozens of
355200	359200	classified defense measures, but there's a different plane from which the president
359200	365000	might command the country after doomsday—the Boeing E-4 Advanced Airborne Command Post.
365000	369280	It became increasingly clear to leadership under the Carter administration that the bunkers
369280	372760	would do little to protect against a direct nuclear strike.
372760	377160	In fact, they would just concentrate the very individuals that the enemy would attack into
377160	379540	a few holes in mountains.
379540	384680	Surviving a nuclear blast while seven miles above earth, however, is far more conceivable.
384680	388800	This plane is sometimes referred to as Air Force One when it matters.
388800	393260	Whenever the president travels, one of these planes is stationed at most a couple hundred
393260	394480	miles away.
394480	397760	From this plane, the president can command the country indefinitely.
397760	404600	It can be refueled mid-air by tanker so, barring technical issues, it can remain flying for
404600	407940	as long as the food and water lasts.
407940	413800	In a doomsday scenario, this plane could literally stay airborne for weeks at a time to keep
413800	416120	the country's leadership safe.
416120	420200	After Armageddon, the United States' goal would be to rebuild the ailing country with
420200	425160	however many survivors remained, but how would the country continue as the same country when
425160	427320	most everyone was dead?
427320	432100	Because of the line of succession, the president could be an unknown, unelected official with
432100	437480	a bare bones government of just a few thousand people so what's to say to a survivor in
437480	442960	Texas or Oregon or Alaska that it's still the same country continuing on?
442960	447360	Well, what binds America together is a common culture and legacy.
447360	451940	Art and historical artifacts are the physical representations of this and their survival
451940	455520	would pose a powerful message about the state of the union.
455520	460800	On doomsday, resources would be scarce and disjointed so officials have had to make decisions
460800	464460	about which items to save and which would be left behind.
464460	469640	For example, priority would be given to Leonardo da Vinci's Ginevra da Vinci over Roger van
469640	473960	der Weyden's St. George and the Dragon and the Declaration of Independence would be saved
473960	475600	before the Constitution.
475600	480120	Ideally, though, all three of the nation's most important documents—the Declaration
480120	485080	of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights—would be evacuated from Washington.
485080	489580	Grouped together, they would be called Freedom Documents Group 1 and while some high-level
489580	494300	officials would evacuate Washington by road, these three documents would get their own
494300	499900	helicopter straight to Mount Weather to continue the powerful legacy of the United States.
499900	504380	Nobody knows exactly how or if the US government will survive doomsday.
504380	506460	All we know are some of the plans.
506460	510220	Plans are just plans though and do not account for the unknown.
510220	514980	In the event that the United States is truly threatened by nuclear war, pandemic, or any
514980	519460	other world-ending event, who knows if the population will even believe that they are
519460	521340	still in the United States.
521340	525380	People distinguishes one country from another other than what people think and if people
525380	529580	believe they are part of the country of Alaska or the kingdom of California, then for the
529580	530860	most part, they are.
530860	536100	If the principles of separation of power, judicial review, checks and balances, limited
536100	541180	government, federalism, and popular sovereignty live on past the end, the continuity of government
541180	544940	plans have succeeded, even if the members of government die.
544940	549980	These plans are not about saving the president or the secretary of defense or any one person.
549980	554580	They're about making sure the structure of democratic government continues on through
554580	557740	thick and thin.
