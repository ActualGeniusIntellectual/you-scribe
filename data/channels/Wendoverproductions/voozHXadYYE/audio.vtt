00:09.480 --> 00:11.800
Imagine a patented apple.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.640
Just like only Nabisco can sell Oreos and only Unilever can sell Marmite, imagine there

00:16.640 --> 00:21.520
was only one company worldwide with the right to harvest apples.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.840
That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?

00:23.840 --> 00:27.100
Now imagine a patented gene sequence.

00:27.100 --> 00:32.760
Imagine a single company had exclusive rights to all usages of a particular section of the

00:32.760 --> 00:34.200
human genome.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.380
That would also be absurd, right?

00:37.380 --> 00:43.820
Back in 1990, renowned geneticist Mary-Claire King made an announcement that shook the world.

00:43.820 --> 00:48.860
She and her research team had discovered that somewhere in this section of the 17th chromosome

00:48.860 --> 00:51.780
was a gene linked to breast cancer.

00:51.780 --> 00:57.020
She didn't know exactly where it was, or what it was, or why it was linked to cancer,

00:57.020 --> 00:59.180
all she knew was that it was there.

00:59.180 --> 01:03.300
What followed was a race to find this so-called breast cancer gene.

01:03.300 --> 01:08.120
Colleges, companies, and governments all devoted enormous resources to finding the gene that

01:08.120 --> 01:13.400
could tell people, with relative accuracy, whether they would contract cancer years before

01:13.400 --> 01:14.680
any other test.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.660
With preventative mastectomies, survival rates for this type of cancer could skyrocket.

01:19.660 --> 01:22.580
Then, in 1994, it happened.

01:22.580 --> 01:26.620
A team of researchers from the University of Utah announced that they had found the

01:26.620 --> 01:28.580
gene—BRCA1.

01:28.580 --> 01:34.220
Soon after, they found another similar gene with nearly identical effects—BRCA2.

01:34.220 --> 01:39.340
Females found to have a mutation in one of these two genes had an 80% chance of contracting

01:39.340 --> 01:43.660
breast cancer in their lifetimes, but the good news was that you could test for it.

01:43.660 --> 01:49.060
This was a life-changing breakthrough for the thousands found to have the mutation yearly.

01:49.060 --> 01:52.940
Some of the researchers from the University of Utah saw the commercial application of

01:52.940 --> 01:58.940
this and founded a company—Myriad Genetics—which soon patented the two genes, quite literally.

01:58.940 --> 02:06.540
In their patent document is the full genetic sequence of the BRCA1 gene—21,328 characters

02:06.540 --> 02:11.620
of G's, C's, A's, and T's that represent what is in the human body.

02:11.620 --> 02:16.780
They patented something inside you—something not all that different than patenting that

02:16.780 --> 02:17.780
apple.

02:17.940 --> 02:22.400
Apple is, too, just a long sequence of G's, C's, A's, and T's.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.820
The only difference is that it's longer.

02:24.820 --> 02:30.700
Myriad Genetics, as the only company globally allowed to do anything with the BRCA genes,

02:30.700 --> 02:33.120
had an absolute monopoly on testing.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.820
If you wanted to see if you had the gene mutation that would give you a heads up on cancer,

02:37.820 --> 02:44.320
you had to go to Myriad, and so it came at a price—up to $4,000 even though the actual

02:44.360 --> 02:48.320
process of performing the test cost only a fraction of that.

02:48.320 --> 02:52.720
This was almost certainly unjust, and so the ACLU took notice.

02:52.720 --> 02:57.980
They, along with a group of plaintiffs, sued Myriad Genetics on the basis that their patents

02:57.980 --> 03:01.880
were on non-patentable material—the human genome.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.880
Much like you can't patent an apple because you didn't create the apple, the plaintiffs

03:05.880 --> 03:10.160
argued that Myriad couldn't patent the genes because they didn't create them—nature

03:10.160 --> 03:14.360
did—but Myriad was not alone in the process of patenting genes.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.520
In fact, at the time, 21% of the human genome had been patented.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.560
The district court ended up ruling in the plaintiffs' favor so Myriad appealed and

03:23.560 --> 03:28.000
the case went to a federal appeals court that ended up ruling in Myriad's favor so the

03:28.000 --> 03:31.580
ACLU petitioned for their case to be heard in the Supreme Court.

03:31.580 --> 03:36.720
They agreed and on April 15th, the case for the Association of Molecular Pathology vs.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.900
Myriad Genetics Inc. reached Washington.

03:39.900 --> 03:45.140
In a stunning turn of events, all nine Supreme Court justices sided in the plaintiffs'

03:45.140 --> 03:51.380
favor therefore virtually ending the process of human genome patents, but was it right?

03:51.380 --> 03:56.080
Up to this point, Myriad has probably seemed like the bad guy, but consider this.

03:56.080 --> 03:59.980
The individuals who founded Myriad were the ones that discovered the effect of the gene

03:59.980 --> 04:04.380
mutation in question so shouldn't they be rewarded for their years of work?

04:04.380 --> 04:07.160
That's really the question with all patents.

04:07.160 --> 04:12.320
On one hand, patents drive innovation because they allow companies to monetize discoveries

04:12.320 --> 04:17.520
that cost huge amounts to research and develop, but on the other hand, restrictive patents

04:17.520 --> 04:22.640
and monopolies stop these innovations from getting to the people who need them most.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.880
Without the ability to make money off of genetic testing, it can be argued that many companies

04:27.880 --> 04:31.620
won't have the motivation to research genetic predispositions.

04:31.620 --> 04:35.600
So that brings us to the critical question, what should be patentable?

04:35.600 --> 04:39.320
There are certainly cases where patents on genetic material have helped.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.880
In this age where editing genome sequences is cheap and easy, it's very possible for

04:43.880 --> 04:48.760
companies to modify organisms in a way that make them true, original creations that can

04:48.760 --> 04:50.680
be legitimately patented.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.000
For example, the apple we talked about at the beginning could not be patented, but a

04:55.000 --> 04:58.520
genetically modified apple, that's fair game.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.800
In fact, patents on genetically modified food have existed for decades.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.820
Golden rice is a much-lotted, yet controversial variety of genetically modified rice that

05:07.820 --> 05:13.180
includes a high amount of beta-carotene which helps treat vitamin A deficiency—an affliction

05:13.180 --> 05:17.720
that kills up to 2 million individuals yearly in developing countries.

05:17.720 --> 05:22.840
As a crop that is cheap, easy to cultivate, and already popular in developing countries,

05:22.840 --> 05:26.340
a fortified variety of rice can help millions yearly.

05:26.340 --> 05:30.760
The rice does not, however, have much of a commercial application since the places that

05:30.760 --> 05:35.760
need it are the places without the money to buy other treatments to vitamin A deficiency.

05:35.760 --> 05:40.440
Nonetheless, by holding the patent, the owners are able to manage the distribution of the

05:40.440 --> 05:46.680
seeds by giving them for free to any farmer who makes less than $10,000 a year while funding

05:46.680 --> 05:50.360
the program with limited commercial applications elsewhere.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.840
Although some companies have a more commercial focus.

05:53.840 --> 05:59.960
93% of corn in the US is genetically modified and much of that comes from Monsanto.

05:59.960 --> 06:04.520
Monsanto sells different varieties of genetically modified corn and other crops under different

06:04.520 --> 06:06.960
brands just like you would any other product.

06:06.960 --> 06:12.200
There's Smart Stack Rib Complete which is less susceptible to destructive insects, there's

06:12.200 --> 06:16.600
Roundup Ready corn that isn't affected by Roundup, an herbicide that kills weeds, and

06:16.600 --> 06:21.400
there's Drought Card corn which is tolerant to lower levels of water during dry years.

06:21.400 --> 06:25.800
When a farmer wants to use one of these variants of corn they just go to a dealer and buy the

06:25.800 --> 06:30.840
seeds like any other product except the difference between seeds and traditional products is

06:30.840 --> 06:34.520
that seeds grow into plants which make more seeds.

06:34.520 --> 06:39.320
If Monsanto allowed farmers to keep and share their seeds they would only be able to sell

06:39.320 --> 06:41.960
their product once, so they don't.

06:41.960 --> 06:46.360
Those who buy the product are required to sign an agreement to not save or share any

06:46.360 --> 06:51.100
seed and those who do get caught and are met by a hefty lawsuit.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.120
But this isn't really different than any other product.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.600
This is their form of rights management.

06:56.600 --> 07:00.800
When you watch a video on Netflix, in the terms of use, you've agreed to only use

07:00.800 --> 07:06.240
the product for yourself just like the farmers agree to only use the Monsanto seed for themselves,

07:06.240 --> 07:10.240
even though, with both products, it's rather easy to share.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.360
Just like with patented gene sequences, there's the question of where the line is between

07:14.360 --> 07:17.400
patents improving and harming the greater good.

07:17.400 --> 07:22.240
If companies are not able to recuperate research and development costs, they won't research

07:22.240 --> 07:23.240
or develop.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.600
In a free market, farmers can choose whether or not to buy the Monsanto seeds given the

07:27.600 --> 07:33.160
terms and, overwhelmingly, they do because the seeds make more money than they cost.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.240
It's just simple math.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.760
You should form your own opinion on patented genetically modified plants and seeds, but

07:39.760 --> 07:45.700
it's indisputable that there are upsides that can be argued, though, what about animals?

07:45.700 --> 07:50.400
In 1980, the US Supreme Court decided that genetically modified animals could be patented

07:50.400 --> 07:54.080
if they were altered in a meaningful way from their original selves.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.420
European patent law considers the same true.

07:56.420 --> 08:02.060
In fact, you might already be eating genetically modified animals without even knowing it.

08:02.060 --> 08:06.840
The company AquaBounty Technologies successfully created a variant of salmon that grows at

08:06.840 --> 08:12.880
a faster rate and so they patented it—the Aqua Advantage salmon—and in 2016 it hit

08:12.880 --> 08:14.880
the shelves in Canada.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.600
Researchers have found the salmon safe to eat, but it is, of course, different.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.700
If the genetically modified salmon were to be accidentally released into the wild, some

08:23.700 --> 08:29.020
are concerned that their genetic makeup could be spread by out-competing the normal salmon—although,

08:29.020 --> 08:33.160
in computer models it was concluded that the normal salmon would prevail since it has a

08:33.160 --> 08:35.040
higher fertility rate.

08:35.040 --> 08:39.680
In the US, the Aqua Advantage salmon has been approved by the FDA, but it cannot be sold

08:39.680 --> 08:43.720
until labeling standards for genetically modified food are developed.

08:43.720 --> 08:46.280
But just imagine the next step.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.320
Genetically modified humans are coming and whether or not companies will be allowed to

08:50.320 --> 08:55.720
patent their processes will have a huge effect on how commonplace human gene editing will

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
become.

08:56.720 --> 09:01.480
The Myriad Genetics case only decided that patents on naturally occurring gene sequences

09:01.480 --> 09:06.600
were not allowed, but the decision that allowed patents on genetically modified animals specifically

09:06.600 --> 09:11.980
excluded humans meaning that as of now you would not be granted a patent for human gene

09:11.980 --> 09:16.240
editing in the US, but there are plenty of other countries.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.020
Most have not even considered this question.

09:19.020 --> 09:24.400
If you imagine a world with patented commercial human gene editing, you are imagining a world

09:24.400 --> 09:29.680
where you can decide if your child will have blue eyes or not, if they're tall or not,

09:29.680 --> 09:35.200
if they're smart or not, if they are autistic or not, if they will have heart disease or

09:35.200 --> 09:41.520
not, if they will have Alzheimer's or not, if they will have cancer or not.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.640
The real question is not if it's ethical to allow patented human gene editing, it's

09:46.640 --> 09:49.560
if it's ethical to not.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.440
If you want to learn more about genetic research, there's a great course that I recommend

09:53.440 --> 09:57.300

10:09.220 --> 10:14.020
field combining computer science and genetic research building software to analyze genetic

10:14.020 --> 10:15.220
information.

10:15.220 --> 10:19.680
