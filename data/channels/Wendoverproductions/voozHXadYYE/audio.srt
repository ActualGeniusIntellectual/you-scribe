3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,800
Imagine a patented apple.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:16,640
Just like only Nabisco can sell Oreos and only Unilever can sell Marmite, imagine there

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,520
was only one company worldwide with the right to harvest apples.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,840
That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,100
Now imagine a patented gene sequence.

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:32,760
Imagine a single company had exclusive rights to all usages of a particular section of the

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,200
human genome.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,380
That would also be absurd, right?

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,820
Back in 1990, renowned geneticist Mary-Claire King made an announcement that shook the world.

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:48,860
She and her research team had discovered that somewhere in this section of the 17th chromosome

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,780
was a gene linked to breast cancer.

14
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,020
She didn't know exactly where it was, or what it was, or why it was linked to cancer,

15
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,180
all she knew was that it was there.

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:03,300
What followed was a race to find this so-called breast cancer gene.

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,120
Colleges, companies, and governments all devoted enormous resources to finding the gene that

18
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,400
could tell people, with relative accuracy, whether they would contract cancer years before

19
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,680
any other test.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,660
With preventative mastectomies, survival rates for this type of cancer could skyrocket.

21
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,580
Then, in 1994, it happened.

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,620
A team of researchers from the University of Utah announced that they had found the

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,580
gene—BRCA1.

24
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:34,220
Soon after, they found another similar gene with nearly identical effects—BRCA2.

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:39,340
Females found to have a mutation in one of these two genes had an 80% chance of contracting

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,660
breast cancer in their lifetimes, but the good news was that you could test for it.

27
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,060
This was a life-changing breakthrough for the thousands found to have the mutation yearly.

28
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,940
Some of the researchers from the University of Utah saw the commercial application of

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,940
this and founded a company—Myriad Genetics—which soon patented the two genes, quite literally.

30
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:06,540
In their patent document is the full genetic sequence of the BRCA1 gene—21,328 characters

31
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,620
of G's, C's, A's, and T's that represent what is in the human body.

32
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,780
They patented something inside you—something not all that different than patenting that

33
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,780
apple.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,400
Apple is, too, just a long sequence of G's, C's, A's, and T's.

35
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,820
The only difference is that it's longer.

36
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:30,700
Myriad Genetics, as the only company globally allowed to do anything with the BRCA genes,

37
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,120
had an absolute monopoly on testing.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,820
If you wanted to see if you had the gene mutation that would give you a heads up on cancer,

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,320
you had to go to Myriad, and so it came at a price—up to $4,000 even though the actual

40
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,320
process of performing the test cost only a fraction of that.

41
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,720
This was almost certainly unjust, and so the ACLU took notice.

42
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,980
They, along with a group of plaintiffs, sued Myriad Genetics on the basis that their patents

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,880
were on non-patentable material—the human genome.

44
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,880
Much like you can't patent an apple because you didn't create the apple, the plaintiffs

45
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,160
argued that Myriad couldn't patent the genes because they didn't create them—nature

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,360
did—but Myriad was not alone in the process of patenting genes.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,520
In fact, at the time, 21% of the human genome had been patented.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,560
The district court ended up ruling in the plaintiffs' favor so Myriad appealed and

49
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,000
the case went to a federal appeals court that ended up ruling in Myriad's favor so the

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,580
ACLU petitioned for their case to be heard in the Supreme Court.

51
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,720
They agreed and on April 15th, the case for the Association of Molecular Pathology vs.

52
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,900
Myriad Genetics Inc. reached Washington.

53
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,140
In a stunning turn of events, all nine Supreme Court justices sided in the plaintiffs'

54
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,380
favor therefore virtually ending the process of human genome patents, but was it right?

55
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,080
Up to this point, Myriad has probably seemed like the bad guy, but consider this.

56
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,980
The individuals who founded Myriad were the ones that discovered the effect of the gene

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,380
mutation in question so shouldn't they be rewarded for their years of work?

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,160
That's really the question with all patents.

59
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,320
On one hand, patents drive innovation because they allow companies to monetize discoveries

60
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:17,520
that cost huge amounts to research and develop, but on the other hand, restrictive patents

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,640
and monopolies stop these innovations from getting to the people who need them most.

62
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,880
Without the ability to make money off of genetic testing, it can be argued that many companies

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,620
won't have the motivation to research genetic predispositions.

64
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,600
So that brings us to the critical question, what should be patentable?

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,320
There are certainly cases where patents on genetic material have helped.

66
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,880
In this age where editing genome sequences is cheap and easy, it's very possible for

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,760
companies to modify organisms in a way that make them true, original creations that can

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,680
be legitimately patented.

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,000
For example, the apple we talked about at the beginning could not be patented, but a

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,520
genetically modified apple, that's fair game.

71
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,800
In fact, patents on genetically modified food have existed for decades.

72
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,820
Golden rice is a much-lotted, yet controversial variety of genetically modified rice that

73
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,180
includes a high amount of beta-carotene which helps treat vitamin A deficiency—an affliction

74
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,720
that kills up to 2 million individuals yearly in developing countries.

75
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,840
As a crop that is cheap, easy to cultivate, and already popular in developing countries,

76
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,340
a fortified variety of rice can help millions yearly.

77
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:30,760
The rice does not, however, have much of a commercial application since the places that

78
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,760
need it are the places without the money to buy other treatments to vitamin A deficiency.

79
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,440
Nonetheless, by holding the patent, the owners are able to manage the distribution of the

80
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,680
seeds by giving them for free to any farmer who makes less than $10,000 a year while funding

81
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,360
the program with limited commercial applications elsewhere.

82
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,840
Although some companies have a more commercial focus.

83
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,960
93% of corn in the US is genetically modified and much of that comes from Monsanto.

84
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,520
Monsanto sells different varieties of genetically modified corn and other crops under different

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,960
brands just like you would any other product.

86
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:12,200
There's Smart Stack Rib Complete which is less susceptible to destructive insects, there's

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,600
Roundup Ready corn that isn't affected by Roundup, an herbicide that kills weeds, and

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,400
there's Drought Card corn which is tolerant to lower levels of water during dry years.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,800
When a farmer wants to use one of these variants of corn they just go to a dealer and buy the

90
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,840
seeds like any other product except the difference between seeds and traditional products is

91
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,520
that seeds grow into plants which make more seeds.

92
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,320
If Monsanto allowed farmers to keep and share their seeds they would only be able to sell

93
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,960
their product once, so they don't.

94
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,360
Those who buy the product are required to sign an agreement to not save or share any

95
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,100
seed and those who do get caught and are met by a hefty lawsuit.

96
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,120
But this isn't really different than any other product.

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,600
This is their form of rights management.

98
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,800
When you watch a video on Netflix, in the terms of use, you've agreed to only use

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,240
the product for yourself just like the farmers agree to only use the Monsanto seed for themselves,

100
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,240
even though, with both products, it's rather easy to share.

101
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,360
Just like with patented gene sequences, there's the question of where the line is between

102
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,400
patents improving and harming the greater good.

103
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,240
If companies are not able to recuperate research and development costs, they won't research

104
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
or develop.

105
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,600
In a free market, farmers can choose whether or not to buy the Monsanto seeds given the

106
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,160
terms and, overwhelmingly, they do because the seeds make more money than they cost.

107
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,240
It's just simple math.

108
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,760
You should form your own opinion on patented genetically modified plants and seeds, but

109
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:45,700
it's indisputable that there are upsides that can be argued, though, what about animals?

110
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:50,400
In 1980, the US Supreme Court decided that genetically modified animals could be patented

111
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
if they were altered in a meaningful way from their original selves.

112
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,420
European patent law considers the same true.

113
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,060
In fact, you might already be eating genetically modified animals without even knowing it.

114
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,840
The company AquaBounty Technologies successfully created a variant of salmon that grows at

115
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,880
a faster rate and so they patented it—the Aqua Advantage salmon—and in 2016 it hit

116
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,880
the shelves in Canada.

117
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,600
Researchers have found the salmon safe to eat, but it is, of course, different.

118
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,700
If the genetically modified salmon were to be accidentally released into the wild, some

119
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:29,020
are concerned that their genetic makeup could be spread by out-competing the normal salmon—although,

120
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,160
in computer models it was concluded that the normal salmon would prevail since it has a

121
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,040
higher fertility rate.

122
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,680
In the US, the Aqua Advantage salmon has been approved by the FDA, but it cannot be sold

123
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,720
until labeling standards for genetically modified food are developed.

124
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,280
But just imagine the next step.

125
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,320
Genetically modified humans are coming and whether or not companies will be allowed to

126
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,720
patent their processes will have a huge effect on how commonplace human gene editing will

127
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
become.

128
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,480
The Myriad Genetics case only decided that patents on naturally occurring gene sequences

129
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,600
were not allowed, but the decision that allowed patents on genetically modified animals specifically

130
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,980
excluded humans meaning that as of now you would not be granted a patent for human gene

131
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:16,240
editing in the US, but there are plenty of other countries.

132
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,020
Most have not even considered this question.

133
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:24,400
If you imagine a world with patented commercial human gene editing, you are imagining a world

134
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,680
where you can decide if your child will have blue eyes or not, if they're tall or not,

135
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,200
if they're smart or not, if they are autistic or not, if they will have heart disease or

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,520
not, if they will have Alzheimer's or not, if they will have cancer or not.

137
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,640
The real question is not if it's ethical to allow patented human gene editing, it's

138
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,560
if it's ethical to not.

139
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,440
If you want to learn more about genetic research, there's a great course that I recommend

140
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,300
on Skillshare called An Introduction to Bioinformatics.

141
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,080
As you've heard before, Skillshare is a great source of over 18,000 classes about

142
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,040
anything and everything.

143
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,220
This specific course covers the rather interesting subject of bioinformatics which is the interdisciplinary

144
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,020
field combining computer science and genetic research building software to analyze genetic

145
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,220
information.

146
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,680
This one and a third hour course gives a great overview of the topic and you can access it

147
