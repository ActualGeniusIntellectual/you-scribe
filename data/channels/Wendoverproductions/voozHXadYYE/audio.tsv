9480	11800	Imagine a patented apple.
11800	16640	Just like only Nabisco can sell Oreos and only Unilever can sell Marmite, imagine there
16640	21520	was only one company worldwide with the right to harvest apples.
21520	23840	That would be ridiculous, wouldn't it?
23840	27100	Now imagine a patented gene sequence.
27100	32760	Imagine a single company had exclusive rights to all usages of a particular section of the
32760	34200	human genome.
34200	37380	That would also be absurd, right?
37380	43820	Back in 1990, renowned geneticist Mary-Claire King made an announcement that shook the world.
43820	48860	She and her research team had discovered that somewhere in this section of the 17th chromosome
48860	51780	was a gene linked to breast cancer.
51780	57020	She didn't know exactly where it was, or what it was, or why it was linked to cancer,
57020	59180	all she knew was that it was there.
59180	63300	What followed was a race to find this so-called breast cancer gene.
63300	68120	Colleges, companies, and governments all devoted enormous resources to finding the gene that
68120	73400	could tell people, with relative accuracy, whether they would contract cancer years before
73400	74680	any other test.
74680	79660	With preventative mastectomies, survival rates for this type of cancer could skyrocket.
79660	82580	Then, in 1994, it happened.
82580	86620	A team of researchers from the University of Utah announced that they had found the
86620	88580	gene—BRCA1.
88580	94220	Soon after, they found another similar gene with nearly identical effects—BRCA2.
94220	99340	Females found to have a mutation in one of these two genes had an 80% chance of contracting
99340	103660	breast cancer in their lifetimes, but the good news was that you could test for it.
103660	109060	This was a life-changing breakthrough for the thousands found to have the mutation yearly.
109060	112940	Some of the researchers from the University of Utah saw the commercial application of
112940	118940	this and founded a company—Myriad Genetics—which soon patented the two genes, quite literally.
118940	126540	In their patent document is the full genetic sequence of the BRCA1 gene—21,328 characters
126540	131620	of G's, C's, A's, and T's that represent what is in the human body.
131620	136780	They patented something inside you—something not all that different than patenting that
136780	137780	apple.
137940	142400	Apple is, too, just a long sequence of G's, C's, A's, and T's.
142400	144820	The only difference is that it's longer.
144820	150700	Myriad Genetics, as the only company globally allowed to do anything with the BRCA genes,
150700	153120	had an absolute monopoly on testing.
153120	157820	If you wanted to see if you had the gene mutation that would give you a heads up on cancer,
157820	164320	you had to go to Myriad, and so it came at a price—up to $4,000 even though the actual
164360	168320	process of performing the test cost only a fraction of that.
168320	172720	This was almost certainly unjust, and so the ACLU took notice.
172720	177980	They, along with a group of plaintiffs, sued Myriad Genetics on the basis that their patents
177980	181880	were on non-patentable material—the human genome.
181880	185880	Much like you can't patent an apple because you didn't create the apple, the plaintiffs
185880	190160	argued that Myriad couldn't patent the genes because they didn't create them—nature
190160	194360	did—but Myriad was not alone in the process of patenting genes.
194360	199520	In fact, at the time, 21% of the human genome had been patented.
199520	203560	The district court ended up ruling in the plaintiffs' favor so Myriad appealed and
203560	208000	the case went to a federal appeals court that ended up ruling in Myriad's favor so the
208000	211580	ACLU petitioned for their case to be heard in the Supreme Court.
211580	216720	They agreed and on April 15th, the case for the Association of Molecular Pathology vs.
216720	219900	Myriad Genetics Inc. reached Washington.
219900	225140	In a stunning turn of events, all nine Supreme Court justices sided in the plaintiffs'
225140	231380	favor therefore virtually ending the process of human genome patents, but was it right?
231380	236080	Up to this point, Myriad has probably seemed like the bad guy, but consider this.
236080	239980	The individuals who founded Myriad were the ones that discovered the effect of the gene
239980	244380	mutation in question so shouldn't they be rewarded for their years of work?
244380	247160	That's really the question with all patents.
247160	252320	On one hand, patents drive innovation because they allow companies to monetize discoveries
252320	257520	that cost huge amounts to research and develop, but on the other hand, restrictive patents
257520	262640	and monopolies stop these innovations from getting to the people who need them most.
262640	267880	Without the ability to make money off of genetic testing, it can be argued that many companies
267880	271620	won't have the motivation to research genetic predispositions.
271620	275600	So that brings us to the critical question, what should be patentable?
275600	279320	There are certainly cases where patents on genetic material have helped.
279320	283880	In this age where editing genome sequences is cheap and easy, it's very possible for
283880	288760	companies to modify organisms in a way that make them true, original creations that can
288760	290680	be legitimately patented.
290680	295000	For example, the apple we talked about at the beginning could not be patented, but a
295000	298520	genetically modified apple, that's fair game.
298520	302800	In fact, patents on genetically modified food have existed for decades.
302800	307820	Golden rice is a much-lotted, yet controversial variety of genetically modified rice that
307820	313180	includes a high amount of beta-carotene which helps treat vitamin A deficiency—an affliction
313180	317720	that kills up to 2 million individuals yearly in developing countries.
317720	322840	As a crop that is cheap, easy to cultivate, and already popular in developing countries,
322840	326340	a fortified variety of rice can help millions yearly.
326340	330760	The rice does not, however, have much of a commercial application since the places that
330760	335760	need it are the places without the money to buy other treatments to vitamin A deficiency.
335760	340440	Nonetheless, by holding the patent, the owners are able to manage the distribution of the
340440	346680	seeds by giving them for free to any farmer who makes less than $10,000 a year while funding
346680	350360	the program with limited commercial applications elsewhere.
350360	353840	Although some companies have a more commercial focus.
353840	359960	93% of corn in the US is genetically modified and much of that comes from Monsanto.
359960	364520	Monsanto sells different varieties of genetically modified corn and other crops under different
364520	366960	brands just like you would any other product.
366960	372200	There's Smart Stack Rib Complete which is less susceptible to destructive insects, there's
372200	376600	Roundup Ready corn that isn't affected by Roundup, an herbicide that kills weeds, and
376600	381400	there's Drought Card corn which is tolerant to lower levels of water during dry years.
381400	385800	When a farmer wants to use one of these variants of corn they just go to a dealer and buy the
385800	390840	seeds like any other product except the difference between seeds and traditional products is
390840	394520	that seeds grow into plants which make more seeds.
394520	399320	If Monsanto allowed farmers to keep and share their seeds they would only be able to sell
399320	401960	their product once, so they don't.
401960	406360	Those who buy the product are required to sign an agreement to not save or share any
406360	411100	seed and those who do get caught and are met by a hefty lawsuit.
411100	414120	But this isn't really different than any other product.
414120	416600	This is their form of rights management.
416600	420800	When you watch a video on Netflix, in the terms of use, you've agreed to only use
420800	426240	the product for yourself just like the farmers agree to only use the Monsanto seed for themselves,
426240	430240	even though, with both products, it's rather easy to share.
430240	434360	Just like with patented gene sequences, there's the question of where the line is between
434360	437400	patents improving and harming the greater good.
437400	442240	If companies are not able to recuperate research and development costs, they won't research
442240	443240	or develop.
443360	447600	In a free market, farmers can choose whether or not to buy the Monsanto seeds given the
447600	453160	terms and, overwhelmingly, they do because the seeds make more money than they cost.
453160	455240	It's just simple math.
455240	459760	You should form your own opinion on patented genetically modified plants and seeds, but
459760	465700	it's indisputable that there are upsides that can be argued, though, what about animals?
465700	470400	In 1980, the US Supreme Court decided that genetically modified animals could be patented
470400	474080	if they were altered in a meaningful way from their original selves.
474080	476420	European patent law considers the same true.
476420	482060	In fact, you might already be eating genetically modified animals without even knowing it.
482060	486840	The company AquaBounty Technologies successfully created a variant of salmon that grows at
486840	492880	a faster rate and so they patented it—the Aqua Advantage salmon—and in 2016 it hit
492880	494880	the shelves in Canada.
494880	499600	Researchers have found the salmon safe to eat, but it is, of course, different.
499600	503700	If the genetically modified salmon were to be accidentally released into the wild, some
503700	509020	are concerned that their genetic makeup could be spread by out-competing the normal salmon—although,
509020	513160	in computer models it was concluded that the normal salmon would prevail since it has a
513160	515040	higher fertility rate.
515040	519680	In the US, the Aqua Advantage salmon has been approved by the FDA, but it cannot be sold
519680	523720	until labeling standards for genetically modified food are developed.
523720	526280	But just imagine the next step.
526280	530320	Genetically modified humans are coming and whether or not companies will be allowed to
530320	535720	patent their processes will have a huge effect on how commonplace human gene editing will
535720	536720	become.
536720	541480	The Myriad Genetics case only decided that patents on naturally occurring gene sequences
541480	546600	were not allowed, but the decision that allowed patents on genetically modified animals specifically
546600	551980	excluded humans meaning that as of now you would not be granted a patent for human gene
551980	556240	editing in the US, but there are plenty of other countries.
556240	559020	Most have not even considered this question.
559020	564400	If you imagine a world with patented commercial human gene editing, you are imagining a world
564400	569680	where you can decide if your child will have blue eyes or not, if they're tall or not,
569680	575200	if they're smart or not, if they are autistic or not, if they will have heart disease or
575200	581520	not, if they will have Alzheimer's or not, if they will have cancer or not.
581520	586640	The real question is not if it's ethical to allow patented human gene editing, it's
586640	589560	if it's ethical to not.
589560	593440	If you want to learn more about genetic research, there's a great course that I recommend
