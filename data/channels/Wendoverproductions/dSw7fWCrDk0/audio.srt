4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,000
On July 12th, 2017, Amtrak got a new CEO.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,440
The American government-owned rail company would now be helmed by Richard Anderson.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,440
Anderson was no stranger to the American transport industry.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
He had previously worked for nine years as the CEO of Delta Airlines, leading it from

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,280
bankruptcy to prosperity.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,520
This job, of turning around a struggling company, is rarely a popular one.

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,440
It requires making difficult decisions that plenty will not agree with, but it's a job

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,000
that some leaders have a knack for.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,860
Having succeeded with this task at Delta, there was at least some evidence that Richard

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,680
Anderson could complete the same task elsewhere.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,680
That's why he was brought to Amtrak.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,160
Amtrak is certainly a company in need of turnaround.

16
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,400
While it is government-owned, it is intended to operate as a for-profit company.

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:03,120
Despite that, however, it has never turned a profit since its inception in 1971.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,340
Each year, the difference between what it makes from running its trains and what it

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,280
costs to run those trains is made up by government subsidies, grants, and debt.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,880
The company's primary purpose, beyond making money, is of course to carry passengers, and

21
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
they don't even do that all that well.

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,400
In 2018, only 73% of their trains arrived on time.

23
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,960
In the case of their long-distance trains, just 43% got to their destination on time.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,480
In fairness, the majority of the company's delays are the fault of the freight rail companies

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,680
that own the tracks that carry their trains, but still, it's sure that the company could

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,040
use some work.

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
So, Richard Anderson has been getting to work.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,860
To understand how Amtrak works as a company, you have to understand the types of trains

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,000
it operates.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,160
There are essentially three categories.

31
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,300
The first are the Northeast Corridor trains.

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,420
This route, connecting Boston, New York, DC, and a number of smaller cities up and

33
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,900
down the east coast, is operated by both higher-speed Acela and slower Northeast regional trains,

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,740
and overall, the Northeast Corridor is by far Amtrak's most profitable route.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,080
The slower regional trains they operate earn them a profit of almost $25 per passenger.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,380
On the higher-speed Acela, they profit more than $80 per passenger.

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,300
Without this route, Amtrak would be in a far poorer financial state.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,740
The second type of trains are the state-supported ones.

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,560
Essentially what these are are shorter routes supported by the subsidies offered by state

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,860
governments.

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,980
Every single short-distance train outside the Northeast Corridor is state-supported,

42
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,820
and this type includes routes like Charlotte to Raleigh, North Carolina, Chicago to Quincy,

43
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,700
Illinois, or Vancouver, Canada to Portland, Oregon.

44
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,020
These routes range in profitability.

45
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:47,780
The DC to Lynchburg train, for example, earns the company almost $40 in profit per passenger.

46
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,380
Meanwhile, the Fort Worth, Texas to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma one loses more than $30 per

47
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
passenger.

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,420
Overall, though, the state-supported routes as a grouping are unprofitable, but not by

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,700
that much.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,140
They are somewhat close to break-even.

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,840
The third type of trains is the long-distance ones.

52
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,260
Ranging from 13 hours to 65, these routes connect big cities to small towns all across

53
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,540
the US.

54
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,900
Many of these routes have storied histories and strong fanbases of those who prefer the

55
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:23,360
more relaxed method of travel, however, these routes certainly do not help Amtrak's financial

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,860
performance.

57
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,020
Every single one of Amtrak's long-distance routes lose money.

58
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,380
How much money they lose ranges anywhere from $12 per passenger in the case of the Palmetto

59
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,480
between New York City and Savannah, Georgia, all the way to $456 per passenger in the case

60
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,440
of the Sunset Limited from New Orleans, Louisiana to Los Angeles.

61
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Overall, Amtrak loses more than a half-billion dollars a year operating these long-distance

62
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,640
routes.

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,020
Part of what makes Richard Anderson the perfect figure to turn around Amtrak is that he does

64
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,880
not care about trains.

65
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,880
That's to say, he has no sense of sentimentality about the history or the grandeur or the allure

66
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,440
of particular storied routes.

67
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,040
His passion is for profitability, and that's his goal, seemingly no matter the cost.

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,640
Therefore, three core parts to Anderson's Amtrak plan have emerged—expanding the Northeast

69
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:23,040
Corridor services, optimizing the state-supported services, and cutting back the long-distance

70
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,640
services.

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,080
Starting with the Northeast Corridor, this is clearly Amtrak's greatest asset.

72
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,040
The company owns most of the tracks between DC and Boston, meaning that they don't run

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,340
into the same problems of using freight railroads tracks like with almost all their other services.

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,060
This means that they can run these services relatively reliably and therefore have a clear

75
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,400
advantage over planes or buses when traveling between New York and DC or Boston.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,320
Consequently, they have cornered the market between Boston, New York, and DC.

77
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,500
The first part of Amtrak's plan to double down on this route was initiated before Anderson

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,080
even joined the company.

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,240
Amtrak is receiving new, faster, and larger trainsets for their higher-speed Acela Express

80
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,900
service on the route in 2021.

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,720
With the introduction of these, Amtrak has teased plans to create four tiers of transport

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,200
for the corridor.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,320
The lowest would be the new local train operating all the way from Richmond, Virginia to Portland,

84
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,000
Maine, making most all stops along the way.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,560
The idea for this sort of super-local train would be to connect additional smaller communities

86
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,680
to the Amtrak network, as this service could be used to connect to other higher-speed trains.

87
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,620
The next tier up would be existing Northeast Regional service, operating between Boston

88
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,860
and DC, with some continuing on into Virginia.

89
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,200
Above that would be the current Acela Express, operating limited stop service between Boston

90
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,040
and DC, then above that would be the new non-stop services from DC and Boston to New York.

91
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,040
The company launched the first of these in September, 2019, with a travel time of two

92
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,840
hours and 35 minutes—shaving about 15 minutes off the travel time of the stopping Acelas.

93
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,560
In the future, the addition of non-stop services from Boston and additional frequencies from

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,440
DC will cement this as the most premium option in the Northeast Corridor, and the idea is

95
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,640
that these four tiered options together will help capture more of every customer segment—thereby

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,220
squeezing more revenue out of Amtrak's most profitable route.

97
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,640
The fact that some of Amtrak's state-supported trains break even is a fantastic sign because

98
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,420
it means, with optimization, that Amtrak can turn this grouping profitable.

99
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,600
Anderson has made noise about expanding Amtrak's short-distance network across the US.

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,000
The company has not announced any specific new routes as part of a major short-distance

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,160
expansion, but it's clear that there are opportunities.

102
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,760
Trains tend to be competitive in time and cost to flights under a distance of about

103
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,560
300 miles or 500 kilometers.

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,880
That means that there are plenty of likely profitable routes that Amtrak could set up,

105
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,680
like Dallas to Houston or Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

106
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,340
While it's unlikely that Amtrak could set up any additional short-distance routes without

107
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,040
state funding, the company does have potential future competition.

108
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,000
Two private companies are fairly serious about starting up high-speed train service on these

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
routes.

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,020
Between Dallas and Houston, a company called Texas Central Railway is months away from

111
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,740
starting construction on a high-speed line connecting the cities in just 90 minutes.

112
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,160
Elsewhere, Virgin Trains USA, the company that owns what is currently the only privately

113
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,900
owned intercity railroad in the US between Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach,

114
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,860
recently acquired a company that had begun planning and permitting work for a Los Angeles

115
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,020
area to Las Vegas high-speed line, and is looking to start construction in 2020.

116
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,980
If these projects are completed, which seems quite possible, two of Amtrak's most potentially

117
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,880
profitable routes would be snapped up and, if successful, it would open the door to future

118
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,580
private rail projects in the US.

119
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,700
While significant rail investment and development would no doubt prove quite beneficial for

120
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,680
the country and help solve many of its transport problems, to Amtrak, it would get in the way

121
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,700
of their ability to cherry-pick the most profitable short-haul routes in order to offset the loss

122
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,540
of long-distance ones.

123
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,180
That brings us to those long-distance routes.

124
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,080
This is where things get tricky for Amtrak.

125
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,720
As a publicly owned company enjoying quite sizable amounts of public funding, Amtrak

126
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,600
relies on keeping in the good graces of the US Congress.

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,300
Their long-distance routes pass through more than 40 states and cutting them would be politically

128
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,320
unpopular anywhere.

129
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,140
Not only do they serve as economic stimulus by providing jobs to rural areas, but many

130
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,680
of the country's 500 stops represent the only public transport link to the outside

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,240
world from the small towns they're in.

132
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,820
Congresspeople are well aware that the loss of a route that their constituents use would

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,120
not help with their popularity.

134
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,480
At the very same time, Congress has been putting the pressure on Amtrak to cut its losses,

135
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,280
even though the very thing losing all their money are these long-distance routes.

136
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,600
Therefore, for now, the company has started making efforts to cut costs on these trains.

137
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
As one example, they've started to move their long-distance trains away from serving

138
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,540
fresh meals from their onboard kitchen towards stocking prepackaged, pre-prepared foods.

139
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,720
This undoubtedly did not go down well with Amtrak loyalists, but the whole long-distance

140
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,520
mess gets even messier.

141
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,700
The company has been accused of, essentially, misleading accounting practices.

142
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,120
This would presumably be in order to make the long-distance routes seem like bigger

143
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,380
money losers than they truly are in order to help the case for their discontinuation.

144
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,900
The company attributes different costs to different lines to give a sense of which make

145
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,180
money and which don't, but this isn't always done well.

146
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,540
For example, it apparently cost $3 million a year to maintain the company's electric

147
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,880
train equipment outside the Northeast Corridor even though, aside from a small branch line

148
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,460
to Harrisburg, there are no Amtrak electric train routes outside the Northeast Corridor—only

149
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
diesel.

150
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,780
It also attributed all the cost of its baggage handling services to its long-distance trains,

151
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,360
even though these are used on many short-distance services as well.

152
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,740
The biggest highlight of their cost attribution, though, is what they mark down as the cost

153
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,700
they bore for their station in Miami—the terminus of some of the long-distance routes—to

154
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,720
be cleaned of snow.

155
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,460
The last time it snowed anywhere close to Miami was 1977.

156
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:26,700
What's likely to happen, in the near future, is that Amtrak will cut the most egregious

157
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,300
losers in its long-distance portfolio while keeping those that are closer to break even

158
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,420
in order to appease Congress.

159
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,420
The termination of any route would be a huge loss to many.

160
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,320
They each provide hundreds or thousands of jobs and connect many of the country's smallest

161
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,560
towns to bigger cities, but it's likely a necessity given the pressure from DC.

162
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,060
The new leader of Amtrak, Richard Anderson, has, though, helped lead the company towards

163
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:55,420
the goal that long seemed impossible.

164
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,100
In the company's last fiscal year, it lost just $30 million.

165
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,620
In Amtrak terms, that is nothing, and it puts them on track to break even in 2020—an achievement

166
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,400
that the company has never reached since its inception 50 years ago.

167
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,460
This will occur during what is clearly a time of great change for Amtrak—it is reinventing

168
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:22,000
itself at the beginning of a period of reinvention for the American rail industry as a whole.

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,580
What many are worried about, though, is that it and the Congresspeople behind it will forget

170
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,640
the difference between a private company and a government-owned one.

171
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,720
If Amtrak was a true for-profit company, it would have long ago made the quite easy decision

172
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,040
to cut every single long-distance route.

173
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,160
Doing so would immediately turn them into a quite profitable corporation, but the company's

174
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:50,560
purpose is to connect America, and there's a whole lot more to America than a four-hour

175
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,880
radius around the largest cities.

176
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,140
Anyone who's traveled a lot and possibly experienced the ups and downs of Amtrak knows

177
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,100
that not all suitcases are created equal.

178
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,740
You can get really cheap and flimsy suitcases, or really expensive, overpriced suitcases,

179
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,060
but the key to a perfect suitcase is to land somewhere in between.

180
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:15,820
After almost three years of usage, I'm pretty certain that Away makes the perfect suitcase.

181
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,340
I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles with Away suitcases, and in fact, as I record

182
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,260
this, I'm traveling around Europe using their medium bag.

183
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,020
All their sizes come packed with features—they have four fantastic spinner wheels, a built-in

184
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,300
TSA lock, compression straps on the inside, and even an ejectable battery in the case

185
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,300
of their carry-ons.

186
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,620
It all fits together in one durable, lightweight package, and they're so confident that it

187
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,580
includes a 100-day return window and a lifetime warranty.

188
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:49,620
