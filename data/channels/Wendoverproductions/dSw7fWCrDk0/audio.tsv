10360	15000	On July 12th, 2017, Amtrak got a new CEO.
15000	19440	The American government-owned rail company would now be helmed by Richard Anderson.
19440	22440	Anderson was no stranger to the American transport industry.
22440	27440	He had previously worked for nine years as the CEO of Delta Airlines, leading it from
27440	29280	bankruptcy to prosperity.
29280	33520	This job, of turning around a struggling company, is rarely a popular one.
33520	37440	It requires making difficult decisions that plenty will not agree with, but it's a job
37440	40000	that some leaders have a knack for.
40000	43860	Having succeeded with this task at Delta, there was at least some evidence that Richard
43860	46680	Anderson could complete the same task elsewhere.
46680	49680	That's why he was brought to Amtrak.
49680	53160	Amtrak is certainly a company in need of turnaround.
53160	57400	While it is government-owned, it is intended to operate as a for-profit company.
57400	63120	Despite that, however, it has never turned a profit since its inception in 1971.
63120	66340	Each year, the difference between what it makes from running its trains and what it
66340	71280	costs to run those trains is made up by government subsidies, grants, and debt.
71280	75880	The company's primary purpose, beyond making money, is of course to carry passengers, and
75880	78240	they don't even do that all that well.
78240	82400	In 2018, only 73% of their trains arrived on time.
82400	87960	In the case of their long-distance trains, just 43% got to their destination on time.
87960	91480	In fairness, the majority of the company's delays are the fault of the freight rail companies
91480	95680	that own the tracks that carry their trains, but still, it's sure that the company could
95680	97040	use some work.
97040	100400	So, Richard Anderson has been getting to work.
100400	104860	To understand how Amtrak works as a company, you have to understand the types of trains
104860	106000	it operates.
106000	108160	There are essentially three categories.
108160	111300	The first are the Northeast Corridor trains.
111300	115420	This route, connecting Boston, New York, DC, and a number of smaller cities up and
115420	120900	down the east coast, is operated by both higher-speed Acela and slower Northeast regional trains,
120900	125740	and overall, the Northeast Corridor is by far Amtrak's most profitable route.
125740	131080	The slower regional trains they operate earn them a profit of almost $25 per passenger.
131080	135380	On the higher-speed Acela, they profit more than $80 per passenger.
135380	140300	Without this route, Amtrak would be in a far poorer financial state.
140300	143740	The second type of trains are the state-supported ones.
143740	147560	Essentially what these are are shorter routes supported by the subsidies offered by state
147560	148860	governments.
148860	152980	Every single short-distance train outside the Northeast Corridor is state-supported,
152980	156820	and this type includes routes like Charlotte to Raleigh, North Carolina, Chicago to Quincy,
156820	159700	Illinois, or Vancouver, Canada to Portland, Oregon.
159700	162020	These routes range in profitability.
162020	167780	The DC to Lynchburg train, for example, earns the company almost $40 in profit per passenger.
167780	173380	Meanwhile, the Fort Worth, Texas to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma one loses more than $30 per
173380	174380	passenger.
174380	179420	Overall, though, the state-supported routes as a grouping are unprofitable, but not by
179420	180700	that much.
180700	183140	They are somewhat close to break-even.
183140	186840	The third type of trains is the long-distance ones.
186840	192260	Ranging from 13 hours to 65, these routes connect big cities to small towns all across
192260	193540	the US.
193540	197900	Many of these routes have storied histories and strong fanbases of those who prefer the
197900	203360	more relaxed method of travel, however, these routes certainly do not help Amtrak's financial
203360	204860	performance.
204860	209020	Every single one of Amtrak's long-distance routes lose money.
209020	213380	How much money they lose ranges anywhere from $12 per passenger in the case of the Palmetto
213380	219480	between New York City and Savannah, Georgia, all the way to $456 per passenger in the case
219480	223440	of the Sunset Limited from New Orleans, Louisiana to Los Angeles.
223440	229320	Overall, Amtrak loses more than a half-billion dollars a year operating these long-distance
229320	230640	routes.
230640	236020	Part of what makes Richard Anderson the perfect figure to turn around Amtrak is that he does
236020	237880	not care about trains.
237880	243880	That's to say, he has no sense of sentimentality about the history or the grandeur or the allure
243880	246440	of particular storied routes.
246440	252040	His passion is for profitability, and that's his goal, seemingly no matter the cost.
252040	257640	Therefore, three core parts to Anderson's Amtrak plan have emerged—expanding the Northeast
257640	263040	Corridor services, optimizing the state-supported services, and cutting back the long-distance
263040	264640	services.
264640	270080	Starting with the Northeast Corridor, this is clearly Amtrak's greatest asset.
270080	274040	The company owns most of the tracks between DC and Boston, meaning that they don't run
274040	279340	into the same problems of using freight railroads tracks like with almost all their other services.
279340	283060	This means that they can run these services relatively reliably and therefore have a clear
283060	287400	advantage over planes or buses when traveling between New York and DC or Boston.
287400	292320	Consequently, they have cornered the market between Boston, New York, and DC.
292320	296500	The first part of Amtrak's plan to double down on this route was initiated before Anderson
296500	298080	even joined the company.
298080	303240	Amtrak is receiving new, faster, and larger trainsets for their higher-speed Acela Express
303240	305900	service on the route in 2021.
305900	310720	With the introduction of these, Amtrak has teased plans to create four tiers of transport
310720	312200	for the corridor.
312200	317320	The lowest would be the new local train operating all the way from Richmond, Virginia to Portland,
317320	320000	Maine, making most all stops along the way.
320000	324560	The idea for this sort of super-local train would be to connect additional smaller communities
324560	329680	to the Amtrak network, as this service could be used to connect to other higher-speed trains.
329680	333620	The next tier up would be existing Northeast Regional service, operating between Boston
333620	336860	and DC, with some continuing on into Virginia.
336860	341200	Above that would be the current Acela Express, operating limited stop service between Boston
341200	347040	and DC, then above that would be the new non-stop services from DC and Boston to New York.
347040	351040	The company launched the first of these in September, 2019, with a travel time of two
351040	356840	hours and 35 minutes—shaving about 15 minutes off the travel time of the stopping Acelas.
356840	361560	In the future, the addition of non-stop services from Boston and additional frequencies from
361560	366440	DC will cement this as the most premium option in the Northeast Corridor, and the idea is
366440	372640	that these four tiered options together will help capture more of every customer segment—thereby
372640	376220	squeezing more revenue out of Amtrak's most profitable route.
376220	381640	The fact that some of Amtrak's state-supported trains break even is a fantastic sign because
381640	387420	it means, with optimization, that Amtrak can turn this grouping profitable.
387420	392600	Anderson has made noise about expanding Amtrak's short-distance network across the US.
392600	397000	The company has not announced any specific new routes as part of a major short-distance
397000	401160	expansion, but it's clear that there are opportunities.
401160	405760	Trains tend to be competitive in time and cost to flights under a distance of about
405760	408560	300 miles or 500 kilometers.
408560	412880	That means that there are plenty of likely profitable routes that Amtrak could set up,
412880	415680	like Dallas to Houston or Los Angeles to Las Vegas.
415680	420340	While it's unlikely that Amtrak could set up any additional short-distance routes without
420340	425040	state funding, the company does have potential future competition.
425040	430000	Two private companies are fairly serious about starting up high-speed train service on these
430000	431000	routes.
431000	435020	Between Dallas and Houston, a company called Texas Central Railway is months away from
435020	439740	starting construction on a high-speed line connecting the cities in just 90 minutes.
439740	444160	Elsewhere, Virgin Trains USA, the company that owns what is currently the only privately
444160	448900	owned intercity railroad in the US between Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach,
448900	452860	recently acquired a company that had begun planning and permitting work for a Los Angeles
452860	458020	area to Las Vegas high-speed line, and is looking to start construction in 2020.
458020	462980	If these projects are completed, which seems quite possible, two of Amtrak's most potentially
462980	467880	profitable routes would be snapped up and, if successful, it would open the door to future
467880	470580	private rail projects in the US.
470580	474700	While significant rail investment and development would no doubt prove quite beneficial for
474700	479680	the country and help solve many of its transport problems, to Amtrak, it would get in the way
479680	484700	of their ability to cherry-pick the most profitable short-haul routes in order to offset the loss
484700	486540	of long-distance ones.
486540	490180	That brings us to those long-distance routes.
490180	493080	This is where things get tricky for Amtrak.
493080	497720	As a publicly owned company enjoying quite sizable amounts of public funding, Amtrak
497720	501600	relies on keeping in the good graces of the US Congress.
501600	506300	Their long-distance routes pass through more than 40 states and cutting them would be politically
506300	508320	unpopular anywhere.
508320	513140	Not only do they serve as economic stimulus by providing jobs to rural areas, but many
513140	517680	of the country's 500 stops represent the only public transport link to the outside
517680	520240	world from the small towns they're in.
520240	524820	Congresspeople are well aware that the loss of a route that their constituents use would
524820	527120	not help with their popularity.
527120	531480	At the very same time, Congress has been putting the pressure on Amtrak to cut its losses,
531480	536280	even though the very thing losing all their money are these long-distance routes.
536280	541600	Therefore, for now, the company has started making efforts to cut costs on these trains.
541600	545360	As one example, they've started to move their long-distance trains away from serving
545360	550540	fresh meals from their onboard kitchen towards stocking prepackaged, pre-prepared foods.
550540	555720	This undoubtedly did not go down well with Amtrak loyalists, but the whole long-distance
555720	558520	mess gets even messier.
558520	563700	The company has been accused of, essentially, misleading accounting practices.
563700	568120	This would presumably be in order to make the long-distance routes seem like bigger
568120	573380	money losers than they truly are in order to help the case for their discontinuation.
573380	577900	The company attributes different costs to different lines to give a sense of which make
577900	582180	money and which don't, but this isn't always done well.
582180	586540	For example, it apparently cost $3 million a year to maintain the company's electric
586540	590880	train equipment outside the Northeast Corridor even though, aside from a small branch line
590880	596460	to Harrisburg, there are no Amtrak electric train routes outside the Northeast Corridor—only
596460	597460	diesel.
597460	602780	It also attributed all the cost of its baggage handling services to its long-distance trains,
602780	606360	even though these are used on many short-distance services as well.
606360	610740	The biggest highlight of their cost attribution, though, is what they mark down as the cost
610740	615700	they bore for their station in Miami—the terminus of some of the long-distance routes—to
615700	617720	be cleaned of snow.
617720	621460	The last time it snowed anywhere close to Miami was 1977.
621460	626700	What's likely to happen, in the near future, is that Amtrak will cut the most egregious
626700	631300	losers in its long-distance portfolio while keeping those that are closer to break even
631300	633420	in order to appease Congress.
633420	637420	The termination of any route would be a huge loss to many.
637420	642320	They each provide hundreds or thousands of jobs and connect many of the country's smallest
642320	647560	towns to bigger cities, but it's likely a necessity given the pressure from DC.
647560	652060	The new leader of Amtrak, Richard Anderson, has, though, helped lead the company towards
652060	655420	the goal that long seemed impossible.
655420	661100	In the company's last fiscal year, it lost just $30 million.
661100	666620	In Amtrak terms, that is nothing, and it puts them on track to break even in 2020—an achievement
666620	671400	that the company has never reached since its inception 50 years ago.
671400	676460	This will occur during what is clearly a time of great change for Amtrak—it is reinventing
676460	682000	itself at the beginning of a period of reinvention for the American rail industry as a whole.
682000	686580	What many are worried about, though, is that it and the Congresspeople behind it will forget
686580	690640	the difference between a private company and a government-owned one.
691180	696720	If Amtrak was a true for-profit company, it would have long ago made the quite easy decision
696720	700040	to cut every single long-distance route.
700040	705160	Doing so would immediately turn them into a quite profitable corporation, but the company's
705160	710560	purpose is to connect America, and there's a whole lot more to America than a four-hour
710560	713880	radius around the largest cities.
713880	718140	Anyone who's traveled a lot and possibly experienced the ups and downs of Amtrak knows
718140	721100	that not all suitcases are created equal.
721100	725740	You can get really cheap and flimsy suitcases, or really expensive, overpriced suitcases,
725740	730060	but the key to a perfect suitcase is to land somewhere in between.
730060	735820	After almost three years of usage, I'm pretty certain that Away makes the perfect suitcase.
735820	741340	I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles with Away suitcases, and in fact, as I record
741340	744260	this, I'm traveling around Europe using their medium bag.
744260	749020	All their sizes come packed with features—they have four fantastic spinner wheels, a built-in
749020	753300	TSA lock, compression straps on the inside, and even an ejectable battery in the case
753300	754300	of their carry-ons.
754300	759620	It all fits together in one durable, lightweight package, and they're so confident that it
759620	763580	includes a 100-day return window and a lifetime warranty.
