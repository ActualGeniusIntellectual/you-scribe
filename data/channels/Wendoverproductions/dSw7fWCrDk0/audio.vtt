00:10.360 --> 00:15.000
On July 12th, 2017, Amtrak got a new CEO.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.440
The American government-owned rail company would now be helmed by Richard Anderson.

00:19.440 --> 00:22.440
Anderson was no stranger to the American transport industry.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.440
He had previously worked for nine years as the CEO of Delta Airlines, leading it from

00:27.440 --> 00:29.280
bankruptcy to prosperity.

00:29.280 --> 00:33.520
This job, of turning around a struggling company, is rarely a popular one.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.440
It requires making difficult decisions that plenty will not agree with, but it's a job

00:37.440 --> 00:40.000
that some leaders have a knack for.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.860
Having succeeded with this task at Delta, there was at least some evidence that Richard

00:43.860 --> 00:46.680
Anderson could complete the same task elsewhere.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.680
That's why he was brought to Amtrak.

00:49.680 --> 00:53.160
Amtrak is certainly a company in need of turnaround.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.400
While it is government-owned, it is intended to operate as a for-profit company.

00:57.400 --> 01:03.120
Despite that, however, it has never turned a profit since its inception in 1971.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.340
Each year, the difference between what it makes from running its trains and what it

01:06.340 --> 01:11.280
costs to run those trains is made up by government subsidies, grants, and debt.

01:11.280 --> 01:15.880
The company's primary purpose, beyond making money, is of course to carry passengers, and

01:15.880 --> 01:18.240
they don't even do that all that well.

01:18.240 --> 01:22.400
In 2018, only 73% of their trains arrived on time.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.960
In the case of their long-distance trains, just 43% got to their destination on time.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.480
In fairness, the majority of the company's delays are the fault of the freight rail companies

01:31.480 --> 01:35.680
that own the tracks that carry their trains, but still, it's sure that the company could

01:35.680 --> 01:37.040
use some work.

01:37.040 --> 01:40.400
So, Richard Anderson has been getting to work.

01:40.400 --> 01:44.860
To understand how Amtrak works as a company, you have to understand the types of trains

01:44.860 --> 01:46.000
it operates.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.160
There are essentially three categories.

01:48.160 --> 01:51.300
The first are the Northeast Corridor trains.

01:51.300 --> 01:55.420
This route, connecting Boston, New York, DC, and a number of smaller cities up and

01:55.420 --> 02:00.900
down the east coast, is operated by both higher-speed Acela and slower Northeast regional trains,

02:00.900 --> 02:05.740
and overall, the Northeast Corridor is by far Amtrak's most profitable route.

02:05.740 --> 02:11.080
The slower regional trains they operate earn them a profit of almost $25 per passenger.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.380
On the higher-speed Acela, they profit more than $80 per passenger.

02:15.380 --> 02:20.300
Without this route, Amtrak would be in a far poorer financial state.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.740
The second type of trains are the state-supported ones.

02:23.740 --> 02:27.560
Essentially what these are are shorter routes supported by the subsidies offered by state

02:27.560 --> 02:28.860
governments.

02:28.860 --> 02:32.980
Every single short-distance train outside the Northeast Corridor is state-supported,

02:32.980 --> 02:36.820
and this type includes routes like Charlotte to Raleigh, North Carolina, Chicago to Quincy,

02:36.820 --> 02:39.700
Illinois, or Vancouver, Canada to Portland, Oregon.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.020
These routes range in profitability.

02:42.020 --> 02:47.780
The DC to Lynchburg train, for example, earns the company almost $40 in profit per passenger.

02:47.780 --> 02:53.380
Meanwhile, the Fort Worth, Texas to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma one loses more than $30 per

02:53.380 --> 02:54.380
passenger.

02:54.380 --> 02:59.420
Overall, though, the state-supported routes as a grouping are unprofitable, but not by

02:59.420 --> 03:00.700
that much.

03:00.700 --> 03:03.140
They are somewhat close to break-even.

03:03.140 --> 03:06.840
The third type of trains is the long-distance ones.

03:06.840 --> 03:12.260
Ranging from 13 hours to 65, these routes connect big cities to small towns all across

03:12.260 --> 03:13.540
the US.

03:13.540 --> 03:17.900
Many of these routes have storied histories and strong fanbases of those who prefer the

03:17.900 --> 03:23.360
more relaxed method of travel, however, these routes certainly do not help Amtrak's financial

03:23.360 --> 03:24.860
performance.

03:24.860 --> 03:29.020
Every single one of Amtrak's long-distance routes lose money.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.380
How much money they lose ranges anywhere from $12 per passenger in the case of the Palmetto

03:33.380 --> 03:39.480
between New York City and Savannah, Georgia, all the way to $456 per passenger in the case

03:39.480 --> 03:43.440
of the Sunset Limited from New Orleans, Louisiana to Los Angeles.

03:43.440 --> 03:49.320
Overall, Amtrak loses more than a half-billion dollars a year operating these long-distance

03:49.320 --> 03:50.640
routes.

03:50.640 --> 03:56.020
Part of what makes Richard Anderson the perfect figure to turn around Amtrak is that he does

03:56.020 --> 03:57.880
not care about trains.

03:57.880 --> 04:03.880
That's to say, he has no sense of sentimentality about the history or the grandeur or the allure

04:03.880 --> 04:06.440
of particular storied routes.

04:06.440 --> 04:12.040
His passion is for profitability, and that's his goal, seemingly no matter the cost.

04:12.040 --> 04:17.640
Therefore, three core parts to Anderson's Amtrak plan have emerged—expanding the Northeast

04:17.640 --> 04:23.040
Corridor services, optimizing the state-supported services, and cutting back the long-distance

04:23.040 --> 04:24.640
services.

04:24.640 --> 04:30.080
Starting with the Northeast Corridor, this is clearly Amtrak's greatest asset.

04:30.080 --> 04:34.040
The company owns most of the tracks between DC and Boston, meaning that they don't run

04:34.040 --> 04:39.340
into the same problems of using freight railroads tracks like with almost all their other services.

04:39.340 --> 04:43.060
This means that they can run these services relatively reliably and therefore have a clear

04:43.060 --> 04:47.400
advantage over planes or buses when traveling between New York and DC or Boston.

04:47.400 --> 04:52.320
Consequently, they have cornered the market between Boston, New York, and DC.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.500
The first part of Amtrak's plan to double down on this route was initiated before Anderson

04:56.500 --> 04:58.080
even joined the company.

04:58.080 --> 05:03.240
Amtrak is receiving new, faster, and larger trainsets for their higher-speed Acela Express

05:03.240 --> 05:05.900
service on the route in 2021.

05:05.900 --> 05:10.720
With the introduction of these, Amtrak has teased plans to create four tiers of transport

05:10.720 --> 05:12.200
for the corridor.

05:12.200 --> 05:17.320
The lowest would be the new local train operating all the way from Richmond, Virginia to Portland,

05:17.320 --> 05:20.000
Maine, making most all stops along the way.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.560
The idea for this sort of super-local train would be to connect additional smaller communities

05:24.560 --> 05:29.680
to the Amtrak network, as this service could be used to connect to other higher-speed trains.

05:29.680 --> 05:33.620
The next tier up would be existing Northeast Regional service, operating between Boston

05:33.620 --> 05:36.860
and DC, with some continuing on into Virginia.

05:36.860 --> 05:41.200
Above that would be the current Acela Express, operating limited stop service between Boston

05:41.200 --> 05:47.040
and DC, then above that would be the new non-stop services from DC and Boston to New York.

05:47.040 --> 05:51.040
The company launched the first of these in September, 2019, with a travel time of two

05:51.040 --> 05:56.840
hours and 35 minutes—shaving about 15 minutes off the travel time of the stopping Acelas.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.560
In the future, the addition of non-stop services from Boston and additional frequencies from

06:01.560 --> 06:06.440
DC will cement this as the most premium option in the Northeast Corridor, and the idea is

06:06.440 --> 06:12.640
that these four tiered options together will help capture more of every customer segment—thereby

06:12.640 --> 06:16.220
squeezing more revenue out of Amtrak's most profitable route.

06:16.220 --> 06:21.640
The fact that some of Amtrak's state-supported trains break even is a fantastic sign because

06:21.640 --> 06:27.420
it means, with optimization, that Amtrak can turn this grouping profitable.

06:27.420 --> 06:32.600
Anderson has made noise about expanding Amtrak's short-distance network across the US.

06:32.600 --> 06:37.000
The company has not announced any specific new routes as part of a major short-distance

06:37.000 --> 06:41.160
expansion, but it's clear that there are opportunities.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.760
Trains tend to be competitive in time and cost to flights under a distance of about

06:45.760 --> 06:48.560
300 miles or 500 kilometers.

06:48.560 --> 06:52.880
That means that there are plenty of likely profitable routes that Amtrak could set up,

06:52.880 --> 06:55.680
like Dallas to Houston or Los Angeles to Las Vegas.

06:55.680 --> 07:00.340
While it's unlikely that Amtrak could set up any additional short-distance routes without

07:00.340 --> 07:05.040
state funding, the company does have potential future competition.

07:05.040 --> 07:10.000
Two private companies are fairly serious about starting up high-speed train service on these

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
routes.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.020
Between Dallas and Houston, a company called Texas Central Railway is months away from

07:15.020 --> 07:19.740
starting construction on a high-speed line connecting the cities in just 90 minutes.

07:19.740 --> 07:24.160
Elsewhere, Virgin Trains USA, the company that owns what is currently the only privately

07:24.160 --> 07:28.900
owned intercity railroad in the US between Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and West Palm Beach,

07:28.900 --> 07:32.860
recently acquired a company that had begun planning and permitting work for a Los Angeles

07:32.860 --> 07:38.020
area to Las Vegas high-speed line, and is looking to start construction in 2020.

07:38.020 --> 07:42.980
If these projects are completed, which seems quite possible, two of Amtrak's most potentially

07:42.980 --> 07:47.880
profitable routes would be snapped up and, if successful, it would open the door to future

07:47.880 --> 07:50.580
private rail projects in the US.

07:50.580 --> 07:54.700
While significant rail investment and development would no doubt prove quite beneficial for

07:54.700 --> 07:59.680
the country and help solve many of its transport problems, to Amtrak, it would get in the way

07:59.680 --> 08:04.700
of their ability to cherry-pick the most profitable short-haul routes in order to offset the loss

08:04.700 --> 08:06.540
of long-distance ones.

08:06.540 --> 08:10.180
That brings us to those long-distance routes.

08:10.180 --> 08:13.080
This is where things get tricky for Amtrak.

08:13.080 --> 08:17.720
As a publicly owned company enjoying quite sizable amounts of public funding, Amtrak

08:17.720 --> 08:21.600
relies on keeping in the good graces of the US Congress.

08:21.600 --> 08:26.300
Their long-distance routes pass through more than 40 states and cutting them would be politically

08:26.300 --> 08:28.320
unpopular anywhere.

08:28.320 --> 08:33.140
Not only do they serve as economic stimulus by providing jobs to rural areas, but many

08:33.140 --> 08:37.680
of the country's 500 stops represent the only public transport link to the outside

08:37.680 --> 08:40.240
world from the small towns they're in.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.820
Congresspeople are well aware that the loss of a route that their constituents use would

08:44.820 --> 08:47.120
not help with their popularity.

08:47.120 --> 08:51.480
At the very same time, Congress has been putting the pressure on Amtrak to cut its losses,

08:51.480 --> 08:56.280
even though the very thing losing all their money are these long-distance routes.

08:56.280 --> 09:01.600
Therefore, for now, the company has started making efforts to cut costs on these trains.

09:01.600 --> 09:05.360
As one example, they've started to move their long-distance trains away from serving

09:05.360 --> 09:10.540
fresh meals from their onboard kitchen towards stocking prepackaged, pre-prepared foods.

09:10.540 --> 09:15.720
This undoubtedly did not go down well with Amtrak loyalists, but the whole long-distance

09:15.720 --> 09:18.520
mess gets even messier.

09:18.520 --> 09:23.700
The company has been accused of, essentially, misleading accounting practices.

09:23.700 --> 09:28.120
This would presumably be in order to make the long-distance routes seem like bigger

09:28.120 --> 09:33.380
money losers than they truly are in order to help the case for their discontinuation.

09:33.380 --> 09:37.900
The company attributes different costs to different lines to give a sense of which make

09:37.900 --> 09:42.180
money and which don't, but this isn't always done well.

09:42.180 --> 09:46.540
For example, it apparently cost $3 million a year to maintain the company's electric

09:46.540 --> 09:50.880
train equipment outside the Northeast Corridor even though, aside from a small branch line

09:50.880 --> 09:56.460
to Harrisburg, there are no Amtrak electric train routes outside the Northeast Corridor—only

09:56.460 --> 09:57.460
diesel.

09:57.460 --> 10:02.780
It also attributed all the cost of its baggage handling services to its long-distance trains,

10:02.780 --> 10:06.360
even though these are used on many short-distance services as well.

10:06.360 --> 10:10.740
The biggest highlight of their cost attribution, though, is what they mark down as the cost

10:10.740 --> 10:15.700
they bore for their station in Miami—the terminus of some of the long-distance routes—to

10:15.700 --> 10:17.720
be cleaned of snow.

10:17.720 --> 10:21.460
The last time it snowed anywhere close to Miami was 1977.

10:21.460 --> 10:26.700
What's likely to happen, in the near future, is that Amtrak will cut the most egregious

10:26.700 --> 10:31.300
losers in its long-distance portfolio while keeping those that are closer to break even

10:31.300 --> 10:33.420
in order to appease Congress.

10:33.420 --> 10:37.420
The termination of any route would be a huge loss to many.

10:37.420 --> 10:42.320
They each provide hundreds or thousands of jobs and connect many of the country's smallest

10:42.320 --> 10:47.560
towns to bigger cities, but it's likely a necessity given the pressure from DC.

10:47.560 --> 10:52.060
The new leader of Amtrak, Richard Anderson, has, though, helped lead the company towards

10:52.060 --> 10:55.420
the goal that long seemed impossible.

10:55.420 --> 11:01.100
In the company's last fiscal year, it lost just $30 million.

11:01.100 --> 11:06.620
In Amtrak terms, that is nothing, and it puts them on track to break even in 2020—an achievement

11:06.620 --> 11:11.400
that the company has never reached since its inception 50 years ago.

11:11.400 --> 11:16.460
This will occur during what is clearly a time of great change for Amtrak—it is reinventing

11:16.460 --> 11:22.000
itself at the beginning of a period of reinvention for the American rail industry as a whole.

11:22.000 --> 11:26.580
What many are worried about, though, is that it and the Congresspeople behind it will forget

11:26.580 --> 11:30.640
the difference between a private company and a government-owned one.

11:31.180 --> 11:36.720
If Amtrak was a true for-profit company, it would have long ago made the quite easy decision

11:36.720 --> 11:40.040
to cut every single long-distance route.

11:40.040 --> 11:45.160
Doing so would immediately turn them into a quite profitable corporation, but the company's

11:45.160 --> 11:50.560
purpose is to connect America, and there's a whole lot more to America than a four-hour

11:50.560 --> 11:53.880
radius around the largest cities.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.140
Anyone who's traveled a lot and possibly experienced the ups and downs of Amtrak knows

11:58.140 --> 12:01.100
that not all suitcases are created equal.

12:01.100 --> 12:05.740
You can get really cheap and flimsy suitcases, or really expensive, overpriced suitcases,

12:05.740 --> 12:10.060
but the key to a perfect suitcase is to land somewhere in between.

12:10.060 --> 12:15.820
After almost three years of usage, I'm pretty certain that Away makes the perfect suitcase.

12:15.820 --> 12:21.340
I have traveled hundreds of thousands of miles with Away suitcases, and in fact, as I record

12:21.340 --> 12:24.260
this, I'm traveling around Europe using their medium bag.

12:24.260 --> 12:29.020
All their sizes come packed with features—they have four fantastic spinner wheels, a built-in

12:29.020 --> 12:33.300
TSA lock, compression straps on the inside, and even an ejectable battery in the case

12:33.300 --> 12:34.300
of their carry-ons.

12:34.300 --> 12:39.620
It all fits together in one durable, lightweight package, and they're so confident that it

12:39.620 --> 12:43.580
includes a 100-day return window and a lifetime warranty.

12:43.580 --> 12:49.620
