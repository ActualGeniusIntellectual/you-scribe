9480	14940	The United States and its entire history can be largely explained by its geography.
14940	20220	Since its inception, the fundamental factor influencing and guiding the country's development
20220	22780	is that it is far from everything else.
22780	26960	The US is bounded to the east and west by ocean and to the north and south by friendly
26960	32080	and militarily weak countries and this has meant that the US has almost never been threatened
32080	33420	on the home front.
33420	38280	Many suspect that this is why the US has such a defined government and political structure
38280	42480	because it had the time to develop the system while it wasn't worrying about potential
42480	43480	invasion.
43480	47360	But geography had a much deeper role in the formation of the United States that started
47360	49760	back before the states were even united.
49760	52520	It all started back in the colonial era.
52520	56760	The thirteen colonies were essentially split into three geographically distinct groups
56760	59960	that can explain why the areas look the way they do today.
59960	64400	The New England colonies were heavily forested and had some fantastic natural ports like
64400	65880	Boston and Newport.
65880	69760	However, the area had a short growing season and a rocky landscape which meant that the
69760	71840	crops never grew very well.
71840	76160	Therefore, the area ended up as a center for shipbuilding activity and fishing.
76160	80960	To get their food, they would trade with the breadbasket of America—the middle colonies.
80960	83960	This mid-Atlantic region was fantastic for farming.
83960	88520	The area has a long, warm growing season and plentiful, arable soil.
88520	93960	It also has navigable rivers stretching far inland that could help transport goods.
93960	98700	Philadelphia and New York were the two major cities of the colonial era and their locations
98700	99920	reflect their roles.
99920	105360	You'll notice that both New York and Philadelphia are at the mouth of significant, navigable
105360	107920	rivers while Boston is not.
107920	112240	The inland mid-Atlantic farmers transported their goods via these rivers so the major
112240	115880	cities grew as trading posts at the end of these rivers.
115880	120080	If New England had been a farming based economy, its largest city would likely have developed
120080	124500	here at the mouth of the Connecticut River but even though it was navigable, the river
124500	126520	was of little use to the area.
126520	131180	Having a major ocean going port in Boston was what was important for the maritime based
131180	132680	New England economy.
132680	137160	Further south were the southern colonies—home to some of the oldest colonial settlements.
137160	141800	Now there's this one line that you can put on a map to explain why southern cities
141800	144540	are where they are—it's called the fall line.
144540	148280	The technical explanation is that this is where the soft sedimentary rock that forms
148280	152720	the coastal plains meets the hard basement rock that forms the land farther inland.
152720	157400	The simple explanation is, however, that above this line rivers will have waterfalls and
157400	158400	rapids.
158400	161000	Below, they'll be flat and navigable.
161000	167240	Baltimore, Richmond, Durham, Raleigh, Columbia, Augusta, and a bunch of smaller cities all
167240	170660	sit almost exactly on the fall line.
170660	172320	There are two reasons for this.
172320	176280	The obvious one is that below these cities the rivers were navigable so colonists could
176280	180320	get to these cities, but what was perhaps more important was that they were far inland
180320	181880	which gave protection.
181880	186880	Spain controlled Florida for much of colonial history and had a significant military presence.
186880	190720	At the time it was reasonable to think that they would continue their expansion by moving
190720	196280	up the coast so colonial cities in the south chose their locations in part based on natural
196280	197280	fortifications.
197280	203760	But some of the most significant events in US history happened because of one fact—the
203760	205360	south is hot.
205360	209020	Very early into colonial history settlers in the south figured out that the area was
209020	213420	fantastic for tobacco cultivation and England loved tobacco.
213420	218280	The only problem was, tobacco is a much more labor-intensive crop than wheat or beans or
218280	222760	corn so the farmers brought in help… just not voluntarily.
222760	227020	The American south became one of the biggest destinations of the slave trade and plantation
227020	228880	owners were getting filthy rich.
228880	234160	A big reason slavery existed for so long in the US was actually because the south was
234160	235720	so physically big.
235720	239820	You see, the job of Supreme Court Justice used to be part-time.
239820	244560	In the 19th century the justices would only come to DC for a portion of the year and for
244560	249120	the rest of the year they would travel around an assigned area and hear cases alongside
249120	250300	local judges.
250300	255460	The problem was, the north was much more densely populated and had better travel infrastructure
255460	256460	than the south.
256460	261680	The south was vast, sparsely populated, and had very rudimentary road systems.
261680	266760	Therefore, judges assigned to the north were given a smaller area with a larger population
266760	271040	while the southern judges were given a larger area with a smaller population so that they
271040	273840	could get around their whole circuit in the same time.
273840	279640	Therefore, in the 19th century when considering the constitutionality of slavery, the south,
279640	283960	the slave-owning area, was over-represented in the Supreme Court.
283960	289940	The crucial Dred Scott case in 1857 which cemented the legality of slavery in US territory
289940	296040	was decided by a bench of five southern judges and four northern ones even though only 8
296040	300760	million of the country's 27 million free inhabitants lived in southern states.
300920	305360	Although some may call it a stretch, you can at least partially attribute the civil war
305360	310000	to the weather in the south that made tobacco and cotton cultivation possible.
310000	314100	So how did the US end up becoming the superpower it is today?
314100	318880	After the colonial era, the United States had to push out west to gain the strategic
318880	320680	advantage of isolation.
320680	326320	In 1800, what is now the US was essentially divided into three sections ruled by three
326320	329980	countries—the United States, France, and Spain.
329980	332900	In the colonial era nobody really ventured west of the Appalachians.
332900	336660	There was no real reason to and it was the unknown.
336660	342220	In fact, it wasn't until 1789 that the first explorer crossed the continent to the Pacific
342220	343300	over land.
343300	347860	The first problem preventing expansion was Spain and France's ownership of the Mississippi
347860	350620	River region, or more specifically, New Orleans.
350620	355580	You see, New Orleans was perhaps the most important city on the continent because it
355580	359460	lay where the most important river on the continent met the ocean.
359460	365700	The Mississippi River has an absolutely enormous watershed that all drains here.
365700	369220	He who controlled New Orleans controlled the entire middle country.
369220	374280	There were almost no roads going from east to west in North America in the early 1800s
374280	378780	so to get something from Pittsburgh to New York, it was actually easier to ship by boat
378780	383820	on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the Atlantic than to make the 300 mile overland
383820	384820	trek.
384820	390280	This was how people got things around so without access to New Orleans, the US had no access
390280	394820	to the rivers and without access to the rivers, the US couldn't get crops and other goods
394820	397180	from this region to the outside world.
397180	401220	Luckily, France agreed to sell New Orleans and the rest of their huge swath of land to
401220	406700	the US in 1803 for the equivalent of $250 million, 2017 dollars.
406700	412360	This proved to be one of the best purchases in history as the area now has an estimated
412360	415680	value of $1.2 trillion.
415680	421880	The US then got access to the Pacific in 1819 in the Pacific Northwest then fully in 1848
421880	426120	at the end of the Mexican-American war upon the secession of California and the southwest
426120	427120	from Mexico.
427120	430680	The United States now existed from sea to shining sea.
430680	436920	It was at this moment when people were convinced, with merit, that the US was untouchable.
436920	441360	No real superpower existed in the western hemisphere which meant that nobody could truly
441360	443920	threaten the existence of the United States.
443920	448560	Any invading army would have to run supply chains across oceans which greatly reduces
448560	453480	power and, at least historically, there was no threat of another superpower arising on
453480	457840	the North American continent because of, once again, geography.
457840	462460	Mexico was largely a desert and had no solid river system like the US to facilitate ease
462460	463740	of movement.
463740	467840	Without a solid transport system and ability to easily grow crops, it had little chance
467840	472600	of gaining the population and level of development necessary to rival the US.
472600	475440	Canada also had its own transportation problems.
475440	479920	It didn't have any rivers crossing the country, its climate didn't allow for much farming,
479920	482720	and mountainous terrain made roads difficult.
482720	488920	Few realize that even today only one two-lane road connects the entirety of eastern Canada
488920	491640	to the entirety of western Canada.
491640	497320	Just last year a bridge on the Trans-Canada highway collapsed and so, for 17 hours, there
497320	502440	was no way to drive from east to west and the country was split in two.
502440	506800	If ever Canada was invaded by land, there would be no solid way to facilitate troop
506800	511320	movement and it would likely operate more as regions than a cohesive country.
511320	515960	The US is therefore in a privileged position today where thousands of miles separate it
515960	518140	from the serious issues of abroad.
518140	523060	The North American continent is largely devoid of international conflict and so the United
523060	527660	States' success can be accurately attributed to its geographic isolation.
527660	531620	When you don't have to worry about protecting against a potential invasion you can devote
531620	536020	more time to education, development, science, and politics.
536020	539160	The United States is a country that worked almost by chance.
539160	543700	It just happened that the right mix of people landed in the right place to create a world
543700	548860	superpower so, without the fantastic geography of the continent, the United States almost
548860	553780	certainly would not be the superpower it is today.
