00:09.480 --> 00:14.940
The United States and its entire history can be largely explained by its geography.

00:14.940 --> 00:20.220
Since its inception, the fundamental factor influencing and guiding the country's development

00:20.220 --> 00:22.780
is that it is far from everything else.

00:22.780 --> 00:26.960
The US is bounded to the east and west by ocean and to the north and south by friendly

00:26.960 --> 00:32.080
and militarily weak countries and this has meant that the US has almost never been threatened

00:32.080 --> 00:33.420
on the home front.

00:33.420 --> 00:38.280
Many suspect that this is why the US has such a defined government and political structure

00:38.280 --> 00:42.480
because it had the time to develop the system while it wasn't worrying about potential

00:42.480 --> 00:43.480
invasion.

00:43.480 --> 00:47.360
But geography had a much deeper role in the formation of the United States that started

00:47.360 --> 00:49.760
back before the states were even united.

00:49.760 --> 00:52.520
It all started back in the colonial era.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.760
The thirteen colonies were essentially split into three geographically distinct groups

00:56.760 --> 00:59.960
that can explain why the areas look the way they do today.

00:59.960 --> 01:04.400
The New England colonies were heavily forested and had some fantastic natural ports like

01:04.400 --> 01:05.880
Boston and Newport.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.760
However, the area had a short growing season and a rocky landscape which meant that the

01:09.760 --> 01:11.840
crops never grew very well.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.160
Therefore, the area ended up as a center for shipbuilding activity and fishing.

01:16.160 --> 01:20.960
To get their food, they would trade with the breadbasket of America—the middle colonies.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.960
This mid-Atlantic region was fantastic for farming.

01:23.960 --> 01:28.520
The area has a long, warm growing season and plentiful, arable soil.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.960
It also has navigable rivers stretching far inland that could help transport goods.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.700
Philadelphia and New York were the two major cities of the colonial era and their locations

01:38.700 --> 01:39.920
reflect their roles.

01:39.920 --> 01:45.360
You'll notice that both New York and Philadelphia are at the mouth of significant, navigable

01:45.360 --> 01:47.920
rivers while Boston is not.

01:47.920 --> 01:52.240
The inland mid-Atlantic farmers transported their goods via these rivers so the major

01:52.240 --> 01:55.880
cities grew as trading posts at the end of these rivers.

01:55.880 --> 02:00.080
If New England had been a farming based economy, its largest city would likely have developed

02:00.080 --> 02:04.500
here at the mouth of the Connecticut River but even though it was navigable, the river

02:04.500 --> 02:06.520
was of little use to the area.

02:06.520 --> 02:11.180
Having a major ocean going port in Boston was what was important for the maritime based

02:11.180 --> 02:12.680
New England economy.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.160
Further south were the southern colonies—home to some of the oldest colonial settlements.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.800
Now there's this one line that you can put on a map to explain why southern cities

02:21.800 --> 02:24.540
are where they are—it's called the fall line.

02:24.540 --> 02:28.280
The technical explanation is that this is where the soft sedimentary rock that forms

02:28.280 --> 02:32.720
the coastal plains meets the hard basement rock that forms the land farther inland.

02:32.720 --> 02:37.400
The simple explanation is, however, that above this line rivers will have waterfalls and

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
rapids.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.000
Below, they'll be flat and navigable.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.240
Baltimore, Richmond, Durham, Raleigh, Columbia, Augusta, and a bunch of smaller cities all

02:47.240 --> 02:50.660
sit almost exactly on the fall line.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.320
There are two reasons for this.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.280
The obvious one is that below these cities the rivers were navigable so colonists could

02:56.280 --> 03:00.320
get to these cities, but what was perhaps more important was that they were far inland

03:00.320 --> 03:01.880
which gave protection.

03:01.880 --> 03:06.880
Spain controlled Florida for much of colonial history and had a significant military presence.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.720
At the time it was reasonable to think that they would continue their expansion by moving

03:10.720 --> 03:16.280
up the coast so colonial cities in the south chose their locations in part based on natural

03:16.280 --> 03:17.280
fortifications.

03:17.280 --> 03:23.760
But some of the most significant events in US history happened because of one fact—the

03:23.760 --> 03:25.360
south is hot.

03:25.360 --> 03:29.020
Very early into colonial history settlers in the south figured out that the area was

03:29.020 --> 03:33.420
fantastic for tobacco cultivation and England loved tobacco.

03:33.420 --> 03:38.280
The only problem was, tobacco is a much more labor-intensive crop than wheat or beans or

03:38.280 --> 03:42.760
corn so the farmers brought in help… just not voluntarily.

03:42.760 --> 03:47.020
The American south became one of the biggest destinations of the slave trade and plantation

03:47.020 --> 03:48.880
owners were getting filthy rich.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.160
A big reason slavery existed for so long in the US was actually because the south was

03:54.160 --> 03:55.720
so physically big.

03:55.720 --> 03:59.820
You see, the job of Supreme Court Justice used to be part-time.

03:59.820 --> 04:04.560
In the 19th century the justices would only come to DC for a portion of the year and for

04:04.560 --> 04:09.120
the rest of the year they would travel around an assigned area and hear cases alongside

04:09.120 --> 04:10.300
local judges.

04:10.300 --> 04:15.460
The problem was, the north was much more densely populated and had better travel infrastructure

04:15.460 --> 04:16.460
than the south.

04:16.460 --> 04:21.680
The south was vast, sparsely populated, and had very rudimentary road systems.

04:21.680 --> 04:26.760
Therefore, judges assigned to the north were given a smaller area with a larger population

04:26.760 --> 04:31.040
while the southern judges were given a larger area with a smaller population so that they

04:31.040 --> 04:33.840
could get around their whole circuit in the same time.

04:33.840 --> 04:39.640
Therefore, in the 19th century when considering the constitutionality of slavery, the south,

04:39.640 --> 04:43.960
the slave-owning area, was over-represented in the Supreme Court.

04:43.960 --> 04:49.940
The crucial Dred Scott case in 1857 which cemented the legality of slavery in US territory

04:49.940 --> 04:56.040
was decided by a bench of five southern judges and four northern ones even though only 8

04:56.040 --> 05:00.760
million of the country's 27 million free inhabitants lived in southern states.

05:00.920 --> 05:05.360
Although some may call it a stretch, you can at least partially attribute the civil war

05:05.360 --> 05:10.000
to the weather in the south that made tobacco and cotton cultivation possible.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.100
So how did the US end up becoming the superpower it is today?

05:14.100 --> 05:18.880
After the colonial era, the United States had to push out west to gain the strategic

05:18.880 --> 05:20.680
advantage of isolation.

05:20.680 --> 05:26.320
In 1800, what is now the US was essentially divided into three sections ruled by three

05:26.320 --> 05:29.980
countries—the United States, France, and Spain.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.900
In the colonial era nobody really ventured west of the Appalachians.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.660
There was no real reason to and it was the unknown.

05:36.660 --> 05:42.220
In fact, it wasn't until 1789 that the first explorer crossed the continent to the Pacific

05:42.220 --> 05:43.300
over land.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.860
The first problem preventing expansion was Spain and France's ownership of the Mississippi

05:47.860 --> 05:50.620
River region, or more specifically, New Orleans.

05:50.620 --> 05:55.580
You see, New Orleans was perhaps the most important city on the continent because it

05:55.580 --> 05:59.460
lay where the most important river on the continent met the ocean.

05:59.460 --> 06:05.700
The Mississippi River has an absolutely enormous watershed that all drains here.

06:05.700 --> 06:09.220
He who controlled New Orleans controlled the entire middle country.

06:09.220 --> 06:14.280
There were almost no roads going from east to west in North America in the early 1800s

06:14.280 --> 06:18.780
so to get something from Pittsburgh to New York, it was actually easier to ship by boat

06:18.780 --> 06:23.820
on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the Atlantic than to make the 300 mile overland

06:23.820 --> 06:24.820
trek.

06:24.820 --> 06:30.280
This was how people got things around so without access to New Orleans, the US had no access

06:30.280 --> 06:34.820
to the rivers and without access to the rivers, the US couldn't get crops and other goods

06:34.820 --> 06:37.180
from this region to the outside world.

06:37.180 --> 06:41.220
Luckily, France agreed to sell New Orleans and the rest of their huge swath of land to

06:41.220 --> 06:46.700
the US in 1803 for the equivalent of $250 million, 2017 dollars.

06:46.700 --> 06:52.360
This proved to be one of the best purchases in history as the area now has an estimated

06:52.360 --> 06:55.680
value of $1.2 trillion.

06:55.680 --> 07:01.880
The US then got access to the Pacific in 1819 in the Pacific Northwest then fully in 1848

07:01.880 --> 07:06.120
at the end of the Mexican-American war upon the secession of California and the southwest

07:06.120 --> 07:07.120
from Mexico.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.680
The United States now existed from sea to shining sea.

07:10.680 --> 07:16.920
It was at this moment when people were convinced, with merit, that the US was untouchable.

07:16.920 --> 07:21.360
No real superpower existed in the western hemisphere which meant that nobody could truly

07:21.360 --> 07:23.920
threaten the existence of the United States.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.560
Any invading army would have to run supply chains across oceans which greatly reduces

07:28.560 --> 07:33.480
power and, at least historically, there was no threat of another superpower arising on

07:33.480 --> 07:37.840
the North American continent because of, once again, geography.

07:37.840 --> 07:42.460
Mexico was largely a desert and had no solid river system like the US to facilitate ease

07:42.460 --> 07:43.740
of movement.

07:43.740 --> 07:47.840
Without a solid transport system and ability to easily grow crops, it had little chance

07:47.840 --> 07:52.600
of gaining the population and level of development necessary to rival the US.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.440
Canada also had its own transportation problems.

07:55.440 --> 07:59.920
It didn't have any rivers crossing the country, its climate didn't allow for much farming,

07:59.920 --> 08:02.720
and mountainous terrain made roads difficult.

08:02.720 --> 08:08.920
Few realize that even today only one two-lane road connects the entirety of eastern Canada

08:08.920 --> 08:11.640
to the entirety of western Canada.

08:11.640 --> 08:17.320
Just last year a bridge on the Trans-Canada highway collapsed and so, for 17 hours, there

08:17.320 --> 08:22.440
was no way to drive from east to west and the country was split in two.

08:22.440 --> 08:26.800
If ever Canada was invaded by land, there would be no solid way to facilitate troop

08:26.800 --> 08:31.320
movement and it would likely operate more as regions than a cohesive country.

08:31.320 --> 08:35.960
The US is therefore in a privileged position today where thousands of miles separate it

08:35.960 --> 08:38.140
from the serious issues of abroad.

08:38.140 --> 08:43.060
The North American continent is largely devoid of international conflict and so the United

08:43.060 --> 08:47.660
States' success can be accurately attributed to its geographic isolation.

08:47.660 --> 08:51.620
When you don't have to worry about protecting against a potential invasion you can devote

08:51.620 --> 08:56.020
more time to education, development, science, and politics.

08:56.020 --> 08:59.160
The United States is a country that worked almost by chance.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.700
It just happened that the right mix of people landed in the right place to create a world

09:03.700 --> 09:08.860
superpower so, without the fantastic geography of the continent, the United States almost

09:08.860 --> 09:13.780
certainly would not be the superpower it is today.

09:13.780 --> 09:18.460
One of the most frequent questions I receive is what tools I use to run Wendover Productions.
