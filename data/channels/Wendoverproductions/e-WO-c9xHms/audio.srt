3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,940
The United States and its entire history can be largely explained by its geography.

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,220
Since its inception, the fundamental factor influencing and guiding the country's development

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,780
is that it is far from everything else.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,960
The US is bounded to the east and west by ocean and to the north and south by friendly

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,080
and militarily weak countries and this has meant that the US has almost never been threatened

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,420
on the home front.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,280
Many suspect that this is why the US has such a defined government and political structure

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,480
because it had the time to develop the system while it wasn't worrying about potential

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
invasion.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,360
But geography had a much deeper role in the formation of the United States that started

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
back before the states were even united.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,520
It all started back in the colonial era.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,760
The thirteen colonies were essentially split into three geographically distinct groups

16
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,960
that can explain why the areas look the way they do today.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,400
The New England colonies were heavily forested and had some fantastic natural ports like

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,880
Boston and Newport.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,760
However, the area had a short growing season and a rocky landscape which meant that the

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,840
crops never grew very well.

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,160
Therefore, the area ended up as a center for shipbuilding activity and fishing.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,960
To get their food, they would trade with the breadbasket of America—the middle colonies.

23
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,960
This mid-Atlantic region was fantastic for farming.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,520
The area has a long, warm growing season and plentiful, arable soil.

25
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,960
It also has navigable rivers stretching far inland that could help transport goods.

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,700
Philadelphia and New York were the two major cities of the colonial era and their locations

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,920
reflect their roles.

28
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,360
You'll notice that both New York and Philadelphia are at the mouth of significant, navigable

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
rivers while Boston is not.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,240
The inland mid-Atlantic farmers transported their goods via these rivers so the major

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,880
cities grew as trading posts at the end of these rivers.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,080
If New England had been a farming based economy, its largest city would likely have developed

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,500
here at the mouth of the Connecticut River but even though it was navigable, the river

34
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,520
was of little use to the area.

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,180
Having a major ocean going port in Boston was what was important for the maritime based

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,680
New England economy.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,160
Further south were the southern colonies—home to some of the oldest colonial settlements.

38
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,800
Now there's this one line that you can put on a map to explain why southern cities

39
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,540
are where they are—it's called the fall line.

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,280
The technical explanation is that this is where the soft sedimentary rock that forms

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,720
the coastal plains meets the hard basement rock that forms the land farther inland.

42
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,400
The simple explanation is, however, that above this line rivers will have waterfalls and

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
rapids.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,000
Below, they'll be flat and navigable.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,240
Baltimore, Richmond, Durham, Raleigh, Columbia, Augusta, and a bunch of smaller cities all

46
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,660
sit almost exactly on the fall line.

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,320
There are two reasons for this.

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,280
The obvious one is that below these cities the rivers were navigable so colonists could

49
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,320
get to these cities, but what was perhaps more important was that they were far inland

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,880
which gave protection.

51
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,880
Spain controlled Florida for much of colonial history and had a significant military presence.

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,720
At the time it was reasonable to think that they would continue their expansion by moving

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,280
up the coast so colonial cities in the south chose their locations in part based on natural

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
fortifications.

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,760
But some of the most significant events in US history happened because of one fact—the

56
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
south is hot.

57
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,020
Very early into colonial history settlers in the south figured out that the area was

58
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,420
fantastic for tobacco cultivation and England loved tobacco.

59
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,280
The only problem was, tobacco is a much more labor-intensive crop than wheat or beans or

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,760
corn so the farmers brought in help… just not voluntarily.

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,020
The American south became one of the biggest destinations of the slave trade and plantation

62
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,880
owners were getting filthy rich.

63
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,160
A big reason slavery existed for so long in the US was actually because the south was

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,720
so physically big.

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,820
You see, the job of Supreme Court Justice used to be part-time.

66
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,560
In the 19th century the justices would only come to DC for a portion of the year and for

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,120
the rest of the year they would travel around an assigned area and hear cases alongside

68
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,300
local judges.

69
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,460
The problem was, the north was much more densely populated and had better travel infrastructure

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,460
than the south.

71
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,680
The south was vast, sparsely populated, and had very rudimentary road systems.

72
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,760
Therefore, judges assigned to the north were given a smaller area with a larger population

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,040
while the southern judges were given a larger area with a smaller population so that they

74
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
could get around their whole circuit in the same time.

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Therefore, in the 19th century when considering the constitutionality of slavery, the south,

76
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,960
the slave-owning area, was over-represented in the Supreme Court.

77
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,940
The crucial Dred Scott case in 1857 which cemented the legality of slavery in US territory

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,040
was decided by a bench of five southern judges and four northern ones even though only 8

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,760
million of the country's 27 million free inhabitants lived in southern states.

80
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,360
Although some may call it a stretch, you can at least partially attribute the civil war

81
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
to the weather in the south that made tobacco and cotton cultivation possible.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,100
So how did the US end up becoming the superpower it is today?

83
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,880
After the colonial era, the United States had to push out west to gain the strategic

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
advantage of isolation.

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,320
In 1800, what is now the US was essentially divided into three sections ruled by three

86
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,980
countries—the United States, France, and Spain.

87
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,900
In the colonial era nobody really ventured west of the Appalachians.

88
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,660
There was no real reason to and it was the unknown.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,220
In fact, it wasn't until 1789 that the first explorer crossed the continent to the Pacific

90
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,300
over land.

91
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,860
The first problem preventing expansion was Spain and France's ownership of the Mississippi

92
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,620
River region, or more specifically, New Orleans.

93
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,580
You see, New Orleans was perhaps the most important city on the continent because it

94
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,460
lay where the most important river on the continent met the ocean.

95
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,700
The Mississippi River has an absolutely enormous watershed that all drains here.

96
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,220
He who controlled New Orleans controlled the entire middle country.

97
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,280
There were almost no roads going from east to west in North America in the early 1800s

98
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,780
so to get something from Pittsburgh to New York, it was actually easier to ship by boat

99
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,820
on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the Atlantic than to make the 300 mile overland

100
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,820
trek.

101
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,280
This was how people got things around so without access to New Orleans, the US had no access

102
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,820
to the rivers and without access to the rivers, the US couldn't get crops and other goods

103
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,180
from this region to the outside world.

104
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,220
Luckily, France agreed to sell New Orleans and the rest of their huge swath of land to

105
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,700
the US in 1803 for the equivalent of $250 million, 2017 dollars.

106
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,360
This proved to be one of the best purchases in history as the area now has an estimated

107
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,680
value of $1.2 trillion.

108
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,880
The US then got access to the Pacific in 1819 in the Pacific Northwest then fully in 1848

109
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,120
at the end of the Mexican-American war upon the secession of California and the southwest

110
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
from Mexico.

111
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,680
The United States now existed from sea to shining sea.

112
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,920
It was at this moment when people were convinced, with merit, that the US was untouchable.

113
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,360
No real superpower existed in the western hemisphere which meant that nobody could truly

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,920
threaten the existence of the United States.

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,560
Any invading army would have to run supply chains across oceans which greatly reduces

116
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,480
power and, at least historically, there was no threat of another superpower arising on

117
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,840
the North American continent because of, once again, geography.

118
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,460
Mexico was largely a desert and had no solid river system like the US to facilitate ease

119
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,740
of movement.

120
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,840
Without a solid transport system and ability to easily grow crops, it had little chance

121
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,600
of gaining the population and level of development necessary to rival the US.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,440
Canada also had its own transportation problems.

123
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,920
It didn't have any rivers crossing the country, its climate didn't allow for much farming,

124
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,720
and mountainous terrain made roads difficult.

125
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,920
Few realize that even today only one two-lane road connects the entirety of eastern Canada

126
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,640
to the entirety of western Canada.

127
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,320
Just last year a bridge on the Trans-Canada highway collapsed and so, for 17 hours, there

128
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:22,440
was no way to drive from east to west and the country was split in two.

129
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,800
If ever Canada was invaded by land, there would be no solid way to facilitate troop

130
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,320
movement and it would likely operate more as regions than a cohesive country.

131
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,960
The US is therefore in a privileged position today where thousands of miles separate it

132
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,140
from the serious issues of abroad.

133
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,060
The North American continent is largely devoid of international conflict and so the United

134
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:47,660
States' success can be accurately attributed to its geographic isolation.

135
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,620
When you don't have to worry about protecting against a potential invasion you can devote

136
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,020
more time to education, development, science, and politics.

137
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,160
The United States is a country that worked almost by chance.

138
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,700
It just happened that the right mix of people landed in the right place to create a world

139
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,860
superpower so, without the fantastic geography of the continent, the United States almost

140
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,780
certainly would not be the superpower it is today.

141
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,460
One of the most frequent questions I receive is what tools I use to run Wendover Productions.

142
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,720
As you've heard many times before, one of them is Squarespace.

143
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,080
When running a business like Wendover Productions, it's hugely important to have a professional

144
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,240
web presence.

145
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,700
When you search Wendover Productions on Google, the third result that comes up is my Squarespace

146
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,860
website and there's a good chance that the website is the first page someone will look

147
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,620
at when trying to learn about Wendover Productions so it's hugely important that it looks good

148
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,260
and runs well.

149
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,020
