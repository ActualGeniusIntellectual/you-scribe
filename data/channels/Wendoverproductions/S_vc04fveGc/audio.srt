1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
More than eight years have passed since I uploaded the very first video to this channel,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,780
and the world was a very different place back in 2015.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,280
Brexit and a Trump presidency both felt like longshots, the term Coronavirus was only known

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,000
by epidemiologists and crossword aficionados, same-sex marriage had just been legalized

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,200
nationwide in the US, Netflix and other streamers were only just starting to threaten cable

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,800
supremacy, TikTok's Chinese predecessor didn't even exist yet.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,880
The eight years since the start of this channel have been extremely consequential in ways

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,100
we almost certainly don't yet fully understand.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,240
Often the way we think about a Wendover video is not as the news of the day or week or month,

10
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,600
but rather the news of the year.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,360
We try to cover some of the most consequential changes going on in the world that might be

12
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,940
easy to miss due to how gradually they're unfolding, but with enough time, even the

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,720
news of the year changes.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,740
So today, as our last video of this year, we're going to be revisiting nine of our

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,240
most popular videos to look at what's different and what isn't, starting with a rare yet

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,080
encouraging case where we call out a problem, and then that problem actually starts to get

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,000
fixed.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,360
Three years ago, we released a video called The Electric Vehicle Charging Problem.

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,660
It argued that perhaps the biggest barrier to greater EV adoption was the charging infrastructure,

20
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,680
rather than the cost of the vehicles themselves, meaning governments would find that incentivizing

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,240
cheaper construction would be a better use of their money than offsetting the purchase

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,560
price of cars, as was the incentive norm at the time.

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,360
Shortly after, quite a lot changed—for the better.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,980
In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, including $5 billion for the construction

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:38,280
of 500,000 fast chargers by 2027.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,720
An additional $2.5 billion was allocated to the brand new Charging and Fueling Infrastructure

27
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,020
Discretionary Grant program, which will give money directly to cities, tribes, and local

28
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,300
governments over the next five years to build even more chargers, essentially solving the

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,460
EV charging problem by addressing it from the top down and bottom up.

30
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,980
Already, America's chargers have nearly doubled in number since 2019.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,280
But just because a station has been built doesn't mean it's working.

32
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,480
A consistent sticking point with the country's existing infrastructure has been its unreliability.

33
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Charging a battery with hundreds of kilowatts of energy is vastly more complicated than

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,540
filling up a gas tank, as consistent, reliable charging requires a large DC power source,

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,980
functioning connectors and receptors, credit card readers, and touch screens, unlike gas

36
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,060
stations, which only require working pumps and credit card readers to dispense fuel that's

37
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,260
then ignited.

38
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,940
The problem is, the largest charging networks for non-Tesla electric vehicles are run by

39
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,100
EVGo and Electrify America, which were both born begrudgingly—EVGo for NRG Energy to

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,200
gain regulatory compliance, and Electrify America as part of Volkswagen's Emissions

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Gate settlement.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,460
Therefore, they've not always been the most customer-friendly, and each has been criticized

43
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,060
for a high number of non-working chargers, which can strand drivers due to limited alternatives,

44
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,600
but to help solve the issue, the Biden administration allocated an additional $100 million this

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,300
year for EV infrastructure repairs.

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,740
And there's good news for consumers who have issues with Combined Charging System,

47
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,300
or CCS plugins.

48
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,840
CCS has emerged as the dominant non-Tesla charging port standard in the US, but that

49
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,460
means there are two redundant yet still sparse systems of chargers—one for Tesla drivers

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,780
and one for everyone else.

51
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,500
But following a flurry of announcements, from 2025 on, nearly all North American EV

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,300
manufacturers will adopt the Tesla, now known as the North American Charging Standard, which

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,220
they argue is better for consumers.

54
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:34,120
Millions will be able to access Tesla's nationwide charging network before the Inflation

55
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,340
Reduction Act's chargers are complete.

56
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,660
The Tesla charging port is objectively more user-friendly than the CCS port—it's less

57
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,260
than half the size, plugs in easier, and can alternate between supplying AC and DC energy.

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:51,100
Plus, Tesla must open its charging network to non-Tesla EVs to qualify for funding from

59
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,420
the Inflation Reduction Act, which means consumers with pre-existing CCS ports can tap in to

60
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,420
an increasing number of Tesla chargers with retrofitted dual ports already.

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,140
On the other side of the globe, nearly two years after we released our video titled The

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,540
Failed Logistics of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainians are still in the midst

63
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,060
of a war with Russia.

64
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,840
In the invasion's opening weeks, we covered how logistics failures were a major cause

65
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,560
of Russia's unexpected failure to capture Kiev, and having identified this weakness,

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,240
Ukraine went on to strategically target Russian logistics infrastructure as the war continued.

67
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,940
As the saying goes, amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, when it comes

68
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,220
to warfare.

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,400
This is helping Ukraine maintain their ground against the comparatively massive Russian

70
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
military.

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,440
Ukraine's primary strategy has involved splitting its troops and tanks equally between

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,920
its eastern and southern borders to find and exploit cracks in Russia's defenses.

73
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Since March 2022, Ukrainian forces have reclaimed half of the territory taken by Russia, from

74
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,040
here to here.

75
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,360
In fact, Russian forces were forced to pivot their strategy after the opening days of the

76
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
war, and later abandoned its northern front here, as their logistical hurdles there had

77
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,880
become too difficult to overcome.

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,560
Because Russia can't get frontline supplies far into Ukraine, they've had to rely on

79
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,780
civilian vehicles to transport goods and switch from long-range missiles to unguided munitions,

80
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,620
as they ran low on precision missiles after failing to overtake Ukraine's forces in

81
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,360
the opening days of the war.

82
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,440
Where Russia still holds land in eastern Ukraine, they've erected miles of blockades that

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,420
essentially require brute force, rather than guerrilla warfare, to reclaim.

84
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,140
They planted tens of thousands of mines and built miles of concrete barriers, which along

85
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,180
with strategic vehicle traps, stalled Ukraine's counteroffensive for months.

86
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,540
Russia's been able to hold out so long because of its ability to acquire weapons and vehicles

87
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,300
for the front lines, in spite of its needs-averse pull military strategy.

88
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,420
Russia still has the upper hand for artillery, as they fired an estimated 10 to 11 million

89
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,260
rounds last year with their manufacturing and transportation capacities, which means

90
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,780
Ukraine is still dependent on Western countries for supplies.

91
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,140
Ukraine's logistics could also be threatened by its other enemy—corruption.

92
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,100
President Zelensky has continually replaced cabinet officials and military officers, as

93
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,420
well as the nation's defense minister, to stave off an endemic problem until the war

94
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,420
ends.

95
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,020
Here on St Helena, things have changed as much as they can on a remote Atlantic island

96
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,200
since we released our documentary, The World's Most Useful Airport, in 2019.

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,220
It covered how runway design issues meant St Helena could never get the flights it truly

98
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,060
wanted—a direct connection to London, its capital.

99
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,920
This would have both allowed for easier trips to locals to visit family, and easier trips

100
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,100
for the likeliest inbound tourist market.

101
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,780
Well, St Helena finally got London flights—just not exactly in the form it wanted.

102
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,500
You see, as COVID shut down borders globally, it became impractical and financially infeasible

103
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,740
for the commercial airline, Aerling, to continue to fly flights from its hub in Johannesburg,

104
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,180
leaving the island without air service—but St Helena still needed air service to keep

105
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,020
supplies and people going in and out.

106
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,140
Therefore, non-stop flights began from London—albeit only every three weeks, paid for by the government,

107
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,980
and only with the select few passengers cleared to come to the island.

108
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,040
You see, thanks to its isolation and severe border restrictions, in 2021, St Helena was

109
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,200
one of just three jurisdictions globally to have avoided even a single COVID case.

110
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,020
After all, individuals could only enter after a 14-day quarantine, negative PCR test, and

111
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,300
constant masking.

112
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,660
St Helena's extreme isolation worked to its advantage during a global pandemic, as

113
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,220
it kept its 4,500 islanders safe, yet it got in the way of its mission to grow a self-sustaining

114
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,100
tourism economy, as its two hotels shuttered for over a year.

115
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,500
In September 2022, though, St Helena dropped its vaccination, masking, and quarantine policies,

116
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,820
and as a promising sign of rebound, recently announced that a second weekly flight will

117
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,020
resume flying from Johannesburg to St Helena every Tuesday.

118
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,300
And as tourism works to rebound, St Helena hit another major milestone that could transform

119
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:51,980
its economy and relationship with the outside world—it was finally connected to fiber-optic

120
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,200
internet.

121
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,360
Since 1989, the island has relied on a single satellite dish to carry all internet transmissions.

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,460
Because St Helena is so small, it's held out with this slow, sometimes sporadic satellite

123
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,280
dish for quite a long time, which has made islanders beholden to a telecom monopoly,

124
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
Shur.

125
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,500
As Shur was the only internet and TV provider, they set higher than average prices, even

126
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,680
charging islanders 600% premiums for any additional data usage incurred, despite the inherent

127
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,720
limitations of internet speeds routed through a single dish.

128
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,920
Therefore, while islanders had practical access to email and web browsing, it was perhaps

129
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:31,200
one of the last places on earth where innovations like web streaming and calls were an impractical

130
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,200
luxury.

131
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,380
But, in 2018, the European Union granted the island 21.5 million euros as part of its European

132
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:43,120
Development Fund to construct and maintain an undersea fiber-optic cable capable of transmitting

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,400
80 terabits per second.

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,040
Essentially, St Helena paid Google to construct a branch of the tech giant's Aquano cable,

135
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,960
which goes from here to here along the coast of Africa.

136
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,540
To offset the costs, the island plans to develop a satellite ground station business, working

137
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,440
with companies like Starlink to use their unique geographic position to link satellites

138
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
passing over the area of the Atlantic to the wider internet through the cable.

139
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,640
It's a project that will change the island physically, economically, and culturally.

140
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,480
St Helena will have the necessary infrastructure to support a strong, consistent internet connection,

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,280
with its extra data transmissions generating extra revenue.

142
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,560
It's a viable project model that other remote islands, like Tristan da Cunha, could also

143
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,840
replicate, with the cable now up and running and in beta testing.

144
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,800
So, as decisive as this decade will be for St Helena, it's already proven to be unparalleled.

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,040
While interconnectedness is now ushering in a new, more prosperous era in St Helena's

146
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,840
story, the pandemic, meanwhile, exposed the vulnerabilities of globalization.

147
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,220
We all remember the supply chain crisis—it crippled the industrial sector globally and

148
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:49,460
left consumers without products, as well as a lot of ships, out at sea.

149
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,640
Increased demand, bottlenecked ports, price increases, and more set this off, and then

150
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,740
each was magnified by the COVID-induced labor shortage.

151
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,980
But, when we first talked about this in our video, Why There Are So Many Shortages, we

152
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,580
called out the real Achilles heel of the sector—just-in-time manufacturing.

153
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,940
Businesses operated using the traditional just-in-case manufacturing model until the

154
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,260
1980s, building up inventories at each step in the process to assure the next phase wouldn't

155
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,060
be disrupted, even though they might exceed demand.

156
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,820
Eventually, though, manufacturers realized that all this surplus inventory was costing

157
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,540
them, reducing profit.

158
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,180
To disrupt that, a new model, introduced and developed by Toyota, shifted the process to

159
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,580
just-in-time.

160
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,780
Among other benefits, it freed up storage space and cash, and it worked… until it

161
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
didn't.

162
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,780
When labor shortages struck and cross-specific container movements slowed down, it caused

163
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,840
shipping delays and manufacturers weren't getting their parts just-in-time.

164
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,320
The crisis exposed a weakness in the just-in-time supply chain, so now, two years on, companies

165
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,600
are adapting.

166
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,620
Even though its causes and repercussions are weakening, the possibility of future disruptions

167
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,660
from events such as war or climate change are risks that businesses are increasingly

168
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,200
realizing they're not willing to take.

169
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,920
Instead of reverting back to one specific model, they're pulling pieces from several

170
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,920
and customizing their supply chains to work for them.

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,400
Take Volkswagen, for example.

172
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,160
When the disruptions of 2022 hit, the company saw a 7% decline in vehicles delivered, partially

173
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,400
due to the global semiconductor shortage.

174
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,760
Today, the company has not only diversified its semiconductor sourcing, expanding beyond

175
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,120
South Korean manufacturers and partnering with both European supplier STMicroelectronics

176
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,720
and Taiwan's TSMC, but has also set up an in-house cross-reference system to identify

177
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,420
shortages before they happen and find alternatives to silicon semiconductor chips.

178
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,840
This safety net is even more critical with the increasing market share of semiconductor-heavy

179
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,160
electric vehicles.

180
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,280
But building supply chain resiliency goes beyond just diversifying and sourcing alternatives.

181
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,820
Companies are also bringing operations geographically closer to home, called nearshoring, so they're

182
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,880
less exposed to global forces.

183
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,240
This is seen in the major migration of what was once Chinese manufacturing to Mexico,

184
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,700
as we covered in another video this year, which makes for shorter delivery times to

185
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,220
the US and Canada, easier quality control, and better supply chain resiliency due to

186
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,480
the LAN connection.

187
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,460
To continue playing the supply chain game, companies are also buffering or double-sourcing

188
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,340
where they can by identifying critical pieces, say a semiconductor chip in the supply chain,

189
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,180
and they're short-gaming the system by stockpiling just that specific part.

190
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,820
And of course, if AI wasn't part of the solution, then it wouldn't be 2023.

191
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,300
Companies are using smart technology to stop woes before they start.

192
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,180
AI can analyze output models and predict where a bottleneck or disruption may occur,

193
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,140
and it can also keep a running inventory and automatically reorder parts when they run

194
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,820
low.

195
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,100
Back in 2017, when we talked about the Little Plane War, it was following an intense corporate

196
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:43,460
volley between Bombardier and Embraer, two medium-sized companies manufacturing mid-haul

197
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,300
planes, and subsequently two very large companies, Boeing and Airbus, who wanted a piece of that

198
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,300
market.

199
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,140
The problem was that neither Bombardier nor Embraer had an in with the American commercial

200
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,500
aircraft market, the most lucrative in the world, and neither Boeing nor Airbus was making

201
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:01,780
a plane to meet the demand for smaller aircraft to service America's smaller airports.

202
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,580
To get ahead in the US, Bombardier undersold or dumped dozens of its C-series planes to

203
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,960
Delta, and Boeing didn't like that move.

204
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,900
In response, the American company filed a petition with the US Department of Commerce,

205
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,900
and it worked.

206
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:19,800
With Bombardier facing a 300% import tariff, it instead sold 50.1% of its shares to Airbus,

207
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,240
a European plane manufacturer with enormous purchasing and marketing power.

208
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,960
Also part of Airbus's appeal was the fact that it had a final assembly plant in Mobile,

209
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,260
Alabama, which meant its planes were technically American-made, at least partially, and that

210
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,160
waived foreign import fees.

211
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,400
Airbus quickly rebranded the C-series as the A220 to compete with Boeing 737, and the first

212
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,480
A220 made in Alabama took to the skies in June 2020.

213
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,280
Back then, some independent analysts predicted that the C-series would capture as much as

214
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,360
60% of the mid-haul market segment, with a goal to meet a demand of 3,000 planes over

215
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,640
the next 20 years, or about 12 and a half planes a month.

216
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,080
By 2022, Bombardier sold off its remaining interest to Airbus to focus exclusively on

217
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,880
its business aviation market.

218
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,080
In retrospect, this was clearly prudent, as it helped spur a 180-degree turnaround

219
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:10,520
from near-bankruptcy just years prior to $7.6 billion in profit in 2022.

220
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,160
Today, the A220 program is jointly owned by Airbus, its parent company, and the Canadian

221
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,980
province of Quebec, with a 25% share.

222
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:24,040
The two entities agreed to further invest in the A220 to a tune of $1.2 billion in 2022,

223
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:27,840
mostly in an effort to accelerate its total production to 14 per month between its plant

224
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,880
in Mobile and its headquarters in Mirabelle, Quebec.

225
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,320
That, however, has been slow.

226
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:39,040
In 2022, Airbus averaged just 4.5 A220 aircraft deliveries per month, thanks in part to supply

227
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,120
chain issues.

228
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,960
By late 2023, the company had manufactured a total of nearly 100 A220s.

229
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,880
Boeing, on the other hand, is playing catch-up.

230
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,760
It lacks a direct competitor aircraft to the A220, meaning it effectively seeded this smallest

231
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,240
sector of the aircraft market, so Airbus is clunkily hanging on to the market majority

232
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,600
and the plane war goes on.

233
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,400
Back in 2019, we released the video, How Rwanda is Becoming the Singapore of Africa, which

234
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,280
detailed President Pakigame's ascendancy and, at that point, 19-year reign in leading

235
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,280
the sub-Saharan country into prosperity—a transformation he hoped could be likened to

236
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,440
Singapore, one of the biggest success stories from Asia's era of rapid development.

237
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,400
Singapore excelled in three areas—geographic centrality, political stability, and ease

238
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:28,140
of doing business—and we noted where Rwanda was also meeting or improving on those.

239
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,260
At the time, indicators in Rwanda were promising—political stability was near the 50th percentile compared

240
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,920
to the rest of the globe, and the control of corruption near the 70th percentile, while

241
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,380
the country's GDP was quickly rising.

242
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,140
Since then, the pandemic, of course, stalled progress, but though the economy has been

243
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,360
quicker to recover, some indicators are now plateauing or even starting to fall.

244
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,500
Four years ago, it was notable that Kagame was still in power and had no plans for succession—this

245
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,660
raised eyebrows—and today, well, he's still at the helm.

246
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,120
While undeniably effective, bringing Rwanda from a genocidal crisis to a regional leader

247
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,100
in stability and development, questions on whether Kagame's means justify his ends

248
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,460
are becoming easier to answer.

249
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,240
In 2021, the US State Department released a report detailing several human rights violations,

250
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,820
which included, quote, unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government and forced disappearance

251
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,260
by the government.

252
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,700
Among those is poet and social critic Innocent Baty, who remains missing.

253
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,460
Then, there's the case of Paul Rusesabagina, who's known for his role in saving thousands

254
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,060
of lives during the genocide, as depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda,

255
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,780
but more recently for having been kidnapped by the Rwandan government.

256
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,300
Rusesabagina was a vocal critic of the Kagame administration before he boarded a private

257
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,660
flight from Dubai to Burundi for a speaking engagement, or so he thought.

258
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,920
Instead, he was sedated and flown against his will to Kigali, where he was detained

259
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,020
and held in solitary confinement before the government found him guilty on terrorism-related

260
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,980
charges and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.

261
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,060
Eventually, as of early 2023, he is now out on commutation following international political

262
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,340
pressure, yet this demonstrates the direction the country, and especially its leader, is

263
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,340
heading.

264
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,940
While it's long been understood that civil rights and freedoms are limited in Rwanda,

265
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,100
proponents of Kagame's argue that they were necessary to take the country from its genocide

266
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,300
to its current era of relative prosperity.

267
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:24,540
But perhaps because those rights violations are becoming more egregious, that era of prosperity

268
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:27,260
is looking like it could be coming to an end.

269
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:31,500
The murder rate has increased to four per 100,000, the average life expectancy has dropped

270
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,780
a year, and both the corruption and political stability percentiles have decreased at least

271
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,380
one percentage point.

272
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,560
But things are looking more promising from an economic perspective—businesses are continuing

273
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,260
to invest in Rwanda.

274
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:48,180
Most notably, Rwandair entered a partnership with Qatar Airways, which purchased a 49%

275
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,300
minority stake in the state-owned national airline.

276
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,340
Together they've invested in the new Begasara International Airport, a $1.3 billion project

277
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,860
that's under construction and set to handle 7 million passengers and 150 million tons

278
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,820
of cargo each year and act as a regional hub for sub-Saharan Africa.

279
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,540
It's slated for completion in 2026, and to meet that growth, Rwandair is doubling

280
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,600
its fleet from 13 to 26 planes.

281
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:17,700
Other businesses are taking note—Volkswagen, Motorola Solutions, Andela, and Radisson have

282
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,420
planted flags in Rwanda.

283
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,100
The country continues to shift and craft policy to entice foreign direct investment, and a

284
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,540
2023 US State Department report says that it's quote, easy to launch a business in

285
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,740
Rwanda, but making it profitable can be a challenge.

286
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:38,920
And yet, the GDP continues to climb, growing 8.2% in 2022, hitting $13.31 billion.

287
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,500
In the fall, Kagame announced he would run for re-election again in 2024, which is only

288
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,000
possible because his government extended term limits in 2015, and so the fate of the country

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,420
appears to remain in his hands.

290
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,660
And just as we said four years ago, it'll be up to him and his administration to improve

291
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,980
upon the political climate in order to make foreign direct investment attractive and stable.

292
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,860
It's not yet Singapore, but it's still trying.

293
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,580
Then there's China.

294
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,260
Now, if you're an aspiring educational YouTuber, here's a tip—make videos about China.

295
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,440
It's an interesting, dynamic place that just does numbers.

296
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,340
A lot happens there, and a lot has changed since we started making videos dealing with

297
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
the country.

298
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,980
Take, for instance, this one.

299
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,060
It's five years old, it did 9 million views, and while its main points still hold true,

300
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,740
how exactly China is making Africa its own China has shifted.

301
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,680
Now, the video's claim was that much of the continent is economically and politically

302
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,860
aligned with China, simply because China has pumped huge amounts of money into the continent

303
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,980
of Africa.

304
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,760
This much is still true today—China is still Africa's biggest financial supporter, only

305
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,220
pumping more and more foreign direct aid into the continent.

306
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,760
And as to why they're investing, well, that hasn't changed either—it's because of

307
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,860
what comes back in the form of cheaper labor, resources, and goods.

308
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,380
And the form of Chinese investment?

309
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,780
That's pretty much the same too, as most investment comes through large to very large

310
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,060
infrastructure projects.

311
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:03,500
What's changed has to do with, well, time.

312
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,540
Like every big project, the beginning's usually marked with excitement, but success

313
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,680
ultimately comes down to execution further down the road.

314
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,460
Take this light rail system that the original video identified as an impressive example

315
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,400
of Chinese investment in Ethiopia as it established sub-Saharan Africa's first inner-city tram

316
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,400
in 2015.

317
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,760
Well, now this system's proving difficult to keep running on time while operating costs

318
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,400
continue to crawl higher and higher.

319
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,300
Already by 2018, outside observers had identified that the system had a fundamental electricity

320
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,540
supply issue, which has only gotten worse since.

321
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:41,840
As of 2020, the system that once ran 41 trains across two lines was now only running 17.

322
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,920
As of 2023, average traffic had dropped to about 50% of the high-water mark, while waits

323
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,360
along the green line had ballooned to 19 minutes.

324
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,040
The problem is, it's hard for Ethiopian officials to keep the system running when

325
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:57,980
it can't get spare parts easily and lack the institutional knowledge required to fix

326
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,360
the Chinese-manufactured trainset.

327
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,800
This transit system is a microcosm for how Chinese investment in Africa has played out

328
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
more broadly.

329
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,920
They break ground on exciting projects that promise to aid African development, but the

330
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,480
projects prove ultimately flawed by a lack of foresight and an over-serving of blind

331
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
optimism.

332
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,440
For African countries with newfound experience in the difficulty of the upkeep and follow-through

333
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,440
on these infrastructure projects, some leaders are becoming more cautious of welcoming them

334
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,040
in while, for its part, China, now more wary of the cost of large-scale infrastructure

335
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,220
investment, is beginning to slow its role too, leading to serious belt-tightening on

336
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,080
these projects that have come to comprise the Belt and Road Initiative.

337
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,900
And it's not just the money leaving China that's changing, either.

338
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,920
The nation's robust manufacturing sector that has spearheaded its massive export economy

339
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,760
for decades has started to take a different shape in the last few years.

340
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,800
Chinese manufacturing still wins, but it's winning less, now six years later.

341
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,660
So too has this channel, as six years ago I actually traveled to make this, making my

342
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,640
way to the capital of Chinese technology manufacturing, Shenzhen, in the Guangdong province, so I

343
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,600
went there to see what it was like.

344
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,200
This was the first time I ever traveled for a video, thanks to an invitation by the company

345
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Anchor.

346
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,040
Back then, they were a burgeoning startup that was just celebrating making their way

347
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,080
into Walmart, but today they've grown into a Chinese entrepreneurship success story,

348
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,700
and a company there's a good shot you've heard of.

349
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,560
Shenzhen as a city is really known for two things, one is its manufacturing capabilities,

350
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:31,500
especially for consumer electronics products, and second is gravitation for talents or human

351
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,680
resources, especially on the product development and research and development disciplines.

352
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,520
Six years on, this is still the case.

353
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,560
Shenzhen is the hardware capital of the world, and still home to some of the biggest tech

354
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,640
manufacturers, but not quite to the level it once was.

355
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,000
Take this motion graphic—Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, Canon—they all manufacture

356
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,680
products here in Shenzhen.

357
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Or they did.

358
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,000
In 2018, Samsung closed its factory in Shenzhen.

359
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,160
More recently, Canon has closed its Zhuhai plant.

360
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,320
As for Microsoft, Sony, and Apple, they remain in the city, but the latter two have minimized

361
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,000
their presence within the country, with Sony moving all its camera-making facilities to

362
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,120
different countries.

363
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,280
Shenzhen is still the dominant power in the tech world, but it's giving up ground, and

364
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,340
that much can be said of Chinese manufacturing overall.

365
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,440
This is manufacturing output from China from 2004 to 2022—it's doing broadly what it

366
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,260
should be doing, going up and to the right with a stagnation during the COVID years.

367
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,760
The thing is, it's shrinking as a percentage of China's GDP—where it sat in the low

368
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,220
30s during the early 2010s, it's now in the mid-to-high 20s in the early 2020s.

369
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,100
This is all because the Chinese economy is changing.

370
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,860
As it makes strides towards middle-income status, China's economy is trending towards

371
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,140
services rather than manufacturing, and as standards of living and wages increase, the

372
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,460
benefits of manufacturing in China are becoming less obvious.

373
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,820
This, along with added geopolitical tensions, has turned some countries towards so-called

374
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,560
China-plus-one strategies, where they maintain a factory foothold in the country, but also

375
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,240
diversify their supply chain with factories in, say, Vietnam, so should a COVID strand

376
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,440
or a spat in the South China Sea turn off supply from Shenzhen, the company can stay

377
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
afloat.

378
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,160
Or, companies are beginning to outright skip on China's relatively cheap labor for options

379
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,120
close to home, which has to do with lessons learned with COVID shortages mentioned earlier,

380
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,300
as well as the exciting potential of other manufacturing bases, as, once again, we mentioned

381
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,540
in this year's video.

382
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,460
In this case of Mexico, both American and Chinese companies hoping to be nearer to the

383
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,000
US, while still benefiting from less expensive labor, have moved operations to just south

384
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,420
of the American border.

385
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,420
As it factors within China, and outside of China, the nation's manufacturing might

386
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:45,020
has shown cracks in the last few years, but still, for now, it wins—just by a narrower

387
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,420
margin than before.

388
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,080
Now, if there's a theme throughout these China videos revisited, it's that, broadly,

389
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,780
the way the world interacts with the country has shifted throughout the early years of

390
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
this decade.

391
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,500
COVID-19, of course, is a major part of this story, but it's not all of it.

392
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,860
Take this video, Australia's China Problem.

393
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,900
Between it, we make the point that Australia has hitched its wagon to China economically,

394
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:11,260
putting it in a difficult spot where it doesn't align socially, culturally, or in some cases

395
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,040
morally, with the regional power.

396
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,980
To illustrate the economic tethering between the two nations, we highlighted higher education

397
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,020
and raw minerals as two sectors where Australia's come to lean on China.

398
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,220
Well, now Australia has begun to work towards addressing its dangerous reliance on trade

399
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,460
with China, and it's doing so within those sectors.

400
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,020
This is a graph of Chinese students enrolled in Australian higher education.

401
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,380
Now, obviously, the initial decline can be attributed to COVID-19, but in the last two

402
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,540
years the numbers have remained lower even as restrictions have eased, largely on account

403
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,500
of an increasingly strained relationship between the two countries.

404
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,700
Since 2020, the two countries have been going back and forth—China slapped heavy-handed

405
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,700
tariffs on Australian goods from wine and wheat to coal and cotton, while Australia

406
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,720
has called for a critical inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 and expressed concerns

407
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,340
over Chinese behavior in the Pacific, aligning itself closer with the US and the West.

408
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,580
Surprisingly, though, by taking increasingly louder stances against China, and then being

409
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,380
frozen out as retribution, Australian exports haven't plummeted, minimizing the economic

410
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,900
damage that the countries had to ride out.

411
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:17,700
As overall exports from Australia show, not only has it bounced back from COVID and Chinese

412
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,040
tariffs, the sector's as strong as it's ever been.

413
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,100
While diplomatic tensions have begun to cool across 2023, Australia has actually found

414
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:28,480
itself with more leverage than any point prior in its relationship with China.

415
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,500
If China freezes out Australian coal again, for instance, they can simply sell to countries

416
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,160
like India, Japan, and South Korea that are bound to be left high and dry when China's

417
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,700
supply chain shifts.

418
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,160
With 2023 coming to a close, many of you are likely thinking about making some charitable

419
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,800
donations—after all, it's both the season of giving and the last couple of days when

420
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,420
tax-deductible donations can reduce your 2023 tax burden.

421
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,000
With whatever you're able to give, I'm sure you want to be sure that it's as impactful

422
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,780
and influential as possible, but that's a pretty daunting process when essentially

423
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,160
every nonprofit has a compelling argument as to why they're a worthy cause.

424
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,760
Now, you probably already know the solution to this.

425
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,000
When you buy, say, a new mattress, you don't just listen to what the various mattress companies

426
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,900
say, because of course they're all going to say that they're the best.

427
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,400
You look for independent third-party reviews, as that's a far more trustworthy source.

428
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,340
Well, our sponsor, GiveWell, is essentially that independent third-party review source,

429
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
but for nonprofits.

430
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,460
They've spent over 15 years researching charitable organizations and only direct funding

431
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,740
to a few of the highest-impact opportunities they've found.

432
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,700
In fact, people have donated over a billion dollars based on the recommendations they

433
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:40,760
provide since they make it easy—you get all of their research for free and can make

434
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,320
donations right from their site, and they don't take any cut—with the exception

435
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,760
of processing fees, all the money goes to the nonprofit.

436
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,980
Rigorous evidence suggests that over 150,000 lives have been saved through the donations

437
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,800
GiveWell has directed, as relatively small amounts can have a major impact when used

438
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,800
well.

439
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,600
Just one dollar, for example, can distribute a vitamin A supplement in an area where vitamin

440
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,420
A deficiency may increase mortality rates.

441
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,360
And even with GiveWell's already higher impact, you can double yours since, if you've

442
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,360
never donated with them before, they'll match what you contribute up to $100 if you

443
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,060
go to GiveWell.org, pick YouTube, then Wendover as the show.

444
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,400
So thanks in advance for the help you'll provide, and happy holidays.
