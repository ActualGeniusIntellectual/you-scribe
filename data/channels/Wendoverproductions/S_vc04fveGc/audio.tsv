0	4360	More than eight years have passed since I uploaded the very first video to this channel,
4360	7780	and the world was a very different place back in 2015.
7780	12280	Brexit and a Trump presidency both felt like longshots, the term Coronavirus was only known
12280	17000	by epidemiologists and crossword aficionados, same-sex marriage had just been legalized
17000	21200	nationwide in the US, Netflix and other streamers were only just starting to threaten cable
21200	24800	supremacy, TikTok's Chinese predecessor didn't even exist yet.
24800	28880	The eight years since the start of this channel have been extremely consequential in ways
28880	32100	we almost certainly don't yet fully understand.
32100	37240	Often the way we think about a Wendover video is not as the news of the day or week or month,
37240	39600	but rather the news of the year.
39600	43360	We try to cover some of the most consequential changes going on in the world that might be
43360	47940	easy to miss due to how gradually they're unfolding, but with enough time, even the
47940	49720	news of the year changes.
49720	53740	So today, as our last video of this year, we're going to be revisiting nine of our
53740	58240	most popular videos to look at what's different and what isn't, starting with a rare yet
58240	63080	encouraging case where we call out a problem, and then that problem actually starts to get
63080	65000	fixed.
65000	69360	Three years ago, we released a video called The Electric Vehicle Charging Problem.
69360	74660	It argued that perhaps the biggest barrier to greater EV adoption was the charging infrastructure,
74660	78680	rather than the cost of the vehicles themselves, meaning governments would find that incentivizing
78680	82240	cheaper construction would be a better use of their money than offsetting the purchase
82240	85560	price of cars, as was the incentive norm at the time.
85600	89360	Shortly after, quite a lot changed—for the better.
89360	94980	In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, including $5 billion for the construction
94980	98280	of 500,000 fast chargers by 2027.
98280	102720	An additional $2.5 billion was allocated to the brand new Charging and Fueling Infrastructure
102720	107020	Discretionary Grant program, which will give money directly to cities, tribes, and local
107020	111300	governments over the next five years to build even more chargers, essentially solving the
111300	115460	EV charging problem by addressing it from the top down and bottom up.
115460	119980	Already, America's chargers have nearly doubled in number since 2019.
119980	123280	But just because a station has been built doesn't mean it's working.
123280	128480	A consistent sticking point with the country's existing infrastructure has been its unreliability.
128480	132120	Charging a battery with hundreds of kilowatts of energy is vastly more complicated than
132120	137540	filling up a gas tank, as consistent, reliable charging requires a large DC power source,
137540	141980	functioning connectors and receptors, credit card readers, and touch screens, unlike gas
141980	146060	stations, which only require working pumps and credit card readers to dispense fuel that's
146060	147260	then ignited.
147260	151940	The problem is, the largest charging networks for non-Tesla electric vehicles are run by
151940	158100	EVGo and Electrify America, which were both born begrudgingly—EVGo for NRG Energy to
158100	162200	gain regulatory compliance, and Electrify America as part of Volkswagen's Emissions
162200	163200	Gate settlement.
163200	167460	Therefore, they've not always been the most customer-friendly, and each has been criticized
167460	172060	for a high number of non-working chargers, which can strand drivers due to limited alternatives,
172060	176600	but to help solve the issue, the Biden administration allocated an additional $100 million this
176600	179300	year for EV infrastructure repairs.
179300	182740	And there's good news for consumers who have issues with Combined Charging System,
182740	184300	or CCS plugins.
184300	188840	CCS has emerged as the dominant non-Tesla charging port standard in the US, but that
188840	194460	means there are two redundant yet still sparse systems of chargers—one for Tesla drivers
194460	196780	and one for everyone else.
196780	202500	But following a flurry of announcements, from 2025 on, nearly all North American EV
202500	207300	manufacturers will adopt the Tesla, now known as the North American Charging Standard, which
207300	210220	they argue is better for consumers.
210220	214120	Millions will be able to access Tesla's nationwide charging network before the Inflation
214120	216340	Reduction Act's chargers are complete.
216340	220660	The Tesla charging port is objectively more user-friendly than the CCS port—it's less
220660	226260	than half the size, plugs in easier, and can alternate between supplying AC and DC energy.
226260	231100	Plus, Tesla must open its charging network to non-Tesla EVs to qualify for funding from
231100	235420	the Inflation Reduction Act, which means consumers with pre-existing CCS ports can tap in to
235420	240420	an increasing number of Tesla chargers with retrofitted dual ports already.
240420	244140	On the other side of the globe, nearly two years after we released our video titled The
244140	248540	Failed Logistics of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainians are still in the midst
248540	250060	of a war with Russia.
250060	253840	In the invasion's opening weeks, we covered how logistics failures were a major cause
253840	258560	of Russia's unexpected failure to capture Kiev, and having identified this weakness,
258560	263240	Ukraine went on to strategically target Russian logistics infrastructure as the war continued.
263240	267940	As the saying goes, amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, when it comes
267940	269220	to warfare.
269220	273400	This is helping Ukraine maintain their ground against the comparatively massive Russian
273400	274400	military.
274400	278440	Ukraine's primary strategy has involved splitting its troops and tanks equally between
278440	282920	its eastern and southern borders to find and exploit cracks in Russia's defenses.
282920	287920	Since March 2022, Ukrainian forces have reclaimed half of the territory taken by Russia, from
287920	289040	here to here.
289040	293360	In fact, Russian forces were forced to pivot their strategy after the opening days of the
293360	297360	war, and later abandoned its northern front here, as their logistical hurdles there had
297360	299880	become too difficult to overcome.
299880	303560	Because Russia can't get frontline supplies far into Ukraine, they've had to rely on
303560	308780	civilian vehicles to transport goods and switch from long-range missiles to unguided munitions,
308780	312620	as they ran low on precision missiles after failing to overtake Ukraine's forces in
312620	314360	the opening days of the war.
314360	318440	Where Russia still holds land in eastern Ukraine, they've erected miles of blockades that
318440	322420	essentially require brute force, rather than guerrilla warfare, to reclaim.
322420	327140	They planted tens of thousands of mines and built miles of concrete barriers, which along
327140	331180	with strategic vehicle traps, stalled Ukraine's counteroffensive for months.
331180	335540	Russia's been able to hold out so long because of its ability to acquire weapons and vehicles
335540	340300	for the front lines, in spite of its needs-averse pull military strategy.
340300	344420	Russia still has the upper hand for artillery, as they fired an estimated 10 to 11 million
344420	348260	rounds last year with their manufacturing and transportation capacities, which means
348260	351780	Ukraine is still dependent on Western countries for supplies.
351780	356140	Ukraine's logistics could also be threatened by its other enemy—corruption.
356140	360100	President Zelensky has continually replaced cabinet officials and military officers, as
360100	364420	well as the nation's defense minister, to stave off an endemic problem until the war
364420	365420	ends.
365420	371020	Here on St Helena, things have changed as much as they can on a remote Atlantic island
371020	375200	since we released our documentary, The World's Most Useful Airport, in 2019.
375200	379220	It covered how runway design issues meant St Helena could never get the flights it truly
379220	382060	wanted—a direct connection to London, its capital.
382060	385920	This would have both allowed for easier trips to locals to visit family, and easier trips
385920	388100	for the likeliest inbound tourist market.
388100	393780	Well, St Helena finally got London flights—just not exactly in the form it wanted.
393780	398500	You see, as COVID shut down borders globally, it became impractical and financially infeasible
398500	402740	for the commercial airline, Aerling, to continue to fly flights from its hub in Johannesburg,
402740	407180	leaving the island without air service—but St Helena still needed air service to keep
407180	410020	supplies and people going in and out.
410020	416140	Therefore, non-stop flights began from London—albeit only every three weeks, paid for by the government,
416140	418980	and only with the select few passengers cleared to come to the island.
418980	424040	You see, thanks to its isolation and severe border restrictions, in 2021, St Helena was
424040	429200	one of just three jurisdictions globally to have avoided even a single COVID case.
429200	434020	After all, individuals could only enter after a 14-day quarantine, negative PCR test, and
434020	435300	constant masking.
435300	439660	St Helena's extreme isolation worked to its advantage during a global pandemic, as
439660	444220	it kept its 4,500 islanders safe, yet it got in the way of its mission to grow a self-sustaining
444220	448100	tourism economy, as its two hotels shuttered for over a year.
448100	453500	In September 2022, though, St Helena dropped its vaccination, masking, and quarantine policies,
453500	457820	and as a promising sign of rebound, recently announced that a second weekly flight will
457820	461020	resume flying from Johannesburg to St Helena every Tuesday.
461020	466300	And as tourism works to rebound, St Helena hit another major milestone that could transform
466300	471980	its economy and relationship with the outside world—it was finally connected to fiber-optic
471980	473200	internet.
473200	479360	Since 1989, the island has relied on a single satellite dish to carry all internet transmissions.
479360	483460	Because St Helena is so small, it's held out with this slow, sometimes sporadic satellite
483460	488280	dish for quite a long time, which has made islanders beholden to a telecom monopoly,
488280	489280	Shur.
489280	493500	As Shur was the only internet and TV provider, they set higher than average prices, even
493500	498680	charging islanders 600% premiums for any additional data usage incurred, despite the inherent
498680	501720	limitations of internet speeds routed through a single dish.
501760	505920	Therefore, while islanders had practical access to email and web browsing, it was perhaps
505920	511200	one of the last places on earth where innovations like web streaming and calls were an impractical
511200	512200	luxury.
512200	518380	But, in 2018, the European Union granted the island 21.5 million euros as part of its European
518380	523120	Development Fund to construct and maintain an undersea fiber-optic cable capable of transmitting
523120	525400	80 terabits per second.
525400	530040	Essentially, St Helena paid Google to construct a branch of the tech giant's Aquano cable,
530040	532960	which goes from here to here along the coast of Africa.
532960	537540	To offset the costs, the island plans to develop a satellite ground station business, working
537540	541440	with companies like Starlink to use their unique geographic position to link satellites
541440	544880	passing over the area of the Atlantic to the wider internet through the cable.
544880	549640	It's a project that will change the island physically, economically, and culturally.
549640	554480	St Helena will have the necessary infrastructure to support a strong, consistent internet connection,
554480	557280	with its extra data transmissions generating extra revenue.
557640	561560	It's a viable project model that other remote islands, like Tristan da Cunha, could also
561560	564840	replicate, with the cable now up and running and in beta testing.
564840	571800	So, as decisive as this decade will be for St Helena, it's already proven to be unparalleled.
571800	576040	While interconnectedness is now ushering in a new, more prosperous era in St Helena's
576040	580840	story, the pandemic, meanwhile, exposed the vulnerabilities of globalization.
580840	585220	We all remember the supply chain crisis—it crippled the industrial sector globally and
585220	589460	left consumers without products, as well as a lot of ships, out at sea.
589460	593640	Increased demand, bottlenecked ports, price increases, and more set this off, and then
593640	596740	each was magnified by the COVID-induced labor shortage.
596740	600980	But, when we first talked about this in our video, Why There Are So Many Shortages, we
600980	606580	called out the real Achilles heel of the sector—just-in-time manufacturing.
606580	609940	Businesses operated using the traditional just-in-case manufacturing model until the
609940	614260	1980s, building up inventories at each step in the process to assure the next phase wouldn't
614300	617060	be disrupted, even though they might exceed demand.
617060	620820	Eventually, though, manufacturers realized that all this surplus inventory was costing
620820	622540	them, reducing profit.
622540	627180	To disrupt that, a new model, introduced and developed by Toyota, shifted the process to
627180	628580	just-in-time.
628580	632780	Among other benefits, it freed up storage space and cash, and it worked… until it
632780	633780	didn't.
633780	637780	When labor shortages struck and cross-specific container movements slowed down, it caused
637780	641840	shipping delays and manufacturers weren't getting their parts just-in-time.
641840	647320	The crisis exposed a weakness in the just-in-time supply chain, so now, two years on, companies
647320	648600	are adapting.
648600	652620	Even though its causes and repercussions are weakening, the possibility of future disruptions
652620	656660	from events such as war or climate change are risks that businesses are increasingly
656660	659200	realizing they're not willing to take.
659200	662920	Instead of reverting back to one specific model, they're pulling pieces from several
662920	665920	and customizing their supply chains to work for them.
665920	667400	Take Volkswagen, for example.
667800	673160	When the disruptions of 2022 hit, the company saw a 7% decline in vehicles delivered, partially
673160	675400	due to the global semiconductor shortage.
675400	679760	Today, the company has not only diversified its semiconductor sourcing, expanding beyond
679760	684120	South Korean manufacturers and partnering with both European supplier STMicroelectronics
684120	688720	and Taiwan's TSMC, but has also set up an in-house cross-reference system to identify
688720	693420	shortages before they happen and find alternatives to silicon semiconductor chips.
693420	697840	This safety net is even more critical with the increasing market share of semiconductor-heavy
697840	699160	electric vehicles.
699160	704280	But building supply chain resiliency goes beyond just diversifying and sourcing alternatives.
704280	708820	Companies are also bringing operations geographically closer to home, called nearshoring, so they're
708820	710880	less exposed to global forces.
710880	715240	This is seen in the major migration of what was once Chinese manufacturing to Mexico,
715240	718700	as we covered in another video this year, which makes for shorter delivery times to
718700	723220	the US and Canada, easier quality control, and better supply chain resiliency due to
723220	724480	the LAN connection.
724480	728460	To continue playing the supply chain game, companies are also buffering or double-sourcing
728460	733340	where they can by identifying critical pieces, say a semiconductor chip in the supply chain,
733340	737180	and they're short-gaming the system by stockpiling just that specific part.
737180	741820	And of course, if AI wasn't part of the solution, then it wouldn't be 2023.
741820	745300	Companies are using smart technology to stop woes before they start.
745300	749180	AI can analyze output models and predict where a bottleneck or disruption may occur,
749180	753140	and it can also keep a running inventory and automatically reorder parts when they run
753140	754820	low.
754820	759100	Back in 2017, when we talked about the Little Plane War, it was following an intense corporate
759100	763460	volley between Bombardier and Embraer, two medium-sized companies manufacturing mid-haul
763460	768300	planes, and subsequently two very large companies, Boeing and Airbus, who wanted a piece of that
768300	769300	market.
769300	773140	The problem was that neither Bombardier nor Embraer had an in with the American commercial
773140	777500	aircraft market, the most lucrative in the world, and neither Boeing nor Airbus was making
777500	781780	a plane to meet the demand for smaller aircraft to service America's smaller airports.
781780	786580	To get ahead in the US, Bombardier undersold or dumped dozens of its C-series planes to
786580	788960	Delta, and Boeing didn't like that move.
788960	792900	In response, the American company filed a petition with the US Department of Commerce,
792900	793900	and it worked.
793900	799800	With Bombardier facing a 300% import tariff, it instead sold 50.1% of its shares to Airbus,
799800	804240	a European plane manufacturer with enormous purchasing and marketing power.
804240	807960	Also part of Airbus's appeal was the fact that it had a final assembly plant in Mobile,
807960	812260	Alabama, which meant its planes were technically American-made, at least partially, and that
812260	814160	waived foreign import fees.
814160	819400	Airbus quickly rebranded the C-series as the A220 to compete with Boeing 737, and the first
819400	823480	A220 made in Alabama took to the skies in June 2020.
823480	827280	Back then, some independent analysts predicted that the C-series would capture as much as
827280	831360	60% of the mid-haul market segment, with a goal to meet a demand of 3,000 planes over
831360	834640	the next 20 years, or about 12 and a half planes a month.
834640	839080	By 2022, Bombardier sold off its remaining interest to Airbus to focus exclusively on
839080	840880	its business aviation market.
840880	845080	In retrospect, this was clearly prudent, as it helped spur a 180-degree turnaround
845080	850520	from near-bankruptcy just years prior to $7.6 billion in profit in 2022.
850520	855160	Today, the A220 program is jointly owned by Airbus, its parent company, and the Canadian
855160	857980	province of Quebec, with a 25% share.
857980	864040	The two entities agreed to further invest in the A220 to a tune of $1.2 billion in 2022,
864040	867840	mostly in an effort to accelerate its total production to 14 per month between its plant
867840	870880	in Mobile and its headquarters in Mirabelle, Quebec.
870880	873320	That, however, has been slow.
873320	879040	In 2022, Airbus averaged just 4.5 A220 aircraft deliveries per month, thanks in part to supply
879040	880120	chain issues.
880120	884960	By late 2023, the company had manufactured a total of nearly 100 A220s.
884960	887880	Boeing, on the other hand, is playing catch-up.
887880	892760	It lacks a direct competitor aircraft to the A220, meaning it effectively seeded this smallest
892760	897240	sector of the aircraft market, so Airbus is clunkily hanging on to the market majority
897240	900600	and the plane war goes on.
900600	905400	Back in 2019, we released the video, How Rwanda is Becoming the Singapore of Africa, which
905400	910280	detailed President Pakigame's ascendancy and, at that point, 19-year reign in leading
910280	914280	the sub-Saharan country into prosperity—a transformation he hoped could be likened to
914280	918440	Singapore, one of the biggest success stories from Asia's era of rapid development.
918440	923400	Singapore excelled in three areas—geographic centrality, political stability, and ease
923400	928140	of doing business—and we noted where Rwanda was also meeting or improving on those.
928140	933260	At the time, indicators in Rwanda were promising—political stability was near the 50th percentile compared
933260	936920	to the rest of the globe, and the control of corruption near the 70th percentile, while
936920	939380	the country's GDP was quickly rising.
939380	943140	Since then, the pandemic, of course, stalled progress, but though the economy has been
943140	948360	quicker to recover, some indicators are now plateauing or even starting to fall.
948360	953500	Four years ago, it was notable that Kagame was still in power and had no plans for succession—this
953500	957660	raised eyebrows—and today, well, he's still at the helm.
957660	962120	While undeniably effective, bringing Rwanda from a genocidal crisis to a regional leader
962120	967100	in stability and development, questions on whether Kagame's means justify his ends
967100	969460	are becoming easier to answer.
969460	974240	In 2021, the US State Department released a report detailing several human rights violations,
974240	978820	which included, quote, unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government and forced disappearance
978820	980260	by the government.
980260	984700	Among those is poet and social critic Innocent Baty, who remains missing.
984700	989460	Then, there's the case of Paul Rusesabagina, who's known for his role in saving thousands
989460	994060	of lives during the genocide, as depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda,
994060	997780	but more recently for having been kidnapped by the Rwandan government.
997780	1002300	Rusesabagina was a vocal critic of the Kagame administration before he boarded a private
1002300	1006660	flight from Dubai to Burundi for a speaking engagement, or so he thought.
1006660	1010920	Instead, he was sedated and flown against his will to Kigali, where he was detained
1010920	1015020	and held in solitary confinement before the government found him guilty on terrorism-related
1015020	1018980	charges and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.
1018980	1024060	Eventually, as of early 2023, he is now out on commutation following international political
1024060	1028340	pressure, yet this demonstrates the direction the country, and especially its leader, is
1028340	1029340	heading.
1029340	1032940	While it's long been understood that civil rights and freedoms are limited in Rwanda,
1032940	1037100	proponents of Kagame's argue that they were necessary to take the country from its genocide
1037100	1039300	to its current era of relative prosperity.
1039300	1044540	But perhaps because those rights violations are becoming more egregious, that era of prosperity
1044540	1047260	is looking like it could be coming to an end.
1047260	1051500	The murder rate has increased to four per 100,000, the average life expectancy has dropped
1051500	1055780	a year, and both the corruption and political stability percentiles have decreased at least
1055780	1057380	one percentage point.
1057380	1061560	But things are looking more promising from an economic perspective—businesses are continuing
1061560	1063260	to invest in Rwanda.
1063260	1068180	Most notably, Rwandair entered a partnership with Qatar Airways, which purchased a 49%
1068180	1071300	minority stake in the state-owned national airline.
1071300	1076340	Together they've invested in the new Begasara International Airport, a $1.3 billion project
1076340	1080860	that's under construction and set to handle 7 million passengers and 150 million tons
1080900	1084820	of cargo each year and act as a regional hub for sub-Saharan Africa.
1084820	1089540	It's slated for completion in 2026, and to meet that growth, Rwandair is doubling
1089540	1092600	its fleet from 13 to 26 planes.
1092600	1097700	Other businesses are taking note—Volkswagen, Motorola Solutions, Andela, and Radisson have
1097700	1099420	planted flags in Rwanda.
1099420	1104100	The country continues to shift and craft policy to entice foreign direct investment, and a
1104100	1107540	2023 US State Department report says that it's quote, easy to launch a business in
1107540	1110740	Rwanda, but making it profitable can be a challenge.
1110740	1118920	And yet, the GDP continues to climb, growing 8.2% in 2022, hitting $13.31 billion.
1118920	1123500	In the fall, Kagame announced he would run for re-election again in 2024, which is only
1123500	1128000	possible because his government extended term limits in 2015, and so the fate of the country
1128000	1130420	appears to remain in his hands.
1130420	1134660	And just as we said four years ago, it'll be up to him and his administration to improve
1134660	1138980	upon the political climate in order to make foreign direct investment attractive and stable.
1139260	1141860	It's not yet Singapore, but it's still trying.
1141860	1143580	Then there's China.
1143580	1148260	Now, if you're an aspiring educational YouTuber, here's a tip—make videos about China.
1148260	1152440	It's an interesting, dynamic place that just does numbers.
1152440	1156340	A lot happens there, and a lot has changed since we started making videos dealing with
1156340	1157340	the country.
1157340	1158980	Take, for instance, this one.
1158980	1164060	It's five years old, it did 9 million views, and while its main points still hold true,
1164060	1167740	how exactly China is making Africa its own China has shifted.
1167740	1171680	Now, the video's claim was that much of the continent is economically and politically
1171680	1175860	aligned with China, simply because China has pumped huge amounts of money into the continent
1175860	1176980	of Africa.
1176980	1181760	This much is still true today—China is still Africa's biggest financial supporter, only
1181760	1185220	pumping more and more foreign direct aid into the continent.
1185220	1188760	And as to why they're investing, well, that hasn't changed either—it's because of
1188760	1192860	what comes back in the form of cheaper labor, resources, and goods.
1192860	1194380	And the form of Chinese investment?
1194380	1198780	That's pretty much the same too, as most investment comes through large to very large
1198780	1200060	infrastructure projects.
1200060	1203500	What's changed has to do with, well, time.
1203500	1207540	Like every big project, the beginning's usually marked with excitement, but success
1207540	1210680	ultimately comes down to execution further down the road.
1210680	1214460	Take this light rail system that the original video identified as an impressive example
1214460	1219400	of Chinese investment in Ethiopia as it established sub-Saharan Africa's first inner-city tram
1219400	1220400	in 2015.
1220440	1224760	Well, now this system's proving difficult to keep running on time while operating costs
1224760	1227400	continue to crawl higher and higher.
1227400	1232300	Already by 2018, outside observers had identified that the system had a fundamental electricity
1232300	1235540	supply issue, which has only gotten worse since.
1235540	1241840	As of 2020, the system that once ran 41 trains across two lines was now only running 17.
1241840	1246920	As of 2023, average traffic had dropped to about 50% of the high-water mark, while waits
1246920	1250360	along the green line had ballooned to 19 minutes.
1250360	1254040	The problem is, it's hard for Ethiopian officials to keep the system running when
1254040	1257980	it can't get spare parts easily and lack the institutional knowledge required to fix
1257980	1260360	the Chinese-manufactured trainset.
1260360	1264800	This transit system is a microcosm for how Chinese investment in Africa has played out
1264800	1265800	more broadly.
1265800	1269920	They break ground on exciting projects that promise to aid African development, but the
1269920	1274480	projects prove ultimately flawed by a lack of foresight and an over-serving of blind
1274480	1275480	optimism.
1275480	1279440	For African countries with newfound experience in the difficulty of the upkeep and follow-through
1279440	1283440	on these infrastructure projects, some leaders are becoming more cautious of welcoming them
1283440	1288040	in while, for its part, China, now more wary of the cost of large-scale infrastructure
1288040	1292220	investment, is beginning to slow its role too, leading to serious belt-tightening on
1292220	1295080	these projects that have come to comprise the Belt and Road Initiative.
1295080	1298900	And it's not just the money leaving China that's changing, either.
1298900	1302920	The nation's robust manufacturing sector that has spearheaded its massive export economy
1302920	1306760	for decades has started to take a different shape in the last few years.
1306760	1311800	Chinese manufacturing still wins, but it's winning less, now six years later.
1311800	1315660	So too has this channel, as six years ago I actually traveled to make this, making my
1315660	1320640	way to the capital of Chinese technology manufacturing, Shenzhen, in the Guangdong province, so I
1320640	1322600	went there to see what it was like.
1322600	1326200	This was the first time I ever traveled for a video, thanks to an invitation by the company
1326200	1327200	Anchor.
1327200	1330040	Back then, they were a burgeoning startup that was just celebrating making their way
1330040	1334080	into Walmart, but today they've grown into a Chinese entrepreneurship success story,
1334080	1336700	and a company there's a good shot you've heard of.
1336700	1342560	Shenzhen as a city is really known for two things, one is its manufacturing capabilities,
1342560	1351500	especially for consumer electronics products, and second is gravitation for talents or human
1351500	1357680	resources, especially on the product development and research and development disciplines.
1357680	1359520	Six years on, this is still the case.
1359520	1363560	Shenzhen is the hardware capital of the world, and still home to some of the biggest tech
1364040	1367640	manufacturers, but not quite to the level it once was.
1367640	1373000	Take this motion graphic—Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, Canon—they all manufacture
1373000	1375680	products here in Shenzhen.
1375680	1376680	Or they did.
1376680	1381000	In 2018, Samsung closed its factory in Shenzhen.
1381000	1384160	More recently, Canon has closed its Zhuhai plant.
1384160	1388320	As for Microsoft, Sony, and Apple, they remain in the city, but the latter two have minimized
1388320	1392000	their presence within the country, with Sony moving all its camera-making facilities to
1392000	1393120	different countries.
1393680	1397280	Shenzhen is still the dominant power in the tech world, but it's giving up ground, and
1397280	1400340	that much can be said of Chinese manufacturing overall.
1400340	1405440	This is manufacturing output from China from 2004 to 2022—it's doing broadly what it
1405440	1409260	should be doing, going up and to the right with a stagnation during the COVID years.
1409260	1413760	The thing is, it's shrinking as a percentage of China's GDP—where it sat in the low
1413760	1419220	30s during the early 2010s, it's now in the mid-to-high 20s in the early 2020s.
1419220	1422100	This is all because the Chinese economy is changing.
1422100	1425860	As it makes strides towards middle-income status, China's economy is trending towards
1425860	1430140	services rather than manufacturing, and as standards of living and wages increase, the
1430140	1433460	benefits of manufacturing in China are becoming less obvious.
1433460	1437820	This, along with added geopolitical tensions, has turned some countries towards so-called
1437820	1442560	China-plus-one strategies, where they maintain a factory foothold in the country, but also
1442560	1447240	diversify their supply chain with factories in, say, Vietnam, so should a COVID strand
1447240	1451440	or a spat in the South China Sea turn off supply from Shenzhen, the company can stay
1451440	1452440	afloat.
1452440	1456160	Or, companies are beginning to outright skip on China's relatively cheap labor for options
1456160	1460120	close to home, which has to do with lessons learned with COVID shortages mentioned earlier,
1460120	1464300	as well as the exciting potential of other manufacturing bases, as, once again, we mentioned
1464300	1465540	in this year's video.
1465540	1469460	In this case of Mexico, both American and Chinese companies hoping to be nearer to the
1469460	1474000	US, while still benefiting from less expensive labor, have moved operations to just south
1474000	1475420	of the American border.
1475420	1479420	As it factors within China, and outside of China, the nation's manufacturing might
1479420	1485020	has shown cracks in the last few years, but still, for now, it wins—just by a narrower
1485020	1486420	margin than before.
1486420	1491080	Now, if there's a theme throughout these China videos revisited, it's that, broadly,
1491080	1494780	the way the world interacts with the country has shifted throughout the early years of
1494780	1495780	this decade.
1495780	1500500	COVID-19, of course, is a major part of this story, but it's not all of it.
1500500	1502860	Take this video, Australia's China Problem.
1502860	1506900	Between it, we make the point that Australia has hitched its wagon to China economically,
1506900	1511260	putting it in a difficult spot where it doesn't align socially, culturally, or in some cases
1511260	1513040	morally, with the regional power.
1513040	1516980	To illustrate the economic tethering between the two nations, we highlighted higher education
1516980	1521020	and raw minerals as two sectors where Australia's come to lean on China.
1521020	1525220	Well, now Australia has begun to work towards addressing its dangerous reliance on trade
1525220	1528460	with China, and it's doing so within those sectors.
1528460	1532020	This is a graph of Chinese students enrolled in Australian higher education.
1532020	1536380	Now, obviously, the initial decline can be attributed to COVID-19, but in the last two
1536380	1541540	years the numbers have remained lower even as restrictions have eased, largely on account
1541540	1544500	of an increasingly strained relationship between the two countries.
1544500	1548700	Since 2020, the two countries have been going back and forth—China slapped heavy-handed
1548700	1552700	tariffs on Australian goods from wine and wheat to coal and cotton, while Australia
1552700	1556720	has called for a critical inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 and expressed concerns
1556720	1561340	over Chinese behavior in the Pacific, aligning itself closer with the US and the West.
1561340	1565580	Surprisingly, though, by taking increasingly louder stances against China, and then being
1565580	1570380	frozen out as retribution, Australian exports haven't plummeted, minimizing the economic
1570380	1572900	damage that the countries had to ride out.
1572900	1577700	As overall exports from Australia show, not only has it bounced back from COVID and Chinese
1577700	1580040	tariffs, the sector's as strong as it's ever been.
1580040	1584100	While diplomatic tensions have begun to cool across 2023, Australia has actually found
1584100	1588480	itself with more leverage than any point prior in its relationship with China.
1588480	1592500	If China freezes out Australian coal again, for instance, they can simply sell to countries
1592500	1597160	like India, Japan, and South Korea that are bound to be left high and dry when China's
1597160	1599700	supply chain shifts.
1599700	1604160	With 2023 coming to a close, many of you are likely thinking about making some charitable
1604160	1607800	donations—after all, it's both the season of giving and the last couple of days when
1607800	1611420	tax-deductible donations can reduce your 2023 tax burden.
1611420	1615000	With whatever you're able to give, I'm sure you want to be sure that it's as impactful
1615000	1618780	and influential as possible, but that's a pretty daunting process when essentially
1618780	1623160	every nonprofit has a compelling argument as to why they're a worthy cause.
1623160	1625760	Now, you probably already know the solution to this.
1625760	1630000	When you buy, say, a new mattress, you don't just listen to what the various mattress companies
1630000	1633900	say, because of course they're all going to say that they're the best.
1633900	1638400	You look for independent third-party reviews, as that's a far more trustworthy source.
1638400	1643340	Well, our sponsor, GiveWell, is essentially that independent third-party review source,
1643340	1644340	but for nonprofits.
1644680	1649460	They've spent over 15 years researching charitable organizations and only direct funding
1649460	1652740	to a few of the highest-impact opportunities they've found.
1652740	1656700	In fact, people have donated over a billion dollars based on the recommendations they
1656700	1660760	provide since they make it easy—you get all of their research for free and can make
1660760	1664320	donations right from their site, and they don't take any cut—with the exception
1664320	1667760	of processing fees, all the money goes to the nonprofit.
1667760	1671980	Rigorous evidence suggests that over 150,000 lives have been saved through the donations
1671980	1676800	GiveWell has directed, as relatively small amounts can have a major impact when used
1676800	1677800	well.
1677800	1681600	Just one dollar, for example, can distribute a vitamin A supplement in an area where vitamin
1681600	1684420	A deficiency may increase mortality rates.
1684420	1688360	And even with GiveWell's already higher impact, you can double yours since, if you've
1688360	1692360	never donated with them before, they'll match what you contribute up to $100 if you
1692360	1696060	go to GiveWell.org, pick YouTube, then Wendover as the show.
1696060	1699400	So thanks in advance for the help you'll provide, and happy holidays.
