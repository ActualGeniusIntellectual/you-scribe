00:00.000 --> 00:04.360
More than eight years have passed since I uploaded the very first video to this channel,

00:04.360 --> 00:07.780
and the world was a very different place back in 2015.

00:07.780 --> 00:12.280
Brexit and a Trump presidency both felt like longshots, the term Coronavirus was only known

00:12.280 --> 00:17.000
by epidemiologists and crossword aficionados, same-sex marriage had just been legalized

00:17.000 --> 00:21.200
nationwide in the US, Netflix and other streamers were only just starting to threaten cable

00:21.200 --> 00:24.800
supremacy, TikTok's Chinese predecessor didn't even exist yet.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.880
The eight years since the start of this channel have been extremely consequential in ways

00:28.880 --> 00:32.100
we almost certainly don't yet fully understand.

00:32.100 --> 00:37.240
Often the way we think about a Wendover video is not as the news of the day or week or month,

00:37.240 --> 00:39.600
but rather the news of the year.

00:39.600 --> 00:43.360
We try to cover some of the most consequential changes going on in the world that might be

00:43.360 --> 00:47.940
easy to miss due to how gradually they're unfolding, but with enough time, even the

00:47.940 --> 00:49.720
news of the year changes.

00:49.720 --> 00:53.740
So today, as our last video of this year, we're going to be revisiting nine of our

00:53.740 --> 00:58.240
most popular videos to look at what's different and what isn't, starting with a rare yet

00:58.240 --> 01:03.080
encouraging case where we call out a problem, and then that problem actually starts to get

01:03.080 --> 01:05.000
fixed.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.360
Three years ago, we released a video called The Electric Vehicle Charging Problem.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.660
It argued that perhaps the biggest barrier to greater EV adoption was the charging infrastructure,

01:14.660 --> 01:18.680
rather than the cost of the vehicles themselves, meaning governments would find that incentivizing

01:18.680 --> 01:22.240
cheaper construction would be a better use of their money than offsetting the purchase

01:22.240 --> 01:25.560
price of cars, as was the incentive norm at the time.

01:25.600 --> 01:29.360
Shortly after, quite a lot changed—for the better.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.980
In 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, including $5 billion for the construction

01:34.980 --> 01:38.280
of 500,000 fast chargers by 2027.

01:38.280 --> 01:42.720
An additional $2.5 billion was allocated to the brand new Charging and Fueling Infrastructure

01:42.720 --> 01:47.020
Discretionary Grant program, which will give money directly to cities, tribes, and local

01:47.020 --> 01:51.300
governments over the next five years to build even more chargers, essentially solving the

01:51.300 --> 01:55.460
EV charging problem by addressing it from the top down and bottom up.

01:55.460 --> 01:59.980
Already, America's chargers have nearly doubled in number since 2019.

01:59.980 --> 02:03.280
But just because a station has been built doesn't mean it's working.

02:03.280 --> 02:08.480
A consistent sticking point with the country's existing infrastructure has been its unreliability.

02:08.480 --> 02:12.120
Charging a battery with hundreds of kilowatts of energy is vastly more complicated than

02:12.120 --> 02:17.540
filling up a gas tank, as consistent, reliable charging requires a large DC power source,

02:17.540 --> 02:21.980
functioning connectors and receptors, credit card readers, and touch screens, unlike gas

02:21.980 --> 02:26.060
stations, which only require working pumps and credit card readers to dispense fuel that's

02:26.060 --> 02:27.260
then ignited.

02:27.260 --> 02:31.940
The problem is, the largest charging networks for non-Tesla electric vehicles are run by

02:31.940 --> 02:38.100
EVGo and Electrify America, which were both born begrudgingly—EVGo for NRG Energy to

02:38.100 --> 02:42.200
gain regulatory compliance, and Electrify America as part of Volkswagen's Emissions

02:42.200 --> 02:43.200
Gate settlement.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.460
Therefore, they've not always been the most customer-friendly, and each has been criticized

02:47.460 --> 02:52.060
for a high number of non-working chargers, which can strand drivers due to limited alternatives,

02:52.060 --> 02:56.600
but to help solve the issue, the Biden administration allocated an additional $100 million this

02:56.600 --> 02:59.300
year for EV infrastructure repairs.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.740
And there's good news for consumers who have issues with Combined Charging System,

03:02.740 --> 03:04.300
or CCS plugins.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.840
CCS has emerged as the dominant non-Tesla charging port standard in the US, but that

03:08.840 --> 03:14.460
means there are two redundant yet still sparse systems of chargers—one for Tesla drivers

03:14.460 --> 03:16.780
and one for everyone else.

03:16.780 --> 03:22.500
But following a flurry of announcements, from 2025 on, nearly all North American EV

03:22.500 --> 03:27.300
manufacturers will adopt the Tesla, now known as the North American Charging Standard, which

03:27.300 --> 03:30.220
they argue is better for consumers.

03:30.220 --> 03:34.120
Millions will be able to access Tesla's nationwide charging network before the Inflation

03:34.120 --> 03:36.340
Reduction Act's chargers are complete.

03:36.340 --> 03:40.660
The Tesla charging port is objectively more user-friendly than the CCS port—it's less

03:40.660 --> 03:46.260
than half the size, plugs in easier, and can alternate between supplying AC and DC energy.

03:46.260 --> 03:51.100
Plus, Tesla must open its charging network to non-Tesla EVs to qualify for funding from

03:51.100 --> 03:55.420
the Inflation Reduction Act, which means consumers with pre-existing CCS ports can tap in to

03:55.420 --> 04:00.420
an increasing number of Tesla chargers with retrofitted dual ports already.

04:00.420 --> 04:04.140
On the other side of the globe, nearly two years after we released our video titled The

04:04.140 --> 04:08.540
Failed Logistics of Russia's Invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainians are still in the midst

04:08.540 --> 04:10.060
of a war with Russia.

04:10.060 --> 04:13.840
In the invasion's opening weeks, we covered how logistics failures were a major cause

04:13.840 --> 04:18.560
of Russia's unexpected failure to capture Kiev, and having identified this weakness,

04:18.560 --> 04:23.240
Ukraine went on to strategically target Russian logistics infrastructure as the war continued.

04:23.240 --> 04:27.940
As the saying goes, amateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics, when it comes

04:27.940 --> 04:29.220
to warfare.

04:29.220 --> 04:33.400
This is helping Ukraine maintain their ground against the comparatively massive Russian

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
military.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.440
Ukraine's primary strategy has involved splitting its troops and tanks equally between

04:38.440 --> 04:42.920
its eastern and southern borders to find and exploit cracks in Russia's defenses.

04:42.920 --> 04:47.920
Since March 2022, Ukrainian forces have reclaimed half of the territory taken by Russia, from

04:47.920 --> 04:49.040
here to here.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.360
In fact, Russian forces were forced to pivot their strategy after the opening days of the

04:53.360 --> 04:57.360
war, and later abandoned its northern front here, as their logistical hurdles there had

04:57.360 --> 04:59.880
become too difficult to overcome.

04:59.880 --> 05:03.560
Because Russia can't get frontline supplies far into Ukraine, they've had to rely on

05:03.560 --> 05:08.780
civilian vehicles to transport goods and switch from long-range missiles to unguided munitions,

05:08.780 --> 05:12.620
as they ran low on precision missiles after failing to overtake Ukraine's forces in

05:12.620 --> 05:14.360
the opening days of the war.

05:14.360 --> 05:18.440
Where Russia still holds land in eastern Ukraine, they've erected miles of blockades that

05:18.440 --> 05:22.420
essentially require brute force, rather than guerrilla warfare, to reclaim.

05:22.420 --> 05:27.140
They planted tens of thousands of mines and built miles of concrete barriers, which along

05:27.140 --> 05:31.180
with strategic vehicle traps, stalled Ukraine's counteroffensive for months.

05:31.180 --> 05:35.540
Russia's been able to hold out so long because of its ability to acquire weapons and vehicles

05:35.540 --> 05:40.300
for the front lines, in spite of its needs-averse pull military strategy.

05:40.300 --> 05:44.420
Russia still has the upper hand for artillery, as they fired an estimated 10 to 11 million

05:44.420 --> 05:48.260
rounds last year with their manufacturing and transportation capacities, which means

05:48.260 --> 05:51.780
Ukraine is still dependent on Western countries for supplies.

05:51.780 --> 05:56.140
Ukraine's logistics could also be threatened by its other enemy—corruption.

05:56.140 --> 06:00.100
President Zelensky has continually replaced cabinet officials and military officers, as

06:00.100 --> 06:04.420
well as the nation's defense minister, to stave off an endemic problem until the war

06:04.420 --> 06:05.420
ends.

06:05.420 --> 06:11.020
Here on St Helena, things have changed as much as they can on a remote Atlantic island

06:11.020 --> 06:15.200
since we released our documentary, The World's Most Useful Airport, in 2019.

06:15.200 --> 06:19.220
It covered how runway design issues meant St Helena could never get the flights it truly

06:19.220 --> 06:22.060
wanted—a direct connection to London, its capital.

06:22.060 --> 06:25.920
This would have both allowed for easier trips to locals to visit family, and easier trips

06:25.920 --> 06:28.100
for the likeliest inbound tourist market.

06:28.100 --> 06:33.780
Well, St Helena finally got London flights—just not exactly in the form it wanted.

06:33.780 --> 06:38.500
You see, as COVID shut down borders globally, it became impractical and financially infeasible

06:38.500 --> 06:42.740
for the commercial airline, Aerling, to continue to fly flights from its hub in Johannesburg,

06:42.740 --> 06:47.180
leaving the island without air service—but St Helena still needed air service to keep

06:47.180 --> 06:50.020
supplies and people going in and out.

06:50.020 --> 06:56.140
Therefore, non-stop flights began from London—albeit only every three weeks, paid for by the government,

06:56.140 --> 06:58.980
and only with the select few passengers cleared to come to the island.

06:58.980 --> 07:04.040
You see, thanks to its isolation and severe border restrictions, in 2021, St Helena was

07:04.040 --> 07:09.200
one of just three jurisdictions globally to have avoided even a single COVID case.

07:09.200 --> 07:14.020
After all, individuals could only enter after a 14-day quarantine, negative PCR test, and

07:14.020 --> 07:15.300
constant masking.

07:15.300 --> 07:19.660
St Helena's extreme isolation worked to its advantage during a global pandemic, as

07:19.660 --> 07:24.220
it kept its 4,500 islanders safe, yet it got in the way of its mission to grow a self-sustaining

07:24.220 --> 07:28.100
tourism economy, as its two hotels shuttered for over a year.

07:28.100 --> 07:33.500
In September 2022, though, St Helena dropped its vaccination, masking, and quarantine policies,

07:33.500 --> 07:37.820
and as a promising sign of rebound, recently announced that a second weekly flight will

07:37.820 --> 07:41.020
resume flying from Johannesburg to St Helena every Tuesday.

07:41.020 --> 07:46.300
And as tourism works to rebound, St Helena hit another major milestone that could transform

07:46.300 --> 07:51.980
its economy and relationship with the outside world—it was finally connected to fiber-optic

07:51.980 --> 07:53.200
internet.

07:53.200 --> 07:59.360
Since 1989, the island has relied on a single satellite dish to carry all internet transmissions.

07:59.360 --> 08:03.460
Because St Helena is so small, it's held out with this slow, sometimes sporadic satellite

08:03.460 --> 08:08.280
dish for quite a long time, which has made islanders beholden to a telecom monopoly,

08:08.280 --> 08:09.280
Shur.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.500
As Shur was the only internet and TV provider, they set higher than average prices, even

08:13.500 --> 08:18.680
charging islanders 600% premiums for any additional data usage incurred, despite the inherent

08:18.680 --> 08:21.720
limitations of internet speeds routed through a single dish.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.920
Therefore, while islanders had practical access to email and web browsing, it was perhaps

08:25.920 --> 08:31.200
one of the last places on earth where innovations like web streaming and calls were an impractical

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
luxury.

08:32.200 --> 08:38.380
But, in 2018, the European Union granted the island 21.5 million euros as part of its European

08:38.380 --> 08:43.120
Development Fund to construct and maintain an undersea fiber-optic cable capable of transmitting

08:43.120 --> 08:45.400
80 terabits per second.

08:45.400 --> 08:50.040
Essentially, St Helena paid Google to construct a branch of the tech giant's Aquano cable,

08:50.040 --> 08:52.960
which goes from here to here along the coast of Africa.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.540
To offset the costs, the island plans to develop a satellite ground station business, working

08:57.540 --> 09:01.440
with companies like Starlink to use their unique geographic position to link satellites

09:01.440 --> 09:04.880
passing over the area of the Atlantic to the wider internet through the cable.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.640
It's a project that will change the island physically, economically, and culturally.

09:09.640 --> 09:14.480
St Helena will have the necessary infrastructure to support a strong, consistent internet connection,

09:14.480 --> 09:17.280
with its extra data transmissions generating extra revenue.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.560
It's a viable project model that other remote islands, like Tristan da Cunha, could also

09:21.560 --> 09:24.840
replicate, with the cable now up and running and in beta testing.

09:24.840 --> 09:31.800
So, as decisive as this decade will be for St Helena, it's already proven to be unparalleled.

09:31.800 --> 09:36.040
While interconnectedness is now ushering in a new, more prosperous era in St Helena's

09:36.040 --> 09:40.840
story, the pandemic, meanwhile, exposed the vulnerabilities of globalization.

09:40.840 --> 09:45.220
We all remember the supply chain crisis—it crippled the industrial sector globally and

09:45.220 --> 09:49.460
left consumers without products, as well as a lot of ships, out at sea.

09:49.460 --> 09:53.640
Increased demand, bottlenecked ports, price increases, and more set this off, and then

09:53.640 --> 09:56.740
each was magnified by the COVID-induced labor shortage.

09:56.740 --> 10:00.980
But, when we first talked about this in our video, Why There Are So Many Shortages, we

10:00.980 --> 10:06.580
called out the real Achilles heel of the sector—just-in-time manufacturing.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.940
Businesses operated using the traditional just-in-case manufacturing model until the

10:09.940 --> 10:14.260
1980s, building up inventories at each step in the process to assure the next phase wouldn't

10:14.300 --> 10:17.060
be disrupted, even though they might exceed demand.

10:17.060 --> 10:20.820
Eventually, though, manufacturers realized that all this surplus inventory was costing

10:20.820 --> 10:22.540
them, reducing profit.

10:22.540 --> 10:27.180
To disrupt that, a new model, introduced and developed by Toyota, shifted the process to

10:27.180 --> 10:28.580
just-in-time.

10:28.580 --> 10:32.780
Among other benefits, it freed up storage space and cash, and it worked… until it

10:32.780 --> 10:33.780
didn't.

10:33.780 --> 10:37.780
When labor shortages struck and cross-specific container movements slowed down, it caused

10:37.780 --> 10:41.840
shipping delays and manufacturers weren't getting their parts just-in-time.

10:41.840 --> 10:47.320
The crisis exposed a weakness in the just-in-time supply chain, so now, two years on, companies

10:47.320 --> 10:48.600
are adapting.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.620
Even though its causes and repercussions are weakening, the possibility of future disruptions

10:52.620 --> 10:56.660
from events such as war or climate change are risks that businesses are increasingly

10:56.660 --> 10:59.200
realizing they're not willing to take.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.920
Instead of reverting back to one specific model, they're pulling pieces from several

11:02.920 --> 11:05.920
and customizing their supply chains to work for them.

11:05.920 --> 11:07.400
Take Volkswagen, for example.

11:07.800 --> 11:13.160
When the disruptions of 2022 hit, the company saw a 7% decline in vehicles delivered, partially

11:13.160 --> 11:15.400
due to the global semiconductor shortage.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.760
Today, the company has not only diversified its semiconductor sourcing, expanding beyond

11:19.760 --> 11:24.120
South Korean manufacturers and partnering with both European supplier STMicroelectronics

11:24.120 --> 11:28.720
and Taiwan's TSMC, but has also set up an in-house cross-reference system to identify

11:28.720 --> 11:33.420
shortages before they happen and find alternatives to silicon semiconductor chips.

11:33.420 --> 11:37.840
This safety net is even more critical with the increasing market share of semiconductor-heavy

11:37.840 --> 11:39.160
electric vehicles.

11:39.160 --> 11:44.280
But building supply chain resiliency goes beyond just diversifying and sourcing alternatives.

11:44.280 --> 11:48.820
Companies are also bringing operations geographically closer to home, called nearshoring, so they're

11:48.820 --> 11:50.880
less exposed to global forces.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.240
This is seen in the major migration of what was once Chinese manufacturing to Mexico,

11:55.240 --> 11:58.700
as we covered in another video this year, which makes for shorter delivery times to

11:58.700 --> 12:03.220
the US and Canada, easier quality control, and better supply chain resiliency due to

12:03.220 --> 12:04.480
the LAN connection.

12:04.480 --> 12:08.460
To continue playing the supply chain game, companies are also buffering or double-sourcing

12:08.460 --> 12:13.340
where they can by identifying critical pieces, say a semiconductor chip in the supply chain,

12:13.340 --> 12:17.180
and they're short-gaming the system by stockpiling just that specific part.

12:17.180 --> 12:21.820
And of course, if AI wasn't part of the solution, then it wouldn't be 2023.

12:21.820 --> 12:25.300
Companies are using smart technology to stop woes before they start.

12:25.300 --> 12:29.180
AI can analyze output models and predict where a bottleneck or disruption may occur,

12:29.180 --> 12:33.140
and it can also keep a running inventory and automatically reorder parts when they run

12:33.140 --> 12:34.820
low.

12:34.820 --> 12:39.100
Back in 2017, when we talked about the Little Plane War, it was following an intense corporate

12:39.100 --> 12:43.460
volley between Bombardier and Embraer, two medium-sized companies manufacturing mid-haul

12:43.460 --> 12:48.300
planes, and subsequently two very large companies, Boeing and Airbus, who wanted a piece of that

12:48.300 --> 12:49.300
market.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.140
The problem was that neither Bombardier nor Embraer had an in with the American commercial

12:53.140 --> 12:57.500
aircraft market, the most lucrative in the world, and neither Boeing nor Airbus was making

12:57.500 --> 13:01.780
a plane to meet the demand for smaller aircraft to service America's smaller airports.

13:01.780 --> 13:06.580
To get ahead in the US, Bombardier undersold or dumped dozens of its C-series planes to

13:06.580 --> 13:08.960
Delta, and Boeing didn't like that move.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.900
In response, the American company filed a petition with the US Department of Commerce,

13:12.900 --> 13:13.900
and it worked.

13:13.900 --> 13:19.800
With Bombardier facing a 300% import tariff, it instead sold 50.1% of its shares to Airbus,

13:19.800 --> 13:24.240
a European plane manufacturer with enormous purchasing and marketing power.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.960
Also part of Airbus's appeal was the fact that it had a final assembly plant in Mobile,

13:27.960 --> 13:32.260
Alabama, which meant its planes were technically American-made, at least partially, and that

13:32.260 --> 13:34.160
waived foreign import fees.

13:34.160 --> 13:39.400
Airbus quickly rebranded the C-series as the A220 to compete with Boeing 737, and the first

13:39.400 --> 13:43.480
A220 made in Alabama took to the skies in June 2020.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.280
Back then, some independent analysts predicted that the C-series would capture as much as

13:47.280 --> 13:51.360
60% of the mid-haul market segment, with a goal to meet a demand of 3,000 planes over

13:51.360 --> 13:54.640
the next 20 years, or about 12 and a half planes a month.

13:54.640 --> 13:59.080
By 2022, Bombardier sold off its remaining interest to Airbus to focus exclusively on

13:59.080 --> 14:00.880
its business aviation market.

14:00.880 --> 14:05.080
In retrospect, this was clearly prudent, as it helped spur a 180-degree turnaround

14:05.080 --> 14:10.520
from near-bankruptcy just years prior to $7.6 billion in profit in 2022.

14:10.520 --> 14:15.160
Today, the A220 program is jointly owned by Airbus, its parent company, and the Canadian

14:15.160 --> 14:17.980
province of Quebec, with a 25% share.

14:17.980 --> 14:24.040
The two entities agreed to further invest in the A220 to a tune of $1.2 billion in 2022,

14:24.040 --> 14:27.840
mostly in an effort to accelerate its total production to 14 per month between its plant

14:27.840 --> 14:30.880
in Mobile and its headquarters in Mirabelle, Quebec.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.320
That, however, has been slow.

14:33.320 --> 14:39.040
In 2022, Airbus averaged just 4.5 A220 aircraft deliveries per month, thanks in part to supply

14:39.040 --> 14:40.120
chain issues.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.960
By late 2023, the company had manufactured a total of nearly 100 A220s.

14:44.960 --> 14:47.880
Boeing, on the other hand, is playing catch-up.

14:47.880 --> 14:52.760
It lacks a direct competitor aircraft to the A220, meaning it effectively seeded this smallest

14:52.760 --> 14:57.240
sector of the aircraft market, so Airbus is clunkily hanging on to the market majority

14:57.240 --> 15:00.600
and the plane war goes on.

15:00.600 --> 15:05.400
Back in 2019, we released the video, How Rwanda is Becoming the Singapore of Africa, which

15:05.400 --> 15:10.280
detailed President Pakigame's ascendancy and, at that point, 19-year reign in leading

15:10.280 --> 15:14.280
the sub-Saharan country into prosperity—a transformation he hoped could be likened to

15:14.280 --> 15:18.440
Singapore, one of the biggest success stories from Asia's era of rapid development.

15:18.440 --> 15:23.400
Singapore excelled in three areas—geographic centrality, political stability, and ease

15:23.400 --> 15:28.140
of doing business—and we noted where Rwanda was also meeting or improving on those.

15:28.140 --> 15:33.260
At the time, indicators in Rwanda were promising—political stability was near the 50th percentile compared

15:33.260 --> 15:36.920
to the rest of the globe, and the control of corruption near the 70th percentile, while

15:36.920 --> 15:39.380
the country's GDP was quickly rising.

15:39.380 --> 15:43.140
Since then, the pandemic, of course, stalled progress, but though the economy has been

15:43.140 --> 15:48.360
quicker to recover, some indicators are now plateauing or even starting to fall.

15:48.360 --> 15:53.500
Four years ago, it was notable that Kagame was still in power and had no plans for succession—this

15:53.500 --> 15:57.660
raised eyebrows—and today, well, he's still at the helm.

15:57.660 --> 16:02.120
While undeniably effective, bringing Rwanda from a genocidal crisis to a regional leader

16:02.120 --> 16:07.100
in stability and development, questions on whether Kagame's means justify his ends

16:07.100 --> 16:09.460
are becoming easier to answer.

16:09.460 --> 16:14.240
In 2021, the US State Department released a report detailing several human rights violations,

16:14.240 --> 16:18.820
which included, quote, unlawful or arbitrary killings by the government and forced disappearance

16:18.820 --> 16:20.260
by the government.

16:20.260 --> 16:24.700
Among those is poet and social critic Innocent Baty, who remains missing.

16:24.700 --> 16:29.460
Then, there's the case of Paul Rusesabagina, who's known for his role in saving thousands

16:29.460 --> 16:34.060
of lives during the genocide, as depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Hotel Rwanda,

16:34.060 --> 16:37.780
but more recently for having been kidnapped by the Rwandan government.

16:37.780 --> 16:42.300
Rusesabagina was a vocal critic of the Kagame administration before he boarded a private

16:42.300 --> 16:46.660
flight from Dubai to Burundi for a speaking engagement, or so he thought.

16:46.660 --> 16:50.920
Instead, he was sedated and flown against his will to Kigali, where he was detained

16:50.920 --> 16:55.020
and held in solitary confinement before the government found him guilty on terrorism-related

16:55.020 --> 16:58.980
charges and sentenced him to 25 years in prison.

16:58.980 --> 17:04.060
Eventually, as of early 2023, he is now out on commutation following international political

17:04.060 --> 17:08.340
pressure, yet this demonstrates the direction the country, and especially its leader, is

17:08.340 --> 17:09.340
heading.

17:09.340 --> 17:12.940
While it's long been understood that civil rights and freedoms are limited in Rwanda,

17:12.940 --> 17:17.100
proponents of Kagame's argue that they were necessary to take the country from its genocide

17:17.100 --> 17:19.300
to its current era of relative prosperity.

17:19.300 --> 17:24.540
But perhaps because those rights violations are becoming more egregious, that era of prosperity

17:24.540 --> 17:27.260
is looking like it could be coming to an end.

17:27.260 --> 17:31.500
The murder rate has increased to four per 100,000, the average life expectancy has dropped

17:31.500 --> 17:35.780
a year, and both the corruption and political stability percentiles have decreased at least

17:35.780 --> 17:37.380
one percentage point.

17:37.380 --> 17:41.560
But things are looking more promising from an economic perspective—businesses are continuing

17:41.560 --> 17:43.260
to invest in Rwanda.

17:43.260 --> 17:48.180
Most notably, Rwandair entered a partnership with Qatar Airways, which purchased a 49%

17:48.180 --> 17:51.300
minority stake in the state-owned national airline.

17:51.300 --> 17:56.340
Together they've invested in the new Begasara International Airport, a $1.3 billion project

17:56.340 --> 18:00.860
that's under construction and set to handle 7 million passengers and 150 million tons

18:00.900 --> 18:04.820
of cargo each year and act as a regional hub for sub-Saharan Africa.

18:04.820 --> 18:09.540
It's slated for completion in 2026, and to meet that growth, Rwandair is doubling

18:09.540 --> 18:12.600
its fleet from 13 to 26 planes.

18:12.600 --> 18:17.700
Other businesses are taking note—Volkswagen, Motorola Solutions, Andela, and Radisson have

18:17.700 --> 18:19.420
planted flags in Rwanda.

18:19.420 --> 18:24.100
The country continues to shift and craft policy to entice foreign direct investment, and a

18:24.100 --> 18:27.540
2023 US State Department report says that it's quote, easy to launch a business in

18:27.540 --> 18:30.740
Rwanda, but making it profitable can be a challenge.

18:30.740 --> 18:38.920
And yet, the GDP continues to climb, growing 8.2% in 2022, hitting $13.31 billion.

18:38.920 --> 18:43.500
In the fall, Kagame announced he would run for re-election again in 2024, which is only

18:43.500 --> 18:48.000
possible because his government extended term limits in 2015, and so the fate of the country

18:48.000 --> 18:50.420
appears to remain in his hands.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.660
And just as we said four years ago, it'll be up to him and his administration to improve

18:54.660 --> 18:58.980
upon the political climate in order to make foreign direct investment attractive and stable.

18:59.260 --> 19:01.860
It's not yet Singapore, but it's still trying.

19:01.860 --> 19:03.580
Then there's China.

19:03.580 --> 19:08.260
Now, if you're an aspiring educational YouTuber, here's a tip—make videos about China.

19:08.260 --> 19:12.440
It's an interesting, dynamic place that just does numbers.

19:12.440 --> 19:16.340
A lot happens there, and a lot has changed since we started making videos dealing with

19:16.340 --> 19:17.340
the country.

19:17.340 --> 19:18.980
Take, for instance, this one.

19:18.980 --> 19:24.060
It's five years old, it did 9 million views, and while its main points still hold true,

19:24.060 --> 19:27.740
how exactly China is making Africa its own China has shifted.

19:27.740 --> 19:31.680
Now, the video's claim was that much of the continent is economically and politically

19:31.680 --> 19:35.860
aligned with China, simply because China has pumped huge amounts of money into the continent

19:35.860 --> 19:36.980
of Africa.

19:36.980 --> 19:41.760
This much is still true today—China is still Africa's biggest financial supporter, only

19:41.760 --> 19:45.220
pumping more and more foreign direct aid into the continent.

19:45.220 --> 19:48.760
And as to why they're investing, well, that hasn't changed either—it's because of

19:48.760 --> 19:52.860
what comes back in the form of cheaper labor, resources, and goods.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.380
And the form of Chinese investment?

19:54.380 --> 19:58.780
That's pretty much the same too, as most investment comes through large to very large

19:58.780 --> 20:00.060
infrastructure projects.

20:00.060 --> 20:03.500
What's changed has to do with, well, time.

20:03.500 --> 20:07.540
Like every big project, the beginning's usually marked with excitement, but success

20:07.540 --> 20:10.680
ultimately comes down to execution further down the road.

20:10.680 --> 20:14.460
Take this light rail system that the original video identified as an impressive example

20:14.460 --> 20:19.400
of Chinese investment in Ethiopia as it established sub-Saharan Africa's first inner-city tram

20:19.400 --> 20:20.400
in 2015.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.760
Well, now this system's proving difficult to keep running on time while operating costs

20:24.760 --> 20:27.400
continue to crawl higher and higher.

20:27.400 --> 20:32.300
Already by 2018, outside observers had identified that the system had a fundamental electricity

20:32.300 --> 20:35.540
supply issue, which has only gotten worse since.

20:35.540 --> 20:41.840
As of 2020, the system that once ran 41 trains across two lines was now only running 17.

20:41.840 --> 20:46.920
As of 2023, average traffic had dropped to about 50% of the high-water mark, while waits

20:46.920 --> 20:50.360
along the green line had ballooned to 19 minutes.

20:50.360 --> 20:54.040
The problem is, it's hard for Ethiopian officials to keep the system running when

20:54.040 --> 20:57.980
it can't get spare parts easily and lack the institutional knowledge required to fix

20:57.980 --> 21:00.360
the Chinese-manufactured trainset.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.800
This transit system is a microcosm for how Chinese investment in Africa has played out

21:04.800 --> 21:05.800
more broadly.

21:05.800 --> 21:09.920
They break ground on exciting projects that promise to aid African development, but the

21:09.920 --> 21:14.480
projects prove ultimately flawed by a lack of foresight and an over-serving of blind

21:14.480 --> 21:15.480
optimism.

21:15.480 --> 21:19.440
For African countries with newfound experience in the difficulty of the upkeep and follow-through

21:19.440 --> 21:23.440
on these infrastructure projects, some leaders are becoming more cautious of welcoming them

21:23.440 --> 21:28.040
in while, for its part, China, now more wary of the cost of large-scale infrastructure

21:28.040 --> 21:32.220
investment, is beginning to slow its role too, leading to serious belt-tightening on

21:32.220 --> 21:35.080
these projects that have come to comprise the Belt and Road Initiative.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.900
And it's not just the money leaving China that's changing, either.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.920
The nation's robust manufacturing sector that has spearheaded its massive export economy

21:42.920 --> 21:46.760
for decades has started to take a different shape in the last few years.

21:46.760 --> 21:51.800
Chinese manufacturing still wins, but it's winning less, now six years later.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.660
So too has this channel, as six years ago I actually traveled to make this, making my

21:55.660 --> 22:00.640
way to the capital of Chinese technology manufacturing, Shenzhen, in the Guangdong province, so I

22:00.640 --> 22:02.600
went there to see what it was like.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.200
This was the first time I ever traveled for a video, thanks to an invitation by the company

22:06.200 --> 22:07.200
Anchor.

22:07.200 --> 22:10.040
Back then, they were a burgeoning startup that was just celebrating making their way

22:10.040 --> 22:14.080
into Walmart, but today they've grown into a Chinese entrepreneurship success story,

22:14.080 --> 22:16.700
and a company there's a good shot you've heard of.

22:16.700 --> 22:22.560
Shenzhen as a city is really known for two things, one is its manufacturing capabilities,

22:22.560 --> 22:31.500
especially for consumer electronics products, and second is gravitation for talents or human

22:31.500 --> 22:37.680
resources, especially on the product development and research and development disciplines.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.520
Six years on, this is still the case.

22:39.520 --> 22:43.560
Shenzhen is the hardware capital of the world, and still home to some of the biggest tech

22:44.040 --> 22:47.640
manufacturers, but not quite to the level it once was.

22:47.640 --> 22:53.000
Take this motion graphic—Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, Canon—they all manufacture

22:53.000 --> 22:55.680
products here in Shenzhen.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.680
Or they did.

22:56.680 --> 23:01.000
In 2018, Samsung closed its factory in Shenzhen.

23:01.000 --> 23:04.160
More recently, Canon has closed its Zhuhai plant.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.320
As for Microsoft, Sony, and Apple, they remain in the city, but the latter two have minimized

23:08.320 --> 23:12.000
their presence within the country, with Sony moving all its camera-making facilities to

23:12.000 --> 23:13.120
different countries.

23:13.680 --> 23:17.280
Shenzhen is still the dominant power in the tech world, but it's giving up ground, and

23:17.280 --> 23:20.340
that much can be said of Chinese manufacturing overall.

23:20.340 --> 23:25.440
This is manufacturing output from China from 2004 to 2022—it's doing broadly what it

23:25.440 --> 23:29.260
should be doing, going up and to the right with a stagnation during the COVID years.

23:29.260 --> 23:33.760
The thing is, it's shrinking as a percentage of China's GDP—where it sat in the low

23:33.760 --> 23:39.220
30s during the early 2010s, it's now in the mid-to-high 20s in the early 2020s.

23:39.220 --> 23:42.100
This is all because the Chinese economy is changing.

23:42.100 --> 23:45.860
As it makes strides towards middle-income status, China's economy is trending towards

23:45.860 --> 23:50.140
services rather than manufacturing, and as standards of living and wages increase, the

23:50.140 --> 23:53.460
benefits of manufacturing in China are becoming less obvious.

23:53.460 --> 23:57.820
This, along with added geopolitical tensions, has turned some countries towards so-called

23:57.820 --> 24:02.560
China-plus-one strategies, where they maintain a factory foothold in the country, but also

24:02.560 --> 24:07.240
diversify their supply chain with factories in, say, Vietnam, so should a COVID strand

24:07.240 --> 24:11.440
or a spat in the South China Sea turn off supply from Shenzhen, the company can stay

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
afloat.

24:12.440 --> 24:16.160
Or, companies are beginning to outright skip on China's relatively cheap labor for options

24:16.160 --> 24:20.120
close to home, which has to do with lessons learned with COVID shortages mentioned earlier,

24:20.120 --> 24:24.300
as well as the exciting potential of other manufacturing bases, as, once again, we mentioned

24:24.300 --> 24:25.540
in this year's video.

24:25.540 --> 24:29.460
In this case of Mexico, both American and Chinese companies hoping to be nearer to the

24:29.460 --> 24:34.000
US, while still benefiting from less expensive labor, have moved operations to just south

24:34.000 --> 24:35.420
of the American border.

24:35.420 --> 24:39.420
As it factors within China, and outside of China, the nation's manufacturing might

24:39.420 --> 24:45.020
has shown cracks in the last few years, but still, for now, it wins—just by a narrower

24:45.020 --> 24:46.420
margin than before.

24:46.420 --> 24:51.080
Now, if there's a theme throughout these China videos revisited, it's that, broadly,

24:51.080 --> 24:54.780
the way the world interacts with the country has shifted throughout the early years of

24:54.780 --> 24:55.780
this decade.

24:55.780 --> 25:00.500
COVID-19, of course, is a major part of this story, but it's not all of it.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.860
Take this video, Australia's China Problem.

25:02.860 --> 25:06.900
Between it, we make the point that Australia has hitched its wagon to China economically,

25:06.900 --> 25:11.260
putting it in a difficult spot where it doesn't align socially, culturally, or in some cases

25:11.260 --> 25:13.040
morally, with the regional power.

25:13.040 --> 25:16.980
To illustrate the economic tethering between the two nations, we highlighted higher education

25:16.980 --> 25:21.020
and raw minerals as two sectors where Australia's come to lean on China.

25:21.020 --> 25:25.220
Well, now Australia has begun to work towards addressing its dangerous reliance on trade

25:25.220 --> 25:28.460
with China, and it's doing so within those sectors.

25:28.460 --> 25:32.020
This is a graph of Chinese students enrolled in Australian higher education.

25:32.020 --> 25:36.380
Now, obviously, the initial decline can be attributed to COVID-19, but in the last two

25:36.380 --> 25:41.540
years the numbers have remained lower even as restrictions have eased, largely on account

25:41.540 --> 25:44.500
of an increasingly strained relationship between the two countries.

25:44.500 --> 25:48.700
Since 2020, the two countries have been going back and forth—China slapped heavy-handed

25:48.700 --> 25:52.700
tariffs on Australian goods from wine and wheat to coal and cotton, while Australia

25:52.700 --> 25:56.720
has called for a critical inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 and expressed concerns

25:56.720 --> 26:01.340
over Chinese behavior in the Pacific, aligning itself closer with the US and the West.

26:01.340 --> 26:05.580
Surprisingly, though, by taking increasingly louder stances against China, and then being

26:05.580 --> 26:10.380
frozen out as retribution, Australian exports haven't plummeted, minimizing the economic

26:10.380 --> 26:12.900
damage that the countries had to ride out.

26:12.900 --> 26:17.700
As overall exports from Australia show, not only has it bounced back from COVID and Chinese

26:17.700 --> 26:20.040
tariffs, the sector's as strong as it's ever been.

26:20.040 --> 26:24.100
While diplomatic tensions have begun to cool across 2023, Australia has actually found

26:24.100 --> 26:28.480
itself with more leverage than any point prior in its relationship with China.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.500
If China freezes out Australian coal again, for instance, they can simply sell to countries

26:32.500 --> 26:37.160
like India, Japan, and South Korea that are bound to be left high and dry when China's

26:37.160 --> 26:39.700
supply chain shifts.

26:39.700 --> 26:44.160
With 2023 coming to a close, many of you are likely thinking about making some charitable

26:44.160 --> 26:47.800
donations—after all, it's both the season of giving and the last couple of days when

26:47.800 --> 26:51.420
tax-deductible donations can reduce your 2023 tax burden.

26:51.420 --> 26:55.000
With whatever you're able to give, I'm sure you want to be sure that it's as impactful

26:55.000 --> 26:58.780
and influential as possible, but that's a pretty daunting process when essentially

26:58.780 --> 27:03.160
every nonprofit has a compelling argument as to why they're a worthy cause.

27:03.160 --> 27:05.760
Now, you probably already know the solution to this.

27:05.760 --> 27:10.000
When you buy, say, a new mattress, you don't just listen to what the various mattress companies

27:10.000 --> 27:13.900
say, because of course they're all going to say that they're the best.

27:13.900 --> 27:18.400
You look for independent third-party reviews, as that's a far more trustworthy source.

27:18.400 --> 27:23.340
Well, our sponsor, GiveWell, is essentially that independent third-party review source,

27:23.340 --> 27:24.340
but for nonprofits.

27:24.680 --> 27:29.460
They've spent over 15 years researching charitable organizations and only direct funding

27:29.460 --> 27:32.740
to a few of the highest-impact opportunities they've found.

27:32.740 --> 27:36.700
In fact, people have donated over a billion dollars based on the recommendations they

27:36.700 --> 27:40.760
provide since they make it easy—you get all of their research for free and can make

27:40.760 --> 27:44.320
donations right from their site, and they don't take any cut—with the exception

27:44.320 --> 27:47.760
of processing fees, all the money goes to the nonprofit.

27:47.760 --> 27:51.980
Rigorous evidence suggests that over 150,000 lives have been saved through the donations

27:51.980 --> 27:56.800
GiveWell has directed, as relatively small amounts can have a major impact when used

27:56.800 --> 27:57.800
well.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.600
Just one dollar, for example, can distribute a vitamin A supplement in an area where vitamin

28:01.600 --> 28:04.420
A deficiency may increase mortality rates.

28:04.420 --> 28:08.360
And even with GiveWell's already higher impact, you can double yours since, if you've

28:08.360 --> 28:12.360
never donated with them before, they'll match what you contribute up to $100 if you

28:12.360 --> 28:16.060
go to GiveWell.org, pick YouTube, then Wendover as the show.

28:16.060 --> 28:19.400
So thanks in advance for the help you'll provide, and happy holidays.
