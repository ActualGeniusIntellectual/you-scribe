This video was made possible by Shopify—the platform behind Wendover and hundreds of thousands

00:04.920 --> 00:07.240
of other online stores.

00:07.240 --> 00:12.280
The last five years have been the most consistently profitable and financially successful years

00:12.280 --> 00:15.240
ever for the world's commercial airlines.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.880
Including the 2019 forecast, they've earned more than $160 billion in combined profit

00:20.880 --> 00:22.200
over this period.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.340
With a world economy more robust and connected than ever, the aviation industry is flying

00:27.340 --> 00:30.060
high—or at least most of it.

00:30.060 --> 00:34.700
In these same five years, the world has seen some extremely high-profile airline collapses

00:34.700 --> 00:38.220
and the frequency of these seems to only be picking up.

00:38.220 --> 00:43.300
The trend truly began in 2017 when Monarch, a well-respected British leisure airline with

00:43.300 --> 00:45.660
50 years of history, went belly up.

00:45.660 --> 00:51.380
The very same month, Air Berlin, a massive airline with over 8,000 employees and 100

00:51.380 --> 00:53.700
planes, also ceased operations.

00:53.700 --> 00:58.360
2018 then saw the end of Primera Air, an airline that generated buzz but seemingly

00:58.360 --> 01:02.900
flew too close to the sun in its final days with its low-cost transatlantic flights and

01:02.900 --> 01:05.260
Cobalt Air, a small chip-riot carrier.

01:05.260 --> 01:08.260
2019, though, was the year of slaughter.

01:08.260 --> 01:12.900
Wow Air, a huge player in the low-cost transatlantic market, stopped flying.

01:12.900 --> 01:16.740
Herge-Azur, France's second largest airline, stopped flying.

01:16.740 --> 01:21.260
XL Airways France, a long-existing transatlantic airline, stopped flying.

01:21.300 --> 01:25.020
Adria Airways, a mid-sized Slovenian airline, stopped flying.

01:25.020 --> 01:30.140
Then, after 50 years of history, Thomas Cook Airlines suddenly too stopped flying and would

01:30.140 --> 01:34.860
enter the record books as the largest UK airline collapse ever.

01:34.860 --> 01:38.620
Worth noting is that the aforementioned airlines are not cherry-picked names.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.700
It's certainly not the definitive list of airline collapses in the past three years,

01:42.700 --> 01:47.180
but they are most all the highest-profile ones and with these, there are two interesting

01:47.180 --> 01:48.180
patterns.

01:48.180 --> 01:51.620
Firstly, every single one of these airlines is based in Europe.

01:51.620 --> 01:55.980
Secondly, and perhaps more strangely, every single one of these airlines, with the exception

01:55.980 --> 02:01.120
of Wow Air, stopped flying in either the month of September or October.

02:01.120 --> 02:05.280
Neither the pattern in location or times of these collapses is a coincidence.

02:05.280 --> 02:08.220
There are very good reasons behind these trends.

02:08.220 --> 02:13.860
For the timing, you see, in general airlines' most profitable season by far is summer since

02:13.860 --> 02:15.620
that's when there's the most demand.

02:15.620 --> 02:18.040
There are certainly exceptions to this rule.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.720
For example, an airline flying between the northern and southern hemisphere a substantial

02:21.720 --> 02:26.220
amount, like Qantas, typically sees more consistent month-to-month profits as it benefits from

02:26.220 --> 02:29.400
the demand in both the northern and southern summer.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.840
The seasonality of demand also varies significantly by region.

02:32.840 --> 02:37.820
For example, here are a few years of overall month-to-month passenger figures in the US.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.320
You can see there's a clear peak each August and a clear valley each February, with smaller

02:42.320 --> 02:45.640
secondary peaks each year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.480
If you take a look at Europe's month-to-month figures, though, you can see how relatively

02:49.480 --> 02:52.320
stable the US's traffic is.

02:52.320 --> 02:56.560
Relying much more on leisure demand, which is highly seasonal, European airlines have

02:56.560 --> 03:00.860
to cope with winter demand being almost half that of summer demand.

03:00.860 --> 03:04.580
Airlines in the US, though, carry more business travelers in proportion, who tend to book

03:04.580 --> 03:07.900
more consistently throughout the year, and therefore they don't have as much excess

03:07.900 --> 03:09.580
capacity in the winter.

03:09.580 --> 03:13.880
There are even regions like Asia-Pacific that see nearly no seasonality in their demand,

03:13.880 --> 03:17.840
but the main thing to know is that Europe has highly seasonal traffic which means the

03:17.840 --> 03:21.760
timing of when its airlines make their money is highly seasonal.

03:21.760 --> 03:26.080
For example, take a look at Ryanair's quarterly gross profit graph.

03:26.080 --> 03:32.160
In 2018, they made $901 million from January to March, $1.4 billion from April to June,

03:32.160 --> 03:35.660
then an enormous $2.1 billion from July to September.

03:35.660 --> 03:40.880
The fall was then definitively their weakest quarter with only $877 million made.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.900
Essentially, they made three quarters of their profits in half the year.

03:44.900 --> 03:48.120
The problem airlines then have, though, is cash flow.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.640
For the busy summer season, airlines will get paid for tickets in the months leading

03:51.640 --> 03:56.380
up to those flights—therefore, most of the money for that season will get to them between

03:56.380 --> 03:57.600
March and August.

03:57.600 --> 04:02.360
It's therefore a season that can typically sustain even the financially weakest airlines.

04:02.360 --> 04:07.720
Come September, though, bookings start to dry up and therefore so does cash flow.

04:07.720 --> 04:11.320
With that, airlines will start to struggle to pay off their debts, let alone the cost

04:11.320 --> 04:13.820
for fuel and other operating expenses.

04:13.820 --> 04:18.400
Once an airline starts to fall behind on their debts, it tends to be a vicious cycle.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.260
Quickly, they might have planes repossessed, which means they have to cancel flights, which

04:22.260 --> 04:26.680
means they have to pay for hotels and penalties and for rebooking and pretty soon, the airline

04:26.680 --> 04:30.380
won't have enough money to operate and will be declared bankrupt.

04:30.380 --> 04:34.200
In Europe, unlike the US, there is little opportunity for business to restructure when

04:34.200 --> 04:38.920
it's bankrupt so, for the most part, that means they're closed down immediately and

04:38.920 --> 04:40.620
indefinitely.

04:40.620 --> 04:45.580
As the aviation industry is so volatile and capital intense, these bankruptcies can happen

04:45.580 --> 04:47.400
impressively fast.

04:47.400 --> 04:50.920
In Thomas Cook's case, there had been hints of its financial difficulties for months,

04:50.920 --> 04:55.500
but at the end of August, it seemed the company would likely be saved by a buyout deal.

04:55.500 --> 04:59.320
It only truly became clear that the airline was headed towards its end the very week of

04:59.320 --> 05:04.200
its collapse, but still, everything went on as normal from an operational standpoint.

05:04.200 --> 05:09.360
On September 22nd, at 9.40 pm, the airline tweeted in response to a customer saying,

05:09.360 --> 05:12.820
our flights and holiday operations are operating as normal.

05:12.820 --> 05:14.940
That was true, at the time.

05:14.940 --> 05:19.240
All the flights were taking off, they were still selling tickets, everything was normal

05:19.240 --> 05:21.120
from the public perspective.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.980
Behind closed doors, though, things were not okay.

05:23.980 --> 05:28.400
Five and a half hours later, in the early hours of the morning of September 23rd, the

05:28.400 --> 05:32.120
company's last tweet went out saying, we are sorry to announce that Thomas Cook has

05:32.120 --> 05:34.440
ceased trading with immediate effect.

05:34.440 --> 05:38.720
All around the world, at the very moment of their declaration of insolvency, flights were

05:38.720 --> 05:43.780
quite literally boarding, crews on board, planes fueled, ready to go.

05:43.780 --> 05:47.360
With the company now gone, though, everything had to stop.

05:47.360 --> 05:51.120
Those crews were no longer employed, that fuel wouldn't be paid for, the planes were

05:51.120 --> 05:55.160
no longer owned or leased by the airline, everything stopped.

05:55.160 --> 05:59.280
Of course, once an airline collapses and its flights are cancelled, there is no longer

05:59.280 --> 06:02.520
an airline to re-book passengers onto other flights.

06:02.520 --> 06:07.160
In most cases, passengers are just out of luck, but in the case of the UK, their civil

06:07.160 --> 06:11.440
aviation authority essentially takes the place of any UK airline for the weeks following

06:11.440 --> 06:12.600
its collapse.

06:12.600 --> 06:17.060
The CAA will either re-book passengers onto another airline or just actually run their

06:17.060 --> 06:18.240
own flights.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.480
Of course, the CAA doesn't have their own fleet of planes.

06:21.680 --> 06:26.240
Rather, they have a number of airlines around the world essentially on retainer for any

06:26.240 --> 06:29.080
time they need to run repatriation flights.

06:29.080 --> 06:34.820
This includes plenty of charter operators like HiFly, Atlas Global, Wamos Air, and more,

06:34.820 --> 06:40.680
but perhaps the most unique aircraft used by the CAA was a Malaysian Airlines A380.

06:40.680 --> 06:45.140
The airline dedicates some of its A380s to charter operations and so, the day before

06:45.140 --> 06:50.200
Thomas Cook's collapse, when it became clear that the end was nigh, the A380 flew empty

06:50.200 --> 06:52.920
all the way from Kuala Lumpur to Manchester.

06:52.920 --> 06:57.760
It landed a couple minutes past midnight on September 23rd, just a few short hours before

06:57.760 --> 07:00.880
Thomas Cook was officially declared insolvent.

07:00.880 --> 07:05.620
As this and plenty of other aircraft pre-positioned, even while Thomas Cook flew its last flights,

07:05.620 --> 07:10.980
the CAA was able to start flying its repatriation flights the same day and many passengers were

07:10.980 --> 07:15.040
only a few hours delayed even after their airline went belly up.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.560
The Malaysian A380 was assigned to fly flights from Palma to Mallorca, but part of the difficulty

07:19.560 --> 07:24.420
was that, from Palma, Thomas Cook had flown an enormous quantity of flights to an enormous

07:24.420 --> 07:29.080
number of destinations in the UK—London, Cardiff, Birmingham, East Midlands, Manchester,

07:29.080 --> 07:31.100
Newcastle, Glasgow, and Belfast.

07:31.100 --> 07:35.180
Of course, it's much more complicated to find eight small planes than just one large

07:35.180 --> 07:39.900
plane, so that's what they did—they found the largest passenger plane in the world.

07:39.900 --> 07:44.680
Every flight the A380 flew ran just the two hours from Palma to Manchester and then from

07:44.680 --> 07:49.500
Manchester, buses ran to Glasgow, Newcastle, East Midlands, Birmingham, and London.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.160
Using this system, with just one aircraft, the CAA was able to run up to three flights

07:54.160 --> 07:59.680
a day from Palma to the UK with capacity for nearly 1,500 passengers—the equivalent to

07:59.680 --> 08:02.520
almost seven Thomas Cook A321s.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.180
This whole process went on for weeks, making for a lucrative payday for the world's charter

08:06.180 --> 08:10.380
companies and an expensive bill for the UK government, but it certainly is easier than

08:10.380 --> 08:14.120
having hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded worldwide.

08:14.120 --> 08:17.840
Having a record-breaking airline collapse and then another record-breaking airline collapse

08:17.840 --> 08:23.100
in the span of two years is certainly not normal and it's certainly not a coincidence.

08:23.100 --> 08:27.660
Part of the problem is that the airline industry has been so robust in the past decade that

08:27.660 --> 08:30.360
it has allowed weaker airlines to survive.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.620
Out of the bankrupted airlines mentioned at the start—Monarch, Air Berlin, Premier Air,

08:34.620 --> 08:40.020
Cobalt Air, Wow Air, Air Glazer, XL Airways France, Adria Airlines, and Thomas Cook—five

08:40.020 --> 08:43.560
were focused on long-haul, low-cost flying.

08:43.560 --> 08:47.860
This business model is a rather new phenomenon made possible, at least on paper, by smaller

08:47.860 --> 08:53.700
fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft and low fuel costs but, outside of Asia and Australia,

08:53.700 --> 08:58.020
no airline has really achieved sustained profitability with this model.

08:58.020 --> 09:02.840
AirAsia X, Scoot, and Jetstar are really the only airlines worldwide that have seen long-term

09:02.840 --> 09:05.940
financial success flying long-haul, low-cost.

09:05.940 --> 09:10.720
After fuel prices plummeted in 2014, these airlines entered a period of rapid expansion

09:10.720 --> 09:15.860
as they were able to undercut the incumbents' prices significantly but then, in 2017, fuel

09:15.860 --> 09:20.340
prices started ticking back up and these airlines had a tough choice—they could either raise

09:20.340 --> 09:24.460
prices and lose some of the market share they had built up or keep prices the same and grow

09:24.460 --> 09:26.740
further away from profitability.

09:26.740 --> 09:31.740
Many chose the latter and, as fuel prices continued to rise, the companies began to

09:31.740 --> 09:32.740
fall.

09:32.740 --> 09:36.660
Many analysts have also suggested that another contributing factor to this spate of airline

09:36.660 --> 09:39.000
collapses is overcapacity.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.920
Somewhat as a result of how successful and profitable the industry has been over the

09:42.920 --> 09:47.440
past decade, airlines have been buying planes like crazy and investors have been funding

09:47.440 --> 09:49.000
airlines like crazy.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.760
For a while, the rule has been that adding more capacity means more profits, however,

09:53.760 --> 09:57.040
the industry has likely found a ceiling to that rule.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.680
This is especially true in Europe's market, where buying an additional plane that you

10:00.680 --> 10:04.200
might be able to fill in the summer means paying for it throughout the long winter too

10:04.200 --> 10:05.440
when it might sit empty.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.700
What's for sure, though, is that Thomas Cook will not be the last to fall.

10:09.700 --> 10:13.860
It is only getting tougher to survive as an airline, especially in Europe, and each year,

10:13.860 --> 10:19.480
without fail, another big name too will topple in September or October—the latest victim

10:19.480 --> 10:24.580
in the world's annual airline culling season.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.820
One of the ways that Wendover Productions functions as a business, and stays out of

10:27.820 --> 10:30.700
bankruptcy of course, is through merchandise sales.

10:30.700 --> 10:34.980
We sell a few types of t-shirts for both Wendover and Half as Interesting, which is a nice,

10:35.020 --> 10:37.440
predictable income source that we control.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.360
Creating an online store at first seemed daunting, but then we came across Shopify.

10:42.360 --> 10:47.120
