7240	12280	The last five years have been the most consistently profitable and financially successful years
12280	15240	ever for the world's commercial airlines.
15240	20880	Including the 2019 forecast, they've earned more than $160 billion in combined profit
20880	22200	over this period.
22200	27340	With a world economy more robust and connected than ever, the aviation industry is flying
27340	30060	high—or at least most of it.
30060	34700	In these same five years, the world has seen some extremely high-profile airline collapses
34700	38220	and the frequency of these seems to only be picking up.
38220	43300	The trend truly began in 2017 when Monarch, a well-respected British leisure airline with
43300	45660	50 years of history, went belly up.
45660	51380	The very same month, Air Berlin, a massive airline with over 8,000 employees and 100
51380	53700	planes, also ceased operations.
53700	58360	2018 then saw the end of Primera Air, an airline that generated buzz but seemingly
58360	62900	flew too close to the sun in its final days with its low-cost transatlantic flights and
62900	65260	Cobalt Air, a small chip-riot carrier.
65260	68260	2019, though, was the year of slaughter.
68260	72900	Wow Air, a huge player in the low-cost transatlantic market, stopped flying.
72900	76740	Herge-Azur, France's second largest airline, stopped flying.
76740	81260	XL Airways France, a long-existing transatlantic airline, stopped flying.
81300	85020	Adria Airways, a mid-sized Slovenian airline, stopped flying.
85020	90140	Then, after 50 years of history, Thomas Cook Airlines suddenly too stopped flying and would
90140	94860	enter the record books as the largest UK airline collapse ever.
94860	98620	Worth noting is that the aforementioned airlines are not cherry-picked names.
98620	102700	It's certainly not the definitive list of airline collapses in the past three years,
102700	107180	but they are most all the highest-profile ones and with these, there are two interesting
107180	108180	patterns.
108180	111620	Firstly, every single one of these airlines is based in Europe.
111620	115980	Secondly, and perhaps more strangely, every single one of these airlines, with the exception
115980	121120	of Wow Air, stopped flying in either the month of September or October.
121120	125280	Neither the pattern in location or times of these collapses is a coincidence.
125280	128220	There are very good reasons behind these trends.
128220	133860	For the timing, you see, in general airlines' most profitable season by far is summer since
133860	135620	that's when there's the most demand.
135620	138040	There are certainly exceptions to this rule.
138040	141720	For example, an airline flying between the northern and southern hemisphere a substantial
141720	146220	amount, like Qantas, typically sees more consistent month-to-month profits as it benefits from
146220	149400	the demand in both the northern and southern summer.
149400	152840	The seasonality of demand also varies significantly by region.
152840	157820	For example, here are a few years of overall month-to-month passenger figures in the US.
157820	162320	You can see there's a clear peak each August and a clear valley each February, with smaller
162320	165640	secondary peaks each year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
165640	169480	If you take a look at Europe's month-to-month figures, though, you can see how relatively
169480	172320	stable the US's traffic is.
172320	176560	Relying much more on leisure demand, which is highly seasonal, European airlines have
176560	180860	to cope with winter demand being almost half that of summer demand.
180860	184580	Airlines in the US, though, carry more business travelers in proportion, who tend to book
184580	187900	more consistently throughout the year, and therefore they don't have as much excess
187900	189580	capacity in the winter.
189580	193880	There are even regions like Asia-Pacific that see nearly no seasonality in their demand,
193880	197840	but the main thing to know is that Europe has highly seasonal traffic which means the
197840	201760	timing of when its airlines make their money is highly seasonal.
201760	206080	For example, take a look at Ryanair's quarterly gross profit graph.
206080	212160	In 2018, they made $901 million from January to March, $1.4 billion from April to June,
212160	215660	then an enormous $2.1 billion from July to September.
215660	220880	The fall was then definitively their weakest quarter with only $877 million made.
220880	224900	Essentially, they made three quarters of their profits in half the year.
224900	228120	The problem airlines then have, though, is cash flow.
228120	231640	For the busy summer season, airlines will get paid for tickets in the months leading
231640	236380	up to those flights—therefore, most of the money for that season will get to them between
236380	237600	March and August.
237600	242360	It's therefore a season that can typically sustain even the financially weakest airlines.
242360	247720	Come September, though, bookings start to dry up and therefore so does cash flow.
247720	251320	With that, airlines will start to struggle to pay off their debts, let alone the cost
251320	253820	for fuel and other operating expenses.
253820	258400	Once an airline starts to fall behind on their debts, it tends to be a vicious cycle.
258400	262260	Quickly, they might have planes repossessed, which means they have to cancel flights, which
262260	266680	means they have to pay for hotels and penalties and for rebooking and pretty soon, the airline
266680	270380	won't have enough money to operate and will be declared bankrupt.
270380	274200	In Europe, unlike the US, there is little opportunity for business to restructure when
274200	278920	it's bankrupt so, for the most part, that means they're closed down immediately and
278920	280620	indefinitely.
280620	285580	As the aviation industry is so volatile and capital intense, these bankruptcies can happen
285580	287400	impressively fast.
287400	290920	In Thomas Cook's case, there had been hints of its financial difficulties for months,
290920	295500	but at the end of August, it seemed the company would likely be saved by a buyout deal.
295500	299320	It only truly became clear that the airline was headed towards its end the very week of
299320	304200	its collapse, but still, everything went on as normal from an operational standpoint.
304200	309360	On September 22nd, at 9.40 pm, the airline tweeted in response to a customer saying,
309360	312820	our flights and holiday operations are operating as normal.
312820	314940	That was true, at the time.
314940	319240	All the flights were taking off, they were still selling tickets, everything was normal
319240	321120	from the public perspective.
321120	323980	Behind closed doors, though, things were not okay.
323980	328400	Five and a half hours later, in the early hours of the morning of September 23rd, the
328400	332120	company's last tweet went out saying, we are sorry to announce that Thomas Cook has
332120	334440	ceased trading with immediate effect.
334440	338720	All around the world, at the very moment of their declaration of insolvency, flights were
338720	343780	quite literally boarding, crews on board, planes fueled, ready to go.
343780	347360	With the company now gone, though, everything had to stop.
347360	351120	Those crews were no longer employed, that fuel wouldn't be paid for, the planes were
351120	355160	no longer owned or leased by the airline, everything stopped.
355160	359280	Of course, once an airline collapses and its flights are cancelled, there is no longer
359280	362520	an airline to re-book passengers onto other flights.
362520	367160	In most cases, passengers are just out of luck, but in the case of the UK, their civil
367160	371440	aviation authority essentially takes the place of any UK airline for the weeks following
371440	372600	its collapse.
372600	377060	The CAA will either re-book passengers onto another airline or just actually run their
377060	378240	own flights.
378240	381480	Of course, the CAA doesn't have their own fleet of planes.
381680	386240	Rather, they have a number of airlines around the world essentially on retainer for any
386240	389080	time they need to run repatriation flights.
389080	394820	This includes plenty of charter operators like HiFly, Atlas Global, Wamos Air, and more,
394820	400680	but perhaps the most unique aircraft used by the CAA was a Malaysian Airlines A380.
400680	405140	The airline dedicates some of its A380s to charter operations and so, the day before
405140	410200	Thomas Cook's collapse, when it became clear that the end was nigh, the A380 flew empty
410200	412920	all the way from Kuala Lumpur to Manchester.
412920	417760	It landed a couple minutes past midnight on September 23rd, just a few short hours before
417760	420880	Thomas Cook was officially declared insolvent.
420880	425620	As this and plenty of other aircraft pre-positioned, even while Thomas Cook flew its last flights,
425620	430980	the CAA was able to start flying its repatriation flights the same day and many passengers were
430980	435040	only a few hours delayed even after their airline went belly up.
435040	439560	The Malaysian A380 was assigned to fly flights from Palma to Mallorca, but part of the difficulty
439560	444420	was that, from Palma, Thomas Cook had flown an enormous quantity of flights to an enormous
444420	449080	number of destinations in the UK—London, Cardiff, Birmingham, East Midlands, Manchester,
449080	451100	Newcastle, Glasgow, and Belfast.
451100	455180	Of course, it's much more complicated to find eight small planes than just one large
455180	459900	plane, so that's what they did—they found the largest passenger plane in the world.
459900	464680	Every flight the A380 flew ran just the two hours from Palma to Manchester and then from
464680	469500	Manchester, buses ran to Glasgow, Newcastle, East Midlands, Birmingham, and London.
469500	474160	Using this system, with just one aircraft, the CAA was able to run up to three flights
474160	479680	a day from Palma to the UK with capacity for nearly 1,500 passengers—the equivalent to
479680	482520	almost seven Thomas Cook A321s.
482520	486180	This whole process went on for weeks, making for a lucrative payday for the world's charter
486180	490380	companies and an expensive bill for the UK government, but it certainly is easier than
490380	494120	having hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded worldwide.
494120	497840	Having a record-breaking airline collapse and then another record-breaking airline collapse
497840	503100	in the span of two years is certainly not normal and it's certainly not a coincidence.
503100	507660	Part of the problem is that the airline industry has been so robust in the past decade that
507660	510360	it has allowed weaker airlines to survive.
510360	514620	Out of the bankrupted airlines mentioned at the start—Monarch, Air Berlin, Premier Air,
514620	520020	Cobalt Air, Wow Air, Air Glazer, XL Airways France, Adria Airlines, and Thomas Cook—five
520020	523560	were focused on long-haul, low-cost flying.
523560	527860	This business model is a rather new phenomenon made possible, at least on paper, by smaller
527860	533700	fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft and low fuel costs but, outside of Asia and Australia,
533700	538020	no airline has really achieved sustained profitability with this model.
538020	542840	AirAsia X, Scoot, and Jetstar are really the only airlines worldwide that have seen long-term
542840	545940	financial success flying long-haul, low-cost.
545940	550720	After fuel prices plummeted in 2014, these airlines entered a period of rapid expansion
550720	555860	as they were able to undercut the incumbents' prices significantly but then, in 2017, fuel
555860	560340	prices started ticking back up and these airlines had a tough choice—they could either raise
560340	564460	prices and lose some of the market share they had built up or keep prices the same and grow
564460	566740	further away from profitability.
566740	571740	Many chose the latter and, as fuel prices continued to rise, the companies began to
571740	572740	fall.
572740	576660	Many analysts have also suggested that another contributing factor to this spate of airline
576660	579000	collapses is overcapacity.
579000	582920	Somewhat as a result of how successful and profitable the industry has been over the
582920	587440	past decade, airlines have been buying planes like crazy and investors have been funding
587440	589000	airlines like crazy.
589000	593760	For a while, the rule has been that adding more capacity means more profits, however,
593760	597040	the industry has likely found a ceiling to that rule.
597040	600680	This is especially true in Europe's market, where buying an additional plane that you
600680	604200	might be able to fill in the summer means paying for it throughout the long winter too
604200	605440	when it might sit empty.
605440	609700	What's for sure, though, is that Thomas Cook will not be the last to fall.
609700	613860	It is only getting tougher to survive as an airline, especially in Europe, and each year,
613860	619480	without fail, another big name too will topple in September or October—the latest victim
619480	624580	in the world's annual airline culling season.
624580	627820	One of the ways that Wendover Productions functions as a business, and stays out of
627820	630700	bankruptcy of course, is through merchandise sales.

635020	637440	predictable income source that we control.
637440	642360	Creating an online store at first seemed daunting, but then we came across Shopify.
