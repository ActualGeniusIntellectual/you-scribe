of other online stores.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,280
The last five years have been the most consistently profitable and financially successful years

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,240
ever for the world's commercial airlines.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,880
Including the 2019 forecast, they've earned more than $160 billion in combined profit

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,200
over this period.

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,340
With a world economy more robust and connected than ever, the aviation industry is flying

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,060
high—or at least most of it.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,700
In these same five years, the world has seen some extremely high-profile airline collapses

10
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,220
and the frequency of these seems to only be picking up.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:43,300
The trend truly began in 2017 when Monarch, a well-respected British leisure airline with

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,660
50 years of history, went belly up.

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,380
The very same month, Air Berlin, a massive airline with over 8,000 employees and 100

14
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,700
planes, also ceased operations.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,360
2018 then saw the end of Primera Air, an airline that generated buzz but seemingly

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,900
flew too close to the sun in its final days with its low-cost transatlantic flights and

17
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,260
Cobalt Air, a small chip-riot carrier.

18
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,260
2019, though, was the year of slaughter.

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,900
Wow Air, a huge player in the low-cost transatlantic market, stopped flying.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,740
Herge-Azur, France's second largest airline, stopped flying.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,260
XL Airways France, a long-existing transatlantic airline, stopped flying.

22
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,020
Adria Airways, a mid-sized Slovenian airline, stopped flying.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,140
Then, after 50 years of history, Thomas Cook Airlines suddenly too stopped flying and would

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:34,860
enter the record books as the largest UK airline collapse ever.

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,620
Worth noting is that the aforementioned airlines are not cherry-picked names.

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,700
It's certainly not the definitive list of airline collapses in the past three years,

27
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,180
but they are most all the highest-profile ones and with these, there are two interesting

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,180
patterns.

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,620
Firstly, every single one of these airlines is based in Europe.

30
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,980
Secondly, and perhaps more strangely, every single one of these airlines, with the exception

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:02:01,120
of Wow Air, stopped flying in either the month of September or October.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,280
Neither the pattern in location or times of these collapses is a coincidence.

33
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,220
There are very good reasons behind these trends.

34
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,860
For the timing, you see, in general airlines' most profitable season by far is summer since

35
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,620
that's when there's the most demand.

36
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:18,040
There are certainly exceptions to this rule.

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,720
For example, an airline flying between the northern and southern hemisphere a substantial

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,220
amount, like Qantas, typically sees more consistent month-to-month profits as it benefits from

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,400
the demand in both the northern and southern summer.

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,840
The seasonality of demand also varies significantly by region.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,820
For example, here are a few years of overall month-to-month passenger figures in the US.

42
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,320
You can see there's a clear peak each August and a clear valley each February, with smaller

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,640
secondary peaks each year for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,480
If you take a look at Europe's month-to-month figures, though, you can see how relatively

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,320
stable the US's traffic is.

46
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,560
Relying much more on leisure demand, which is highly seasonal, European airlines have

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,860
to cope with winter demand being almost half that of summer demand.

48
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,580
Airlines in the US, though, carry more business travelers in proportion, who tend to book

49
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,900
more consistently throughout the year, and therefore they don't have as much excess

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,580
capacity in the winter.

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,880
There are even regions like Asia-Pacific that see nearly no seasonality in their demand,

52
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,840
but the main thing to know is that Europe has highly seasonal traffic which means the

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,760
timing of when its airlines make their money is highly seasonal.

54
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,080
For example, take a look at Ryanair's quarterly gross profit graph.

55
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,160
In 2018, they made $901 million from January to March, $1.4 billion from April to June,

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,660
then an enormous $2.1 billion from July to September.

57
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,880
The fall was then definitively their weakest quarter with only $877 million made.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,900
Essentially, they made three quarters of their profits in half the year.

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,120
The problem airlines then have, though, is cash flow.

60
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,640
For the busy summer season, airlines will get paid for tickets in the months leading

61
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:56,380
up to those flights—therefore, most of the money for that season will get to them between

62
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,600
March and August.

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,360
It's therefore a season that can typically sustain even the financially weakest airlines.

64
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,720
Come September, though, bookings start to dry up and therefore so does cash flow.

65
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,320
With that, airlines will start to struggle to pay off their debts, let alone the cost

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,820
for fuel and other operating expenses.

67
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,400
Once an airline starts to fall behind on their debts, it tends to be a vicious cycle.

68
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,260
Quickly, they might have planes repossessed, which means they have to cancel flights, which

69
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,680
means they have to pay for hotels and penalties and for rebooking and pretty soon, the airline

70
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,380
won't have enough money to operate and will be declared bankrupt.

71
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,200
In Europe, unlike the US, there is little opportunity for business to restructure when

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,920
it's bankrupt so, for the most part, that means they're closed down immediately and

73
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,620
indefinitely.

74
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,580
As the aviation industry is so volatile and capital intense, these bankruptcies can happen

75
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,400
impressively fast.

76
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,920
In Thomas Cook's case, there had been hints of its financial difficulties for months,

77
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,500
but at the end of August, it seemed the company would likely be saved by a buyout deal.

78
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,320
It only truly became clear that the airline was headed towards its end the very week of

79
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,200
its collapse, but still, everything went on as normal from an operational standpoint.

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:09,360
On September 22nd, at 9.40 pm, the airline tweeted in response to a customer saying,

81
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,820
our flights and holiday operations are operating as normal.

82
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,940
That was true, at the time.

83
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,240
All the flights were taking off, they were still selling tickets, everything was normal

84
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,120
from the public perspective.

85
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,980
Behind closed doors, though, things were not okay.

86
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,400
Five and a half hours later, in the early hours of the morning of September 23rd, the

87
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,120
company's last tweet went out saying, we are sorry to announce that Thomas Cook has

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,440
ceased trading with immediate effect.

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,720
All around the world, at the very moment of their declaration of insolvency, flights were

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,780
quite literally boarding, crews on board, planes fueled, ready to go.

91
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,360
With the company now gone, though, everything had to stop.

92
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,120
Those crews were no longer employed, that fuel wouldn't be paid for, the planes were

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,160
no longer owned or leased by the airline, everything stopped.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,280
Of course, once an airline collapses and its flights are cancelled, there is no longer

95
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,520
an airline to re-book passengers onto other flights.

96
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,160
In most cases, passengers are just out of luck, but in the case of the UK, their civil

97
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,440
aviation authority essentially takes the place of any UK airline for the weeks following

98
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,600
its collapse.

99
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,060
The CAA will either re-book passengers onto another airline or just actually run their

100
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,240
own flights.

101
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,480
Of course, the CAA doesn't have their own fleet of planes.

102
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,240
Rather, they have a number of airlines around the world essentially on retainer for any

103
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,080
time they need to run repatriation flights.

104
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,820
This includes plenty of charter operators like HiFly, Atlas Global, Wamos Air, and more,

105
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,680
but perhaps the most unique aircraft used by the CAA was a Malaysian Airlines A380.

106
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,140
The airline dedicates some of its A380s to charter operations and so, the day before

107
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,200
Thomas Cook's collapse, when it became clear that the end was nigh, the A380 flew empty

108
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,920
all the way from Kuala Lumpur to Manchester.

109
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:57,760
It landed a couple minutes past midnight on September 23rd, just a few short hours before

110
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:00,880
Thomas Cook was officially declared insolvent.

111
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,620
As this and plenty of other aircraft pre-positioned, even while Thomas Cook flew its last flights,

112
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,980
the CAA was able to start flying its repatriation flights the same day and many passengers were

113
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,040
only a few hours delayed even after their airline went belly up.

114
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,560
The Malaysian A380 was assigned to fly flights from Palma to Mallorca, but part of the difficulty

115
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,420
was that, from Palma, Thomas Cook had flown an enormous quantity of flights to an enormous

116
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,080
number of destinations in the UK—London, Cardiff, Birmingham, East Midlands, Manchester,

117
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,100
Newcastle, Glasgow, and Belfast.

118
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,180
Of course, it's much more complicated to find eight small planes than just one large

119
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,900
plane, so that's what they did—they found the largest passenger plane in the world.

120
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,680
Every flight the A380 flew ran just the two hours from Palma to Manchester and then from

121
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,500
Manchester, buses ran to Glasgow, Newcastle, East Midlands, Birmingham, and London.

122
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,160
Using this system, with just one aircraft, the CAA was able to run up to three flights

123
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,680
a day from Palma to the UK with capacity for nearly 1,500 passengers—the equivalent to

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,520
almost seven Thomas Cook A321s.

125
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,180
This whole process went on for weeks, making for a lucrative payday for the world's charter

126
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,380
companies and an expensive bill for the UK government, but it certainly is easier than

127
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,120
having hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded worldwide.

128
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,840
Having a record-breaking airline collapse and then another record-breaking airline collapse

129
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,100
in the span of two years is certainly not normal and it's certainly not a coincidence.

130
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,660
Part of the problem is that the airline industry has been so robust in the past decade that

131
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,360
it has allowed weaker airlines to survive.

132
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,620
Out of the bankrupted airlines mentioned at the start—Monarch, Air Berlin, Premier Air,

133
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,020
Cobalt Air, Wow Air, Air Glazer, XL Airways France, Adria Airlines, and Thomas Cook—five

134
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,560
were focused on long-haul, low-cost flying.

135
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,860
This business model is a rather new phenomenon made possible, at least on paper, by smaller

136
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:53,700
fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft and low fuel costs but, outside of Asia and Australia,

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,020
no airline has really achieved sustained profitability with this model.

138
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,840
AirAsia X, Scoot, and Jetstar are really the only airlines worldwide that have seen long-term

139
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,940
financial success flying long-haul, low-cost.

140
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,720
After fuel prices plummeted in 2014, these airlines entered a period of rapid expansion

141
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,860
as they were able to undercut the incumbents' prices significantly but then, in 2017, fuel

142
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,340
prices started ticking back up and these airlines had a tough choice—they could either raise

143
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,460
prices and lose some of the market share they had built up or keep prices the same and grow

144
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,740
further away from profitability.

145
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Many chose the latter and, as fuel prices continued to rise, the companies began to

146
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
fall.

147
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,660
Many analysts have also suggested that another contributing factor to this spate of airline

148
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,000
collapses is overcapacity.

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,920
Somewhat as a result of how successful and profitable the industry has been over the

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,440
past decade, airlines have been buying planes like crazy and investors have been funding

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
airlines like crazy.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,760
For a while, the rule has been that adding more capacity means more profits, however,

153
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
the industry has likely found a ceiling to that rule.

154
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,680
This is especially true in Europe's market, where buying an additional plane that you

155
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,200
might be able to fill in the summer means paying for it throughout the long winter too

156
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,440
when it might sit empty.

157
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,700
What's for sure, though, is that Thomas Cook will not be the last to fall.

158
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,860
It is only getting tougher to survive as an airline, especially in Europe, and each year,

159
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,480
without fail, another big name too will topple in September or October—the latest victim

160
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,580
in the world's annual airline culling season.
