1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Tesla has never been good at building cars.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,760
Even before deliveries began, forums sparked up with concerns over the Tesla Roadster's

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,320
panel alignment.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
Since then, as the cars hit the road and the company shot skyward, complaints about Model

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,600
Ss with windows that leak when it rains or mispositioned wire looms, and Model Xs with

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,200
drooping window seals or mysterious rattles when reaching speed have become commonplace.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,000
When the Model 3 started rolling off the lots, the feedback was more of the same.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,880
The car was exciting and mostly great, it just wasn't built great.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,160
Condensation fogged headlights, interior paneling popped off, exterior pieces were misaligned,

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,520
paint jobs were inconsistent, and some seals failed to hold while others were drowned in

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,520
adhesives.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,440
No matter the year, the model, or the factory of origin, buying a new Tesla has always been

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,560
a roll of a dice where the bad rolls have been laid out on Twitter.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,440
Of course, social media posts are inherently anecdotal in nature, but Tesla's struggle

15
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,280
to deliver a consistent product goes beyond outraged individuals.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,180
Scroll YouTube's results for Tesla build quality, and the search will populate far

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,440
more videos offering negative feedback than positive.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,760
Or take this poll on Tesla's subreddit, where a majority of all respondents reported

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,880
at least minor or cosmetic issues with their vehicle.

20
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,040
While Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit may all have a bias towards negativity, you can take

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,900
it from the man himself, Elon Musk, who admitted that the company's build quality waned when

22
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,880
production ramped up.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,000
Or for perhaps the most objective stance of all, there's the Consumer Reports annual

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,640
reliability rankings, where Tesla placed second to last in 2021, and 19th out of 24 manufacturers

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,400
in 2022.

26
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,520
The company simply struggles to deliver consistent, reliable, well-assembled vehicles.

27
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,160
It's been a problem since the beginning, it's been a problem the company has sought

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,740
to address time and time again, and it's been a problem that's taken different forms

29
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
over the years.

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,160
But it's not a problem Tesla's tried to hide—it's not a deep, dirty secret, but

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,080
rather something that comes with the territory.

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Tesla has lacked the consistency of legacy car manufacturers.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,980
After all, they aren't a legacy car manufacturer—they're the plucky upstart, the company that's been

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,520
bent on changing the world, the company that's moved fast and broke stuff.

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,600
The side effect's been inconsistent products, but from the perspective of the consumer,

36
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,600
what's one minor rattle or subtle paint problem when you're leading the charge towards

37
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,660
a brighter, bolder, greener, gasless future, right?

38
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:36,680
But even after building the car, Tesla struggles with a step that customers never even knew

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,600
could go sideways.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,440
If Tesla's bad at building cars, then they're at best hit or miss when it comes to delivering

41
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,440
them.

42
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,980
At certain points, when favorable conditions exist, Tesla delivery has been more than punctual.

43
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,280
In the case of the Model Y at the end of 2022, slack in demand and increasing production

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,900
capacity at Tesla's Texas factory shrunk delivery times to a matter of weeks, but for

45
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,560
every November of 2022, there's a September of 2018.

46
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,360
By the middle of that year, long after Tesla announced the arrival of the sedan-style Model

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,500
3, and after some 450,000 eager customers had put down deposits for the vehicle, the

48
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,820
company was way behind, only having delivered around 10,000.

49
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,740
By September, Musk described Tesla's predicament as delivery logistics hell, but to be at the

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,700
bleeding edge of what feels like a revolutionary purchase, Tesla buyers are generally willing

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
to wait.

52
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,640
In fact, as the delivery problems mounted, some of the brands most loyal offered to volunteer

53
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,060
at delivery centers and help with customer service.

54
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,060
What Tesla customers didn't like, however, was being left to wait in the dark, or worse,

55
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,640
feeling misled.

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,780
Some of those who were once happy to wait showed up at delivery centers for their new

57
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,380
Model 3, only to find that there wasn't one waiting for them, or that it had been

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,280
damaged in shipping, or that they had been mistaken for someone with the same first name.

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,100
Others excitedly waited for their delivery deadline, only to receive a call just days

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,980
before that there would be another delay.

61
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:06,020
Some of the scorn demanded refunds, others went to Twitter searching for answers when

62
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,060
they couldn't get through to anyone at Tesla.

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,820
Many let the experience shape their opinion.

64
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,460
Now, ultimately, Tesla pulled itself out of the hole it dug, and the exasperated early

65
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,580
adopters finally got their cars.

66
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,020
But the problems persist—buyers still check in on their delivery date only to see that

67
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,020
it's been bumped back a month, customers save their get-ready-for-delivery-in-two-weeks

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,540
notices only for them to start piling up in their inbox, and the frustrated still ask

69
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,940
what's going on over Twitter because that's the easiest means of getting an answer.

70
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,660
Frustrations have also expanded beyond the labyrinth-like buying process too—not only

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,420
are Teslas more numerous than ever, some of them are now a decade old.

72
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,280
As it's become common to see Teslas almost anywhere nationwide, the company only established

73
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,080
163 service centers spread across the US.

74
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,900
That means if you own a Tesla in Flagstaff, Arizona, you're about 150 miles or 240 kilometers

75
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,240
away from anyone certified to work on your vehicle.

76
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,340
If you live in Wichita, Kansas, your nearest options are all a state border and a two-hour

77
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,880
drive away.

78
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,240
Making things more difficult, service centers are low on loaner vehicles, so getting from

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,400
Phoenix back to Flagstaff or Kansas City to Wichita requires a creative application of

80
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,920
Tesla-supplied Uber vouchers.

81
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,220
Even as the company continues to expand its mobile service fleet, the growth of the service

82
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,040
team is being outpaced by the total number of Teslas hitting American roads.

83
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,480
So, whether stationary or mobile, Tesla's service capabilities are being overwhelmed.

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,560
What were once appointment wait times numbered in days have become numbered in weeks that

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,200
are increasingly liable to cancel.

86
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,400
Tesla's driving functions are reliable—an inherent plus of the electric drivetrain—but

87
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,720
everything else is clearly not.

88
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,680
So facing inconvenient service, Tesla owners just wait, listening to their rattles, air

89
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,640
tones, and wind squeals for years, feeling increasingly fleeced by the company that demanded

90
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,160
luxury car prices for something that looks nice but feels cheap.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,720
So, the company is burning through their existing customers—a group most likely to buy future

92
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,540
Teslas—which is certainly a problem, but perhaps even more concerningly, it's tough

93
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,180
to understand what they're doing to attract new ones.

94
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,320
It hardly seems like it's by offering them a deal—compare a Model Y Long Range to a

95
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,160
Mustang Mach-E Premium, and it has slightly better acceleration, slightly longer range,

96
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,520
but a slightly higher price.

97
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,000
As far as distinguishable differences go, there are a few.

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,760
It's a similar story upmarket with the Model S—the lucid air nearly matches on acceleration,

99
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,720
beats it on range, and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would

100
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
bat an eye.

101
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
And then if you go all the way to the other side of the market, Tesla is bested by Chevrolet,

102
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,920
whose base model Bull EV starts for some $15,000 less than the base Model 3, while coming close

103
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
on many specs.

104
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,080
So, it's clear that Tesla is not trying to compete based on price, so it's probably

105
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,700
something else.

106
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,320
Maybe it's by offering something different—maybe they're trying to entice the market by offering

107
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,960
a vehicle that nobody else does, but everybody else wants.

108
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,840
Well, while unique in their minimalistic design, the broad strokes of Tesla's product lineup

109
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,340
is uniquely basic.

110
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,540
Upmarket sedan, mid-market SUV, upmarket sedan, upmarket SUV—that's it.

111
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:32,380
Bafflingly, Tesla had the opportunity to differentiate its product lineup, and it recognized how

112
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,900
massive an opportunity doing so would be, but then just didn't.

113
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,500
Year after year after year, it's never been a surprise who will top the list of American

114
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,620
vehicle sales.

115
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,900
It's the Ford F-Series.

116
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,600
It's always the Ford F-Series.

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:54,120
In Kansas or Texas or Louisiana, the pickup represents about one of every 20 new car sales.

118
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,520
In Wyoming, it's more like one in 16, while up in Montana, one in every 13 new cars is

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,240
a Ford F-150.

120
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,780
These pickups are just so popular, and the only vehicles that even come close to their

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,120
sales figures are close equivalents like the Chevy Silverado or Ram trucks.

122
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,580
Americans just love their pickups, and the market is uniquely consolidated compared to

123
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,740
other vehicle types, so recognizing this, a decade ago, Musk announced Tesla would go

124
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,660
after the F-150 with an EV equivalent—a prime opportunity to disrupt a vulnerable

125
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,420
market.

126
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,820
Six years after that, Ford announced they'd just build an electric version of the F-150.

127
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,860
Three years after that, it entered production, and today, there are thousands of F-150 Lightnings

128
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,820
on the road and exactly zero Tesla pickups.

129
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,620
Adding to the woes, the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Hummer

130
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,100
EV and Rivian R1T, meaning there are three manufacturers already in production, working

131
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,460
out the kinks, ramping up to massive scale in 2023.

132
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,420
Even the earliest possible Tesla Cybertruck production dates will therefore compete against

133
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,820
at least three major entrenched mature competitors.

134
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,420
Plenty have criticized far more about the Tesla Cybertruck concept, speculating that

135
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,700
consumers will shirk its audacious shape, that regulators will reject its innovative

136
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,100
design, that component costs will make its purported price impossible.

137
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,340
That could all be true—in fact, considering Musk himself admitted the company did zero

138
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,120
market research for the vehicle, it more likely is—but perhaps the most crucial critique

139
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,020
of the vehicle is the fact that it doesn't yet exist.

140
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,620
First moves matter.

141
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,900
Consumers can read a review about the Lightning, take a Rivian on a test drive, even walk up

142
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,780
to a dealer and buy a Hummer EV today, while the Cybertruck is relegated to the More tab

143
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,140
of Tesla's website, featuring absolutely zero specifications or even prices—merely

144
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:53,780
the option to leave a $100 refundable deposit for the chance to get in line to buy the vehicle

145
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,300
once it finally exists.

146
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,940
While the devoted few will maintain that the Cybertruck will change the game, it would

147
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,020
have been far easier for Tesla to define the game—years ago, when it first recognized

148
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,340
the opportunity that it later squandered.

149
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,420
But maybe they're not trying to compete on cost, and maybe they're not trying to

150
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,620
compete on differentiation.

151
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,740
Maybe China is the answer.

152
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,460
Tesla believed that enough to cozy up at the CCP and open a factory in Shanghai, largely

153
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,020
to produce cars for the Chinese market itself, and this has gone decently.

154
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,220
They sell tens of thousands of vehicles to the country each month, accounting for about

155
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,140
40% of the company's total sales, but in the largest EV market in the world, Tesla

156
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,220
is not the largest EV manufacturer.

157
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,900
That's BYD.

158
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,980
No company globally produces more EVs—they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective—but

159
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,400
that's not the most staggering part.

160
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
This is.

161
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,460
Their growth rate is ferocious.

162
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,340
And here's Tesla's.

163
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:57,780
It is famously difficult for Western companies to sustainably compete in the Chinese market.

164
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:04,900
Amazon failed, Uber failed, Airbnb failed, Google, Best Buy, Home Depot, Macy's, eBay,

165
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
Yahoo.

166
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,380
It's harder to find one that did work than didn't.

167
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,100
China is just such an immense market that there are equivalent quality alternatives

168
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,540
to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers,

169
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,460
which leave Western managers dumbfounded.

170
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,940
They don't understand why they're getting beat, and that's the point.

171
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,000
They don't understand.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,240
Chinese companies are able to fulfill the tiny, unique, nuanced preferences of Chinese

173
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,500
consumers better than foreigners, so in Tesla's case, inevitably, their vehicles are going

174
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,800
to be worse for Chinese consumers than the homegrown alternatives, and unless they succeed

175
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,540
where almost all their equivalents have failed, they just won't be able to understand why.

176
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,960
Foreign-made vehicles do sell in China, but primarily as luxury goods—selling American-ness

177
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,320
or German-ness or British-ness as a brand—rather than competing on the merits of the vehicles

178
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,320
themselves.

179
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,760
That means that China can be a massive market for Tesla, but they'll struggle to go mass-market.

180
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:09,720
They'll always be a secondary player, meaning it might not be a market worth betting on.

181
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,660
So maybe it's not price, not differentiation, not market, not any of the traditional ways

182
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,720
that companies gain an edge.

183
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Maybe it's innovation.

184
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,880
In 2016, after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns, Tesla

185
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,140
charted a new vision for full self-driving, and quickly started selling a software package

186
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,820
referred to as full self-driving for $3,000 soon after.

187
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,160
But full self-driving didn't exactly mean full self-driving.

188
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:41,000
Rather, it meant adaptive cruise control, auto steer, auto lane change, auto park, traffic

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,060
light recognition, and a few other driver assist features depending on street type,

190
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,920
each requiring driver intervention to manage and monitor, but not full self-driving.

191
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,500
Not yet.

192
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,540
Musk said that would probably come in 2017, when the vehicle would be able to drive coast-to-coast

193
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,540
from LA to New York without a single human touch, not even for charging.

194
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,080
That didn't happen.

195
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:09,240
It also didn't happen in 2018, or 2019, or 2020, or 2021 either, and all the while,

196
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,580
Musk and Tesla salespeople, following orders, pressured consumers into paying for the software

197
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:17,820
upgrade, telling them to get it now before the price would rise, which it did, all the

198
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:25,780
way to $15,000, despite the fact that, still today, Teslas are not capable of full self-driving.

199
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,820
There's now an open beta for something closer to true full self-driving, but far away from

200
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:34,820
that vision of touchless trips from LA to New York.

201
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,460
It's erratic and imperfect, in a way that requires a significant degree of human oversight

202
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,100
and intervention to avoid becoming a liability on the road.

203
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:47,820
Arguably, right now, it's more trouble than it's worth, but the issue for Tesla is less

204
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,420
about whether its full self-driving works.

205
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:55,340
It's that, for the better part of a decade now, it sold consumers on the promise, failed

206
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:01,780
to deliver, made new promises, failed to deliver, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.

207
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,420
The type of autonomous that was promised will be game-changing, so the sales pitch worked,

208
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,740
but once again, the company has burned through its most promising customer base—existing

209
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,460
owners.

210
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,540
Tesla is facing class-action lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations over

211
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,060
its autonomous program, but even if those lead to nothing, even if it's navigated

212
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:27,760
strategic ambiguity properly to legally mislead, the reputation Tesla has earned as a company

213
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,780
whose word means nothing has to have an impact.

214
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:37,980
Okay, so, not price, not differentiation, not market, not innovation—maybe it's

215
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Musk?

216
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,100
Maybe his call to personality is so strong that consumers will buy the vehicle specifically

217
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,220
because it's his?

218
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
Maybe he's the brand?

219
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,780
In fact, maybe he's deliberately calibrating his public image to appeal to a demographic

220
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,580
less likely to buy an EV, strengthening that fledgling consumer segment for the company.

221
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,340
Well, if that's what's happening, it's not working.

222
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,100
According to a morning consult survey, Tesla's net favorability among Democrats plummeted

223
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:09,540
by 20.3% between October and November 2022, when Musk purchased Twitter and started making

224
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,980
a series of controversial changes and statements.

225
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,420
Among Republicans, the favorability actually increased, but only by 3.9%.

226
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:22,380
That's not nearly enough to make the move worth it for Tesla, because Republicans don't

227
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,460
buy EVs—only 25% of them said they would even consider them in the next year, while

228
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,820
44% of Democrats did.

229
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,140
So, if you make the very simple assumption that a company's favorability correlates

230
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,660
to its shares, Elon Musk's actions objectively reduced Tesla's sales and took money out

231
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,940
of its shareholders' pockets.

232
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,220
While Musk might have been the visionary behind the disruptive behemoth, today he's a liability—an

233
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,460
increasingly unlikeable loose cannon who can't seem to separate his image from the company's.

234
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,780
There's not a whole lot left to set Tesla apart.

235
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,260
This isn't an existential threat—it's not like Tesla is going to suddenly start

236
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,260
fading away.

237
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,100
It's still a tremendously large, profitable company with an incredibly passionate fanbase

238
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,140
that will find ways to defend any and all accusations of weakness, and there are clearly

239
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,660
hordes of people that love their vehicles.

240
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,700
But people are learning to love other EVs, too.

241
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,460
Rife with quality issues, poor customer service, broken promises, and a generally amateur feeling,

242
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:29,060
consumers are taking the safe route and increasingly opting for the options put forward by the

243
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,900
incumbent manufacturers.

244
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,780
Meanwhile, startups like Rivian are looking at Tesla's shortcomings and addressing them,

245
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,660
offering better quality, better customer support, and better communication.

246
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,940
So, Tesla's just sitting there, preying on their downfall, letting market share just

247
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,060
march out the front door.

248
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,780
Tesla's competitive advantage was built on scarcity.

249
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:55,680
For most of their history, they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race.

250
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Consumers were willing to deal with bad quality and service and communication, because it's

251
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,340
the price you have to pay to get something groundbreaking.

252
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:07,340
But Tesla is no longer a startup—it's one of the largest companies in the world,

253
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,100
yet it still operates like a startup.

254
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,180
Meanwhile, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Rivian, and others are acting as the adults in the room.

255
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,620
Company culture is notoriously difficult to change, and that difficulty mounts the larger

256
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:25,100
company becomes, so when you have something as massive as Tesla that is still in startup

257
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,260
mentality, it is really hard to understand how that will change.

258
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,420
Tesla's fumble is what it could have been.

259
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,180
They had a decade-head start on the burgeoning industry that, within decades, will just be

260
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,500
known as the auto industry.

261
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,340
They could have been the auto manufacturer.

262
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
They could have been a giant.

263
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,700
They could have been Ford, GM, and Chrysler.

264
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,300
But instead, the other EVs are here.

265
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,980
They're popular, they're competitive, and while Tesla keeps making excuses, breaking

266
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,900
promises, burning bridges, and swinging wildly for the fences to keep the hope alive, everyone

267
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,980
else is slowly and methodically chipping away.

268
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,820
Maybe Tesla succeeds.

269
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:10,020
Maybe it's able to use its dominant market position to maintain its dominant market position,

270
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,040
but what sure is that it's going to be a whole lot harder than it had to be.

271
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,620
This day of mature mainstream EV market competition was always going to come, and yet Tesla did

272
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,900
little to prepare, and did lots to open up pathways for their competitors to eat into

273
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,360
their market share.

274
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,880
So if, in ten years, Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America, the

275
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,120
explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade, and more about

276
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,780
what it didn't do in the years it squandered, leading up to today.

277
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,700
This video sponsors Wren, and some of you may be surprised by that, because Wren is

278
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,040
a carbon offsetting provider.

279
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,060
Last year I made a video about how the carbon offsetting market is a scam because it incentivizes

280
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,420
ineffective offsets that actually increase overall carbon output.

281
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,620
That video got a ton of attention, even making it onto Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,

282
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,900
meaning it made it all the way to the people behind Wren.

283
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:07,320
Their whole idea is to be a carbon offsetting provider that has the greatest chance of actually

284
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,320
working.

285
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,240
Now, I want to be careful to say that I'm not encouraging anyone to carbon offset.

286
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,020
I think that's really down to you, because at the end of the day, carbon offsetting is

287
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,480
not going to solve climate change.

288
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,920
Only top-down legislative action can do that, but if you, like me, want to do everything

289
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,920
possible to reduce the likelihood that your life is perpetuating the problem, then Wren

290
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,220
is probably the best offsetter to use.

291
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,520
Before even considering taking a sponsorship, I got on the phone with their CEO, had a project

292
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,120
evaluation, and a few others from their leadership team, and grilled them with questions for

293
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,240
more than an hour about how their project evaluation process works, why they pick the

294
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,480
projects they do, what they do if a project goes wrong, and they had really thoughtful,

295
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,640
detailed, upfront answers to everything.

296
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,680
Inherently, there's always going to be uncertainty when creating a carbon offsetting program,

297
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,160
but Wren has worked to reduce the risks that uncertainty poses by only allowing Offset3

298
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,360
a portfolio of their eight active projects, meaning if one fails, the others are still

299
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
there to keep the average stable.

300
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,840
That also means they're able to fund projects that certainly have an impact, but are tougher

301
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
to quantify.

302
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,040
For example, their Carbon180 project funds political advocacy for other projects and

303
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,240
policies that will curb carbon emissions, which could be incredibly effective, but is

304
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,200
obviously high risk and tough to quantify compared to a more traditional project like

305
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,960
producing and distributing clean cooking fuel to refugees.

306
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
I can't possibly explain all the methods Wren uses to assure the effectiveness of what

307
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,980
they do, but they do a really impressive job of explaining it in an understandable way,

308
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,400
so I'd encourage you to dig into their website until you're satisfied.

309
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,600
So if you want to offset your carbon footprint, make sure it's effective and do it with

310
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Wren.
