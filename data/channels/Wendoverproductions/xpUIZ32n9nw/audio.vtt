00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Tesla has never been good at building cars.

00:05.440 --> 00:10.760
Even before deliveries began, forums sparked up with concerns over the Tesla Roadster's

00:10.760 --> 00:12.320
panel alignment.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.800
Since then, as the cars hit the road and the company shot skyward, complaints about Model

00:16.800 --> 00:21.600
Ss with windows that leak when it rains or mispositioned wire looms, and Model Xs with

00:21.600 --> 00:26.200
drooping window seals or mysterious rattles when reaching speed have become commonplace.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.000
When the Model 3 started rolling off the lots, the feedback was more of the same.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.880
The car was exciting and mostly great, it just wasn't built great.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.160
Condensation fogged headlights, interior paneling popped off, exterior pieces were misaligned,

00:41.160 --> 00:45.520
paint jobs were inconsistent, and some seals failed to hold while others were drowned in

00:45.520 --> 00:46.520
adhesives.

00:46.520 --> 00:51.440
No matter the year, the model, or the factory of origin, buying a new Tesla has always been

00:51.440 --> 00:55.560
a roll of a dice where the bad rolls have been laid out on Twitter.

00:55.560 --> 01:00.440
Of course, social media posts are inherently anecdotal in nature, but Tesla's struggle

01:00.440 --> 01:05.280
to deliver a consistent product goes beyond outraged individuals.

01:05.280 --> 01:09.180
Scroll YouTube's results for Tesla build quality, and the search will populate far

01:09.180 --> 01:12.440
more videos offering negative feedback than positive.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.760
Or take this poll on Tesla's subreddit, where a majority of all respondents reported

01:16.760 --> 01:19.880
at least minor or cosmetic issues with their vehicle.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.040
While Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit may all have a bias towards negativity, you can take

01:24.040 --> 01:28.900
it from the man himself, Elon Musk, who admitted that the company's build quality waned when

01:28.900 --> 01:30.880
production ramped up.

01:30.880 --> 01:35.000
Or for perhaps the most objective stance of all, there's the Consumer Reports annual

01:35.000 --> 01:41.640
reliability rankings, where Tesla placed second to last in 2021, and 19th out of 24 manufacturers

01:41.640 --> 01:43.400
in 2022.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.520
The company simply struggles to deliver consistent, reliable, well-assembled vehicles.

01:48.520 --> 01:52.160
It's been a problem since the beginning, it's been a problem the company has sought

01:52.160 --> 01:56.740
to address time and time again, and it's been a problem that's taken different forms

01:56.740 --> 01:57.740
over the years.

01:57.740 --> 02:02.160
But it's not a problem Tesla's tried to hide—it's not a deep, dirty secret, but

02:02.160 --> 02:05.080
rather something that comes with the territory.

02:05.080 --> 02:09.080
Tesla has lacked the consistency of legacy car manufacturers.

02:09.080 --> 02:13.980
After all, they aren't a legacy car manufacturer—they're the plucky upstart, the company that's been

02:13.980 --> 02:18.520
bent on changing the world, the company that's moved fast and broke stuff.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.600
The side effect's been inconsistent products, but from the perspective of the consumer,

02:22.600 --> 02:26.600
what's one minor rattle or subtle paint problem when you're leading the charge towards

02:26.600 --> 02:31.660
a brighter, bolder, greener, gasless future, right?

02:31.660 --> 02:36.680
But even after building the car, Tesla struggles with a step that customers never even knew

02:36.680 --> 02:38.600
could go sideways.

02:38.600 --> 02:43.440
If Tesla's bad at building cars, then they're at best hit or miss when it comes to delivering

02:43.440 --> 02:44.440
them.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.980
At certain points, when favorable conditions exist, Tesla delivery has been more than punctual.

02:49.980 --> 02:54.280
In the case of the Model Y at the end of 2022, slack in demand and increasing production

02:54.280 --> 02:58.900
capacity at Tesla's Texas factory shrunk delivery times to a matter of weeks, but for

02:58.900 --> 03:02.560
every November of 2022, there's a September of 2018.

03:02.560 --> 03:07.360
By the middle of that year, long after Tesla announced the arrival of the sedan-style Model

03:07.360 --> 03:12.500
3, and after some 450,000 eager customers had put down deposits for the vehicle, the

03:12.500 --> 03:16.820
company was way behind, only having delivered around 10,000.

03:16.820 --> 03:22.740
By September, Musk described Tesla's predicament as delivery logistics hell, but to be at the

03:22.740 --> 03:27.700
bleeding edge of what feels like a revolutionary purchase, Tesla buyers are generally willing

03:27.700 --> 03:28.700
to wait.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.640
In fact, as the delivery problems mounted, some of the brands most loyal offered to volunteer

03:33.640 --> 03:37.060
at delivery centers and help with customer service.

03:37.060 --> 03:42.060
What Tesla customers didn't like, however, was being left to wait in the dark, or worse,

03:42.060 --> 03:43.640
feeling misled.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.780
Some of those who were once happy to wait showed up at delivery centers for their new

03:46.780 --> 03:50.380
Model 3, only to find that there wasn't one waiting for them, or that it had been

03:50.380 --> 03:55.280
damaged in shipping, or that they had been mistaken for someone with the same first name.

03:55.280 --> 03:59.100
Others excitedly waited for their delivery deadline, only to receive a call just days

03:59.100 --> 04:01.980
before that there would be another delay.

04:01.980 --> 04:06.020
Some of the scorn demanded refunds, others went to Twitter searching for answers when

04:06.020 --> 04:09.060
they couldn't get through to anyone at Tesla.

04:09.060 --> 04:11.820
Many let the experience shape their opinion.

04:11.820 --> 04:16.460
Now, ultimately, Tesla pulled itself out of the hole it dug, and the exasperated early

04:16.460 --> 04:18.580
adopters finally got their cars.

04:18.580 --> 04:23.020
But the problems persist—buyers still check in on their delivery date only to see that

04:23.020 --> 04:27.020
it's been bumped back a month, customers save their get-ready-for-delivery-in-two-weeks

04:27.020 --> 04:31.540
notices only for them to start piling up in their inbox, and the frustrated still ask

04:31.540 --> 04:35.940
what's going on over Twitter because that's the easiest means of getting an answer.

04:35.940 --> 04:40.660
Frustrations have also expanded beyond the labyrinth-like buying process too—not only

04:40.660 --> 04:45.420
are Teslas more numerous than ever, some of them are now a decade old.

04:45.420 --> 04:50.280
As it's become common to see Teslas almost anywhere nationwide, the company only established

04:50.280 --> 04:54.080
163 service centers spread across the US.

04:54.080 --> 04:59.900
That means if you own a Tesla in Flagstaff, Arizona, you're about 150 miles or 240 kilometers

04:59.900 --> 05:03.240
away from anyone certified to work on your vehicle.

05:03.240 --> 05:08.340
If you live in Wichita, Kansas, your nearest options are all a state border and a two-hour

05:08.340 --> 05:09.880
drive away.

05:09.880 --> 05:14.240
Making things more difficult, service centers are low on loaner vehicles, so getting from

05:14.240 --> 05:19.400
Phoenix back to Flagstaff or Kansas City to Wichita requires a creative application of

05:19.400 --> 05:21.920
Tesla-supplied Uber vouchers.

05:21.920 --> 05:26.220
Even as the company continues to expand its mobile service fleet, the growth of the service

05:26.220 --> 05:31.040
team is being outpaced by the total number of Teslas hitting American roads.

05:31.040 --> 05:36.480
So, whether stationary or mobile, Tesla's service capabilities are being overwhelmed.

05:36.480 --> 05:41.560
What were once appointment wait times numbered in days have become numbered in weeks that

05:41.560 --> 05:44.200
are increasingly liable to cancel.

05:44.200 --> 05:49.400
Tesla's driving functions are reliable—an inherent plus of the electric drivetrain—but

05:49.400 --> 05:51.720
everything else is clearly not.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.680
So facing inconvenient service, Tesla owners just wait, listening to their rattles, air

05:56.680 --> 06:01.640
tones, and wind squeals for years, feeling increasingly fleeced by the company that demanded

06:01.640 --> 06:06.160
luxury car prices for something that looks nice but feels cheap.

06:06.160 --> 06:12.720
So, the company is burning through their existing customers—a group most likely to buy future

06:12.720 --> 06:17.540
Teslas—which is certainly a problem, but perhaps even more concerningly, it's tough

06:17.540 --> 06:21.180
to understand what they're doing to attract new ones.

06:21.180 --> 06:25.320
It hardly seems like it's by offering them a deal—compare a Model Y Long Range to a

06:25.320 --> 06:30.160
Mustang Mach-E Premium, and it has slightly better acceleration, slightly longer range,

06:30.160 --> 06:32.520
but a slightly higher price.

06:32.520 --> 06:36.000
As far as distinguishable differences go, there are a few.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.760
It's a similar story upmarket with the Model S—the lucid air nearly matches on acceleration,

06:41.760 --> 06:45.720
beats it on range, and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would

06:45.720 --> 06:46.720
bat an eye.

06:46.720 --> 06:51.440
And then if you go all the way to the other side of the market, Tesla is bested by Chevrolet,

06:51.440 --> 06:57.920
whose base model Bull EV starts for some $15,000 less than the base Model 3, while coming close

06:57.920 --> 06:58.920
on many specs.

06:58.920 --> 07:04.080
So, it's clear that Tesla is not trying to compete based on price, so it's probably

07:04.080 --> 07:05.700
something else.

07:05.700 --> 07:10.320
Maybe it's by offering something different—maybe they're trying to entice the market by offering

07:10.320 --> 07:13.960
a vehicle that nobody else does, but everybody else wants.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.840
Well, while unique in their minimalistic design, the broad strokes of Tesla's product lineup

07:18.840 --> 07:21.340
is uniquely basic.

07:21.340 --> 07:27.540
Upmarket sedan, mid-market SUV, upmarket sedan, upmarket SUV—that's it.

07:27.540 --> 07:32.380
Bafflingly, Tesla had the opportunity to differentiate its product lineup, and it recognized how

07:32.380 --> 07:37.900
massive an opportunity doing so would be, but then just didn't.

07:37.900 --> 07:42.500
Year after year after year, it's never been a surprise who will top the list of American

07:42.500 --> 07:43.620
vehicle sales.

07:43.620 --> 07:44.900
It's the Ford F-Series.

07:44.900 --> 07:47.600
It's always the Ford F-Series.

07:47.600 --> 07:54.120
In Kansas or Texas or Louisiana, the pickup represents about one of every 20 new car sales.

07:54.120 --> 07:59.520
In Wyoming, it's more like one in 16, while up in Montana, one in every 13 new cars is

07:59.520 --> 08:01.240
a Ford F-150.

08:01.240 --> 08:05.780
These pickups are just so popular, and the only vehicles that even come close to their

08:05.780 --> 08:11.120
sales figures are close equivalents like the Chevy Silverado or Ram trucks.

08:11.120 --> 08:15.580
Americans just love their pickups, and the market is uniquely consolidated compared to

08:15.580 --> 08:20.740
other vehicle types, so recognizing this, a decade ago, Musk announced Tesla would go

08:20.740 --> 08:26.660
after the F-150 with an EV equivalent—a prime opportunity to disrupt a vulnerable

08:26.660 --> 08:28.420
market.

08:28.420 --> 08:32.820
Six years after that, Ford announced they'd just build an electric version of the F-150.

08:32.820 --> 08:37.860
Three years after that, it entered production, and today, there are thousands of F-150 Lightnings

08:37.860 --> 08:41.820
on the road and exactly zero Tesla pickups.

08:41.860 --> 08:46.620
Adding to the woes, the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Hummer

08:46.620 --> 08:52.100
EV and Rivian R1T, meaning there are three manufacturers already in production, working

08:52.100 --> 08:56.460
out the kinks, ramping up to massive scale in 2023.

08:56.460 --> 09:00.420
Even the earliest possible Tesla Cybertruck production dates will therefore compete against

09:00.420 --> 09:04.820
at least three major entrenched mature competitors.

09:04.820 --> 09:09.420
Plenty have criticized far more about the Tesla Cybertruck concept, speculating that

09:09.420 --> 09:13.700
consumers will shirk its audacious shape, that regulators will reject its innovative

09:13.700 --> 09:18.100
design, that component costs will make its purported price impossible.

09:18.100 --> 09:22.340
That could all be true—in fact, considering Musk himself admitted the company did zero

09:22.340 --> 09:27.120
market research for the vehicle, it more likely is—but perhaps the most crucial critique

09:27.120 --> 09:31.020
of the vehicle is the fact that it doesn't yet exist.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.620
First moves matter.

09:33.620 --> 09:37.900
Consumers can read a review about the Lightning, take a Rivian on a test drive, even walk up

09:37.900 --> 09:42.780
to a dealer and buy a Hummer EV today, while the Cybertruck is relegated to the More tab

09:42.780 --> 09:48.140
of Tesla's website, featuring absolutely zero specifications or even prices—merely

09:48.140 --> 09:53.780
the option to leave a $100 refundable deposit for the chance to get in line to buy the vehicle

09:53.780 --> 09:56.300
once it finally exists.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.940
While the devoted few will maintain that the Cybertruck will change the game, it would

09:59.940 --> 10:05.020
have been far easier for Tesla to define the game—years ago, when it first recognized

10:05.020 --> 10:08.340
the opportunity that it later squandered.

10:08.340 --> 10:11.420
But maybe they're not trying to compete on cost, and maybe they're not trying to

10:11.420 --> 10:13.620
compete on differentiation.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.740
Maybe China is the answer.

10:15.740 --> 10:20.460
Tesla believed that enough to cozy up at the CCP and open a factory in Shanghai, largely

10:20.460 --> 10:25.020
to produce cars for the Chinese market itself, and this has gone decently.

10:25.020 --> 10:29.220
They sell tens of thousands of vehicles to the country each month, accounting for about

10:29.220 --> 10:34.140
40% of the company's total sales, but in the largest EV market in the world, Tesla

10:34.140 --> 10:37.220
is not the largest EV manufacturer.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.900
That's BYD.

10:38.900 --> 10:43.980
No company globally produces more EVs—they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective—but

10:43.980 --> 10:46.400
that's not the most staggering part.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
This is.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.460
Their growth rate is ferocious.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.340
And here's Tesla's.

10:52.340 --> 10:57.780
It is famously difficult for Western companies to sustainably compete in the Chinese market.

10:57.780 --> 11:04.900
Amazon failed, Uber failed, Airbnb failed, Google, Best Buy, Home Depot, Macy's, eBay,

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
Yahoo.

11:05.900 --> 11:09.380
It's harder to find one that did work than didn't.

11:09.380 --> 11:13.100
China is just such an immense market that there are equivalent quality alternatives

11:13.100 --> 11:17.540
to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers,

11:17.540 --> 11:20.460
which leave Western managers dumbfounded.

11:20.460 --> 11:23.940
They don't understand why they're getting beat, and that's the point.

11:23.940 --> 11:26.000
They don't understand.

11:26.000 --> 11:30.240
Chinese companies are able to fulfill the tiny, unique, nuanced preferences of Chinese

11:30.240 --> 11:35.500
consumers better than foreigners, so in Tesla's case, inevitably, their vehicles are going

11:35.500 --> 11:39.800
to be worse for Chinese consumers than the homegrown alternatives, and unless they succeed

11:39.800 --> 11:45.540
where almost all their equivalents have failed, they just won't be able to understand why.

11:45.540 --> 11:50.960
Foreign-made vehicles do sell in China, but primarily as luxury goods—selling American-ness

11:50.960 --> 11:56.320
or German-ness or British-ness as a brand—rather than competing on the merits of the vehicles

11:56.320 --> 11:57.320
themselves.

11:57.320 --> 12:01.760
That means that China can be a massive market for Tesla, but they'll struggle to go mass-market.

12:01.760 --> 12:09.720
They'll always be a secondary player, meaning it might not be a market worth betting on.

12:09.720 --> 12:14.660
So maybe it's not price, not differentiation, not market, not any of the traditional ways

12:14.660 --> 12:16.720
that companies gain an edge.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.720
Maybe it's innovation.

12:18.120 --> 12:22.880
In 2016, after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns, Tesla

12:22.880 --> 12:27.140
charted a new vision for full self-driving, and quickly started selling a software package

12:27.140 --> 12:31.820
referred to as full self-driving for $3,000 soon after.

12:31.820 --> 12:35.160
But full self-driving didn't exactly mean full self-driving.

12:35.160 --> 12:41.000
Rather, it meant adaptive cruise control, auto steer, auto lane change, auto park, traffic

12:41.000 --> 12:45.060
light recognition, and a few other driver assist features depending on street type,

12:45.220 --> 12:50.920
each requiring driver intervention to manage and monitor, but not full self-driving.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.500
Not yet.

12:52.500 --> 12:56.540
Musk said that would probably come in 2017, when the vehicle would be able to drive coast-to-coast

12:56.540 --> 13:00.540
from LA to New York without a single human touch, not even for charging.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.080
That didn't happen.

13:02.080 --> 13:09.240
It also didn't happen in 2018, or 2019, or 2020, or 2021 either, and all the while,

13:09.240 --> 13:13.580
Musk and Tesla salespeople, following orders, pressured consumers into paying for the software

13:13.580 --> 13:17.820
upgrade, telling them to get it now before the price would rise, which it did, all the

13:17.820 --> 13:25.780
way to $15,000, despite the fact that, still today, Teslas are not capable of full self-driving.

13:25.780 --> 13:31.820
There's now an open beta for something closer to true full self-driving, but far away from

13:31.820 --> 13:34.820
that vision of touchless trips from LA to New York.

13:34.820 --> 13:39.460
It's erratic and imperfect, in a way that requires a significant degree of human oversight

13:39.460 --> 13:43.100
and intervention to avoid becoming a liability on the road.

13:43.140 --> 13:47.820
Arguably, right now, it's more trouble than it's worth, but the issue for Tesla is less

13:47.820 --> 13:50.420
about whether its full self-driving works.

13:50.420 --> 13:55.340
It's that, for the better part of a decade now, it sold consumers on the promise, failed

13:55.340 --> 14:01.780
to deliver, made new promises, failed to deliver, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.

14:01.780 --> 14:06.420
The type of autonomous that was promised will be game-changing, so the sales pitch worked,

14:06.420 --> 14:11.740
but once again, the company has burned through its most promising customer base—existing

14:11.740 --> 14:13.460
owners.

14:13.460 --> 14:17.540
Tesla is facing class-action lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations over

14:17.540 --> 14:22.060
its autonomous program, but even if those lead to nothing, even if it's navigated

14:22.060 --> 14:27.760
strategic ambiguity properly to legally mislead, the reputation Tesla has earned as a company

14:27.760 --> 14:31.780
whose word means nothing has to have an impact.

14:31.780 --> 14:37.980
Okay, so, not price, not differentiation, not market, not innovation—maybe it's

14:37.980 --> 14:38.980
Musk?

14:39.180 --> 14:43.100
Maybe his call to personality is so strong that consumers will buy the vehicle specifically

14:43.100 --> 14:45.220
because it's his?

14:45.220 --> 14:46.220
Maybe he's the brand?

14:46.220 --> 14:50.780
In fact, maybe he's deliberately calibrating his public image to appeal to a demographic

14:50.780 --> 14:55.580
less likely to buy an EV, strengthening that fledgling consumer segment for the company.

14:55.580 --> 14:59.340
Well, if that's what's happening, it's not working.

14:59.340 --> 15:04.100
According to a morning consult survey, Tesla's net favorability among Democrats plummeted

15:04.100 --> 15:09.540
by 20.3% between October and November 2022, when Musk purchased Twitter and started making

15:09.540 --> 15:12.980
a series of controversial changes and statements.

15:12.980 --> 15:17.420
Among Republicans, the favorability actually increased, but only by 3.9%.

15:17.420 --> 15:22.380
That's not nearly enough to make the move worth it for Tesla, because Republicans don't

15:22.380 --> 15:27.460
buy EVs—only 25% of them said they would even consider them in the next year, while

15:27.460 --> 15:29.820
44% of Democrats did.

15:29.860 --> 15:34.140
So, if you make the very simple assumption that a company's favorability correlates

15:34.140 --> 15:40.660
to its shares, Elon Musk's actions objectively reduced Tesla's sales and took money out

15:40.660 --> 15:42.940
of its shareholders' pockets.

15:42.940 --> 15:48.220
While Musk might have been the visionary behind the disruptive behemoth, today he's a liability—an

15:48.220 --> 15:53.460
increasingly unlikeable loose cannon who can't seem to separate his image from the company's.

15:53.460 --> 15:57.780
There's not a whole lot left to set Tesla apart.

15:57.780 --> 16:02.260
This isn't an existential threat—it's not like Tesla is going to suddenly start

16:02.260 --> 16:03.260
fading away.

16:03.260 --> 16:08.100
It's still a tremendously large, profitable company with an incredibly passionate fanbase

16:08.100 --> 16:12.140
that will find ways to defend any and all accusations of weakness, and there are clearly

16:12.140 --> 16:14.660
hordes of people that love their vehicles.

16:14.660 --> 16:18.700
But people are learning to love other EVs, too.

16:18.700 --> 16:24.460
Rife with quality issues, poor customer service, broken promises, and a generally amateur feeling,

16:24.460 --> 16:29.060
consumers are taking the safe route and increasingly opting for the options put forward by the

16:29.060 --> 16:30.900
incumbent manufacturers.

16:30.900 --> 16:35.780
Meanwhile, startups like Rivian are looking at Tesla's shortcomings and addressing them,

16:35.780 --> 16:39.660
offering better quality, better customer support, and better communication.

16:39.660 --> 16:44.940
So, Tesla's just sitting there, preying on their downfall, letting market share just

16:44.940 --> 16:47.060
march out the front door.

16:47.060 --> 16:50.780
Tesla's competitive advantage was built on scarcity.

16:50.780 --> 16:55.680
For most of their history, they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.680
Consumers were willing to deal with bad quality and service and communication, because it's

16:59.680 --> 17:03.340
the price you have to pay to get something groundbreaking.

17:03.340 --> 17:07.340
But Tesla is no longer a startup—it's one of the largest companies in the world,

17:07.340 --> 17:10.100
yet it still operates like a startup.

17:10.100 --> 17:16.180
Meanwhile, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Rivian, and others are acting as the adults in the room.

17:16.180 --> 17:20.620
Company culture is notoriously difficult to change, and that difficulty mounts the larger

17:20.620 --> 17:25.100
company becomes, so when you have something as massive as Tesla that is still in startup

17:25.100 --> 17:29.260
mentality, it is really hard to understand how that will change.

17:29.260 --> 17:32.420
Tesla's fumble is what it could have been.

17:32.420 --> 17:37.180
They had a decade-head start on the burgeoning industry that, within decades, will just be

17:37.180 --> 17:39.500
known as the auto industry.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.340
They could have been the auto manufacturer.

17:42.340 --> 17:43.340
They could have been a giant.

17:43.340 --> 17:46.700
They could have been Ford, GM, and Chrysler.

17:46.700 --> 17:49.300
But instead, the other EVs are here.

17:49.300 --> 17:53.980
They're popular, they're competitive, and while Tesla keeps making excuses, breaking

17:53.980 --> 17:58.900
promises, burning bridges, and swinging wildly for the fences to keep the hope alive, everyone

17:58.900 --> 18:03.980
else is slowly and methodically chipping away.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.820
Maybe Tesla succeeds.

18:05.820 --> 18:10.020
Maybe it's able to use its dominant market position to maintain its dominant market position,

18:10.020 --> 18:15.040
but what sure is that it's going to be a whole lot harder than it had to be.

18:15.040 --> 18:20.620
This day of mature mainstream EV market competition was always going to come, and yet Tesla did

18:20.620 --> 18:24.900
little to prepare, and did lots to open up pathways for their competitors to eat into

18:24.900 --> 18:26.360
their market share.

18:26.360 --> 18:31.880
So if, in ten years, Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America, the

18:31.880 --> 18:36.120
explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade, and more about

18:36.120 --> 18:41.780
what it didn't do in the years it squandered, leading up to today.

18:41.780 --> 18:45.700
This video sponsors Wren, and some of you may be surprised by that, because Wren is

18:45.700 --> 18:48.040
a carbon offsetting provider.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.060
Last year I made a video about how the carbon offsetting market is a scam because it incentivizes

18:52.060 --> 18:55.420
ineffective offsets that actually increase overall carbon output.

18:55.420 --> 18:59.620
That video got a ton of attention, even making it onto Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,

18:59.620 --> 19:02.900
meaning it made it all the way to the people behind Wren.

19:02.900 --> 19:07.320
Their whole idea is to be a carbon offsetting provider that has the greatest chance of actually

19:07.320 --> 19:08.320
working.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.240
Now, I want to be careful to say that I'm not encouraging anyone to carbon offset.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.020
I think that's really down to you, because at the end of the day, carbon offsetting is

19:16.020 --> 19:18.480
not going to solve climate change.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.920
Only top-down legislative action can do that, but if you, like me, want to do everything

19:22.920 --> 19:26.920
possible to reduce the likelihood that your life is perpetuating the problem, then Wren

19:26.920 --> 19:30.220
is probably the best offsetter to use.

19:30.220 --> 19:34.520
Before even considering taking a sponsorship, I got on the phone with their CEO, had a project

19:34.520 --> 19:38.120
evaluation, and a few others from their leadership team, and grilled them with questions for

19:38.120 --> 19:42.240
more than an hour about how their project evaluation process works, why they pick the

19:42.240 --> 19:46.480
projects they do, what they do if a project goes wrong, and they had really thoughtful,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.640
detailed, upfront answers to everything.

19:48.640 --> 19:52.680
Inherently, there's always going to be uncertainty when creating a carbon offsetting program,

19:52.680 --> 19:57.160
but Wren has worked to reduce the risks that uncertainty poses by only allowing Offset3

19:57.160 --> 20:01.360
a portfolio of their eight active projects, meaning if one fails, the others are still

20:01.360 --> 20:03.120
there to keep the average stable.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.840
That also means they're able to fund projects that certainly have an impact, but are tougher

20:06.840 --> 20:07.840
to quantify.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.040
For example, their Carbon180 project funds political advocacy for other projects and

20:12.040 --> 20:16.240
policies that will curb carbon emissions, which could be incredibly effective, but is

20:16.240 --> 20:20.200
obviously high risk and tough to quantify compared to a more traditional project like

20:20.200 --> 20:22.960
producing and distributing clean cooking fuel to refugees.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.960
I can't possibly explain all the methods Wren uses to assure the effectiveness of what

20:26.960 --> 20:30.980
they do, but they do a really impressive job of explaining it in an understandable way,

20:30.980 --> 20:34.400
so I'd encourage you to dig into their website until you're satisfied.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.600
So if you want to offset your carbon footprint, make sure it's effective and do it with

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
Wren.
