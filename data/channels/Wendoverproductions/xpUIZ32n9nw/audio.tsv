0	5440	Tesla has never been good at building cars.
5440	10760	Even before deliveries began, forums sparked up with concerns over the Tesla Roadster's
10760	12320	panel alignment.
12320	16800	Since then, as the cars hit the road and the company shot skyward, complaints about Model
16800	21600	Ss with windows that leak when it rains or mispositioned wire looms, and Model Xs with
21600	26200	drooping window seals or mysterious rattles when reaching speed have become commonplace.
26200	31000	When the Model 3 started rolling off the lots, the feedback was more of the same.
31000	35880	The car was exciting and mostly great, it just wasn't built great.
35880	41160	Condensation fogged headlights, interior paneling popped off, exterior pieces were misaligned,
41160	45520	paint jobs were inconsistent, and some seals failed to hold while others were drowned in
45520	46520	adhesives.
46520	51440	No matter the year, the model, or the factory of origin, buying a new Tesla has always been
51440	55560	a roll of a dice where the bad rolls have been laid out on Twitter.
55560	60440	Of course, social media posts are inherently anecdotal in nature, but Tesla's struggle
60440	65280	to deliver a consistent product goes beyond outraged individuals.
65280	69180	Scroll YouTube's results for Tesla build quality, and the search will populate far
69180	72440	more videos offering negative feedback than positive.
72440	76760	Or take this poll on Tesla's subreddit, where a majority of all respondents reported
76760	79880	at least minor or cosmetic issues with their vehicle.
79880	84040	While Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit may all have a bias towards negativity, you can take
84040	88900	it from the man himself, Elon Musk, who admitted that the company's build quality waned when
88900	90880	production ramped up.
90880	95000	Or for perhaps the most objective stance of all, there's the Consumer Reports annual
95000	101640	reliability rankings, where Tesla placed second to last in 2021, and 19th out of 24 manufacturers
101640	103400	in 2022.
103400	108520	The company simply struggles to deliver consistent, reliable, well-assembled vehicles.
108520	112160	It's been a problem since the beginning, it's been a problem the company has sought
112160	116740	to address time and time again, and it's been a problem that's taken different forms
116740	117740	over the years.
117740	122160	But it's not a problem Tesla's tried to hide—it's not a deep, dirty secret, but
122160	125080	rather something that comes with the territory.
125080	129080	Tesla has lacked the consistency of legacy car manufacturers.
129080	133980	After all, they aren't a legacy car manufacturer—they're the plucky upstart, the company that's been
133980	138520	bent on changing the world, the company that's moved fast and broke stuff.
138520	142600	The side effect's been inconsistent products, but from the perspective of the consumer,
142600	146600	what's one minor rattle or subtle paint problem when you're leading the charge towards
146600	151660	a brighter, bolder, greener, gasless future, right?
151660	156680	But even after building the car, Tesla struggles with a step that customers never even knew
156680	158600	could go sideways.
158600	163440	If Tesla's bad at building cars, then they're at best hit or miss when it comes to delivering
163440	164440	them.
164480	169980	At certain points, when favorable conditions exist, Tesla delivery has been more than punctual.
169980	174280	In the case of the Model Y at the end of 2022, slack in demand and increasing production
174280	178900	capacity at Tesla's Texas factory shrunk delivery times to a matter of weeks, but for
178900	182560	every November of 2022, there's a September of 2018.
182560	187360	By the middle of that year, long after Tesla announced the arrival of the sedan-style Model
187360	192500	3, and after some 450,000 eager customers had put down deposits for the vehicle, the
192500	196820	company was way behind, only having delivered around 10,000.
196820	202740	By September, Musk described Tesla's predicament as delivery logistics hell, but to be at the
202740	207700	bleeding edge of what feels like a revolutionary purchase, Tesla buyers are generally willing
207700	208700	to wait.
208700	213640	In fact, as the delivery problems mounted, some of the brands most loyal offered to volunteer
213640	217060	at delivery centers and help with customer service.
217060	222060	What Tesla customers didn't like, however, was being left to wait in the dark, or worse,
222060	223640	feeling misled.
223640	226780	Some of those who were once happy to wait showed up at delivery centers for their new
226780	230380	Model 3, only to find that there wasn't one waiting for them, or that it had been
230380	235280	damaged in shipping, or that they had been mistaken for someone with the same first name.
235280	239100	Others excitedly waited for their delivery deadline, only to receive a call just days
239100	241980	before that there would be another delay.
241980	246020	Some of the scorn demanded refunds, others went to Twitter searching for answers when
246020	249060	they couldn't get through to anyone at Tesla.
249060	251820	Many let the experience shape their opinion.
251820	256460	Now, ultimately, Tesla pulled itself out of the hole it dug, and the exasperated early
256460	258580	adopters finally got their cars.
258580	263020	But the problems persist—buyers still check in on their delivery date only to see that
263020	267020	it's been bumped back a month, customers save their get-ready-for-delivery-in-two-weeks
267020	271540	notices only for them to start piling up in their inbox, and the frustrated still ask
271540	275940	what's going on over Twitter because that's the easiest means of getting an answer.
275940	280660	Frustrations have also expanded beyond the labyrinth-like buying process too—not only
280660	285420	are Teslas more numerous than ever, some of them are now a decade old.
285420	290280	As it's become common to see Teslas almost anywhere nationwide, the company only established
290280	294080	163 service centers spread across the US.
294080	299900	That means if you own a Tesla in Flagstaff, Arizona, you're about 150 miles or 240 kilometers
299900	303240	away from anyone certified to work on your vehicle.
303240	308340	If you live in Wichita, Kansas, your nearest options are all a state border and a two-hour
308340	309880	drive away.
309880	314240	Making things more difficult, service centers are low on loaner vehicles, so getting from
314240	319400	Phoenix back to Flagstaff or Kansas City to Wichita requires a creative application of
319400	321920	Tesla-supplied Uber vouchers.
321920	326220	Even as the company continues to expand its mobile service fleet, the growth of the service
326220	331040	team is being outpaced by the total number of Teslas hitting American roads.
331040	336480	So, whether stationary or mobile, Tesla's service capabilities are being overwhelmed.
336480	341560	What were once appointment wait times numbered in days have become numbered in weeks that
341560	344200	are increasingly liable to cancel.
344200	349400	Tesla's driving functions are reliable—an inherent plus of the electric drivetrain—but
349400	351720	everything else is clearly not.
351720	356680	So facing inconvenient service, Tesla owners just wait, listening to their rattles, air
356680	361640	tones, and wind squeals for years, feeling increasingly fleeced by the company that demanded
361640	366160	luxury car prices for something that looks nice but feels cheap.
366160	372720	So, the company is burning through their existing customers—a group most likely to buy future
372720	377540	Teslas—which is certainly a problem, but perhaps even more concerningly, it's tough
377540	381180	to understand what they're doing to attract new ones.
381180	385320	It hardly seems like it's by offering them a deal—compare a Model Y Long Range to a
385320	390160	Mustang Mach-E Premium, and it has slightly better acceleration, slightly longer range,
390160	392520	but a slightly higher price.
392520	396000	As far as distinguishable differences go, there are a few.
396000	401760	It's a similar story upmarket with the Model S—the lucid air nearly matches on acceleration,
401760	405720	beats it on range, and is close enough in price that few in this market segment would
405720	406720	bat an eye.
406720	411440	And then if you go all the way to the other side of the market, Tesla is bested by Chevrolet,
411440	417920	whose base model Bull EV starts for some $15,000 less than the base Model 3, while coming close
417920	418920	on many specs.
418920	424080	So, it's clear that Tesla is not trying to compete based on price, so it's probably
424080	425700	something else.
425700	430320	Maybe it's by offering something different—maybe they're trying to entice the market by offering
430320	433960	a vehicle that nobody else does, but everybody else wants.
433960	438840	Well, while unique in their minimalistic design, the broad strokes of Tesla's product lineup
438840	441340	is uniquely basic.
441340	447540	Upmarket sedan, mid-market SUV, upmarket sedan, upmarket SUV—that's it.
447540	452380	Bafflingly, Tesla had the opportunity to differentiate its product lineup, and it recognized how
452380	457900	massive an opportunity doing so would be, but then just didn't.
457900	462500	Year after year after year, it's never been a surprise who will top the list of American
462500	463620	vehicle sales.
463620	464900	It's the Ford F-Series.
464900	467600	It's always the Ford F-Series.
467600	474120	In Kansas or Texas or Louisiana, the pickup represents about one of every 20 new car sales.
474120	479520	In Wyoming, it's more like one in 16, while up in Montana, one in every 13 new cars is
479520	481240	a Ford F-150.
481240	485780	These pickups are just so popular, and the only vehicles that even come close to their
485780	491120	sales figures are close equivalents like the Chevy Silverado or Ram trucks.
491120	495580	Americans just love their pickups, and the market is uniquely consolidated compared to
495580	500740	other vehicle types, so recognizing this, a decade ago, Musk announced Tesla would go
500740	506660	after the F-150 with an EV equivalent—a prime opportunity to disrupt a vulnerable
506660	508420	market.
508420	512820	Six years after that, Ford announced they'd just build an electric version of the F-150.
512820	517860	Three years after that, it entered production, and today, there are thousands of F-150 Lightnings
517860	521820	on the road and exactly zero Tesla pickups.
521860	526620	Adding to the woes, the F-150 was merely joining a market already kicked off by the Hummer
526620	532100	EV and Rivian R1T, meaning there are three manufacturers already in production, working
532100	536460	out the kinks, ramping up to massive scale in 2023.
536460	540420	Even the earliest possible Tesla Cybertruck production dates will therefore compete against
540420	544820	at least three major entrenched mature competitors.
544820	549420	Plenty have criticized far more about the Tesla Cybertruck concept, speculating that
549420	553700	consumers will shirk its audacious shape, that regulators will reject its innovative
553700	558100	design, that component costs will make its purported price impossible.
558100	562340	That could all be true—in fact, considering Musk himself admitted the company did zero
562340	567120	market research for the vehicle, it more likely is—but perhaps the most crucial critique
567120	571020	of the vehicle is the fact that it doesn't yet exist.
571020	573620	First moves matter.
573620	577900	Consumers can read a review about the Lightning, take a Rivian on a test drive, even walk up
577900	582780	to a dealer and buy a Hummer EV today, while the Cybertruck is relegated to the More tab
582780	588140	of Tesla's website, featuring absolutely zero specifications or even prices—merely
588140	593780	the option to leave a $100 refundable deposit for the chance to get in line to buy the vehicle
593780	596300	once it finally exists.
596300	599940	While the devoted few will maintain that the Cybertruck will change the game, it would
599940	605020	have been far easier for Tesla to define the game—years ago, when it first recognized
605020	608340	the opportunity that it later squandered.
608340	611420	But maybe they're not trying to compete on cost, and maybe they're not trying to
611420	613620	compete on differentiation.
613620	615740	Maybe China is the answer.
615740	620460	Tesla believed that enough to cozy up at the CCP and open a factory in Shanghai, largely
620460	625020	to produce cars for the Chinese market itself, and this has gone decently.
625020	629220	They sell tens of thousands of vehicles to the country each month, accounting for about
629220	634140	40% of the company's total sales, but in the largest EV market in the world, Tesla
634140	637220	is not the largest EV manufacturer.
637220	638900	That's BYD.
638900	643980	No company globally produces more EVs—they are now bigger than Tesla from a volume perspective—but
643980	646400	that's not the most staggering part.
646400	647400	This is.
647400	650460	Their growth rate is ferocious.
650460	652340	And here's Tesla's.
652340	657780	It is famously difficult for Western companies to sustainably compete in the Chinese market.
657780	664900	Amazon failed, Uber failed, Airbnb failed, Google, Best Buy, Home Depot, Macy's, eBay,
664900	665900	Yahoo.
665900	669380	It's harder to find one that did work than didn't.
669380	673100	China is just such an immense market that there are equivalent quality alternatives
673100	677540	to Western products that are better suited to the needs and wants of Chinese consumers,
677540	680460	which leave Western managers dumbfounded.
680460	683940	They don't understand why they're getting beat, and that's the point.
683940	686000	They don't understand.
686000	690240	Chinese companies are able to fulfill the tiny, unique, nuanced preferences of Chinese
690240	695500	consumers better than foreigners, so in Tesla's case, inevitably, their vehicles are going
695500	699800	to be worse for Chinese consumers than the homegrown alternatives, and unless they succeed
699800	705540	where almost all their equivalents have failed, they just won't be able to understand why.
705540	710960	Foreign-made vehicles do sell in China, but primarily as luxury goods—selling American-ness
710960	716320	or German-ness or British-ness as a brand—rather than competing on the merits of the vehicles
716320	717320	themselves.
717320	721760	That means that China can be a massive market for Tesla, but they'll struggle to go mass-market.
721760	729720	They'll always be a secondary player, meaning it might not be a market worth betting on.
729720	734660	So maybe it's not price, not differentiation, not market, not any of the traditional ways
734660	736720	that companies gain an edge.
736720	737720	Maybe it's innovation.
738120	742880	In 2016, after being dropped by its previous autonomous partner over safety concerns, Tesla
742880	747140	charted a new vision for full self-driving, and quickly started selling a software package
747140	751820	referred to as full self-driving for $3,000 soon after.
751820	755160	But full self-driving didn't exactly mean full self-driving.
755160	761000	Rather, it meant adaptive cruise control, auto steer, auto lane change, auto park, traffic
761000	765060	light recognition, and a few other driver assist features depending on street type,
765220	770920	each requiring driver intervention to manage and monitor, but not full self-driving.
770920	772500	Not yet.
772500	776540	Musk said that would probably come in 2017, when the vehicle would be able to drive coast-to-coast
776540	780540	from LA to New York without a single human touch, not even for charging.
780540	782080	That didn't happen.
782080	789240	It also didn't happen in 2018, or 2019, or 2020, or 2021 either, and all the while,
789240	793580	Musk and Tesla salespeople, following orders, pressured consumers into paying for the software
793580	797820	upgrade, telling them to get it now before the price would rise, which it did, all the
797820	805780	way to $15,000, despite the fact that, still today, Teslas are not capable of full self-driving.
805780	811820	There's now an open beta for something closer to true full self-driving, but far away from
811820	814820	that vision of touchless trips from LA to New York.
814820	819460	It's erratic and imperfect, in a way that requires a significant degree of human oversight
819460	823100	and intervention to avoid becoming a liability on the road.
823140	827820	Arguably, right now, it's more trouble than it's worth, but the issue for Tesla is less
827820	830420	about whether its full self-driving works.
830420	835340	It's that, for the better part of a decade now, it sold consumers on the promise, failed
835340	841780	to deliver, made new promises, failed to deliver, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.
841780	846420	The type of autonomous that was promised will be game-changing, so the sales pitch worked,
846420	851740	but once again, the company has burned through its most promising customer base—existing
851740	853460	owners.
853460	857540	Tesla is facing class-action lawsuits and Department of Justice investigations over
857540	862060	its autonomous program, but even if those lead to nothing, even if it's navigated
862060	867760	strategic ambiguity properly to legally mislead, the reputation Tesla has earned as a company
867760	871780	whose word means nothing has to have an impact.
871780	877980	Okay, so, not price, not differentiation, not market, not innovation—maybe it's
877980	878980	Musk?
879180	883100	Maybe his call to personality is so strong that consumers will buy the vehicle specifically
883100	885220	because it's his?
885220	886220	Maybe he's the brand?
886220	890780	In fact, maybe he's deliberately calibrating his public image to appeal to a demographic
890780	895580	less likely to buy an EV, strengthening that fledgling consumer segment for the company.
895580	899340	Well, if that's what's happening, it's not working.
899340	904100	According to a morning consult survey, Tesla's net favorability among Democrats plummeted
904100	909540	by 20.3% between October and November 2022, when Musk purchased Twitter and started making
909540	912980	a series of controversial changes and statements.
912980	917420	Among Republicans, the favorability actually increased, but only by 3.9%.
917420	922380	That's not nearly enough to make the move worth it for Tesla, because Republicans don't
922380	927460	buy EVs—only 25% of them said they would even consider them in the next year, while
927460	929820	44% of Democrats did.
929860	934140	So, if you make the very simple assumption that a company's favorability correlates
934140	940660	to its shares, Elon Musk's actions objectively reduced Tesla's sales and took money out
940660	942940	of its shareholders' pockets.
942940	948220	While Musk might have been the visionary behind the disruptive behemoth, today he's a liability—an
948220	953460	increasingly unlikeable loose cannon who can't seem to separate his image from the company's.
953460	957780	There's not a whole lot left to set Tesla apart.
957780	962260	This isn't an existential threat—it's not like Tesla is going to suddenly start
962260	963260	fading away.
963260	968100	It's still a tremendously large, profitable company with an incredibly passionate fanbase
968100	972140	that will find ways to defend any and all accusations of weakness, and there are clearly
972140	974660	hordes of people that love their vehicles.
974660	978700	But people are learning to love other EVs, too.
978700	984460	Rife with quality issues, poor customer service, broken promises, and a generally amateur feeling,
984460	989060	consumers are taking the safe route and increasingly opting for the options put forward by the
989060	990900	incumbent manufacturers.
990900	995780	Meanwhile, startups like Rivian are looking at Tesla's shortcomings and addressing them,
995780	999660	offering better quality, better customer support, and better communication.
999660	1004940	So, Tesla's just sitting there, preying on their downfall, letting market share just
1004940	1007060	march out the front door.
1007060	1010780	Tesla's competitive advantage was built on scarcity.
1010780	1015680	For most of their history, they were the only legitimate horse in the EV race.
1015680	1019680	Consumers were willing to deal with bad quality and service and communication, because it's
1019680	1023340	the price you have to pay to get something groundbreaking.
1023340	1027340	But Tesla is no longer a startup—it's one of the largest companies in the world,
1027340	1030100	yet it still operates like a startup.
1030100	1036180	Meanwhile, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Rivian, and others are acting as the adults in the room.
1036180	1040620	Company culture is notoriously difficult to change, and that difficulty mounts the larger
1040620	1045100	company becomes, so when you have something as massive as Tesla that is still in startup
1045100	1049260	mentality, it is really hard to understand how that will change.
1049260	1052420	Tesla's fumble is what it could have been.
1052420	1057180	They had a decade-head start on the burgeoning industry that, within decades, will just be
1057180	1059500	known as the auto industry.
1059500	1062340	They could have been the auto manufacturer.
1062340	1063340	They could have been a giant.
1063340	1066700	They could have been Ford, GM, and Chrysler.
1066700	1069300	But instead, the other EVs are here.
1069300	1073980	They're popular, they're competitive, and while Tesla keeps making excuses, breaking
1073980	1078900	promises, burning bridges, and swinging wildly for the fences to keep the hope alive, everyone
1078900	1083980	else is slowly and methodically chipping away.
1083980	1085820	Maybe Tesla succeeds.
1085820	1090020	Maybe it's able to use its dominant market position to maintain its dominant market position,
1090020	1095040	but what sure is that it's going to be a whole lot harder than it had to be.
1095040	1100620	This day of mature mainstream EV market competition was always going to come, and yet Tesla did
1100620	1104900	little to prepare, and did lots to open up pathways for their competitors to eat into
1104900	1106360	their market share.
1106360	1111880	So if, in ten years, Tesla is anything but the biggest car manufacturer in America, the
1111880	1116120	explanation will likely be less about what it does over the next decade, and more about
1116120	1121780	what it didn't do in the years it squandered, leading up to today.
1121780	1125700	This video sponsors Wren, and some of you may be surprised by that, because Wren is
1125700	1128040	a carbon offsetting provider.
1128040	1132060	Last year I made a video about how the carbon offsetting market is a scam because it incentivizes
1132060	1135420	ineffective offsets that actually increase overall carbon output.
1135420	1139620	That video got a ton of attention, even making it onto Last Week Tonight with John Oliver,
1139620	1142900	meaning it made it all the way to the people behind Wren.
1142900	1147320	Their whole idea is to be a carbon offsetting provider that has the greatest chance of actually
1147320	1148320	working.
1148880	1152240	Now, I want to be careful to say that I'm not encouraging anyone to carbon offset.
1152240	1156020	I think that's really down to you, because at the end of the day, carbon offsetting is
1156020	1158480	not going to solve climate change.
1158480	1162920	Only top-down legislative action can do that, but if you, like me, want to do everything
1162920	1166920	possible to reduce the likelihood that your life is perpetuating the problem, then Wren
1166920	1170220	is probably the best offsetter to use.
1170220	1174520	Before even considering taking a sponsorship, I got on the phone with their CEO, had a project
1174520	1178120	evaluation, and a few others from their leadership team, and grilled them with questions for
1178120	1182240	more than an hour about how their project evaluation process works, why they pick the
1182240	1186480	projects they do, what they do if a project goes wrong, and they had really thoughtful,
1186480	1188640	detailed, upfront answers to everything.
1188640	1192680	Inherently, there's always going to be uncertainty when creating a carbon offsetting program,
1192680	1197160	but Wren has worked to reduce the risks that uncertainty poses by only allowing Offset3
1197160	1201360	a portfolio of their eight active projects, meaning if one fails, the others are still
1201360	1203120	there to keep the average stable.
1203120	1206840	That also means they're able to fund projects that certainly have an impact, but are tougher
1206840	1207840	to quantify.
1207840	1212040	For example, their Carbon180 project funds political advocacy for other projects and
1212040	1216240	policies that will curb carbon emissions, which could be incredibly effective, but is
1216240	1220200	obviously high risk and tough to quantify compared to a more traditional project like
1220200	1222960	producing and distributing clean cooking fuel to refugees.
1222960	1226960	I can't possibly explain all the methods Wren uses to assure the effectiveness of what
1226960	1230980	they do, but they do a really impressive job of explaining it in an understandable way,
1230980	1234400	so I'd encourage you to dig into their website until you're satisfied.
1234400	1238600	So if you want to offset your carbon footprint, make sure it's effective and do it with
1238600	1239600	Wren.
