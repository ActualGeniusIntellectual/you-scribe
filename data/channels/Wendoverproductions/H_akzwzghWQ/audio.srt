00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,800
The airline business model is broken.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:18,600
Back in late 2019, COVID-19 came along.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,020
Borders worldwide closed down.

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,840
Businesses halted work travel.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,420
All but a select few individuals cancelled their trips.

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,740
In the time when all but the most critical contact was to be avoided to hold the virus

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,660
at bay, travel was just not a risk worth taking for most.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,780
One of the most major issues for the airline industry, though, is not that demand is lower.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,700
Lower demand is bad—it's wreaking havoc on the industry—but it is a potentially

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,320
surmountable problem.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:57,620
If an airline knew that 2020 would be 75% down, 2021 55% down, and 2022 30% down, the

14
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,380
solution would be simple—they'd downsize their schedule, cut back on routes, unload

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:07,800
assets for low employees, and just become a smaller airline for the next few years.

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,980
These are, in fact, the tactics airlines are using regardless, but they don't fully solve

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,320
the overall problem.

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,940
That's because, even after airlines solved the problem of being too big for what the

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,820
travel market has become, the true issue—the one that will plague the industry for the

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,280
entirety of its period of recovery—is that even after they downsize, they just don't

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,380
know how many people want to fly.

22
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,720
Now, think back to travel in the time before coronavirus.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,460
How full were the planes you were on?

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,140
How often was that seat next to you free?

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,580
The answer is almost certainly sometimes, but not that often.

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:52,460
On average, 85% of airplane seats in the US were filled in 2019—slightly higher than

27
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,820
the world average of 83%.

28
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:02,180
Some airlines achieved even better than this—Ryanair, for example, filled 96% of its seats in 2019.

29
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:08,160
Now, simultaneously, when was the last time that you've gone to buy a ticket for a flight,

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,200
but there were none available?

31
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,080
This too certainly happens, but it's quite rare.

32
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,600
It might cost quite a lot, but if you want to buy a ticket to a flight, it'll almost

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,180
always be available, no matter how close to departure it is.

34
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,680
This is very, very intentional.

35
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,000
Now, normally, the day-to-day job of adjusting the price of flights to extract every potential

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,120
dollar out of them is handled by computers—specifically, the complex revenue management software on

37
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
them.

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,100
Around early March 2020, though, the computers started to go haywire.

39
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,380
People weren't booking like they were supposed to, so the computers lowered the price.

40
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,400
That should lead to bookings picking up, but they didn't, which confused the computers

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,740
even more, which lowered the price further.

42
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,420
This went on and on and on until the point where you could book flights from New York

43
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,060
to London, for example, for just one or two hundred dollars round trip, hours before departure.

44
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,420
It'd be easy to say prices were low because demand was, but that's not exactly the truth—it's

45
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,880
just a byproduct of the truth.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,820
The computers and their revenue management software were tasked to extract the most revenue

47
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,860
possible, regardless of demand, but in this case, they failed.

48
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,520
Now, normally, businesses focus more on matching supply to demand, not demand to supply, because

49
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,860
regulating demand is very, very difficult.

50
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,100
Airlines, however, do both simultaneously.

51
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,340
This is because they just can't regulate supply to match demand that well.

52
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,880
Demand for travel fluctuates depending on which hour of which day of which year it is.

53
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,400
Airlines just can't fluctuate their schedule to match that entirely.

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,700
For example, airlines in the US making their 2020 schedules knew that last year, 2,487,398

55
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:07,740
people traveled in the US on the second Thursday in April, while 2,616,158 people did on the

56
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,280
third Thursday.

57
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,460
For the most part, though, airlines will operate the same schedules on both of those Thursdays.

58
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:20,120
That's because the complexity of adjusting the schedule to such small changes just isn't

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,860
worth the money it would save by operating slightly fuller flights.

60
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:29,940
Therefore, rather than rapidly adjusting supply to match demand, they rapidly adjust demand

61
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,720
to fit supply.

62
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,320
You can see this in action by looking at travel trends.

63
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,820
In the US, the least busy quarter in 2019 for air travel was the first, January, February,

64
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
and March, with 210 million passengers.

65
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,400
The most busy quarter, meanwhile, was the third, July, August, and September, with 243

66
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,400
million passengers.

67
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,580
Now, that's not that much of a difference.

68
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,040
The third quarter, including the height of the summer travel season, was only 16% busier

69
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,840
than the first quarter, encompassing the depths of winter.

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,380
But is it truly that demand is only 16% higher in the summer than winter, or is it that airlines

71
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,240
are regulating demand to increase it in the winter and suppress it in the summer?

72
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,720
All evidence points to the latter.

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,440
So, airlines have this balancing act to perform.

74
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,400
They want to be sure that they can capture as much of the high demand in the summer as

75
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,360
possible, but they also don't want to have a bunch of planes and staff sitting around

76
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,180
in the lower demand winter, as that costs quite a lot.

77
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,220
Rather than flying a stable number of flights year-round or regulating demand to keep it

78
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:40,820
stable year-round, they do a little of both and meet in the middle.

79
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,580
The supply side is the easy bit.

80
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,940
There is a certain predictable ebb and flow to the yearly cycle of travel for a given

81
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,800
market for a given type of traveler.

82
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,400
For example, take the American business traveler.

83
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,260
Airlines know that the week with the lowest demand for travel from this demographic is

84
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,820
the last of the year, after Christmas, followed by the first of the year, the second to last

85
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,000
of the year, the week of the 4th of July, then the week of Thanksgiving.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,260
With this info, airlines can craft a schedule that, over those weeks, emphasizes leisure-focused

87
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,500
destinations over business ones.

88
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,780
They might decide that, in the last week of the year, they'll fly more flights to Florida

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,420
and fewer to Chicago.

90
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,660
Simultaneously, though, airlines know that September, October, and the week before Thanksgiving

91
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,560
are the strongest period of the year for business travel, so they might increase the

92
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,220
number of flights on common business routes over that time.

93
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:38,520
So, airlines tweak their schedule mostly on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis, but

94
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,260
for those day-to-day or hour-to-hour shifts in demand, they rely on regulating demand.

95
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,820
The number one tool used to do this is pricing, and we can see this in action.

96
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,160
Currently, if you want to book a ticket to fly United Airlines from Newark to Eagle County

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,640
Airport in Colorado on January 1st, 2021, it would cost you $353.

98
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,500
If you were to book United Airlines from Newark Airport to Denver International Airport on

99
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,320
January 1st, though, it would cost you $134.

100
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,440
So, flying to Eagle County is two and a half times more expensive than flying to Denver,

101
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,280
even though it is only 120 miles further from New York.

102
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,020
To United, the cost of operating these two flights are nearly identical—it's the

103
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,720
same aircraft type and roughly the same flight length.

104
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,980
There might be slight economies of scale by flying to Denver as it's a bigger airport,

105
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:35,740
and there's a greater potential of a flight diversion at Eagle County Airport since it's

106
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,360
in the mountains, but overall, the costs are very similar.

107
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,940
What accounts for the difference in price is demand, not cost.

108
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,340
United Airlines thinks it knows that four months prior to the flight, it can charge

109
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,020
$353 for the flight to Eagle County and still end up with a full plane.

110
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:01,340
Meanwhile, to end up with a full plane to Denver, it has to price it at $134.

111
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,340
These prices will increase as it gets closer to departure, but just because of the way

112
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:12,860
people book their travel to Eagle County Airport, $353 is the right price right now.

113
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,940
So, how does United know this?

114
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,820
Well, because it's what it did last year, and it worked.

115
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,660
Airlines' greatest asset truly is their data.

116
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,900
United Airlines knows exactly how much they need to price their flights at a certain level

117
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,360
of fullness and a certain number of days before departure, and that means they can eke out

118
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,300
every single bit of potential revenue from a given flight.

119
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,940
If United priced the Eagle County flight too high, they might end up with empty seats,

120
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,400
which is terrible for an airline.

121
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,840
Every time a plane takes off with an empty seat, the airline is losing out on potential

122
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,840
revenue.

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,640
Aside from taxes, airport fees, and catering costs, there's essentially no extra cost

124
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,280
to carrying an additional passenger, so selling a cheap ticket over no ticket is always worth

125
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
it.

126
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,460
Simultaneously, though, if an airline prices a flight too low, they might sell out of seats

127
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,520
too early—losing out on the potential to sell high-priced tickets to last-minute travelers,

128
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,960
who generally are those traveling for work who aren't paying for themselves.

129
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,840
So, airlines rely on these price fluctuations to end up with a plane exactly full, exactly

130
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,120
at departure, therefore, in theory, extracting the exact highest potential level of revenue

131
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,060
from the flight.

132
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,600
This makes the problem rather obvious—airlines simply don't know what their recovery will

133
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,720
look like.

134
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
Specifically, the computers don't know how people will respond to changes in pricing,

135
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,160
so they don't know how to extract the most possible revenue from a flight by ending up

136
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,740
with an exactly full flight, exactly at departure.

137
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,840
The airline industry has had sharp drop-offs in demand before, but typically only in response

138
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,880
to financial crises or terrorist attacks.

139
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:00,720
In this case, in a pandemic, the closest equivalent happened 100 years ago, in 1918, when the

140
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,120
commercial aviation industry was only in its infancy.

141
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,480
Therefore, the aviation industry as a whole, and especially individual airlines, have no

142
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,840
data and no idea what the demand patterns during and after a pandemic will be like.

143
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,720
After the initial drop-off in travel and the plummet in pricing in response, airlines essentially

144
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,600
turned off the computers—shut down the revenue management algorithms.

145
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,120
They've gone back to relying on the humans, who traditionally are only there to tweak

146
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,560
what the computer thinks.

147
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,840
That's because the humans were able to realize something that the computers could not.

148
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,400
Traditionally, airline demand is quite elastic.

149
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,100
People will often decide whether or not to book based on the price.

150
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,840
It is exactly this, in fact, that makes it possible for the airlines to regulate demand

151
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,420
by changing prices.

152
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,580
In the midst of the initial stay-at-home orders, though, the only type of person who would

153
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,400
fly was someone who needed to fly—someone who would pay whatever it cost to get that

154
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
ticket.

155
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,680
Therefore, there was no sense in lowering prices because that wouldn't stimulate demand—it

156
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,600
would only reduce revenue.

157
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,880
They also didn't jack them up tremendously, cautious not to get into the public relations

158
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,600
nightmare of price gouging, but they more or less just kept them stable to what a normal

159
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,120
April would look like.

160
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,360
As May came about, and there was a small initial restart to discretionary travel, most every

161
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,120
American airline lowered prices by about 10-20% to stimulate demand slightly.

162
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,720
The problem, though, is that there are still way too many variables impacting travel to

163
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,720
accurately predict and stimulate demand.

164
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,160
American Airlines, for example, took a big gamble in May when they were crafting their

165
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,080
revised summer schedule.

166
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,880
They accurately surmised that people who were vacationing in summer 2020 would be particularly

167
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,940
interested in destinations where the focus was the outdoors, such as at the beach.

168
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,180
They also knew that many of the traditional beach destinations that Americans travel to

169
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,400
in the Caribbean would be shut behind closed borders, so demand for this type of vacation

170
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,640
would naturally shift domestically to Florida.

171
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,720
This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that, in May, when they were working

172
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,320
on this schedule, Florida had one of the lowest rates of infection in the US.

173
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,600
Therefore, the airline decided to add loads of capacity into Florida to account for the

174
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,200
relatively high demand it expected.

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,720
Of course, starting in early June, there began a steep spike in the state's COVID cases,

176
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,560
leading to increased weariness among consumers to travel to the state.

177
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,600
Also, on a more general level, much of the summer travel season in the US did not live

178
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,760
up to airlines' expectations due to a second spike in nationwide case numbers and increasing

179
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,040
domestic travel restrictions.

180
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,360
Passenger demand trends returned slightly closer to the April 2020 scenario, where it

181
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,600
was less and less the cost of travel that stimulated demand, and rather external conditions.

182
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,600
COVID has turned the job of those in revenue management at airlines closer to an art than

183
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,920
a science.

184
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,920
With decades upon decades of data, airlines got good at modeling the predictable patterns

185
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,560
of travelers, but failed to consider the possibility for the unimaginable.

186
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:14,840
Now, not only is overall demand lower, but airlines can't even extract the same level

187
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,120
of revenue from the same number of travelers on a given flight.

188
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,600
This unpredictability has a quite literal, monetary cost for airlines, so that means

189
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,760
that, even when the travelers come back, even when the airports are full again, true recovery

190
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,180
will not happen until passengers are predictable again.

191
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,240
Uncertainty is not just a word.

192
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,960
It's a force of nature that we can never get rid of, which is why mathematics has set

193
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,340
up a system of tools to address it.

194
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,960
The mathematics of uncertainty is fascinating and an incredibly powerful analytical tool,

195
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,440
but it's an area of math that most people don't know a lot about.

196
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,560
I certainly didn't until the new brilliant course on knowledge and uncertainty came around.

for you, as you'll be learning the exact sort of math that those working in revenue

204
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,780
management at airlines are using to try to work their way through their massive uncertainty

205
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,780
problem.
