10160	13800	The airline business model is broken.
13800	18600	Back in late 2019, COVID-19 came along.
18600	22020	Borders worldwide closed down.
22020	23840	Businesses halted work travel.
23840	27420	All but a select few individuals cancelled their trips.
27420	31740	In the time when all but the most critical contact was to be avoided to hold the virus
31740	36660	at bay, travel was just not a risk worth taking for most.
36660	42780	One of the most major issues for the airline industry, though, is not that demand is lower.
42780	47700	Lower demand is bad—it's wreaking havoc on the industry—but it is a potentially
47700	49320	surmountable problem.
49320	57620	If an airline knew that 2020 would be 75% down, 2021 55% down, and 2022 30% down, the
57620	62380	solution would be simple—they'd downsize their schedule, cut back on routes, unload
62380	67800	assets for low employees, and just become a smaller airline for the next few years.
67800	72980	These are, in fact, the tactics airlines are using regardless, but they don't fully solve
72980	74320	the overall problem.
74320	78940	That's because, even after airlines solved the problem of being too big for what the
78940	83820	travel market has become, the true issue—the one that will plague the industry for the
83820	89280	entirety of its period of recovery—is that even after they downsize, they just don't
89280	92380	know how many people want to fly.
92380	96720	Now, think back to travel in the time before coronavirus.
96720	99460	How full were the planes you were on?
99460	102140	How often was that seat next to you free?
102140	106580	The answer is almost certainly sometimes, but not that often.
106580	112460	On average, 85% of airplane seats in the US were filled in 2019—slightly higher than
112460	114820	the world average of 83%.
114820	122180	Some airlines achieved even better than this—Ryanair, for example, filled 96% of its seats in 2019.
122180	128160	Now, simultaneously, when was the last time that you've gone to buy a ticket for a flight,
128160	130200	but there were none available?
130200	134080	This too certainly happens, but it's quite rare.
134080	138600	It might cost quite a lot, but if you want to buy a ticket to a flight, it'll almost
138600	143180	always be available, no matter how close to departure it is.
143180	145680	This is very, very intentional.
145680	151000	Now, normally, the day-to-day job of adjusting the price of flights to extract every potential
151000	157120	dollar out of them is handled by computers—specifically, the complex revenue management software on
157120	158120	them.
158120	163100	Around early March 2020, though, the computers started to go haywire.
163100	167380	People weren't booking like they were supposed to, so the computers lowered the price.
167380	171400	That should lead to bookings picking up, but they didn't, which confused the computers
171400	174740	even more, which lowered the price further.
174740	179420	This went on and on and on until the point where you could book flights from New York
179420	185060	to London, for example, for just one or two hundred dollars round trip, hours before departure.
185060	191420	It'd be easy to say prices were low because demand was, but that's not exactly the truth—it's
191420	193880	just a byproduct of the truth.
193880	198820	The computers and their revenue management software were tasked to extract the most revenue
198820	203860	possible, regardless of demand, but in this case, they failed.
203860	210520	Now, normally, businesses focus more on matching supply to demand, not demand to supply, because
210520	213860	regulating demand is very, very difficult.
213860	218100	Airlines, however, do both simultaneously.
218100	223340	This is because they just can't regulate supply to match demand that well.
223340	228880	Demand for travel fluctuates depending on which hour of which day of which year it is.
228880	232400	Airlines just can't fluctuate their schedule to match that entirely.
232400	240700	For example, airlines in the US making their 2020 schedules knew that last year, 2,487,398
240700	247740	people traveled in the US on the second Thursday in April, while 2,616,158 people did on the
247740	249280	third Thursday.
249280	254460	For the most part, though, airlines will operate the same schedules on both of those Thursdays.
254460	260120	That's because the complexity of adjusting the schedule to such small changes just isn't
260120	263860	worth the money it would save by operating slightly fuller flights.
263860	269940	Therefore, rather than rapidly adjusting supply to match demand, they rapidly adjust demand
269940	271720	to fit supply.
271720	275320	You can see this in action by looking at travel trends.
275320	280820	In the US, the least busy quarter in 2019 for air travel was the first, January, February,
280820	283820	and March, with 210 million passengers.
283820	289400	The most busy quarter, meanwhile, was the third, July, August, and September, with 243
289400	290400	million passengers.
290400	294580	Now, that's not that much of a difference.
294580	300040	The third quarter, including the height of the summer travel season, was only 16% busier
300040	303840	than the first quarter, encompassing the depths of winter.
303840	309380	But is it truly that demand is only 16% higher in the summer than winter, or is it that airlines
309380	314240	are regulating demand to increase it in the winter and suppress it in the summer?
314240	316720	All evidence points to the latter.
316720	320440	So, airlines have this balancing act to perform.
320440	324400	They want to be sure that they can capture as much of the high demand in the summer as
324400	328360	possible, but they also don't want to have a bunch of planes and staff sitting around
328360	332180	in the lower demand winter, as that costs quite a lot.
332180	336220	Rather than flying a stable number of flights year-round or regulating demand to keep it
336220	340820	stable year-round, they do a little of both and meet in the middle.
340820	343580	The supply side is the easy bit.
343580	347940	There is a certain predictable ebb and flow to the yearly cycle of travel for a given
347940	350800	market for a given type of traveler.
350800	354400	For example, take the American business traveler.
354400	358260	Airlines know that the week with the lowest demand for travel from this demographic is
358260	362820	the last of the year, after Christmas, followed by the first of the year, the second to last
362820	367000	of the year, the week of the 4th of July, then the week of Thanksgiving.
367000	372260	With this info, airlines can craft a schedule that, over those weeks, emphasizes leisure-focused
372260	374500	destinations over business ones.
374500	378780	They might decide that, in the last week of the year, they'll fly more flights to Florida
378780	380420	and fewer to Chicago.
380420	385660	Simultaneously, though, airlines know that September, October, and the week before Thanksgiving
385660	389560	are the strongest period of the year for business travel, so they might increase the
389560	393220	number of flights on common business routes over that time.
393220	398520	So, airlines tweak their schedule mostly on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis, but
398520	405260	for those day-to-day or hour-to-hour shifts in demand, they rely on regulating demand.
405260	410820	The number one tool used to do this is pricing, and we can see this in action.
410820	415160	Currently, if you want to book a ticket to fly United Airlines from Newark to Eagle County
415160	421640	Airport in Colorado on January 1st, 2021, it would cost you $353.
421640	425500	If you were to book United Airlines from Newark Airport to Denver International Airport on
425500	429320	January 1st, though, it would cost you $134.
429320	435440	So, flying to Eagle County is two and a half times more expensive than flying to Denver,
435440	439280	even though it is only 120 miles further from New York.
439280	444020	To United, the cost of operating these two flights are nearly identical—it's the
444020	447720	same aircraft type and roughly the same flight length.
447720	451980	There might be slight economies of scale by flying to Denver as it's a bigger airport,
451980	455740	and there's a greater potential of a flight diversion at Eagle County Airport since it's
455740	460360	in the mountains, but overall, the costs are very similar.
460360	464940	What accounts for the difference in price is demand, not cost.
464940	469340	United Airlines thinks it knows that four months prior to the flight, it can charge
469340	475020	$353 for the flight to Eagle County and still end up with a full plane.
475020	481340	Meanwhile, to end up with a full plane to Denver, it has to price it at $134.
481340	485340	These prices will increase as it gets closer to departure, but just because of the way
485340	492860	people book their travel to Eagle County Airport, $353 is the right price right now.
492860	495940	So, how does United know this?
495940	499820	Well, because it's what it did last year, and it worked.
499820	503660	Airlines' greatest asset truly is their data.
503660	507900	United Airlines knows exactly how much they need to price their flights at a certain level
507900	512360	of fullness and a certain number of days before departure, and that means they can eke out
512360	516300	every single bit of potential revenue from a given flight.
516300	520940	If United priced the Eagle County flight too high, they might end up with empty seats,
520940	523400	which is terrible for an airline.
523400	527840	Every time a plane takes off with an empty seat, the airline is losing out on potential
527840	528840	revenue.
528840	533640	Aside from taxes, airport fees, and catering costs, there's essentially no extra cost
533640	539280	to carrying an additional passenger, so selling a cheap ticket over no ticket is always worth
539280	540280	it.
540280	544460	Simultaneously, though, if an airline prices a flight too low, they might sell out of seats
544460	549520	too early—losing out on the potential to sell high-priced tickets to last-minute travelers,
549520	552960	who generally are those traveling for work who aren't paying for themselves.
553520	558840	So, airlines rely on these price fluctuations to end up with a plane exactly full, exactly
558840	564120	at departure, therefore, in theory, extracting the exact highest potential level of revenue
564120	566060	from the flight.
566060	571600	This makes the problem rather obvious—airlines simply don't know what their recovery will
571600	572720	look like.
572720	577600	Specifically, the computers don't know how people will respond to changes in pricing,
577600	582160	so they don't know how to extract the most possible revenue from a flight by ending up
582160	585740	with an exactly full flight, exactly at departure.
585740	590840	The airline industry has had sharp drop-offs in demand before, but typically only in response
590840	593880	to financial crises or terrorist attacks.
593880	600720	In this case, in a pandemic, the closest equivalent happened 100 years ago, in 1918, when the
600720	604120	commercial aviation industry was only in its infancy.
604120	609480	Therefore, the aviation industry as a whole, and especially individual airlines, have no
609480	615840	data and no idea what the demand patterns during and after a pandemic will be like.
615840	620720	After the initial drop-off in travel and the plummet in pricing in response, airlines essentially
620720	624600	turned off the computers—shut down the revenue management algorithms.
624600	629120	They've gone back to relying on the humans, who traditionally are only there to tweak
629120	630560	what the computer thinks.
630560	635840	That's because the humans were able to realize something that the computers could not.
635840	639400	Traditionally, airline demand is quite elastic.
639400	643100	People will often decide whether or not to book based on the price.
643100	647840	It is exactly this, in fact, that makes it possible for the airlines to regulate demand
647840	649420	by changing prices.
649420	653580	In the midst of the initial stay-at-home orders, though, the only type of person who would
653580	659400	fly was someone who needed to fly—someone who would pay whatever it cost to get that
659400	660400	ticket.
660400	665680	Therefore, there was no sense in lowering prices because that wouldn't stimulate demand—it
665680	667600	would only reduce revenue.
667600	671880	They also didn't jack them up tremendously, cautious not to get into the public relations
671880	676600	nightmare of price gouging, but they more or less just kept them stable to what a normal
676600	678120	April would look like.
678120	683360	As May came about, and there was a small initial restart to discretionary travel, most every
683360	689120	American airline lowered prices by about 10-20% to stimulate demand slightly.
689120	693720	The problem, though, is that there are still way too many variables impacting travel to
693720	696720	accurately predict and stimulate demand.
696720	701160	American Airlines, for example, took a big gamble in May when they were crafting their
701160	703080	revised summer schedule.
703080	707880	They accurately surmised that people who were vacationing in summer 2020 would be particularly
707880	712940	interested in destinations where the focus was the outdoors, such as at the beach.
712940	717180	They also knew that many of the traditional beach destinations that Americans travel to
717180	722400	in the Caribbean would be shut behind closed borders, so demand for this type of vacation
722400	725640	would naturally shift domestically to Florida.
725640	729720	This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that, in May, when they were working
729720	734320	on this schedule, Florida had one of the lowest rates of infection in the US.
734320	738600	Therefore, the airline decided to add loads of capacity into Florida to account for the
738600	741200	relatively high demand it expected.
741200	746720	Of course, starting in early June, there began a steep spike in the state's COVID cases,
746720	750560	leading to increased weariness among consumers to travel to the state.
750560	755600	Also, on a more general level, much of the summer travel season in the US did not live
755600	760760	up to airlines' expectations due to a second spike in nationwide case numbers and increasing
760760	763040	domestic travel restrictions.
763040	767360	Passenger demand trends returned slightly closer to the April 2020 scenario, where it
767360	772600	was less and less the cost of travel that stimulated demand, and rather external conditions.
772600	778600	COVID has turned the job of those in revenue management at airlines closer to an art than
778600	779920	a science.
779920	784920	With decades upon decades of data, airlines got good at modeling the predictable patterns
784920	789560	of travelers, but failed to consider the possibility for the unimaginable.
789560	794840	Now, not only is overall demand lower, but airlines can't even extract the same level
794840	799120	of revenue from the same number of travelers on a given flight.
799120	804600	This unpredictability has a quite literal, monetary cost for airlines, so that means
804600	809760	that, even when the travelers come back, even when the airports are full again, true recovery
809760	816180	will not happen until passengers are predictable again.
816180	818240	Uncertainty is not just a word.
818240	822960	It's a force of nature that we can never get rid of, which is why mathematics has set
822960	825340	up a system of tools to address it.
825340	829960	The mathematics of uncertainty is fascinating and an incredibly powerful analytical tool,
829960	834440	but it's an area of math that most people don't know a lot about.
834440	839560	I certainly didn't until the new brilliant course on knowledge and uncertainty came around.
