00:10.160 --> 00:13.800
The airline business model is broken.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.600
Back in late 2019, COVID-19 came along.

00:18.600 --> 00:22.020
Borders worldwide closed down.

00:22.020 --> 00:23.840
Businesses halted work travel.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.420
All but a select few individuals cancelled their trips.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.740
In the time when all but the most critical contact was to be avoided to hold the virus

00:31.740 --> 00:36.660
at bay, travel was just not a risk worth taking for most.

00:36.660 --> 00:42.780
One of the most major issues for the airline industry, though, is not that demand is lower.

00:42.780 --> 00:47.700
Lower demand is bad—it's wreaking havoc on the industry—but it is a potentially

00:47.700 --> 00:49.320
surmountable problem.

00:49.320 --> 00:57.620
If an airline knew that 2020 would be 75% down, 2021 55% down, and 2022 30% down, the

00:57.620 --> 01:02.380
solution would be simple—they'd downsize their schedule, cut back on routes, unload

01:02.380 --> 01:07.800
assets for low employees, and just become a smaller airline for the next few years.

01:07.800 --> 01:12.980
These are, in fact, the tactics airlines are using regardless, but they don't fully solve

01:12.980 --> 01:14.320
the overall problem.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.940
That's because, even after airlines solved the problem of being too big for what the

01:18.940 --> 01:23.820
travel market has become, the true issue—the one that will plague the industry for the

01:23.820 --> 01:29.280
entirety of its period of recovery—is that even after they downsize, they just don't

01:29.280 --> 01:32.380
know how many people want to fly.

01:32.380 --> 01:36.720
Now, think back to travel in the time before coronavirus.

01:36.720 --> 01:39.460
How full were the planes you were on?

01:39.460 --> 01:42.140
How often was that seat next to you free?

01:42.140 --> 01:46.580
The answer is almost certainly sometimes, but not that often.

01:46.580 --> 01:52.460
On average, 85% of airplane seats in the US were filled in 2019—slightly higher than

01:52.460 --> 01:54.820
the world average of 83%.

01:54.820 --> 02:02.180
Some airlines achieved even better than this—Ryanair, for example, filled 96% of its seats in 2019.

02:02.180 --> 02:08.160
Now, simultaneously, when was the last time that you've gone to buy a ticket for a flight,

02:08.160 --> 02:10.200
but there were none available?

02:10.200 --> 02:14.080
This too certainly happens, but it's quite rare.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.600
It might cost quite a lot, but if you want to buy a ticket to a flight, it'll almost

02:18.600 --> 02:23.180
always be available, no matter how close to departure it is.

02:23.180 --> 02:25.680
This is very, very intentional.

02:25.680 --> 02:31.000
Now, normally, the day-to-day job of adjusting the price of flights to extract every potential

02:31.000 --> 02:37.120
dollar out of them is handled by computers—specifically, the complex revenue management software on

02:37.120 --> 02:38.120
them.

02:38.120 --> 02:43.100
Around early March 2020, though, the computers started to go haywire.

02:43.100 --> 02:47.380
People weren't booking like they were supposed to, so the computers lowered the price.

02:47.380 --> 02:51.400
That should lead to bookings picking up, but they didn't, which confused the computers

02:51.400 --> 02:54.740
even more, which lowered the price further.

02:54.740 --> 02:59.420
This went on and on and on until the point where you could book flights from New York

02:59.420 --> 03:05.060
to London, for example, for just one or two hundred dollars round trip, hours before departure.

03:05.060 --> 03:11.420
It'd be easy to say prices were low because demand was, but that's not exactly the truth—it's

03:11.420 --> 03:13.880
just a byproduct of the truth.

03:13.880 --> 03:18.820
The computers and their revenue management software were tasked to extract the most revenue

03:18.820 --> 03:23.860
possible, regardless of demand, but in this case, they failed.

03:23.860 --> 03:30.520
Now, normally, businesses focus more on matching supply to demand, not demand to supply, because

03:30.520 --> 03:33.860
regulating demand is very, very difficult.

03:33.860 --> 03:38.100
Airlines, however, do both simultaneously.

03:38.100 --> 03:43.340
This is because they just can't regulate supply to match demand that well.

03:43.340 --> 03:48.880
Demand for travel fluctuates depending on which hour of which day of which year it is.

03:48.880 --> 03:52.400
Airlines just can't fluctuate their schedule to match that entirely.

03:52.400 --> 04:00.700
For example, airlines in the US making their 2020 schedules knew that last year, 2,487,398

04:00.700 --> 04:07.740
people traveled in the US on the second Thursday in April, while 2,616,158 people did on the

04:07.740 --> 04:09.280
third Thursday.

04:09.280 --> 04:14.460
For the most part, though, airlines will operate the same schedules on both of those Thursdays.

04:14.460 --> 04:20.120
That's because the complexity of adjusting the schedule to such small changes just isn't

04:20.120 --> 04:23.860
worth the money it would save by operating slightly fuller flights.

04:23.860 --> 04:29.940
Therefore, rather than rapidly adjusting supply to match demand, they rapidly adjust demand

04:29.940 --> 04:31.720
to fit supply.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.320
You can see this in action by looking at travel trends.

04:35.320 --> 04:40.820
In the US, the least busy quarter in 2019 for air travel was the first, January, February,

04:40.820 --> 04:43.820
and March, with 210 million passengers.

04:43.820 --> 04:49.400
The most busy quarter, meanwhile, was the third, July, August, and September, with 243

04:49.400 --> 04:50.400
million passengers.

04:50.400 --> 04:54.580
Now, that's not that much of a difference.

04:54.580 --> 05:00.040
The third quarter, including the height of the summer travel season, was only 16% busier

05:00.040 --> 05:03.840
than the first quarter, encompassing the depths of winter.

05:03.840 --> 05:09.380
But is it truly that demand is only 16% higher in the summer than winter, or is it that airlines

05:09.380 --> 05:14.240
are regulating demand to increase it in the winter and suppress it in the summer?

05:14.240 --> 05:16.720
All evidence points to the latter.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.440
So, airlines have this balancing act to perform.

05:20.440 --> 05:24.400
They want to be sure that they can capture as much of the high demand in the summer as

05:24.400 --> 05:28.360
possible, but they also don't want to have a bunch of planes and staff sitting around

05:28.360 --> 05:32.180
in the lower demand winter, as that costs quite a lot.

05:32.180 --> 05:36.220
Rather than flying a stable number of flights year-round or regulating demand to keep it

05:36.220 --> 05:40.820
stable year-round, they do a little of both and meet in the middle.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.580
The supply side is the easy bit.

05:43.580 --> 05:47.940
There is a certain predictable ebb and flow to the yearly cycle of travel for a given

05:47.940 --> 05:50.800
market for a given type of traveler.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.400
For example, take the American business traveler.

05:54.400 --> 05:58.260
Airlines know that the week with the lowest demand for travel from this demographic is

05:58.260 --> 06:02.820
the last of the year, after Christmas, followed by the first of the year, the second to last

06:02.820 --> 06:07.000
of the year, the week of the 4th of July, then the week of Thanksgiving.

06:07.000 --> 06:12.260
With this info, airlines can craft a schedule that, over those weeks, emphasizes leisure-focused

06:12.260 --> 06:14.500
destinations over business ones.

06:14.500 --> 06:18.780
They might decide that, in the last week of the year, they'll fly more flights to Florida

06:18.780 --> 06:20.420
and fewer to Chicago.

06:20.420 --> 06:25.660
Simultaneously, though, airlines know that September, October, and the week before Thanksgiving

06:25.660 --> 06:29.560
are the strongest period of the year for business travel, so they might increase the

06:29.560 --> 06:33.220
number of flights on common business routes over that time.

06:33.220 --> 06:38.520
So, airlines tweak their schedule mostly on a month-to-month or week-to-week basis, but

06:38.520 --> 06:45.260
for those day-to-day or hour-to-hour shifts in demand, they rely on regulating demand.

06:45.260 --> 06:50.820
The number one tool used to do this is pricing, and we can see this in action.

06:50.820 --> 06:55.160
Currently, if you want to book a ticket to fly United Airlines from Newark to Eagle County

06:55.160 --> 07:01.640
Airport in Colorado on January 1st, 2021, it would cost you $353.

07:01.640 --> 07:05.500
If you were to book United Airlines from Newark Airport to Denver International Airport on

07:05.500 --> 07:09.320
January 1st, though, it would cost you $134.

07:09.320 --> 07:15.440
So, flying to Eagle County is two and a half times more expensive than flying to Denver,

07:15.440 --> 07:19.280
even though it is only 120 miles further from New York.

07:19.280 --> 07:24.020
To United, the cost of operating these two flights are nearly identical—it's the

07:24.020 --> 07:27.720
same aircraft type and roughly the same flight length.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.980
There might be slight economies of scale by flying to Denver as it's a bigger airport,

07:31.980 --> 07:35.740
and there's a greater potential of a flight diversion at Eagle County Airport since it's

07:35.740 --> 07:40.360
in the mountains, but overall, the costs are very similar.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.940
What accounts for the difference in price is demand, not cost.

07:44.940 --> 07:49.340
United Airlines thinks it knows that four months prior to the flight, it can charge

07:49.340 --> 07:55.020
$353 for the flight to Eagle County and still end up with a full plane.

07:55.020 --> 08:01.340
Meanwhile, to end up with a full plane to Denver, it has to price it at $134.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.340
These prices will increase as it gets closer to departure, but just because of the way

08:05.340 --> 08:12.860
people book their travel to Eagle County Airport, $353 is the right price right now.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.940
So, how does United know this?

08:15.940 --> 08:19.820
Well, because it's what it did last year, and it worked.

08:19.820 --> 08:23.660
Airlines' greatest asset truly is their data.

08:23.660 --> 08:27.900
United Airlines knows exactly how much they need to price their flights at a certain level

08:27.900 --> 08:32.360
of fullness and a certain number of days before departure, and that means they can eke out

08:32.360 --> 08:36.300
every single bit of potential revenue from a given flight.

08:36.300 --> 08:40.940
If United priced the Eagle County flight too high, they might end up with empty seats,

08:40.940 --> 08:43.400
which is terrible for an airline.

08:43.400 --> 08:47.840
Every time a plane takes off with an empty seat, the airline is losing out on potential

08:47.840 --> 08:48.840
revenue.

08:48.840 --> 08:53.640
Aside from taxes, airport fees, and catering costs, there's essentially no extra cost

08:53.640 --> 08:59.280
to carrying an additional passenger, so selling a cheap ticket over no ticket is always worth

08:59.280 --> 09:00.280
it.

09:00.280 --> 09:04.460
Simultaneously, though, if an airline prices a flight too low, they might sell out of seats

09:04.460 --> 09:09.520
too early—losing out on the potential to sell high-priced tickets to last-minute travelers,

09:09.520 --> 09:12.960
who generally are those traveling for work who aren't paying for themselves.

09:13.520 --> 09:18.840
So, airlines rely on these price fluctuations to end up with a plane exactly full, exactly

09:18.840 --> 09:24.120
at departure, therefore, in theory, extracting the exact highest potential level of revenue

09:24.120 --> 09:26.060
from the flight.

09:26.060 --> 09:31.600
This makes the problem rather obvious—airlines simply don't know what their recovery will

09:31.600 --> 09:32.720
look like.

09:32.720 --> 09:37.600
Specifically, the computers don't know how people will respond to changes in pricing,

09:37.600 --> 09:42.160
so they don't know how to extract the most possible revenue from a flight by ending up

09:42.160 --> 09:45.740
with an exactly full flight, exactly at departure.

09:45.740 --> 09:50.840
The airline industry has had sharp drop-offs in demand before, but typically only in response

09:50.840 --> 09:53.880
to financial crises or terrorist attacks.

09:53.880 --> 10:00.720
In this case, in a pandemic, the closest equivalent happened 100 years ago, in 1918, when the

10:00.720 --> 10:04.120
commercial aviation industry was only in its infancy.

10:04.120 --> 10:09.480
Therefore, the aviation industry as a whole, and especially individual airlines, have no

10:09.480 --> 10:15.840
data and no idea what the demand patterns during and after a pandemic will be like.

10:15.840 --> 10:20.720
After the initial drop-off in travel and the plummet in pricing in response, airlines essentially

10:20.720 --> 10:24.600
turned off the computers—shut down the revenue management algorithms.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.120
They've gone back to relying on the humans, who traditionally are only there to tweak

10:29.120 --> 10:30.560
what the computer thinks.

10:30.560 --> 10:35.840
That's because the humans were able to realize something that the computers could not.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.400
Traditionally, airline demand is quite elastic.

10:39.400 --> 10:43.100
People will often decide whether or not to book based on the price.

10:43.100 --> 10:47.840
It is exactly this, in fact, that makes it possible for the airlines to regulate demand

10:47.840 --> 10:49.420
by changing prices.

10:49.420 --> 10:53.580
In the midst of the initial stay-at-home orders, though, the only type of person who would

10:53.580 --> 10:59.400
fly was someone who needed to fly—someone who would pay whatever it cost to get that

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
ticket.

11:00.400 --> 11:05.680
Therefore, there was no sense in lowering prices because that wouldn't stimulate demand—it

11:05.680 --> 11:07.600
would only reduce revenue.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.880
They also didn't jack them up tremendously, cautious not to get into the public relations

11:11.880 --> 11:16.600
nightmare of price gouging, but they more or less just kept them stable to what a normal

11:16.600 --> 11:18.120
April would look like.

11:18.120 --> 11:23.360
As May came about, and there was a small initial restart to discretionary travel, most every

11:23.360 --> 11:29.120
American airline lowered prices by about 10-20% to stimulate demand slightly.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.720
The problem, though, is that there are still way too many variables impacting travel to

11:33.720 --> 11:36.720
accurately predict and stimulate demand.

11:36.720 --> 11:41.160
American Airlines, for example, took a big gamble in May when they were crafting their

11:41.160 --> 11:43.080
revised summer schedule.

11:43.080 --> 11:47.880
They accurately surmised that people who were vacationing in summer 2020 would be particularly

11:47.880 --> 11:52.940
interested in destinations where the focus was the outdoors, such as at the beach.

11:52.940 --> 11:57.180
They also knew that many of the traditional beach destinations that Americans travel to

11:57.180 --> 12:02.400
in the Caribbean would be shut behind closed borders, so demand for this type of vacation

12:02.400 --> 12:05.640
would naturally shift domestically to Florida.

12:05.640 --> 12:09.720
This hypothesis was further supported by the fact that, in May, when they were working

12:09.720 --> 12:14.320
on this schedule, Florida had one of the lowest rates of infection in the US.

12:14.320 --> 12:18.600
Therefore, the airline decided to add loads of capacity into Florida to account for the

12:18.600 --> 12:21.200
relatively high demand it expected.

12:21.200 --> 12:26.720
Of course, starting in early June, there began a steep spike in the state's COVID cases,

12:26.720 --> 12:30.560
leading to increased weariness among consumers to travel to the state.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.600
Also, on a more general level, much of the summer travel season in the US did not live

12:35.600 --> 12:40.760
up to airlines' expectations due to a second spike in nationwide case numbers and increasing

12:40.760 --> 12:43.040
domestic travel restrictions.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.360
Passenger demand trends returned slightly closer to the April 2020 scenario, where it

12:47.360 --> 12:52.600
was less and less the cost of travel that stimulated demand, and rather external conditions.

12:52.600 --> 12:58.600
COVID has turned the job of those in revenue management at airlines closer to an art than

12:58.600 --> 12:59.920
a science.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.920
With decades upon decades of data, airlines got good at modeling the predictable patterns

13:04.920 --> 13:09.560
of travelers, but failed to consider the possibility for the unimaginable.

13:09.560 --> 13:14.840
Now, not only is overall demand lower, but airlines can't even extract the same level

13:14.840 --> 13:19.120
of revenue from the same number of travelers on a given flight.

13:19.120 --> 13:24.600
This unpredictability has a quite literal, monetary cost for airlines, so that means

13:24.600 --> 13:29.760
that, even when the travelers come back, even when the airports are full again, true recovery

13:29.760 --> 13:36.180
will not happen until passengers are predictable again.

13:36.180 --> 13:38.240
Uncertainty is not just a word.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.960
It's a force of nature that we can never get rid of, which is why mathematics has set

13:42.960 --> 13:45.340
up a system of tools to address it.

13:45.340 --> 13:49.960
The mathematics of uncertainty is fascinating and an incredibly powerful analytical tool,

13:49.960 --> 13:54.440
but it's an area of math that most people don't know a lot about.

13:54.440 --> 13:59.560
I certainly didn't until the new brilliant course on knowledge and uncertainty came around.

13:59.560 --> 14:04.540
This and all of Brilliant's courses are designed so they take these big, complex subjects

14:04.540 --> 14:06.920
and teach them in an intuitive way.

14:06.920 --> 14:11.360
With visuals, interactive elements, and clear explanations, all you need to do to learn

14:11.360 --> 14:16.000
about uncertainty or computer science or math or science is commit to working through the

14:16.000 --> 14:17.480
course regularly.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.720
After watching this video, taking the course on uncertainty will be even more interesting

14:21.720 --> 14:25.660
for you, as you'll be learning the exact sort of math that those working in revenue

14:25.660 --> 14:30.780
management at airlines are using to try to work their way through their massive uncertainty

14:30.780 --> 14:31.780
problem.
