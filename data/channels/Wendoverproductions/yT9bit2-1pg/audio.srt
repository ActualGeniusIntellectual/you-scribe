1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,760
Two weeks ago, Charlottesville erupted into chaos.

2
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,720
Violence met the streets as groups of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and far-right demonstrators

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,720
clashed with counter-protesters.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,960
Some have criticized and blamed the violence on the police response.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,000
The police had every opportunity.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,880
They're getting overtime pay, they're getting hazard pay.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,400
They've got tens of thousands of dollars of equipment per officer and they came out

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,480
here and they guarded empty space the entire day.

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,440
But to better understand why the demonstration ended up the way it did, you have to understand

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,940
how riot control works.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,520
The fundamental problem with riot control is that there are almost never more riot police

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,280
than rioters so the police need to artificially give themselves an advantage.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,800
Part of it is psychological.

14
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,080
They make it so rioters think that the police could defeat them.

15
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,660
The uniforms riot police wear are intentionally dehumanizing.

16
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,680
Clad in protective gear head to toe, you can hardly tell one person from the next.

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,000
This creates a psychological barrier between the police and the rioters.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,280
Studies have shown that these uniforms make both the protestors and the police themselves

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,320
feel like the police officers are more powerful than they are.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,880
It has also been proven that the way riot police act increases their perceived power.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,720
The officers almost always march and act in unison.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,440
When they act as a collective, just like the protestors, they personally feel as if they

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,400
have the power of the collective and the crowd does too.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,700
The most basic riot police formation looks like this.

25
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,600
With the goal of moving the crowd to another location, the front echelon slowly advances,

26
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,200
pushing rioters forward with their shields and batons.

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,040
They're followed by a team leader who organizes the whole group, most likely this officer

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,960
in the Charlottesville footage.

29
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,880
Right with the team leader are a few gas officers.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,200
You can see one here.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
They have tear gas or pepper spray to deploy over the front echelon towards any demonstrators

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,080
that put up a fight.

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,460
Following them is a group of arrest officers.

34
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,200
Should the front group encounter any particularly difficult rioters, they can open up, let the

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,040
demonstrator through, then the arresting officers can take the troublemaker into custody.

36
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Finishing is the rear echelon which protects the group and can sub out with the front echelon

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,740
when they tire.

38
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
This happens at rallies because of three facts.

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,420
Crowds are anonymous, anonymity breeds violence, and violence lowers consequences.

40
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,420
Crowds are de-individualizing.

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,660
When you're just one of a number, you don't think or act as much like an individual person.

42
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,140
A group of people, all with a common goal and a common way of thinking breeds a collective

43
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,140
conscience.

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,380
In a crowd, people don't think about consequences the same way they do when they're on their

45
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,380
own.

46
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,300
There's a sort of contagion of feeling.

47
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,880
Just like at a sports game or a nightclub, people act differently than they normally

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,180
might because other people do too.

49
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,000
There's a sort of wordless peer pressure.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,560
Individuals subconsciously escalate their violence to match that of the leaders.

51
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,840
People act almost by instinct in crowds and the individual breaks down and becomes a part

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,320
of the collective.

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,700
When there's widespread violence, individuals are punished less.

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,900
There's a lower sense of legal culpability since police often make far fewer arrests

55
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
than normal.

56
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,940
In a riot, authorities can't arrest everyone.

57
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,740
They target the leaders, the most violent protestors.

58
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,020
It's like running from a bear.

59
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:35,500
You don't have to be faster than the bear, you just have to be faster than the slowest

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,500
person.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,580
Dozens or perhaps hundreds of people committed violent acts in Charlottesville that normally

62
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,180
would have resulted in arrests, but out of them, only eight people were arrested.

63
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,920
Police have to be very careful with the directionality of the protest.

64
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,840
The police's goal is to stop or slow the riot while widespread arrests will often further

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,580
ignite the violence.

66
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,020
In Charlottesville, for example, if the police had intervened too strongly, the direction

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,060
could have turned and members of both groups could have directed their violence towards

68
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,320
the police.

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,060
Police never want to be perceived as unjust.

70
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,860
In a riot scenario that is dangerous, so they have to play a careful balancing act between

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,320
too little and too much response.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,760
So what went wrong in Charlottesville?

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,660
Why did it end up so violent and could the police have prevented it?

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,660
The Unite the Right rally was initially slated to begin at noon, but by 9am there were already

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,500
hundreds of demonstrators from both sides.

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,140
The police were not ready that early.

77
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,000
They weren't in their riot uniforms and they didn't have significant numbers.

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,300
The initial plan was to physically separate the two groups on separate sides of Emancipation

79
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,280
Park in downtown Charlottesville.

80
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,960
There were barriers set up, but nobody seemed to anticipate the number of people that showed

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
up.

82
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,160
The Unite the Right rally was in fact a permitted assembly.

83
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,720
The group's presence at Emancipation Park was fully legal, but the city did not want

84
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,280
them there specifically.

85
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,760
The city government tried to block the demonstration permit unless the group agreed to hold their

86
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,880
rally at nearby McIntire Park—a much larger and more open park nearby—but the rally's

87
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,400
managers successfully contested this move in court on First Amendment grounds and was

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,360
allowed to hold their rally right there in downtown Charlottesville.

89
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,960
There simply was not enough space for the number of people who showed up, but the fundamental

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,720
issue in Charlottesville was numbers.

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,600
Charlottesville is a small town—fewer than 50,000 people live there—and their police

92
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,760
force is correspondingly small.

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,160
While there were thousands of protestors, the police force had fewer than 130 officers.

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,760
At the same time, the officers working in Charlottesville were hardly experienced with

95
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
riots.

96
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,580
It's not a big city with frequent protests.

97
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,560
This might have been the first time many officers used their riot gear in the field.

98
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,880
They could not afford for the violence to turn towards them.

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,780
While the chief of police hasn't spoken much about his tactics, experts have said

100
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,920
that the lack of initial intervention was likely a conscious choice to assure that the

101
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:06,440
violence stayed between protestors and protestors, not between protestors and police.

102
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,600
Virginia is an open carry state and many demonstrators carried assault weapons so escalated

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,800
aggression could have turned the riot even deadlier.

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,000
At around 1140 AM, the Virginia State Police declared the protest an unlawful assembly

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,420
meaning it was then illegal to participate.

106
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,880
They subsequently began the process of breaking it up carefully.

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,080
Now how you break up a protest is very important.

108
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,720
Doing it wrong can turn deadly.

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,620
Their first priority was clearing Emancipation Park.

110
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,020
This was both a symbolic and physical center of the protest.

111
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:48,000
They made it known that the assembly was now unlawful, then began to slowly work their

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,580
way outwards in a uniform fashion pushing back anyone who put up a fight.

113
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:56,360
They strategically removed the violence leaders from the public area.

114
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,740
Here you can see the man in red pulled through the front echelon of officers.

115
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,900
He was likely brought into custody by the arrest officers behind the front echelon since

116
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,100
he was one of the main escalators.

117
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,900
There were other aggressors escalating the situation like this man with the flag, but

118
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,560
the police didn't risk breaking rank to take him into custody.

119
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,340
Doing so would expose officers to the violence of the main crowd.

120
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,980
Tear gas was used to get the final people out of the park.

121
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,280
Part of the reason tear gas is so effective is because the discomfort it brings makes

122
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,300
people stop their collective action to worry about themselves.

123
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,220
It takes them out of the mass and has them concentrate on the individual.

124
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,940
The park was eventually cleared, but the riot largely continued on the surrounding streets.

125
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,300
What was important was that the police did not try to contain the demonstrators.

126
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,620
They did try to contain the violence, but not the people.

127
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,580
Whenever riot police intervenes, they always want to leave an escape route for the demonstrators

128
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,300
who decide that they've had enough and want to leave.

129
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,820
A big reason why riot police look and act so intimidatingly is to get rioters to leave.

130
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,740
This is, in fact, exactly how you stop a riot—by getting people to leave.

131
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,640
In Charlottesville, after the clearing of Emancipation Park, many of the alt-right protesters

132
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,300
moved to a secondary location while the counter-protesters started marching in the surrounding streets.

133
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,940
After many hours of violence, the groups did, to an extent, naturally separate from each

134
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,080
other given the additional space and pressure of the illegality of the protest.

135
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,320
The police had set up a plan to physically separate the opposing groups from the start,

136
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,180
but that was an idealistic plan.

137
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,580
It was unrealistic to think that passionate, aggressive protesters would self-select into

138
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,740
their proper areas.

139
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,860
It's hard to know exactly if the police could have done a better job at preventing

140
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,900
violence.

141
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,980
From analysis, it's clear that they were overwhelmingly cautious in their techniques

142
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,700
which some may consider merited given their inexperience with riots and disadvantage in

143
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,700
numbers.

144
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,100
The techniques riot police use are designed to give them an advantage where they don't

145
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,100
have one.

146
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,940
They're tasked with preventing damage, injuries, and death but they do have to play a careful

147
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,880
game of balance to make sure that violence isn't immediately directed towards them.

148
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,020
If they're overwhelmed with directed violence, they can't effectively prevent damaging

149
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,020
violence.

150
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,300
They are in a position where they're criticized when they have too little response and criticized

151
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,660
when they have too much.

152
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,280
Everyone's opinion on the proper level of response differs so it's almost impossible

153
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,580
for an assembly to occur without criticism of the police.

154
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,420
Charlottesville was an unfortunate situation where thousands of people all came into a

155
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:36,340
tiny town to hold one of the most violent and passionate protests of this decade.

156
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,860
The best analysis of the police's response may be in the outcome.

157
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,620
There were no directly preventable deaths and damage to the city was minimal.

158
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,360
The United States and many other countries around the world are centered on the idea

159
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,820
of free speech so these police officers have the unenviable job of deciding where the demonstration

160
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,700
of this unalienable right stops and where dangerous, violent hooliganism begins.

161
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,700
On a lighter note, I'll be launching a brand new channel this Thursday, August 31st.

162
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,260
I don't want to reveal too much but it's essentially the continuation of the old TWL

163
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,260
series.
