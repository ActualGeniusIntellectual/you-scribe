0	10760	Two weeks ago, Charlottesville erupted into chaos.
10760	15720	Violence met the streets as groups of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and far-right demonstrators
15720	16720	clashed with counter-protesters.
16720	24960	Some have criticized and blamed the violence on the police response.
24960	27000	The police had every opportunity.
27000	29880	They're getting overtime pay, they're getting hazard pay.
29880	34400	They've got tens of thousands of dollars of equipment per officer and they came out
34400	37480	here and they guarded empty space the entire day.
37480	42440	But to better understand why the demonstration ended up the way it did, you have to understand
42440	46940	how riot control works.
46940	51520	The fundamental problem with riot control is that there are almost never more riot police
51520	56280	than rioters so the police need to artificially give themselves an advantage.
56280	57800	Part of it is psychological.
57800	61080	They make it so rioters think that the police could defeat them.
61080	64660	The uniforms riot police wear are intentionally dehumanizing.
64660	69680	Clad in protective gear head to toe, you can hardly tell one person from the next.
69680	74000	This creates a psychological barrier between the police and the rioters.
74000	78280	Studies have shown that these uniforms make both the protestors and the police themselves
78280	81320	feel like the police officers are more powerful than they are.
81320	86880	It has also been proven that the way riot police act increases their perceived power.
86880	90720	The officers almost always march and act in unison.
90720	95440	When they act as a collective, just like the protestors, they personally feel as if they
95440	99400	have the power of the collective and the crowd does too.
99400	102700	The most basic riot police formation looks like this.
102700	107600	With the goal of moving the crowd to another location, the front echelon slowly advances,
107600	110200	pushing rioters forward with their shields and batons.
110200	115040	They're followed by a team leader who organizes the whole group, most likely this officer
115040	116960	in the Charlottesville footage.
116960	119880	Right with the team leader are a few gas officers.
119880	121200	You can see one here.
121200	125520	They have tear gas or pepper spray to deploy over the front echelon towards any demonstrators
125520	127080	that put up a fight.
127080	129460	Following them is a group of arrest officers.
129460	134200	Should the front group encounter any particularly difficult rioters, they can open up, let the
134200	139040	demonstrator through, then the arresting officers can take the troublemaker into custody.
139040	143040	Finishing is the rear echelon which protects the group and can sub out with the front echelon
143040	144740	when they tire.
144740	147740	This happens at rallies because of three facts.
147740	153420	Crowds are anonymous, anonymity breeds violence, and violence lowers consequences.
153420	155420	Crowds are de-individualizing.
155420	160660	When you're just one of a number, you don't think or act as much like an individual person.
160660	166140	A group of people, all with a common goal and a common way of thinking breeds a collective
166140	167140	conscience.
167140	171380	In a crowd, people don't think about consequences the same way they do when they're on their
171380	172380	own.
172380	174300	There's a sort of contagion of feeling.
174300	177880	Just like at a sports game or a nightclub, people act differently than they normally
177880	180180	might because other people do too.
180180	183000	There's a sort of wordless peer pressure.
183000	187560	Individuals subconsciously escalate their violence to match that of the leaders.
187560	192840	People act almost by instinct in crowds and the individual breaks down and becomes a part
192840	194320	of the collective.
194320	197700	When there's widespread violence, individuals are punished less.
197700	202900	There's a lower sense of legal culpability since police often make far fewer arrests
202900	203900	than normal.
203900	206940	In a riot, authorities can't arrest everyone.
206940	209740	They target the leaders, the most violent protestors.
209740	211020	It's like running from a bear.
211020	215500	You don't have to be faster than the bear, you just have to be faster than the slowest
215500	216500	person.
216500	220580	Dozens or perhaps hundreds of people committed violent acts in Charlottesville that normally
220580	226180	would have resulted in arrests, but out of them, only eight people were arrested.
226180	229920	Police have to be very careful with the directionality of the protest.
229920	234840	The police's goal is to stop or slow the riot while widespread arrests will often further
234840	236580	ignite the violence.
236580	241020	In Charlottesville, for example, if the police had intervened too strongly, the direction
241020	245060	could have turned and members of both groups could have directed their violence towards
245060	246320	the police.
246320	249060	Police never want to be perceived as unjust.
249060	253860	In a riot scenario that is dangerous, so they have to play a careful balancing act between
253860	256320	too little and too much response.
256320	258760	So what went wrong in Charlottesville?
258760	262660	Why did it end up so violent and could the police have prevented it?
262660	267660	The Unite the Right rally was initially slated to begin at noon, but by 9am there were already
267660	270500	hundreds of demonstrators from both sides.
270500	273140	The police were not ready that early.
273140	277000	They weren't in their riot uniforms and they didn't have significant numbers.
277000	281300	The initial plan was to physically separate the two groups on separate sides of Emancipation
281300	283280	Park in downtown Charlottesville.
283280	287960	There were barriers set up, but nobody seemed to anticipate the number of people that showed
287960	288960	up.
288960	292160	The Unite the Right rally was in fact a permitted assembly.
292160	296720	The group's presence at Emancipation Park was fully legal, but the city did not want
296720	298280	them there specifically.
298280	302760	The city government tried to block the demonstration permit unless the group agreed to hold their
302760	308880	rally at nearby McIntire Park—a much larger and more open park nearby—but the rally's
308880	313400	managers successfully contested this move in court on First Amendment grounds and was
313400	317360	allowed to hold their rally right there in downtown Charlottesville.
317360	321960	There simply was not enough space for the number of people who showed up, but the fundamental
321960	324720	issue in Charlottesville was numbers.
324720	329600	Charlottesville is a small town—fewer than 50,000 people live there—and their police
329600	331760	force is correspondingly small.
331760	338160	While there were thousands of protestors, the police force had fewer than 130 officers.
338160	342760	At the same time, the officers working in Charlottesville were hardly experienced with
342760	343760	riots.
343760	345580	It's not a big city with frequent protests.
345580	349560	This might have been the first time many officers used their riot gear in the field.
349560	352880	They could not afford for the violence to turn towards them.
352880	356780	While the chief of police hasn't spoken much about his tactics, experts have said
356780	360920	that the lack of initial intervention was likely a conscious choice to assure that the
360920	366440	violence stayed between protestors and protestors, not between protestors and police.
366440	371600	Virginia is an open carry state and many demonstrators carried assault weapons so escalated
371600	374800	aggression could have turned the riot even deadlier.
374800	380000	At around 1140 AM, the Virginia State Police declared the protest an unlawful assembly
380000	382420	meaning it was then illegal to participate.
382420	385880	They subsequently began the process of breaking it up carefully.
385880	389080	Now how you break up a protest is very important.
389080	390720	Doing it wrong can turn deadly.
390720	393620	Their first priority was clearing Emancipation Park.
393620	397020	This was both a symbolic and physical center of the protest.
397020	408000	They made it known that the assembly was now unlawful, then began to slowly work their
408000	412580	way outwards in a uniform fashion pushing back anyone who put up a fight.
412580	416360	They strategically removed the violence leaders from the public area.
416360	419740	Here you can see the man in red pulled through the front echelon of officers.
419740	423900	He was likely brought into custody by the arrest officers behind the front echelon since
423900	426100	he was one of the main escalators.
426100	429900	There were other aggressors escalating the situation like this man with the flag, but
429900	433560	the police didn't risk breaking rank to take him into custody.
433560	437340	Doing so would expose officers to the violence of the main crowd.
437340	439980	Tear gas was used to get the final people out of the park.
439980	444280	Part of the reason tear gas is so effective is because the discomfort it brings makes
444280	448300	people stop their collective action to worry about themselves.
448300	452220	It takes them out of the mass and has them concentrate on the individual.
452220	456940	The park was eventually cleared, but the riot largely continued on the surrounding streets.
456940	461300	What was important was that the police did not try to contain the demonstrators.
461300	464620	They did try to contain the violence, but not the people.
464620	469580	Whenever riot police intervenes, they always want to leave an escape route for the demonstrators
469580	472300	who decide that they've had enough and want to leave.
472300	478820	A big reason why riot police look and act so intimidatingly is to get rioters to leave.
478820	483740	This is, in fact, exactly how you stop a riot—by getting people to leave.
483740	488640	In Charlottesville, after the clearing of Emancipation Park, many of the alt-right protesters
488640	494300	moved to a secondary location while the counter-protesters started marching in the surrounding streets.
494300	498940	After many hours of violence, the groups did, to an extent, naturally separate from each
498940	504080	other given the additional space and pressure of the illegality of the protest.
504080	508320	The police had set up a plan to physically separate the opposing groups from the start,
508320	510180	but that was an idealistic plan.
510180	515580	It was unrealistic to think that passionate, aggressive protesters would self-select into
515580	516740	their proper areas.
516740	520860	It's hard to know exactly if the police could have done a better job at preventing
520860	521900	violence.
521900	525980	From analysis, it's clear that they were overwhelmingly cautious in their techniques
525980	530700	which some may consider merited given their inexperience with riots and disadvantage in
530700	531700	numbers.
531700	536100	The techniques riot police use are designed to give them an advantage where they don't
536100	537100	have one.
537100	541940	They're tasked with preventing damage, injuries, and death but they do have to play a careful
541940	546880	game of balance to make sure that violence isn't immediately directed towards them.
546880	552020	If they're overwhelmed with directed violence, they can't effectively prevent damaging
552020	553020	violence.
553060	557300	They are in a position where they're criticized when they have too little response and criticized
557300	558660	when they have too much.
558660	563280	Everyone's opinion on the proper level of response differs so it's almost impossible
563280	566580	for an assembly to occur without criticism of the police.
566580	571420	Charlottesville was an unfortunate situation where thousands of people all came into a
571420	576340	tiny town to hold one of the most violent and passionate protests of this decade.
576340	579860	The best analysis of the police's response may be in the outcome.
580220	584620	There were no directly preventable deaths and damage to the city was minimal.
584620	588360	The United States and many other countries around the world are centered on the idea
588360	593820	of free speech so these police officers have the unenviable job of deciding where the demonstration
593820	600700	of this unalienable right stops and where dangerous, violent hooliganism begins.
600700	605700	On a lighter note, I'll be launching a brand new channel this Thursday, August 31st.
606220	611260	I don't want to reveal too much but it's essentially the continuation of the old TWL
611260	612260	series.
