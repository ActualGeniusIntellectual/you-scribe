00:00.000 --> 00:10.760
Two weeks ago, Charlottesville erupted into chaos.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.720
Violence met the streets as groups of white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and far-right demonstrators

00:15.720 --> 00:16.720
clashed with counter-protesters.

00:16.720 --> 00:24.960
Some have criticized and blamed the violence on the police response.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.000
The police had every opportunity.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.880
They're getting overtime pay, they're getting hazard pay.

00:29.880 --> 00:34.400
They've got tens of thousands of dollars of equipment per officer and they came out

00:34.400 --> 00:37.480
here and they guarded empty space the entire day.

00:37.480 --> 00:42.440
But to better understand why the demonstration ended up the way it did, you have to understand

00:42.440 --> 00:46.940
how riot control works.

00:46.940 --> 00:51.520
The fundamental problem with riot control is that there are almost never more riot police

00:51.520 --> 00:56.280
than rioters so the police need to artificially give themselves an advantage.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.800
Part of it is psychological.

00:57.800 --> 01:01.080
They make it so rioters think that the police could defeat them.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.660
The uniforms riot police wear are intentionally dehumanizing.

01:04.660 --> 01:09.680
Clad in protective gear head to toe, you can hardly tell one person from the next.

01:09.680 --> 01:14.000
This creates a psychological barrier between the police and the rioters.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.280
Studies have shown that these uniforms make both the protestors and the police themselves

01:18.280 --> 01:21.320
feel like the police officers are more powerful than they are.

01:21.320 --> 01:26.880
It has also been proven that the way riot police act increases their perceived power.

01:26.880 --> 01:30.720
The officers almost always march and act in unison.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.440
When they act as a collective, just like the protestors, they personally feel as if they

01:35.440 --> 01:39.400
have the power of the collective and the crowd does too.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.700
The most basic riot police formation looks like this.

01:42.700 --> 01:47.600
With the goal of moving the crowd to another location, the front echelon slowly advances,

01:47.600 --> 01:50.200
pushing rioters forward with their shields and batons.

01:50.200 --> 01:55.040
They're followed by a team leader who organizes the whole group, most likely this officer

01:55.040 --> 01:56.960
in the Charlottesville footage.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.880
Right with the team leader are a few gas officers.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.200
You can see one here.

02:01.200 --> 02:05.520
They have tear gas or pepper spray to deploy over the front echelon towards any demonstrators

02:05.520 --> 02:07.080
that put up a fight.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.460
Following them is a group of arrest officers.

02:09.460 --> 02:14.200
Should the front group encounter any particularly difficult rioters, they can open up, let the

02:14.200 --> 02:19.040
demonstrator through, then the arresting officers can take the troublemaker into custody.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.040
Finishing is the rear echelon which protects the group and can sub out with the front echelon

02:23.040 --> 02:24.740
when they tire.

02:24.740 --> 02:27.740
This happens at rallies because of three facts.

02:27.740 --> 02:33.420
Crowds are anonymous, anonymity breeds violence, and violence lowers consequences.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.420
Crowds are de-individualizing.

02:35.420 --> 02:40.660
When you're just one of a number, you don't think or act as much like an individual person.

02:40.660 --> 02:46.140
A group of people, all with a common goal and a common way of thinking breeds a collective

02:46.140 --> 02:47.140
conscience.

02:47.140 --> 02:51.380
In a crowd, people don't think about consequences the same way they do when they're on their

02:51.380 --> 02:52.380
own.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.300
There's a sort of contagion of feeling.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.880
Just like at a sports game or a nightclub, people act differently than they normally

02:57.880 --> 03:00.180
might because other people do too.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.000
There's a sort of wordless peer pressure.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.560
Individuals subconsciously escalate their violence to match that of the leaders.

03:07.560 --> 03:12.840
People act almost by instinct in crowds and the individual breaks down and becomes a part

03:12.840 --> 03:14.320
of the collective.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.700
When there's widespread violence, individuals are punished less.

03:17.700 --> 03:22.900
There's a lower sense of legal culpability since police often make far fewer arrests

03:22.900 --> 03:23.900
than normal.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.940
In a riot, authorities can't arrest everyone.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.740
They target the leaders, the most violent protestors.

03:29.740 --> 03:31.020
It's like running from a bear.

03:31.020 --> 03:35.500
You don't have to be faster than the bear, you just have to be faster than the slowest

03:35.500 --> 03:36.500
person.

03:36.500 --> 03:40.580
Dozens or perhaps hundreds of people committed violent acts in Charlottesville that normally

03:40.580 --> 03:46.180
would have resulted in arrests, but out of them, only eight people were arrested.

03:46.180 --> 03:49.920
Police have to be very careful with the directionality of the protest.

03:49.920 --> 03:54.840
The police's goal is to stop or slow the riot while widespread arrests will often further

03:54.840 --> 03:56.580
ignite the violence.

03:56.580 --> 04:01.020
In Charlottesville, for example, if the police had intervened too strongly, the direction

04:01.020 --> 04:05.060
could have turned and members of both groups could have directed their violence towards

04:05.060 --> 04:06.320
the police.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.060
Police never want to be perceived as unjust.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.860
In a riot scenario that is dangerous, so they have to play a careful balancing act between

04:13.860 --> 04:16.320
too little and too much response.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.760
So what went wrong in Charlottesville?

04:18.760 --> 04:22.660
Why did it end up so violent and could the police have prevented it?

04:22.660 --> 04:27.660
The Unite the Right rally was initially slated to begin at noon, but by 9am there were already

04:27.660 --> 04:30.500
hundreds of demonstrators from both sides.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.140
The police were not ready that early.

04:33.140 --> 04:37.000
They weren't in their riot uniforms and they didn't have significant numbers.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.300
The initial plan was to physically separate the two groups on separate sides of Emancipation

04:41.300 --> 04:43.280
Park in downtown Charlottesville.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.960
There were barriers set up, but nobody seemed to anticipate the number of people that showed

04:47.960 --> 04:48.960
up.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.160
The Unite the Right rally was in fact a permitted assembly.

04:52.160 --> 04:56.720
The group's presence at Emancipation Park was fully legal, but the city did not want

04:56.720 --> 04:58.280
them there specifically.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.760
The city government tried to block the demonstration permit unless the group agreed to hold their

05:02.760 --> 05:08.880
rally at nearby McIntire Park—a much larger and more open park nearby—but the rally's

05:08.880 --> 05:13.400
managers successfully contested this move in court on First Amendment grounds and was

05:13.400 --> 05:17.360
allowed to hold their rally right there in downtown Charlottesville.

05:17.360 --> 05:21.960
There simply was not enough space for the number of people who showed up, but the fundamental

05:21.960 --> 05:24.720
issue in Charlottesville was numbers.

05:24.720 --> 05:29.600
Charlottesville is a small town—fewer than 50,000 people live there—and their police

05:29.600 --> 05:31.760
force is correspondingly small.

05:31.760 --> 05:38.160
While there were thousands of protestors, the police force had fewer than 130 officers.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.760
At the same time, the officers working in Charlottesville were hardly experienced with

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
riots.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.580
It's not a big city with frequent protests.

05:45.580 --> 05:49.560
This might have been the first time many officers used their riot gear in the field.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.880
They could not afford for the violence to turn towards them.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.780
While the chief of police hasn't spoken much about his tactics, experts have said

05:56.780 --> 06:00.920
that the lack of initial intervention was likely a conscious choice to assure that the

06:00.920 --> 06:06.440
violence stayed between protestors and protestors, not between protestors and police.

06:06.440 --> 06:11.600
Virginia is an open carry state and many demonstrators carried assault weapons so escalated

06:11.600 --> 06:14.800
aggression could have turned the riot even deadlier.

06:14.800 --> 06:20.000
At around 1140 AM, the Virginia State Police declared the protest an unlawful assembly

06:20.000 --> 06:22.420
meaning it was then illegal to participate.

06:22.420 --> 06:25.880
They subsequently began the process of breaking it up carefully.

06:25.880 --> 06:29.080
Now how you break up a protest is very important.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.720
Doing it wrong can turn deadly.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.620
Their first priority was clearing Emancipation Park.

06:33.620 --> 06:37.020
This was both a symbolic and physical center of the protest.

06:37.020 --> 06:48.000
They made it known that the assembly was now unlawful, then began to slowly work their

06:48.000 --> 06:52.580
way outwards in a uniform fashion pushing back anyone who put up a fight.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.360
They strategically removed the violence leaders from the public area.

06:56.360 --> 06:59.740
Here you can see the man in red pulled through the front echelon of officers.

06:59.740 --> 07:03.900
He was likely brought into custody by the arrest officers behind the front echelon since

07:03.900 --> 07:06.100
he was one of the main escalators.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.900
There were other aggressors escalating the situation like this man with the flag, but

07:09.900 --> 07:13.560
the police didn't risk breaking rank to take him into custody.

07:13.560 --> 07:17.340
Doing so would expose officers to the violence of the main crowd.

07:17.340 --> 07:19.980
Tear gas was used to get the final people out of the park.

07:19.980 --> 07:24.280
Part of the reason tear gas is so effective is because the discomfort it brings makes

07:24.280 --> 07:28.300
people stop their collective action to worry about themselves.

07:28.300 --> 07:32.220
It takes them out of the mass and has them concentrate on the individual.

07:32.220 --> 07:36.940
The park was eventually cleared, but the riot largely continued on the surrounding streets.

07:36.940 --> 07:41.300
What was important was that the police did not try to contain the demonstrators.

07:41.300 --> 07:44.620
They did try to contain the violence, but not the people.

07:44.620 --> 07:49.580
Whenever riot police intervenes, they always want to leave an escape route for the demonstrators

07:49.580 --> 07:52.300
who decide that they've had enough and want to leave.

07:52.300 --> 07:58.820
A big reason why riot police look and act so intimidatingly is to get rioters to leave.

07:58.820 --> 08:03.740
This is, in fact, exactly how you stop a riot—by getting people to leave.

08:03.740 --> 08:08.640
In Charlottesville, after the clearing of Emancipation Park, many of the alt-right protesters

08:08.640 --> 08:14.300
moved to a secondary location while the counter-protesters started marching in the surrounding streets.

08:14.300 --> 08:18.940
After many hours of violence, the groups did, to an extent, naturally separate from each

08:18.940 --> 08:24.080
other given the additional space and pressure of the illegality of the protest.

08:24.080 --> 08:28.320
The police had set up a plan to physically separate the opposing groups from the start,

08:28.320 --> 08:30.180
but that was an idealistic plan.

08:30.180 --> 08:35.580
It was unrealistic to think that passionate, aggressive protesters would self-select into

08:35.580 --> 08:36.740
their proper areas.

08:36.740 --> 08:40.860
It's hard to know exactly if the police could have done a better job at preventing

08:40.860 --> 08:41.900
violence.

08:41.900 --> 08:45.980
From analysis, it's clear that they were overwhelmingly cautious in their techniques

08:45.980 --> 08:50.700
which some may consider merited given their inexperience with riots and disadvantage in

08:50.700 --> 08:51.700
numbers.

08:51.700 --> 08:56.100
The techniques riot police use are designed to give them an advantage where they don't

08:56.100 --> 08:57.100
have one.

08:57.100 --> 09:01.940
They're tasked with preventing damage, injuries, and death but they do have to play a careful

09:01.940 --> 09:06.880
game of balance to make sure that violence isn't immediately directed towards them.

09:06.880 --> 09:12.020
If they're overwhelmed with directed violence, they can't effectively prevent damaging

09:12.020 --> 09:13.020
violence.

09:13.060 --> 09:17.300
They are in a position where they're criticized when they have too little response and criticized

09:17.300 --> 09:18.660
when they have too much.

09:18.660 --> 09:23.280
Everyone's opinion on the proper level of response differs so it's almost impossible

09:23.280 --> 09:26.580
for an assembly to occur without criticism of the police.

09:26.580 --> 09:31.420
Charlottesville was an unfortunate situation where thousands of people all came into a

09:31.420 --> 09:36.340
tiny town to hold one of the most violent and passionate protests of this decade.

09:36.340 --> 09:39.860
The best analysis of the police's response may be in the outcome.

09:40.220 --> 09:44.620
There were no directly preventable deaths and damage to the city was minimal.

09:44.620 --> 09:48.360
The United States and many other countries around the world are centered on the idea

09:48.360 --> 09:53.820
of free speech so these police officers have the unenviable job of deciding where the demonstration

09:53.820 --> 10:00.700
of this unalienable right stops and where dangerous, violent hooliganism begins.

10:00.700 --> 10:05.700
On a lighter note, I'll be launching a brand new channel this Thursday, August 31st.

10:06.220 --> 10:11.260
I don't want to reveal too much but it's essentially the continuation of the old TWL

10:11.260 --> 10:12.260
series.
