4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,920
Normal times in business are like a road.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,600
For the most part, competitors are all heading in the same direction and, while some might

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,840
turn away and try a different path, for the most part, the only way to get ahead is through

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,400
brute force—to slowly catch up and take the lead.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
That is difficult.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,640
Abnormal times in business, though, when an industry is in crisis, are like a fork in

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,640
the road.

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,220
The competitors all reach it together and are forced to pick a path.

12
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,720
This levels the playing field.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,060
While the big players have the resources to evaluate the different paths, and might have

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,080
experience from times when this has happened before, all companies, big and small, must

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,200
pick a path, and at the end of the day, only one is going to work best.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,380
This can be an equalizer.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:05,380
It stress tests the big incumbent firms to see if they're still the strongest, or riding

18
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:09,960
on inertia, and gives smaller players the opportunity to make bold choices that could

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,040
put them ahead.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,360
This is what's happening in the airline industry right now.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,400
It's one of the clusters of companies that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, had

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,900
to almost entirely shut down, and is now in the process of turning back on and reinventing

23
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,340
itself to capture a new set of consumers with new needs and wants.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,820
Industry turmoil is happening, and that means that there's a case to be made that we're

25
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,080
at that fork in the road, that all airlines are having to pick a path, and that this could

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,380
lead to a shuffling of the rank and order of the industry.

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,780
There's a case to be made that right now, for the first time in a long time, there's

28
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,180
real opportunity for something new.

29
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,860
There's opportunity for airline entrepreneurship.

30
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,500
If you were tasked with starting an accounting business, or a coffee shop, or a landscaping

31
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,860
business, you'd probably know roughly what you needed to do to start—you'd need to

32
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:11,340
get a license, or a retail space, or some lawnmowers—and, with enough initiative

33
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,940
and a little bit of luck, you'd probably even have a real shot at successfully starting

34
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,460
any one of these.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,640
Meanwhile, if you were tasked with starting an airline, you and I both know that, no matter

36
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,420
your luck or initiative, you'd have almost no shot of ever taking off.

37
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,540
Due to its complexity and capital intensity, successful airline entrepreneurship is one

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,320
of the most difficult endeavors in business, but it is something that, occasionally, real

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,240
people actually do.

40
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,640
So what does it take?

41
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,760
What is step one of forming a new airline?

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Well, first an airline needs a business model.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
Now, everything for startup airlines nowadays builds off of what makes them unique, and

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,200
new airlines have to be unique.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,900
You see, fundamentally, for a new company to succeed, they need to do something better

46
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,140
than their competitors—they need to be cheaper, faster, more convenient, or just do something

47
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,700
that others do not.

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,460
If they don't, then why would customers choose to switch to them?

49
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,840
The competitive advantage of major airlines is that they are major—is that you can get

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,720
on one of their planes on one side of the world and, after a few connections, get off

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,900
on the other.

52
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,520
The problem is that almost all of the major full-service network carriers, as those in

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,500
the industry will call them, were formed in the early days of commercial aviation and

54
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,320
grew as the industry did.

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,140
Today, it would just be effectively impossible for an airline to launch with enough scale

56
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,400
to compete directly with United, British Airways, or Singapore Airlines, and if they didn't,

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,500
the legacy airlines would crush them faster than they could get to the necessary scale

58
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,900
for their competitive advantage to be considered their size.

59
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,960
Of the ten largest airlines in the US, none were founded in the current century, and in

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,260
Europe, only one was—Wizz Air, which nobody would consider a full-service network carrier.

61
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,460
In fact, globally, one of the only examples of a full-service network carrier established

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,960
within the past few decades without government support is Virgin Australia, and in their

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,920
case, it was almost by accident.

64
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,520
The collapse of Ansett Australia, which was the country's only major full-service network

65
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,260
carrier at the time, left a massive void in Australia's aviation market only a year

66
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,860
into Virgin Australia's operations, which gave the company the opportunity to grow quite

67
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,820
quickly and effectively.

68
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,280
However, even this example gives further credence to the theory that it's nearly impossible

69
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,780
for a new major full-service network carrier to emerge in the 21st century, as Virgin Australia

70
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,920
entered administration in 2020, and is now exiting as a smaller, primarily domestic airline—seeding

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,300
the international market to its legacy competitor, Qantas.

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,540
So, once again, new airlines need a strong, defined, and unique business model to succeed.

73
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:05,860
Looking at three of the most promising startup airlines planned to launch in 2021, a strong,

74
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,500
defined, and unique business model is exactly what each of them has.

75
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,340
Flypop, for example, is planning to launch long-haul low-cost flights from the UK to

76
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,540
secondary cities in India without existing non-stop service, such as Amritsar and Ahmedabad,

77
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,940
in order to cater to the Indian diaspora living in the UK.

78
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,900
Meanwhile, Play Airlines is looking to reprise the business model of now-defunct Wow Air,

79
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,700
and was even founded by former Wow executives by focusing on facilitating low-cost transatlantic

80
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,420
travel with connecting itineraries through Iceland.

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,140
Then, in what is likely the most promising airline startup of 2021, as its founder previously

82
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,740
launched WestJet, Azul Airways, and JetBlue, Breeze Airways is looking to launch what they

83
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,280
refer to as hub-busting flights on underserved routes in the US, meaning they're identifying

84
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,600
routes without existing non-stop service such as Tulsa to New York or Louisville to Los

85
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,780
Angeles, and capturing demand by setting up non-stop service.

86
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,220
Crucially, each of these three business models do not involve directly competing with full-service

87
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,980
network carriers.

88
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,580
Budget airlines like Play Airlines and Fly Pop tend to expand the pie by offering prices

89
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,940
that stimulate demand from a lower market segment that likely would not regularly fly

90
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,380
on a full-service network carrier, while Breeze Airways will likely most directly compete

91
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,460
with Southwest, as it's the primary incumbent airline that might offer non-stop hub-busting

92
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,600
flights.

93
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,540
In the selection of a business model, not competing against the world's largest airlines

94
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:36,500
is a good choice, because full-service network carriers have the time and money to start

95
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,780
and win a price war, while startup airlines do not.

96
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:46,080
That's because it's very difficult for startup airlines to get funding.

97
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,540
There just isn't the appetite for it, because the airline industry has very little upside

98
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,540
for investors.

99
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,860
It goes through massive, dramatic cycles of profit and loss depending on oil prices and

100
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,320
external economic conditions, but even in the best of times, it makes a very thin profit.

101
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,740
Over the past 25 years, even before the Coronavirus pandemic, the industry has hovered around

102
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,740
a 4-5% operating margin.

103
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,660
Investors could just as easily put their money into something more secure, like the railroad

104
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,060
industry, which hovers between a 25 and 30% operating margin.

105
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,740
In fact, that's exactly what investor Warren Buffett has done—he's famously shirked

106
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,460
significant investments in airlines, while taking massive, successful bets on the American

107
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,860
railroad industry.

108
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,300
For this reason, many startup airlines fail before launch simply because they cannot secure

109
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,780
funding, or after launch because they didn't secure enough funding to reach critical mass.

110
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,260
For those three most promising startup airlines of 2021, though, they each have seemingly

111
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,700
found enough money to launch.

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,060
Play Airlines secured a $42 million investment from Avianta Capital, which is an Irish investment

113
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,680
fund run by Aslan Whitley-Ryan—a member of an influential aviation family which includes

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,420
the founders of Ryanair.

115
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:06,660
Meanwhile, Flypop's exact investor makeup is less clear, but their largest source of

116
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,100
funding is coming from a UK government fund intended to kickstart innovative businesses

117
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,300
whose launch was affected by COVID.

118
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,500
Finally, Breeze took the most traditional funding path, having raised $83.3 million

119
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,020
through the venture capital industry, but that was likely only possible due to its founders'

120
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,200
remarkably consistent track record of successful airline startups.

121
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,860
The only consistency with startup airline funding is inconsistency.

122
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,660
Unlike other industries, where there is often a defined ecosystem of investors willing and

123
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,360
sometimes competing to fund startups with a strong business model, plan, executive team,

124
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,460
and proof of concept, you just don't have that with airlines.

125
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,220
The tiny number of new entrants, plus the general lack of appetite from investors, means

126
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,340
that finding funding to complete the extraordinarily expensive tasks required to set up an airline

127
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,360
is itself the task that prevents most from reaching takeoff.

128
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,340
One of those extraordinarily expensive tasks involves quite simply gaining the legal right

129
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,300
to operate an airline.

130
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,180
Every national aviation authority issues what are typically called air operator certificates,

131
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,940
which allows a company to use their aircraft for commercial purposes.

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,020
In the US, there are essentially two choices of certificate type for scheduled airlines.

133
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,380
The first, and simpler one, is a Part 135 certificate—referring to the section of

134
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,980
the US's federal aviation regulations that outline this certificate's operating requirements.

135
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,220
Now, a Part 135 certificate is primarily used for cargo and passenger charter operations,

136
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,380
which often includes private jet operations, but it can also be used for certain scheduled

137
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,380
operations.

138
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,780
This certificate only allows the use of aircraft with nine passenger seats or fewer on scheduled

139
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,340
operations, with a few exceptions.

140
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,580
One of the largest Part 135 scheduled airlines in the US, for example, is Cape Air, which

141
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,700
operates a fleet of 94 nine-seat aircraft to primarily small, government-subsidized

142
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,840
destinations around the US and Caribbean.

143
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,140
Because they are on a Part 135 certificate, they can do things like operate flights with

144
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,860
a single pilot, even though in practice most of their flights operate with two pilots,

145
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,500
whereas a Part 121 certificate holder, like United Airlines, for example, would need two

146
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,740
pilots even to operate the exact same aircraft on the exact same route.

147
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:29,220
In general, the regulations for Part 135 operations are slightly less stringent, and that also

148
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,020
means that attaining this license is a lot easier.

149
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,300
Airlines apparently average between $35,000 and $95,000 in legal fees, plus an additional

150
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,780
$50,000 in expenses to attain a Part 135 certificate.

151
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:49,760
Meanwhile, getting a Part 121 air operator certificate is much, much more difficult.

152
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,520
These are the certificates held by United, American Airlines, Delta, and any other large

153
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,300
commercial airline in the US, and the process to attain one is so complicated that it's

154
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,540
essentially impossible without hiring a third-party consultancy to assist.

155
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,540
This in and of itself is such a niche process that there are only six FAA-endorsed Part

156
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:14,260
121 certification consultancies in existence.

157
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:20,620
After all, there are only 104 active Part 121 airlines in the US, so a new certification

158
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,100
is a fairly rare occurrence.

159
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,300
While none of the FAA-endorsed certification consultancies publicize prices, a non-endorsed

160
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,540
competitor lists their consulting fee as $1.2 million, which includes things like creating

161
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,580
an operations manual, trading management, setting up electronic flight bags, establishing

162
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,920
a drug and alcohol testing program, and almost everything else needed prior to application,

163
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,340
plus the management of the process of actually applying itself.

164
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,640
In general, the reason this application process is so strenuous is because a startup airline

165
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,920
must set up the internal infrastructure for all the extensive safety programs needed to

166
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,300
pass the FAA's review, and then it must present a massive packet of documents proving

167
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,280
that it has done all these things.

168
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,520
Given the complexity of this process, some airlines decide to purchase, rather than apply

169
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,240
for, an air operator certificate.

170
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,420
This is what Breeze Airways initially planned to do.

171
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,600
In July, they applied for the US Department of Transportation to transfer the certificate

172
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,420
of now-defunct Compass Airlines to them, but they eventually dropped this plan due to pushback

173
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,620
from other airlines and Compass' pilot's union.

174
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,340
Now Breeze is going through the process of applying for its own air operator certificate,

175
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,660
but it goes to show that buying an existing one is a very real possibility, and it's

176
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,420
something that happens fairly frequently with Part 135 certificates.

177
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:45,340
In fact, there are even websites listing small Part 135 airlines for sale, which can be bought

178
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,140
specifically for their certificates.

179
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,620
Around the world, while each country's exact process is different, certification is quite

180
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,860
often a major hurdle for a new airline, as each country's air regulator needs to see

181
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,720
that the startup is fit to fly before giving them their stamp of approval.

182
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,460
Of course, these previous steps—of deciding on a business model, finding funding, and

183
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,140
attaining an air operator certificate—have nothing to do with the most fundamental thing

184
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,140
an airline needs to operate—airplanes.

185
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:21,700
Now, somewhat counterintuitively, acquiring airplanes is actually one of the simpler phases

186
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,100
of the airline startup process.

187
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,980
The reason why this is is because, quite often, airlines don't actually own aircraft themselves.

188
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:36,020
This is part of the reason why Breeze, for example, can launch with only about $90 million

189
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,660
in funding, despite the fact that a single one of their planned flagship aircraft, the

190
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,820
A220-300, has a list price of about $90 million.

191
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,540
Rather, a startup airline like Breeze tends to use one of two techniques.

192
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,060
The first option is to lease.

193
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,660
This works essentially like a car lease, just on a much larger scale.

194
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,380
Some 50% of commercial aircraft globally are under-lease, and this option is often more

195
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,740
popular with smaller airlines.

196
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,780
The advantages of leasing aircraft are straightforward—it spreads out the cost, without the need to take

197
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,420
on debt, and it reduces risk, as lease terms can be shorter than the useful life of an

198
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:18,180
aircraft, and there can be some options to return aircraft before the end of their lease

199
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,140
if there's no longer the need.

200
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,620
In addition, leasing aircraft allows airlines to get aircraft faster.

201
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,580
Aircraft manufacturers often have a multi-year backlog.

202
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,820
Airbus, for example, as of December 2020, has a 7,000 aircraft order backlog, meaning

203
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,740
an airline ordering an aircraft today wouldn't receive it for many years.

204
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,540
Lessors often have aircraft available within months or even weeks, making this the attractive

205
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,300
option for startups.

206
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:53,500
Also, particularly nowadays, COVID has made getting an airplane on lease easier.

207
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,700
Existing airlines have been downsizing their fleets and getting rid of older, less fuel-efficient

208
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,920
aircraft.

209
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,180
In the case of American Airlines and Air Canada, that meant retiring 20 and 14, respectively,

210
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,120
of their E190 aircraft.

211
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,500
It so happens that Breeze is launching with E190 aircraft and, even though they aren't

212
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,420
directly leasing the retired aircraft of American and Air Canada, more aircraft of a type in

213
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,700
the marketplace pushes prices down.

214
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,300
There is, however, another mechanism increasingly used by airlines, especially when they need

215
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,620
to get newer aircraft for which there isn't a large second-hand market.

216
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,220
Breeze, for example, has an order with Airbus for 60 A220-300 aircraft.

217
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,280
Now, this order is directly from Breeze to Airbus, but Breeze themselves could never

218
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,820
pay for 60 of these aircraft.

219
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,940
Therefore, what they've done is, before they've even taken delivery of the first

220
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,900
of these aircraft, sell five of them to another company, Voyager Aviation Holdings, which

221
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,380
is then going to lease these aircraft back to Breeze.

222
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,060
This means Breeze is effectively getting the exact aircraft it wants, when it wants, but

223
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,820
functionally they get all the benefits of a lease.

224
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,580
It's to be expected that, as the delivery dates of the rest of the airline's A220

225
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,700
fleet near, the airline will enter into more of these lease-back agreements.

226
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:17,360
Of course this is all a simplistic view of the process of airline entrepreneurship, but

227
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,340
business model selection, funding, certification, and aircraft acquisition are the four largest

228
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,620
hurdles, and improper completion of any one of these is often the source of a startup

229
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,840
airline's eventual failure.

230
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,420
The rest of the process—from hiring staff, finding office space, crafting a marketing

231
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,400
strategy, leasing space at airports, and much, much more—is much less likely to have a

232
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,740
dramatic impact on their odds of success.

233
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,260
Since the era of the emergence of low-cost airlines, there's been little successful

234
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,840
action in airline entrepreneurship.

235
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,320
With a business atmosphere primed for disruption, the next few years will prove whether it's

236
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,800
still possible for new airlines to succeed, or whether the industry is still locked down

237
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,700
by the world's largest airlines.

238
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,920
What this video goes to prove is that, even for the world's toughest tasks, like starting

239
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,640
an airline, there's someone out there doing it successfully.

240
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,540
That's a lot of what the philosophy of Skillshare is based on—they figure that there's nobody

241
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,640
better to teach skills than the people who actually use those skills.

242
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,000
Their classes, of which there are thousands, are taught by real people who actually know

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,040
what they're talking about, so it's a great way to learn for anyone who's creative

244
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,160
and curious—which I'm sure includes all Wendover viewers.

245
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,360
Whether you want to get ahead at work, or find a new passion, Skillshare certainly has

246
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,800
a class for you.

247
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,680
For example, if you want to start out as a YouTuber, you can take the Creative Video

248
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,040
Storytelling and Editing—Making the Most of Stock Footage class by Nikki Stevens, which

249
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,560
is a lot of what us educational creators do.

250
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,120
We can't go to what we're talking about most of the time, and we often can't afford

251
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,280
to animate our whole videos, so we rely on using existing stock footage creatively.

252
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,520
Skillshare is built to be the best place to learn, meaning there are no ads and they're

253
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,440
always launching new classes, so if you have any curiosity at all in gaining a new skill

254
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,820
of any type, check them out with a free trial of Skillshare Premium, which is available
