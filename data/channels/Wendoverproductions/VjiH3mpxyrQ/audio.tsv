10640	13920	Normal times in business are like a road.
13920	18600	For the most part, competitors are all heading in the same direction and, while some might
18600	23840	turn away and try a different path, for the most part, the only way to get ahead is through
23840	28400	brute force—to slowly catch up and take the lead.
28400	30400	That is difficult.
30400	35640	Abnormal times in business, though, when an industry is in crisis, are like a fork in
35640	36640	the road.
36640	41220	The competitors all reach it together and are forced to pick a path.
41220	42720	This levels the playing field.
42720	47060	While the big players have the resources to evaluate the different paths, and might have
47060	52080	experience from times when this has happened before, all companies, big and small, must
52080	58200	pick a path, and at the end of the day, only one is going to work best.
58200	60380	This can be an equalizer.
60380	65380	It stress tests the big incumbent firms to see if they're still the strongest, or riding
65380	69960	on inertia, and gives smaller players the opportunity to make bold choices that could
69960	72040	put them ahead.
72040	75360	This is what's happening in the airline industry right now.
75360	80400	It's one of the clusters of companies that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, had
80400	85900	to almost entirely shut down, and is now in the process of turning back on and reinventing
85900	91340	itself to capture a new set of consumers with new needs and wants.
91340	95820	Industry turmoil is happening, and that means that there's a case to be made that we're
95820	100080	at that fork in the road, that all airlines are having to pick a path, and that this could
100080	103380	lead to a shuffling of the rank and order of the industry.
103380	108780	There's a case to be made that right now, for the first time in a long time, there's
108780	111180	real opportunity for something new.
111180	115860	There's opportunity for airline entrepreneurship.
115860	121500	If you were tasked with starting an accounting business, or a coffee shop, or a landscaping
121500	125860	business, you'd probably know roughly what you needed to do to start—you'd need to
125860	131340	get a license, or a retail space, or some lawnmowers—and, with enough initiative
131340	135940	and a little bit of luck, you'd probably even have a real shot at successfully starting
135940	137460	any one of these.
137460	142640	Meanwhile, if you were tasked with starting an airline, you and I both know that, no matter
142640	148420	your luck or initiative, you'd have almost no shot of ever taking off.
148420	153540	Due to its complexity and capital intensity, successful airline entrepreneurship is one
153540	159320	of the most difficult endeavors in business, but it is something that, occasionally, real
159320	162240	people actually do.
162240	163640	So what does it take?
163640	166760	What is step one of forming a new airline?
166760	170400	Well, first an airline needs a business model.
170400	175400	Now, everything for startup airlines nowadays builds off of what makes them unique, and
175400	178200	new airlines have to be unique.
178200	182900	You see, fundamentally, for a new company to succeed, they need to do something better
182900	188140	than their competitors—they need to be cheaper, faster, more convenient, or just do something
188140	189700	that others do not.
189700	193460	If they don't, then why would customers choose to switch to them?
193460	198840	The competitive advantage of major airlines is that they are major—is that you can get
198840	203720	on one of their planes on one side of the world and, after a few connections, get off
203720	204900	on the other.
204900	209520	The problem is that almost all of the major full-service network carriers, as those in
209520	213500	the industry will call them, were formed in the early days of commercial aviation and
213500	215320	grew as the industry did.
215320	220140	Today, it would just be effectively impossible for an airline to launch with enough scale
220140	225400	to compete directly with United, British Airways, or Singapore Airlines, and if they didn't,
225400	229500	the legacy airlines would crush them faster than they could get to the necessary scale
229500	232900	for their competitive advantage to be considered their size.
232900	237960	Of the ten largest airlines in the US, none were founded in the current century, and in
237960	244260	Europe, only one was—Wizz Air, which nobody would consider a full-service network carrier.
244260	249460	In fact, globally, one of the only examples of a full-service network carrier established
249460	253960	within the past few decades without government support is Virgin Australia, and in their
253960	256920	case, it was almost by accident.
256920	261520	The collapse of Ansett Australia, which was the country's only major full-service network
261520	266260	carrier at the time, left a massive void in Australia's aviation market only a year
266260	270860	into Virgin Australia's operations, which gave the company the opportunity to grow quite
270860	272820	quickly and effectively.
272820	278280	However, even this example gives further credence to the theory that it's nearly impossible
278280	283780	for a new major full-service network carrier to emerge in the 21st century, as Virgin Australia
283780	289920	entered administration in 2020, and is now exiting as a smaller, primarily domestic airline—seeding
289920	293300	the international market to its legacy competitor, Qantas.
293300	300540	So, once again, new airlines need a strong, defined, and unique business model to succeed.
300540	305860	Looking at three of the most promising startup airlines planned to launch in 2021, a strong,
305860	310500	defined, and unique business model is exactly what each of them has.
310860	315340	Flypop, for example, is planning to launch long-haul low-cost flights from the UK to
315340	320540	secondary cities in India without existing non-stop service, such as Amritsar and Ahmedabad,
320540	323940	in order to cater to the Indian diaspora living in the UK.
323940	328900	Meanwhile, Play Airlines is looking to reprise the business model of now-defunct Wow Air,
328900	333700	and was even founded by former Wow executives by focusing on facilitating low-cost transatlantic
333700	336420	travel with connecting itineraries through Iceland.
336460	341140	Then, in what is likely the most promising airline startup of 2021, as its founder previously
341140	345740	launched WestJet, Azul Airways, and JetBlue, Breeze Airways is looking to launch what they
345740	351280	refer to as hub-busting flights on underserved routes in the US, meaning they're identifying
351280	355600	routes without existing non-stop service such as Tulsa to New York or Louisville to Los
355600	359780	Angeles, and capturing demand by setting up non-stop service.
359780	365220	Crucially, each of these three business models do not involve directly competing with full-service
365220	366980	network carriers.
366980	371580	Budget airlines like Play Airlines and Fly Pop tend to expand the pie by offering prices
371580	375940	that stimulate demand from a lower market segment that likely would not regularly fly
375940	380380	on a full-service network carrier, while Breeze Airways will likely most directly compete
380380	385460	with Southwest, as it's the primary incumbent airline that might offer non-stop hub-busting
385460	386600	flights.
386600	391540	In the selection of a business model, not competing against the world's largest airlines
391540	396500	is a good choice, because full-service network carriers have the time and money to start
396500	400780	and win a price war, while startup airlines do not.
400780	406080	That's because it's very difficult for startup airlines to get funding.
406080	411540	There just isn't the appetite for it, because the airline industry has very little upside
411540	412540	for investors.
412540	417860	It goes through massive, dramatic cycles of profit and loss depending on oil prices and
417860	424320	external economic conditions, but even in the best of times, it makes a very thin profit.
424320	429740	Over the past 25 years, even before the Coronavirus pandemic, the industry has hovered around
429740	432740	a 4-5% operating margin.
432740	436660	Investors could just as easily put their money into something more secure, like the railroad
436660	441060	industry, which hovers between a 25 and 30% operating margin.
441060	445740	In fact, that's exactly what investor Warren Buffett has done—he's famously shirked
445740	450460	significant investments in airlines, while taking massive, successful bets on the American
450460	451860	railroad industry.
451860	456300	For this reason, many startup airlines fail before launch simply because they cannot secure
456300	461780	funding, or after launch because they didn't secure enough funding to reach critical mass.
461780	467260	For those three most promising startup airlines of 2021, though, they each have seemingly
467260	469700	found enough money to launch.
469700	475060	Play Airlines secured a $42 million investment from Avianta Capital, which is an Irish investment
475060	479680	fund run by Aslan Whitley-Ryan—a member of an influential aviation family which includes
479680	481420	the founders of Ryanair.
481420	486660	Meanwhile, Flypop's exact investor makeup is less clear, but their largest source of
486660	491100	funding is coming from a UK government fund intended to kickstart innovative businesses
491100	493300	whose launch was affected by COVID.
493300	498500	Finally, Breeze took the most traditional funding path, having raised $83.3 million
498500	503020	through the venture capital industry, but that was likely only possible due to its founders'
503020	507200	remarkably consistent track record of successful airline startups.
507200	511860	The only consistency with startup airline funding is inconsistency.
511860	516660	Unlike other industries, where there is often a defined ecosystem of investors willing and
516660	521360	sometimes competing to fund startups with a strong business model, plan, executive team,
521360	525460	and proof of concept, you just don't have that with airlines.
525460	530220	The tiny number of new entrants, plus the general lack of appetite from investors, means
530220	535340	that finding funding to complete the extraordinarily expensive tasks required to set up an airline
535340	540360	is itself the task that prevents most from reaching takeoff.
540360	545340	One of those extraordinarily expensive tasks involves quite simply gaining the legal right
545340	547300	to operate an airline.
547300	552180	Every national aviation authority issues what are typically called air operator certificates,
552180	555940	which allows a company to use their aircraft for commercial purposes.
555940	561020	In the US, there are essentially two choices of certificate type for scheduled airlines.
561020	566380	The first, and simpler one, is a Part 135 certificate—referring to the section of
566380	570980	the US's federal aviation regulations that outline this certificate's operating requirements.
570980	577220	Now, a Part 135 certificate is primarily used for cargo and passenger charter operations,
577220	582380	which often includes private jet operations, but it can also be used for certain scheduled
582380	583380	operations.
584100	588780	This certificate only allows the use of aircraft with nine passenger seats or fewer on scheduled
588780	591340	operations, with a few exceptions.
591340	596580	One of the largest Part 135 scheduled airlines in the US, for example, is Cape Air, which
596580	601700	operates a fleet of 94 nine-seat aircraft to primarily small, government-subsidized
601700	604840	destinations around the US and Caribbean.
604840	609140	Because they are on a Part 135 certificate, they can do things like operate flights with
609140	613860	a single pilot, even though in practice most of their flights operate with two pilots,
613860	618500	whereas a Part 121 certificate holder, like United Airlines, for example, would need two
618500	623740	pilots even to operate the exact same aircraft on the exact same route.
623740	629220	In general, the regulations for Part 135 operations are slightly less stringent, and that also
629220	633020	means that attaining this license is a lot easier.
633020	638300	Airlines apparently average between $35,000 and $95,000 in legal fees, plus an additional
638300	642780	$50,000 in expenses to attain a Part 135 certificate.
642780	649760	Meanwhile, getting a Part 121 air operator certificate is much, much more difficult.
649760	654520	These are the certificates held by United, American Airlines, Delta, and any other large
654520	659300	commercial airline in the US, and the process to attain one is so complicated that it's
659300	664540	essentially impossible without hiring a third-party consultancy to assist.
664540	670540	This in and of itself is such a niche process that there are only six FAA-endorsed Part
670540	674260	121 certification consultancies in existence.
674260	680620	After all, there are only 104 active Part 121 airlines in the US, so a new certification
680620	683100	is a fairly rare occurrence.
683100	688300	While none of the FAA-endorsed certification consultancies publicize prices, a non-endorsed
688300	693540	competitor lists their consulting fee as $1.2 million, which includes things like creating
693540	697580	an operations manual, trading management, setting up electronic flight bags, establishing
697580	701920	a drug and alcohol testing program, and almost everything else needed prior to application,
701920	705340	plus the management of the process of actually applying itself.
705340	710640	In general, the reason this application process is so strenuous is because a startup airline
710640	714920	must set up the internal infrastructure for all the extensive safety programs needed to
714920	720300	pass the FAA's review, and then it must present a massive packet of documents proving
720300	723280	that it has done all these things.
723280	728520	Given the complexity of this process, some airlines decide to purchase, rather than apply
728520	731240	for, an air operator certificate.
731240	734420	This is what Breeze Airways initially planned to do.
734420	738600	In July, they applied for the US Department of Transportation to transfer the certificate
738600	743420	of now-defunct Compass Airlines to them, but they eventually dropped this plan due to pushback
743420	746620	from other airlines and Compass' pilot's union.
746620	750340	Now Breeze is going through the process of applying for its own air operator certificate,
750340	755660	but it goes to show that buying an existing one is a very real possibility, and it's
755660	759420	something that happens fairly frequently with Part 135 certificates.
759420	765340	In fact, there are even websites listing small Part 135 airlines for sale, which can be bought
765340	768140	specifically for their certificates.
768140	772620	Around the world, while each country's exact process is different, certification is quite
772620	777860	often a major hurdle for a new airline, as each country's air regulator needs to see
777860	782720	that the startup is fit to fly before giving them their stamp of approval.
782720	787460	Of course, these previous steps—of deciding on a business model, finding funding, and
787460	792140	attaining an air operator certificate—have nothing to do with the most fundamental thing
792140	795140	an airline needs to operate—airplanes.
795140	801700	Now, somewhat counterintuitively, acquiring airplanes is actually one of the simpler phases
801700	804100	of the airline startup process.
804100	810980	The reason why this is is because, quite often, airlines don't actually own aircraft themselves.
810980	816020	This is part of the reason why Breeze, for example, can launch with only about $90 million
816020	820660	in funding, despite the fact that a single one of their planned flagship aircraft, the
820660	824820	A220-300, has a list price of about $90 million.
824820	830540	Rather, a startup airline like Breeze tends to use one of two techniques.
830540	833060	The first option is to lease.
833060	837660	This works essentially like a car lease, just on a much larger scale.
837660	842380	Some 50% of commercial aircraft globally are under-lease, and this option is often more
842380	844740	popular with smaller airlines.
844740	849780	The advantages of leasing aircraft are straightforward—it spreads out the cost, without the need to take
849780	854420	on debt, and it reduces risk, as lease terms can be shorter than the useful life of an
854420	858180	aircraft, and there can be some options to return aircraft before the end of their lease
858180	860140	if there's no longer the need.
860140	865620	In addition, leasing aircraft allows airlines to get aircraft faster.
865620	869580	Aircraft manufacturers often have a multi-year backlog.
869580	875820	Airbus, for example, as of December 2020, has a 7,000 aircraft order backlog, meaning
875820	880740	an airline ordering an aircraft today wouldn't receive it for many years.
880740	885540	Lessors often have aircraft available within months or even weeks, making this the attractive
885540	887300	option for startups.
887300	893500	Also, particularly nowadays, COVID has made getting an airplane on lease easier.
893500	897700	Existing airlines have been downsizing their fleets and getting rid of older, less fuel-efficient
897700	898920	aircraft.
898920	904180	In the case of American Airlines and Air Canada, that meant retiring 20 and 14, respectively,
904180	906120	of their E190 aircraft.
906120	911500	It so happens that Breeze is launching with E190 aircraft and, even though they aren't
911500	916420	directly leasing the retired aircraft of American and Air Canada, more aircraft of a type in
916420	919700	the marketplace pushes prices down.
919700	924300	There is, however, another mechanism increasingly used by airlines, especially when they need
924300	928620	to get newer aircraft for which there isn't a large second-hand market.
928620	934220	Breeze, for example, has an order with Airbus for 60 A220-300 aircraft.
934220	940280	Now, this order is directly from Breeze to Airbus, but Breeze themselves could never
940280	942820	pay for 60 of these aircraft.
942820	946940	Therefore, what they've done is, before they've even taken delivery of the first
946940	951900	of these aircraft, sell five of them to another company, Voyager Aviation Holdings, which
951900	955380	is then going to lease these aircraft back to Breeze.
955380	960060	This means Breeze is effectively getting the exact aircraft it wants, when it wants, but
960060	962820	functionally they get all the benefits of a lease.
962820	967580	It's to be expected that, as the delivery dates of the rest of the airline's A220
967580	972700	fleet near, the airline will enter into more of these lease-back agreements.
972700	977360	Of course this is all a simplistic view of the process of airline entrepreneurship, but
977360	983340	business model selection, funding, certification, and aircraft acquisition are the four largest
983340	988620	hurdles, and improper completion of any one of these is often the source of a startup
988620	990840	airline's eventual failure.
990840	995420	The rest of the process—from hiring staff, finding office space, crafting a marketing
995420	1000400	strategy, leasing space at airports, and much, much more—is much less likely to have a
1000400	1003740	dramatic impact on their odds of success.
1003740	1008260	Since the era of the emergence of low-cost airlines, there's been little successful
1008260	1010840	action in airline entrepreneurship.
1010840	1015320	With a business atmosphere primed for disruption, the next few years will prove whether it's
1015320	1020800	still possible for new airlines to succeed, or whether the industry is still locked down
1020800	1024700	by the world's largest airlines.
1024700	1028920	What this video goes to prove is that, even for the world's toughest tasks, like starting
1028920	1032640	an airline, there's someone out there doing it successfully.
1032640	1038540	That's a lot of what the philosophy of Skillshare is based on—they figure that there's nobody
1038540	1042640	better to teach skills than the people who actually use those skills.
1042640	1047000	Their classes, of which there are thousands, are taught by real people who actually know
1047000	1051040	what they're talking about, so it's a great way to learn for anyone who's creative
1051040	1055160	and curious—which I'm sure includes all Wendover viewers.
1055160	1059360	Whether you want to get ahead at work, or find a new passion, Skillshare certainly has
1059360	1060800	a class for you.
1060800	1064680	For example, if you want to start out as a YouTuber, you can take the Creative Video
1064680	1069040	Storytelling and Editing—Making the Most of Stock Footage class by Nikki Stevens, which
1069040	1071560	is a lot of what us educational creators do.
1071560	1075120	We can't go to what we're talking about most of the time, and we often can't afford
1075120	1080280	to animate our whole videos, so we rely on using existing stock footage creatively.
1080280	1084520	Skillshare is built to be the best place to learn, meaning there are no ads and they're
