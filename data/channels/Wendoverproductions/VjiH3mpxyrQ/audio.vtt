00:10.640 --> 00:13.920
Normal times in business are like a road.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.600
For the most part, competitors are all heading in the same direction and, while some might

00:18.600 --> 00:23.840
turn away and try a different path, for the most part, the only way to get ahead is through

00:23.840 --> 00:28.400
brute force—to slowly catch up and take the lead.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.400
That is difficult.

00:30.400 --> 00:35.640
Abnormal times in business, though, when an industry is in crisis, are like a fork in

00:35.640 --> 00:36.640
the road.

00:36.640 --> 00:41.220
The competitors all reach it together and are forced to pick a path.

00:41.220 --> 00:42.720
This levels the playing field.

00:42.720 --> 00:47.060
While the big players have the resources to evaluate the different paths, and might have

00:47.060 --> 00:52.080
experience from times when this has happened before, all companies, big and small, must

00:52.080 --> 00:58.200
pick a path, and at the end of the day, only one is going to work best.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.380
This can be an equalizer.

01:00.380 --> 01:05.380
It stress tests the big incumbent firms to see if they're still the strongest, or riding

01:05.380 --> 01:09.960
on inertia, and gives smaller players the opportunity to make bold choices that could

01:09.960 --> 01:12.040
put them ahead.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.360
This is what's happening in the airline industry right now.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.400
It's one of the clusters of companies that, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, had

01:20.400 --> 01:25.900
to almost entirely shut down, and is now in the process of turning back on and reinventing

01:25.900 --> 01:31.340
itself to capture a new set of consumers with new needs and wants.

01:31.340 --> 01:35.820
Industry turmoil is happening, and that means that there's a case to be made that we're

01:35.820 --> 01:40.080
at that fork in the road, that all airlines are having to pick a path, and that this could

01:40.080 --> 01:43.380
lead to a shuffling of the rank and order of the industry.

01:43.380 --> 01:48.780
There's a case to be made that right now, for the first time in a long time, there's

01:48.780 --> 01:51.180
real opportunity for something new.

01:51.180 --> 01:55.860
There's opportunity for airline entrepreneurship.

01:55.860 --> 02:01.500
If you were tasked with starting an accounting business, or a coffee shop, or a landscaping

02:01.500 --> 02:05.860
business, you'd probably know roughly what you needed to do to start—you'd need to

02:05.860 --> 02:11.340
get a license, or a retail space, or some lawnmowers—and, with enough initiative

02:11.340 --> 02:15.940
and a little bit of luck, you'd probably even have a real shot at successfully starting

02:15.940 --> 02:17.460
any one of these.

02:17.460 --> 02:22.640
Meanwhile, if you were tasked with starting an airline, you and I both know that, no matter

02:22.640 --> 02:28.420
your luck or initiative, you'd have almost no shot of ever taking off.

02:28.420 --> 02:33.540
Due to its complexity and capital intensity, successful airline entrepreneurship is one

02:33.540 --> 02:39.320
of the most difficult endeavors in business, but it is something that, occasionally, real

02:39.320 --> 02:42.240
people actually do.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.640
So what does it take?

02:43.640 --> 02:46.760
What is step one of forming a new airline?

02:46.760 --> 02:50.400
Well, first an airline needs a business model.

02:50.400 --> 02:55.400
Now, everything for startup airlines nowadays builds off of what makes them unique, and

02:55.400 --> 02:58.200
new airlines have to be unique.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.900
You see, fundamentally, for a new company to succeed, they need to do something better

03:02.900 --> 03:08.140
than their competitors—they need to be cheaper, faster, more convenient, or just do something

03:08.140 --> 03:09.700
that others do not.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.460
If they don't, then why would customers choose to switch to them?

03:13.460 --> 03:18.840
The competitive advantage of major airlines is that they are major—is that you can get

03:18.840 --> 03:23.720
on one of their planes on one side of the world and, after a few connections, get off

03:23.720 --> 03:24.900
on the other.

03:24.900 --> 03:29.520
The problem is that almost all of the major full-service network carriers, as those in

03:29.520 --> 03:33.500
the industry will call them, were formed in the early days of commercial aviation and

03:33.500 --> 03:35.320
grew as the industry did.

03:35.320 --> 03:40.140
Today, it would just be effectively impossible for an airline to launch with enough scale

03:40.140 --> 03:45.400
to compete directly with United, British Airways, or Singapore Airlines, and if they didn't,

03:45.400 --> 03:49.500
the legacy airlines would crush them faster than they could get to the necessary scale

03:49.500 --> 03:52.900
for their competitive advantage to be considered their size.

03:52.900 --> 03:57.960
Of the ten largest airlines in the US, none were founded in the current century, and in

03:57.960 --> 04:04.260
Europe, only one was—Wizz Air, which nobody would consider a full-service network carrier.

04:04.260 --> 04:09.460
In fact, globally, one of the only examples of a full-service network carrier established

04:09.460 --> 04:13.960
within the past few decades without government support is Virgin Australia, and in their

04:13.960 --> 04:16.920
case, it was almost by accident.

04:16.920 --> 04:21.520
The collapse of Ansett Australia, which was the country's only major full-service network

04:21.520 --> 04:26.260
carrier at the time, left a massive void in Australia's aviation market only a year

04:26.260 --> 04:30.860
into Virgin Australia's operations, which gave the company the opportunity to grow quite

04:30.860 --> 04:32.820
quickly and effectively.

04:32.820 --> 04:38.280
However, even this example gives further credence to the theory that it's nearly impossible

04:38.280 --> 04:43.780
for a new major full-service network carrier to emerge in the 21st century, as Virgin Australia

04:43.780 --> 04:49.920
entered administration in 2020, and is now exiting as a smaller, primarily domestic airline—seeding

04:49.920 --> 04:53.300
the international market to its legacy competitor, Qantas.

04:53.300 --> 05:00.540
So, once again, new airlines need a strong, defined, and unique business model to succeed.

05:00.540 --> 05:05.860
Looking at three of the most promising startup airlines planned to launch in 2021, a strong,

05:05.860 --> 05:10.500
defined, and unique business model is exactly what each of them has.

05:10.860 --> 05:15.340
Flypop, for example, is planning to launch long-haul low-cost flights from the UK to

05:15.340 --> 05:20.540
secondary cities in India without existing non-stop service, such as Amritsar and Ahmedabad,

05:20.540 --> 05:23.940
in order to cater to the Indian diaspora living in the UK.

05:23.940 --> 05:28.900
Meanwhile, Play Airlines is looking to reprise the business model of now-defunct Wow Air,

05:28.900 --> 05:33.700
and was even founded by former Wow executives by focusing on facilitating low-cost transatlantic

05:33.700 --> 05:36.420
travel with connecting itineraries through Iceland.

05:36.460 --> 05:41.140
Then, in what is likely the most promising airline startup of 2021, as its founder previously

05:41.140 --> 05:45.740
launched WestJet, Azul Airways, and JetBlue, Breeze Airways is looking to launch what they

05:45.740 --> 05:51.280
refer to as hub-busting flights on underserved routes in the US, meaning they're identifying

05:51.280 --> 05:55.600
routes without existing non-stop service such as Tulsa to New York or Louisville to Los

05:55.600 --> 05:59.780
Angeles, and capturing demand by setting up non-stop service.

05:59.780 --> 06:05.220
Crucially, each of these three business models do not involve directly competing with full-service

06:05.220 --> 06:06.980
network carriers.

06:06.980 --> 06:11.580
Budget airlines like Play Airlines and Fly Pop tend to expand the pie by offering prices

06:11.580 --> 06:15.940
that stimulate demand from a lower market segment that likely would not regularly fly

06:15.940 --> 06:20.380
on a full-service network carrier, while Breeze Airways will likely most directly compete

06:20.380 --> 06:25.460
with Southwest, as it's the primary incumbent airline that might offer non-stop hub-busting

06:25.460 --> 06:26.600
flights.

06:26.600 --> 06:31.540
In the selection of a business model, not competing against the world's largest airlines

06:31.540 --> 06:36.500
is a good choice, because full-service network carriers have the time and money to start

06:36.500 --> 06:40.780
and win a price war, while startup airlines do not.

06:40.780 --> 06:46.080
That's because it's very difficult for startup airlines to get funding.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.540
There just isn't the appetite for it, because the airline industry has very little upside

06:51.540 --> 06:52.540
for investors.

06:52.540 --> 06:57.860
It goes through massive, dramatic cycles of profit and loss depending on oil prices and

06:57.860 --> 07:04.320
external economic conditions, but even in the best of times, it makes a very thin profit.

07:04.320 --> 07:09.740
Over the past 25 years, even before the Coronavirus pandemic, the industry has hovered around

07:09.740 --> 07:12.740
a 4-5% operating margin.

07:12.740 --> 07:16.660
Investors could just as easily put their money into something more secure, like the railroad

07:16.660 --> 07:21.060
industry, which hovers between a 25 and 30% operating margin.

07:21.060 --> 07:25.740
In fact, that's exactly what investor Warren Buffett has done—he's famously shirked

07:25.740 --> 07:30.460
significant investments in airlines, while taking massive, successful bets on the American

07:30.460 --> 07:31.860
railroad industry.

07:31.860 --> 07:36.300
For this reason, many startup airlines fail before launch simply because they cannot secure

07:36.300 --> 07:41.780
funding, or after launch because they didn't secure enough funding to reach critical mass.

07:41.780 --> 07:47.260
For those three most promising startup airlines of 2021, though, they each have seemingly

07:47.260 --> 07:49.700
found enough money to launch.

07:49.700 --> 07:55.060
Play Airlines secured a $42 million investment from Avianta Capital, which is an Irish investment

07:55.060 --> 07:59.680
fund run by Aslan Whitley-Ryan—a member of an influential aviation family which includes

07:59.680 --> 08:01.420
the founders of Ryanair.

08:01.420 --> 08:06.660
Meanwhile, Flypop's exact investor makeup is less clear, but their largest source of

08:06.660 --> 08:11.100
funding is coming from a UK government fund intended to kickstart innovative businesses

08:11.100 --> 08:13.300
whose launch was affected by COVID.

08:13.300 --> 08:18.500
Finally, Breeze took the most traditional funding path, having raised $83.3 million

08:18.500 --> 08:23.020
through the venture capital industry, but that was likely only possible due to its founders'

08:23.020 --> 08:27.200
remarkably consistent track record of successful airline startups.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.860
The only consistency with startup airline funding is inconsistency.

08:31.860 --> 08:36.660
Unlike other industries, where there is often a defined ecosystem of investors willing and

08:36.660 --> 08:41.360
sometimes competing to fund startups with a strong business model, plan, executive team,

08:41.360 --> 08:45.460
and proof of concept, you just don't have that with airlines.

08:45.460 --> 08:50.220
The tiny number of new entrants, plus the general lack of appetite from investors, means

08:50.220 --> 08:55.340
that finding funding to complete the extraordinarily expensive tasks required to set up an airline

08:55.340 --> 09:00.360
is itself the task that prevents most from reaching takeoff.

09:00.360 --> 09:05.340
One of those extraordinarily expensive tasks involves quite simply gaining the legal right

09:05.340 --> 09:07.300
to operate an airline.

09:07.300 --> 09:12.180
Every national aviation authority issues what are typically called air operator certificates,

09:12.180 --> 09:15.940
which allows a company to use their aircraft for commercial purposes.

09:15.940 --> 09:21.020
In the US, there are essentially two choices of certificate type for scheduled airlines.

09:21.020 --> 09:26.380
The first, and simpler one, is a Part 135 certificate—referring to the section of

09:26.380 --> 09:30.980
the US's federal aviation regulations that outline this certificate's operating requirements.

09:30.980 --> 09:37.220
Now, a Part 135 certificate is primarily used for cargo and passenger charter operations,

09:37.220 --> 09:42.380
which often includes private jet operations, but it can also be used for certain scheduled

09:42.380 --> 09:43.380
operations.

09:44.100 --> 09:48.780
This certificate only allows the use of aircraft with nine passenger seats or fewer on scheduled

09:48.780 --> 09:51.340
operations, with a few exceptions.

09:51.340 --> 09:56.580
One of the largest Part 135 scheduled airlines in the US, for example, is Cape Air, which

09:56.580 --> 10:01.700
operates a fleet of 94 nine-seat aircraft to primarily small, government-subsidized

10:01.700 --> 10:04.840
destinations around the US and Caribbean.

10:04.840 --> 10:09.140
Because they are on a Part 135 certificate, they can do things like operate flights with

10:09.140 --> 10:13.860
a single pilot, even though in practice most of their flights operate with two pilots,

10:13.860 --> 10:18.500
whereas a Part 121 certificate holder, like United Airlines, for example, would need two

10:18.500 --> 10:23.740
pilots even to operate the exact same aircraft on the exact same route.

10:23.740 --> 10:29.220
In general, the regulations for Part 135 operations are slightly less stringent, and that also

10:29.220 --> 10:33.020
means that attaining this license is a lot easier.

10:33.020 --> 10:38.300
Airlines apparently average between $35,000 and $95,000 in legal fees, plus an additional

10:38.300 --> 10:42.780
$50,000 in expenses to attain a Part 135 certificate.

10:42.780 --> 10:49.760
Meanwhile, getting a Part 121 air operator certificate is much, much more difficult.

10:49.760 --> 10:54.520
These are the certificates held by United, American Airlines, Delta, and any other large

10:54.520 --> 10:59.300
commercial airline in the US, and the process to attain one is so complicated that it's

10:59.300 --> 11:04.540
essentially impossible without hiring a third-party consultancy to assist.

11:04.540 --> 11:10.540
This in and of itself is such a niche process that there are only six FAA-endorsed Part

11:10.540 --> 11:14.260
121 certification consultancies in existence.

11:14.260 --> 11:20.620
After all, there are only 104 active Part 121 airlines in the US, so a new certification

11:20.620 --> 11:23.100
is a fairly rare occurrence.

11:23.100 --> 11:28.300
While none of the FAA-endorsed certification consultancies publicize prices, a non-endorsed

11:28.300 --> 11:33.540
competitor lists their consulting fee as $1.2 million, which includes things like creating

11:33.540 --> 11:37.580
an operations manual, trading management, setting up electronic flight bags, establishing

11:37.580 --> 11:41.920
a drug and alcohol testing program, and almost everything else needed prior to application,

11:41.920 --> 11:45.340
plus the management of the process of actually applying itself.

11:45.340 --> 11:50.640
In general, the reason this application process is so strenuous is because a startup airline

11:50.640 --> 11:54.920
must set up the internal infrastructure for all the extensive safety programs needed to

11:54.920 --> 12:00.300
pass the FAA's review, and then it must present a massive packet of documents proving

12:00.300 --> 12:03.280
that it has done all these things.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.520
Given the complexity of this process, some airlines decide to purchase, rather than apply

12:08.520 --> 12:11.240
for, an air operator certificate.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.420
This is what Breeze Airways initially planned to do.

12:14.420 --> 12:18.600
In July, they applied for the US Department of Transportation to transfer the certificate

12:18.600 --> 12:23.420
of now-defunct Compass Airlines to them, but they eventually dropped this plan due to pushback

12:23.420 --> 12:26.620
from other airlines and Compass' pilot's union.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.340
Now Breeze is going through the process of applying for its own air operator certificate,

12:30.340 --> 12:35.660
but it goes to show that buying an existing one is a very real possibility, and it's

12:35.660 --> 12:39.420
something that happens fairly frequently with Part 135 certificates.

12:39.420 --> 12:45.340
In fact, there are even websites listing small Part 135 airlines for sale, which can be bought

12:45.340 --> 12:48.140
specifically for their certificates.

12:48.140 --> 12:52.620
Around the world, while each country's exact process is different, certification is quite

12:52.620 --> 12:57.860
often a major hurdle for a new airline, as each country's air regulator needs to see

12:57.860 --> 13:02.720
that the startup is fit to fly before giving them their stamp of approval.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.460
Of course, these previous steps—of deciding on a business model, finding funding, and

13:07.460 --> 13:12.140
attaining an air operator certificate—have nothing to do with the most fundamental thing

13:12.140 --> 13:15.140
an airline needs to operate—airplanes.

13:15.140 --> 13:21.700
Now, somewhat counterintuitively, acquiring airplanes is actually one of the simpler phases

13:21.700 --> 13:24.100
of the airline startup process.

13:24.100 --> 13:30.980
The reason why this is is because, quite often, airlines don't actually own aircraft themselves.

13:30.980 --> 13:36.020
This is part of the reason why Breeze, for example, can launch with only about $90 million

13:36.020 --> 13:40.660
in funding, despite the fact that a single one of their planned flagship aircraft, the

13:40.660 --> 13:44.820
A220-300, has a list price of about $90 million.

13:44.820 --> 13:50.540
Rather, a startup airline like Breeze tends to use one of two techniques.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.060
The first option is to lease.

13:53.060 --> 13:57.660
This works essentially like a car lease, just on a much larger scale.

13:57.660 --> 14:02.380
Some 50% of commercial aircraft globally are under-lease, and this option is often more

14:02.380 --> 14:04.740
popular with smaller airlines.

14:04.740 --> 14:09.780
The advantages of leasing aircraft are straightforward—it spreads out the cost, without the need to take

14:09.780 --> 14:14.420
on debt, and it reduces risk, as lease terms can be shorter than the useful life of an

14:14.420 --> 14:18.180
aircraft, and there can be some options to return aircraft before the end of their lease

14:18.180 --> 14:20.140
if there's no longer the need.

14:20.140 --> 14:25.620
In addition, leasing aircraft allows airlines to get aircraft faster.

14:25.620 --> 14:29.580
Aircraft manufacturers often have a multi-year backlog.

14:29.580 --> 14:35.820
Airbus, for example, as of December 2020, has a 7,000 aircraft order backlog, meaning

14:35.820 --> 14:40.740
an airline ordering an aircraft today wouldn't receive it for many years.

14:40.740 --> 14:45.540
Lessors often have aircraft available within months or even weeks, making this the attractive

14:45.540 --> 14:47.300
option for startups.

14:47.300 --> 14:53.500
Also, particularly nowadays, COVID has made getting an airplane on lease easier.

14:53.500 --> 14:57.700
Existing airlines have been downsizing their fleets and getting rid of older, less fuel-efficient

14:57.700 --> 14:58.920
aircraft.

14:58.920 --> 15:04.180
In the case of American Airlines and Air Canada, that meant retiring 20 and 14, respectively,

15:04.180 --> 15:06.120
of their E190 aircraft.

15:06.120 --> 15:11.500
It so happens that Breeze is launching with E190 aircraft and, even though they aren't

15:11.500 --> 15:16.420
directly leasing the retired aircraft of American and Air Canada, more aircraft of a type in

15:16.420 --> 15:19.700
the marketplace pushes prices down.

15:19.700 --> 15:24.300
There is, however, another mechanism increasingly used by airlines, especially when they need

15:24.300 --> 15:28.620
to get newer aircraft for which there isn't a large second-hand market.

15:28.620 --> 15:34.220
Breeze, for example, has an order with Airbus for 60 A220-300 aircraft.

15:34.220 --> 15:40.280
Now, this order is directly from Breeze to Airbus, but Breeze themselves could never

15:40.280 --> 15:42.820
pay for 60 of these aircraft.

15:42.820 --> 15:46.940
Therefore, what they've done is, before they've even taken delivery of the first

15:46.940 --> 15:51.900
of these aircraft, sell five of them to another company, Voyager Aviation Holdings, which

15:51.900 --> 15:55.380
is then going to lease these aircraft back to Breeze.

15:55.380 --> 16:00.060
This means Breeze is effectively getting the exact aircraft it wants, when it wants, but

16:00.060 --> 16:02.820
functionally they get all the benefits of a lease.

16:02.820 --> 16:07.580
It's to be expected that, as the delivery dates of the rest of the airline's A220

16:07.580 --> 16:12.700
fleet near, the airline will enter into more of these lease-back agreements.

16:12.700 --> 16:17.360
Of course this is all a simplistic view of the process of airline entrepreneurship, but

16:17.360 --> 16:23.340
business model selection, funding, certification, and aircraft acquisition are the four largest

16:23.340 --> 16:28.620
hurdles, and improper completion of any one of these is often the source of a startup

16:28.620 --> 16:30.840
airline's eventual failure.

16:30.840 --> 16:35.420
The rest of the process—from hiring staff, finding office space, crafting a marketing

16:35.420 --> 16:40.400
strategy, leasing space at airports, and much, much more—is much less likely to have a

16:40.400 --> 16:43.740
dramatic impact on their odds of success.

16:43.740 --> 16:48.260
Since the era of the emergence of low-cost airlines, there's been little successful

16:48.260 --> 16:50.840
action in airline entrepreneurship.

16:50.840 --> 16:55.320
With a business atmosphere primed for disruption, the next few years will prove whether it's

16:55.320 --> 17:00.800
still possible for new airlines to succeed, or whether the industry is still locked down

17:00.800 --> 17:04.700
by the world's largest airlines.

17:04.700 --> 17:08.920
What this video goes to prove is that, even for the world's toughest tasks, like starting

17:08.920 --> 17:12.640
an airline, there's someone out there doing it successfully.

17:12.640 --> 17:18.540
That's a lot of what the philosophy of Skillshare is based on—they figure that there's nobody

17:18.540 --> 17:22.640
better to teach skills than the people who actually use those skills.

17:22.640 --> 17:27.000
Their classes, of which there are thousands, are taught by real people who actually know

17:27.000 --> 17:31.040
what they're talking about, so it's a great way to learn for anyone who's creative

17:31.040 --> 17:35.160
and curious—which I'm sure includes all Wendover viewers.

17:35.160 --> 17:39.360
Whether you want to get ahead at work, or find a new passion, Skillshare certainly has

17:39.360 --> 17:40.800
a class for you.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.680
For example, if you want to start out as a YouTuber, you can take the Creative Video

17:44.680 --> 17:49.040
Storytelling and Editing—Making the Most of Stock Footage class by Nikki Stevens, which

17:49.040 --> 17:51.560
is a lot of what us educational creators do.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.120
We can't go to what we're talking about most of the time, and we often can't afford

17:55.120 --> 18:00.280
to animate our whole videos, so we rely on using existing stock footage creatively.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.520
Skillshare is built to be the best place to learn, meaning there are no ads and they're

18:04.520 --> 18:09.440
always launching new classes, so if you have any curiosity at all in gaining a new skill

18:09.440 --> 18:13.820
of any type, check them out with a free trial of Skillshare Premium, which is available

18:13.820 --> 18:17.280
