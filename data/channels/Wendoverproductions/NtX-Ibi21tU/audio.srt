3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,480
Why do you walk outside?

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,120
You know it's risky, right?

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,460
Don't you value your life?

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,520
Or rather, how much do you value your life?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,160
Could the answer be infinite?

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,120
Could your life be worth everything to you?

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,120
After all, most people would say that they gain nothing from losing their life, and therefore,

10
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,800
the value of their life, to themselves, must be infinite.

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
But that can't be true.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,920
Your life cannot be of infinite value to yourself because, if that were the case, you would

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,220
never walk outside.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,520
Walking outside is risky.

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,400
Every time you set foot on the sidewalk, you elevate the chances that imminently, your

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,260
life will end.

17
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,480
So why do you walk outside?

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,840
Risk is the balance of negatives and positives.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,620
For you or anyone to consider a risk to be acceptable, the positives must outweigh the

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
negatives.

21
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:11,180
For example, in a given year, an American has a 1 in 55,000 chance of dying by being

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,140
hit by a car while walking down the street.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,020
If you valued your life infinitely, that infinite value would be multiplied by your chance of

24
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,440
death—1 in 55,000 per year—to create the total negative value of walking outside, but

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,520
of course, infinity times anything is infinity, so you can't possibly value your life infinitely

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,000
because you do walk outside.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,200
You somehow decide that that 1 in 55,000 chance of death is worth it for whatever you gain

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,280
from walking down the street.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,600
This is the process of risk evaluation and, for absolutely every decision you make, you

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,640
subconsciously balance the negatives and positives.

31
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,480
Let's ask another question.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,820
Would you personally drive a car?

33
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,800
Most every person would answer yes.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,080
We even know how many people would answer yes because two-thirds of all Americans have

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,720
a driver's license.

36
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,700
So, follow-up question.

37
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,280
Would you personally go mountain biking?

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,220
Would you consider that to be too risky—to bring you a little too close to death?

39
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,680
Not all, and probably not most, but many more would answer no.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,160
This is something that has come up time and time again as mountain biking has gained popularity

41
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,060
and schools have tried to add it to their roster of sports, but parents and administrators

42
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,240
said no.

43
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,880
They said that it was far too dangerous of a sport—that the risk of injury or death

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,880
was unacceptable.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,560
However, in a given year, the odds of death while driving for a given licensed driver

46
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,800
in the US is 1 in 600.

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,100
Meanwhile, the odds of death while mountain biking for a given mountain biker is about

48
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,600
1 in 30,000.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,440
Is that what you would have expected?

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,680
Prior to these statistics, would you have earnestly thought that this, something you

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,880
see every day or possibly do every day, is more dangerous than something you watch people

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,320
do online in awe?

53
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,200
Most people would say no.

54
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,760
So how are people's risk perceptions so wrong?

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:20,060
What makes driving an acceptable risk to nearly everyone but mountain biking an unacceptable

56
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,480
risk to many?

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,440
Well, it's simple.

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,220
Engrained in our brains are flawed processes for evaluating risk.

59
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,840
For certain reasons, what we fear will kill us and what will actually kill us are very,

60
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
very different.

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,760
These are the rules of our flawed human risk evaluation system.

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,340
Rule one—voluntary risks are more acceptable than involuntary risks.

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,480
That is to say, people are far more tolerant of risks that they can choose to engage in

64
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
than those they can't.

65
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,520
That's why most of the population will happily drive a car with a 1 in 600 annual risk of

66
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,400
death, but if a food preservative was introduced that had the same level of risk, there would

67
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,320
be mass outcry.

68
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,080
In fact, studies have shown that people are roughly 1,000 times more tolerant of voluntary

69
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,200
risk than involuntary.

70
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,120
The perception of choice is powerful.

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,280
That means that if measures are introduced that make an involuntary risk seem voluntary,

72
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,140
the risk is more tolerated, even if those measures have little real effect on the average

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,640
overall risk.

74
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,480
This gets tricky with activities that are somewhere in between voluntary and involuntary.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,360
Say, for example, a company is polluting the air in a town.

76
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,840
This seems like an involuntary risk.

77
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,520
You can't, after all, choose to not breathe the polluted air in, however, consider how

78
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,960
communication can reframe this.

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,800
The factory owner might say, you can always move away, or buy an air filter, or stay inside

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,540
on bad air days.

81
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,120
If you give people ways that seem to control their personal exposure to an involuntary

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,560
risk, they might start to believe that it is a voluntary risk.

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,640
Not only does this potentially increase the tolerance of those exposed to the risk, it

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,720
will also increase the tolerance of the bystanders not exposed.

85
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,120
They might think, those people are choosing to stay there, and not use an air filter,

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,380
and go outside.

87
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,760
The blame is slowly shifted on the individual, rather than on the originator of the risk.

88
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,360
The overall danger from something can stay exactly the same, but give people a semblance

89
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,000
of control over it, and they will tolerate it.

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,360
Rule two—acceptance is inversely proportional to prevalence.

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,780
The more people who are exposed to a given risk, the less the public will accept it.

92
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,120
We can accept the huge risk of space travel, with only a tiny number of people partaking,

93
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,860
yet we could not accept if air travel had the same level of risk.

94
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:55,960
Both are voluntary activities, but there are two parallel effects taking place here—fewer

95
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,040
people will engage in higher risk activities, and fewer people will tolerate high exposure

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,320
risks.

97
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,800
This effect is also why the risk tolerance for things like vaccines, which are distributed

98
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,080
to hundreds of millions or billions of people, is so dramatically lower than the risk tolerance

99
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,240
of experimental medicines, which are distributed to a small and select number of individuals.

100
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,480
Rule three—disease is a yardstick.

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,160
It's been shown that average human risk acceptance roughly correlates to whether an

102
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,000
activity is more or less deadly than one's chance of death from disease.

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,280
What's possibly happening here is that humans have accepted the likelihood of their

104
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,280
death by the hands of disease, so partaking in anything riskier than disease is unconscionable

105
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,940
because it then makes it more likely to die from that other activity than disease.

106
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,480
It changes one's statistically predetermined end.

107
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,740
For example, the researcher who defined this rule found that the average risk of death

108
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,400
per hour for a soldier fighting in the Vietnam War was roughly equal to the average risk

109
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,440
of dying per hour from disease as a human.

110
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,600
Therefore, the general public more or less accepted the risk of those fighting there.

111
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,680
This disregards the fact that the risk for the individual soldiers fighting in the Vietnam

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
of dying from disease was, at their average age, dramatically lower than the overall population

113
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
average, which is skewed heavily by those in old age, but it didn't matter because

114
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,680
the public's yardstick is disease.

115
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Riskier is not okay.

116
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,280
Less risky, it's okay.

117
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,080
Rule 4—Novelty Increases Perceived Risk.

118
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,660
We fear what is new and not yet understood.

119
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,760
As understanding goes up, perceived risk goes down, and as understanding goes down, perceived

120
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,500
risk goes up.

121
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,860
For example, in one now-famous 1970s study, college students were asked to rank 30 activities

122
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,220
and technologies from most to least risky—simple as that.

123
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,580
In the end, on average, they ranked nuclear power as the riskiest of these 30, above cars,

124
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,420
handguns, smoking, and everything else.

125
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,940
Then, experts, whose risk perception was shown in separate research to closely match real

126
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,740
risk, ranked the same list of 30.

127
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,780
To them, nuclear power was the 20th most risky activity or technology on the list.

128
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:22,620
Meanwhile, non-nuclear electric power was 19th on the college students list but 9th

129
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,180
on the experts list.

130
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,920
The college students overestimated the risk of nuclear power and underestimated the risk

131
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
of electric power.

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,580
So, what's the difference between nuclear and non-nuclear electric power?

133
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,940
Well, normal electric power had been widespread for a century at the time when this research

134
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,460
was done.

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,360
Nuclear power, meanwhile, was just gaining prevalence.

136
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,940
This risk perception study was done before the well-known meltdowns at Three Mile Island

137
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,660
and Chernobyl—just single digits of people had died directly from nuclear energy incidents

138
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,860
at the time, yet people feared it more than cars, which killed 50,000 people in the US

139
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,900
in the year when they were surveyed.

140
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,640
Today, four decades later, risk perception of nuclear power is greatly reduced because

141
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,900
it is no longer new.

142
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,820
Younger people now learn how nuclear power works in school, and older people have a longer

143
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,620
period of evidence for the risk level of nuclear power.

144
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,660
Understanding leads to acceptance.

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,380
Rule five—numbers are numbing.

146
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,340
The value of saving one human life should be half of the value of saving two human lives,

147
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,260
and then the value of saving two human lives should be half of saving four human lives,

148
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,940
and so on and so forth.

149
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,320
That's intuitive, that makes sense.

150
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,820
Each life is, on average, worth saving as much as the next meaning that a graph, with

151
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,640
the number of lives saved on the x-axis and the value of lives saved on the y, should

152
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,860
look like this—a straight line.

153
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,460
There's even an argument that, going a level deeper, the graph should look like this, since

154
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,260
large-scale loss of life has a more widespread negative societal effect.

155
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:04,820
Losing a million lives would be more than a million times worse than losing one life,

156
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,940
for a society.

157
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,180
So, the graph should look either like this or this.

158
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,240
However, if you change this graph from what humans logically agree on to what they perceive

159
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,560
psychologically, research shows it looks like this.

160
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,380
Humans perceive that saving the 1,000th life is less worth it than saving the first life,

161
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,820
even though logically, they are of equal value.

162
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,340
This can partially explain how people can tolerate mass-casualty natural disasters or

163
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,580
pandemics or genocides with little more concern than they do small terrorist attacks.

164
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,900
While this phenomenon doesn't make logical sense, it does make some psychological sense

165
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,540
because it lines up with how people perceive other quantifiable collections.

166
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,460
For example, humans value a dollar less the more they earn—your first dollar is worth

167
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,020
far more than your millionth to your mind, even though a dollar is still worth a dollar.

168
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,200
In the context of human life, though, this is more destructive.

169
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,500
Humans can't comprehend mass tragedy through statistics, so they are not an effective means

170
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,060
of communication for those purposes.

171
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:18,900
It is for this reason why people might underestimate the risk that causes mass-casualty events.

172
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,940
These rules and others all combine to create a simple truth.

173
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,940
The way we, as a collective, perceive risk is wrong.

174
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,220
We overestimate the danger of low-risk activities, underestimate the danger of high-risk activities,

175
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,140
we think things that we like are less risky, we conflate unfair danger with higher danger—this

176
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,260
perceptual package works so that the perceived risk swings wildly above and below actual

177
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,260
risk.

178
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,760
We just can't trust ourselves.

179
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,620
We can think, earnestly, that a risk has increased, but it hasn't, or that it's decreased,

180
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,220
but it hasn't.

181
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,800
Considering that we, the general public, cannot reasonably know how risky something is is

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,700
exactly why life itself is risky.

183
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,700
While science and statistics might know the risk, we don't, so whether we're actually

184
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,980
engaging in acceptable risk is a crapshoot.

185
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,680
Normally, this isn't something worth stressing about—our flawed risk-perception systems

186
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,260
will average out through time to make something similar to real risk.

187
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,500
The only time it's really worth considering is when people are making decisions about

188
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,540
risk that affects others.

189
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:33,040
When people, somehow, get to decide what risk others face, perception is dangerous, because

190
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:41,640
it can silently and unknowingly eclipse science, statistics, and fact.

191
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,560
Your online identity is now more visible than ever, so it's worth making sure you present

192
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,140
yourself right.

193
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,900
There are two key first steps to that.

194
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,640
Number one is having a website with a custom domain, and number two is having an email

195
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,840
hosted at that domain.

196
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,360
Hover helps you with both of these steps starting with helping you get a unique domain with

197
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,920
their over 400 extensions.

198
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,180
They sell these at very fair prices, and then you can add a custom email ending in that

199
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,840
domain for a little bit more.

200
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,480
Even if you don't have the time to set up your website now, it's worth getting the

201
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,360
domain corresponding to your name or business now because, at any moment, someone could

202
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,440
take it.

203
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,840
With Hover, you can easily set it up to redirect to your LinkedIn page or YouTube channel or

204
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,000
Twitter account or anything, so that you can easily direct people to your web presence.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,160
This is all made easier by the fact that, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you

206
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,560
can get 10% off Hover's already fair prices with your first purchase, and you'll be

207
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,640
supporting Wendover while you're at it.
