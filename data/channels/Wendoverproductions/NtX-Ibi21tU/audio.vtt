00:08.780 --> 00:11.480
Why do you walk outside?

00:11.480 --> 00:13.120
You know it's risky, right?

00:13.120 --> 00:15.460
Don't you value your life?

00:15.460 --> 00:19.520
Or rather, how much do you value your life?

00:19.520 --> 00:21.160
Could the answer be infinite?

00:21.160 --> 00:24.120
Could your life be worth everything to you?

00:24.120 --> 00:29.120
After all, most people would say that they gain nothing from losing their life, and therefore,

00:29.120 --> 00:33.800
the value of their life, to themselves, must be infinite.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.800
But that can't be true.

00:35.800 --> 00:40.920
Your life cannot be of infinite value to yourself because, if that were the case, you would

00:40.920 --> 00:43.220
never walk outside.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.520
Walking outside is risky.

00:45.520 --> 00:50.400
Every time you set foot on the sidewalk, you elevate the chances that imminently, your

00:50.400 --> 00:52.260
life will end.

00:52.260 --> 00:55.480
So why do you walk outside?

00:55.480 --> 00:58.840
Risk is the balance of negatives and positives.

00:58.840 --> 01:04.620
For you or anyone to consider a risk to be acceptable, the positives must outweigh the

01:04.620 --> 01:05.620
negatives.

01:05.620 --> 01:11.180
For example, in a given year, an American has a 1 in 55,000 chance of dying by being

01:11.180 --> 01:14.140
hit by a car while walking down the street.

01:14.140 --> 01:19.020
If you valued your life infinitely, that infinite value would be multiplied by your chance of

01:19.020 --> 01:25.440
death—1 in 55,000 per year—to create the total negative value of walking outside, but

01:25.440 --> 01:32.520
of course, infinity times anything is infinity, so you can't possibly value your life infinitely

01:32.520 --> 01:35.000
because you do walk outside.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.200
You somehow decide that that 1 in 55,000 chance of death is worth it for whatever you gain

01:41.200 --> 01:43.280
from walking down the street.

01:43.280 --> 01:48.600
This is the process of risk evaluation and, for absolutely every decision you make, you

01:48.600 --> 01:51.640
subconsciously balance the negatives and positives.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.480
Let's ask another question.

01:54.520 --> 01:57.820
Would you personally drive a car?

01:57.820 --> 01:59.800
Most every person would answer yes.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.080
We even know how many people would answer yes because two-thirds of all Americans have

02:04.080 --> 02:05.720
a driver's license.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.700
So, follow-up question.

02:07.700 --> 02:10.280
Would you personally go mountain biking?

02:10.280 --> 02:16.220
Would you consider that to be too risky—to bring you a little too close to death?

02:16.220 --> 02:21.680
Not all, and probably not most, but many more would answer no.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.160
This is something that has come up time and time again as mountain biking has gained popularity

02:26.160 --> 02:31.060
and schools have tried to add it to their roster of sports, but parents and administrators

02:31.060 --> 02:32.240
said no.

02:32.240 --> 02:37.880
They said that it was far too dangerous of a sport—that the risk of injury or death

02:37.880 --> 02:38.880
was unacceptable.

02:38.880 --> 02:44.560
However, in a given year, the odds of death while driving for a given licensed driver

02:44.560 --> 02:47.800
in the US is 1 in 600.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.100
Meanwhile, the odds of death while mountain biking for a given mountain biker is about

02:52.100 --> 02:54.600
1 in 30,000.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.440
Is that what you would have expected?

02:57.440 --> 03:01.680
Prior to these statistics, would you have earnestly thought that this, something you

03:01.680 --> 03:06.880
see every day or possibly do every day, is more dangerous than something you watch people

03:06.880 --> 03:09.320
do online in awe?

03:09.320 --> 03:11.200
Most people would say no.

03:11.200 --> 03:14.760
So how are people's risk perceptions so wrong?

03:14.760 --> 03:20.060
What makes driving an acceptable risk to nearly everyone but mountain biking an unacceptable

03:20.060 --> 03:21.480
risk to many?

03:21.480 --> 03:23.440
Well, it's simple.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.220
Engrained in our brains are flawed processes for evaluating risk.

03:28.220 --> 03:33.840
For certain reasons, what we fear will kill us and what will actually kill us are very,

03:33.840 --> 03:35.840
very different.

03:35.840 --> 03:41.760
These are the rules of our flawed human risk evaluation system.

03:41.760 --> 03:47.340
Rule one—voluntary risks are more acceptable than involuntary risks.

03:47.340 --> 03:52.480
That is to say, people are far more tolerant of risks that they can choose to engage in

03:52.480 --> 03:53.720
than those they can't.

03:53.720 --> 03:59.520
That's why most of the population will happily drive a car with a 1 in 600 annual risk of

03:59.520 --> 04:04.400
death, but if a food preservative was introduced that had the same level of risk, there would

04:04.400 --> 04:06.320
be mass outcry.

04:06.320 --> 04:11.080
In fact, studies have shown that people are roughly 1,000 times more tolerant of voluntary

04:11.080 --> 04:13.200
risk than involuntary.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.120
The perception of choice is powerful.

04:16.120 --> 04:21.280
That means that if measures are introduced that make an involuntary risk seem voluntary,

04:21.280 --> 04:26.140
the risk is more tolerated, even if those measures have little real effect on the average

04:26.140 --> 04:27.640
overall risk.

04:27.640 --> 04:32.480
This gets tricky with activities that are somewhere in between voluntary and involuntary.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.360
Say, for example, a company is polluting the air in a town.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.840
This seems like an involuntary risk.

04:39.840 --> 04:44.520
You can't, after all, choose to not breathe the polluted air in, however, consider how

04:44.520 --> 04:46.960
communication can reframe this.

04:46.960 --> 04:52.800
The factory owner might say, you can always move away, or buy an air filter, or stay inside

04:52.800 --> 04:54.540
on bad air days.

04:54.540 --> 04:59.120
If you give people ways that seem to control their personal exposure to an involuntary

04:59.120 --> 05:03.560
risk, they might start to believe that it is a voluntary risk.

05:03.560 --> 05:07.640
Not only does this potentially increase the tolerance of those exposed to the risk, it

05:07.640 --> 05:11.720
will also increase the tolerance of the bystanders not exposed.

05:11.720 --> 05:16.120
They might think, those people are choosing to stay there, and not use an air filter,

05:16.120 --> 05:17.380
and go outside.

05:17.380 --> 05:22.760
The blame is slowly shifted on the individual, rather than on the originator of the risk.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.360
The overall danger from something can stay exactly the same, but give people a semblance

05:27.360 --> 05:31.000
of control over it, and they will tolerate it.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.360
Rule two—acceptance is inversely proportional to prevalence.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.780
The more people who are exposed to a given risk, the less the public will accept it.

05:40.780 --> 05:46.120
We can accept the huge risk of space travel, with only a tiny number of people partaking,

05:46.120 --> 05:50.860
yet we could not accept if air travel had the same level of risk.

05:50.860 --> 05:55.960
Both are voluntary activities, but there are two parallel effects taking place here—fewer

05:55.960 --> 06:01.040
people will engage in higher risk activities, and fewer people will tolerate high exposure

06:01.040 --> 06:02.320
risks.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.800
This effect is also why the risk tolerance for things like vaccines, which are distributed

06:06.800 --> 06:12.080
to hundreds of millions or billions of people, is so dramatically lower than the risk tolerance

06:12.080 --> 06:18.240
of experimental medicines, which are distributed to a small and select number of individuals.

06:18.240 --> 06:21.480
Rule three—disease is a yardstick.

06:21.480 --> 06:26.160
It's been shown that average human risk acceptance roughly correlates to whether an

06:26.160 --> 06:31.000
activity is more or less deadly than one's chance of death from disease.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.280
What's possibly happening here is that humans have accepted the likelihood of their

06:35.280 --> 06:41.280
death by the hands of disease, so partaking in anything riskier than disease is unconscionable

06:41.280 --> 06:46.940
because it then makes it more likely to die from that other activity than disease.

06:46.940 --> 06:50.480
It changes one's statistically predetermined end.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.740
For example, the researcher who defined this rule found that the average risk of death

06:54.740 --> 06:59.400
per hour for a soldier fighting in the Vietnam War was roughly equal to the average risk

06:59.400 --> 07:02.440
of dying per hour from disease as a human.

07:02.440 --> 07:07.600
Therefore, the general public more or less accepted the risk of those fighting there.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.680
This disregards the fact that the risk for the individual soldiers fighting in the Vietnam

07:11.680 --> 07:16.720
of dying from disease was, at their average age, dramatically lower than the overall population

07:16.720 --> 07:20.800
average, which is skewed heavily by those in old age, but it didn't matter because

07:20.800 --> 07:23.680
the public's yardstick is disease.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.680
Riskier is not okay.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.280
Less risky, it's okay.

07:28.280 --> 07:33.080
Rule 4—Novelty Increases Perceived Risk.

07:33.080 --> 07:36.660
We fear what is new and not yet understood.

07:36.660 --> 07:41.760
As understanding goes up, perceived risk goes down, and as understanding goes down, perceived

07:41.760 --> 07:43.500
risk goes up.

07:43.500 --> 07:48.860
For example, in one now-famous 1970s study, college students were asked to rank 30 activities

07:48.860 --> 07:53.220
and technologies from most to least risky—simple as that.

07:53.220 --> 07:59.580
In the end, on average, they ranked nuclear power as the riskiest of these 30, above cars,

07:59.580 --> 08:02.420
handguns, smoking, and everything else.

08:02.420 --> 08:07.940
Then, experts, whose risk perception was shown in separate research to closely match real

08:07.940 --> 08:10.740
risk, ranked the same list of 30.

08:10.740 --> 08:16.780
To them, nuclear power was the 20th most risky activity or technology on the list.

08:16.780 --> 08:22.620
Meanwhile, non-nuclear electric power was 19th on the college students list but 9th

08:22.620 --> 08:24.180
on the experts list.

08:24.180 --> 08:28.920
The college students overestimated the risk of nuclear power and underestimated the risk

08:28.920 --> 08:29.920
of electric power.

08:29.920 --> 08:34.580
So, what's the difference between nuclear and non-nuclear electric power?

08:34.580 --> 08:39.940
Well, normal electric power had been widespread for a century at the time when this research

08:39.940 --> 08:41.460
was done.

08:41.460 --> 08:45.360
Nuclear power, meanwhile, was just gaining prevalence.

08:45.360 --> 08:49.940
This risk perception study was done before the well-known meltdowns at Three Mile Island

08:49.940 --> 08:54.660
and Chernobyl—just single digits of people had died directly from nuclear energy incidents

08:54.660 --> 08:59.860
at the time, yet people feared it more than cars, which killed 50,000 people in the US

08:59.860 --> 09:01.900
in the year when they were surveyed.

09:01.900 --> 09:07.640
Today, four decades later, risk perception of nuclear power is greatly reduced because

09:07.640 --> 09:09.900
it is no longer new.

09:09.900 --> 09:13.820
Younger people now learn how nuclear power works in school, and older people have a longer

09:13.820 --> 09:17.620
period of evidence for the risk level of nuclear power.

09:17.620 --> 09:20.660
Understanding leads to acceptance.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.380
Rule five—numbers are numbing.

09:24.380 --> 09:30.340
The value of saving one human life should be half of the value of saving two human lives,

09:30.340 --> 09:35.260
and then the value of saving two human lives should be half of saving four human lives,

09:35.260 --> 09:36.940
and so on and so forth.

09:36.940 --> 09:39.320
That's intuitive, that makes sense.

09:39.320 --> 09:43.820
Each life is, on average, worth saving as much as the next meaning that a graph, with

09:43.820 --> 09:48.640
the number of lives saved on the x-axis and the value of lives saved on the y, should

09:48.640 --> 09:50.860
look like this—a straight line.

09:50.860 --> 09:55.460
There's even an argument that, going a level deeper, the graph should look like this, since

09:55.460 --> 10:00.260
large-scale loss of life has a more widespread negative societal effect.

10:00.260 --> 10:04.820
Losing a million lives would be more than a million times worse than losing one life,

10:04.820 --> 10:05.940
for a society.

10:05.940 --> 10:10.180
So, the graph should look either like this or this.

10:10.180 --> 10:15.240
However, if you change this graph from what humans logically agree on to what they perceive

10:15.240 --> 10:19.560
psychologically, research shows it looks like this.

10:19.560 --> 10:25.380
Humans perceive that saving the 1,000th life is less worth it than saving the first life,

10:25.380 --> 10:28.820
even though logically, they are of equal value.

10:28.820 --> 10:33.340
This can partially explain how people can tolerate mass-casualty natural disasters or

10:33.340 --> 10:38.580
pandemics or genocides with little more concern than they do small terrorist attacks.

10:39.100 --> 10:43.900
While this phenomenon doesn't make logical sense, it does make some psychological sense

10:43.900 --> 10:48.540
because it lines up with how people perceive other quantifiable collections.

10:48.540 --> 10:53.460
For example, humans value a dollar less the more they earn—your first dollar is worth

10:53.460 --> 10:59.020
far more than your millionth to your mind, even though a dollar is still worth a dollar.

10:59.020 --> 11:03.200
In the context of human life, though, this is more destructive.

11:03.200 --> 11:08.500
Humans can't comprehend mass tragedy through statistics, so they are not an effective means

11:08.500 --> 11:11.060
of communication for those purposes.

11:11.060 --> 11:18.900
It is for this reason why people might underestimate the risk that causes mass-casualty events.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.940
These rules and others all combine to create a simple truth.

11:22.940 --> 11:26.940
The way we, as a collective, perceive risk is wrong.

11:26.940 --> 11:32.220
We overestimate the danger of low-risk activities, underestimate the danger of high-risk activities,

11:32.220 --> 11:37.140
we think things that we like are less risky, we conflate unfair danger with higher danger—this

11:37.180 --> 11:42.260
perceptual package works so that the perceived risk swings wildly above and below actual

11:42.260 --> 11:43.260
risk.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.760
We just can't trust ourselves.

11:45.760 --> 11:51.620
We can think, earnestly, that a risk has increased, but it hasn't, or that it's decreased,

11:51.620 --> 11:53.220
but it hasn't.

11:53.220 --> 11:57.800
Considering that we, the general public, cannot reasonably know how risky something is is

11:57.800 --> 12:00.700
exactly why life itself is risky.

12:00.700 --> 12:05.700
While science and statistics might know the risk, we don't, so whether we're actually

12:05.700 --> 12:08.980
engaging in acceptable risk is a crapshoot.

12:08.980 --> 12:14.680
Normally, this isn't something worth stressing about—our flawed risk-perception systems

12:14.680 --> 12:19.260
will average out through time to make something similar to real risk.

12:19.260 --> 12:23.500
The only time it's really worth considering is when people are making decisions about

12:23.500 --> 12:26.540
risk that affects others.

12:26.540 --> 12:33.040
When people, somehow, get to decide what risk others face, perception is dangerous, because

12:33.040 --> 12:41.640
it can silently and unknowingly eclipse science, statistics, and fact.

12:41.640 --> 12:46.560
Your online identity is now more visible than ever, so it's worth making sure you present

12:46.560 --> 12:48.140
yourself right.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.900
There are two key first steps to that.

12:50.900 --> 12:55.640
Number one is having a website with a custom domain, and number two is having an email

12:55.640 --> 12:57.840
hosted at that domain.

12:57.840 --> 13:02.360
Hover helps you with both of these steps starting with helping you get a unique domain with

13:02.360 --> 13:04.920
their over 400 extensions.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.180
They sell these at very fair prices, and then you can add a custom email ending in that

13:09.180 --> 13:10.840
domain for a little bit more.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.480
Even if you don't have the time to set up your website now, it's worth getting the

13:14.480 --> 13:19.360
domain corresponding to your name or business now because, at any moment, someone could

13:19.360 --> 13:20.440
take it.

13:20.440 --> 13:24.840
With Hover, you can easily set it up to redirect to your LinkedIn page or YouTube channel or

13:24.840 --> 13:30.000
Twitter account or anything, so that you can easily direct people to your web presence.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.160
This is all made easier by the fact that, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you

13:34.160 --> 13:38.560
can get 10% off Hover's already fair prices with your first purchase, and you'll be

13:38.560 --> 13:40.640
supporting Wendover while you're at it.
