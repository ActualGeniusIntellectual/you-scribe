8780	11480	Why do you walk outside?
11480	13120	You know it's risky, right?
13120	15460	Don't you value your life?
15460	19520	Or rather, how much do you value your life?
19520	21160	Could the answer be infinite?
21160	24120	Could your life be worth everything to you?
24120	29120	After all, most people would say that they gain nothing from losing their life, and therefore,
29120	33800	the value of their life, to themselves, must be infinite.
33800	35800	But that can't be true.
35800	40920	Your life cannot be of infinite value to yourself because, if that were the case, you would
40920	43220	never walk outside.
43220	45520	Walking outside is risky.
45520	50400	Every time you set foot on the sidewalk, you elevate the chances that imminently, your
50400	52260	life will end.
52260	55480	So why do you walk outside?
55480	58840	Risk is the balance of negatives and positives.
58840	64620	For you or anyone to consider a risk to be acceptable, the positives must outweigh the
64620	65620	negatives.
65620	71180	For example, in a given year, an American has a 1 in 55,000 chance of dying by being
71180	74140	hit by a car while walking down the street.
74140	79020	If you valued your life infinitely, that infinite value would be multiplied by your chance of
79020	85440	death—1 in 55,000 per year—to create the total negative value of walking outside, but
85440	92520	of course, infinity times anything is infinity, so you can't possibly value your life infinitely
92520	95000	because you do walk outside.
95000	101200	You somehow decide that that 1 in 55,000 chance of death is worth it for whatever you gain
101200	103280	from walking down the street.
103280	108600	This is the process of risk evaluation and, for absolutely every decision you make, you
108600	111640	subconsciously balance the negatives and positives.
111640	114480	Let's ask another question.
114520	117820	Would you personally drive a car?
117820	119800	Most every person would answer yes.
119800	124080	We even know how many people would answer yes because two-thirds of all Americans have
124080	125720	a driver's license.
125720	127700	So, follow-up question.
127700	130280	Would you personally go mountain biking?
130280	136220	Would you consider that to be too risky—to bring you a little too close to death?
136220	141680	Not all, and probably not most, but many more would answer no.
141680	146160	This is something that has come up time and time again as mountain biking has gained popularity
146160	151060	and schools have tried to add it to their roster of sports, but parents and administrators
151060	152240	said no.
152240	157880	They said that it was far too dangerous of a sport—that the risk of injury or death
157880	158880	was unacceptable.
158880	164560	However, in a given year, the odds of death while driving for a given licensed driver
164560	167800	in the US is 1 in 600.
167800	172100	Meanwhile, the odds of death while mountain biking for a given mountain biker is about
172100	174600	1 in 30,000.
174600	177440	Is that what you would have expected?
177440	181680	Prior to these statistics, would you have earnestly thought that this, something you
181680	186880	see every day or possibly do every day, is more dangerous than something you watch people
186880	189320	do online in awe?
189320	191200	Most people would say no.
191200	194760	So how are people's risk perceptions so wrong?
194760	200060	What makes driving an acceptable risk to nearly everyone but mountain biking an unacceptable
200060	201480	risk to many?
201480	203440	Well, it's simple.
203440	208220	Engrained in our brains are flawed processes for evaluating risk.
208220	213840	For certain reasons, what we fear will kill us and what will actually kill us are very,
213840	215840	very different.
215840	221760	These are the rules of our flawed human risk evaluation system.
221760	227340	Rule one—voluntary risks are more acceptable than involuntary risks.
227340	232480	That is to say, people are far more tolerant of risks that they can choose to engage in
232480	233720	than those they can't.
233720	239520	That's why most of the population will happily drive a car with a 1 in 600 annual risk of
239520	244400	death, but if a food preservative was introduced that had the same level of risk, there would
244400	246320	be mass outcry.
246320	251080	In fact, studies have shown that people are roughly 1,000 times more tolerant of voluntary
251080	253200	risk than involuntary.
253200	256120	The perception of choice is powerful.
256120	261280	That means that if measures are introduced that make an involuntary risk seem voluntary,
261280	266140	the risk is more tolerated, even if those measures have little real effect on the average
266140	267640	overall risk.
267640	272480	This gets tricky with activities that are somewhere in between voluntary and involuntary.
272480	277360	Say, for example, a company is polluting the air in a town.
277360	279840	This seems like an involuntary risk.
279840	284520	You can't, after all, choose to not breathe the polluted air in, however, consider how
284520	286960	communication can reframe this.
286960	292800	The factory owner might say, you can always move away, or buy an air filter, or stay inside
292800	294540	on bad air days.
294540	299120	If you give people ways that seem to control their personal exposure to an involuntary
299120	303560	risk, they might start to believe that it is a voluntary risk.
303560	307640	Not only does this potentially increase the tolerance of those exposed to the risk, it
307640	311720	will also increase the tolerance of the bystanders not exposed.
311720	316120	They might think, those people are choosing to stay there, and not use an air filter,
316120	317380	and go outside.
317380	322760	The blame is slowly shifted on the individual, rather than on the originator of the risk.
322760	327360	The overall danger from something can stay exactly the same, but give people a semblance
327360	331000	of control over it, and they will tolerate it.
331000	335360	Rule two—acceptance is inversely proportional to prevalence.
335880	340780	The more people who are exposed to a given risk, the less the public will accept it.
340780	346120	We can accept the huge risk of space travel, with only a tiny number of people partaking,
346120	350860	yet we could not accept if air travel had the same level of risk.
350860	355960	Both are voluntary activities, but there are two parallel effects taking place here—fewer
355960	361040	people will engage in higher risk activities, and fewer people will tolerate high exposure
361040	362320	risks.
362320	366800	This effect is also why the risk tolerance for things like vaccines, which are distributed
366800	372080	to hundreds of millions or billions of people, is so dramatically lower than the risk tolerance
372080	378240	of experimental medicines, which are distributed to a small and select number of individuals.
378240	381480	Rule three—disease is a yardstick.
381480	386160	It's been shown that average human risk acceptance roughly correlates to whether an
386160	391000	activity is more or less deadly than one's chance of death from disease.
391000	395280	What's possibly happening here is that humans have accepted the likelihood of their
395280	401280	death by the hands of disease, so partaking in anything riskier than disease is unconscionable
401280	406940	because it then makes it more likely to die from that other activity than disease.
406940	410480	It changes one's statistically predetermined end.
410480	414740	For example, the researcher who defined this rule found that the average risk of death
414740	419400	per hour for a soldier fighting in the Vietnam War was roughly equal to the average risk
419400	422440	of dying per hour from disease as a human.
422440	427600	Therefore, the general public more or less accepted the risk of those fighting there.
427600	431680	This disregards the fact that the risk for the individual soldiers fighting in the Vietnam
431680	436720	of dying from disease was, at their average age, dramatically lower than the overall population
436720	440800	average, which is skewed heavily by those in old age, but it didn't matter because
440800	443680	the public's yardstick is disease.
443680	445680	Riskier is not okay.
445680	448280	Less risky, it's okay.
448280	453080	Rule 4—Novelty Increases Perceived Risk.
453080	456660	We fear what is new and not yet understood.
456660	461760	As understanding goes up, perceived risk goes down, and as understanding goes down, perceived
461760	463500	risk goes up.
463500	468860	For example, in one now-famous 1970s study, college students were asked to rank 30 activities
468860	473220	and technologies from most to least risky—simple as that.
473220	479580	In the end, on average, they ranked nuclear power as the riskiest of these 30, above cars,
479580	482420	handguns, smoking, and everything else.
482420	487940	Then, experts, whose risk perception was shown in separate research to closely match real
487940	490740	risk, ranked the same list of 30.
490740	496780	To them, nuclear power was the 20th most risky activity or technology on the list.
496780	502620	Meanwhile, non-nuclear electric power was 19th on the college students list but 9th
502620	504180	on the experts list.
504180	508920	The college students overestimated the risk of nuclear power and underestimated the risk
508920	509920	of electric power.
509920	514580	So, what's the difference between nuclear and non-nuclear electric power?
514580	519940	Well, normal electric power had been widespread for a century at the time when this research
519940	521460	was done.
521460	525360	Nuclear power, meanwhile, was just gaining prevalence.
525360	529940	This risk perception study was done before the well-known meltdowns at Three Mile Island
529940	534660	and Chernobyl—just single digits of people had died directly from nuclear energy incidents
534660	539860	at the time, yet people feared it more than cars, which killed 50,000 people in the US
539860	541900	in the year when they were surveyed.
541900	547640	Today, four decades later, risk perception of nuclear power is greatly reduced because
547640	549900	it is no longer new.
549900	553820	Younger people now learn how nuclear power works in school, and older people have a longer
553820	557620	period of evidence for the risk level of nuclear power.
557620	560660	Understanding leads to acceptance.
560660	564380	Rule five—numbers are numbing.
564380	570340	The value of saving one human life should be half of the value of saving two human lives,
570340	575260	and then the value of saving two human lives should be half of saving four human lives,
575260	576940	and so on and so forth.
576940	579320	That's intuitive, that makes sense.
579320	583820	Each life is, on average, worth saving as much as the next meaning that a graph, with
583820	588640	the number of lives saved on the x-axis and the value of lives saved on the y, should
588640	590860	look like this—a straight line.
590860	595460	There's even an argument that, going a level deeper, the graph should look like this, since
595460	600260	large-scale loss of life has a more widespread negative societal effect.
600260	604820	Losing a million lives would be more than a million times worse than losing one life,
604820	605940	for a society.
605940	610180	So, the graph should look either like this or this.
610180	615240	However, if you change this graph from what humans logically agree on to what they perceive
615240	619560	psychologically, research shows it looks like this.
619560	625380	Humans perceive that saving the 1,000th life is less worth it than saving the first life,
625380	628820	even though logically, they are of equal value.
628820	633340	This can partially explain how people can tolerate mass-casualty natural disasters or
633340	638580	pandemics or genocides with little more concern than they do small terrorist attacks.
639100	643900	While this phenomenon doesn't make logical sense, it does make some psychological sense
643900	648540	because it lines up with how people perceive other quantifiable collections.
648540	653460	For example, humans value a dollar less the more they earn—your first dollar is worth
653460	659020	far more than your millionth to your mind, even though a dollar is still worth a dollar.
659020	663200	In the context of human life, though, this is more destructive.
663200	668500	Humans can't comprehend mass tragedy through statistics, so they are not an effective means
668500	671060	of communication for those purposes.
671060	678900	It is for this reason why people might underestimate the risk that causes mass-casualty events.
678900	682940	These rules and others all combine to create a simple truth.
682940	686940	The way we, as a collective, perceive risk is wrong.
686940	692220	We overestimate the danger of low-risk activities, underestimate the danger of high-risk activities,
692220	697140	we think things that we like are less risky, we conflate unfair danger with higher danger—this
697180	702260	perceptual package works so that the perceived risk swings wildly above and below actual
702260	703260	risk.
703260	705760	We just can't trust ourselves.
705760	711620	We can think, earnestly, that a risk has increased, but it hasn't, or that it's decreased,
711620	713220	but it hasn't.
713220	717800	Considering that we, the general public, cannot reasonably know how risky something is is
717800	720700	exactly why life itself is risky.
720700	725700	While science and statistics might know the risk, we don't, so whether we're actually
725700	728980	engaging in acceptable risk is a crapshoot.
728980	734680	Normally, this isn't something worth stressing about—our flawed risk-perception systems
734680	739260	will average out through time to make something similar to real risk.
739260	743500	The only time it's really worth considering is when people are making decisions about
743500	746540	risk that affects others.
746540	753040	When people, somehow, get to decide what risk others face, perception is dangerous, because
753040	761640	it can silently and unknowingly eclipse science, statistics, and fact.
761640	766560	Your online identity is now more visible than ever, so it's worth making sure you present
766560	768140	yourself right.
768140	770900	There are two key first steps to that.
770900	775640	Number one is having a website with a custom domain, and number two is having an email
775640	777840	hosted at that domain.
777840	782360	Hover helps you with both of these steps starting with helping you get a unique domain with
782360	784920	their over 400 extensions.
784920	789180	They sell these at very fair prices, and then you can add a custom email ending in that
789180	790840	domain for a little bit more.
790840	794480	Even if you don't have the time to set up your website now, it's worth getting the
794480	799360	domain corresponding to your name or business now because, at any moment, someone could
799360	800440	take it.
800440	804840	With Hover, you can easily set it up to redirect to your LinkedIn page or YouTube channel or
804840	810000	Twitter account or anything, so that you can easily direct people to your web presence.
810000	814160	This is all made easier by the fact that, by going to hover.com slash wendover, you
814160	818560	can get 10% off Hover's already fair prices with your first purchase, and you'll be
818560	820640	supporting Wendover while you're at it.
