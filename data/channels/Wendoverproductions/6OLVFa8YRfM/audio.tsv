0	5720	This video was made possible by The Crew 2, a new open-world racing game from Ubisoft.
5720	8200	More about it after the video.
8200	11880	No sport is as logistically challenging as motorsports.
11880	17080	While equipment matters in any sport, in motorsport the human is only half the athlete.
17080	19080	The vehicle is the other half.
19080	23520	The performance of a motorsports vehicle is directly tied to having the right components
23520	28260	in the right place at the right time so the logistics are part of the competition.
28260	31700	Racing may be a sport, but it's not all fun and games.
31700	35860	Teams are businesses—businesses that are expected to make money.
35860	42180	The most valuable Formula One team, Scuderia Ferrari, is worth over $1.3 billion.
42180	46880	This means this team is valued at about as much as tech companies Discord, Bird Rides,
46880	47880	or DoorDash.
47880	51840	The wealthier teams, like Ferrari, are able to spend more money on transport to bring
51840	55600	more equipment and spare parts which can make the difference between winning and losing
55600	57300	when things go wrong.
57340	61940	Formula One is by many measures the most international sports competition.
61940	67220	Over its 21 yearly races the teams traverse five continents with as little as a week between
67220	68220	events.
68220	73160	A chaotic ballet of trucks, boats, and planes transports this show across the world each
73160	74160	year.
74160	78980	Ten teams compete in Formula One and despite it taking place worldwide it is by all measures
78980	80420	a European sport.
80420	84160	Eight of the ten teams are registered in and operate out of Europe.
84160	88360	Only the Indian and American teams are from elsewhere although the Indian team is actually
88360	93460	based in the UK while the US team, based in North Carolina, operates a secondary forward
93460	97400	base in the UK so that its staff doesn't have to travel all the way back to the US
97400	101300	between each of the European races which in recent years have been held consecutively
101300	105240	with the brief interruption of the Canadian Grand Prix in the middle of the season over
105240	106240	summer.
106240	110080	Thanks to this, the European leg of the season is, compared to the rest, relatively easy
110080	113280	logistically because within Europe, you can drive.
113280	117840	The cost of shipping by truck is so comparatively low to shipping by plane that teams bring
117840	120820	whole buildings with them to European races.
120820	125020	These buildings are what are modestly referred to as motorhomes but can be as large as Red
125020	129480	Bull's three-story structure that includes offices, bars, and a restaurant with a complete
129480	130480	kitchen.
130480	135520	All of that packs into a number of trucks and can be assembled in less than two days.
135520	139960	Along with all the other equipment including cars, spare parts, and electronics, convoys
139960	145120	of dozens of trucks per team crisscross the continent before each European race.
145120	148640	Typically races are held every two weekends on Sunday which gives teams plenty of time
148640	152760	to relocate before activity begins on the Thursday before the Grand Prix but from time
152760	157000	to time the schedule is crunched and races take place two weekends in a row.
157000	161340	This proves a more daunting logistical challenge as teams only have three full days to break
161340	165980	down, transport, and reassemble their equipment at the new race site.
165980	171180	Even worse, for the first time ever the 2018 season saw three weekends with three races
171180	172180	in a row.
172180	176200	On June 24th, the French Grand Prix took place in Le Castellette and the next weekend the
176200	179800	Austrian one was held in Spielberg finishing off the following weekend with the British
179800	181600	Grand Prix in Silverstone.
181600	187080	The Austria-UK transfer was the most difficult one as it involved driving nearly 1,000 miles
187080	189920	including through the choke point of the Channel Tunnel.
189920	194140	For this trek, each truck was manned by three drivers so that while one drove, the others
194140	197000	could sleep in an RV that accompanied the convoy.
197000	201120	That way, the trucks could drive continuously only stopping to refuel.
201120	206220	But again, these races are easy logistically compared to the ones outside of Europe—the
206220	208800	ones known as fly-away races.
208800	212720	Just like with the European races, a majority of fly-away races occur with two weeks between
212720	217500	them but from time to time races are scheduled on back-to-back weekends thousands of miles
217500	218520	apart.
218520	223320	These back-to-back fly-away races are the most logistically difficult weeks of the Formula
223360	224440	season.
224440	229200	On Sunday, April 8th, 2018, the Bahrain Grand Prix was held in Sakhir, Bahrain then seven
229200	233840	days later, the following weekend, the Chinese Grand Prix was held in Shanghai, China.
233840	238980	Over 4,000 miles separated those two racetracks and yet, just like with every race, everything
238980	244640	came down on Sunday night in Bahrain and had to be operational by Thursday morning in China.
244640	249480	Even worse, Shanghai is five hours ahead of Bahrain which is effectively five hours fewer
249480	254960	to do the work but in reality, the planning for this transfer began months before.
254960	259080	Around January 2018, three months before the first races of the season, each of the ten
259080	262260	teams packed up five sets of shipping containers.
262260	267060	Each of these sets held their sea kits carrying things like chairs, tables, appliances, cooking
267060	269840	utensils, and some elements of their garages.
269840	274080	They send these bulkier and less expensive pieces of equipment by sea as it's massively
274080	276740	less expensive than sending them by plane.
276740	280100	The number of containers per team varies as the wealthier teams like Red Bull will
280100	284740	take more but in general each team takes about three 40-foot containers.
284740	288960	Of course ocean shipping is slower, but since there are five sets there is always one at
288960	291420	the right place at the right time.
291420	295820	That January shipment sent the first five kits to the first five fly-away races—Melbourne
295820	301700	Australia, Sakhir Bahrain, Shanghai, China, Baku, Azerbaijan, and Montreal, Canada.
301700	305640	Then as each race was completed its kit was packed up and sent to the next fly-away race
305640	307440	destination without a kit.
307440	311440	The Australian one went to Singapore, the Bahrainian one to Russia, the Chinese one
311440	316200	to Japan, the Azerbaijani one to the United States, and the Canadian one to Mexico.
316200	319480	And then towards the end of the season, when there are no more tracks to send kits to,
319480	322400	they're sent back to the team's home bases for the winter.
322400	326340	At the race track, the Formula One logistics team's main downtime is actually during
326340	331200	the race itself but for the Bahrain to China transfer real work began the Thursday before
331200	332200	the race.
332200	336300	That's when each team's logistics manager started making their tear-down plan—deciding
336300	340460	in which order and into which containers their different pieces of equipment should go.
340460	344520	Once that was completed, there really was not a lot to do until Sunday.
344520	348580	On Sunday morning, before the race even started, the pack-up began.
348580	351620	Many of the spare parts can't be used during the race—they're not going to replace
351620	355540	an engine during the Grand Prix—so they're the first pieces of kit to be packed into
355540	356540	their containers.
356540	361180	Not much happened during the race itself but within 15 minutes of it ending, the main pack-up
361180	362180	began.
362180	366420	The cars, the most important pieces of equipment, were subjected to a post-race inspection to
366420	370780	be sure no illegal modifications were made but everything else was immediately ready
370780	371780	for packing.
371780	375520	All the equipment that the teams wanted at the destination first were put into one of
375520	377540	three priority pallets.
377540	381820	Together, each team's priority pallets filled up the first plane to Shanghai.
381820	385820	As soon as these were packed, they were driven directly to the airport only a few hours after
385820	389420	the race ended to be prepared for the early morning flight to Shanghai.
389420	393680	As that plane took off, the final pallets were being packed up back at the race track.
393680	397960	Only about six to eight hours after the drop of the checkered flag, all pallets were packed
397960	400280	up and on their way to the airport.
400280	405060	By midday Monday, all six of the Boeing 747s used to transport the team's equipment to
405060	406820	China were in the air.
406820	411340	These planes were chartered by Formula One but the teams still pay for the space.
411340	414960	Also on Monday, all the staff started their journey to Shanghai.
414960	418900	Many of the lower-level staff just flew on normal commercial flights while some of the
418900	422800	higher profile drivers flew private between the two countries.
422800	426960	After nine hours in the air, the first plane touched down in Shanghai around early evening
426960	428100	local time.
428100	430560	The freight was unloaded and brought to customs.
430560	434460	By midnight, all the priority freight was on its way to the race track.
434460	438340	Overnight, logistics workers arranged the different team's freight into their respective
438340	439340	paddocks.
439340	442860	No team is allowed to touch their freight until all the other team's freight has arrived
442860	447060	both for fairness purposes and safety to assure that there aren't many people around as
447060	449340	pallets are being unloaded and moved.
449340	452520	By Tuesday morning, it's game on for the assembly crews.
452520	456460	At this point each team had their three priority pallets and their sea kit.
456460	460580	In their priority pallets, teams didn't put the highest value or most important cargo,
460580	465020	they put the things they needed to assemble first—the bare bones of their garage.
465020	468640	That includes the wall paneling, the core of their electrical system, and the majority
468640	471000	of the IT and communications equipment.
471000	474740	By Tuesday evening that build was done and the track was once again made inaccessible
474740	478580	to the teams as the non-priority pallets were delivered overnight.
478580	482820	Early Wednesday morning around 6 AM the teams arrived back at the track and began work on
482820	485020	the final assembly of the garage.
485020	489860	Only after about four hours, by late morning, all the different team's garages were operational.
489860	495020	All in all, ten Formula One teams successfully packed up, shipped all their equipment 4,000
495020	499380	miles, and reassembled their paddocks in 58 hours.
499380	504220	Thanks to careful planning and practiced workers, Formula One pulls off this impressive feat
504220	506980	every year without a hitch.
506980	510960	Earlier in the video I mentioned how the short seven-day Spielberg Austria to Silverstone
510960	515660	UK transfer is the hardest race transfer in Europe but interestingly, about a month ago
515660	520420	Ubisoft brought me out to the Spielberg Formula One track to try out their new racing game,
520420	521460	The Crew 2.
521460	526260	The game is open world meaning that they actually recreated the entire US and you can drive
526260	531720	and race through all of it not only in cars but also motorcycles, boats, and planes.
531720	536160	Even as someone who doesn't play video games much, I enjoyed The Crew 2 a lot and it seemed
536160	540880	an accurate recreation of the actual racing I did that day on the Spielberg track.
540880	544600	If you think you might be interested in playing this, there will be a link in the description
544600	546440	where you can check it out.
546440	550840	Thanks to the support of The Crew 2 and Ubisoft, this video is an extra one so there will be
550840	553360	another Wendover video out next week.
