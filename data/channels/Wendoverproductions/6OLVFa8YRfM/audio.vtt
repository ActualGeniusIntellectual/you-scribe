00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
This video was made possible by The Crew 2, a new open-world racing game from Ubisoft.

00:05.720 --> 00:08.200
More about it after the video.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.880
No sport is as logistically challenging as motorsports.

00:11.880 --> 00:17.080
While equipment matters in any sport, in motorsport the human is only half the athlete.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.080
The vehicle is the other half.

00:19.080 --> 00:23.520
The performance of a motorsports vehicle is directly tied to having the right components

00:23.520 --> 00:28.260
in the right place at the right time so the logistics are part of the competition.

00:28.260 --> 00:31.700
Racing may be a sport, but it's not all fun and games.

00:31.700 --> 00:35.860
Teams are businesses—businesses that are expected to make money.

00:35.860 --> 00:42.180
The most valuable Formula One team, Scuderia Ferrari, is worth over $1.3 billion.

00:42.180 --> 00:46.880
This means this team is valued at about as much as tech companies Discord, Bird Rides,

00:46.880 --> 00:47.880
or DoorDash.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.840
The wealthier teams, like Ferrari, are able to spend more money on transport to bring

00:51.840 --> 00:55.600
more equipment and spare parts which can make the difference between winning and losing

00:55.600 --> 00:57.300
when things go wrong.

00:57.340 --> 01:01.940
Formula One is by many measures the most international sports competition.

01:01.940 --> 01:07.220
Over its 21 yearly races the teams traverse five continents with as little as a week between

01:07.220 --> 01:08.220
events.

01:08.220 --> 01:13.160
A chaotic ballet of trucks, boats, and planes transports this show across the world each

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
year.

01:14.160 --> 01:18.980
Ten teams compete in Formula One and despite it taking place worldwide it is by all measures

01:18.980 --> 01:20.420
a European sport.

01:20.420 --> 01:24.160
Eight of the ten teams are registered in and operate out of Europe.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.360
Only the Indian and American teams are from elsewhere although the Indian team is actually

01:28.360 --> 01:33.460
based in the UK while the US team, based in North Carolina, operates a secondary forward

01:33.460 --> 01:37.400
base in the UK so that its staff doesn't have to travel all the way back to the US

01:37.400 --> 01:41.300
between each of the European races which in recent years have been held consecutively

01:41.300 --> 01:45.240
with the brief interruption of the Canadian Grand Prix in the middle of the season over

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
summer.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.080
Thanks to this, the European leg of the season is, compared to the rest, relatively easy

01:50.080 --> 01:53.280
logistically because within Europe, you can drive.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.840
The cost of shipping by truck is so comparatively low to shipping by plane that teams bring

01:57.840 --> 02:00.820
whole buildings with them to European races.

02:00.820 --> 02:05.020
These buildings are what are modestly referred to as motorhomes but can be as large as Red

02:05.020 --> 02:09.480
Bull's three-story structure that includes offices, bars, and a restaurant with a complete

02:09.480 --> 02:10.480
kitchen.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.520
All of that packs into a number of trucks and can be assembled in less than two days.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.960
Along with all the other equipment including cars, spare parts, and electronics, convoys

02:19.960 --> 02:25.120
of dozens of trucks per team crisscross the continent before each European race.

02:25.120 --> 02:28.640
Typically races are held every two weekends on Sunday which gives teams plenty of time

02:28.640 --> 02:32.760
to relocate before activity begins on the Thursday before the Grand Prix but from time

02:32.760 --> 02:37.000
to time the schedule is crunched and races take place two weekends in a row.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.340
This proves a more daunting logistical challenge as teams only have three full days to break

02:41.340 --> 02:45.980
down, transport, and reassemble their equipment at the new race site.

02:45.980 --> 02:51.180
Even worse, for the first time ever the 2018 season saw three weekends with three races

02:51.180 --> 02:52.180
in a row.

02:52.180 --> 02:56.200
On June 24th, the French Grand Prix took place in Le Castellette and the next weekend the

02:56.200 --> 02:59.800
Austrian one was held in Spielberg finishing off the following weekend with the British

02:59.800 --> 03:01.600
Grand Prix in Silverstone.

03:01.600 --> 03:07.080
The Austria-UK transfer was the most difficult one as it involved driving nearly 1,000 miles

03:07.080 --> 03:09.920
including through the choke point of the Channel Tunnel.

03:09.920 --> 03:14.140
For this trek, each truck was manned by three drivers so that while one drove, the others

03:14.140 --> 03:17.000
could sleep in an RV that accompanied the convoy.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.120
That way, the trucks could drive continuously only stopping to refuel.

03:21.120 --> 03:26.220
But again, these races are easy logistically compared to the ones outside of Europe—the

03:26.220 --> 03:28.800
ones known as fly-away races.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.720
Just like with the European races, a majority of fly-away races occur with two weeks between

03:32.720 --> 03:37.500
them but from time to time races are scheduled on back-to-back weekends thousands of miles

03:37.500 --> 03:38.520
apart.

03:38.520 --> 03:43.320
These back-to-back fly-away races are the most logistically difficult weeks of the Formula

03:43.360 --> 03:44.440
season.

03:44.440 --> 03:49.200
On Sunday, April 8th, 2018, the Bahrain Grand Prix was held in Sakhir, Bahrain then seven

03:49.200 --> 03:53.840
days later, the following weekend, the Chinese Grand Prix was held in Shanghai, China.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.980
Over 4,000 miles separated those two racetracks and yet, just like with every race, everything

03:58.980 --> 04:04.640
came down on Sunday night in Bahrain and had to be operational by Thursday morning in China.

04:04.640 --> 04:09.480
Even worse, Shanghai is five hours ahead of Bahrain which is effectively five hours fewer

04:09.480 --> 04:14.960
to do the work but in reality, the planning for this transfer began months before.

04:14.960 --> 04:19.080
Around January 2018, three months before the first races of the season, each of the ten

04:19.080 --> 04:22.260
teams packed up five sets of shipping containers.

04:22.260 --> 04:27.060
Each of these sets held their sea kits carrying things like chairs, tables, appliances, cooking

04:27.060 --> 04:29.840
utensils, and some elements of their garages.

04:29.840 --> 04:34.080
They send these bulkier and less expensive pieces of equipment by sea as it's massively

04:34.080 --> 04:36.740
less expensive than sending them by plane.

04:36.740 --> 04:40.100
The number of containers per team varies as the wealthier teams like Red Bull will

04:40.100 --> 04:44.740
take more but in general each team takes about three 40-foot containers.

04:44.740 --> 04:48.960
Of course ocean shipping is slower, but since there are five sets there is always one at

04:48.960 --> 04:51.420
the right place at the right time.

04:51.420 --> 04:55.820
That January shipment sent the first five kits to the first five fly-away races—Melbourne

04:55.820 --> 05:01.700
Australia, Sakhir Bahrain, Shanghai, China, Baku, Azerbaijan, and Montreal, Canada.

05:01.700 --> 05:05.640
Then as each race was completed its kit was packed up and sent to the next fly-away race

05:05.640 --> 05:07.440
destination without a kit.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.440
The Australian one went to Singapore, the Bahrainian one to Russia, the Chinese one

05:11.440 --> 05:16.200
to Japan, the Azerbaijani one to the United States, and the Canadian one to Mexico.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.480
And then towards the end of the season, when there are no more tracks to send kits to,

05:19.480 --> 05:22.400
they're sent back to the team's home bases for the winter.

05:22.400 --> 05:26.340
At the race track, the Formula One logistics team's main downtime is actually during

05:26.340 --> 05:31.200
the race itself but for the Bahrain to China transfer real work began the Thursday before

05:31.200 --> 05:32.200
the race.

05:32.200 --> 05:36.300
That's when each team's logistics manager started making their tear-down plan—deciding

05:36.300 --> 05:40.460
in which order and into which containers their different pieces of equipment should go.

05:40.460 --> 05:44.520
Once that was completed, there really was not a lot to do until Sunday.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.580
On Sunday morning, before the race even started, the pack-up began.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.620
Many of the spare parts can't be used during the race—they're not going to replace

05:51.620 --> 05:55.540
an engine during the Grand Prix—so they're the first pieces of kit to be packed into

05:55.540 --> 05:56.540
their containers.

05:56.540 --> 06:01.180
Not much happened during the race itself but within 15 minutes of it ending, the main pack-up

06:01.180 --> 06:02.180
began.

06:02.180 --> 06:06.420
The cars, the most important pieces of equipment, were subjected to a post-race inspection to

06:06.420 --> 06:10.780
be sure no illegal modifications were made but everything else was immediately ready

06:10.780 --> 06:11.780
for packing.

06:11.780 --> 06:15.520
All the equipment that the teams wanted at the destination first were put into one of

06:15.520 --> 06:17.540
three priority pallets.

06:17.540 --> 06:21.820
Together, each team's priority pallets filled up the first plane to Shanghai.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.820
As soon as these were packed, they were driven directly to the airport only a few hours after

06:25.820 --> 06:29.420
the race ended to be prepared for the early morning flight to Shanghai.

06:29.420 --> 06:33.680
As that plane took off, the final pallets were being packed up back at the race track.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.960
Only about six to eight hours after the drop of the checkered flag, all pallets were packed

06:37.960 --> 06:40.280
up and on their way to the airport.

06:40.280 --> 06:45.060
By midday Monday, all six of the Boeing 747s used to transport the team's equipment to

06:45.060 --> 06:46.820
China were in the air.

06:46.820 --> 06:51.340
These planes were chartered by Formula One but the teams still pay for the space.

06:51.340 --> 06:54.960
Also on Monday, all the staff started their journey to Shanghai.

06:54.960 --> 06:58.900
Many of the lower-level staff just flew on normal commercial flights while some of the

06:58.900 --> 07:02.800
higher profile drivers flew private between the two countries.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.960
After nine hours in the air, the first plane touched down in Shanghai around early evening

07:06.960 --> 07:08.100
local time.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.560
The freight was unloaded and brought to customs.

07:10.560 --> 07:14.460
By midnight, all the priority freight was on its way to the race track.

07:14.460 --> 07:18.340
Overnight, logistics workers arranged the different team's freight into their respective

07:18.340 --> 07:19.340
paddocks.

07:19.340 --> 07:22.860
No team is allowed to touch their freight until all the other team's freight has arrived

07:22.860 --> 07:27.060
both for fairness purposes and safety to assure that there aren't many people around as

07:27.060 --> 07:29.340
pallets are being unloaded and moved.

07:29.340 --> 07:32.520
By Tuesday morning, it's game on for the assembly crews.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.460
At this point each team had their three priority pallets and their sea kit.

07:36.460 --> 07:40.580
In their priority pallets, teams didn't put the highest value or most important cargo,

07:40.580 --> 07:45.020
they put the things they needed to assemble first—the bare bones of their garage.

07:45.020 --> 07:48.640
That includes the wall paneling, the core of their electrical system, and the majority

07:48.640 --> 07:51.000
of the IT and communications equipment.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.740
By Tuesday evening that build was done and the track was once again made inaccessible

07:54.740 --> 07:58.580
to the teams as the non-priority pallets were delivered overnight.

07:58.580 --> 08:02.820
Early Wednesday morning around 6 AM the teams arrived back at the track and began work on

08:02.820 --> 08:05.020
the final assembly of the garage.

08:05.020 --> 08:09.860
Only after about four hours, by late morning, all the different team's garages were operational.

08:09.860 --> 08:15.020
All in all, ten Formula One teams successfully packed up, shipped all their equipment 4,000

08:15.020 --> 08:19.380
miles, and reassembled their paddocks in 58 hours.

08:19.380 --> 08:24.220
Thanks to careful planning and practiced workers, Formula One pulls off this impressive feat

08:24.220 --> 08:26.980
every year without a hitch.

08:26.980 --> 08:30.960
Earlier in the video I mentioned how the short seven-day Spielberg Austria to Silverstone

08:30.960 --> 08:35.660
UK transfer is the hardest race transfer in Europe but interestingly, about a month ago

08:35.660 --> 08:40.420
Ubisoft brought me out to the Spielberg Formula One track to try out their new racing game,

08:40.420 --> 08:41.460
The Crew 2.

08:41.460 --> 08:46.260
The game is open world meaning that they actually recreated the entire US and you can drive

08:46.260 --> 08:51.720
and race through all of it not only in cars but also motorcycles, boats, and planes.

08:51.720 --> 08:56.160
Even as someone who doesn't play video games much, I enjoyed The Crew 2 a lot and it seemed

08:56.160 --> 09:00.880
an accurate recreation of the actual racing I did that day on the Spielberg track.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.600
If you think you might be interested in playing this, there will be a link in the description

09:04.600 --> 09:06.440
where you can check it out.

09:06.440 --> 09:10.840
Thanks to the support of The Crew 2 and Ubisoft, this video is an extra one so there will be

09:10.840 --> 09:13.360
another Wendover video out next week.
