00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
This video was made possible by The Crew 2, a new open-world racing game from Ubisoft.

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:08,200
More about it after the video.

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,880
No sport is as logistically challenging as motorsports.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,080
While equipment matters in any sport, in motorsport the human is only half the athlete.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,080
The vehicle is the other half.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,520
The performance of a motorsports vehicle is directly tied to having the right components

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,260
in the right place at the right time so the logistics are part of the competition.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,700
Racing may be a sport, but it's not all fun and games.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,860
Teams are businesses—businesses that are expected to make money.

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,180
The most valuable Formula One team, Scuderia Ferrari, is worth over $1.3 billion.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,880
This means this team is valued at about as much as tech companies Discord, Bird Rides,

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
or DoorDash.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,840
The wealthier teams, like Ferrari, are able to spend more money on transport to bring

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
more equipment and spare parts which can make the difference between winning and losing

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,300
when things go wrong.

16
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,940
Formula One is by many measures the most international sports competition.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:07,220
Over its 21 yearly races the teams traverse five continents with as little as a week between

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,220
events.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,160
A chaotic ballet of trucks, boats, and planes transports this show across the world each

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
year.

21
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,980
Ten teams compete in Formula One and despite it taking place worldwide it is by all measures

22
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,420
a European sport.

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,160
Eight of the ten teams are registered in and operate out of Europe.

24
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,360
Only the Indian and American teams are from elsewhere although the Indian team is actually

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,460
based in the UK while the US team, based in North Carolina, operates a secondary forward

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,400
base in the UK so that its staff doesn't have to travel all the way back to the US

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,300
between each of the European races which in recent years have been held consecutively

28
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,240
with the brief interruption of the Canadian Grand Prix in the middle of the season over

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
summer.

30
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,080
Thanks to this, the European leg of the season is, compared to the rest, relatively easy

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,280
logistically because within Europe, you can drive.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,840
The cost of shipping by truck is so comparatively low to shipping by plane that teams bring

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,820
whole buildings with them to European races.

34
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,020
These buildings are what are modestly referred to as motorhomes but can be as large as Red

35
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,480
Bull's three-story structure that includes offices, bars, and a restaurant with a complete

36
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,480
kitchen.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,520
All of that packs into a number of trucks and can be assembled in less than two days.

38
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,960
Along with all the other equipment including cars, spare parts, and electronics, convoys

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,120
of dozens of trucks per team crisscross the continent before each European race.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640
Typically races are held every two weekends on Sunday which gives teams plenty of time

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,760
to relocate before activity begins on the Thursday before the Grand Prix but from time

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,000
to time the schedule is crunched and races take place two weekends in a row.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,340
This proves a more daunting logistical challenge as teams only have three full days to break

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,980
down, transport, and reassemble their equipment at the new race site.

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:51,180
Even worse, for the first time ever the 2018 season saw three weekends with three races

46
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,180
in a row.

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,200
On June 24th, the French Grand Prix took place in Le Castellette and the next weekend the

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Austrian one was held in Spielberg finishing off the following weekend with the British

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,600
Grand Prix in Silverstone.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,080
The Austria-UK transfer was the most difficult one as it involved driving nearly 1,000 miles

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,920
including through the choke point of the Channel Tunnel.

52
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,140
For this trek, each truck was manned by three drivers so that while one drove, the others

53
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,000
could sleep in an RV that accompanied the convoy.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,120
That way, the trucks could drive continuously only stopping to refuel.

55
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,220
But again, these races are easy logistically compared to the ones outside of Europe—the

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,800
ones known as fly-away races.

57
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,720
Just like with the European races, a majority of fly-away races occur with two weeks between

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,500
them but from time to time races are scheduled on back-to-back weekends thousands of miles

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,520
apart.

60
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,320
These back-to-back fly-away races are the most logistically difficult weeks of the Formula

61
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,440
season.

62
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,200
On Sunday, April 8th, 2018, the Bahrain Grand Prix was held in Sakhir, Bahrain then seven

63
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,840
days later, the following weekend, the Chinese Grand Prix was held in Shanghai, China.

64
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,980
Over 4,000 miles separated those two racetracks and yet, just like with every race, everything

65
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:04,640
came down on Sunday night in Bahrain and had to be operational by Thursday morning in China.

66
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,480
Even worse, Shanghai is five hours ahead of Bahrain which is effectively five hours fewer

67
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,960
to do the work but in reality, the planning for this transfer began months before.

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,080
Around January 2018, three months before the first races of the season, each of the ten

69
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,260
teams packed up five sets of shipping containers.

70
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,060
Each of these sets held their sea kits carrying things like chairs, tables, appliances, cooking

71
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,840
utensils, and some elements of their garages.

72
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,080
They send these bulkier and less expensive pieces of equipment by sea as it's massively

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,740
less expensive than sending them by plane.

74
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,100
The number of containers per team varies as the wealthier teams like Red Bull will

75
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,740
take more but in general each team takes about three 40-foot containers.

76
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,960
Of course ocean shipping is slower, but since there are five sets there is always one at

77
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,420
the right place at the right time.

78
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,820
That January shipment sent the first five kits to the first five fly-away races—Melbourne

79
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,700
Australia, Sakhir Bahrain, Shanghai, China, Baku, Azerbaijan, and Montreal, Canada.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,640
Then as each race was completed its kit was packed up and sent to the next fly-away race

81
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
destination without a kit.

82
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
The Australian one went to Singapore, the Bahrainian one to Russia, the Chinese one

83
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,200
to Japan, the Azerbaijani one to the United States, and the Canadian one to Mexico.

84
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,480
And then towards the end of the season, when there are no more tracks to send kits to,

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,400
they're sent back to the team's home bases for the winter.

86
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,340
At the race track, the Formula One logistics team's main downtime is actually during

87
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,200
the race itself but for the Bahrain to China transfer real work began the Thursday before

88
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
the race.

89
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,300
That's when each team's logistics manager started making their tear-down plan—deciding

90
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,460
in which order and into which containers their different pieces of equipment should go.

91
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,520
Once that was completed, there really was not a lot to do until Sunday.

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,580
On Sunday morning, before the race even started, the pack-up began.

93
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,620
Many of the spare parts can't be used during the race—they're not going to replace

94
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,540
an engine during the Grand Prix—so they're the first pieces of kit to be packed into

95
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
their containers.

96
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,180
Not much happened during the race itself but within 15 minutes of it ending, the main pack-up

97
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,180
began.

98
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,420
The cars, the most important pieces of equipment, were subjected to a post-race inspection to

99
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,780
be sure no illegal modifications were made but everything else was immediately ready

100
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
for packing.

101
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,520
All the equipment that the teams wanted at the destination first were put into one of

102
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,540
three priority pallets.

103
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,820
Together, each team's priority pallets filled up the first plane to Shanghai.

104
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,820
As soon as these were packed, they were driven directly to the airport only a few hours after

105
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,420
the race ended to be prepared for the early morning flight to Shanghai.

106
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,680
As that plane took off, the final pallets were being packed up back at the race track.

107
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,960
Only about six to eight hours after the drop of the checkered flag, all pallets were packed

108
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,280
up and on their way to the airport.

109
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,060
By midday Monday, all six of the Boeing 747s used to transport the team's equipment to

110
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,820
China were in the air.

111
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,340
These planes were chartered by Formula One but the teams still pay for the space.

112
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,960
Also on Monday, all the staff started their journey to Shanghai.

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,900
Many of the lower-level staff just flew on normal commercial flights while some of the

114
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,800
higher profile drivers flew private between the two countries.

115
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,960
After nine hours in the air, the first plane touched down in Shanghai around early evening

116
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,100
local time.

117
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,560
The freight was unloaded and brought to customs.

118
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,460
By midnight, all the priority freight was on its way to the race track.

119
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,340
Overnight, logistics workers arranged the different team's freight into their respective

120
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,340
paddocks.

121
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,860
No team is allowed to touch their freight until all the other team's freight has arrived

122
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,060
both for fairness purposes and safety to assure that there aren't many people around as

123
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,340
pallets are being unloaded and moved.

124
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,520
By Tuesday morning, it's game on for the assembly crews.

125
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,460
At this point each team had their three priority pallets and their sea kit.

126
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,580
In their priority pallets, teams didn't put the highest value or most important cargo,

127
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,020
they put the things they needed to assemble first—the bare bones of their garage.

128
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,640
That includes the wall paneling, the core of their electrical system, and the majority

129
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,000
of the IT and communications equipment.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,740
By Tuesday evening that build was done and the track was once again made inaccessible

131
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,580
to the teams as the non-priority pallets were delivered overnight.

132
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,820
Early Wednesday morning around 6 AM the teams arrived back at the track and began work on

133
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,020
the final assembly of the garage.

134
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,860
Only after about four hours, by late morning, all the different team's garages were operational.

135
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,020
All in all, ten Formula One teams successfully packed up, shipped all their equipment 4,000

136
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,380
miles, and reassembled their paddocks in 58 hours.

137
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,220
Thanks to careful planning and practiced workers, Formula One pulls off this impressive feat

138
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,980
every year without a hitch.

139
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,960
Earlier in the video I mentioned how the short seven-day Spielberg Austria to Silverstone

140
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,660
UK transfer is the hardest race transfer in Europe but interestingly, about a month ago

141
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,420
Ubisoft brought me out to the Spielberg Formula One track to try out their new racing game,

142
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,460
The Crew 2.

143
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,260
The game is open world meaning that they actually recreated the entire US and you can drive

144
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,720
and race through all of it not only in cars but also motorcycles, boats, and planes.

145
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,160
Even as someone who doesn't play video games much, I enjoyed The Crew 2 a lot and it seemed

146
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
an accurate recreation of the actual racing I did that day on the Spielberg track.

147
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,600
If you think you might be interested in playing this, there will be a link in the description

148
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,440
where you can check it out.

149
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Thanks to the support of The Crew 2 and Ubisoft, this video is an extra one so there will be

150
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,360
another Wendover video out next week.
