00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
Nearly everything we buy is made overseas.

00:08.400 --> 00:12.340
No matter where you live, it's likely that the majority of products you use on a daily

00:12.340 --> 00:16.480
basis are made outside your own country's borders.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.920
Even at the supermarket, it's common to see fresh food that was grown or caught on

00:20.920 --> 00:22.940
the other side of the world.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.980
Not long ago, this would have been unheard of.

00:25.980 --> 00:28.360
Everything had to be produced close to the consumer.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.520
It just wasn't profitable to ship goods over long distances.

00:32.520 --> 00:36.600
Only luxury and specialty items were shipped from overseas.

00:36.600 --> 00:40.000
Very few common place items were produced more than a couple hundred miles away from

00:40.000 --> 00:41.580
the final market.

00:41.580 --> 00:47.980
That all changed on April 26, 1956 when the Ideal-X, a converted World War II tanker,

00:47.980 --> 00:50.640
left Newark, New Jersey on its main journey.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.840
What was so special about this journey was that it was the first time in history that

00:54.840 --> 00:59.560
a ship had its cargo packed into containers rather than just loosely placed throughout

00:59.560 --> 01:00.880
its holds.

01:00.880 --> 01:07.200
This seems like a simple and uninfluential concept, but this idea changed our world.

01:07.200 --> 01:13.880
Before the Ideal-X, cargo was brought to port in trucks and loaded onto ships piece by piece.

01:13.880 --> 01:18.880
Whiskey and rice and hammers and everything was packed tightly into the hold and the whole

01:18.880 --> 01:22.320
loading process took more than a week.

01:22.320 --> 01:27.920
This technique, known as break bulk cargo, dated back to the time of the Phoenicians.

01:27.920 --> 01:33.200
It was said that dock workers wages were $20 a day and all the scotch you could carry home

01:33.200 --> 01:36.660
because theft of goods was so rampant.

01:36.660 --> 01:38.520
This needed to change.

01:38.520 --> 01:43.440
Malcolm McLean, a trucking company owner, sold everything he owned to buy a ship and

01:43.440 --> 01:46.600
develop the system of containerization.

01:46.600 --> 01:52.160
Unbearably simple, he designed a corrugated steel box and created some trucks and a ship

01:52.160 --> 01:54.880
that would seamlessly hold these boxes.

01:54.880 --> 01:59.880
This connected the manufacturer straight to the consumer.

01:59.880 --> 02:04.040
Manufacturers would load these boxes, then no hands would touch the merchandise until

02:04.040 --> 02:08.920
the container was delivered to the vendor, distributor, or consumer.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.520
One of the most amazing aspects of this system is that it became universal.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.000
We can't even agree on a currency, plug type, DVD standard, or even which side of

02:18.000 --> 02:24.780
the road to drive on, but we can agree, across the world, on the one size of shipping container.

02:24.780 --> 02:29.880
A container loaded in Kansas will fit on the train that takes it to the dock, then fit

02:29.880 --> 02:35.680
on the boat that takes it to China, then fit on the truck that will take it up to Russia.

02:35.680 --> 02:39.440
Even some planes are now being designed to fit intermodal containers.

02:39.440 --> 02:45.120
There's no need for logistics, no need for calculations, no need for worrying if the

02:45.120 --> 02:48.200
container will work in far away countries.

02:48.200 --> 02:52.420
But what really changed our world was how quick this system made the loading process

02:52.420 --> 02:53.800
of a ship.

02:53.800 --> 02:58.760
What used to take more than a week, could now be done in a matter of hours.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.520
Shipping costs plummeted after the introduction of this system.

03:02.520 --> 03:07.280
Whole cities such as Newark and Oakland were put on the map because of their new, larger

03:07.280 --> 03:11.460
ports that were needed in response to the shipping boom.

03:11.460 --> 03:16.300
This system also helped create the global economy that we have today, one where one

03:16.300 --> 03:20.300
car has elements from dozens of countries across the world.

03:20.300 --> 03:25.340
It's now cheaper to manufacture many goods on the other side of the world because shipping

03:25.340 --> 03:27.580
is so inexpensive.

03:27.580 --> 03:32.780
Containerization was the greatest driver of the development of a global economy and trade

03:32.780 --> 03:33.780
network.

03:33.780 --> 03:39.540
The intermodal container cut shipping time from Europe to Australia down from 70 to 34

03:39.540 --> 03:43.260
days without increasing the speed of travel.

03:43.260 --> 03:47.700
We are still witnessing the aftermath of this innovation today.

03:47.700 --> 03:54.340
Between 1993 and 2002, the average distance of a cargo shipment grew by 40%.

03:54.340 --> 03:59.720
This means that goods are still being manufactured farther and farther away from their market.

03:59.720 --> 04:03.100
The value per ton of cargo is also dropping.

04:03.100 --> 04:07.500
More and more cheap items are being shipped from far away to be sold.

04:07.500 --> 04:12.180
However, many believe that containerization could have been the last great innovation

04:12.180 --> 04:13.700
in shipping.

04:13.700 --> 04:17.300
Boats can't really go any faster while still being profitable.

04:17.300 --> 04:22.380
50 knots is the average speed today for cargo ships and it's unlikely that this speed

04:22.380 --> 04:25.420
will increase in the near future.

04:25.420 --> 04:30.900
To make shipping faster and cheaper, one needs to find other ways to speed up the process.

04:30.900 --> 04:35.300
There are some small changes being developed such as the automization of ports and further

04:35.300 --> 04:40.260
specialization of ships, however the greatest innovation for shipping may come from the

04:40.260 --> 04:42.780
greatest threat to mankind.

04:42.780 --> 04:45.800
Global warming is opening new routes for shipping.

04:45.800 --> 04:51.020
The once frozen northeast passage north of Scandinavia and Russia now can be sailed on

04:51.020 --> 04:53.020
for a few months of the year.

04:53.020 --> 04:59.140
In 2009, a German cargo ship became the first commercial vessel to sail this route and today

04:59.140 --> 05:01.900
multiple ships use this route every year.

05:01.900 --> 05:06.780
The route shortens the shipping time between Europe and Asia by days, avoids the pirate

05:06.780 --> 05:12.820
infested waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and saves on average $300,000 in fuel

05:12.820 --> 05:16.140
per vessel per voyage.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.140
So there you have it.

05:17.140 --> 05:20.420
That's how a metal box changed our world.

05:20.420 --> 05:24.960
Without that box, we wouldn't have our phones from China, our clothes from Bangladesh, or

05:24.960 --> 05:27.260
even our oranges from Florida.

05:27.260 --> 05:31.880
Shipping is a behind the scenes process that has made our world what it is today.

05:31.880 --> 05:36.640
Our economy and our lives would not be the same without this innovation.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.600
Containerization may be little known, but its effects are more evident than almost any

05:40.600 --> 05:42.600
other invention of the 20th century.

06:01.880 --> 06:06.280
Thank you.
