0	8400	Nearly everything we buy is made overseas.
8400	12340	No matter where you live, it's likely that the majority of products you use on a daily
12340	16480	basis are made outside your own country's borders.
16480	20920	Even at the supermarket, it's common to see fresh food that was grown or caught on
20920	22940	the other side of the world.
22940	25980	Not long ago, this would have been unheard of.
25980	28360	Everything had to be produced close to the consumer.
28360	32520	It just wasn't profitable to ship goods over long distances.
32520	36600	Only luxury and specialty items were shipped from overseas.
36600	40000	Very few common place items were produced more than a couple hundred miles away from
40000	41580	the final market.
41580	47980	That all changed on April 26, 1956 when the Ideal-X, a converted World War II tanker,
47980	50640	left Newark, New Jersey on its main journey.
50640	54840	What was so special about this journey was that it was the first time in history that
54840	59560	a ship had its cargo packed into containers rather than just loosely placed throughout
59560	60880	its holds.
60880	67200	This seems like a simple and uninfluential concept, but this idea changed our world.
67200	73880	Before the Ideal-X, cargo was brought to port in trucks and loaded onto ships piece by piece.
73880	78880	Whiskey and rice and hammers and everything was packed tightly into the hold and the whole
78880	82320	loading process took more than a week.
82320	87920	This technique, known as break bulk cargo, dated back to the time of the Phoenicians.
87920	93200	It was said that dock workers wages were $20 a day and all the scotch you could carry home
93200	96660	because theft of goods was so rampant.
96660	98520	This needed to change.
98520	103440	Malcolm McLean, a trucking company owner, sold everything he owned to buy a ship and
103440	106600	develop the system of containerization.
106600	112160	Unbearably simple, he designed a corrugated steel box and created some trucks and a ship
112160	114880	that would seamlessly hold these boxes.
114880	119880	This connected the manufacturer straight to the consumer.
119880	124040	Manufacturers would load these boxes, then no hands would touch the merchandise until
124040	128920	the container was delivered to the vendor, distributor, or consumer.
128920	133520	One of the most amazing aspects of this system is that it became universal.
133520	138000	We can't even agree on a currency, plug type, DVD standard, or even which side of
138000	144780	the road to drive on, but we can agree, across the world, on the one size of shipping container.
144780	149880	A container loaded in Kansas will fit on the train that takes it to the dock, then fit
149880	155680	on the boat that takes it to China, then fit on the truck that will take it up to Russia.
155680	159440	Even some planes are now being designed to fit intermodal containers.
159440	165120	There's no need for logistics, no need for calculations, no need for worrying if the
165120	168200	container will work in far away countries.
168200	172420	But what really changed our world was how quick this system made the loading process
172420	173800	of a ship.
173800	178760	What used to take more than a week, could now be done in a matter of hours.
178760	182520	Shipping costs plummeted after the introduction of this system.
182520	187280	Whole cities such as Newark and Oakland were put on the map because of their new, larger
187280	191460	ports that were needed in response to the shipping boom.
191460	196300	This system also helped create the global economy that we have today, one where one
196300	200300	car has elements from dozens of countries across the world.
200300	205340	It's now cheaper to manufacture many goods on the other side of the world because shipping
205340	207580	is so inexpensive.
207580	212780	Containerization was the greatest driver of the development of a global economy and trade
212780	213780	network.
213780	219540	The intermodal container cut shipping time from Europe to Australia down from 70 to 34
219540	223260	days without increasing the speed of travel.
223260	227700	We are still witnessing the aftermath of this innovation today.
227700	234340	Between 1993 and 2002, the average distance of a cargo shipment grew by 40%.
234340	239720	This means that goods are still being manufactured farther and farther away from their market.
239720	243100	The value per ton of cargo is also dropping.
243100	247500	More and more cheap items are being shipped from far away to be sold.
247500	252180	However, many believe that containerization could have been the last great innovation
252180	253700	in shipping.
253700	257300	Boats can't really go any faster while still being profitable.
257300	262380	50 knots is the average speed today for cargo ships and it's unlikely that this speed
262380	265420	will increase in the near future.
265420	270900	To make shipping faster and cheaper, one needs to find other ways to speed up the process.
270900	275300	There are some small changes being developed such as the automization of ports and further
275300	280260	specialization of ships, however the greatest innovation for shipping may come from the
280260	282780	greatest threat to mankind.
282780	285800	Global warming is opening new routes for shipping.
285800	291020	The once frozen northeast passage north of Scandinavia and Russia now can be sailed on
291020	293020	for a few months of the year.
293020	299140	In 2009, a German cargo ship became the first commercial vessel to sail this route and today
299140	301900	multiple ships use this route every year.
301900	306780	The route shortens the shipping time between Europe and Asia by days, avoids the pirate
306780	312820	infested waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and saves on average $300,000 in fuel
312820	316140	per vessel per voyage.
316140	317140	So there you have it.
317140	320420	That's how a metal box changed our world.
320420	324960	Without that box, we wouldn't have our phones from China, our clothes from Bangladesh, or
324960	327260	even our oranges from Florida.
327260	331880	Shipping is a behind the scenes process that has made our world what it is today.
331880	336640	Our economy and our lives would not be the same without this innovation.
336640	340600	Containerization may be little known, but its effects are more evident than almost any
340600	342600	other invention of the 20th century.
361880	366280	Thank you.
