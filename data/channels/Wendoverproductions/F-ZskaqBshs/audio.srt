1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
Nearly everything we buy is made overseas.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,340
No matter where you live, it's likely that the majority of products you use on a daily

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,480
basis are made outside your own country's borders.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,920
Even at the supermarket, it's common to see fresh food that was grown or caught on

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,940
the other side of the world.

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,980
Not long ago, this would have been unheard of.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,360
Everything had to be produced close to the consumer.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,520
It just wasn't profitable to ship goods over long distances.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
Only luxury and specialty items were shipped from overseas.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,000
Very few common place items were produced more than a couple hundred miles away from

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,580
the final market.

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:47,980
That all changed on April 26, 1956 when the Ideal-X, a converted World War II tanker,

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,640
left Newark, New Jersey on its main journey.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,840
What was so special about this journey was that it was the first time in history that

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,560
a ship had its cargo packed into containers rather than just loosely placed throughout

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,880
its holds.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,200
This seems like a simple and uninfluential concept, but this idea changed our world.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,880
Before the Ideal-X, cargo was brought to port in trucks and loaded onto ships piece by piece.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,880
Whiskey and rice and hammers and everything was packed tightly into the hold and the whole

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
loading process took more than a week.

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
This technique, known as break bulk cargo, dated back to the time of the Phoenicians.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,200
It was said that dock workers wages were $20 a day and all the scotch you could carry home

23
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,660
because theft of goods was so rampant.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,520
This needed to change.

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,440
Malcolm McLean, a trucking company owner, sold everything he owned to buy a ship and

26
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,600
develop the system of containerization.

27
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:52,160
Unbearably simple, he designed a corrugated steel box and created some trucks and a ship

28
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,880
that would seamlessly hold these boxes.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,880
This connected the manufacturer straight to the consumer.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,040
Manufacturers would load these boxes, then no hands would touch the merchandise until

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,920
the container was delivered to the vendor, distributor, or consumer.

32
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,520
One of the most amazing aspects of this system is that it became universal.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
We can't even agree on a currency, plug type, DVD standard, or even which side of

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,780
the road to drive on, but we can agree, across the world, on the one size of shipping container.

35
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,880
A container loaded in Kansas will fit on the train that takes it to the dock, then fit

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,680
on the boat that takes it to China, then fit on the truck that will take it up to Russia.

37
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
Even some planes are now being designed to fit intermodal containers.

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,120
There's no need for logistics, no need for calculations, no need for worrying if the

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,200
container will work in far away countries.

40
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,420
But what really changed our world was how quick this system made the loading process

41
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,800
of a ship.

42
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,760
What used to take more than a week, could now be done in a matter of hours.

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,520
Shipping costs plummeted after the introduction of this system.

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,280
Whole cities such as Newark and Oakland were put on the map because of their new, larger

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,460
ports that were needed in response to the shipping boom.

46
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,300
This system also helped create the global economy that we have today, one where one

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,300
car has elements from dozens of countries across the world.

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:25,340
It's now cheaper to manufacture many goods on the other side of the world because shipping

49
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,580
is so inexpensive.

50
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,780
Containerization was the greatest driver of the development of a global economy and trade

51
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
network.

52
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,540
The intermodal container cut shipping time from Europe to Australia down from 70 to 34

53
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,260
days without increasing the speed of travel.

54
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,700
We are still witnessing the aftermath of this innovation today.

55
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,340
Between 1993 and 2002, the average distance of a cargo shipment grew by 40%.

56
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,720
This means that goods are still being manufactured farther and farther away from their market.

57
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,100
The value per ton of cargo is also dropping.

58
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:07,500
More and more cheap items are being shipped from far away to be sold.

59
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,180
However, many believe that containerization could have been the last great innovation

60
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,700
in shipping.

61
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,300
Boats can't really go any faster while still being profitable.

62
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,380
50 knots is the average speed today for cargo ships and it's unlikely that this speed

63
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,420
will increase in the near future.

64
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,900
To make shipping faster and cheaper, one needs to find other ways to speed up the process.

65
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,300
There are some small changes being developed such as the automization of ports and further

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,260
specialization of ships, however the greatest innovation for shipping may come from the

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,780
greatest threat to mankind.

68
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,800
Global warming is opening new routes for shipping.

69
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,020
The once frozen northeast passage north of Scandinavia and Russia now can be sailed on

70
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,020
for a few months of the year.

71
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:59,140
In 2009, a German cargo ship became the first commercial vessel to sail this route and today

72
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,900
multiple ships use this route every year.

73
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,780
The route shortens the shipping time between Europe and Asia by days, avoids the pirate

74
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,820
infested waters of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and saves on average $300,000 in fuel

75
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,140
per vessel per voyage.

76
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,140
So there you have it.

77
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,420
That's how a metal box changed our world.

78
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,960
Without that box, we wouldn't have our phones from China, our clothes from Bangladesh, or

79
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,260
even our oranges from Florida.

80
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,880
Shipping is a behind the scenes process that has made our world what it is today.

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,640
Our economy and our lives would not be the same without this innovation.

82
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,600
Containerization may be little known, but its effects are more evident than almost any

83
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
other invention of the 20th century.

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,280
Thank you.
