7360	11180	Seventeen years ago, an aviation frontier was broken.
11180	16780	Just before noon on March 1st, 2001, a Continental Airlines 777 lifted off from frosty Newark
16780	19480	airport across the river from New York City.
19480	24080	It tracked north over the US, then Canada, and then just kept flying north until north
24080	25080	became south.
25080	29480	It flew south over Russia, then Mongolia, then mainland China before setting down at
29480	33420	Chek Lap Kok airport in Hong Kong after 16 hours.
33420	36240	With that, there was a new longest flight in the world.
36240	40480	The two cities had never before been connected by non-stop commercial flights.
40480	43440	This was, at the time, a momentous achievement.
43440	47160	All the business travelers making frequent trips between the two financial centers badly
47160	51680	wanted this quicker flight, but you may be surprised that such a flight was an achievement
51680	53000	so recently.
53000	57580	Nowadays, non-stop Newark to Hong Kong flights are far from exceptional.
57740	62540	Five planes carrying more than 1,000 passengers total fly non-stop daily between the two cities
62540	66740	and nowadays, this route doesn't even crack the list of the top 20 longest flights in
66740	67740	the world.
67740	71620	Especially in the past three years, there's been a noticeable and dramatic rise in the
71620	74140	number of ultra-long-haul flights.
74140	78460	Among the 10 longest non-stop flights, the one on this list that's existed the longest,
78460	83020	since 2009, is Delta's daily service from Johannesburg to Atlanta—the only flight
83020	85220	by an American airline to South Africa.
85220	89500	In 2016, United started non-stop flights between San Francisco and Singapore, ending
89500	93280	an era during which there were no non-stop connections between the two countries.
93280	97720	Just recently, in October 2018, Philippine Airlines began flying from Manila to New York
97720	99800	non-stop on their new A350.
99800	104460	In 2014, Qantas started flying non-stop in both directions from Sydney to Dallas—then
104460	106340	the longest flight in the world.
106340	110780	In early 2018, United added another connection to Down Under with their route from Houston
110780	111780	to Sydney.
111780	116580	Singapore Airlines added another US connection in November 2018 flying from Los Angeles and
116580	120780	Emirates has operated the longest non-stop A380 flight in the world from Dubai to Auckland
120780	122460	since 2016.
122460	126220	Qantas started the first and currently only non-stop connection between Australia and
126220	131060	Europe in March 2018 with their daily Dreamliner service from Perth to London and Qatar operates
131060	135420	what was until recently the longest non-stop flight from Doha all the way to Auckland.
135420	140300	Lastly, the longest flight in the world, confidently beating the runner up by over 500 miles, is
140300	144260	the newly launched daily Singapore Airlines flight between Singapore and Newark clocking
144260	150220	in at 9,534 miles and up to 19 hours of flight time depending on winds.
150220	154180	8 of the 10 flights on this list were launched in the past three years.
154180	158360	While it can be expected that as technology advances airplane range will get longer, there's
158360	162780	been a noticeable acceleration in the addition of non-stop routes between earth's furthest
162780	163840	city pairs.
163840	167020	Like any phenomenon, this has causes and effects.
167020	171060	One factor driving this surge in ultra-long-haul flights is the release of two new planes in
171060	174580	the past decade—the A350 and 787.
174580	177780	Six of the 10 longest routes are flown by one of these two planes.
177780	181780	Now, planes have existed before that could fly the routes these fly but they weren't
181780	183020	as economical.
183020	186460	Singapore Airlines previously flew the world's longest flight from Singapore to Newark from
186460	191540	2004 until 2014 on their A340 but its high fuel consumption forced them to cancel the
191540	194220	route as soon as oil prices ticked up.
194220	199820	To fly fewer passengers a shorter maximum distance, the A340 uses 35% more fuel than
199820	201020	the A350.
201020	204380	Economics is everything with the world's longest routes.
204380	208640	The truth is that flying a non-stop flight from Singapore to New York uses more fuel
208640	212500	than flying a stopping service from Singapore to Tokyo to New York.
212500	216700	Now, this might seem counter-intuitive since planes use far more fuel per minute taking
216700	221580	off than they do in cruise and flying non-stop requires one take-off instead of two but that's
221580	224720	appealing to consider that it uses fuel to carry fuel.
224720	230300	With a 777-200, for example, flying 800 nautical miles will use about 30.6 pounds of fuel per
230300	231300	mile.
231300	235060	That pounds per mile average decreases up until reaching a total flight distance of
235060	237300	about 3,000 nautical miles.
237300	242540	Beyond that, the pounds per mile figure increases up until 8,000 nautical miles where the aircraft
242540	246100	would burn 32.2 pounds of fuel per mile flown.
246100	250220	This is because eventually, the added fuel from flying the extra fuel needed to fly long
250220	253860	distance overtakes the extra fuel used to take off.
253860	258100	That means that, with this aircraft, which is used to fly the daily 8,000 mile Qatar
258100	262480	flight between Doha and Houston, it would be more efficient on a fuel consumption basis
262480	266920	to fly something like Doha to Paris, Paris to Halifax, and Halifax to Houston rather
266920	269120	than flying the whole trip in one go.
269120	273420	This is part of the reason why cargo airlines rarely fly ultra-long-haul routes.
273420	277060	While UPS has plenty enough cargo to support a non-stop flight between their Louisville
277060	280760	and Hong Kong hubs and the aircraft that could fly it in one go, they fly the route
280760	284140	with a stop in Anchorage partially for fuel saving reasons.
284140	287980	Of course, any time on the ground is time that an aircraft could be in the air making
287980	292380	money so that degrades the savings and that's part of why cargo airlines don't only fly
292380	294540	in 3,000 mile hops.
294540	299140	Time matters for cargo airlines but not nearly as much as it does for passenger airlines.
299140	302500	Passenger airlines have to deal with people which are far more sensitive to a few extra
302500	305100	hours of travel time than boxes.
305140	308520	Non-stop flights are typically more desirable especially to the business traveler which
308520	312820	is why airlines will price connecting itineraries typically higher than non-stop ones even on
312820	316880	short routes where the cost to the airline of operating a connecting itinerary is higher
316880	318780	than that of a non-stop flight.
318780	323160	With higher costs, airlines therefore need to justify operating non-stop flights instead
323160	324300	of stopping ones.
324300	328420	Singapore Airlines does operate another flight to New York via Frankfurt with a far larger
328420	332660	A380 but the non-stop flight is primarily operated to appeal to the business traveler
332660	334020	who can pay more.
334020	337660	Often, the routes with enough demand to support ultra-long-haul flights are the ones with
337660	341780	high business traffic between big wealthy cities like Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong,
341780	343160	London, and New York.
343160	347260	Even though Hawaii, for example, is one of the top vacation destinations in the world,
347260	350880	you just don't see many long-haul flights to it from places like London because leisure
350880	355180	travelers are more sensitive to price and they'd rather pay less to fly via Los Angeles
355180	357660	rather than on a non-stop from London for more.
357660	361860	For this reason, on the A350s Singapore Airlines uses to fly to Newark, they didn't even
361860	365620	bother including an economy class—the kind that leisure travelers tend to book.
365620	368400	They only have premium economy and business class.
368400	372400	With the lower weight from fewer bags, seats, and passengers, the plane can fly more efficiently
372400	376120	to the other side of the world and, from the airlines' perspective, they're not losing
376120	379940	out on much since, at the prices they would have to sell economy seats to be competitive,
379940	382660	they really wouldn't be making much money anyways.
382660	386420	The higher margins of premium classes give them a better shot of breaking even on this
386420	387420	flight.
387420	390580	Of course, the other factor contributing to the rise of these ultra-long-haul flights
390580	392520	is the low cost of fuel.
392520	397740	Jet fuel prices halved in 2015 and bottomed out at a cost of only 85 cents per gallon
397740	399840	in January 2016.
399840	403280	Since then prices have steadily risen leading some to question whether troubled times were
403280	407500	ahead for the industry, but prices again took a dive in October 2018.
407500	412380	Overall, over the past four years, prices are lower than ever and with that fuel represents
412380	416580	a smaller proportion of an airline's cost so it's proportionally cheaper to fly longer
416580	417580	distances.
417580	422420	This fluctuation in fuel cost has also contributed to the rise, and in some cases fall, of long-haul
422420	426220	budget airlines such as Norwegian Airlines, Wow Air, and Primera Air.
426220	430400	So, we've established the causes of this proliferation of ultra-long-haul flights but
430400	432340	what are its effects?
432340	436000	One of the busiest long-distance flows of passengers is from Europe to Australia and
436000	437760	New Zealand and vice versa.
437760	441620	As two areas with close cultural and business connections, plenty of people travel between
441620	445340	them despite it taking about 24 hours each way.
445340	449260	Over the turn of the century almost every major European airline flew to Australia via
449260	454700	some stopping point like Bangkok, Singapore, or Hong Kong including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa,
454700	458560	Alitalia, and British Airways, some with multiple daily flights.
458560	462780	Today though, there is only one sole flight by a European airline to Australia—British
462780	466060	Airways' once daily flight from London to Singapore to Sydney.
466060	470400	Meanwhile, Qantas is the only Australian airline and Air New Zealand is the only Kiwi airline
470400	472700	to operate services all the way to Europe.
472700	477540	All the airlines on each end have lost market share to those in between—the Asian airlines.
477540	481160	In the past few decades, airlines like Emirates and Singapore Airlines have become the most
481160	485140	popular for those traveling between the two areas as, if you were to fly British Airways
485140	487800	you would have to start in Sydney and end in London.
487800	491920	Flying on Emirates, on the other hand, you can start at any of their six non-stop destinations
491920	496200	in Australia and New Zealand, connect via Dubai, and end up at any of their dozens of
496200	498900	European destinations with just one stop.
498900	503400	It's just faster and often cheaper and so, while British Airways operates seven weekly
503400	508920	flights to Australia, Emirates operates 84 and Singapore 137.
508920	512760	Both of these airlines and more, including Cathay Pacific, Etihad, and Qatar Airways,
512760	516480	have become experts in operating connecting flights between Europe and Australasia, but
516480	520560	the reason they're able to do this is because you have to stop on these routes anyways—it's
520560	524100	too far for non-stop flights, or rather, it used to be.
524100	528560	Since March 2018, number three on that list of longest flights is Qantas' new non-stop
528560	530340	flight from Perth to London.
530340	533700	Many were skeptical when this flight launched that customers would prefer it to a one-stop
533700	536980	option where they could pay less and stretch their legs halfway through the trip but the
536980	538860	data proves otherwise.
538860	542860	Since launch, 92% of available seats on this route have been sold.
542860	546840	This is an exceptionally good load factor, as it's called, as Qantas' average load
546840	550200	factor for international flights is only 84%.
550200	554080	For this reason, Qantas is strongly considering launching other non-stop European routes from
554080	556140	Perth to Paris and Frankfurt.
556140	559920	In addition, other airlines are looking at starting new non-stop routes from Europe to
559920	560920	Australia.
560920	564360	Founder Richard Branson has said that Virgin Atlantic is looking to start non-stop flights
564360	566880	from London to Perth as soon as possible.
566880	571060	Turkish Airlines, based in Istanbul, is technically still a European airline, even if it's just
571060	574640	miles from the border with Asia, and it's set to become the first airline to start flying
574640	578200	non-stop from Europe to Sydney if it follows through with its announced plans to launch
578200	582140	these flights in 2019 with its new 787 Dreamliners.
582140	585920	While the once daily Qantas flight is doing little to cut into the Asian carrier's profits
585920	590340	right now, if more and more flights start bypassing these Asian hubs, the major connecting
590340	592780	airlines could be given a run for their money.
592780	596380	Meanwhile, the race is on to see who will start flying what is perhaps the most valuable
596380	601100	route in the world that doesn't yet have a non-stop connection—Sydney to London.
601100	603040	Chances are the first will be Qantas.
603040	607020	A number of years ago, Qantas challenged aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus to create
607020	611640	a plane that could fly the 21 hour non-stop flight fully loaded all the way to London.
611640	615400	The manufacturers are close to delivering and Qantas has said they will make the decision
615400	621280	between the Airbus A350-1000ULR or Boeing 777-8 by the end of 2019.
621280	625740	From there flights would start in 2022 or 23 not only on the Sydney to London route
625740	629740	but also potentially from Melbourne and Brisbane and to New York and Paris.
629740	633980	Being the airline of choice for Australians, perhaps no airline globally has a better shot
633980	637900	at making a 21 hour non-stop flight work than Qantas.
637900	642720	With the arrival of the newest set of planes, airlines can now fly as far as 11,000 miles
642720	643780	non-stop.
643780	648660	That means that nearly every populated point on earth can feasibly be connected by non-stop
648660	649660	flights.
649660	653120	With more technological advancements on their way, absolutely every point on earth will
653120	655080	soon be reachable non-stop.
655080	658600	What that means is that the only factors now restricting the development of ultra-long
658600	661660	haul flights are economic, not technological.
661660	665420	In many ways, the question of whether this trend of the proliferation of ultra-long haul
665420	667840	flights is up to the mercy of fuel prices.
667840	672260	If they stay low, we'll have more and more of 18, 19, or 20 hour flights while if they
672260	675980	go up, you can be sure that airlines will cancel these routes in droves.
675980	679680	While these planes are not flying any faster, they're getting passengers to their destination
679680	683600	in less time so these new non-stop routes to the other side of the world are helping
683600	687880	to make the world just a little bit smaller one flight at a time.
687880	691280	If you have an idea for a business, whether it be just you as a freelancer or the next
691280	695920	fortune 500 company, one of the first steps in making an idea reality is setting up a
695920	696920	website.
