00:07.360 --> 00:11.180
Seventeen years ago, an aviation frontier was broken.

00:11.180 --> 00:16.780
Just before noon on March 1st, 2001, a Continental Airlines 777 lifted off from frosty Newark

00:16.780 --> 00:19.480
airport across the river from New York City.

00:19.480 --> 00:24.080
It tracked north over the US, then Canada, and then just kept flying north until north

00:24.080 --> 00:25.080
became south.

00:25.080 --> 00:29.480
It flew south over Russia, then Mongolia, then mainland China before setting down at

00:29.480 --> 00:33.420
Chek Lap Kok airport in Hong Kong after 16 hours.

00:33.420 --> 00:36.240
With that, there was a new longest flight in the world.

00:36.240 --> 00:40.480
The two cities had never before been connected by non-stop commercial flights.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.440
This was, at the time, a momentous achievement.

00:43.440 --> 00:47.160
All the business travelers making frequent trips between the two financial centers badly

00:47.160 --> 00:51.680
wanted this quicker flight, but you may be surprised that such a flight was an achievement

00:51.680 --> 00:53.000
so recently.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.580
Nowadays, non-stop Newark to Hong Kong flights are far from exceptional.

00:57.740 --> 01:02.540
Five planes carrying more than 1,000 passengers total fly non-stop daily between the two cities

01:02.540 --> 01:06.740
and nowadays, this route doesn't even crack the list of the top 20 longest flights in

01:06.740 --> 01:07.740
the world.

01:07.740 --> 01:11.620
Especially in the past three years, there's been a noticeable and dramatic rise in the

01:11.620 --> 01:14.140
number of ultra-long-haul flights.

01:14.140 --> 01:18.460
Among the 10 longest non-stop flights, the one on this list that's existed the longest,

01:18.460 --> 01:23.020
since 2009, is Delta's daily service from Johannesburg to Atlanta—the only flight

01:23.020 --> 01:25.220
by an American airline to South Africa.

01:25.220 --> 01:29.500
In 2016, United started non-stop flights between San Francisco and Singapore, ending

01:29.500 --> 01:33.280
an era during which there were no non-stop connections between the two countries.

01:33.280 --> 01:37.720
Just recently, in October 2018, Philippine Airlines began flying from Manila to New York

01:37.720 --> 01:39.800
non-stop on their new A350.

01:39.800 --> 01:44.460
In 2014, Qantas started flying non-stop in both directions from Sydney to Dallas—then

01:44.460 --> 01:46.340
the longest flight in the world.

01:46.340 --> 01:50.780
In early 2018, United added another connection to Down Under with their route from Houston

01:50.780 --> 01:51.780
to Sydney.

01:51.780 --> 01:56.580
Singapore Airlines added another US connection in November 2018 flying from Los Angeles and

01:56.580 --> 02:00.780
Emirates has operated the longest non-stop A380 flight in the world from Dubai to Auckland

02:00.780 --> 02:02.460
since 2016.

02:02.460 --> 02:06.220
Qantas started the first and currently only non-stop connection between Australia and

02:06.220 --> 02:11.060
Europe in March 2018 with their daily Dreamliner service from Perth to London and Qatar operates

02:11.060 --> 02:15.420
what was until recently the longest non-stop flight from Doha all the way to Auckland.

02:15.420 --> 02:20.300
Lastly, the longest flight in the world, confidently beating the runner up by over 500 miles, is

02:20.300 --> 02:24.260
the newly launched daily Singapore Airlines flight between Singapore and Newark clocking

02:24.260 --> 02:30.220
in at 9,534 miles and up to 19 hours of flight time depending on winds.

02:30.220 --> 02:34.180
8 of the 10 flights on this list were launched in the past three years.

02:34.180 --> 02:38.360
While it can be expected that as technology advances airplane range will get longer, there's

02:38.360 --> 02:42.780
been a noticeable acceleration in the addition of non-stop routes between earth's furthest

02:42.780 --> 02:43.840
city pairs.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.020
Like any phenomenon, this has causes and effects.

02:47.020 --> 02:51.060
One factor driving this surge in ultra-long-haul flights is the release of two new planes in

02:51.060 --> 02:54.580
the past decade—the A350 and 787.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.780
Six of the 10 longest routes are flown by one of these two planes.

02:57.780 --> 03:01.780
Now, planes have existed before that could fly the routes these fly but they weren't

03:01.780 --> 03:03.020
as economical.

03:03.020 --> 03:06.460
Singapore Airlines previously flew the world's longest flight from Singapore to Newark from

03:06.460 --> 03:11.540
2004 until 2014 on their A340 but its high fuel consumption forced them to cancel the

03:11.540 --> 03:14.220
route as soon as oil prices ticked up.

03:14.220 --> 03:19.820
To fly fewer passengers a shorter maximum distance, the A340 uses 35% more fuel than

03:19.820 --> 03:21.020
the A350.

03:21.020 --> 03:24.380
Economics is everything with the world's longest routes.

03:24.380 --> 03:28.640
The truth is that flying a non-stop flight from Singapore to New York uses more fuel

03:28.640 --> 03:32.500
than flying a stopping service from Singapore to Tokyo to New York.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.700
Now, this might seem counter-intuitive since planes use far more fuel per minute taking

03:36.700 --> 03:41.580
off than they do in cruise and flying non-stop requires one take-off instead of two but that's

03:41.580 --> 03:44.720
appealing to consider that it uses fuel to carry fuel.

03:44.720 --> 03:50.300
With a 777-200, for example, flying 800 nautical miles will use about 30.6 pounds of fuel per

03:50.300 --> 03:51.300
mile.

03:51.300 --> 03:55.060
That pounds per mile average decreases up until reaching a total flight distance of

03:55.060 --> 03:57.300
about 3,000 nautical miles.

03:57.300 --> 04:02.540
Beyond that, the pounds per mile figure increases up until 8,000 nautical miles where the aircraft

04:02.540 --> 04:06.100
would burn 32.2 pounds of fuel per mile flown.

04:06.100 --> 04:10.220
This is because eventually, the added fuel from flying the extra fuel needed to fly long

04:10.220 --> 04:13.860
distance overtakes the extra fuel used to take off.

04:13.860 --> 04:18.100
That means that, with this aircraft, which is used to fly the daily 8,000 mile Qatar

04:18.100 --> 04:22.480
flight between Doha and Houston, it would be more efficient on a fuel consumption basis

04:22.480 --> 04:26.920
to fly something like Doha to Paris, Paris to Halifax, and Halifax to Houston rather

04:26.920 --> 04:29.120
than flying the whole trip in one go.

04:29.120 --> 04:33.420
This is part of the reason why cargo airlines rarely fly ultra-long-haul routes.

04:33.420 --> 04:37.060
While UPS has plenty enough cargo to support a non-stop flight between their Louisville

04:37.060 --> 04:40.760
and Hong Kong hubs and the aircraft that could fly it in one go, they fly the route

04:40.760 --> 04:44.140
with a stop in Anchorage partially for fuel saving reasons.

04:44.140 --> 04:47.980
Of course, any time on the ground is time that an aircraft could be in the air making

04:47.980 --> 04:52.380
money so that degrades the savings and that's part of why cargo airlines don't only fly

04:52.380 --> 04:54.540
in 3,000 mile hops.

04:54.540 --> 04:59.140
Time matters for cargo airlines but not nearly as much as it does for passenger airlines.

04:59.140 --> 05:02.500
Passenger airlines have to deal with people which are far more sensitive to a few extra

05:02.500 --> 05:05.100
hours of travel time than boxes.

05:05.140 --> 05:08.520
Non-stop flights are typically more desirable especially to the business traveler which

05:08.520 --> 05:12.820
is why airlines will price connecting itineraries typically higher than non-stop ones even on

05:12.820 --> 05:16.880
short routes where the cost to the airline of operating a connecting itinerary is higher

05:16.880 --> 05:18.780
than that of a non-stop flight.

05:18.780 --> 05:23.160
With higher costs, airlines therefore need to justify operating non-stop flights instead

05:23.160 --> 05:24.300
of stopping ones.

05:24.300 --> 05:28.420
Singapore Airlines does operate another flight to New York via Frankfurt with a far larger

05:28.420 --> 05:32.660
A380 but the non-stop flight is primarily operated to appeal to the business traveler

05:32.660 --> 05:34.020
who can pay more.

05:34.020 --> 05:37.660
Often, the routes with enough demand to support ultra-long-haul flights are the ones with

05:37.660 --> 05:41.780
high business traffic between big wealthy cities like Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong,

05:41.780 --> 05:43.160
London, and New York.

05:43.160 --> 05:47.260
Even though Hawaii, for example, is one of the top vacation destinations in the world,

05:47.260 --> 05:50.880
you just don't see many long-haul flights to it from places like London because leisure

05:50.880 --> 05:55.180
travelers are more sensitive to price and they'd rather pay less to fly via Los Angeles

05:55.180 --> 05:57.660
rather than on a non-stop from London for more.

05:57.660 --> 06:01.860
For this reason, on the A350s Singapore Airlines uses to fly to Newark, they didn't even

06:01.860 --> 06:05.620
bother including an economy class—the kind that leisure travelers tend to book.

06:05.620 --> 06:08.400
They only have premium economy and business class.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.400
With the lower weight from fewer bags, seats, and passengers, the plane can fly more efficiently

06:12.400 --> 06:16.120
to the other side of the world and, from the airlines' perspective, they're not losing

06:16.120 --> 06:19.940
out on much since, at the prices they would have to sell economy seats to be competitive,

06:19.940 --> 06:22.660
they really wouldn't be making much money anyways.

06:22.660 --> 06:26.420
The higher margins of premium classes give them a better shot of breaking even on this

06:26.420 --> 06:27.420
flight.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.580
Of course, the other factor contributing to the rise of these ultra-long-haul flights

06:30.580 --> 06:32.520
is the low cost of fuel.

06:32.520 --> 06:37.740
Jet fuel prices halved in 2015 and bottomed out at a cost of only 85 cents per gallon

06:37.740 --> 06:39.840
in January 2016.

06:39.840 --> 06:43.280
Since then prices have steadily risen leading some to question whether troubled times were

06:43.280 --> 06:47.500
ahead for the industry, but prices again took a dive in October 2018.

06:47.500 --> 06:52.380
Overall, over the past four years, prices are lower than ever and with that fuel represents

06:52.380 --> 06:56.580
a smaller proportion of an airline's cost so it's proportionally cheaper to fly longer

06:56.580 --> 06:57.580
distances.

06:57.580 --> 07:02.420
This fluctuation in fuel cost has also contributed to the rise, and in some cases fall, of long-haul

07:02.420 --> 07:06.220
budget airlines such as Norwegian Airlines, Wow Air, and Primera Air.

07:06.220 --> 07:10.400
So, we've established the causes of this proliferation of ultra-long-haul flights but

07:10.400 --> 07:12.340
what are its effects?

07:12.340 --> 07:16.000
One of the busiest long-distance flows of passengers is from Europe to Australia and

07:16.000 --> 07:17.760
New Zealand and vice versa.

07:17.760 --> 07:21.620
As two areas with close cultural and business connections, plenty of people travel between

07:21.620 --> 07:25.340
them despite it taking about 24 hours each way.

07:25.340 --> 07:29.260
Over the turn of the century almost every major European airline flew to Australia via

07:29.260 --> 07:34.700
some stopping point like Bangkok, Singapore, or Hong Kong including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa,

07:34.700 --> 07:38.560
Alitalia, and British Airways, some with multiple daily flights.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.780
Today though, there is only one sole flight by a European airline to Australia—British

07:42.780 --> 07:46.060
Airways' once daily flight from London to Singapore to Sydney.

07:46.060 --> 07:50.400
Meanwhile, Qantas is the only Australian airline and Air New Zealand is the only Kiwi airline

07:50.400 --> 07:52.700
to operate services all the way to Europe.

07:52.700 --> 07:57.540
All the airlines on each end have lost market share to those in between—the Asian airlines.

07:57.540 --> 08:01.160
In the past few decades, airlines like Emirates and Singapore Airlines have become the most

08:01.160 --> 08:05.140
popular for those traveling between the two areas as, if you were to fly British Airways

08:05.140 --> 08:07.800
you would have to start in Sydney and end in London.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.920
Flying on Emirates, on the other hand, you can start at any of their six non-stop destinations

08:11.920 --> 08:16.200
in Australia and New Zealand, connect via Dubai, and end up at any of their dozens of

08:16.200 --> 08:18.900
European destinations with just one stop.

08:18.900 --> 08:23.400
It's just faster and often cheaper and so, while British Airways operates seven weekly

08:23.400 --> 08:28.920
flights to Australia, Emirates operates 84 and Singapore 137.

08:28.920 --> 08:32.760
Both of these airlines and more, including Cathay Pacific, Etihad, and Qatar Airways,

08:32.760 --> 08:36.480
have become experts in operating connecting flights between Europe and Australasia, but

08:36.480 --> 08:40.560
the reason they're able to do this is because you have to stop on these routes anyways—it's

08:40.560 --> 08:44.100
too far for non-stop flights, or rather, it used to be.

08:44.100 --> 08:48.560
Since March 2018, number three on that list of longest flights is Qantas' new non-stop

08:48.560 --> 08:50.340
flight from Perth to London.

08:50.340 --> 08:53.700
Many were skeptical when this flight launched that customers would prefer it to a one-stop

08:53.700 --> 08:56.980
option where they could pay less and stretch their legs halfway through the trip but the

08:56.980 --> 08:58.860
data proves otherwise.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.860
Since launch, 92% of available seats on this route have been sold.

09:02.860 --> 09:06.840
This is an exceptionally good load factor, as it's called, as Qantas' average load

09:06.840 --> 09:10.200
factor for international flights is only 84%.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.080
For this reason, Qantas is strongly considering launching other non-stop European routes from

09:14.080 --> 09:16.140
Perth to Paris and Frankfurt.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.920
In addition, other airlines are looking at starting new non-stop routes from Europe to

09:19.920 --> 09:20.920
Australia.

09:20.920 --> 09:24.360
Founder Richard Branson has said that Virgin Atlantic is looking to start non-stop flights

09:24.360 --> 09:26.880
from London to Perth as soon as possible.

09:26.880 --> 09:31.060
Turkish Airlines, based in Istanbul, is technically still a European airline, even if it's just

09:31.060 --> 09:34.640
miles from the border with Asia, and it's set to become the first airline to start flying

09:34.640 --> 09:38.200
non-stop from Europe to Sydney if it follows through with its announced plans to launch

09:38.200 --> 09:42.140
these flights in 2019 with its new 787 Dreamliners.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.920
While the once daily Qantas flight is doing little to cut into the Asian carrier's profits

09:45.920 --> 09:50.340
right now, if more and more flights start bypassing these Asian hubs, the major connecting

09:50.340 --> 09:52.780
airlines could be given a run for their money.

09:52.780 --> 09:56.380
Meanwhile, the race is on to see who will start flying what is perhaps the most valuable

09:56.380 --> 10:01.100
route in the world that doesn't yet have a non-stop connection—Sydney to London.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.040
Chances are the first will be Qantas.

10:03.040 --> 10:07.020
A number of years ago, Qantas challenged aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus to create

10:07.020 --> 10:11.640
a plane that could fly the 21 hour non-stop flight fully loaded all the way to London.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.400
The manufacturers are close to delivering and Qantas has said they will make the decision

10:15.400 --> 10:21.280
between the Airbus A350-1000ULR or Boeing 777-8 by the end of 2019.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.740
From there flights would start in 2022 or 23 not only on the Sydney to London route

10:25.740 --> 10:29.740
but also potentially from Melbourne and Brisbane and to New York and Paris.

10:29.740 --> 10:33.980
Being the airline of choice for Australians, perhaps no airline globally has a better shot

10:33.980 --> 10:37.900
at making a 21 hour non-stop flight work than Qantas.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.720
With the arrival of the newest set of planes, airlines can now fly as far as 11,000 miles

10:42.720 --> 10:43.780
non-stop.

10:43.780 --> 10:48.660
That means that nearly every populated point on earth can feasibly be connected by non-stop

10:48.660 --> 10:49.660
flights.

10:49.660 --> 10:53.120
With more technological advancements on their way, absolutely every point on earth will

10:53.120 --> 10:55.080
soon be reachable non-stop.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.600
What that means is that the only factors now restricting the development of ultra-long

10:58.600 --> 11:01.660
haul flights are economic, not technological.

11:01.660 --> 11:05.420
In many ways, the question of whether this trend of the proliferation of ultra-long haul

11:05.420 --> 11:07.840
flights is up to the mercy of fuel prices.

11:07.840 --> 11:12.260
If they stay low, we'll have more and more of 18, 19, or 20 hour flights while if they

11:12.260 --> 11:15.980
go up, you can be sure that airlines will cancel these routes in droves.

11:15.980 --> 11:19.680
While these planes are not flying any faster, they're getting passengers to their destination

11:19.680 --> 11:23.600
in less time so these new non-stop routes to the other side of the world are helping

11:23.600 --> 11:27.880
to make the world just a little bit smaller one flight at a time.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.280
If you have an idea for a business, whether it be just you as a freelancer or the next

11:31.280 --> 11:35.920
fortune 500 company, one of the first steps in making an idea reality is setting up a

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
