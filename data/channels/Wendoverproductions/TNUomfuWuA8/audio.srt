3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,180
Seventeen years ago, an aviation frontier was broken.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:16,780
Just before noon on March 1st, 2001, a Continental Airlines 777 lifted off from frosty Newark

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,480
airport across the river from New York City.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,080
It tracked north over the US, then Canada, and then just kept flying north until north

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,080
became south.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,480
It flew south over Russia, then Mongolia, then mainland China before setting down at

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,420
Chek Lap Kok airport in Hong Kong after 16 hours.

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,240
With that, there was a new longest flight in the world.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,480
The two cities had never before been connected by non-stop commercial flights.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
This was, at the time, a momentous achievement.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,160
All the business travelers making frequent trips between the two financial centers badly

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,680
wanted this quicker flight, but you may be surprised that such a flight was an achievement

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,000
so recently.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,580
Nowadays, non-stop Newark to Hong Kong flights are far from exceptional.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,540
Five planes carrying more than 1,000 passengers total fly non-stop daily between the two cities

18
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,740
and nowadays, this route doesn't even crack the list of the top 20 longest flights in

19
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
the world.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,620
Especially in the past three years, there's been a noticeable and dramatic rise in the

21
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,140
number of ultra-long-haul flights.

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,460
Among the 10 longest non-stop flights, the one on this list that's existed the longest,

23
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:23,020
since 2009, is Delta's daily service from Johannesburg to Atlanta—the only flight

24
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,220
by an American airline to South Africa.

25
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,500
In 2016, United started non-stop flights between San Francisco and Singapore, ending

26
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,280
an era during which there were no non-stop connections between the two countries.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,720
Just recently, in October 2018, Philippine Airlines began flying from Manila to New York

28
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,800
non-stop on their new A350.

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,460
In 2014, Qantas started flying non-stop in both directions from Sydney to Dallas—then

30
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,340
the longest flight in the world.

31
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,780
In early 2018, United added another connection to Down Under with their route from Houston

32
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,780
to Sydney.

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,580
Singapore Airlines added another US connection in November 2018 flying from Los Angeles and

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,780
Emirates has operated the longest non-stop A380 flight in the world from Dubai to Auckland

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,460
since 2016.

36
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,220
Qantas started the first and currently only non-stop connection between Australia and

37
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,060
Europe in March 2018 with their daily Dreamliner service from Perth to London and Qatar operates

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,420
what was until recently the longest non-stop flight from Doha all the way to Auckland.

39
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,300
Lastly, the longest flight in the world, confidently beating the runner up by over 500 miles, is

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,260
the newly launched daily Singapore Airlines flight between Singapore and Newark clocking

41
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,220
in at 9,534 miles and up to 19 hours of flight time depending on winds.

42
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,180
8 of the 10 flights on this list were launched in the past three years.

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,360
While it can be expected that as technology advances airplane range will get longer, there's

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,780
been a noticeable acceleration in the addition of non-stop routes between earth's furthest

45
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,840
city pairs.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,020
Like any phenomenon, this has causes and effects.

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,060
One factor driving this surge in ultra-long-haul flights is the release of two new planes in

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,580
the past decade—the A350 and 787.

49
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,780
Six of the 10 longest routes are flown by one of these two planes.

50
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,780
Now, planes have existed before that could fly the routes these fly but they weren't

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,020
as economical.

52
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,460
Singapore Airlines previously flew the world's longest flight from Singapore to Newark from

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,540
2004 until 2014 on their A340 but its high fuel consumption forced them to cancel the

54
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,220
route as soon as oil prices ticked up.

55
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,820
To fly fewer passengers a shorter maximum distance, the A340 uses 35% more fuel than

56
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,020
the A350.

57
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,380
Economics is everything with the world's longest routes.

58
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,640
The truth is that flying a non-stop flight from Singapore to New York uses more fuel

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,500
than flying a stopping service from Singapore to Tokyo to New York.

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,700
Now, this might seem counter-intuitive since planes use far more fuel per minute taking

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,580
off than they do in cruise and flying non-stop requires one take-off instead of two but that's

62
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,720
appealing to consider that it uses fuel to carry fuel.

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,300
With a 777-200, for example, flying 800 nautical miles will use about 30.6 pounds of fuel per

64
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
mile.

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,060
That pounds per mile average decreases up until reaching a total flight distance of

66
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,300
about 3,000 nautical miles.

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,540
Beyond that, the pounds per mile figure increases up until 8,000 nautical miles where the aircraft

68
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,100
would burn 32.2 pounds of fuel per mile flown.

69
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,220
This is because eventually, the added fuel from flying the extra fuel needed to fly long

70
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:13,860
distance overtakes the extra fuel used to take off.

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,100
That means that, with this aircraft, which is used to fly the daily 8,000 mile Qatar

72
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,480
flight between Doha and Houston, it would be more efficient on a fuel consumption basis

73
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,920
to fly something like Doha to Paris, Paris to Halifax, and Halifax to Houston rather

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,120
than flying the whole trip in one go.

75
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,420
This is part of the reason why cargo airlines rarely fly ultra-long-haul routes.

76
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:37,060
While UPS has plenty enough cargo to support a non-stop flight between their Louisville

77
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,760
and Hong Kong hubs and the aircraft that could fly it in one go, they fly the route

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,140
with a stop in Anchorage partially for fuel saving reasons.

79
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,980
Of course, any time on the ground is time that an aircraft could be in the air making

80
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,380
money so that degrades the savings and that's part of why cargo airlines don't only fly

81
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,540
in 3,000 mile hops.

82
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,140
Time matters for cargo airlines but not nearly as much as it does for passenger airlines.

83
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,500
Passenger airlines have to deal with people which are far more sensitive to a few extra

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
hours of travel time than boxes.

85
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,520
Non-stop flights are typically more desirable especially to the business traveler which

86
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,820
is why airlines will price connecting itineraries typically higher than non-stop ones even on

87
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,880
short routes where the cost to the airline of operating a connecting itinerary is higher

88
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,780
than that of a non-stop flight.

89
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,160
With higher costs, airlines therefore need to justify operating non-stop flights instead

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,300
of stopping ones.

91
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,420
Singapore Airlines does operate another flight to New York via Frankfurt with a far larger

92
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,660
A380 but the non-stop flight is primarily operated to appeal to the business traveler

93
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,020
who can pay more.

94
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,660
Often, the routes with enough demand to support ultra-long-haul flights are the ones with

95
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:41,780
high business traffic between big wealthy cities like Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong,

96
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,160
London, and New York.

97
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,260
Even though Hawaii, for example, is one of the top vacation destinations in the world,

98
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:50,880
you just don't see many long-haul flights to it from places like London because leisure

99
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,180
travelers are more sensitive to price and they'd rather pay less to fly via Los Angeles

100
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,660
rather than on a non-stop from London for more.

101
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,860
For this reason, on the A350s Singapore Airlines uses to fly to Newark, they didn't even

102
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,620
bother including an economy class—the kind that leisure travelers tend to book.

103
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,400
They only have premium economy and business class.

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,400
With the lower weight from fewer bags, seats, and passengers, the plane can fly more efficiently

105
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,120
to the other side of the world and, from the airlines' perspective, they're not losing

106
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,940
out on much since, at the prices they would have to sell economy seats to be competitive,

107
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,660
they really wouldn't be making much money anyways.

108
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,420
The higher margins of premium classes give them a better shot of breaking even on this

109
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,420
flight.

110
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,580
Of course, the other factor contributing to the rise of these ultra-long-haul flights

111
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,520
is the low cost of fuel.

112
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,740
Jet fuel prices halved in 2015 and bottomed out at a cost of only 85 cents per gallon

113
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,840
in January 2016.

114
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
Since then prices have steadily risen leading some to question whether troubled times were

115
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,500
ahead for the industry, but prices again took a dive in October 2018.

116
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,380
Overall, over the past four years, prices are lower than ever and with that fuel represents

117
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,580
a smaller proportion of an airline's cost so it's proportionally cheaper to fly longer

118
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
distances.

119
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,420
This fluctuation in fuel cost has also contributed to the rise, and in some cases fall, of long-haul

120
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,220
budget airlines such as Norwegian Airlines, Wow Air, and Primera Air.

121
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,400
So, we've established the causes of this proliferation of ultra-long-haul flights but

122
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,340
what are its effects?

123
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,000
One of the busiest long-distance flows of passengers is from Europe to Australia and

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,760
New Zealand and vice versa.

125
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,620
As two areas with close cultural and business connections, plenty of people travel between

126
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,340
them despite it taking about 24 hours each way.

127
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,260
Over the turn of the century almost every major European airline flew to Australia via

128
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,700
some stopping point like Bangkok, Singapore, or Hong Kong including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa,

129
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,560
Alitalia, and British Airways, some with multiple daily flights.

130
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,780
Today though, there is only one sole flight by a European airline to Australia—British

131
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,060
Airways' once daily flight from London to Singapore to Sydney.

132
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,400
Meanwhile, Qantas is the only Australian airline and Air New Zealand is the only Kiwi airline

133
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,700
to operate services all the way to Europe.

134
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,540
All the airlines on each end have lost market share to those in between—the Asian airlines.

135
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,160
In the past few decades, airlines like Emirates and Singapore Airlines have become the most

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,140
popular for those traveling between the two areas as, if you were to fly British Airways

137
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,800
you would have to start in Sydney and end in London.

138
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,920
Flying on Emirates, on the other hand, you can start at any of their six non-stop destinations

139
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,200
in Australia and New Zealand, connect via Dubai, and end up at any of their dozens of

140
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,900
European destinations with just one stop.

141
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,400
It's just faster and often cheaper and so, while British Airways operates seven weekly

142
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,920
flights to Australia, Emirates operates 84 and Singapore 137.

143
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,760
Both of these airlines and more, including Cathay Pacific, Etihad, and Qatar Airways,

144
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,480
have become experts in operating connecting flights between Europe and Australasia, but

145
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:40,560
the reason they're able to do this is because you have to stop on these routes anyways—it's

146
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,100
too far for non-stop flights, or rather, it used to be.

147
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:48,560
Since March 2018, number three on that list of longest flights is Qantas' new non-stop

148
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,340
flight from Perth to London.

149
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,700
Many were skeptical when this flight launched that customers would prefer it to a one-stop

150
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,980
option where they could pay less and stretch their legs halfway through the trip but the

151
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,860
data proves otherwise.

152
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Since launch, 92% of available seats on this route have been sold.

153
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,840
This is an exceptionally good load factor, as it's called, as Qantas' average load

154
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,200
factor for international flights is only 84%.

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,080
For this reason, Qantas is strongly considering launching other non-stop European routes from

156
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,140
Perth to Paris and Frankfurt.

157
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,920
In addition, other airlines are looking at starting new non-stop routes from Europe to

158
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
Australia.

159
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,360
Founder Richard Branson has said that Virgin Atlantic is looking to start non-stop flights

160
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,880
from London to Perth as soon as possible.

161
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,060
Turkish Airlines, based in Istanbul, is technically still a European airline, even if it's just

162
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,640
miles from the border with Asia, and it's set to become the first airline to start flying

163
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,200
non-stop from Europe to Sydney if it follows through with its announced plans to launch

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,140
these flights in 2019 with its new 787 Dreamliners.

165
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,920
While the once daily Qantas flight is doing little to cut into the Asian carrier's profits

166
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,340
right now, if more and more flights start bypassing these Asian hubs, the major connecting

167
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,780
airlines could be given a run for their money.

168
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:56,380
Meanwhile, the race is on to see who will start flying what is perhaps the most valuable

169
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,100
route in the world that doesn't yet have a non-stop connection—Sydney to London.

170
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,040
Chances are the first will be Qantas.

171
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,020
A number of years ago, Qantas challenged aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus to create

172
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,640
a plane that could fly the 21 hour non-stop flight fully loaded all the way to London.

173
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,400
The manufacturers are close to delivering and Qantas has said they will make the decision

174
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,280
between the Airbus A350-1000ULR or Boeing 777-8 by the end of 2019.

175
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,740
From there flights would start in 2022 or 23 not only on the Sydney to London route

176
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,740
but also potentially from Melbourne and Brisbane and to New York and Paris.

177
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,980
Being the airline of choice for Australians, perhaps no airline globally has a better shot

178
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:37,900
at making a 21 hour non-stop flight work than Qantas.

179
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,720
With the arrival of the newest set of planes, airlines can now fly as far as 11,000 miles

180
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,780
non-stop.

181
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,660
That means that nearly every populated point on earth can feasibly be connected by non-stop

182
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
flights.

183
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,120
With more technological advancements on their way, absolutely every point on earth will

184
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,080
soon be reachable non-stop.

185
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,600
What that means is that the only factors now restricting the development of ultra-long

186
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,660
haul flights are economic, not technological.

187
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,420
In many ways, the question of whether this trend of the proliferation of ultra-long haul

188
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,840
flights is up to the mercy of fuel prices.

189
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,260
If they stay low, we'll have more and more of 18, 19, or 20 hour flights while if they

190
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,980
go up, you can be sure that airlines will cancel these routes in droves.

191
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,680
While these planes are not flying any faster, they're getting passengers to their destination

192
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,600
in less time so these new non-stop routes to the other side of the world are helping

193
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,880
to make the world just a little bit smaller one flight at a time.

194
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,280
If you have an idea for a business, whether it be just you as a freelancer or the next

195
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,920
fortune 500 company, one of the first steps in making an idea reality is setting up a

196
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
website.

197
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,360
No matter what you do, it's crucial in this century to have a website and Squarespace

Also, on my other channel, Half as Interesting, I just released a video on the longest duration

208
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,440
non-stop flight to ever exist.

209
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,420
The 32 hour flight Qantas flew from Perth to Sri Lanka during World War II in order

210
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,180
to reconnect the Empire.
