1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
What you're about to watch is a Nebula original, meaning it was first released on Nebula—the

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,520
streaming site founded by myself and plenty of other creators.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,680
Producing this documentary was an enormous project which involved flying myself and a

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,560
crew 10,000 miles to one of the most remote places on earth, and it was entirely funded

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,840
by CuriosityStream.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,520
That's because CuriosityStream has partnered with Nebula to offer a bundle deal where,

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,640
if you sign up at curiositystream.com slash wendover, you also get a Nebula subscription.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,080
Easy as that.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,000
On there you'll find loads of other great originals by independent creators, but for

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:52,040
now to the documentary.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:24,600
It was this precise moment, early on a Saturday afternoon in October, 2017, that changed the

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,060
course of history for one of the world's most remote societies.

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,360
This moment that ended 500 years of isolation from the world, cutting travel time to there

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,320
from six days on a boat to six hours on a plane.

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,440
It was this small moment that changed everything for the island—an island where the thing

16
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,320
they need most of all, as much as it might hurt, is change.

17
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,120
It was this moment that, long in the future, will be recognized as the single most consequential

18
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,240
ever for the island of St Helena.

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,200
You'd be forgiven for not knowing exactly what or where St Helena is.

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,320
It's not a place that one hears a whole lot about.

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,120
If you have heard of it, that's likely thanks to Napoleon.

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,040
It's here, on St Helena, where the infamous emperor of France was exiled by the British

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,960
for the six years preceding his death.

24
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,840
Since then, though, the island has been up to quite a bit.

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,400
It's now home to about 4,500 of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.

26
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,660
Walking a block through its capital of Jamestown, it's tough to go without saying hi and hello

27
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,440
a half dozen times.

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,760
Driving past someone without giving a wave, well, that's practically a crime.

29
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Saints, as the residents are called, are as proudly British as they come and fly their

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,140
Union Jacks copiously and conspicuously.

31
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,920
The island is, after all, a British overseas territory.

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,800
Life on St Helena is quite unlike life in the UK, though.

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,180
They've got their own money, their own accent, their own culture, their own government, but

34
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,360
most of all, what makes life on St Helena different is where it is.

35
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,040
The island sits in the same neighborhood as nothing.

36
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,960
London, Africa is 1,100 miles or 1,800 kilometers to its east.

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,560
Mainland South America is about 2,000 miles or 3,300 kilometers to its west.

38
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,400
London is over 4,600 miles or 7,500 kilometers to its north.

39
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,100
St Helena's isolation defines and shapes it in absolutely every way—including, perhaps

40
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,040
most consequentially, economically.

41
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,600
You see, St Helena is not a wealthy place.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,860
Its GDP per capita averages just above $12,000 compared to about $40,000 in the UK.

43
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,440
The issue is that getting people and things to and from the middle of nowhere costs a

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,580
great deal, so there just aren't too many industries that can profitably operate on

45
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,020
a place as tiny and isolated as St Helena.

46
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,360
The Saints have found a few, though.

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Beyond the traditional goods and services sectors that any small community would have,

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,120
St Helena does have exports.

49
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Coffee, we have some of the rarest coffee in the world, which sells for, I know, 90

50
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,280
to 100 pounds in the United Kingdom for just 100 grams.

51
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,140
If we could increase that to some extent, that would bring revenue to many of the farmers

52
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,140
on the island.

53
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,340
They also sell a good amount of tuna and honey, but then there's another sector that capitalizes

54
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,120
on the island's isolation.

55
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:25,920
The predominant economy here at the moment is niche tourism—diving, history, natural

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,720
history—walking tours, bird watching, those sorts of things, plus also a growing market

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,680
of people who want to get away from it all, are one week away from the internet, and given

58
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,680
the internet prices here, that's quite easy to achieve if you want to do it.

59
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,040
But tourism would be nothing without a means to get off and on to St Helena Island.

60
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,980
It was only recently that this became something the government had to worry about.

61
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,240
In the early days of the island's human history, shipping was what brought a population

62
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,960
to it.

63
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,880
It was the perfect stopping point on the route from the Far East to Europe around the Cape

64
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,640
of Good Hope—so perfect, in fact, that if for a while, the entire island was run by

65
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,120
the British East India Company.

66
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,220
Eventually though, the Suez Canal opened and so fewer boats would round the southern tip

67
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
of Africa.

68
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,780
This, of course, diminished St Helena's importance, but still, up until the 1970s,

69
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,900
the island served as a regular stopping point for ocean liners traveling between the UK

70
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,980
and South Africa, meaning there was a reliable link to the outside world.

71
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:31,540
But then, throughout the 20th century, as air travel grew more popular and profitable,

72
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,000
passenger ocean liners around the world increasingly struggled to fill their ships, and one by

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,620
one closed down.

74
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,900
The last shipping line, with passenger service to St Helena, collapsed in 1977, leaving the

75
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,720
island marooned—with no way to get to the outside world.

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,380
The British stepped in, buying a ship for their overseas territory, which would be called

77
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,620
the RMS St Helena.

78
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,060
The RMS was part cargo ship, part passenger ship.

79
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,900
In the front, she carried dozens of shipping containers, acting as the primary supply line

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:06,500
for the island, and in the back, she was adorned with pools and bars and sun loungers.

81
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,580
Her regular journey consisted of the five nights from Cape Town to St Helena, then she

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,320
would continue on to Ascension Island in two or three nights, where she would meet and

83
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,060
connect her passengers to one of the bi-weekly Royal Air Force flights to the UK.

84
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,540
This method, via Ascension, allowed travelers to get from the UK to St Helena in relative

85
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,180
speed—just four days.

86
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,380
Most though, took the longer route from South Africa.

87
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,940
Locals and tourists alike adored the RMS.

88
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,660
She was thought of as the perfect transition from St Helena to the outside world or vice

89
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,660
versa.

90
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,820
She was a legendary, storied vessel, but after decades of heavy use shuttling passengers

91
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,500
to and from the island, in the early 2000s, the RMS was getting old and worn and the government

92
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,460
started to think about what would replace her.

93
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,820
Initial assessments found that replacing the ship would cost up to $100 million.

94
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,120
This led to the question—with that kind of money, was a ship really the best option?

95
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:07,740
The answer, it turned out, was probably not.

96
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,420
After decades of feasibility studies, discussions, debates, false starts, delays, and bidding,

97
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,180
a contract was produced and with a few quick signatures, life on St Helena would change

98
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
forever.

99
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,620
St Helena was getting an airport.

100
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:28,700
The contract was signed in November 2011 and that's when Basil Reid arrived on the island

101
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,360
to start basically looking at the infrastructure logistics.

102
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,780
They started the first construction or the first moving of soil in 2015 November and

103
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,180
obviously they built various roads up to the airport because they had to get the logistics

104
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,180
up to the airport.

105
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:52,340
They also had a ship that brought in all the materials, logistics, all the space, equipment

106
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,180
that had to obviously help to build the airport.

107
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,560
So they constructed it over four years at the end of 2050.

108
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,900
The runway was completed, most of the terminal buildings were completed, most of the CNS

109
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:10,620
equipment, which is communication and navigation equipment, was installed and the airport was

110
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,600
ready for a certification at the end of October 2015.

111
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,500
New airports are rare.

112
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,260
New airports in places that have never had an airport before are even rarer.

113
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,200
Getting an empty husk of an airport, certified and staffed, is no easy task.

114
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,900
For this to happen on St Helena, subcontractors were streaming through the island.

115
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,620
There were audits upon audits upon audits.

116
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,160
Staff members were recruited.

117
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,600
Locals were trained both on and off island for jobs like security, immigration, firefighting

118
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
and more.

119
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,100
Emergency procedures were written, public meetings were conducted, airport vehicles

120
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:47,540
were shipped in, instruments were calibrated, beacons and localizers and obstacle lights

121
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,020
were installed, a logo was designed, calibration flights came in, emergency drills were conducted,

122
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,620
drone mods were codified, operational trials were run, and then finally, in February 2016,

123
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,820
the airport was certified and ready to open.

124
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,500
Commercial flights could start, and St Helena would achieve its decades-long ambition of

125
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,060
having an air link to the outside world.

126
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,360
There was just one more step.

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,980
As one last hurdle of bureaucracy, Comair, the airline contracted to operate flights

128
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,780
to St Helena, wanted to perform an implementation flight, as they called it.

129
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,980
Essentially, they were going to fly one of their planes in to test that everything, from

130
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,820
the instruments to the runway to the terminal to the fuel system, worked.

131
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:34,500
Now, Comair was really the perfect airline to connect St Helena to the world.

132
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,260
They're a British Airways franchisee, meaning they are contracted by British Airways to

133
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,660
operate their regional flights from South Africa and therefore fly a number of routes

134
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,640
around the region under the British Airways brand.

135
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,440
The plan was for Comair to operate a British Airways route non-stop from Johannesburg to

136
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,660
St Helena.

137
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,840
These flights would seamlessly connect to other British Airways flights to the two locations

138
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:02,460
Saints travel most—Capetown and London—as well as with hundreds of other destinations

139
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,820
around the world.

140
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,700
With the exception of a direct flight to the UK, there's really nothing better St Helena

141
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,620
Airport could have wished for.

142
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,480
They just had to do the implementation flight.

143
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,120
So, on one sunny, nearly cloudless April day in 2016, a Comair 737 appeared off in

144
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,160
the distance to the north of St Helena Airport carrying a handful of staff members of the

145
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,820
airline and airport construction company.

146
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:30,980
It approached, wheels up, in order to perform a flyby above the runway, as planned.

147
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,360
After gaining altitude again, it circled back around in order to make a second and final

148
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,880
approach.

149
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,060
But then, just seconds away from touchdown, there was a sort of wobble.

150
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,480
Then another one.

151
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,920
Then once its wheels were just feet above the runway, the pilots elected to abort the

152
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,280
landing, go around, and give it another shot.

153
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,960
So, the plane circled around again and, after some more wobbling, came to a landing—the

154
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,600
first ever landing of a commercial passenger jet on the island, even if it wasn't carrying

155
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,960
commercial passengers.

156
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,840
St Helena was thrilled.

157
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm here with Basarites Island Director, Dejan Diake.

158
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,280
Dejan, you just arrived on the first passenger jet to land here on St Helena.

159
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,920
Can you describe the experience?

160
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
Great experience.

161
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,880
I mean, it's just a cherry on the cake after the four years work.

162
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:28,480
Friday, Friday morning, I flew out on the AC flight, I went home, spent the weekend

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,680
with the family, played golf yesterday, and today I'm back on the island.

164
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,120
I mean, that's the signs of the times, eh?

165
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,320
And that's the whole reason for the airport, is to be able to travel back and forth as

166
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,440
you please.

167
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,720
Susan Obey and Graham Vess, guys, you were here to witness the first ever passenger jet

168
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
land on St Helena.

169
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,080
First of all, you, Graham, how does it feel?

170
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,520
Can you describe the experience?

171
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:57,280
It was absolutely amazing and I feel really privileged to be here at this momentous occasion.

172
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,680
It really is such a historic event.

173
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
I feel absolutely wonderful.

174
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,160
I feel proud of everything that's been done by you guys on the island.

175
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Thank you.

176
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,160
And you, Susan?

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,080
Excited, extremely excited.

178
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:17,520
This is like the culmination of weeks, months, years of hard work, as far back as 2005, and

179
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,760
we're really, really proud of everything that's been achieved today.

180
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,340
This is the first step, you know, a plane landing on St Helena.

181
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,520
What does this now mean for tourism on St Helena?

182
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,560
Well, now we've got the gateway to get people here.

183
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,740
Before we had to rely on the ship, the RMS coming backwards and forwards.

184
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,280
This means we can have a steady stream.

185
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,880
At first, it'll be that Saturday flight people will get used to, and then once that's

186
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,400
been filling up, hopefully we'll have a midweek one, and that's the way we can really

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
develop tourism.

188
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,880
And it becomes worth people investing in—restaurants, bars, other things that'll help the tourists

189
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,880
here.

190
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,120
So, the start of a new era for St Helena.

191
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,600
Tourism was ecstatic, but at the time, nobody fully understood what had just happened.

192
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,800
You see, this little wobble—just before landing—had just derailed the decades-long

193
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,000
plan for St Helena's new era.

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,320
That wobble was evidence of wind shear—a phenomenon where wind traveling in one direction

195
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,660
meets wind traveling in another direction and creates a zone of turbulent air.

196
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,680
In St Helena's case, its wind shear was due to the already strong wind being pushed

197
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,340
around and rerouted by the enormous cliffs at the northern end of its runway.

198
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,500
When coming in to land an airplane, wind is already a hassle, but when it quickly shifts,

199
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,500
as in the case of wind shear, it can be a lot worse.

200
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,060
The first sign to the general public that something was wrong was when the St Helena

201
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,180
government postponed the long-scheduled airport opening ceremony, which was planned to be

202
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,460
presided upon by Prince Andrew.

203
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,900
Eventually, it emerged that the solution would be to land planes from the south, as there

204
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:58,840
was not a wind shear issue from this direction, but this did have its own issues.

205
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,980
Planes generally like to land into the wind, as this allows them to stop faster on the

206
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,740
runway, but at the airport, wind almost always comes from the south, meaning planes would

207
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,780
be landing with a tailwind.

208
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,740
In order to successfully land a 737 with a tailwind on the length of runway offered at

209
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,220
St Helena, the 737 would have to be quite light.

210
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,020
It wouldn't be able to take its full capacity of passengers or cargo.

211
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:27,520
In fact, it would have to shed so much weight that the flight would never be commercially

212
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,160
profitable for Comair, even with the planned subsidies, and so, unceremoniously, it was

213
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,020
announced that Comair, and therefore British Airways, would not be running the flights

214
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,620
to St Helena.

215
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,740
Eventually, the story of St Helena Airport reached the world.

216
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,300
The British tabloids got their hands on it and ripped it to shreds.

217
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:54,060
They called the airport embarrassing—a gaffe, a folly, a farcical vanity project.

218
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,100
Much of what was reported wasn't even accurate.

219
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:01,020
Tabloids said it was impossible to land, they said the airport was closed, neither of which

220
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,160
was true.

221
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,420
In fact, throughout the delay, private and medevac flights were coming in and out with

222
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,540
no problem.

223
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,500
The media latched on to the video of that Comair implementation flight and, as one outlet

224
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,220
called it, the terrifying three attempts it took to land.

225
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,860
In reality, it was one planned flyby, one aborted landing, and one successful landing.

226
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,320
In the world of commercial aviation, aborted landings are nothing exceptional.

227
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,180
They happen many times a day at airports large and small all around the world.

228
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,940
Most of all, though, the common thread between all the media reports was the nickname St

229
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,860
Helena Airport received—the world's most useless airport.

230
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,660
That was the one that stunned.

231
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,920
And I think a lot of the sort of initial label given by the popular media has not helped

232
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,700
the island, and I think it's totally false, quite frankly.

233
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,480
We knew that St. Helena was going to get a lot of flak over it from the media.

234
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:05,180
We didn't quite appreciate how much it was going to feature, but it became a lot about

235
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,280
how bad the British government had done in investing in the airport on St. Helena and

236
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,300
putting it in the wrong place, essentially.

237
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,140
When the bad press hit of St. Helena having a white elephant for an airport, I was really

238
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,260
angry.

239
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,140
And still today, in my professional capacity, we are countering and battling to get rid

240
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,900
of that negativity.

241
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,060
It is really bad, and people don't want to see the good that is actually happening.

242
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:39,700
Since all of those articles, we've had to spend a lot of time, I suppose, trying to

243
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,020
sell the island for its positive aspects, and also show things like there's only been

244
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,580
one cancellation in the entire year this year, but those things are harder to get through

245
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,140
than the sensationalist stuff that sells papers.

246
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,820
You always have start and end problems, and what would you expect?

247
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:58,980
We are in the middle of the South Atlantic.

248
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,700
This is the first time for it to happen.

249
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,020
So you've got to have trial and error, and I wish people would just leave the error now

250
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,940
aside and look at what is happening as a result.

251
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,220
In order to shrug off that nickname, they needed, of course, a flight.

252
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,460
So we had to do a lot of research.

253
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,700
So we commissioned our UK Met office to do a lot of research on our wind data.

254
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,380
So we collated a lot of wind data over six months, twelve months, so we could ascertain

255
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,700
exactly what the conditions were on runway 20 and runway 02.

256
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:35,420
Once we got all that data into place, then the SHG government went out with a new tender,

257
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,260
looking for an aircraft that could actually land runway 02, which had a 15 knot tailwind

258
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
component.

259
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,580
It was runway 20 that had the wind shear issue, not runway 02.

260
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,260
These two are, in fact, the same physical runway, but runway 20 refers to the landing

261
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,540
coming from the north, runway 02 refers to the landing from the south.

262
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,180
The prevailing winds originate from the south, so the key to a safe landing was an aircraft

263
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,220
small enough to stop safely within the length of the runway even when wind pushes it from

264
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
behind.

265
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:10,660
That way, if the wind shear from the north is too bad, it can land from the south.

266
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,660
The service was not to be subsidized, but rather underwritten.

267
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:20,660
There isn't a subsidy per passenger, so they don't get paid, let's say, ten pounds

268
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,940
per passenger per flight at all.

269
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:28,700
It's very much a commercial service, but if that commercial service makes a loss, that

270
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,620
loss is underwritten by DFID in the UK.

271
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,480
Two main bidders emerged to operate the flights to St Helena.

272
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,980
The first was a company called Atlantic Star Airlines.

273
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,660
Founded in 2012, still the early days of the airport construction process, Atlantic Star

274
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,340
was created specifically to serve as an airline for St Helena.

275
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,580
Their original plan was to make weekly flights directly from London to St Helena via some

276
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,500
midway refueling stop in addition to a weekly flight to Cape Town.

277
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,020
It was an ambitious plan, but they were serious about it.

278
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,420
The company consisted of seasoned aviation executives and professionals including a CEO

279
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,660
who came from British Airways.

280
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,360
Over time, though, the plan was scaled back to operating a few charter flights a year

281
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,860
from London to St Helena via Banjul in the Gambia.

282
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
This was going to happen.

283
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,540
They had an agreement with TUI Airlines to charter A737, they had announced schedules,

284
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:28,460
they had set fares, but then, of course, the airport's opening was delayed, and these

285
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,160
flights were all cancelled.

286
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,880
After some time, in October 2016, Atlantic Star came back into the story by chartering

287
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,280
an Avro RJ1000 to fly to the island and run a series of test landings—a move the company

288
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,160
tried to use as evidence of their legitimacy in the bidding process.

289
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,920
The proposal was that they would lease an Avro jet to be based on St Helena as the island's

290
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,620
dedicated aircraft.

291
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,200
Twice a week, they would fly the hour and a half north to Ascension Island to connect

292
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,400
with the bi-weekly RAF flights to the UK.

293
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Having the aircraft based on St Helena would, according to their bid, be quite the benefit

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,360
for the island considering that it could, at a moment's notice, fly medical evacuation

295
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,980
flights, rather than waiting for a plane to fly in from South Africa to pick a patient

296
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
up.

297
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,280
Ultimately, though, the bid failed.

298
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,720
The other major bid submitted to the St Helena government was by a South African airline

299
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,680
called Airlink.

300
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:27,360
Their plan was to fly an Embraer E190 jet to St Helena once weekly on Saturdays.

301
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,960
The aircraft would fly from Johannesburg to Windhoek, Namibia where it would meet another

302
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,020
service coming in from Cape Town.

303
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,480
This connecting structure was viewed as quite important since, while most of the St Diaspora

304
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,440
is in Cape Town, Johannesburg is the larger airport and offers more connections.

305
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,880
From Windhoek, it would then fly the three hours over the South Atlantic to land in St

306
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,960
Helena.

307
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,340
It would then do the same in reverse.

308
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,320
Included in Airlink's bid was an agreement to operate once monthly charter flights from

309
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,620
St Helena to Ascension Island as an add-on to their flight from Johannesburg, giving

310
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:03,220
that island, which primarily serves as a military base for the UK and US, its only regularly

311
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,580
scheduled non-military flight to the outside world.

312
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,560
This bid was as close to perfect St Helena was going to get.

313
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,760
On July 21, 2017, the St Helena government signed a contract with Airlink and announced

314
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:20,200
to the world that this tiny South Atlantic outpost was finally getting its connection

315
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
to the world.

316
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,180
St Helena was getting a flight—for real this time.

317
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:29,640
A few months later, just over a year after that Comair flight had arrived in the skies

318
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,000
above St Helena, an Airlink in Rhear E190 did the same.

319
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,900
It was filled with 70 or so journalists, tourists, and saints, and soon enough, safely touched

320
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,740
down and was greeted by, well, a big proportion of St Helena.

321
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,080
That was St Helena's before and after moment.

322
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,460
Once those wheels touched down, St Helena would never be the same.

323
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,180
But once that happened, once the honeymoon period was over, it was time for St Helena

324
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,340
to get to work.

325
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,300
Realizing the full potential of the airport was no easy task.

326
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,420
Of course the natural environment presented its own issues, but the true challenge lies

327
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,600
in the island's geographic isolation and political independence which mean that, in

328
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,300
all aspects, the airport has to be entirely self-sufficient.

329
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,600
They're not run by some big company, they're not part of any national system.

330
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,800
St Helena Airport is run by St Helena Airport Limited and, if Gwyneth Howell, its CEO, doesn't

331
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,660
know what to do, there's not really anyone she can call.

332
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,360
That means that everything needed to run St Helena Airport, from administrative to operational,

333
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,600
has to happen at St Helena Airport.

334
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,160
It turns out that, even with just one weekly flight, that's quite a lot.

335
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:49,120
What we have is, for example, in this room here, we have what's called CNS, so Communications,

336
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,060
Navigations and Surveillance.

337
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,500
We have two guys, one who works on IT side of things, one who works on the navigation

338
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,420
aids and so on.

339
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,660
They're really crucial to the running of the airport.

340
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,420
Without the Communications, Navigations system, without those IT systems in place, we wouldn't

341
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,460
be able to land aircraft and take off aircraft here at the airport.

342
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,320
That's extremely important.

343
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,840
CEO's office, obviously we need a Chief Executive Officer for St Helena Airport Limited and

344
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,480
then there's my office next door.

345
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:28,880
I'm kind of the CEO's right-hand person, so I will always be there to support them, but

346
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,720
I'm also kind of separate as well, because I'm meant to be there to be the conscience

347
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,120
almost of the company, to do the thinking, to do the questioning, why are we doing it

348
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
like that?

349
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,260
Could we do it another way?

350
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Could we do it a safer way?

351
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Could we do it a better way?

352
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,220
So that's a pretty important role.

353
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,360
So if we carry on this way, actually, this is an important room to look in.

354
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:58,880
It's the gym and it's where our RFS team keep fit.

355
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,060
Being in the Firefighting Service, it's a very physical job, so you need to be fit all

356
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,060
the time.

357
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,660
In fact, there are fitness levels to be met, so the gym is an important part of that.

358
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Hello, Bill.

359
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Hello.

360
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,200
Security.

361
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:19,400
Because I'm not security cleared, I can't go in there, even though I'm sort of senior

362
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,400
management team.

363
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,640
There are still levels of security that some of us can't get into, and this is one room

364
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,280
that I'm not permitted to go into, and rightly so.

365
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,320
So if you want to follow me down in the rest of the combined building, so we have a training

366
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,060
room, so there's an awful lot of training that goes on for staff.

367
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,740
We need to be accredited in many respects, so there's a lot of training that goes on

368
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,660
security in particular, but also firefighting as well.

369
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:53,100
So that's our training room.

370
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:03,620
Walking on further down, we also have a maintenance bay as well, which I'll briefly open the door,

371
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,620
and walk in.

372
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,800
The maintenance bay is where we obviously maintain equipment, and we have a lot of equipment

373
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,520
to maintain, and we have an on-site mechanic who does so.

374
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,960
So we also use it for storage as well.

375
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:28,280
So this, for example, is a tow barless tug, allows us to tow aircraft if we need to, and

376
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,980
other bits and pieces like the toilet cart and so on.

377
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:39,200
So it's a multi-purpose bay, we use it for storage and we use it for maintaining our

378
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
vehicles.

379
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:49,780
So if we're moving along, finally come to the end, and it's the most important room

380
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,960
in the building because these people make sure we get paid.

381
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:02,120
So here we have, good afternoon, we have HR and Finance.

382
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:10,080
Really important to running a small but compact airport.

383
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,500
But nevertheless, there's all the HR and financial functions that go with that.

384
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,580
In addition to all the administrative functions, St Helena airport, while it might need less

385
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,440
of it, needs all the same things that an enormous airport like Heathrow would need.

386
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,300
A striking example of this is the fire service.

387
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:31,740
ICAO regulation basically states that every airport has to have some sort of firefighter

388
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,740
category.

389
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,680
It really depends on the movement of the aircraft within that airfield.

390
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,080
That's regulation and that is what we have to provide.

391
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,440
We are always on standby, so if there's an aircraft emergency right now and we get

392
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,040
the crash alarms go, we can provide a three-minute response to the runway.

393
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,360
That's despite the fact that most days, there isn't a single aircraft within hundreds

394
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,700
of miles of the island, but nonetheless, it's what's required by regulation.

395
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,800
Even at an airport with thousands of weekly flights, it's not as if firefighters are

396
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,920
responding to fires all that often, which means that there's no real reason for those

397
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,980
airports to have more than one firefighting crew.

398
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,840
The result is that an airport like St Helena, which has one or two commercial flights a

399
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:19,200
week, needs firefighting capabilities pretty similar to an airport like Heathrow, which

400
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
has thousands.

401
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,160
That's part of what balloons the cost of running such a small airport.

402
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,500
Given the isolation of the island, weather forecasting is another crucially important

403
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,460
yet challenging part of what's needed to keep the weekly flight reliable and safe.

404
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:39,860
The UK Met Office stations meteorologists on St Helena on more or less yearly rotations.

405
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,860
After a Saturday flight, I usually have the Sunday and Monday off, so when I come in on

406
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,420
Tuesday, that's when I first start looking at what the weather's going to be like for

407
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,500
the next flight day, which is usually the Saturday.

408
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:56,260
As we get nearer to the time, I start to do more detailed forecasts for the airline.

409
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:03,700
So on a Friday, I produce a detailed forecast for their estimated time of arrival on Saturday.

410
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:08,720
And then I come in at four o'clock on the Saturday morning and update that forecast

411
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,960
and forward that to the flight operations.

412
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,600
The reason this is so important is so that they know, when an aircraft is supposed to

413
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,620
get to St Helena airport, it'll be able to land at St Helena airport.

414
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:28,700
The main problem is because of the remoteness of the airfield, there are no nearby diversions,

415
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,820
so they can't arrive here and spend two hours circling and then divert to a nearby

416
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,920
airfield.

417
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:40,120
If they come here, then they've got to be 99% convinced that they're going to be able

418
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,520
to land.

419
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,640
So I will be looking at cloud basin visibility as the major things that would stop them from

420
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,180
landing at St Helena.

421
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:57,320
The reason being, because of their restrictions, they have to be visual with the airfield before

422
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,000
they can land.

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,180
So if the cloud base is below 900 feet, then they won't be able to see the airfield before

424
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,740
their decision hike.

425
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,560
Assuming the airline has that required level of confidence that the flight will be able

426
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,340
to successfully land at St Helena, AirLink will give it clearance to depart from Johannesburg

427
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,400
at about 9 am local time.

428
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:22,300
It'll then make the two-hour flight to Walvis Bay, Namibia—a more or less regular flight.

429
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,160
At Walvis Bay, they'll refuel the aircraft's tanks, giving them about six hours of flying

430
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,560
time, but also at this top, they'll have to once again decide whether they'll be

431
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,900
able to land at St Helena.

432
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,780
This time, the level of confidence has to be higher than it was even in Johannesburg,

433
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,260
but assuming they are confident, the flight will take off, climb to altitude, and begin

434
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,420
its three-hour ocean crossing—but the decisions still aren't over.

435
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Throughout this crossing, the airline will be continuously evaluating the conditions

436
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,860
on the island to assure they'll be able to land and, if they believe they can't,

437
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,620
they'll turn back for Namibia.

438
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,180
Assuming they continue on, eventually, they will then approach the island, drop altitude,

439
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,360
and connect by radio with the airport's air traffic controller.

440
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,600
But then, even once there, if the cloud levels are too low or the wind is too strong, the

441
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,240
plane still won't be able to land.

442
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,080
So when they get here and they're not able on the first attempt to land, they will do

443
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,800
a go-around, they will go into a holding pattern, and they will wait for a few minutes, based

444
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,840
on what we have in terms of satellite image for the weather.

445
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,560
It could be ten minutes, it could be five minutes, it could be as soon as they go around,

446
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:39,700
when they come back they can see the runway, and then they'll be able to do a landing.

447
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,180
So in the unlikely event that a successful landing cannot be completed, then the aircraft

448
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,680
will have to divert.

449
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:50,240
St Helena's closest diversion point is Ascension Island.

450
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,040
It's about an hour and a half flight north, so this is likely where any flight would divert

451
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,760
if landing at St Helena was not possible.

452
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,400
There they have fuels and facilities so the air-link flight could give landing on St Helena

453
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,480
another shot the day after.

454
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,900
In the time that St Helena airport has been open, no commercial flight has ever failed

455
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,000
landing and had to divert.

456
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,780
In fact, in the first ten months of 2019, the airport didn't even have a single cancelled

457
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,120
flight.

458
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,680
Every Saturday, at about 1.15 pm, an air-link Embraer E190 has reliably pierced through

459
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,520
the clouds above St Helena's airport, ready to drop off another load of eager tourists

460
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,140
and wistful locals.

461
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,620
The holidays at St Helena airport are an event.

462
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,940
Despite its tiny size, people start arriving at the building three to four hours in advance

463
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
of the flight.

464
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,700
While the plane might only seat 96 people, every flight sees a crowd far larger as extended

465
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,020
families of every saint arriving and leaving seem to show up.

466
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,580
Just for the flight day, there opens a bank branch, a gift shop, a luggage wrapping business,

467
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,800
a cafe, and a restaurant.

468
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,260
Those not taking the flight will stand in the check-in hall, looking to see who's

469
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,500
arriving, then make their way up to the restaurant once the passengers pass through security.

470
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,480
Then, as the time draws near, everyone packs into the observation deck—far busier than

471
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,900
that of any of the world's largest airports—and look to the left.

472
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,660
It's reminiscent of sailors watching to be the first to see land, but in this case,

473
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:21,420
it's saints trying to be the first to see their link to the outside world—a world

474
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:24,820
that some of them have only seen through screens.

475
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,400
They try to spot the small metal tube that represents the link between them and us.

476
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,060
With patience, the time comes, and the Embraer E190 appears in St Helena's skies.

477
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:40,460
It makes its approach, usually jostled around by the consistently inconsistent winds, then

478
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,700
passes the daunting cliff at the end of the runway, then glides smoothly into touchdown.

479
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,460
That's when the airport truly comes alive.

480
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,660
Only 75 minutes sits between the scheduled landing time and the scheduled takeoff time

481
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,740
each Saturday, so, as soon as the aircraft takes its right turn towards the apron, there

482
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,300
begins a carefully choreographed dance.

483
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,920
The aircraft is marshalled in, then first to approach are the air stairs followed by

484
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,540
the ground power unit that gives energy to the aircraft when it sits powered down.

485
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,140
While the cleaners approach the aircraft, the baggage compartment of the aircraft is

486
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,460
opened, the fuel truck gets into position, and the first passengers start to disembark.

487
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:23,980
With certain jobs only needing to happen once a week, quite a few staff at the airport

488
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,460
work multiple jobs.

489
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,120
The firefighters, for example, go straight from their truck, assuring that the aircraft

490
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,620
has landed safely, to handling baggage.

491
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,780
At the back of the aircraft, all the sewage from the lavatory has to be emptied and an

492
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:40,020
ambulift is used to lift passengers with reduced mobility on and off.

493
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,380
The pilots qualified to land at St Helena are among the most senior and experienced

494
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,820
at AirLink which means there are fewer than ten pilots who work the route.

495
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,560
Therefore, they visit the island on average about once a month but, since the aircraft

496
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,000
only stays there for just over an hour, have never seen more of the island than the airport.

497
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,860
During their time on the island, though, they'll perform a safety inspection of the plane and

498
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,460
then, soon enough, it'll be time to load up.

499
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,680
Boarding the 96 or fewer passengers doesn't take long and quickly, the door will close,

500
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,780
the stairs will pull away, and the aircraft will taxi back to the runway.

501
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:19,860
It will take a turn to the north, roll its way down to the end of the runway, turn around,

502
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:24,180
then thunder down St Helena's spotlessly clean piece of pavement to take off on its

503
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,300
four and a half hour trip back to Johannesburg.

504
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:32,980
With that, the clock starts ticking again as the airport preps for its next 75 minutes

505
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,740
in the spotlight and then everyone makes their way to their homes or hotels, starting their

506
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,400
next week of isolation from the world.

507
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,240
Of course the Saints love the airport while they're at it—while they're standing

508
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,360
in the observation deck watching the plane fly off, destined for Johannesburg in a quick

509
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,760
four and a half hours.

510
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,560
For those that have lived their entire lives on St Helena, the prospect of getting to South

511
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Africa in a matter of hours still seems like magic.

512
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,200
Once people go home, though, the question that comes up frequently in conversation is,

513
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,200
was it worth it?

514
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,160
2013 and 2014, when they were building the airport, was a big significant boom for St

515
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Helena.

516
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,440
The amount of people that were in and out of the island, a lot of St Helenaians saw

517
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,280
airplane for the first time in their life.

518
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,560
The economy was actually thriving, so it was a buildup to what was the airport going to

519
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
bring for St Helena.

520
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,920
I would say people expected the airport to bring quite significant change.

521
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,400
Now whether those expectations were reasonable is something that is perhaps debatable.

522
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,560
The once a week flight is OK, but at the end of the day, if you bring in a plane which

523
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:57,240
can carry potentially 90 passengers, that's not enough to be able to generate a significant

524
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,600
increase in the footfall on St Helena.

525
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,760
I think there's an expectation that the service perhaps isn't delivering what it

526
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:12,160
should, but I think we also have to take into account the fact that we're still not trying—we're

527
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:20,080
still a relatively untested market, both for tourists and also for potential investors.

528
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:23,800
Looking at the graphs, the airport has had some effect.

529
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,440
In the 12 months after its opening, 3,337 people arrived on the island by plane.

530
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,840
That's compared to just 2,616 passengers who had arrived the previous 12 months on

531
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,100
the RMS.

532
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:43,320
In the airport's second year of operations, 4,188 passengers arrived via the airport,

533
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,760
which certainly is a measurable improvement, although overall visitor arrivals to the island

534
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,960
stayed about the same as there was a period of overlap between the start of flights and

535
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,640
the end of the RMS service.

536
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,440
It's tough to measure the true success of the airport yet, just two years into service,

537
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,200
but what's sure is that there has been no tourism explosion.

538
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,400
Flights are expensive, infrequent, and indirect for everyone but South Africans, and this

539
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,120
has kept the island a niche destination.

540
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,340
The island certainly had to hurry up and wait as, while the first flight might have been

541
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:22,020
the impetus for change, it certainly didn't change everything overnight.

542
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:26,780
Success for St Helena airport, however, cannot be measured solely by visitor numbers.

543
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:32,820
It can also be measured in lives—the number of lives this solitary piece of pavement has

544
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,820
saved.

545
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:39,140
I was in my last trimester, feeling normal pregnancy up until the last when my blood

546
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:41,380
pressure kind of spiked.

547
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:49,580
So the concern was pretty clampsier, and they decided that I needed an emergency cesarean.

548
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:58,700
So Eli was born about four weeks earlier than expected.

549
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:11,220
He—we had him around half sex Wednesday evening, and he had a bit of a restless night,

550
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:19,540
breathing wasn't so good, although that was to be expected because of the C-section.

551
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:27,500
The next morning, the midwife came in, and she said no, breathing wasn't normal, and

552
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:35,620
they decided to put him on the ventilator and have him assessed, so they did so many

553
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:42,100
tests, and he had respiratory distress syndrome.

554
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:52,100
And about, like, eleven-ish on Thursday night, Dr Kevin O'Brien and Helen Lawrence came

555
00:38:52,100 --> 00:39:00,140
in to our room to say that he would need to be medivaced.

556
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:07,020
The RMS was on its last journey to the UK, so the first reaction was, how do we get him

557
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,740
out?

558
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:15,700
And then it was—we were told that they had already decided to get a medivac flight in.

559
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:21,620
Two days after Eli was born, on a Friday afternoon, a small jet from a South African medical evacuation

560
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,500
company touched down at St Helena airport, representing only the fourth arrival by a

561
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,060
fixed-wing aircraft to the island.

562
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,520
The team spent the afternoon evaluating Eli's condition and then early the following morning,

563
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,740
him and his mother, Patrice, were transferred by ambulance to the airport and brought onto

564
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,740
the jet.

565
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,420
After a quick four hours crossing the South Atlantic, they touched down in Cape Town and

566
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,860
by 2pm local time arrived at Vincent Pilati Hospital with all the facilities Eli needed,

567
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:52,060
just about five hours after leaving the hospital in St Helena.

568
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:58,020
If it wasn't for the airport, then I really thought that Eli would have made it.

569
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:03,820
It would have been a long wait for the RMS to come down, like another month, and then

570
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,500
the weeks travel to Cape Town.

571
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,940
He probably wouldn't have made it waiting for the month for the ship to actually get

572
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,940
there.

573
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,860
So, you know, without the airport, I don't think Eli would have made it, would have survived.

574
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,740
Today, Eli is a perfectly healthy young boy.

575
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:27,020
He's one of the handful of saints who quite directly owe their lives to the airport.

576
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:32,160
Construction is dangerous and St Helena's hospital just isn't equipped to handle advanced

577
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,440
medical conditions.

578
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:39,360
Before the airport, that medical risk just came with the territory and in some cases,

579
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:45,460
survival was down to luck—the luck of where the RMS was on its voyage schedule.

580
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,100
One can't easily argue against anything that saves lives, no matter the cost, but

581
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,820
the truth is that, when the British government spent their hundreds of millions of dollars

582
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:59,300
to build St Helena airport, they had more than the humanitarian benefits in mind.

583
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:04,700
In the two years since its opening, the airport has brought change, but it has not yet fundamentally

584
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,340
transformed what St Helena is.

585
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:15,460
I think that the potential for the island is actually really quite strong and I think

586
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:21,860
that, but I think as with all emerging destinations, it's going to take a while.

587
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,020
What I think is worrying, though, is that for a lot of people, it's how long will

588
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,740
that while be?

589
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,800
Is it going to be five years, ten years, twenty years, nobody really knows?

590
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,900
Long term, the airport's ambition is, of course, to grow the island's economy.

591
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,180
The UK's Department for International Development conducted a business case for the airport

592
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:47,880
way back in 2010 and developed a tourism growth estimate for St Helena based on how other

593
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,880
similar islands fared in the industry after improving their access.

594
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:57,900
This model, starting at about 1,000 tourists per year in 2016, projected growth to 30,000

595
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,580
yearly tourists in 2042—a number that has been subject to intense scrutiny everywhere

596
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,720
from the St Helena dinner table to the parliament of the United Kingdom.

597
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,900
The data show, though, that accounting for the one-year delay in the airport's opening,

598
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,660
current visitor arrivals are exactly on target for this growth.

599
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,940
What that means is that the airport project is not doomed from the start.

600
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,380
What will determine its success is what's to come, and the Christmas 2019 season is

601
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,040
bringing something promising—sold out flights.

602
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:33,020
The holidays are by far the most popular season for travel to St Helena and with that, in

603
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:37,360
the months of December, January, and February, AirLink has added Tuesday flights from Cape

604
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,140
Down—a first for the island.

605
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:45,180
In addition, there's another promising sign—in their first year of operation, the flights

606
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,220
actually turned a small profit for AirLink.

607
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,300
Longer term, the island has ambitions for an even more extensive network of flights.

608
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,140
One goal would be to get a route to a South American city like Kissifi to allow for a

609
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,660
more direct route from the Americas.

610
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,340
Technically, this would be feasible as it's only a four-hour flight.

611
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,120
Commercially, though, that's another question.

612
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,380
Also on the wishlist is a round-trip flight to Namibia to tap into their large tourism

613
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,380
market.

614
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,540
However, the largest tourist demographic for the island by far is British and so the crown

615
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,940
jewel of routes would be to the UK.

616
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:26,600
Since before the airport even opened, there's been talk of a route to London via Cape Verde.

617
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,720
Right now, though, these are all just dreams.

618
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,620
An airline would only take the enormous risk of starting a route to St Helena if it proved

619
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:38,240
not only commercially viable, but successful.

620
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,940
That has not happened yet.

621
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,940
The next couple years for St Helena are crucial.

622
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,140
As the number of successful completed flights ticks up, data will prove whether they're

623
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,620
sticking to this line—the line that will determine whether St Helena will survive economically

624
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,580
into the far future.

625
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:01,020
If they stick to it, they're in for an economic renaissance.

626
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:05,460
If they start to fall below it, there's little hope for any sort of self-sufficiency

627
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,980
meaning the island will remain at the mercy of the UK's budgetary allocations.

628
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,300
St Helena was never supposed to change overnight, and the airport was never supposed to be a

629
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,180
magic cure-all.

630
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,460
The airport is a tool for change, not the impetus of change itself.

631
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,580
For the island to fundamentally change, it has to sell itself to the world.

632
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,260
It has to one by one convince people to come to it, to invest in it, to take a risk on

633
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,460
a place that's competing with an entire world of options.

634
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:42,240
Time has proven that St Helena airport is not the world's most useless airport.

635
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,060
It has rather proven that it has the potential to become the world's most useful airport—an

636
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:52,460
airport that could save lives, revitalize an economy, and connect a forgotten dot on

637
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,320
the map to the rest of it.

638
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:58,660
An airport that could rescue an island from falling into the same fate of so many like

639
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:03,980
it—crumbling into irrelevance as its people are slowly drawn to the urban world.

640
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:18,180
So now that the island has their tool, all they have to do is use it.

641
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:24,540
As I mentioned at the start, this entire project was made possible thanks to CuriosityStream.

642
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,740
They covered all the enormous production expenses, including flying a team to St Helena,

643
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,280
and all they asked in return was for us to mention the bundle deal they're running

644
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,880
with Nebula, the streaming site founded by myself and loads of other great creators,

645
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,420
and where this documentary originally released.

646
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:47,020
