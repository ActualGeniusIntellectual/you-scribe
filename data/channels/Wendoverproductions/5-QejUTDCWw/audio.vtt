00:00.000 --> 00:06.080
What you're about to watch is a Nebula original, meaning it was first released on Nebula—the

00:06.080 --> 00:09.520
streaming site founded by myself and plenty of other creators.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.680
Producing this documentary was an enormous project which involved flying myself and a

00:13.680 --> 00:19.560
crew 10,000 miles to one of the most remote places on earth, and it was entirely funded

00:19.560 --> 00:20.840
by CuriosityStream.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.520
That's because CuriosityStream has partnered with Nebula to offer a bundle deal where,

00:25.520 --> 00:30.640
if you sign up at curiositystream.com slash wendover, you also get a Nebula subscription.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.080
Easy as that.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.000
On there you'll find loads of other great originals by independent creators, but for

00:36.000 --> 00:52.040
now to the documentary.

01:06.000 --> 01:24.600
It was this precise moment, early on a Saturday afternoon in October, 2017, that changed the

01:24.600 --> 01:29.060
course of history for one of the world's most remote societies.

01:29.060 --> 01:34.360
This moment that ended 500 years of isolation from the world, cutting travel time to there

01:34.360 --> 01:38.320
from six days on a boat to six hours on a plane.

01:38.320 --> 01:43.440
It was this small moment that changed everything for the island—an island where the thing

01:43.440 --> 01:47.320
they need most of all, as much as it might hurt, is change.

01:47.320 --> 01:52.120
It was this moment that, long in the future, will be recognized as the single most consequential

01:52.120 --> 01:55.240
ever for the island of St Helena.

01:55.240 --> 02:00.200
You'd be forgiven for not knowing exactly what or where St Helena is.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.320
It's not a place that one hears a whole lot about.

02:03.320 --> 02:06.120
If you have heard of it, that's likely thanks to Napoleon.

02:06.120 --> 02:11.040
It's here, on St Helena, where the infamous emperor of France was exiled by the British

02:11.040 --> 02:13.960
for the six years preceding his death.

02:13.960 --> 02:16.840
Since then, though, the island has been up to quite a bit.

02:16.840 --> 02:21.400
It's now home to about 4,500 of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.

02:21.400 --> 02:25.660
Walking a block through its capital of Jamestown, it's tough to go without saying hi and hello

02:25.660 --> 02:27.440
a half dozen times.

02:27.440 --> 02:31.760
Driving past someone without giving a wave, well, that's practically a crime.

02:31.760 --> 02:35.760
Saints, as the residents are called, are as proudly British as they come and fly their

02:35.760 --> 02:39.140
Union Jacks copiously and conspicuously.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.920
The island is, after all, a British overseas territory.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.800
Life on St Helena is quite unlike life in the UK, though.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.180
They've got their own money, their own accent, their own culture, their own government, but

02:50.180 --> 02:55.360
most of all, what makes life on St Helena different is where it is.

02:55.360 --> 02:59.040
The island sits in the same neighborhood as nothing.

02:59.040 --> 03:02.960
London, Africa is 1,100 miles or 1,800 kilometers to its east.

03:02.960 --> 03:08.560
Mainland South America is about 2,000 miles or 3,300 kilometers to its west.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.400
London is over 4,600 miles or 7,500 kilometers to its north.

03:13.400 --> 03:20.100
St Helena's isolation defines and shapes it in absolutely every way—including, perhaps

03:20.100 --> 03:23.040
most consequentially, economically.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.600
You see, St Helena is not a wealthy place.

03:26.600 --> 03:32.860
Its GDP per capita averages just above $12,000 compared to about $40,000 in the UK.

03:32.860 --> 03:37.440
The issue is that getting people and things to and from the middle of nowhere costs a

03:37.440 --> 03:41.580
great deal, so there just aren't too many industries that can profitably operate on

03:41.580 --> 03:45.020
a place as tiny and isolated as St Helena.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.360
The Saints have found a few, though.

03:47.360 --> 03:51.560
Beyond the traditional goods and services sectors that any small community would have,

03:51.560 --> 03:54.120
St Helena does have exports.

03:54.120 --> 04:00.120
Coffee, we have some of the rarest coffee in the world, which sells for, I know, 90

04:00.120 --> 04:04.280
to 100 pounds in the United Kingdom for just 100 grams.

04:04.280 --> 04:09.140
If we could increase that to some extent, that would bring revenue to many of the farmers

04:09.140 --> 04:10.140
on the island.

04:10.140 --> 04:15.340
They also sell a good amount of tuna and honey, but then there's another sector that capitalizes

04:15.340 --> 04:17.120
on the island's isolation.

04:17.120 --> 04:25.920
The predominant economy here at the moment is niche tourism—diving, history, natural

04:25.920 --> 04:31.720
history—walking tours, bird watching, those sorts of things, plus also a growing market

04:31.720 --> 04:36.680
of people who want to get away from it all, are one week away from the internet, and given

04:36.680 --> 04:40.680
the internet prices here, that's quite easy to achieve if you want to do it.

04:40.680 --> 04:46.040
But tourism would be nothing without a means to get off and on to St Helena Island.

04:46.040 --> 04:49.980
It was only recently that this became something the government had to worry about.

04:49.980 --> 04:54.240
In the early days of the island's human history, shipping was what brought a population

04:54.240 --> 04:55.960
to it.

04:55.960 --> 04:59.880
It was the perfect stopping point on the route from the Far East to Europe around the Cape

04:59.880 --> 05:04.640
of Good Hope—so perfect, in fact, that if for a while, the entire island was run by

05:04.640 --> 05:07.120
the British East India Company.

05:07.120 --> 05:11.220
Eventually though, the Suez Canal opened and so fewer boats would round the southern tip

05:11.220 --> 05:12.220
of Africa.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.780
This, of course, diminished St Helena's importance, but still, up until the 1970s,

05:17.780 --> 05:21.900
the island served as a regular stopping point for ocean liners traveling between the UK

05:21.900 --> 05:25.980
and South Africa, meaning there was a reliable link to the outside world.

05:25.980 --> 05:31.540
But then, throughout the 20th century, as air travel grew more popular and profitable,

05:31.540 --> 05:36.000
passenger ocean liners around the world increasingly struggled to fill their ships, and one by

05:36.000 --> 05:38.620
one closed down.

05:38.620 --> 05:43.900
The last shipping line, with passenger service to St Helena, collapsed in 1977, leaving the

05:43.900 --> 05:47.720
island marooned—with no way to get to the outside world.

05:47.720 --> 05:51.380
The British stepped in, buying a ship for their overseas territory, which would be called

05:51.380 --> 05:53.620
the RMS St Helena.

05:53.620 --> 05:57.060
The RMS was part cargo ship, part passenger ship.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.900
In the front, she carried dozens of shipping containers, acting as the primary supply line

06:00.900 --> 06:06.500
for the island, and in the back, she was adorned with pools and bars and sun loungers.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.580
Her regular journey consisted of the five nights from Cape Town to St Helena, then she

06:10.580 --> 06:14.320
would continue on to Ascension Island in two or three nights, where she would meet and

06:14.320 --> 06:19.060
connect her passengers to one of the bi-weekly Royal Air Force flights to the UK.

06:19.060 --> 06:24.540
This method, via Ascension, allowed travelers to get from the UK to St Helena in relative

06:24.540 --> 06:27.180
speed—just four days.

06:27.180 --> 06:30.380
Most though, took the longer route from South Africa.

06:30.380 --> 06:33.940
Locals and tourists alike adored the RMS.

06:33.940 --> 06:38.660
She was thought of as the perfect transition from St Helena to the outside world or vice

06:38.660 --> 06:39.660
versa.

06:39.660 --> 06:44.820
She was a legendary, storied vessel, but after decades of heavy use shuttling passengers

06:44.820 --> 06:50.500
to and from the island, in the early 2000s, the RMS was getting old and worn and the government

06:50.500 --> 06:53.460
started to think about what would replace her.

06:53.460 --> 06:58.820
Initial assessments found that replacing the ship would cost up to $100 million.

06:58.820 --> 07:04.120
This led to the question—with that kind of money, was a ship really the best option?

07:04.120 --> 07:07.740
The answer, it turned out, was probably not.

07:07.740 --> 07:13.420
After decades of feasibility studies, discussions, debates, false starts, delays, and bidding,

07:13.420 --> 07:19.180
a contract was produced and with a few quick signatures, life on St Helena would change

07:19.180 --> 07:20.180
forever.

07:20.180 --> 07:22.620
St Helena was getting an airport.

07:22.940 --> 07:28.700
The contract was signed in November 2011 and that's when Basil Reid arrived on the island

07:28.700 --> 07:32.360
to start basically looking at the infrastructure logistics.

07:32.360 --> 07:38.780
They started the first construction or the first moving of soil in 2015 November and

07:38.780 --> 07:42.180
obviously they built various roads up to the airport because they had to get the logistics

07:42.180 --> 07:43.180
up to the airport.

07:43.180 --> 07:52.340
They also had a ship that brought in all the materials, logistics, all the space, equipment

07:52.340 --> 07:55.180
that had to obviously help to build the airport.

07:55.180 --> 08:00.560
So they constructed it over four years at the end of 2050.

08:00.560 --> 08:05.900
The runway was completed, most of the terminal buildings were completed, most of the CNS

08:05.900 --> 08:10.620
equipment, which is communication and navigation equipment, was installed and the airport was

08:10.620 --> 08:15.600
ready for a certification at the end of October 2015.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.500
New airports are rare.

08:17.500 --> 08:22.260
New airports in places that have never had an airport before are even rarer.

08:22.260 --> 08:27.200
Getting an empty husk of an airport, certified and staffed, is no easy task.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.900
For this to happen on St Helena, subcontractors were streaming through the island.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.620
There were audits upon audits upon audits.

08:33.620 --> 08:35.160
Staff members were recruited.

08:35.160 --> 08:38.600
Locals were trained both on and off island for jobs like security, immigration, firefighting

08:38.600 --> 08:39.700
and more.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.100
Emergency procedures were written, public meetings were conducted, airport vehicles

08:43.100 --> 08:47.540
were shipped in, instruments were calibrated, beacons and localizers and obstacle lights

08:47.540 --> 08:53.020
were installed, a logo was designed, calibration flights came in, emergency drills were conducted,

08:53.020 --> 08:58.620
drone mods were codified, operational trials were run, and then finally, in February 2016,

08:58.620 --> 09:01.820
the airport was certified and ready to open.

09:01.820 --> 09:06.500
Commercial flights could start, and St Helena would achieve its decades-long ambition of

09:06.500 --> 09:10.060
having an air link to the outside world.

09:10.060 --> 09:12.360
There was just one more step.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.980
As one last hurdle of bureaucracy, Comair, the airline contracted to operate flights

09:16.980 --> 09:21.780
to St Helena, wanted to perform an implementation flight, as they called it.

09:21.780 --> 09:25.980
Essentially, they were going to fly one of their planes in to test that everything, from

09:25.980 --> 09:29.820
the instruments to the runway to the terminal to the fuel system, worked.

09:29.820 --> 09:34.500
Now, Comair was really the perfect airline to connect St Helena to the world.

09:34.500 --> 09:39.260
They're a British Airways franchisee, meaning they are contracted by British Airways to

09:39.260 --> 09:43.660
operate their regional flights from South Africa and therefore fly a number of routes

09:43.660 --> 09:46.640
around the region under the British Airways brand.

09:46.640 --> 09:51.440
The plan was for Comair to operate a British Airways route non-stop from Johannesburg to

09:51.440 --> 09:52.660
St Helena.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.840
These flights would seamlessly connect to other British Airways flights to the two locations

09:56.840 --> 10:02.460
Saints travel most—Capetown and London—as well as with hundreds of other destinations

10:02.460 --> 10:03.820
around the world.

10:03.820 --> 10:07.700
With the exception of a direct flight to the UK, there's really nothing better St Helena

10:07.700 --> 10:09.620
Airport could have wished for.

10:09.620 --> 10:12.480
They just had to do the implementation flight.

10:12.480 --> 10:19.120
So, on one sunny, nearly cloudless April day in 2016, a Comair 737 appeared off in

10:19.120 --> 10:23.160
the distance to the north of St Helena Airport carrying a handful of staff members of the

10:23.160 --> 10:25.820
airline and airport construction company.

10:25.820 --> 10:30.980
It approached, wheels up, in order to perform a flyby above the runway, as planned.

10:30.980 --> 10:35.360
After gaining altitude again, it circled back around in order to make a second and final

10:35.360 --> 10:36.880
approach.

10:36.880 --> 10:43.060
But then, just seconds away from touchdown, there was a sort of wobble.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.480
Then another one.

10:44.480 --> 10:48.920
Then once its wheels were just feet above the runway, the pilots elected to abort the

10:48.920 --> 10:52.280
landing, go around, and give it another shot.

10:52.280 --> 10:57.960
So, the plane circled around again and, after some more wobbling, came to a landing—the

10:57.960 --> 11:02.600
first ever landing of a commercial passenger jet on the island, even if it wasn't carrying

11:02.600 --> 11:03.960
commercial passengers.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.840
St Helena was thrilled.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.000
I'm here with Basarites Island Director, Dejan Diake.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.280
Dejan, you just arrived on the first passenger jet to land here on St Helena.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.920
Can you describe the experience?

11:16.920 --> 11:18.920
Great experience.

11:18.920 --> 11:22.880
I mean, it's just a cherry on the cake after the four years work.

11:22.880 --> 11:28.480
Friday, Friday morning, I flew out on the AC flight, I went home, spent the weekend

11:28.480 --> 11:33.680
with the family, played golf yesterday, and today I'm back on the island.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.120
I mean, that's the signs of the times, eh?

11:36.120 --> 11:40.320
And that's the whole reason for the airport, is to be able to travel back and forth as

11:40.320 --> 11:41.440
you please.

11:41.440 --> 11:46.720
Susan Obey and Graham Vess, guys, you were here to witness the first ever passenger jet

11:46.720 --> 11:47.720
land on St Helena.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.080
First of all, you, Graham, how does it feel?

11:50.080 --> 11:52.520
Can you describe the experience?

11:52.520 --> 11:57.280
It was absolutely amazing and I feel really privileged to be here at this momentous occasion.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.680
It really is such a historic event.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.440
I feel absolutely wonderful.

12:01.440 --> 12:05.160
I feel proud of everything that's been done by you guys on the island.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.160
Thank you.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.160
And you, Susan?

12:08.160 --> 12:10.080
Excited, extremely excited.

12:10.080 --> 12:17.520
This is like the culmination of weeks, months, years of hard work, as far back as 2005, and

12:17.520 --> 12:21.760
we're really, really proud of everything that's been achieved today.

12:21.760 --> 12:26.340
This is the first step, you know, a plane landing on St Helena.

12:26.340 --> 12:28.520
What does this now mean for tourism on St Helena?

12:28.600 --> 12:31.560
Well, now we've got the gateway to get people here.

12:31.560 --> 12:34.740
Before we had to rely on the ship, the RMS coming backwards and forwards.

12:34.740 --> 12:36.280
This means we can have a steady stream.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.880
At first, it'll be that Saturday flight people will get used to, and then once that's

12:39.880 --> 12:43.400
been filling up, hopefully we'll have a midweek one, and that's the way we can really

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
develop tourism.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.880
And it becomes worth people investing in—restaurants, bars, other things that'll help the tourists

12:48.880 --> 12:49.880
here.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.120
So, the start of a new era for St Helena.

12:52.120 --> 12:58.600
Tourism was ecstatic, but at the time, nobody fully understood what had just happened.

12:58.600 --> 13:04.800
You see, this little wobble—just before landing—had just derailed the decades-long

13:04.800 --> 13:09.000
plan for St Helena's new era.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.320
That wobble was evidence of wind shear—a phenomenon where wind traveling in one direction

13:14.320 --> 13:19.660
meets wind traveling in another direction and creates a zone of turbulent air.

13:19.660 --> 13:23.680
In St Helena's case, its wind shear was due to the already strong wind being pushed

13:23.680 --> 13:28.340
around and rerouted by the enormous cliffs at the northern end of its runway.

13:28.340 --> 13:33.500
When coming in to land an airplane, wind is already a hassle, but when it quickly shifts,

13:33.500 --> 13:38.500
as in the case of wind shear, it can be a lot worse.

13:38.500 --> 13:42.060
The first sign to the general public that something was wrong was when the St Helena

13:42.060 --> 13:46.180
government postponed the long-scheduled airport opening ceremony, which was planned to be

13:46.180 --> 13:48.460
presided upon by Prince Andrew.

13:48.540 --> 13:52.900
Eventually, it emerged that the solution would be to land planes from the south, as there

13:52.900 --> 13:58.840
was not a wind shear issue from this direction, but this did have its own issues.

13:58.840 --> 14:02.980
Planes generally like to land into the wind, as this allows them to stop faster on the

14:02.980 --> 14:07.740
runway, but at the airport, wind almost always comes from the south, meaning planes would

14:07.740 --> 14:09.780
be landing with a tailwind.

14:09.780 --> 14:14.740
In order to successfully land a 737 with a tailwind on the length of runway offered at

14:14.740 --> 14:19.220
St Helena, the 737 would have to be quite light.

14:19.220 --> 14:23.020
It wouldn't be able to take its full capacity of passengers or cargo.

14:23.020 --> 14:27.520
In fact, it would have to shed so much weight that the flight would never be commercially

14:27.520 --> 14:33.160
profitable for Comair, even with the planned subsidies, and so, unceremoniously, it was

14:33.160 --> 14:38.020
announced that Comair, and therefore British Airways, would not be running the flights

14:38.020 --> 14:39.620
to St Helena.

14:39.620 --> 14:43.740
Eventually, the story of St Helena Airport reached the world.

14:43.740 --> 14:47.300
The British tabloids got their hands on it and ripped it to shreds.

14:47.300 --> 14:54.060
They called the airport embarrassing—a gaffe, a folly, a farcical vanity project.

14:54.060 --> 14:57.100
Much of what was reported wasn't even accurate.

14:57.100 --> 15:01.020
Tabloids said it was impossible to land, they said the airport was closed, neither of which

15:01.020 --> 15:02.160
was true.

15:02.160 --> 15:06.420
In fact, throughout the delay, private and medevac flights were coming in and out with

15:06.420 --> 15:07.540
no problem.

15:07.540 --> 15:12.500
The media latched on to the video of that Comair implementation flight and, as one outlet

15:12.500 --> 15:16.220
called it, the terrifying three attempts it took to land.

15:16.220 --> 15:21.860
In reality, it was one planned flyby, one aborted landing, and one successful landing.

15:21.860 --> 15:26.320
In the world of commercial aviation, aborted landings are nothing exceptional.

15:26.320 --> 15:31.180
They happen many times a day at airports large and small all around the world.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.940
Most of all, though, the common thread between all the media reports was the nickname St

15:35.940 --> 15:41.860
Helena Airport received—the world's most useless airport.

15:41.860 --> 15:43.660
That was the one that stunned.

15:43.660 --> 15:49.920
And I think a lot of the sort of initial label given by the popular media has not helped

15:49.920 --> 15:52.700
the island, and I think it's totally false, quite frankly.

15:52.700 --> 15:57.480
We knew that St. Helena was going to get a lot of flak over it from the media.

15:57.480 --> 16:05.180
We didn't quite appreciate how much it was going to feature, but it became a lot about

16:05.180 --> 16:09.280
how bad the British government had done in investing in the airport on St. Helena and

16:09.280 --> 16:11.300
putting it in the wrong place, essentially.

16:11.300 --> 16:17.140
When the bad press hit of St. Helena having a white elephant for an airport, I was really

16:17.140 --> 16:18.260
angry.

16:18.260 --> 16:24.140
And still today, in my professional capacity, we are countering and battling to get rid

16:24.140 --> 16:26.900
of that negativity.

16:26.900 --> 16:32.060
It is really bad, and people don't want to see the good that is actually happening.

16:32.060 --> 16:39.700
Since all of those articles, we've had to spend a lot of time, I suppose, trying to

16:39.700 --> 16:45.020
sell the island for its positive aspects, and also show things like there's only been

16:45.020 --> 16:49.580
one cancellation in the entire year this year, but those things are harder to get through

16:49.580 --> 16:52.140
than the sensationalist stuff that sells papers.

16:52.140 --> 16:55.820
You always have start and end problems, and what would you expect?

16:55.820 --> 16:58.980
We are in the middle of the South Atlantic.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.700
This is the first time for it to happen.

17:00.700 --> 17:05.020
So you've got to have trial and error, and I wish people would just leave the error now

17:05.020 --> 17:08.940
aside and look at what is happening as a result.

17:08.940 --> 17:13.220
In order to shrug off that nickname, they needed, of course, a flight.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.460
So we had to do a lot of research.

17:15.460 --> 17:20.700
So we commissioned our UK Met office to do a lot of research on our wind data.

17:20.700 --> 17:25.380
So we collated a lot of wind data over six months, twelve months, so we could ascertain

17:25.380 --> 17:29.700
exactly what the conditions were on runway 20 and runway 02.

17:29.700 --> 17:35.420
Once we got all that data into place, then the SHG government went out with a new tender,

17:35.420 --> 17:40.260
looking for an aircraft that could actually land runway 02, which had a 15 knot tailwind

17:40.260 --> 17:41.260
component.

17:41.260 --> 17:45.580
It was runway 20 that had the wind shear issue, not runway 02.

17:45.580 --> 17:50.260
These two are, in fact, the same physical runway, but runway 20 refers to the landing

17:50.260 --> 17:54.540
coming from the north, runway 02 refers to the landing from the south.

17:54.540 --> 17:59.180
The prevailing winds originate from the south, so the key to a safe landing was an aircraft

17:59.180 --> 18:04.220
small enough to stop safely within the length of the runway even when wind pushes it from

18:04.220 --> 18:05.220
behind.

18:05.420 --> 18:10.660
That way, if the wind shear from the north is too bad, it can land from the south.

18:10.660 --> 18:13.660
The service was not to be subsidized, but rather underwritten.

18:13.660 --> 18:20.660
There isn't a subsidy per passenger, so they don't get paid, let's say, ten pounds

18:20.660 --> 18:22.940
per passenger per flight at all.

18:22.940 --> 18:28.700
It's very much a commercial service, but if that commercial service makes a loss, that

18:28.700 --> 18:33.620
loss is underwritten by DFID in the UK.

18:33.620 --> 18:37.480
Two main bidders emerged to operate the flights to St Helena.

18:37.480 --> 18:41.980
The first was a company called Atlantic Star Airlines.

18:41.980 --> 18:46.660
Founded in 2012, still the early days of the airport construction process, Atlantic Star

18:46.660 --> 18:51.340
was created specifically to serve as an airline for St Helena.

18:51.340 --> 18:55.580
Their original plan was to make weekly flights directly from London to St Helena via some

18:55.580 --> 18:59.500
midway refueling stop in addition to a weekly flight to Cape Town.

18:59.500 --> 19:03.020
It was an ambitious plan, but they were serious about it.

19:03.020 --> 19:07.420
The company consisted of seasoned aviation executives and professionals including a CEO

19:07.420 --> 19:09.660
who came from British Airways.

19:09.660 --> 19:13.360
Over time, though, the plan was scaled back to operating a few charter flights a year

19:13.360 --> 19:16.860
from London to St Helena via Banjul in the Gambia.

19:16.860 --> 19:18.860
This was going to happen.

19:18.860 --> 19:23.540
They had an agreement with TUI Airlines to charter A737, they had announced schedules,

19:23.540 --> 19:28.460
they had set fares, but then, of course, the airport's opening was delayed, and these

19:28.460 --> 19:32.160
flights were all cancelled.

19:32.160 --> 19:36.880
After some time, in October 2016, Atlantic Star came back into the story by chartering

19:36.880 --> 19:42.280
an Avro RJ1000 to fly to the island and run a series of test landings—a move the company

19:42.280 --> 19:46.160
tried to use as evidence of their legitimacy in the bidding process.

19:46.160 --> 19:50.920
The proposal was that they would lease an Avro jet to be based on St Helena as the island's

19:50.920 --> 19:52.620
dedicated aircraft.

19:52.620 --> 19:56.200
Twice a week, they would fly the hour and a half north to Ascension Island to connect

19:56.200 --> 19:59.400
with the bi-weekly RAF flights to the UK.

19:59.400 --> 20:04.000
Having the aircraft based on St Helena would, according to their bid, be quite the benefit

20:04.000 --> 20:08.360
for the island considering that it could, at a moment's notice, fly medical evacuation

20:08.360 --> 20:11.980
flights, rather than waiting for a plane to fly in from South Africa to pick a patient

20:11.980 --> 20:12.980
up.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.280
Ultimately, though, the bid failed.

20:15.280 --> 20:19.720
The other major bid submitted to the St Helena government was by a South African airline

20:19.720 --> 20:21.680
called Airlink.

20:21.680 --> 20:27.360
Their plan was to fly an Embraer E190 jet to St Helena once weekly on Saturdays.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.960
The aircraft would fly from Johannesburg to Windhoek, Namibia where it would meet another

20:30.960 --> 20:33.020
service coming in from Cape Town.

20:33.020 --> 20:37.480
This connecting structure was viewed as quite important since, while most of the St Diaspora

20:37.480 --> 20:42.440
is in Cape Town, Johannesburg is the larger airport and offers more connections.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.880
From Windhoek, it would then fly the three hours over the South Atlantic to land in St

20:46.880 --> 20:47.960
Helena.

20:47.960 --> 20:50.340
It would then do the same in reverse.

20:50.340 --> 20:54.320
Included in Airlink's bid was an agreement to operate once monthly charter flights from

20:54.320 --> 20:58.620
St Helena to Ascension Island as an add-on to their flight from Johannesburg, giving

20:58.620 --> 21:03.220
that island, which primarily serves as a military base for the UK and US, its only regularly

21:03.220 --> 21:06.580
scheduled non-military flight to the outside world.

21:06.580 --> 21:10.560
This bid was as close to perfect St Helena was going to get.

21:10.560 --> 21:15.760
On July 21, 2017, the St Helena government signed a contract with Airlink and announced

21:15.760 --> 21:20.200
to the world that this tiny South Atlantic outpost was finally getting its connection

21:20.200 --> 21:21.200
to the world.

21:21.620 --> 21:25.180
St Helena was getting a flight—for real this time.

21:25.180 --> 21:29.640
A few months later, just over a year after that Comair flight had arrived in the skies

21:29.640 --> 21:34.000
above St Helena, an Airlink in Rhear E190 did the same.

21:34.000 --> 21:38.900
It was filled with 70 or so journalists, tourists, and saints, and soon enough, safely touched

21:38.900 --> 21:43.740
down and was greeted by, well, a big proportion of St Helena.

21:43.740 --> 21:47.080
That was St Helena's before and after moment.

21:47.080 --> 21:52.460
Once those wheels touched down, St Helena would never be the same.

21:52.460 --> 21:57.180
But once that happened, once the honeymoon period was over, it was time for St Helena

21:57.180 --> 21:59.340
to get to work.

21:59.340 --> 22:03.300
Realizing the full potential of the airport was no easy task.

22:03.300 --> 22:07.420
Of course the natural environment presented its own issues, but the true challenge lies

22:07.420 --> 22:11.600
in the island's geographic isolation and political independence which mean that, in

22:11.600 --> 22:15.300
all aspects, the airport has to be entirely self-sufficient.

22:16.000 --> 22:20.600
They're not run by some big company, they're not part of any national system.

22:20.600 --> 22:26.800
St Helena Airport is run by St Helena Airport Limited and, if Gwyneth Howell, its CEO, doesn't

22:26.800 --> 22:30.660
know what to do, there's not really anyone she can call.

22:30.660 --> 22:35.360
That means that everything needed to run St Helena Airport, from administrative to operational,

22:35.360 --> 22:38.600
has to happen at St Helena Airport.

22:38.600 --> 22:43.160
It turns out that, even with just one weekly flight, that's quite a lot.

22:43.540 --> 22:49.120
What we have is, for example, in this room here, we have what's called CNS, so Communications,

22:49.120 --> 22:51.060
Navigations and Surveillance.

22:51.060 --> 22:55.500
We have two guys, one who works on IT side of things, one who works on the navigation

22:55.500 --> 22:57.420
aids and so on.

22:57.420 --> 23:00.660
They're really crucial to the running of the airport.

23:00.660 --> 23:06.420
Without the Communications, Navigations system, without those IT systems in place, we wouldn't

23:06.420 --> 23:11.460
be able to land aircraft and take off aircraft here at the airport.

23:11.460 --> 23:13.320
That's extremely important.

23:13.320 --> 23:19.840
CEO's office, obviously we need a Chief Executive Officer for St Helena Airport Limited and

23:19.840 --> 23:21.480
then there's my office next door.

23:21.480 --> 23:28.880
I'm kind of the CEO's right-hand person, so I will always be there to support them, but

23:28.880 --> 23:33.720
I'm also kind of separate as well, because I'm meant to be there to be the conscience

23:33.720 --> 23:40.120
almost of the company, to do the thinking, to do the questioning, why are we doing it

23:40.120 --> 23:41.120
like that?

23:41.260 --> 23:42.260
Could we do it another way?

23:42.260 --> 23:43.260
Could we do it a safer way?

23:43.260 --> 23:44.260
Could we do it a better way?

23:44.260 --> 23:47.220
So that's a pretty important role.

23:47.220 --> 23:52.360
So if we carry on this way, actually, this is an important room to look in.

23:52.360 --> 23:58.880
It's the gym and it's where our RFS team keep fit.

23:58.880 --> 24:05.060
Being in the Firefighting Service, it's a very physical job, so you need to be fit all

24:05.060 --> 24:06.060
the time.

24:06.060 --> 24:10.660
In fact, there are fitness levels to be met, so the gym is an important part of that.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.200
Hello, Bill.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.200
Hello.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.200
Security.

24:14.200 --> 24:19.400
Because I'm not security cleared, I can't go in there, even though I'm sort of senior

24:19.400 --> 24:20.400
management team.

24:20.400 --> 24:26.640
There are still levels of security that some of us can't get into, and this is one room

24:26.640 --> 24:29.280
that I'm not permitted to go into, and rightly so.

24:29.280 --> 24:36.320
So if you want to follow me down in the rest of the combined building, so we have a training

24:36.320 --> 24:40.060
room, so there's an awful lot of training that goes on for staff.

24:40.060 --> 24:44.740
We need to be accredited in many respects, so there's a lot of training that goes on

24:44.740 --> 24:48.660
security in particular, but also firefighting as well.

24:48.660 --> 24:53.100
So that's our training room.

24:53.100 --> 25:03.620
Walking on further down, we also have a maintenance bay as well, which I'll briefly open the door,

25:03.620 --> 25:04.620
and walk in.

25:05.320 --> 25:10.800
The maintenance bay is where we obviously maintain equipment, and we have a lot of equipment

25:10.800 --> 25:15.520
to maintain, and we have an on-site mechanic who does so.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.960
So we also use it for storage as well.

25:17.960 --> 25:28.280
So this, for example, is a tow barless tug, allows us to tow aircraft if we need to, and

25:28.280 --> 25:32.980
other bits and pieces like the toilet cart and so on.

25:32.980 --> 25:39.200
So it's a multi-purpose bay, we use it for storage and we use it for maintaining our

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
vehicles.

25:40.200 --> 25:49.780
So if we're moving along, finally come to the end, and it's the most important room

25:49.780 --> 25:53.960
in the building because these people make sure we get paid.

25:53.960 --> 26:02.120
So here we have, good afternoon, we have HR and Finance.

26:02.120 --> 26:10.080
Really important to running a small but compact airport.

26:10.080 --> 26:15.500
But nevertheless, there's all the HR and financial functions that go with that.

26:15.500 --> 26:19.580
In addition to all the administrative functions, St Helena airport, while it might need less

26:19.580 --> 26:24.440
of it, needs all the same things that an enormous airport like Heathrow would need.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.300
A striking example of this is the fire service.

26:27.300 --> 26:31.740
ICAO regulation basically states that every airport has to have some sort of firefighter

26:31.740 --> 26:32.740
category.

26:32.740 --> 26:37.680
It really depends on the movement of the aircraft within that airfield.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.080
That's regulation and that is what we have to provide.

26:41.080 --> 26:45.440
We are always on standby, so if there's an aircraft emergency right now and we get

26:45.440 --> 26:50.040
the crash alarms go, we can provide a three-minute response to the runway.

26:50.040 --> 26:54.360
That's despite the fact that most days, there isn't a single aircraft within hundreds

26:54.360 --> 26:59.700
of miles of the island, but nonetheless, it's what's required by regulation.

26:59.700 --> 27:03.800
Even at an airport with thousands of weekly flights, it's not as if firefighters are

27:03.800 --> 27:07.920
responding to fires all that often, which means that there's no real reason for those

27:07.920 --> 27:10.980
airports to have more than one firefighting crew.

27:10.980 --> 27:14.840
The result is that an airport like St Helena, which has one or two commercial flights a

27:14.840 --> 27:19.200
week, needs firefighting capabilities pretty similar to an airport like Heathrow, which

27:19.200 --> 27:20.200
has thousands.

27:20.200 --> 27:25.160
That's part of what balloons the cost of running such a small airport.

27:25.160 --> 27:29.500
Given the isolation of the island, weather forecasting is another crucially important

27:29.500 --> 27:34.460
yet challenging part of what's needed to keep the weekly flight reliable and safe.

27:34.460 --> 27:39.860
The UK Met Office stations meteorologists on St Helena on more or less yearly rotations.

27:39.860 --> 27:43.860
After a Saturday flight, I usually have the Sunday and Monday off, so when I come in on

27:43.860 --> 27:47.420
Tuesday, that's when I first start looking at what the weather's going to be like for

27:47.420 --> 27:50.500
the next flight day, which is usually the Saturday.

27:50.500 --> 27:56.260
As we get nearer to the time, I start to do more detailed forecasts for the airline.

27:56.260 --> 28:03.700
So on a Friday, I produce a detailed forecast for their estimated time of arrival on Saturday.

28:03.700 --> 28:08.720
And then I come in at four o'clock on the Saturday morning and update that forecast

28:08.720 --> 28:13.960
and forward that to the flight operations.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.600
The reason this is so important is so that they know, when an aircraft is supposed to

28:17.600 --> 28:22.620
get to St Helena airport, it'll be able to land at St Helena airport.

28:22.620 --> 28:28.700
The main problem is because of the remoteness of the airfield, there are no nearby diversions,

28:28.700 --> 28:33.820
so they can't arrive here and spend two hours circling and then divert to a nearby

28:33.820 --> 28:34.920
airfield.

28:34.920 --> 28:40.120
If they come here, then they've got to be 99% convinced that they're going to be able

28:40.120 --> 28:41.520
to land.

28:41.520 --> 28:48.640
So I will be looking at cloud basin visibility as the major things that would stop them from

28:48.640 --> 28:51.180
landing at St Helena.

28:51.180 --> 28:57.320
The reason being, because of their restrictions, they have to be visual with the airfield before

28:57.320 --> 28:59.000
they can land.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.180
So if the cloud base is below 900 feet, then they won't be able to see the airfield before

29:04.180 --> 29:05.740
their decision hike.

29:05.740 --> 29:09.560
Assuming the airline has that required level of confidence that the flight will be able

29:09.560 --> 29:14.340
to successfully land at St Helena, AirLink will give it clearance to depart from Johannesburg

29:14.340 --> 29:16.400
at about 9 am local time.

29:16.400 --> 29:22.300
It'll then make the two-hour flight to Walvis Bay, Namibia—a more or less regular flight.

29:22.300 --> 29:27.160
At Walvis Bay, they'll refuel the aircraft's tanks, giving them about six hours of flying

29:27.160 --> 29:30.560
time, but also at this top, they'll have to once again decide whether they'll be

29:30.560 --> 29:32.900
able to land at St Helena.

29:32.900 --> 29:37.780
This time, the level of confidence has to be higher than it was even in Johannesburg,

29:37.780 --> 29:42.260
but assuming they are confident, the flight will take off, climb to altitude, and begin

29:42.260 --> 29:47.420
its three-hour ocean crossing—but the decisions still aren't over.

29:47.420 --> 29:51.420
Throughout this crossing, the airline will be continuously evaluating the conditions

29:51.420 --> 29:55.860
on the island to assure they'll be able to land and, if they believe they can't,

29:55.860 --> 29:58.620
they'll turn back for Namibia.

29:58.620 --> 30:03.180
Assuming they continue on, eventually, they will then approach the island, drop altitude,

30:03.180 --> 30:06.360
and connect by radio with the airport's air traffic controller.

30:06.360 --> 30:11.600
But then, even once there, if the cloud levels are too low or the wind is too strong, the

30:11.600 --> 30:14.240
plane still won't be able to land.

30:14.240 --> 30:19.080
So when they get here and they're not able on the first attempt to land, they will do

30:19.080 --> 30:25.800
a go-around, they will go into a holding pattern, and they will wait for a few minutes, based

30:25.800 --> 30:30.840
on what we have in terms of satellite image for the weather.

30:30.840 --> 30:34.560
It could be ten minutes, it could be five minutes, it could be as soon as they go around,

30:34.560 --> 30:39.700
when they come back they can see the runway, and then they'll be able to do a landing.

30:39.700 --> 30:45.180
So in the unlikely event that a successful landing cannot be completed, then the aircraft

30:45.180 --> 30:46.680
will have to divert.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.240
St Helena's closest diversion point is Ascension Island.

30:50.240 --> 30:55.040
It's about an hour and a half flight north, so this is likely where any flight would divert

30:55.040 --> 30:57.760
if landing at St Helena was not possible.

30:57.760 --> 31:01.400
There they have fuels and facilities so the air-link flight could give landing on St Helena

31:01.400 --> 31:03.480
another shot the day after.

31:03.480 --> 31:07.900
In the time that St Helena airport has been open, no commercial flight has ever failed

31:07.900 --> 31:10.000
landing and had to divert.

31:10.000 --> 31:15.780
In fact, in the first ten months of 2019, the airport didn't even have a single cancelled

31:15.780 --> 31:17.120
flight.

31:17.120 --> 31:22.680
Every Saturday, at about 1.15 pm, an air-link Embraer E190 has reliably pierced through

31:22.680 --> 31:27.520
the clouds above St Helena's airport, ready to drop off another load of eager tourists

31:27.520 --> 31:30.140
and wistful locals.

31:30.180 --> 31:33.620
The holidays at St Helena airport are an event.

31:33.620 --> 31:37.940
Despite its tiny size, people start arriving at the building three to four hours in advance

31:37.940 --> 31:38.940
of the flight.

31:38.940 --> 31:43.700
While the plane might only seat 96 people, every flight sees a crowd far larger as extended

31:43.700 --> 31:48.020
families of every saint arriving and leaving seem to show up.

31:48.020 --> 31:52.580
Just for the flight day, there opens a bank branch, a gift shop, a luggage wrapping business,

31:52.580 --> 31:54.800
a cafe, and a restaurant.

31:54.800 --> 31:58.260
Those not taking the flight will stand in the check-in hall, looking to see who's

31:58.260 --> 32:02.500
arriving, then make their way up to the restaurant once the passengers pass through security.

32:02.500 --> 32:07.480
Then, as the time draws near, everyone packs into the observation deck—far busier than

32:07.480 --> 32:11.900
that of any of the world's largest airports—and look to the left.

32:11.900 --> 32:16.660
It's reminiscent of sailors watching to be the first to see land, but in this case,

32:16.660 --> 32:21.420
it's saints trying to be the first to see their link to the outside world—a world

32:21.420 --> 32:24.820
that some of them have only seen through screens.

32:24.820 --> 32:30.400
They try to spot the small metal tube that represents the link between them and us.

32:30.400 --> 32:36.060
With patience, the time comes, and the Embraer E190 appears in St Helena's skies.

32:36.060 --> 32:40.460
It makes its approach, usually jostled around by the consistently inconsistent winds, then

32:40.460 --> 32:45.700
passes the daunting cliff at the end of the runway, then glides smoothly into touchdown.

32:45.700 --> 32:49.460
That's when the airport truly comes alive.

32:49.460 --> 32:53.660
Only 75 minutes sits between the scheduled landing time and the scheduled takeoff time

32:53.660 --> 32:58.740
each Saturday, so, as soon as the aircraft takes its right turn towards the apron, there

32:58.740 --> 33:02.300
begins a carefully choreographed dance.

33:02.300 --> 33:05.920
The aircraft is marshalled in, then first to approach are the air stairs followed by

33:05.920 --> 33:10.540
the ground power unit that gives energy to the aircraft when it sits powered down.

33:10.540 --> 33:14.140
While the cleaners approach the aircraft, the baggage compartment of the aircraft is

33:14.140 --> 33:19.460
opened, the fuel truck gets into position, and the first passengers start to disembark.

33:19.460 --> 33:23.980
With certain jobs only needing to happen once a week, quite a few staff at the airport

33:23.980 --> 33:25.460
work multiple jobs.

33:25.460 --> 33:29.120
The firefighters, for example, go straight from their truck, assuring that the aircraft

33:29.120 --> 33:31.620
has landed safely, to handling baggage.

33:31.620 --> 33:35.780
At the back of the aircraft, all the sewage from the lavatory has to be emptied and an

33:35.780 --> 33:40.020
ambulift is used to lift passengers with reduced mobility on and off.

33:40.020 --> 33:44.380
The pilots qualified to land at St Helena are among the most senior and experienced

33:44.380 --> 33:48.820
at AirLink which means there are fewer than ten pilots who work the route.

33:48.820 --> 33:53.560
Therefore, they visit the island on average about once a month but, since the aircraft

33:53.560 --> 33:59.000
only stays there for just over an hour, have never seen more of the island than the airport.

33:59.000 --> 34:02.860
During their time on the island, though, they'll perform a safety inspection of the plane and

34:02.860 --> 34:06.460
then, soon enough, it'll be time to load up.

34:06.460 --> 34:11.680
Boarding the 96 or fewer passengers doesn't take long and quickly, the door will close,

34:11.680 --> 34:14.780
the stairs will pull away, and the aircraft will taxi back to the runway.

34:14.780 --> 34:19.860
It will take a turn to the north, roll its way down to the end of the runway, turn around,

34:19.860 --> 34:24.180
then thunder down St Helena's spotlessly clean piece of pavement to take off on its

34:24.180 --> 34:28.300
four and a half hour trip back to Johannesburg.

34:28.300 --> 34:32.980
With that, the clock starts ticking again as the airport preps for its next 75 minutes

34:32.980 --> 34:37.740
in the spotlight and then everyone makes their way to their homes or hotels, starting their

34:37.740 --> 34:42.400
next week of isolation from the world.

34:42.400 --> 34:46.240
Of course the Saints love the airport while they're at it—while they're standing

34:46.240 --> 34:50.360
in the observation deck watching the plane fly off, destined for Johannesburg in a quick

34:50.360 --> 34:51.760
four and a half hours.

34:51.760 --> 34:55.560
For those that have lived their entire lives on St Helena, the prospect of getting to South

34:55.560 --> 34:59.560
Africa in a matter of hours still seems like magic.

34:59.560 --> 35:04.200
Once people go home, though, the question that comes up frequently in conversation is,

35:04.200 --> 35:05.200
was it worth it?

35:05.200 --> 35:12.160
2013 and 2014, when they were building the airport, was a big significant boom for St

35:12.160 --> 35:13.160
Helena.

35:13.160 --> 35:20.440
The amount of people that were in and out of the island, a lot of St Helenaians saw

35:20.440 --> 35:24.280
airplane for the first time in their life.

35:24.280 --> 35:30.560
The economy was actually thriving, so it was a buildup to what was the airport going to

35:30.560 --> 35:31.960
bring for St Helena.

35:31.960 --> 35:36.920
I would say people expected the airport to bring quite significant change.

35:36.920 --> 35:43.400
Now whether those expectations were reasonable is something that is perhaps debatable.

35:43.400 --> 35:48.560
The once a week flight is OK, but at the end of the day, if you bring in a plane which

35:48.560 --> 35:57.240
can carry potentially 90 passengers, that's not enough to be able to generate a significant

35:57.240 --> 35:59.600
increase in the footfall on St Helena.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.760
I think there's an expectation that the service perhaps isn't delivering what it

36:03.760 --> 36:12.160
should, but I think we also have to take into account the fact that we're still not trying—we're

36:12.160 --> 36:20.080
still a relatively untested market, both for tourists and also for potential investors.

36:20.080 --> 36:23.800
Looking at the graphs, the airport has had some effect.

36:23.800 --> 36:30.440
In the 12 months after its opening, 3,337 people arrived on the island by plane.

36:30.440 --> 36:35.840
That's compared to just 2,616 passengers who had arrived the previous 12 months on

36:35.840 --> 36:37.100
the RMS.

36:37.100 --> 36:43.320
In the airport's second year of operations, 4,188 passengers arrived via the airport,

36:43.320 --> 36:47.760
which certainly is a measurable improvement, although overall visitor arrivals to the island

36:47.760 --> 36:51.960
stayed about the same as there was a period of overlap between the start of flights and

36:51.960 --> 36:53.640
the end of the RMS service.

36:53.640 --> 36:58.440
It's tough to measure the true success of the airport yet, just two years into service,

36:58.440 --> 37:03.200
but what's sure is that there has been no tourism explosion.

37:03.200 --> 37:08.400
Flights are expensive, infrequent, and indirect for everyone but South Africans, and this

37:08.400 --> 37:12.120
has kept the island a niche destination.

37:12.120 --> 37:16.340
The island certainly had to hurry up and wait as, while the first flight might have been

37:16.340 --> 37:22.020
the impetus for change, it certainly didn't change everything overnight.

37:22.020 --> 37:26.780
Success for St Helena airport, however, cannot be measured solely by visitor numbers.

37:26.780 --> 37:32.820
It can also be measured in lives—the number of lives this solitary piece of pavement has

37:32.820 --> 37:33.820
saved.

37:33.820 --> 37:39.140
I was in my last trimester, feeling normal pregnancy up until the last when my blood

37:39.140 --> 37:41.380
pressure kind of spiked.

37:41.940 --> 37:49.580
So the concern was pretty clampsier, and they decided that I needed an emergency cesarean.

37:49.580 --> 37:58.700
So Eli was born about four weeks earlier than expected.

37:58.700 --> 38:11.220
He—we had him around half sex Wednesday evening, and he had a bit of a restless night,

38:11.740 --> 38:19.540
breathing wasn't so good, although that was to be expected because of the C-section.

38:19.540 --> 38:27.500
The next morning, the midwife came in, and she said no, breathing wasn't normal, and

38:27.500 --> 38:35.620
they decided to put him on the ventilator and have him assessed, so they did so many

38:35.620 --> 38:42.100
tests, and he had respiratory distress syndrome.

38:42.100 --> 38:52.100
And about, like, eleven-ish on Thursday night, Dr Kevin O'Brien and Helen Lawrence came

38:52.100 --> 39:00.140
in to our room to say that he would need to be medivaced.

39:00.180 --> 39:07.020
The RMS was on its last journey to the UK, so the first reaction was, how do we get him

39:07.020 --> 39:08.740
out?

39:08.740 --> 39:15.700
And then it was—we were told that they had already decided to get a medivac flight in.

39:15.700 --> 39:21.620
Two days after Eli was born, on a Friday afternoon, a small jet from a South African medical evacuation

39:21.620 --> 39:26.500
company touched down at St Helena airport, representing only the fourth arrival by a

39:26.500 --> 39:29.060
fixed-wing aircraft to the island.

39:29.060 --> 39:33.520
The team spent the afternoon evaluating Eli's condition and then early the following morning,

39:33.520 --> 39:37.740
him and his mother, Patrice, were transferred by ambulance to the airport and brought onto

39:37.740 --> 39:38.740
the jet.

39:38.740 --> 39:43.420
After a quick four hours crossing the South Atlantic, they touched down in Cape Town and

39:43.420 --> 39:48.860
by 2pm local time arrived at Vincent Pilati Hospital with all the facilities Eli needed,

39:48.860 --> 39:52.060
just about five hours after leaving the hospital in St Helena.

39:52.060 --> 39:58.020
If it wasn't for the airport, then I really thought that Eli would have made it.

39:58.020 --> 40:03.820
It would have been a long wait for the RMS to come down, like another month, and then

40:03.820 --> 40:05.500
the weeks travel to Cape Town.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.940
He probably wouldn't have made it waiting for the month for the ship to actually get

40:09.940 --> 40:10.940
there.

40:10.940 --> 40:17.860
So, you know, without the airport, I don't think Eli would have made it, would have survived.

40:17.860 --> 40:20.740
Today, Eli is a perfectly healthy young boy.

40:20.740 --> 40:27.020
He's one of the handful of saints who quite directly owe their lives to the airport.

40:27.020 --> 40:32.160
Construction is dangerous and St Helena's hospital just isn't equipped to handle advanced

40:32.160 --> 40:34.440
medical conditions.

40:34.440 --> 40:39.360
Before the airport, that medical risk just came with the territory and in some cases,

40:39.360 --> 40:45.460
survival was down to luck—the luck of where the RMS was on its voyage schedule.

40:45.460 --> 40:50.100
One can't easily argue against anything that saves lives, no matter the cost, but

40:50.100 --> 40:53.820
the truth is that, when the British government spent their hundreds of millions of dollars

40:53.820 --> 40:59.300
to build St Helena airport, they had more than the humanitarian benefits in mind.

40:59.300 --> 41:04.700
In the two years since its opening, the airport has brought change, but it has not yet fundamentally

41:04.700 --> 41:07.340
transformed what St Helena is.

41:07.340 --> 41:15.460
I think that the potential for the island is actually really quite strong and I think

41:15.460 --> 41:21.860
that, but I think as with all emerging destinations, it's going to take a while.

41:21.860 --> 41:27.020
What I think is worrying, though, is that for a lot of people, it's how long will

41:27.020 --> 41:28.740
that while be?

41:28.740 --> 41:33.800
Is it going to be five years, ten years, twenty years, nobody really knows?

41:33.800 --> 41:37.900
Long term, the airport's ambition is, of course, to grow the island's economy.

41:37.900 --> 41:42.180
The UK's Department for International Development conducted a business case for the airport

41:42.180 --> 41:47.880
way back in 2010 and developed a tourism growth estimate for St Helena based on how other

41:47.880 --> 41:51.880
similar islands fared in the industry after improving their access.

41:51.880 --> 41:57.900
This model, starting at about 1,000 tourists per year in 2016, projected growth to 30,000

41:57.900 --> 42:02.580
yearly tourists in 2042—a number that has been subject to intense scrutiny everywhere

42:02.580 --> 42:06.720
from the St Helena dinner table to the parliament of the United Kingdom.

42:06.720 --> 42:10.900
The data show, though, that accounting for the one-year delay in the airport's opening,

42:10.900 --> 42:15.660
current visitor arrivals are exactly on target for this growth.

42:15.660 --> 42:19.940
What that means is that the airport project is not doomed from the start.

42:19.940 --> 42:24.380
What will determine its success is what's to come, and the Christmas 2019 season is

42:24.380 --> 42:28.040
bringing something promising—sold out flights.

42:28.040 --> 42:33.020
The holidays are by far the most popular season for travel to St Helena and with that, in

42:33.020 --> 42:37.360
the months of December, January, and February, AirLink has added Tuesday flights from Cape

42:37.360 --> 42:40.140
Down—a first for the island.

42:40.140 --> 42:45.180
In addition, there's another promising sign—in their first year of operation, the flights

42:45.180 --> 42:49.220
actually turned a small profit for AirLink.

42:49.220 --> 42:54.300
Longer term, the island has ambitions for an even more extensive network of flights.

42:54.300 --> 42:58.140
One goal would be to get a route to a South American city like Kissifi to allow for a

42:58.140 --> 43:00.660
more direct route from the Americas.

43:00.660 --> 43:04.340
Technically, this would be feasible as it's only a four-hour flight.

43:04.340 --> 43:07.120
Commercially, though, that's another question.

43:07.120 --> 43:11.380
Also on the wishlist is a round-trip flight to Namibia to tap into their large tourism

43:11.380 --> 43:12.380
market.

43:12.380 --> 43:17.540
However, the largest tourist demographic for the island by far is British and so the crown

43:17.540 --> 43:20.940
jewel of routes would be to the UK.

43:20.940 --> 43:26.600
Since before the airport even opened, there's been talk of a route to London via Cape Verde.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.720
Right now, though, these are all just dreams.

43:29.720 --> 43:34.620
An airline would only take the enormous risk of starting a route to St Helena if it proved

43:34.620 --> 43:38.240
not only commercially viable, but successful.

43:38.240 --> 43:40.940
That has not happened yet.

43:40.940 --> 43:44.940
The next couple years for St Helena are crucial.

43:44.940 --> 43:49.140
As the number of successful completed flights ticks up, data will prove whether they're

43:49.140 --> 43:54.620
sticking to this line—the line that will determine whether St Helena will survive economically

43:54.620 --> 43:56.580
into the far future.

43:56.580 --> 44:01.020
If they stick to it, they're in for an economic renaissance.

44:01.020 --> 44:05.460
If they start to fall below it, there's little hope for any sort of self-sufficiency

44:05.460 --> 44:10.980
meaning the island will remain at the mercy of the UK's budgetary allocations.

44:10.980 --> 44:15.300
St Helena was never supposed to change overnight, and the airport was never supposed to be a

44:15.300 --> 44:17.180
magic cure-all.

44:17.180 --> 44:22.460
The airport is a tool for change, not the impetus of change itself.

44:22.460 --> 44:27.580
For the island to fundamentally change, it has to sell itself to the world.

44:27.580 --> 44:32.260
It has to one by one convince people to come to it, to invest in it, to take a risk on

44:32.260 --> 44:36.460
a place that's competing with an entire world of options.

44:36.460 --> 44:42.240
Time has proven that St Helena airport is not the world's most useless airport.

44:42.240 --> 44:48.060
It has rather proven that it has the potential to become the world's most useful airport—an

44:48.060 --> 44:52.460
airport that could save lives, revitalize an economy, and connect a forgotten dot on

44:52.460 --> 44:54.320
the map to the rest of it.

44:54.320 --> 44:58.660
An airport that could rescue an island from falling into the same fate of so many like

44:58.660 --> 45:03.980
it—crumbling into irrelevance as its people are slowly drawn to the urban world.

45:03.980 --> 45:18.180
So now that the island has their tool, all they have to do is use it.

45:18.180 --> 45:24.540
As I mentioned at the start, this entire project was made possible thanks to CuriosityStream.

45:24.540 --> 45:29.740
They covered all the enormous production expenses, including flying a team to St Helena,

45:29.740 --> 45:33.280
and all they asked in return was for us to mention the bundle deal they're running

45:33.280 --> 45:37.880
with Nebula, the streaming site founded by myself and loads of other great creators,

45:37.880 --> 45:41.420
and where this documentary originally released.

45:41.420 --> 45:47.020
If you sign up for any CuriosityStream subscription at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover, you'll

45:47.020 --> 45:52.140
not only get access to thousands of top quality documentaries and TV shows on there, you'll

45:52.140 --> 45:56.560
