0	6080	What you're about to watch is a Nebula original, meaning it was first released on Nebula—the
6080	9520	streaming site founded by myself and plenty of other creators.
9520	13680	Producing this documentary was an enormous project which involved flying myself and a
13680	19560	crew 10,000 miles to one of the most remote places on earth, and it was entirely funded
19560	20840	by CuriosityStream.
20840	25520	That's because CuriosityStream has partnered with Nebula to offer a bundle deal where,
25520	30640	if you sign up at curiositystream.com slash wendover, you also get a Nebula subscription.
30640	32080	Easy as that.
32080	36000	On there you'll find loads of other great originals by independent creators, but for
36000	52040	now to the documentary.
66000	84600	It was this precise moment, early on a Saturday afternoon in October, 2017, that changed the
84600	89060	course of history for one of the world's most remote societies.
89060	94360	This moment that ended 500 years of isolation from the world, cutting travel time to there
94360	98320	from six days on a boat to six hours on a plane.
98320	103440	It was this small moment that changed everything for the island—an island where the thing
103440	107320	they need most of all, as much as it might hurt, is change.
107320	112120	It was this moment that, long in the future, will be recognized as the single most consequential
112120	115240	ever for the island of St Helena.
115240	120200	You'd be forgiven for not knowing exactly what or where St Helena is.
120200	123320	It's not a place that one hears a whole lot about.
123320	126120	If you have heard of it, that's likely thanks to Napoleon.
126120	131040	It's here, on St Helena, where the infamous emperor of France was exiled by the British
131040	133960	for the six years preceding his death.
133960	136840	Since then, though, the island has been up to quite a bit.
136840	141400	It's now home to about 4,500 of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.
141400	145660	Walking a block through its capital of Jamestown, it's tough to go without saying hi and hello
145660	147440	a half dozen times.
147440	151760	Driving past someone without giving a wave, well, that's practically a crime.
151760	155760	Saints, as the residents are called, are as proudly British as they come and fly their
155760	159140	Union Jacks copiously and conspicuously.
159140	162920	The island is, after all, a British overseas territory.
162920	165800	Life on St Helena is quite unlike life in the UK, though.
165800	170180	They've got their own money, their own accent, their own culture, their own government, but
170180	175360	most of all, what makes life on St Helena different is where it is.
175360	179040	The island sits in the same neighborhood as nothing.
179040	182960	London, Africa is 1,100 miles or 1,800 kilometers to its east.
182960	188560	Mainland South America is about 2,000 miles or 3,300 kilometers to its west.
188560	193400	London is over 4,600 miles or 7,500 kilometers to its north.
193400	200100	St Helena's isolation defines and shapes it in absolutely every way—including, perhaps
200100	203040	most consequentially, economically.
203040	206600	You see, St Helena is not a wealthy place.
206600	212860	Its GDP per capita averages just above $12,000 compared to about $40,000 in the UK.
212860	217440	The issue is that getting people and things to and from the middle of nowhere costs a
217440	221580	great deal, so there just aren't too many industries that can profitably operate on
221580	225020	a place as tiny and isolated as St Helena.
225020	227360	The Saints have found a few, though.
227360	231560	Beyond the traditional goods and services sectors that any small community would have,
231560	234120	St Helena does have exports.
234120	240120	Coffee, we have some of the rarest coffee in the world, which sells for, I know, 90
240120	244280	to 100 pounds in the United Kingdom for just 100 grams.
244280	249140	If we could increase that to some extent, that would bring revenue to many of the farmers
249140	250140	on the island.
250140	255340	They also sell a good amount of tuna and honey, but then there's another sector that capitalizes
255340	257120	on the island's isolation.
257120	265920	The predominant economy here at the moment is niche tourism—diving, history, natural
265920	271720	history—walking tours, bird watching, those sorts of things, plus also a growing market
271720	276680	of people who want to get away from it all, are one week away from the internet, and given
276680	280680	the internet prices here, that's quite easy to achieve if you want to do it.
280680	286040	But tourism would be nothing without a means to get off and on to St Helena Island.
286040	289980	It was only recently that this became something the government had to worry about.
289980	294240	In the early days of the island's human history, shipping was what brought a population
294240	295960	to it.
295960	299880	It was the perfect stopping point on the route from the Far East to Europe around the Cape
299880	304640	of Good Hope—so perfect, in fact, that if for a while, the entire island was run by
304640	307120	the British East India Company.
307120	311220	Eventually though, the Suez Canal opened and so fewer boats would round the southern tip
311220	312220	of Africa.
312580	317780	This, of course, diminished St Helena's importance, but still, up until the 1970s,
317780	321900	the island served as a regular stopping point for ocean liners traveling between the UK
321900	325980	and South Africa, meaning there was a reliable link to the outside world.
325980	331540	But then, throughout the 20th century, as air travel grew more popular and profitable,
331540	336000	passenger ocean liners around the world increasingly struggled to fill their ships, and one by
336000	338620	one closed down.
338620	343900	The last shipping line, with passenger service to St Helena, collapsed in 1977, leaving the
343900	347720	island marooned—with no way to get to the outside world.
347720	351380	The British stepped in, buying a ship for their overseas territory, which would be called
351380	353620	the RMS St Helena.
353620	357060	The RMS was part cargo ship, part passenger ship.
357060	360900	In the front, she carried dozens of shipping containers, acting as the primary supply line
360900	366500	for the island, and in the back, she was adorned with pools and bars and sun loungers.
366500	370580	Her regular journey consisted of the five nights from Cape Town to St Helena, then she
370580	374320	would continue on to Ascension Island in two or three nights, where she would meet and
374320	379060	connect her passengers to one of the bi-weekly Royal Air Force flights to the UK.
379060	384540	This method, via Ascension, allowed travelers to get from the UK to St Helena in relative
384540	387180	speed—just four days.
387180	390380	Most though, took the longer route from South Africa.
390380	393940	Locals and tourists alike adored the RMS.
393940	398660	She was thought of as the perfect transition from St Helena to the outside world or vice
398660	399660	versa.
399660	404820	She was a legendary, storied vessel, but after decades of heavy use shuttling passengers
404820	410500	to and from the island, in the early 2000s, the RMS was getting old and worn and the government
410500	413460	started to think about what would replace her.
413460	418820	Initial assessments found that replacing the ship would cost up to $100 million.
418820	424120	This led to the question—with that kind of money, was a ship really the best option?
424120	427740	The answer, it turned out, was probably not.
427740	433420	After decades of feasibility studies, discussions, debates, false starts, delays, and bidding,
433420	439180	a contract was produced and with a few quick signatures, life on St Helena would change
439180	440180	forever.
440180	442620	St Helena was getting an airport.
442940	448700	The contract was signed in November 2011 and that's when Basil Reid arrived on the island
448700	452360	to start basically looking at the infrastructure logistics.
452360	458780	They started the first construction or the first moving of soil in 2015 November and
458780	462180	obviously they built various roads up to the airport because they had to get the logistics
462180	463180	up to the airport.
463180	472340	They also had a ship that brought in all the materials, logistics, all the space, equipment
472340	475180	that had to obviously help to build the airport.
475180	480560	So they constructed it over four years at the end of 2050.
480560	485900	The runway was completed, most of the terminal buildings were completed, most of the CNS
485900	490620	equipment, which is communication and navigation equipment, was installed and the airport was
490620	495600	ready for a certification at the end of October 2015.
495600	497500	New airports are rare.
497500	502260	New airports in places that have never had an airport before are even rarer.
502260	507200	Getting an empty husk of an airport, certified and staffed, is no easy task.
507200	510900	For this to happen on St Helena, subcontractors were streaming through the island.
510900	513620	There were audits upon audits upon audits.
513620	515160	Staff members were recruited.
515160	518600	Locals were trained both on and off island for jobs like security, immigration, firefighting
518600	519700	and more.
519700	523100	Emergency procedures were written, public meetings were conducted, airport vehicles
523100	527540	were shipped in, instruments were calibrated, beacons and localizers and obstacle lights
527540	533020	were installed, a logo was designed, calibration flights came in, emergency drills were conducted,
533020	538620	drone mods were codified, operational trials were run, and then finally, in February 2016,
538620	541820	the airport was certified and ready to open.
541820	546500	Commercial flights could start, and St Helena would achieve its decades-long ambition of
546500	550060	having an air link to the outside world.
550060	552360	There was just one more step.
552360	556980	As one last hurdle of bureaucracy, Comair, the airline contracted to operate flights
556980	561780	to St Helena, wanted to perform an implementation flight, as they called it.
561780	565980	Essentially, they were going to fly one of their planes in to test that everything, from
565980	569820	the instruments to the runway to the terminal to the fuel system, worked.
569820	574500	Now, Comair was really the perfect airline to connect St Helena to the world.
574500	579260	They're a British Airways franchisee, meaning they are contracted by British Airways to
579260	583660	operate their regional flights from South Africa and therefore fly a number of routes
583660	586640	around the region under the British Airways brand.
586640	591440	The plan was for Comair to operate a British Airways route non-stop from Johannesburg to
591440	592660	St Helena.
592660	596840	These flights would seamlessly connect to other British Airways flights to the two locations
596840	602460	Saints travel most—Capetown and London—as well as with hundreds of other destinations
602460	603820	around the world.
603820	607700	With the exception of a direct flight to the UK, there's really nothing better St Helena
607700	609620	Airport could have wished for.
609620	612480	They just had to do the implementation flight.
612480	619120	So, on one sunny, nearly cloudless April day in 2016, a Comair 737 appeared off in
619120	623160	the distance to the north of St Helena Airport carrying a handful of staff members of the
623160	625820	airline and airport construction company.
625820	630980	It approached, wheels up, in order to perform a flyby above the runway, as planned.
630980	635360	After gaining altitude again, it circled back around in order to make a second and final
635360	636880	approach.
636880	643060	But then, just seconds away from touchdown, there was a sort of wobble.
643060	644480	Then another one.
644480	648920	Then once its wheels were just feet above the runway, the pilots elected to abort the
648920	652280	landing, go around, and give it another shot.
652280	657960	So, the plane circled around again and, after some more wobbling, came to a landing—the
657960	662600	first ever landing of a commercial passenger jet on the island, even if it wasn't carrying
662600	663960	commercial passengers.
664480	666840	St Helena was thrilled.
666840	671000	I'm here with Basarites Island Director, Dejan Diake.
671000	675280	Dejan, you just arrived on the first passenger jet to land here on St Helena.
675280	676920	Can you describe the experience?
676920	678920	Great experience.
678920	682880	I mean, it's just a cherry on the cake after the four years work.
682880	688480	Friday, Friday morning, I flew out on the AC flight, I went home, spent the weekend
688480	693680	with the family, played golf yesterday, and today I'm back on the island.
693680	696120	I mean, that's the signs of the times, eh?
696120	700320	And that's the whole reason for the airport, is to be able to travel back and forth as
700320	701440	you please.
701440	706720	Susan Obey and Graham Vess, guys, you were here to witness the first ever passenger jet
706720	707720	land on St Helena.
707720	710080	First of all, you, Graham, how does it feel?
710080	712520	Can you describe the experience?
712520	717280	It was absolutely amazing and I feel really privileged to be here at this momentous occasion.
717280	719680	It really is such a historic event.
719680	721440	I feel absolutely wonderful.
721440	725160	I feel proud of everything that's been done by you guys on the island.
725160	726160	Thank you.
726160	728160	And you, Susan?
728160	730080	Excited, extremely excited.
730080	737520	This is like the culmination of weeks, months, years of hard work, as far back as 2005, and
737520	741760	we're really, really proud of everything that's been achieved today.
741760	746340	This is the first step, you know, a plane landing on St Helena.
746340	748520	What does this now mean for tourism on St Helena?
748600	751560	Well, now we've got the gateway to get people here.
751560	754740	Before we had to rely on the ship, the RMS coming backwards and forwards.
754740	756280	This means we can have a steady stream.
756280	759880	At first, it'll be that Saturday flight people will get used to, and then once that's
759880	763400	been filling up, hopefully we'll have a midweek one, and that's the way we can really
763400	764400	develop tourism.
764400	768880	And it becomes worth people investing in—restaurants, bars, other things that'll help the tourists
768880	769880	here.
769880	772120	So, the start of a new era for St Helena.
772120	778600	Tourism was ecstatic, but at the time, nobody fully understood what had just happened.
778600	784800	You see, this little wobble—just before landing—had just derailed the decades-long
784800	789000	plan for St Helena's new era.
789000	794320	That wobble was evidence of wind shear—a phenomenon where wind traveling in one direction
794320	799660	meets wind traveling in another direction and creates a zone of turbulent air.
799660	803680	In St Helena's case, its wind shear was due to the already strong wind being pushed
803680	808340	around and rerouted by the enormous cliffs at the northern end of its runway.
808340	813500	When coming in to land an airplane, wind is already a hassle, but when it quickly shifts,
813500	818500	as in the case of wind shear, it can be a lot worse.
818500	822060	The first sign to the general public that something was wrong was when the St Helena
822060	826180	government postponed the long-scheduled airport opening ceremony, which was planned to be
826180	828460	presided upon by Prince Andrew.
828540	832900	Eventually, it emerged that the solution would be to land planes from the south, as there
832900	838840	was not a wind shear issue from this direction, but this did have its own issues.
838840	842980	Planes generally like to land into the wind, as this allows them to stop faster on the
842980	847740	runway, but at the airport, wind almost always comes from the south, meaning planes would
847740	849780	be landing with a tailwind.
849780	854740	In order to successfully land a 737 with a tailwind on the length of runway offered at
854740	859220	St Helena, the 737 would have to be quite light.
859220	863020	It wouldn't be able to take its full capacity of passengers or cargo.
863020	867520	In fact, it would have to shed so much weight that the flight would never be commercially
867520	873160	profitable for Comair, even with the planned subsidies, and so, unceremoniously, it was
873160	878020	announced that Comair, and therefore British Airways, would not be running the flights
878020	879620	to St Helena.
879620	883740	Eventually, the story of St Helena Airport reached the world.
883740	887300	The British tabloids got their hands on it and ripped it to shreds.
887300	894060	They called the airport embarrassing—a gaffe, a folly, a farcical vanity project.
894060	897100	Much of what was reported wasn't even accurate.
897100	901020	Tabloids said it was impossible to land, they said the airport was closed, neither of which
901020	902160	was true.
902160	906420	In fact, throughout the delay, private and medevac flights were coming in and out with
906420	907540	no problem.
907540	912500	The media latched on to the video of that Comair implementation flight and, as one outlet
912500	916220	called it, the terrifying three attempts it took to land.
916220	921860	In reality, it was one planned flyby, one aborted landing, and one successful landing.
921860	926320	In the world of commercial aviation, aborted landings are nothing exceptional.
926320	931180	They happen many times a day at airports large and small all around the world.
931180	935940	Most of all, though, the common thread between all the media reports was the nickname St
935940	941860	Helena Airport received—the world's most useless airport.
941860	943660	That was the one that stunned.
943660	949920	And I think a lot of the sort of initial label given by the popular media has not helped
949920	952700	the island, and I think it's totally false, quite frankly.
952700	957480	We knew that St. Helena was going to get a lot of flak over it from the media.
957480	965180	We didn't quite appreciate how much it was going to feature, but it became a lot about
965180	969280	how bad the British government had done in investing in the airport on St. Helena and
969280	971300	putting it in the wrong place, essentially.
971300	977140	When the bad press hit of St. Helena having a white elephant for an airport, I was really
977140	978260	angry.
978260	984140	And still today, in my professional capacity, we are countering and battling to get rid
984140	986900	of that negativity.
986900	992060	It is really bad, and people don't want to see the good that is actually happening.
992060	999700	Since all of those articles, we've had to spend a lot of time, I suppose, trying to
999700	1005020	sell the island for its positive aspects, and also show things like there's only been
1005020	1009580	one cancellation in the entire year this year, but those things are harder to get through
1009580	1012140	than the sensationalist stuff that sells papers.
1012140	1015820	You always have start and end problems, and what would you expect?
1015820	1018980	We are in the middle of the South Atlantic.
1018980	1020700	This is the first time for it to happen.
1020700	1025020	So you've got to have trial and error, and I wish people would just leave the error now
1025020	1028940	aside and look at what is happening as a result.
1028940	1033220	In order to shrug off that nickname, they needed, of course, a flight.
1033220	1035460	So we had to do a lot of research.
1035460	1040700	So we commissioned our UK Met office to do a lot of research on our wind data.
1040700	1045380	So we collated a lot of wind data over six months, twelve months, so we could ascertain
1045380	1049700	exactly what the conditions were on runway 20 and runway 02.
1049700	1055420	Once we got all that data into place, then the SHG government went out with a new tender,
1055420	1060260	looking for an aircraft that could actually land runway 02, which had a 15 knot tailwind
1060260	1061260	component.
1061260	1065580	It was runway 20 that had the wind shear issue, not runway 02.
1065580	1070260	These two are, in fact, the same physical runway, but runway 20 refers to the landing
1070260	1074540	coming from the north, runway 02 refers to the landing from the south.
1074540	1079180	The prevailing winds originate from the south, so the key to a safe landing was an aircraft
1079180	1084220	small enough to stop safely within the length of the runway even when wind pushes it from
1084220	1085220	behind.
1085420	1090660	That way, if the wind shear from the north is too bad, it can land from the south.
1090660	1093660	The service was not to be subsidized, but rather underwritten.
1093660	1100660	There isn't a subsidy per passenger, so they don't get paid, let's say, ten pounds
1100660	1102940	per passenger per flight at all.
1102940	1108700	It's very much a commercial service, but if that commercial service makes a loss, that
1108700	1113620	loss is underwritten by DFID in the UK.
1113620	1117480	Two main bidders emerged to operate the flights to St Helena.
1117480	1121980	The first was a company called Atlantic Star Airlines.
1121980	1126660	Founded in 2012, still the early days of the airport construction process, Atlantic Star
1126660	1131340	was created specifically to serve as an airline for St Helena.
1131340	1135580	Their original plan was to make weekly flights directly from London to St Helena via some
1135580	1139500	midway refueling stop in addition to a weekly flight to Cape Town.
1139500	1143020	It was an ambitious plan, but they were serious about it.
1143020	1147420	The company consisted of seasoned aviation executives and professionals including a CEO
1147420	1149660	who came from British Airways.
1149660	1153360	Over time, though, the plan was scaled back to operating a few charter flights a year
1153360	1156860	from London to St Helena via Banjul in the Gambia.
1156860	1158860	This was going to happen.
1158860	1163540	They had an agreement with TUI Airlines to charter A737, they had announced schedules,
1163540	1168460	they had set fares, but then, of course, the airport's opening was delayed, and these
1168460	1172160	flights were all cancelled.
1172160	1176880	After some time, in October 2016, Atlantic Star came back into the story by chartering
1176880	1182280	an Avro RJ1000 to fly to the island and run a series of test landings—a move the company
1182280	1186160	tried to use as evidence of their legitimacy in the bidding process.
1186160	1190920	The proposal was that they would lease an Avro jet to be based on St Helena as the island's
1190920	1192620	dedicated aircraft.
1192620	1196200	Twice a week, they would fly the hour and a half north to Ascension Island to connect
1196200	1199400	with the bi-weekly RAF flights to the UK.
1199400	1204000	Having the aircraft based on St Helena would, according to their bid, be quite the benefit
1204000	1208360	for the island considering that it could, at a moment's notice, fly medical evacuation
1208360	1211980	flights, rather than waiting for a plane to fly in from South Africa to pick a patient
1211980	1212980	up.
1212980	1215280	Ultimately, though, the bid failed.
1215280	1219720	The other major bid submitted to the St Helena government was by a South African airline
1219720	1221680	called Airlink.
1221680	1227360	Their plan was to fly an Embraer E190 jet to St Helena once weekly on Saturdays.
1227360	1230960	The aircraft would fly from Johannesburg to Windhoek, Namibia where it would meet another
1230960	1233020	service coming in from Cape Town.
1233020	1237480	This connecting structure was viewed as quite important since, while most of the St Diaspora
1237480	1242440	is in Cape Town, Johannesburg is the larger airport and offers more connections.
1242440	1246880	From Windhoek, it would then fly the three hours over the South Atlantic to land in St
1246880	1247960	Helena.
1247960	1250340	It would then do the same in reverse.
1250340	1254320	Included in Airlink's bid was an agreement to operate once monthly charter flights from
1254320	1258620	St Helena to Ascension Island as an add-on to their flight from Johannesburg, giving
1258620	1263220	that island, which primarily serves as a military base for the UK and US, its only regularly
1263220	1266580	scheduled non-military flight to the outside world.
1266580	1270560	This bid was as close to perfect St Helena was going to get.
1270560	1275760	On July 21, 2017, the St Helena government signed a contract with Airlink and announced
1275760	1280200	to the world that this tiny South Atlantic outpost was finally getting its connection
1280200	1281200	to the world.
1281620	1285180	St Helena was getting a flight—for real this time.
1285180	1289640	A few months later, just over a year after that Comair flight had arrived in the skies
1289640	1294000	above St Helena, an Airlink in Rhear E190 did the same.
1294000	1298900	It was filled with 70 or so journalists, tourists, and saints, and soon enough, safely touched
1298900	1303740	down and was greeted by, well, a big proportion of St Helena.
1303740	1307080	That was St Helena's before and after moment.
1307080	1312460	Once those wheels touched down, St Helena would never be the same.
1312460	1317180	But once that happened, once the honeymoon period was over, it was time for St Helena
1317180	1319340	to get to work.
1319340	1323300	Realizing the full potential of the airport was no easy task.
1323300	1327420	Of course the natural environment presented its own issues, but the true challenge lies
1327420	1331600	in the island's geographic isolation and political independence which mean that, in
1331600	1335300	all aspects, the airport has to be entirely self-sufficient.
1336000	1340600	They're not run by some big company, they're not part of any national system.
1340600	1346800	St Helena Airport is run by St Helena Airport Limited and, if Gwyneth Howell, its CEO, doesn't
1346800	1350660	know what to do, there's not really anyone she can call.
1350660	1355360	That means that everything needed to run St Helena Airport, from administrative to operational,
1355360	1358600	has to happen at St Helena Airport.
1358600	1363160	It turns out that, even with just one weekly flight, that's quite a lot.
1363540	1369120	What we have is, for example, in this room here, we have what's called CNS, so Communications,
1369120	1371060	Navigations and Surveillance.
1371060	1375500	We have two guys, one who works on IT side of things, one who works on the navigation
1375500	1377420	aids and so on.
1377420	1380660	They're really crucial to the running of the airport.
1380660	1386420	Without the Communications, Navigations system, without those IT systems in place, we wouldn't
1386420	1391460	be able to land aircraft and take off aircraft here at the airport.
1391460	1393320	That's extremely important.
1393320	1399840	CEO's office, obviously we need a Chief Executive Officer for St Helena Airport Limited and
1399840	1401480	then there's my office next door.
1401480	1408880	I'm kind of the CEO's right-hand person, so I will always be there to support them, but
1408880	1413720	I'm also kind of separate as well, because I'm meant to be there to be the conscience
1413720	1420120	almost of the company, to do the thinking, to do the questioning, why are we doing it
1420120	1421120	like that?
1421260	1422260	Could we do it another way?
1422260	1423260	Could we do it a safer way?
1423260	1424260	Could we do it a better way?
1424260	1427220	So that's a pretty important role.
1427220	1432360	So if we carry on this way, actually, this is an important room to look in.
1432360	1438880	It's the gym and it's where our RFS team keep fit.
1438880	1445060	Being in the Firefighting Service, it's a very physical job, so you need to be fit all
1445060	1446060	the time.
1446060	1450660	In fact, there are fitness levels to be met, so the gym is an important part of that.
1451200	1452200	Hello, Bill.
1452200	1453200	Hello.
1453200	1454200	Security.
1454200	1459400	Because I'm not security cleared, I can't go in there, even though I'm sort of senior
1459400	1460400	management team.
1460400	1466640	There are still levels of security that some of us can't get into, and this is one room
1466640	1469280	that I'm not permitted to go into, and rightly so.
1469280	1476320	So if you want to follow me down in the rest of the combined building, so we have a training
1476320	1480060	room, so there's an awful lot of training that goes on for staff.
1480060	1484740	We need to be accredited in many respects, so there's a lot of training that goes on
1484740	1488660	security in particular, but also firefighting as well.
1488660	1493100	So that's our training room.
1493100	1503620	Walking on further down, we also have a maintenance bay as well, which I'll briefly open the door,
1503620	1504620	and walk in.
1505320	1510800	The maintenance bay is where we obviously maintain equipment, and we have a lot of equipment
1510800	1515520	to maintain, and we have an on-site mechanic who does so.
1515520	1517960	So we also use it for storage as well.
1517960	1528280	So this, for example, is a tow barless tug, allows us to tow aircraft if we need to, and
1528280	1532980	other bits and pieces like the toilet cart and so on.
1532980	1539200	So it's a multi-purpose bay, we use it for storage and we use it for maintaining our
1539200	1540200	vehicles.
1540200	1549780	So if we're moving along, finally come to the end, and it's the most important room
1549780	1553960	in the building because these people make sure we get paid.
1553960	1562120	So here we have, good afternoon, we have HR and Finance.
1562120	1570080	Really important to running a small but compact airport.
1570080	1575500	But nevertheless, there's all the HR and financial functions that go with that.
1575500	1579580	In addition to all the administrative functions, St Helena airport, while it might need less
1579580	1584440	of it, needs all the same things that an enormous airport like Heathrow would need.
1584440	1587300	A striking example of this is the fire service.
1587300	1591740	ICAO regulation basically states that every airport has to have some sort of firefighter
1591740	1592740	category.
1592740	1597680	It really depends on the movement of the aircraft within that airfield.
1597680	1601080	That's regulation and that is what we have to provide.
1601080	1605440	We are always on standby, so if there's an aircraft emergency right now and we get
1605440	1610040	the crash alarms go, we can provide a three-minute response to the runway.
1610040	1614360	That's despite the fact that most days, there isn't a single aircraft within hundreds
1614360	1619700	of miles of the island, but nonetheless, it's what's required by regulation.
1619700	1623800	Even at an airport with thousands of weekly flights, it's not as if firefighters are
1623800	1627920	responding to fires all that often, which means that there's no real reason for those
1627920	1630980	airports to have more than one firefighting crew.
1630980	1634840	The result is that an airport like St Helena, which has one or two commercial flights a
1634840	1639200	week, needs firefighting capabilities pretty similar to an airport like Heathrow, which
1639200	1640200	has thousands.
1640200	1645160	That's part of what balloons the cost of running such a small airport.
1645160	1649500	Given the isolation of the island, weather forecasting is another crucially important
1649500	1654460	yet challenging part of what's needed to keep the weekly flight reliable and safe.
1654460	1659860	The UK Met Office stations meteorologists on St Helena on more or less yearly rotations.
1659860	1663860	After a Saturday flight, I usually have the Sunday and Monday off, so when I come in on
1663860	1667420	Tuesday, that's when I first start looking at what the weather's going to be like for
1667420	1670500	the next flight day, which is usually the Saturday.
1670500	1676260	As we get nearer to the time, I start to do more detailed forecasts for the airline.
1676260	1683700	So on a Friday, I produce a detailed forecast for their estimated time of arrival on Saturday.
1683700	1688720	And then I come in at four o'clock on the Saturday morning and update that forecast
1688720	1693960	and forward that to the flight operations.
1693960	1697600	The reason this is so important is so that they know, when an aircraft is supposed to
1697600	1702620	get to St Helena airport, it'll be able to land at St Helena airport.
1702620	1708700	The main problem is because of the remoteness of the airfield, there are no nearby diversions,
1708700	1713820	so they can't arrive here and spend two hours circling and then divert to a nearby
1713820	1714920	airfield.
1714920	1720120	If they come here, then they've got to be 99% convinced that they're going to be able
1720120	1721520	to land.
1721520	1728640	So I will be looking at cloud basin visibility as the major things that would stop them from
1728640	1731180	landing at St Helena.
1731180	1737320	The reason being, because of their restrictions, they have to be visual with the airfield before
1737320	1739000	they can land.
1739000	1744180	So if the cloud base is below 900 feet, then they won't be able to see the airfield before
1744180	1745740	their decision hike.
1745740	1749560	Assuming the airline has that required level of confidence that the flight will be able
1749560	1754340	to successfully land at St Helena, AirLink will give it clearance to depart from Johannesburg
1754340	1756400	at about 9 am local time.
1756400	1762300	It'll then make the two-hour flight to Walvis Bay, Namibia—a more or less regular flight.
1762300	1767160	At Walvis Bay, they'll refuel the aircraft's tanks, giving them about six hours of flying
1767160	1770560	time, but also at this top, they'll have to once again decide whether they'll be
1770560	1772900	able to land at St Helena.
1772900	1777780	This time, the level of confidence has to be higher than it was even in Johannesburg,
1777780	1782260	but assuming they are confident, the flight will take off, climb to altitude, and begin
1782260	1787420	its three-hour ocean crossing—but the decisions still aren't over.
1787420	1791420	Throughout this crossing, the airline will be continuously evaluating the conditions
1791420	1795860	on the island to assure they'll be able to land and, if they believe they can't,
1795860	1798620	they'll turn back for Namibia.
1798620	1803180	Assuming they continue on, eventually, they will then approach the island, drop altitude,
1803180	1806360	and connect by radio with the airport's air traffic controller.
1806360	1811600	But then, even once there, if the cloud levels are too low or the wind is too strong, the
1811600	1814240	plane still won't be able to land.
1814240	1819080	So when they get here and they're not able on the first attempt to land, they will do
1819080	1825800	a go-around, they will go into a holding pattern, and they will wait for a few minutes, based
1825800	1830840	on what we have in terms of satellite image for the weather.
1830840	1834560	It could be ten minutes, it could be five minutes, it could be as soon as they go around,
1834560	1839700	when they come back they can see the runway, and then they'll be able to do a landing.
1839700	1845180	So in the unlikely event that a successful landing cannot be completed, then the aircraft
1845180	1846680	will have to divert.
1846680	1850240	St Helena's closest diversion point is Ascension Island.
1850240	1855040	It's about an hour and a half flight north, so this is likely where any flight would divert
1855040	1857760	if landing at St Helena was not possible.
1857760	1861400	There they have fuels and facilities so the air-link flight could give landing on St Helena
1861400	1863480	another shot the day after.
1863480	1867900	In the time that St Helena airport has been open, no commercial flight has ever failed
1867900	1870000	landing and had to divert.
1870000	1875780	In fact, in the first ten months of 2019, the airport didn't even have a single cancelled
1875780	1877120	flight.
1877120	1882680	Every Saturday, at about 1.15 pm, an air-link Embraer E190 has reliably pierced through
1882680	1887520	the clouds above St Helena's airport, ready to drop off another load of eager tourists
1887520	1890140	and wistful locals.
1890180	1893620	The holidays at St Helena airport are an event.
1893620	1897940	Despite its tiny size, people start arriving at the building three to four hours in advance
1897940	1898940	of the flight.
1898940	1903700	While the plane might only seat 96 people, every flight sees a crowd far larger as extended
1903700	1908020	families of every saint arriving and leaving seem to show up.
1908020	1912580	Just for the flight day, there opens a bank branch, a gift shop, a luggage wrapping business,
1912580	1914800	a cafe, and a restaurant.
1914800	1918260	Those not taking the flight will stand in the check-in hall, looking to see who's
1918260	1922500	arriving, then make their way up to the restaurant once the passengers pass through security.
1922500	1927480	Then, as the time draws near, everyone packs into the observation deck—far busier than
1927480	1931900	that of any of the world's largest airports—and look to the left.
1931900	1936660	It's reminiscent of sailors watching to be the first to see land, but in this case,
1936660	1941420	it's saints trying to be the first to see their link to the outside world—a world
1941420	1944820	that some of them have only seen through screens.
1944820	1950400	They try to spot the small metal tube that represents the link between them and us.
1950400	1956060	With patience, the time comes, and the Embraer E190 appears in St Helena's skies.
1956060	1960460	It makes its approach, usually jostled around by the consistently inconsistent winds, then
1960460	1965700	passes the daunting cliff at the end of the runway, then glides smoothly into touchdown.
1965700	1969460	That's when the airport truly comes alive.
1969460	1973660	Only 75 minutes sits between the scheduled landing time and the scheduled takeoff time
1973660	1978740	each Saturday, so, as soon as the aircraft takes its right turn towards the apron, there
1978740	1982300	begins a carefully choreographed dance.
1982300	1985920	The aircraft is marshalled in, then first to approach are the air stairs followed by
1985920	1990540	the ground power unit that gives energy to the aircraft when it sits powered down.
1990540	1994140	While the cleaners approach the aircraft, the baggage compartment of the aircraft is
1994140	1999460	opened, the fuel truck gets into position, and the first passengers start to disembark.
1999460	2003980	With certain jobs only needing to happen once a week, quite a few staff at the airport
2003980	2005460	work multiple jobs.
2005460	2009120	The firefighters, for example, go straight from their truck, assuring that the aircraft
2009120	2011620	has landed safely, to handling baggage.
2011620	2015780	At the back of the aircraft, all the sewage from the lavatory has to be emptied and an
2015780	2020020	ambulift is used to lift passengers with reduced mobility on and off.
2020020	2024380	The pilots qualified to land at St Helena are among the most senior and experienced
2024380	2028820	at AirLink which means there are fewer than ten pilots who work the route.
2028820	2033560	Therefore, they visit the island on average about once a month but, since the aircraft
2033560	2039000	only stays there for just over an hour, have never seen more of the island than the airport.
2039000	2042860	During their time on the island, though, they'll perform a safety inspection of the plane and
2042860	2046460	then, soon enough, it'll be time to load up.
2046460	2051680	Boarding the 96 or fewer passengers doesn't take long and quickly, the door will close,
2051680	2054780	the stairs will pull away, and the aircraft will taxi back to the runway.
2054780	2059860	It will take a turn to the north, roll its way down to the end of the runway, turn around,
2059860	2064180	then thunder down St Helena's spotlessly clean piece of pavement to take off on its
2064180	2068300	four and a half hour trip back to Johannesburg.
2068300	2072980	With that, the clock starts ticking again as the airport preps for its next 75 minutes
2072980	2077740	in the spotlight and then everyone makes their way to their homes or hotels, starting their
2077740	2082400	next week of isolation from the world.
2082400	2086240	Of course the Saints love the airport while they're at it—while they're standing
2086240	2090360	in the observation deck watching the plane fly off, destined for Johannesburg in a quick
2090360	2091760	four and a half hours.
2091760	2095560	For those that have lived their entire lives on St Helena, the prospect of getting to South
2095560	2099560	Africa in a matter of hours still seems like magic.
2099560	2104200	Once people go home, though, the question that comes up frequently in conversation is,
2104200	2105200	was it worth it?
2105200	2112160	2013 and 2014, when they were building the airport, was a big significant boom for St
2112160	2113160	Helena.
2113160	2120440	The amount of people that were in and out of the island, a lot of St Helenaians saw
2120440	2124280	airplane for the first time in their life.
2124280	2130560	The economy was actually thriving, so it was a buildup to what was the airport going to
2130560	2131960	bring for St Helena.
2131960	2136920	I would say people expected the airport to bring quite significant change.
2136920	2143400	Now whether those expectations were reasonable is something that is perhaps debatable.
2143400	2148560	The once a week flight is OK, but at the end of the day, if you bring in a plane which
2148560	2157240	can carry potentially 90 passengers, that's not enough to be able to generate a significant
2157240	2159600	increase in the footfall on St Helena.
2159600	2163760	I think there's an expectation that the service perhaps isn't delivering what it
2163760	2172160	should, but I think we also have to take into account the fact that we're still not trying—we're
2172160	2180080	still a relatively untested market, both for tourists and also for potential investors.
2180080	2183800	Looking at the graphs, the airport has had some effect.
2183800	2190440	In the 12 months after its opening, 3,337 people arrived on the island by plane.
2190440	2195840	That's compared to just 2,616 passengers who had arrived the previous 12 months on
2195840	2197100	the RMS.
2197100	2203320	In the airport's second year of operations, 4,188 passengers arrived via the airport,
2203320	2207760	which certainly is a measurable improvement, although overall visitor arrivals to the island
2207760	2211960	stayed about the same as there was a period of overlap between the start of flights and
2211960	2213640	the end of the RMS service.
2213640	2218440	It's tough to measure the true success of the airport yet, just two years into service,
2218440	2223200	but what's sure is that there has been no tourism explosion.
2223200	2228400	Flights are expensive, infrequent, and indirect for everyone but South Africans, and this
2228400	2232120	has kept the island a niche destination.
2232120	2236340	The island certainly had to hurry up and wait as, while the first flight might have been
2236340	2242020	the impetus for change, it certainly didn't change everything overnight.
2242020	2246780	Success for St Helena airport, however, cannot be measured solely by visitor numbers.
2246780	2252820	It can also be measured in lives—the number of lives this solitary piece of pavement has
2252820	2253820	saved.
2253820	2259140	I was in my last trimester, feeling normal pregnancy up until the last when my blood
2259140	2261380	pressure kind of spiked.
2261940	2269580	So the concern was pretty clampsier, and they decided that I needed an emergency cesarean.
2269580	2278700	So Eli was born about four weeks earlier than expected.
2278700	2291220	He—we had him around half sex Wednesday evening, and he had a bit of a restless night,
2291740	2299540	breathing wasn't so good, although that was to be expected because of the C-section.
2299540	2307500	The next morning, the midwife came in, and she said no, breathing wasn't normal, and
2307500	2315620	they decided to put him on the ventilator and have him assessed, so they did so many
2315620	2322100	tests, and he had respiratory distress syndrome.
2322100	2332100	And about, like, eleven-ish on Thursday night, Dr Kevin O'Brien and Helen Lawrence came
2332100	2340140	in to our room to say that he would need to be medivaced.
2340180	2347020	The RMS was on its last journey to the UK, so the first reaction was, how do we get him
2347020	2348740	out?
2348740	2355700	And then it was—we were told that they had already decided to get a medivac flight in.
2355700	2361620	Two days after Eli was born, on a Friday afternoon, a small jet from a South African medical evacuation
2361620	2366500	company touched down at St Helena airport, representing only the fourth arrival by a
2366500	2369060	fixed-wing aircraft to the island.
2369060	2373520	The team spent the afternoon evaluating Eli's condition and then early the following morning,
2373520	2377740	him and his mother, Patrice, were transferred by ambulance to the airport and brought onto
2377740	2378740	the jet.
2378740	2383420	After a quick four hours crossing the South Atlantic, they touched down in Cape Town and
2383420	2388860	by 2pm local time arrived at Vincent Pilati Hospital with all the facilities Eli needed,
2388860	2392060	just about five hours after leaving the hospital in St Helena.
2392060	2398020	If it wasn't for the airport, then I really thought that Eli would have made it.
2398020	2403820	It would have been a long wait for the RMS to come down, like another month, and then
2403820	2405500	the weeks travel to Cape Town.
2405500	2409940	He probably wouldn't have made it waiting for the month for the ship to actually get
2409940	2410940	there.
2410940	2417860	So, you know, without the airport, I don't think Eli would have made it, would have survived.
2417860	2420740	Today, Eli is a perfectly healthy young boy.
2420740	2427020	He's one of the handful of saints who quite directly owe their lives to the airport.
2427020	2432160	Construction is dangerous and St Helena's hospital just isn't equipped to handle advanced
2432160	2434440	medical conditions.
2434440	2439360	Before the airport, that medical risk just came with the territory and in some cases,
2439360	2445460	survival was down to luck—the luck of where the RMS was on its voyage schedule.
2445460	2450100	One can't easily argue against anything that saves lives, no matter the cost, but
2450100	2453820	the truth is that, when the British government spent their hundreds of millions of dollars
2453820	2459300	to build St Helena airport, they had more than the humanitarian benefits in mind.
2459300	2464700	In the two years since its opening, the airport has brought change, but it has not yet fundamentally
2464700	2467340	transformed what St Helena is.
2467340	2475460	I think that the potential for the island is actually really quite strong and I think
2475460	2481860	that, but I think as with all emerging destinations, it's going to take a while.
2481860	2487020	What I think is worrying, though, is that for a lot of people, it's how long will
2487020	2488740	that while be?
2488740	2493800	Is it going to be five years, ten years, twenty years, nobody really knows?
2493800	2497900	Long term, the airport's ambition is, of course, to grow the island's economy.
2497900	2502180	The UK's Department for International Development conducted a business case for the airport
2502180	2507880	way back in 2010 and developed a tourism growth estimate for St Helena based on how other
2507880	2511880	similar islands fared in the industry after improving their access.
2511880	2517900	This model, starting at about 1,000 tourists per year in 2016, projected growth to 30,000
2517900	2522580	yearly tourists in 2042—a number that has been subject to intense scrutiny everywhere
2522580	2526720	from the St Helena dinner table to the parliament of the United Kingdom.
2526720	2530900	The data show, though, that accounting for the one-year delay in the airport's opening,
2530900	2535660	current visitor arrivals are exactly on target for this growth.
2535660	2539940	What that means is that the airport project is not doomed from the start.
2539940	2544380	What will determine its success is what's to come, and the Christmas 2019 season is
2544380	2548040	bringing something promising—sold out flights.
2548040	2553020	The holidays are by far the most popular season for travel to St Helena and with that, in
2553020	2557360	the months of December, January, and February, AirLink has added Tuesday flights from Cape
2557360	2560140	Down—a first for the island.
2560140	2565180	In addition, there's another promising sign—in their first year of operation, the flights
2565180	2569220	actually turned a small profit for AirLink.
2569220	2574300	Longer term, the island has ambitions for an even more extensive network of flights.
2574300	2578140	One goal would be to get a route to a South American city like Kissifi to allow for a
2578140	2580660	more direct route from the Americas.
2580660	2584340	Technically, this would be feasible as it's only a four-hour flight.
2584340	2587120	Commercially, though, that's another question.
2587120	2591380	Also on the wishlist is a round-trip flight to Namibia to tap into their large tourism
2591380	2592380	market.
2592380	2597540	However, the largest tourist demographic for the island by far is British and so the crown
2597540	2600940	jewel of routes would be to the UK.
2600940	2606600	Since before the airport even opened, there's been talk of a route to London via Cape Verde.
2606600	2609720	Right now, though, these are all just dreams.
2609720	2614620	An airline would only take the enormous risk of starting a route to St Helena if it proved
2614620	2618240	not only commercially viable, but successful.
2618240	2620940	That has not happened yet.
2620940	2624940	The next couple years for St Helena are crucial.
2624940	2629140	As the number of successful completed flights ticks up, data will prove whether they're
2629140	2634620	sticking to this line—the line that will determine whether St Helena will survive economically
2634620	2636580	into the far future.
2636580	2641020	If they stick to it, they're in for an economic renaissance.
2641020	2645460	If they start to fall below it, there's little hope for any sort of self-sufficiency
2645460	2650980	meaning the island will remain at the mercy of the UK's budgetary allocations.
2650980	2655300	St Helena was never supposed to change overnight, and the airport was never supposed to be a
2655300	2657180	magic cure-all.
2657180	2662460	The airport is a tool for change, not the impetus of change itself.
2662460	2667580	For the island to fundamentally change, it has to sell itself to the world.
2667580	2672260	It has to one by one convince people to come to it, to invest in it, to take a risk on
2672260	2676460	a place that's competing with an entire world of options.
2676460	2682240	Time has proven that St Helena airport is not the world's most useless airport.
2682240	2688060	It has rather proven that it has the potential to become the world's most useful airport—an
2688060	2692460	airport that could save lives, revitalize an economy, and connect a forgotten dot on
2692460	2694320	the map to the rest of it.
2694320	2698660	An airport that could rescue an island from falling into the same fate of so many like
2698660	2703980	it—crumbling into irrelevance as its people are slowly drawn to the urban world.
2703980	2718180	So now that the island has their tool, all they have to do is use it.
2718180	2724540	As I mentioned at the start, this entire project was made possible thanks to CuriosityStream.
