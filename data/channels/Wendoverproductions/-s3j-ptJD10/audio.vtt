00:11.100 --> 00:18.220
Antarctica is the earth's coldest, most desolate, most isolated, windiest, driest,

00:18.220 --> 00:20.280
and southernmost continent.

00:20.280 --> 00:25.180
All but 2% of the landmass is covered in ice thousands of feet thick.

00:25.180 --> 00:29.400
Human eyes did not gaze upon the continent until 1820.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.580
Human feet did not touch Antarctica until 1895.

00:33.580 --> 00:39.260
It is not a place built for humans, but still, thousands of people live there for up to years

00:39.260 --> 00:40.380
on end.

00:40.380 --> 00:45.900
But how do they get there, how do they live there, and how does Antarctica work?

00:45.900 --> 00:50.780
Antarctica has thousands of residents, significant infrastructure, and a large transport network

00:50.780 --> 00:56.000
and yet it's one of the very few areas of land on earth not part of any country.

00:56.140 --> 01:02.640
Seven countries have made Antarctic claims—Chile, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Norway, Australia,

01:02.640 --> 01:07.020
France, and New Zealand—but they are exactly that—claims.

01:07.020 --> 01:11.880
The only real gauge of whether a country's territorial claim is real is if other countries

01:11.880 --> 01:16.200
recognize it and, overwhelmingly, these claims are not recognized.

01:16.200 --> 01:21.160
Australia's claim, for example, is only recognized by the United Kingdom, Norway,

01:21.160 --> 01:26.020
France, and New Zealand—countries which clearly have a vested interest in the recognition

01:26.020 --> 01:27.900
of Antarctic claims.

01:27.900 --> 01:30.540
For the most part, these claims are ignored.

01:30.540 --> 01:34.540
One doesn't go through customs upon arrival in the claims and certain of them overlap

01:34.540 --> 01:35.900
with other claims.

01:35.900 --> 01:41.360
The more universally recognized interpretation is that Antarctica is an international zone.

01:41.360 --> 01:45.860
Just like outer space and the ocean, Antarctica is considered part of the common heritage

01:45.860 --> 01:51.840
of mankind meaning that it should be preserved immaculately for all future generations forever.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.160
That's easier said than done.

01:54.160 --> 01:58.920
The seminal piece of legislation regulating the continent is the Antarctic Treaty.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.360
Just as the Cold War was heating up in the late 1950s, the United States, the Soviet

02:03.360 --> 02:07.920
Union, and all other countries with an interest in Antarctica gathered together to decide

02:07.920 --> 02:09.920
how the continent would be used.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.000
They emerged with a future-facing treaty that solved most political disputes and issues

02:14.000 --> 02:16.600
with the continent, except for one.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.620
In its text, the treaty specifically says,

02:18.620 --> 02:22.680
"...nothing contained in the present treaty shall be interpreted as a renunciation by

02:22.680 --> 02:27.480
any contracting party of previously asserted rights of or claims to territorial sovereignty

02:27.480 --> 02:28.480
in Antarctica."

02:28.480 --> 02:33.180
Essentially, they didn't solve the sovereignty issue because it was too difficult to solve,

02:33.180 --> 02:37.600
but they did ban military presence, mining, and nuclear explosions which has helped enormously

02:37.600 --> 02:39.900
in keeping the last continent pristine.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.340
So that brings us to today.

02:42.340 --> 02:47.020
There are no large-scale commercial operations in Antarctica thanks to that treaty.

02:47.020 --> 02:50.300
The vast majority of individuals are there for research.

02:50.300 --> 02:55.500
Of course, living and maintaining a base on the world's most desolate continent is hugely

02:55.500 --> 03:00.600
expensive, but it's worth it for the research that can only be conducted in Antarctica.

03:00.600 --> 03:05.140
Some individuals are there to study the continent itself—its wildlife, its geology, and its

03:05.140 --> 03:09.100
climate—but others use the area to study the entire world.

03:09.100 --> 03:13.100
Base cores can be used to track historic atmospheric carbon levels, underground ponds

03:13.100 --> 03:17.500
can be tapped to find ancient microbial life unique to this area, and ice thickness can

03:17.500 --> 03:20.860
be monitored to understand how sea levels will rise.

03:20.860 --> 03:23.500
Scientists even use Antarctica to look at space.

03:23.500 --> 03:28.500
As such an isolated place, Antarctica has very low background radiation and virtually

03:28.500 --> 03:33.420
no light pollution which allows astronomers to use various techniques to peer into deep

03:33.420 --> 03:34.840
space.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.980
Scientists are performing groundbreaking research in Antarctica, but how do they even

03:38.980 --> 03:40.100
get there?

03:40.100 --> 03:44.180
The difficulty in getting to Antarctica all stems from its weather.

03:44.180 --> 03:49.540
The all-time record high at the South Pole is 9.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

03:49.540 --> 03:53.320
The coasts are significantly warmer where the average summer high is about 30 degrees

03:53.320 --> 03:59.400
Fahrenheit, but still, weather above freezing anywhere in Antarctica is an anomaly.

03:59.400 --> 04:04.560
As mentioned, this means that there is virtually no bare ground—nearly the entire continent

04:04.560 --> 04:07.560
is covered in thick ice and snow.

04:07.560 --> 04:12.480
Therefore, the only real choice when building an Antarctic airstrip is whether to make it

04:12.480 --> 04:14.480
on ice or snow.

04:14.480 --> 04:17.760
One thing to remember is that Antarctica is a desert.

04:17.760 --> 04:22.240
The coastal regions, where most of the research bases are, do experience the most snow but

04:22.240 --> 04:26.220
still then that's a maximum of 8 inches per year.

04:26.220 --> 04:31.480
The South Pole, meanwhile, only sees 2-3 inches of snowfall per year.

04:31.480 --> 04:35.840
It doesn't snow much but when it does, it sticks around for centuries.

04:35.840 --> 04:41.680
Therefore, a runway built on ice or snow is fairly permanent—it doesn't get buried

04:41.680 --> 04:44.200
as one might in Canada or Russia.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.180
McMurdo Station's Pegasus Field, for example, was used for more than 40 years before it

04:49.180 --> 04:53.560
closed in 2016 to be replaced by the new Phoenix Airfield.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.400
Phoenix Airfield is a compacted snow runway.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.280
Machines are used to pack the snow until it's dense enough to support a fully loaded, half-million

05:01.280 --> 05:04.120
pound C-17 wheeled cargo plane.

05:04.120 --> 05:07.760
But compacted snow runways have a disadvantage—they can melt.

05:07.760 --> 05:11.680
During the warmest months of the summer, the snow can warm and soften enough that it is

05:11.680 --> 05:17.000
no longer safe to land wheeled aircraft so that's why there's the other type of runway—blue

05:17.000 --> 05:18.480
ice runways.

05:18.480 --> 05:23.600
These ice runways are built on areas of glacial ice where there's no snow accumulation.

05:23.600 --> 05:29.080
Ice is much more resilient to warmer temperatures so these runways can be used year-round.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.460
Runways on the sea ice are also used typically at the beginning of the summer research season

05:33.460 --> 05:37.600
in early November until December when the southern hemisphere's summer begins and

05:37.600 --> 05:39.320
the ice starts to break up.

05:39.320 --> 05:43.880
Whence the coasts are ice-free, cargo ships can also bring supplies into the major coastal

05:43.880 --> 05:48.980
stations and from there, the internal logistics network gets to work.

05:48.980 --> 05:53.300
Large planes are used to get as much cargo and as many passengers to the continent as

05:53.300 --> 05:55.140
inexpensively as possible.

05:55.140 --> 05:59.540
There are certain airports on other continents that serve as gateways to the Antarctic.

05:59.540 --> 06:05.420
Christchurch New Zealand Airport, for example, sends about 100 flights per year and 5,500

06:05.420 --> 06:10.540
passengers to Antarctica and serves as the staging area for the New Zealand, American,

06:10.540 --> 06:13.420
and Italian Antarctic logistics operations.

06:13.420 --> 06:17.540
From there, it's only a five-hour flight to McMurdo Station—the largest Antarctic

06:17.540 --> 06:18.540
research station.

06:18.540 --> 06:22.940
While Christchurch is the major Antarctic gateway, flights do also leave from Cape Town,

06:22.940 --> 06:25.440
South Africa, and Punta Arenas, Chile.

06:25.440 --> 06:30.140
These larger intercontinental planes typically land at the major blue ice and compacted snow

06:30.140 --> 06:35.300
runways near the coast, but then many of these passengers and much of this cargo needs to

06:35.300 --> 06:36.600
get inland.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.860
The inland research bases tend to be smaller and there are fewer of them, but they are

06:40.860 --> 06:42.580
still significant.

06:42.580 --> 06:48.260
The American Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, for example, has a population of 150 people

06:48.260 --> 06:53.380
in the summer and there are also smaller Italian, French, Russian, Japanese, and German

06:53.380 --> 06:55.300
stations away from the coasts.

06:55.300 --> 07:00.620
For the American Antarctic operations, McMurdo Station operates as the logistics hub.

07:00.620 --> 07:05.620
Nearly all cargo and passengers arrive there on larger cargo planes or cargo ships.

07:05.620 --> 07:10.620
From there, passengers and some cargo are transferred most often onto Lockheed LC-130

07:10.620 --> 07:11.980
planes.

07:11.980 --> 07:16.640
These prop planes are specifically designed for Arctic and Antarctic operations.

07:16.640 --> 07:21.240
They have retractable skis that allow them to land on soft, non-compacted snow and there

07:21.240 --> 07:23.480
are only ten in existence.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.920
Polar operations often mean taking off at high altitudes where the air is thin.

07:27.920 --> 07:32.200
The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where the plane often flies to, for example, is

07:32.200 --> 07:38.400
surprisingly at 9,300 feet above sea level—that's even higher than the highest elevation commercial

07:38.400 --> 07:40.040
airport in the US.

07:40.040 --> 07:44.680
When the air is thin, wings generate less lift so the speed needed to take off is higher

07:44.720 --> 07:51.600
and so, in order to be able to take off at higher elevations, this LC-130 plane has rockets

07:51.600 --> 07:53.960
to help speed it up at takeoff.

07:53.960 --> 07:58.240
Thanks to its skis, this plane can operate to those places like the South Pole Station

07:58.240 --> 08:01.600
that don't have compacted snow or blue ice runways.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.920
While passengers and some cargo like fresh food take the quick two-hour flight from McMurdo

08:05.920 --> 08:09.840
Station to the South Pole, there is another way.

08:09.840 --> 08:14.560
Runways are hugely expensive and the United States Antarctic Program works on a limited

08:14.560 --> 08:18.320
budget so there's an effort being made to reduce shipping costs.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.760
Therefore, they built a road.

08:20.760 --> 08:26.480
Just like the runways, this road is made from compacted snow and stretches 995 miles from

08:26.480 --> 08:29.000
McMurdo Station to the South Pole.

08:29.000 --> 08:33.620
Using this South Pole traverse, the United States Antarctic Program runs convoys of tractors

08:33.620 --> 08:37.160
pulling sleds of cargo across the ice and snow.

08:37.160 --> 08:42.540
This trip takes about 40 days one way, but it still is significantly cheaper than flights

08:42.540 --> 08:47.340
and can handle cargo too large to fit in an LC-130 cargo plane.

08:47.340 --> 08:52.660
Of course, Antarctica is still Antarctica—one of the harshest climates in the world.

08:52.660 --> 08:57.820
Whenever a plane leaves from New Zealand or South Africa or Chile to Antarctica, it's

08:57.820 --> 09:02.560
required to take enough fuel to fly all the way to its destination, attempt landing, and

09:02.560 --> 09:05.760
fly back to its origin if landing is not possible.

09:05.760 --> 09:10.620
Plans fail, equipment breaks, and weather changes so Antarctica just isn't a place

09:10.620 --> 09:12.720
conducive to reliability.

09:12.720 --> 09:17.500
For this reason, planes are prohibited from landing or taking off in the dark and of course,

09:17.500 --> 09:22.020
in the winter in Antarctica, it's dark for 24 hours a day.

09:22.020 --> 09:28.220
Therefore, for seven months out of the year, there are no planes, no boats, no link at

09:28.220 --> 09:31.780
all between Antarctica and the rest of the world.

09:31.800 --> 09:36.520
The lack of transport links during the winter have as much to do with the cold as the dark.

09:36.520 --> 09:40.760
At McMurdo Station, where most ships dock on the coast, the winter temperature rarely

09:40.760 --> 09:45.480
rises above zero degrees Fahrenheit meaning that the coast is blocked with sea ice and

09:45.480 --> 09:52.060
meanwhile at the South Pole Station, the average July high temperature is negative 67 degrees

09:52.060 --> 09:57.660
Fahrenheit meaning that if any plane landed there, its fuel would freeze within minutes.

09:57.660 --> 10:03.020
Of course the large bases, like McMurdo Station which balloons to well over 1,000 residents

10:03.020 --> 10:07.340
in the summer, need maintenance over the winter and some science experiments need to be conducted

10:07.340 --> 10:14.320
year-round so people have to stay in Antarctica—alone, in the dark, for the entire winter, with no

10:14.320 --> 10:16.700
link to the outside world.

10:16.700 --> 10:21.160
In recent years there has been a small number of exceptions to this lack of flights in winter

10:21.160 --> 10:25.860
mostly due to medical evacuation flights but for the most part, when the last plane leaves

10:25.860 --> 10:31.180
in February, everyone still in Antarctica is stuck there until the following November.

10:31.180 --> 10:37.020
All food, fuel, and supplies are stocked there well before and a small number of people—45

10:37.020 --> 10:40.940
in the case of the South Pole Station—stick around to keep the bases running.

10:40.940 --> 10:45.900
In a sense, the people who stay the winter in Antarctica are even more isolated than

10:45.900 --> 10:48.940
the astronauts on the International Space Station.

10:48.940 --> 10:54.140
There are few places humans can go where they are seven months away from medical care, from

10:54.140 --> 10:56.800
food, from civilization.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.340
Those living and working on the last continent endure some of the harshest conditions on

11:01.340 --> 11:06.980
this earth, but for the pursuit of science, all this hardship, all this work, and all

11:06.980 --> 11:10.400
this cost is worth it.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.140
If you want to live and work in Antarctica, your best shot to get there is if you're

11:14.140 --> 11:15.140
a scientist.

11:15.140 --> 11:19.280
In particular, a lot of those working there are astronomers and the best place to get

11:19.280 --> 11:22.820
a basic understanding of astronomy is Brilliant.org.

11:23.340 --> 11:27.460
Brilliant's interactive quizzes teach you by developing your intuition, not by rote

11:27.460 --> 11:28.880
memorization.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.820
With their straightforward explanations and simple graphics, you really learn a lot quickly.

11:33.820 --> 11:38.220
I usually have a blast while taking Brilliant courses—they're designed to be interesting—and

11:38.220 --> 11:42.360
in this astronomy course you can learn things like how to measure the size of the universe,

11:42.360 --> 11:46.660
if life on other planets is possible, and how everything on earth is actually made of

11:46.660 --> 11:48.060
old stars.

11:48.060 --> 11:52.240
