4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:18,220
Antarctica is the earth's coldest, most desolate, most isolated, windiest, driest,

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,280
and southernmost continent.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,180
All but 2% of the landmass is covered in ice thousands of feet thick.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,400
Human eyes did not gaze upon the continent until 1820.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,580
Human feet did not touch Antarctica until 1895.

9
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,260
It is not a place built for humans, but still, thousands of people live there for up to years

10
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,380
on end.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,900
But how do they get there, how do they live there, and how does Antarctica work?

12
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,780
Antarctica has thousands of residents, significant infrastructure, and a large transport network

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,000
and yet it's one of the very few areas of land on earth not part of any country.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,640
Seven countries have made Antarctic claims—Chile, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Norway, Australia,

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,020
France, and New Zealand—but they are exactly that—claims.

16
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,880
The only real gauge of whether a country's territorial claim is real is if other countries

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,200
recognize it and, overwhelmingly, these claims are not recognized.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,160
Australia's claim, for example, is only recognized by the United Kingdom, Norway,

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,020
France, and New Zealand—countries which clearly have a vested interest in the recognition

20
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,900
of Antarctic claims.

21
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,540
For the most part, these claims are ignored.

22
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,540
One doesn't go through customs upon arrival in the claims and certain of them overlap

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,900
with other claims.

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:41,360
The more universally recognized interpretation is that Antarctica is an international zone.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,860
Just like outer space and the ocean, Antarctica is considered part of the common heritage

26
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,840
of mankind meaning that it should be preserved immaculately for all future generations forever.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,160
That's easier said than done.

28
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,920
The seminal piece of legislation regulating the continent is the Antarctic Treaty.

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,360
Just as the Cold War was heating up in the late 1950s, the United States, the Soviet

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,920
Union, and all other countries with an interest in Antarctica gathered together to decide

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
how the continent would be used.

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,000
They emerged with a future-facing treaty that solved most political disputes and issues

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,600
with the continent, except for one.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,620
In its text, the treaty specifically says,

35
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,680
"...nothing contained in the present treaty shall be interpreted as a renunciation by

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,480
any contracting party of previously asserted rights of or claims to territorial sovereignty

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,480
in Antarctica."

38
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,180
Essentially, they didn't solve the sovereignty issue because it was too difficult to solve,

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,600
but they did ban military presence, mining, and nuclear explosions which has helped enormously

40
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,900
in keeping the last continent pristine.

41
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,340
So that brings us to today.

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,020
There are no large-scale commercial operations in Antarctica thanks to that treaty.

43
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,300
The vast majority of individuals are there for research.

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,500
Of course, living and maintaining a base on the world's most desolate continent is hugely

45
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,600
expensive, but it's worth it for the research that can only be conducted in Antarctica.

46
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,140
Some individuals are there to study the continent itself—its wildlife, its geology, and its

47
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,100
climate—but others use the area to study the entire world.

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Base cores can be used to track historic atmospheric carbon levels, underground ponds

49
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,500
can be tapped to find ancient microbial life unique to this area, and ice thickness can

50
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,860
be monitored to understand how sea levels will rise.

51
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,500
Scientists even use Antarctica to look at space.

52
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
As such an isolated place, Antarctica has very low background radiation and virtually

53
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,420
no light pollution which allows astronomers to use various techniques to peer into deep

54
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,840
space.

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,980
Scientists are performing groundbreaking research in Antarctica, but how do they even

56
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,100
get there?

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:44,180
The difficulty in getting to Antarctica all stems from its weather.

58
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:49,540
The all-time record high at the South Pole is 9.9 degrees Fahrenheit.

59
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,320
The coasts are significantly warmer where the average summer high is about 30 degrees

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:59,400
Fahrenheit, but still, weather above freezing anywhere in Antarctica is an anomaly.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,560
As mentioned, this means that there is virtually no bare ground—nearly the entire continent

62
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
is covered in thick ice and snow.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,480
Therefore, the only real choice when building an Antarctic airstrip is whether to make it

64
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,480
on ice or snow.

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,760
One thing to remember is that Antarctica is a desert.

66
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,240
The coastal regions, where most of the research bases are, do experience the most snow but

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,220
still then that's a maximum of 8 inches per year.

68
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,480
The South Pole, meanwhile, only sees 2-3 inches of snowfall per year.

69
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,840
It doesn't snow much but when it does, it sticks around for centuries.

70
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,680
Therefore, a runway built on ice or snow is fairly permanent—it doesn't get buried

71
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,200
as one might in Canada or Russia.

72
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,180
McMurdo Station's Pegasus Field, for example, was used for more than 40 years before it

73
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,560
closed in 2016 to be replaced by the new Phoenix Airfield.

74
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,400
Phoenix Airfield is a compacted snow runway.

75
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Machines are used to pack the snow until it's dense enough to support a fully loaded, half-million

76
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,120
pound C-17 wheeled cargo plane.

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,760
But compacted snow runways have a disadvantage—they can melt.

78
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,680
During the warmest months of the summer, the snow can warm and soften enough that it is

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,000
no longer safe to land wheeled aircraft so that's why there's the other type of runway—blue

80
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,480
ice runways.

81
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,600
These ice runways are built on areas of glacial ice where there's no snow accumulation.

82
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,080
Ice is much more resilient to warmer temperatures so these runways can be used year-round.

83
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,460
Runways on the sea ice are also used typically at the beginning of the summer research season

84
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,600
in early November until December when the southern hemisphere's summer begins and

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,320
the ice starts to break up.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,880
Whence the coasts are ice-free, cargo ships can also bring supplies into the major coastal

87
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,980
stations and from there, the internal logistics network gets to work.

88
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,300
Large planes are used to get as much cargo and as many passengers to the continent as

89
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,140
inexpensively as possible.

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,540
There are certain airports on other continents that serve as gateways to the Antarctic.

91
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,420
Christchurch New Zealand Airport, for example, sends about 100 flights per year and 5,500

92
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,540
passengers to Antarctica and serves as the staging area for the New Zealand, American,

93
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,420
and Italian Antarctic logistics operations.

94
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,540
From there, it's only a five-hour flight to McMurdo Station—the largest Antarctic

95
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
research station.

96
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,940
While Christchurch is the major Antarctic gateway, flights do also leave from Cape Town,

97
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,440
South Africa, and Punta Arenas, Chile.

98
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,140
These larger intercontinental planes typically land at the major blue ice and compacted snow

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,300
runways near the coast, but then many of these passengers and much of this cargo needs to

100
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,600
get inland.

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,860
The inland research bases tend to be smaller and there are fewer of them, but they are

102
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,580
still significant.

103
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:48,260
The American Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, for example, has a population of 150 people

104
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,380
in the summer and there are also smaller Italian, French, Russian, Japanese, and German

105
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,300
stations away from the coasts.

106
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,620
For the American Antarctic operations, McMurdo Station operates as the logistics hub.

107
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Nearly all cargo and passengers arrive there on larger cargo planes or cargo ships.

108
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,620
From there, passengers and some cargo are transferred most often onto Lockheed LC-130

109
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,980
planes.

110
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,640
These prop planes are specifically designed for Arctic and Antarctic operations.

111
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,240
They have retractable skis that allow them to land on soft, non-compacted snow and there

112
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,480
are only ten in existence.

113
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,920
Polar operations often mean taking off at high altitudes where the air is thin.

114
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,200
The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where the plane often flies to, for example, is

115
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,400
surprisingly at 9,300 feet above sea level—that's even higher than the highest elevation commercial

116
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,040
airport in the US.

117
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:44,680
When the air is thin, wings generate less lift so the speed needed to take off is higher

118
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,600
and so, in order to be able to take off at higher elevations, this LC-130 plane has rockets

119
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,960
to help speed it up at takeoff.

120
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,240
Thanks to its skis, this plane can operate to those places like the South Pole Station

121
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,600
that don't have compacted snow or blue ice runways.

122
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,920
While passengers and some cargo like fresh food take the quick two-hour flight from McMurdo

123
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,840
Station to the South Pole, there is another way.

124
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
Runways are hugely expensive and the United States Antarctic Program works on a limited

125
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,320
budget so there's an effort being made to reduce shipping costs.

126
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,760
Therefore, they built a road.

127
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,480
Just like the runways, this road is made from compacted snow and stretches 995 miles from

128
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,000
McMurdo Station to the South Pole.

129
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,620
Using this South Pole traverse, the United States Antarctic Program runs convoys of tractors

130
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,160
pulling sleds of cargo across the ice and snow.

131
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,540
This trip takes about 40 days one way, but it still is significantly cheaper than flights

132
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:47,340
and can handle cargo too large to fit in an LC-130 cargo plane.

133
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,660
Of course, Antarctica is still Antarctica—one of the harshest climates in the world.

134
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,820
Whenever a plane leaves from New Zealand or South Africa or Chile to Antarctica, it's

135
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,560
required to take enough fuel to fly all the way to its destination, attempt landing, and

136
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
fly back to its origin if landing is not possible.

137
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,620
Plans fail, equipment breaks, and weather changes so Antarctica just isn't a place

138
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,720
conducive to reliability.

139
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,500
For this reason, planes are prohibited from landing or taking off in the dark and of course,

140
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,020
in the winter in Antarctica, it's dark for 24 hours a day.

141
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:28,220
Therefore, for seven months out of the year, there are no planes, no boats, no link at

142
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,780
all between Antarctica and the rest of the world.

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,520
The lack of transport links during the winter have as much to do with the cold as the dark.

144
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:40,760
At McMurdo Station, where most ships dock on the coast, the winter temperature rarely

145
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,480
rises above zero degrees Fahrenheit meaning that the coast is blocked with sea ice and

146
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,060
meanwhile at the South Pole Station, the average July high temperature is negative 67 degrees

147
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,660
Fahrenheit meaning that if any plane landed there, its fuel would freeze within minutes.

148
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:03,020
Of course the large bases, like McMurdo Station which balloons to well over 1,000 residents

149
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,340
in the summer, need maintenance over the winter and some science experiments need to be conducted

150
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:14,320
year-round so people have to stay in Antarctica—alone, in the dark, for the entire winter, with no

151
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,700
link to the outside world.

152
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,160
In recent years there has been a small number of exceptions to this lack of flights in winter

153
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,860
mostly due to medical evacuation flights but for the most part, when the last plane leaves

154
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,180
in February, everyone still in Antarctica is stuck there until the following November.

155
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:37,020
All food, fuel, and supplies are stocked there well before and a small number of people—45

156
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,940
in the case of the South Pole Station—stick around to keep the bases running.

157
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,900
In a sense, the people who stay the winter in Antarctica are even more isolated than

158
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,940
the astronauts on the International Space Station.

159
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,140
There are few places humans can go where they are seven months away from medical care, from

160
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,800
food, from civilization.

161
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,340
Those living and working on the last continent endure some of the harshest conditions on

162
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,980
this earth, but for the pursuit of science, all this hardship, all this work, and all

163
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:10,400
this cost is worth it.

164
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,140
If you want to live and work in Antarctica, your best shot to get there is if you're

165
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,140
a scientist.

166
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,280
In particular, a lot of those working there are astronomers and the best place to get

167
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,820
a basic understanding of astronomy is Brilliant.org.

168
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,460
Brilliant's interactive quizzes teach you by developing your intuition, not by rote

169
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,880
memorization.

170
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,820
With their straightforward explanations and simple graphics, you really learn a lot quickly.

171
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:38,220
I usually have a blast while taking Brilliant courses—they're designed to be interesting—and

172
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,360
in this astronomy course you can learn things like how to measure the size of the universe,

173
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,660
if life on other planets is possible, and how everything on earth is actually made of

174
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,060
old stars.

175
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,240
By going to brilliant.org slash wendover, you can get started for free and then, by

176
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,380

177
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,040
