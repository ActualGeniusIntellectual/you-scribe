11100	18220	Antarctica is the earth's coldest, most desolate, most isolated, windiest, driest,
18220	20280	and southernmost continent.
20280	25180	All but 2% of the landmass is covered in ice thousands of feet thick.
25180	29400	Human eyes did not gaze upon the continent until 1820.
29400	33580	Human feet did not touch Antarctica until 1895.
33580	39260	It is not a place built for humans, but still, thousands of people live there for up to years
39260	40380	on end.
40380	45900	But how do they get there, how do they live there, and how does Antarctica work?
45900	50780	Antarctica has thousands of residents, significant infrastructure, and a large transport network
50780	56000	and yet it's one of the very few areas of land on earth not part of any country.
56140	62640	Seven countries have made Antarctic claims—Chile, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Norway, Australia,
62640	67020	France, and New Zealand—but they are exactly that—claims.
67020	71880	The only real gauge of whether a country's territorial claim is real is if other countries
71880	76200	recognize it and, overwhelmingly, these claims are not recognized.
76200	81160	Australia's claim, for example, is only recognized by the United Kingdom, Norway,
81160	86020	France, and New Zealand—countries which clearly have a vested interest in the recognition
86020	87900	of Antarctic claims.
87900	90540	For the most part, these claims are ignored.
90540	94540	One doesn't go through customs upon arrival in the claims and certain of them overlap
94540	95900	with other claims.
95900	101360	The more universally recognized interpretation is that Antarctica is an international zone.
101360	105860	Just like outer space and the ocean, Antarctica is considered part of the common heritage
105860	111840	of mankind meaning that it should be preserved immaculately for all future generations forever.
111840	114160	That's easier said than done.
114160	118920	The seminal piece of legislation regulating the continent is the Antarctic Treaty.
118920	123360	Just as the Cold War was heating up in the late 1950s, the United States, the Soviet
123360	127920	Union, and all other countries with an interest in Antarctica gathered together to decide
127920	129920	how the continent would be used.
129920	134000	They emerged with a future-facing treaty that solved most political disputes and issues
134000	136600	with the continent, except for one.
136600	138620	In its text, the treaty specifically says,
138620	142680	"...nothing contained in the present treaty shall be interpreted as a renunciation by
142680	147480	any contracting party of previously asserted rights of or claims to territorial sovereignty
147480	148480	in Antarctica."
148480	153180	Essentially, they didn't solve the sovereignty issue because it was too difficult to solve,
153180	157600	but they did ban military presence, mining, and nuclear explosions which has helped enormously
157600	159900	in keeping the last continent pristine.
159900	162340	So that brings us to today.
162340	167020	There are no large-scale commercial operations in Antarctica thanks to that treaty.
167020	170300	The vast majority of individuals are there for research.
170300	175500	Of course, living and maintaining a base on the world's most desolate continent is hugely
175500	180600	expensive, but it's worth it for the research that can only be conducted in Antarctica.
180600	185140	Some individuals are there to study the continent itself—its wildlife, its geology, and its
185140	189100	climate—but others use the area to study the entire world.
189100	193100	Base cores can be used to track historic atmospheric carbon levels, underground ponds
193100	197500	can be tapped to find ancient microbial life unique to this area, and ice thickness can
197500	200860	be monitored to understand how sea levels will rise.
200860	203500	Scientists even use Antarctica to look at space.
203500	208500	As such an isolated place, Antarctica has very low background radiation and virtually
208500	213420	no light pollution which allows astronomers to use various techniques to peer into deep
213420	214840	space.
214840	218980	Scientists are performing groundbreaking research in Antarctica, but how do they even
218980	220100	get there?
220100	224180	The difficulty in getting to Antarctica all stems from its weather.
224180	229540	The all-time record high at the South Pole is 9.9 degrees Fahrenheit.
229540	233320	The coasts are significantly warmer where the average summer high is about 30 degrees
233320	239400	Fahrenheit, but still, weather above freezing anywhere in Antarctica is an anomaly.
239400	244560	As mentioned, this means that there is virtually no bare ground—nearly the entire continent
244560	247560	is covered in thick ice and snow.
247560	252480	Therefore, the only real choice when building an Antarctic airstrip is whether to make it
252480	254480	on ice or snow.
254480	257760	One thing to remember is that Antarctica is a desert.
257760	262240	The coastal regions, where most of the research bases are, do experience the most snow but
262240	266220	still then that's a maximum of 8 inches per year.
266220	271480	The South Pole, meanwhile, only sees 2-3 inches of snowfall per year.
271480	275840	It doesn't snow much but when it does, it sticks around for centuries.
275840	281680	Therefore, a runway built on ice or snow is fairly permanent—it doesn't get buried
281680	284200	as one might in Canada or Russia.
284200	289180	McMurdo Station's Pegasus Field, for example, was used for more than 40 years before it
289180	293560	closed in 2016 to be replaced by the new Phoenix Airfield.
293560	296400	Phoenix Airfield is a compacted snow runway.
296400	301280	Machines are used to pack the snow until it's dense enough to support a fully loaded, half-million
301280	304120	pound C-17 wheeled cargo plane.
304120	307760	But compacted snow runways have a disadvantage—they can melt.
307760	311680	During the warmest months of the summer, the snow can warm and soften enough that it is
311680	317000	no longer safe to land wheeled aircraft so that's why there's the other type of runway—blue
317000	318480	ice runways.
318480	323600	These ice runways are built on areas of glacial ice where there's no snow accumulation.
323600	329080	Ice is much more resilient to warmer temperatures so these runways can be used year-round.
329080	333460	Runways on the sea ice are also used typically at the beginning of the summer research season
333460	337600	in early November until December when the southern hemisphere's summer begins and
337600	339320	the ice starts to break up.
339320	343880	Whence the coasts are ice-free, cargo ships can also bring supplies into the major coastal
343880	348980	stations and from there, the internal logistics network gets to work.
348980	353300	Large planes are used to get as much cargo and as many passengers to the continent as
353300	355140	inexpensively as possible.
355140	359540	There are certain airports on other continents that serve as gateways to the Antarctic.
359540	365420	Christchurch New Zealand Airport, for example, sends about 100 flights per year and 5,500
365420	370540	passengers to Antarctica and serves as the staging area for the New Zealand, American,
370540	373420	and Italian Antarctic logistics operations.
373420	377540	From there, it's only a five-hour flight to McMurdo Station—the largest Antarctic
377540	378540	research station.
378540	382940	While Christchurch is the major Antarctic gateway, flights do also leave from Cape Town,
382940	385440	South Africa, and Punta Arenas, Chile.
385440	390140	These larger intercontinental planes typically land at the major blue ice and compacted snow
390140	395300	runways near the coast, but then many of these passengers and much of this cargo needs to
395300	396600	get inland.
396600	400860	The inland research bases tend to be smaller and there are fewer of them, but they are
400860	402580	still significant.
402580	408260	The American Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, for example, has a population of 150 people
408260	413380	in the summer and there are also smaller Italian, French, Russian, Japanese, and German
413380	415300	stations away from the coasts.
415300	420620	For the American Antarctic operations, McMurdo Station operates as the logistics hub.
420620	425620	Nearly all cargo and passengers arrive there on larger cargo planes or cargo ships.
425620	430620	From there, passengers and some cargo are transferred most often onto Lockheed LC-130
430620	431980	planes.
431980	436640	These prop planes are specifically designed for Arctic and Antarctic operations.
436640	441240	They have retractable skis that allow them to land on soft, non-compacted snow and there
441240	443480	are only ten in existence.
443480	447920	Polar operations often mean taking off at high altitudes where the air is thin.
447920	452200	The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where the plane often flies to, for example, is
452200	458400	surprisingly at 9,300 feet above sea level—that's even higher than the highest elevation commercial
458400	460040	airport in the US.
460040	464680	When the air is thin, wings generate less lift so the speed needed to take off is higher
464720	471600	and so, in order to be able to take off at higher elevations, this LC-130 plane has rockets
471600	473960	to help speed it up at takeoff.
473960	478240	Thanks to its skis, this plane can operate to those places like the South Pole Station
478240	481600	that don't have compacted snow or blue ice runways.
481600	485920	While passengers and some cargo like fresh food take the quick two-hour flight from McMurdo
485920	489840	Station to the South Pole, there is another way.
489840	494560	Runways are hugely expensive and the United States Antarctic Program works on a limited
494560	498320	budget so there's an effort being made to reduce shipping costs.
498320	500760	Therefore, they built a road.
500760	506480	Just like the runways, this road is made from compacted snow and stretches 995 miles from
506480	509000	McMurdo Station to the South Pole.
509000	513620	Using this South Pole traverse, the United States Antarctic Program runs convoys of tractors
513620	517160	pulling sleds of cargo across the ice and snow.
517160	522540	This trip takes about 40 days one way, but it still is significantly cheaper than flights
522540	527340	and can handle cargo too large to fit in an LC-130 cargo plane.
527340	532660	Of course, Antarctica is still Antarctica—one of the harshest climates in the world.
532660	537820	Whenever a plane leaves from New Zealand or South Africa or Chile to Antarctica, it's
537820	542560	required to take enough fuel to fly all the way to its destination, attempt landing, and
542560	545760	fly back to its origin if landing is not possible.
545760	550620	Plans fail, equipment breaks, and weather changes so Antarctica just isn't a place
550620	552720	conducive to reliability.
552720	557500	For this reason, planes are prohibited from landing or taking off in the dark and of course,
557500	562020	in the winter in Antarctica, it's dark for 24 hours a day.
562020	568220	Therefore, for seven months out of the year, there are no planes, no boats, no link at
568220	571780	all between Antarctica and the rest of the world.
571800	576520	The lack of transport links during the winter have as much to do with the cold as the dark.
576520	580760	At McMurdo Station, where most ships dock on the coast, the winter temperature rarely
580760	585480	rises above zero degrees Fahrenheit meaning that the coast is blocked with sea ice and
585480	592060	meanwhile at the South Pole Station, the average July high temperature is negative 67 degrees
592060	597660	Fahrenheit meaning that if any plane landed there, its fuel would freeze within minutes.
597660	603020	Of course the large bases, like McMurdo Station which balloons to well over 1,000 residents
603020	607340	in the summer, need maintenance over the winter and some science experiments need to be conducted
607340	614320	year-round so people have to stay in Antarctica—alone, in the dark, for the entire winter, with no
614320	616700	link to the outside world.
616700	621160	In recent years there has been a small number of exceptions to this lack of flights in winter
621160	625860	mostly due to medical evacuation flights but for the most part, when the last plane leaves
625860	631180	in February, everyone still in Antarctica is stuck there until the following November.
631180	637020	All food, fuel, and supplies are stocked there well before and a small number of people—45
637020	640940	in the case of the South Pole Station—stick around to keep the bases running.
640940	645900	In a sense, the people who stay the winter in Antarctica are even more isolated than
645900	648940	the astronauts on the International Space Station.
648940	654140	There are few places humans can go where they are seven months away from medical care, from
654140	656800	food, from civilization.
656800	661340	Those living and working on the last continent endure some of the harshest conditions on
661340	666980	this earth, but for the pursuit of science, all this hardship, all this work, and all
666980	670400	this cost is worth it.
670400	674140	If you want to live and work in Antarctica, your best shot to get there is if you're
674140	675140	a scientist.
675140	679280	In particular, a lot of those working there are astronomers and the best place to get
679280	682820	a basic understanding of astronomy is Brilliant.org.
683340	687460	Brilliant's interactive quizzes teach you by developing your intuition, not by rote
687460	688880	memorization.
688880	693820	With their straightforward explanations and simple graphics, you really learn a lot quickly.
693820	698220	I usually have a blast while taking Brilliant courses—they're designed to be interesting—and
698220	702360	in this astronomy course you can learn things like how to measure the size of the universe,
702360	706660	if life on other planets is possible, and how everything on earth is actually made of
706660	708060	old stars.
