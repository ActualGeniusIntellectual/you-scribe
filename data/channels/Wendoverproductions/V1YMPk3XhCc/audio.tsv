8320	12280	The commercial airline industry is the classic duopoly.
12280	17780	In the US there's Boeing, the long successful manufacturer most known for its iconic 747
17780	22000	and in Europe there's Airbus, the more recent entrant formed of a consortium of various
22000	25120	European manufacturers, and that's pretty much it.
25120	29920	Two-thirds of all airplanes currently flying commercially are made by one of these two
29920	34040	manufacturers, but there's something that these manufacturers don't do—they don't
34040	36960	make small planes, but that's not for lack of trying.
36960	41500	Airbus tried when they made their A318, a variant of their successful A320, but only
41500	42920	sold 80 of them.
42920	49240	Boeing did as well with their 717 but it too was a commercial failure with only 156 sales,
49240	52320	but that doesn't mean that there's no place for small planes.
52320	56920	In fact, it's a significant market that the giants of the aviation industry have not
56920	58280	been able to touch.
58280	62160	If you step on a plane to a small airport nowadays there's a good chance that it's
62160	64520	either made by Embraer or Bombardier.
64520	69620	Embraer, the Brazilian manufacturer, launched their Ejet family just over 15 years ago and
69620	72960	to date have sold nearly 1,500 of them.
72960	77240	By all accounts it's a fantastic airplane and there are whole airports that rely on
77240	78240	them.
78280	83640	70% of the more than 100 daily flights out of the small London city airport operate using
83640	84640	an Embraer Ejet.
84640	89200	Due to the noise restrictions, steep approach angle, and short runway, this is one of the
89200	93960	few planes that can operate there and some airlines such as British Airways own the Ejet
93960	96920	exclusively for use at this airport.
96920	102860	The US, with its nearly 400 commercial airports and vast size, has service to many more smaller
102860	108200	airports than Europe or Asia thanks to government subsidies so hundreds of airports in the US
108200	110920	are served by non-Boeing or Airbus jets.
110920	115640	There's a serious place for small planes and Bombardier knows this.
115640	119800	Bombardier, while still one of Canada's largest companies, is a small player in the
119800	124800	commercial airplane market only making about 6% of the world's commercial planes.
124800	129720	The company has long made the successful CRJ regional jets but 10 years ago Bombardier
129720	132000	had an idea for something else.
132000	136600	They were going to make a larger, more efficient airplane to fit between the size of small
136600	141280	regional jets and the larger planes of Boeing and Airbus—the C-Series.
141280	146200	This plane was going to take advantage of all the modern advancements in aircraft design—composite
146200	151120	construction, advanced aerodynamics, and high-bypass engines—to make one of the most efficient
151120	153160	small airplanes on the market.
153160	158320	From 2007 onwards the parts were selected, the plane was developed, and sales were booked.
158320	163560	Then, on September 16th, 2013, it took flight for the first time.
163560	167800	At this point the company was adamant that the aircraft would enter into commercial service
167800	172560	just one year later in 2014, but then the problems began.
172560	177060	While doing routine testing on the ground at the Mirabel Airport manufacturing base,
177060	180780	one of the test aircraft suffered an uncontained engine failure.
180780	184880	Not only did this strike a serious blow to the aircraft development timeline, it also
184880	189680	prevented the manufacturer from exhibiting their new plane at the Farnborough Airshow—the
189680	193280	largest and most important trade show in the industry where the company expected to
193280	195780	secure crucial aircraft orders.
195780	200660	The show only happens every two years so this was a significant setback.
200660	205380	Some questioned whether the program could survive this blow, and it only barely did.
205380	208840	The program was nearly out of money in 2015.
208840	213440	Without the significant financial support of the governments of Canada and Quebec, the
213440	219160	program and company likely would not have survived, but it did and on June 15th, 2016,
219160	224220	the aircraft entered service with Swiss Airlines on its first ever commercial flight from Zurich
224220	225340	to Paris.
225340	228820	By all accounts the C-Series is a fantastic airplane.
228820	233040	For airlines it's efficient and versatile while passengers praise its rare level of
233040	235240	passenger comfort for a small plane.
235240	241300	It even has a range of up to 3,800 miles meaning it could hypothetically fly transatlantic into
241300	244940	small airports like London and Belfast city airports.
244940	250800	As of October 2017, there are 14 C-Series planes currently flying—9 for Swiss Airlines
250800	257480	and 5 for Air Baltic—but they have nearly 350 orders, enough to make the program profitable,
257480	262480	but until recently they lacked the most valuable kind of order—American ones.
262480	267800	With its tendency to use smaller planes, the American market will make or break the program,
267800	269600	and Bombardier knew this.
269600	273720	They were desperate for an order from one of the main three US airlines to prove its
273720	280680	viability so much so that they allegedly sold 75 of them to Delta for only $20 million
280680	284460	each—a quarter of the $80 million list price.
284460	289900	That was an amazing price for Delta, but it was low enough that it might have been illegal.
289900	291900	This is a practice known as dumping.
291900	297260	The cost for Bombardier to make a C-Series plane is about $30 million so it was selling
297260	301580	these planes that they hadn't even made yet at a loss because they wanted to gain
301580	303600	prevalence in the US market.
303600	308640	Predatory pricing techniques like this are against the law in the US and many other countries
308640	313680	so Boeing took action and filed a dumping petition with the US Department of Commerce.
313680	318160	But here's the problem—Boeing doesn't make an equivalent airplane to the C-Series.
318160	323620	They say that the dumping will curtail the sale of its smaller 737-700 planes but Delta
323620	327200	itself has said that they didn't want the 737s.
327200	333260	Boeing couldn't offer them a delivery slot before 2020 and the 737 is a fundamentally
333260	334260	different plane.
334260	339100	The C-Series has better range, can take off from a shorter runway, is more efficient,
339100	341900	and is empirically a smaller airplane.
341900	346700	Boeing claims that Bombardier received subsidies that allowed for the below market pricing,
346700	351060	but the money Bombardier received from the governments of Quebec and Canada came in either
351060	355160	exchange for ownership of the program or in the form of interest-free loans that will
355160	356540	be paid back.
356540	362440	Boeing, on the other hand, has received over $14 billion in subsidies in the last 20 years
362440	365760	through tax breaks from US state and federal governments.
365760	370560	Nonetheless, Boeing asked the US Department of Commerce to impose an 80% tariff on the
370560	373680	plane to bring the price above the manufacturing cost.
373680	379000	The US Department of Commerce responded by placing a 300% tariff on the plane.
379000	382480	At this point it seemed like the end of the line for the Bombardier plane.
382480	387500	With a tariff that high, it could never be both competitive and profitable in the crucial
387500	388860	US market.
388860	390380	But then Airbus stepped in.
390380	397260	On October 16th, 2017, the two companies announced that Airbus would be acquiring a 50.01% stake
397260	398660	in the C-Series program.
398660	402980	Bombardier is just giving away this stake for free, but the reason this is so great
402980	407860	for them is, for one, Airbus is a marketing and sales powerhouse.
407860	412180	Their resources far outstrip those of Bombardier and they will be able to sail more planes
412180	414600	than Bombardier could ever have dreamt of.
414600	420340	On the other side, since the C-Series doesn't really overlap in size with any Airbus plane,
420340	424900	Airbus gains a new modern airplane in their lineup that will allow airlines to have truly
424900	426340	all Airbus fleets.
426340	431480	But the real reason Bombardier partnered up with Airbus is because of this—Airbus'
431480	433780	final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.
433780	438520	By assembling the C-Series aircraft in the US, they'll essentially be American planes
438520	441820	which means that they won't be subject to US import tariffs.
441820	443740	At least according to Bombardier.
443740	447260	Boeing believes that they will still be subject to the tariffs since they're still the same
447260	452500	planes that receive subsidies while some external observers have suggested that only the 48%
452500	456700	of the plane manufactured outside of the US will be subject to the 300% tariff.
456700	460460	What will actually happen is up to the US Department of Commerce.
460460	464640	Independent analysts have estimated that over the next 20 years there will be a demand for
464640	469140	about 5,500 aircraft of the C-Series' size.
469140	474260	Before the Airbus takeover, Bombardier was expected to fulfill 40% of that demand—just
474260	475840	over 2,000 planes.
475840	481580	After the takeover, the C-Series is expected to capture up to 60% of that market—well
481580	483060	over 3,000 planes.
483060	488500	That's tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue and the C-Series now has real potential
488500	490900	to become an iconic airplane.
490900	495060	While it would have been hard to predict this turn of events, this takeover, directly brought
495060	499260	on by Boeing's actions, proves a hard-hitting blow to the company.
499260	504280	Without spending a cent on development, Airbus now has a plane in a market segment that Boeing
504280	505720	cannot compete with.
505720	510940	The C-Series will dominate this market segment and every cent Airbus and Bombardier makes
510940	513160	is money lost on Boeing's part.
513160	518340	Just as Boeing expected, the C-Series will hurt its business in the US, but now it'll
518340	521580	happen with a fully legal, American-made plane.
