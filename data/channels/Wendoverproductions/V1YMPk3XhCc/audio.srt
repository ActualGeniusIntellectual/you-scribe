3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,280
The commercial airline industry is the classic duopoly.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,780
In the US there's Boeing, the long successful manufacturer most known for its iconic 747

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:22,000
and in Europe there's Airbus, the more recent entrant formed of a consortium of various

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,120
European manufacturers, and that's pretty much it.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,920
Two-thirds of all airplanes currently flying commercially are made by one of these two

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,040
manufacturers, but there's something that these manufacturers don't do—they don't

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,960
make small planes, but that's not for lack of trying.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,500
Airbus tried when they made their A318, a variant of their successful A320, but only

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,920
sold 80 of them.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,240
Boeing did as well with their 717 but it too was a commercial failure with only 156 sales,

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,320
but that doesn't mean that there's no place for small planes.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,920
In fact, it's a significant market that the giants of the aviation industry have not

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,280
been able to touch.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,160
If you step on a plane to a small airport nowadays there's a good chance that it's

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,520
either made by Embraer or Bombardier.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:09,620
Embraer, the Brazilian manufacturer, launched their Ejet family just over 15 years ago and

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,960
to date have sold nearly 1,500 of them.

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,240
By all accounts it's a fantastic airplane and there are whole airports that rely on

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
them.

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,640
70% of the more than 100 daily flights out of the small London city airport operate using

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
an Embraer Ejet.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,200
Due to the noise restrictions, steep approach angle, and short runway, this is one of the

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,960
few planes that can operate there and some airlines such as British Airways own the Ejet

26
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,920
exclusively for use at this airport.

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,860
The US, with its nearly 400 commercial airports and vast size, has service to many more smaller

28
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,200
airports than Europe or Asia thanks to government subsidies so hundreds of airports in the US

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,920
are served by non-Boeing or Airbus jets.

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,640
There's a serious place for small planes and Bombardier knows this.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,800
Bombardier, while still one of Canada's largest companies, is a small player in the

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,800
commercial airplane market only making about 6% of the world's commercial planes.

33
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,720
The company has long made the successful CRJ regional jets but 10 years ago Bombardier

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,000
had an idea for something else.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,600
They were going to make a larger, more efficient airplane to fit between the size of small

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,280
regional jets and the larger planes of Boeing and Airbus—the C-Series.

37
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,200
This plane was going to take advantage of all the modern advancements in aircraft design—composite

38
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,120
construction, advanced aerodynamics, and high-bypass engines—to make one of the most efficient

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,160
small airplanes on the market.

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,320
From 2007 onwards the parts were selected, the plane was developed, and sales were booked.

41
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,560
Then, on September 16th, 2013, it took flight for the first time.

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,800
At this point the company was adamant that the aircraft would enter into commercial service

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,560
just one year later in 2014, but then the problems began.

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,060
While doing routine testing on the ground at the Mirabel Airport manufacturing base,

45
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,780
one of the test aircraft suffered an uncontained engine failure.

46
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,880
Not only did this strike a serious blow to the aircraft development timeline, it also

47
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,680
prevented the manufacturer from exhibiting their new plane at the Farnborough Airshow—the

48
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,280
largest and most important trade show in the industry where the company expected to

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,780
secure crucial aircraft orders.

50
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,660
The show only happens every two years so this was a significant setback.

51
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,380
Some questioned whether the program could survive this blow, and it only barely did.

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,840
The program was nearly out of money in 2015.

53
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,440
Without the significant financial support of the governments of Canada and Quebec, the

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,160
program and company likely would not have survived, but it did and on June 15th, 2016,

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,220
the aircraft entered service with Swiss Airlines on its first ever commercial flight from Zurich

56
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,340
to Paris.

57
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,820
By all accounts the C-Series is a fantastic airplane.

58
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,040
For airlines it's efficient and versatile while passengers praise its rare level of

59
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,240
passenger comfort for a small plane.

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:01,300
It even has a range of up to 3,800 miles meaning it could hypothetically fly transatlantic into

61
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,940
small airports like London and Belfast city airports.

62
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,800
As of October 2017, there are 14 C-Series planes currently flying—9 for Swiss Airlines

63
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,480
and 5 for Air Baltic—but they have nearly 350 orders, enough to make the program profitable,

64
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,480
but until recently they lacked the most valuable kind of order—American ones.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,800
With its tendency to use smaller planes, the American market will make or break the program,

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,600
and Bombardier knew this.

67
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,720
They were desperate for an order from one of the main three US airlines to prove its

68
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,680
viability so much so that they allegedly sold 75 of them to Delta for only $20 million

69
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,460
each—a quarter of the $80 million list price.

70
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,900
That was an amazing price for Delta, but it was low enough that it might have been illegal.

71
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
This is a practice known as dumping.

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,260
The cost for Bombardier to make a C-Series plane is about $30 million so it was selling

73
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,580
these planes that they hadn't even made yet at a loss because they wanted to gain

74
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,600
prevalence in the US market.

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,640
Predatory pricing techniques like this are against the law in the US and many other countries

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,680
so Boeing took action and filed a dumping petition with the US Department of Commerce.

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,160
But here's the problem—Boeing doesn't make an equivalent airplane to the C-Series.

78
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,620
They say that the dumping will curtail the sale of its smaller 737-700 planes but Delta

79
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,200
itself has said that they didn't want the 737s.

80
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,260
Boeing couldn't offer them a delivery slot before 2020 and the 737 is a fundamentally

81
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
different plane.

82
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,100
The C-Series has better range, can take off from a shorter runway, is more efficient,

83
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,900
and is empirically a smaller airplane.

84
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,700
Boeing claims that Bombardier received subsidies that allowed for the below market pricing,

85
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,060
but the money Bombardier received from the governments of Quebec and Canada came in either

86
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,160
exchange for ownership of the program or in the form of interest-free loans that will

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,540
be paid back.

88
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,440
Boeing, on the other hand, has received over $14 billion in subsidies in the last 20 years

89
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,760
through tax breaks from US state and federal governments.

90
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Nonetheless, Boeing asked the US Department of Commerce to impose an 80% tariff on the

91
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,680
plane to bring the price above the manufacturing cost.

92
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,000
The US Department of Commerce responded by placing a 300% tariff on the plane.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,480
At this point it seemed like the end of the line for the Bombardier plane.

94
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,500
With a tariff that high, it could never be both competitive and profitable in the crucial

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,860
US market.

96
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,380
But then Airbus stepped in.

97
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,260
On October 16th, 2017, the two companies announced that Airbus would be acquiring a 50.01% stake

98
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,660
in the C-Series program.

99
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,980
Bombardier is just giving away this stake for free, but the reason this is so great

100
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,860
for them is, for one, Airbus is a marketing and sales powerhouse.

101
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,180
Their resources far outstrip those of Bombardier and they will be able to sail more planes

102
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,600
than Bombardier could ever have dreamt of.

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,340
On the other side, since the C-Series doesn't really overlap in size with any Airbus plane,

104
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,900
Airbus gains a new modern airplane in their lineup that will allow airlines to have truly

105
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,340
all Airbus fleets.

106
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,480
But the real reason Bombardier partnered up with Airbus is because of this—Airbus'

107
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,780
final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

108
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,520
By assembling the C-Series aircraft in the US, they'll essentially be American planes

109
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,820
which means that they won't be subject to US import tariffs.

110
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,740
At least according to Bombardier.

111
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,260
Boeing believes that they will still be subject to the tariffs since they're still the same

112
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,500
planes that receive subsidies while some external observers have suggested that only the 48%

113
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,700
of the plane manufactured outside of the US will be subject to the 300% tariff.

114
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,460
What will actually happen is up to the US Department of Commerce.

115
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,640
Independent analysts have estimated that over the next 20 years there will be a demand for

116
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,140
about 5,500 aircraft of the C-Series' size.

117
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:54,260
Before the Airbus takeover, Bombardier was expected to fulfill 40% of that demand—just

118
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,840
over 2,000 planes.

119
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,580
After the takeover, the C-Series is expected to capture up to 60% of that market—well

120
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,060
over 3,000 planes.

121
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,500
That's tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue and the C-Series now has real potential

122
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,900
to become an iconic airplane.

123
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:15,060
While it would have been hard to predict this turn of events, this takeover, directly brought

124
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,260
on by Boeing's actions, proves a hard-hitting blow to the company.

125
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,280
Without spending a cent on development, Airbus now has a plane in a market segment that Boeing

126
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,720
cannot compete with.

127
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,940
The C-Series will dominate this market segment and every cent Airbus and Bombardier makes

128
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,160
is money lost on Boeing's part.

129
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:38,340
Just as Boeing expected, the C-Series will hurt its business in the US, but now it'll

130
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:41,580
happen with a fully legal, American-made plane.

131
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,280
If you have a business, a YouTube channel, a podcast, an event, or anything else, you

132
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,280
need a website and there's nowhere better to build it than Squarespace.

133
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:55,020
I made all my websites with Squarespace because their website builder and customizable templates

134
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,960
