00:08.320 --> 00:12.280
The commercial airline industry is the classic duopoly.

00:12.280 --> 00:17.780
In the US there's Boeing, the long successful manufacturer most known for its iconic 747

00:17.780 --> 00:22.000
and in Europe there's Airbus, the more recent entrant formed of a consortium of various

00:22.000 --> 00:25.120
European manufacturers, and that's pretty much it.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.920
Two-thirds of all airplanes currently flying commercially are made by one of these two

00:29.920 --> 00:34.040
manufacturers, but there's something that these manufacturers don't do—they don't

00:34.040 --> 00:36.960
make small planes, but that's not for lack of trying.

00:36.960 --> 00:41.500
Airbus tried when they made their A318, a variant of their successful A320, but only

00:41.500 --> 00:42.920
sold 80 of them.

00:42.920 --> 00:49.240
Boeing did as well with their 717 but it too was a commercial failure with only 156 sales,

00:49.240 --> 00:52.320
but that doesn't mean that there's no place for small planes.

00:52.320 --> 00:56.920
In fact, it's a significant market that the giants of the aviation industry have not

00:56.920 --> 00:58.280
been able to touch.

00:58.280 --> 01:02.160
If you step on a plane to a small airport nowadays there's a good chance that it's

01:02.160 --> 01:04.520
either made by Embraer or Bombardier.

01:04.520 --> 01:09.620
Embraer, the Brazilian manufacturer, launched their Ejet family just over 15 years ago and

01:09.620 --> 01:12.960
to date have sold nearly 1,500 of them.

01:12.960 --> 01:17.240
By all accounts it's a fantastic airplane and there are whole airports that rely on

01:17.240 --> 01:18.240
them.

01:18.280 --> 01:23.640
70% of the more than 100 daily flights out of the small London city airport operate using

01:23.640 --> 01:24.640
an Embraer Ejet.

01:24.640 --> 01:29.200
Due to the noise restrictions, steep approach angle, and short runway, this is one of the

01:29.200 --> 01:33.960
few planes that can operate there and some airlines such as British Airways own the Ejet

01:33.960 --> 01:36.920
exclusively for use at this airport.

01:36.920 --> 01:42.860
The US, with its nearly 400 commercial airports and vast size, has service to many more smaller

01:42.860 --> 01:48.200
airports than Europe or Asia thanks to government subsidies so hundreds of airports in the US

01:48.200 --> 01:50.920
are served by non-Boeing or Airbus jets.

01:50.920 --> 01:55.640
There's a serious place for small planes and Bombardier knows this.

01:55.640 --> 01:59.800
Bombardier, while still one of Canada's largest companies, is a small player in the

01:59.800 --> 02:04.800
commercial airplane market only making about 6% of the world's commercial planes.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.720
The company has long made the successful CRJ regional jets but 10 years ago Bombardier

02:09.720 --> 02:12.000
had an idea for something else.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.600
They were going to make a larger, more efficient airplane to fit between the size of small

02:16.600 --> 02:21.280
regional jets and the larger planes of Boeing and Airbus—the C-Series.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.200
This plane was going to take advantage of all the modern advancements in aircraft design—composite

02:26.200 --> 02:31.120
construction, advanced aerodynamics, and high-bypass engines—to make one of the most efficient

02:31.120 --> 02:33.160
small airplanes on the market.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.320
From 2007 onwards the parts were selected, the plane was developed, and sales were booked.

02:38.320 --> 02:43.560
Then, on September 16th, 2013, it took flight for the first time.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.800
At this point the company was adamant that the aircraft would enter into commercial service

02:47.800 --> 02:52.560
just one year later in 2014, but then the problems began.

02:52.560 --> 02:57.060
While doing routine testing on the ground at the Mirabel Airport manufacturing base,

02:57.060 --> 03:00.780
one of the test aircraft suffered an uncontained engine failure.

03:00.780 --> 03:04.880
Not only did this strike a serious blow to the aircraft development timeline, it also

03:04.880 --> 03:09.680
prevented the manufacturer from exhibiting their new plane at the Farnborough Airshow—the

03:09.680 --> 03:13.280
largest and most important trade show in the industry where the company expected to

03:13.280 --> 03:15.780
secure crucial aircraft orders.

03:15.780 --> 03:20.660
The show only happens every two years so this was a significant setback.

03:20.660 --> 03:25.380
Some questioned whether the program could survive this blow, and it only barely did.

03:25.380 --> 03:28.840
The program was nearly out of money in 2015.

03:28.840 --> 03:33.440
Without the significant financial support of the governments of Canada and Quebec, the

03:33.440 --> 03:39.160
program and company likely would not have survived, but it did and on June 15th, 2016,

03:39.160 --> 03:44.220
the aircraft entered service with Swiss Airlines on its first ever commercial flight from Zurich

03:44.220 --> 03:45.340
to Paris.

03:45.340 --> 03:48.820
By all accounts the C-Series is a fantastic airplane.

03:48.820 --> 03:53.040
For airlines it's efficient and versatile while passengers praise its rare level of

03:53.040 --> 03:55.240
passenger comfort for a small plane.

03:55.240 --> 04:01.300
It even has a range of up to 3,800 miles meaning it could hypothetically fly transatlantic into

04:01.300 --> 04:04.940
small airports like London and Belfast city airports.

04:04.940 --> 04:10.800
As of October 2017, there are 14 C-Series planes currently flying—9 for Swiss Airlines

04:10.800 --> 04:17.480
and 5 for Air Baltic—but they have nearly 350 orders, enough to make the program profitable,

04:17.480 --> 04:22.480
but until recently they lacked the most valuable kind of order—American ones.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.800
With its tendency to use smaller planes, the American market will make or break the program,

04:27.800 --> 04:29.600
and Bombardier knew this.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.720
They were desperate for an order from one of the main three US airlines to prove its

04:33.720 --> 04:40.680
viability so much so that they allegedly sold 75 of them to Delta for only $20 million

04:40.680 --> 04:44.460
each—a quarter of the $80 million list price.

04:44.460 --> 04:49.900
That was an amazing price for Delta, but it was low enough that it might have been illegal.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.900
This is a practice known as dumping.

04:51.900 --> 04:57.260
The cost for Bombardier to make a C-Series plane is about $30 million so it was selling

04:57.260 --> 05:01.580
these planes that they hadn't even made yet at a loss because they wanted to gain

05:01.580 --> 05:03.600
prevalence in the US market.

05:03.600 --> 05:08.640
Predatory pricing techniques like this are against the law in the US and many other countries

05:08.640 --> 05:13.680
so Boeing took action and filed a dumping petition with the US Department of Commerce.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.160
But here's the problem—Boeing doesn't make an equivalent airplane to the C-Series.

05:18.160 --> 05:23.620
They say that the dumping will curtail the sale of its smaller 737-700 planes but Delta

05:23.620 --> 05:27.200
itself has said that they didn't want the 737s.

05:27.200 --> 05:33.260
Boeing couldn't offer them a delivery slot before 2020 and the 737 is a fundamentally

05:33.260 --> 05:34.260
different plane.

05:34.260 --> 05:39.100
The C-Series has better range, can take off from a shorter runway, is more efficient,

05:39.100 --> 05:41.900
and is empirically a smaller airplane.

05:41.900 --> 05:46.700
Boeing claims that Bombardier received subsidies that allowed for the below market pricing,

05:46.700 --> 05:51.060
but the money Bombardier received from the governments of Quebec and Canada came in either

05:51.060 --> 05:55.160
exchange for ownership of the program or in the form of interest-free loans that will

05:55.160 --> 05:56.540
be paid back.

05:56.540 --> 06:02.440
Boeing, on the other hand, has received over $14 billion in subsidies in the last 20 years

06:02.440 --> 06:05.760
through tax breaks from US state and federal governments.

06:05.760 --> 06:10.560
Nonetheless, Boeing asked the US Department of Commerce to impose an 80% tariff on the

06:10.560 --> 06:13.680
plane to bring the price above the manufacturing cost.

06:13.680 --> 06:19.000
The US Department of Commerce responded by placing a 300% tariff on the plane.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.480
At this point it seemed like the end of the line for the Bombardier plane.

06:22.480 --> 06:27.500
With a tariff that high, it could never be both competitive and profitable in the crucial

06:27.500 --> 06:28.860
US market.

06:28.860 --> 06:30.380
But then Airbus stepped in.

06:30.380 --> 06:37.260
On October 16th, 2017, the two companies announced that Airbus would be acquiring a 50.01% stake

06:37.260 --> 06:38.660
in the C-Series program.

06:38.660 --> 06:42.980
Bombardier is just giving away this stake for free, but the reason this is so great

06:42.980 --> 06:47.860
for them is, for one, Airbus is a marketing and sales powerhouse.

06:47.860 --> 06:52.180
Their resources far outstrip those of Bombardier and they will be able to sail more planes

06:52.180 --> 06:54.600
than Bombardier could ever have dreamt of.

06:54.600 --> 07:00.340
On the other side, since the C-Series doesn't really overlap in size with any Airbus plane,

07:00.340 --> 07:04.900
Airbus gains a new modern airplane in their lineup that will allow airlines to have truly

07:04.900 --> 07:06.340
all Airbus fleets.

07:06.340 --> 07:11.480
But the real reason Bombardier partnered up with Airbus is because of this—Airbus'

07:11.480 --> 07:13.780
final assembly line in Mobile, Alabama.

07:13.780 --> 07:18.520
By assembling the C-Series aircraft in the US, they'll essentially be American planes

07:18.520 --> 07:21.820
which means that they won't be subject to US import tariffs.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.740
At least according to Bombardier.

07:23.740 --> 07:27.260
Boeing believes that they will still be subject to the tariffs since they're still the same

07:27.260 --> 07:32.500
planes that receive subsidies while some external observers have suggested that only the 48%

07:32.500 --> 07:36.700
of the plane manufactured outside of the US will be subject to the 300% tariff.

07:36.700 --> 07:40.460
What will actually happen is up to the US Department of Commerce.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.640
Independent analysts have estimated that over the next 20 years there will be a demand for

07:44.640 --> 07:49.140
about 5,500 aircraft of the C-Series' size.

07:49.140 --> 07:54.260
Before the Airbus takeover, Bombardier was expected to fulfill 40% of that demand—just

07:54.260 --> 07:55.840
over 2,000 planes.

07:55.840 --> 08:01.580
After the takeover, the C-Series is expected to capture up to 60% of that market—well

08:01.580 --> 08:03.060
over 3,000 planes.

08:03.060 --> 08:08.500
That's tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue and the C-Series now has real potential

08:08.500 --> 08:10.900
to become an iconic airplane.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.060
While it would have been hard to predict this turn of events, this takeover, directly brought

08:15.060 --> 08:19.260
on by Boeing's actions, proves a hard-hitting blow to the company.

08:19.260 --> 08:24.280
Without spending a cent on development, Airbus now has a plane in a market segment that Boeing

08:24.280 --> 08:25.720
cannot compete with.

08:25.720 --> 08:30.940
The C-Series will dominate this market segment and every cent Airbus and Bombardier makes

08:30.940 --> 08:33.160
is money lost on Boeing's part.

08:33.160 --> 08:38.340
Just as Boeing expected, the C-Series will hurt its business in the US, but now it'll

08:38.340 --> 08:41.580
happen with a fully legal, American-made plane.

08:41.580 --> 08:46.280
If you have a business, a YouTube channel, a podcast, an event, or anything else, you

08:46.280 --> 08:50.280
need a website and there's nowhere better to build it than Squarespace.
