0	6740	At the end of the first millennium, around 1000 AD, China was definitively the most powerful
6740	8740	country in the world.
8740	12580	More than a third of the world lived within its borders, its technology was the most advanced
12580	18980	in existence, and its economy accounted for an astronomical 50% of the world's GDP.
18980	24680	The west paled in comparison to China, but eventually, Europe arose from its dark ages,
24680	28840	the importance of China diminished, and the west came to rule the world.
28840	32780	Today that is still largely the case, but China is rising again.
32780	40980	In 1978, China had a GDP of only $200 billion—only about 4% of the world's GDP—but nowadays
40980	49200	that GDP has risen to $11 trillion and accounts for 15% of all economic activity in the world.
49200	54520	This economic renaissance of the last 40 years is largely thanks to one industry—manufacturing.
55520	60540	We've come to accept that China is the world's factory, but it wasn't always this way.
60540	65080	In the early 20th century, goods were often just produced right where they were sold.
65080	67680	America made American goods, Europe made European goods.
67680	71480	It wasn't until cheap, worldwide shipping became available that the production side
71480	76120	of a company could be relocated to the other side of the world, but why did China win?
76120	79720	How did this country become the manufacturing giant it is today?
79720	84040	In 1978, Deng Xiaoping took power in the People's Republic of China.
84080	89120	He quickly visited Bangkok, Singapore, and other flourishing Asian cities and was convinced
89120	93480	that, in order to succeed, China needed to open itself up to the outside world, at least
93480	94480	to an extent.
94480	99440	He gave people control of their farms, privatized business, and most importantly, allowed for
99440	103000	an investment in the country for the first time in decades.
103000	107240	He opened up four special economic zones with tax incentives and exemption from the oversight
107240	111000	that the rest of the country saw on its investments and trade activity.
111000	115660	These four zones were essentially the free market portions of China, but none was more
115660	120120	successful than this one—Shenzhen in the Guangdong province so I went there to see
120120	122080	what it was like.
122080	127360	Before its designation as a special economic zone in 1980, Shenzhen was a tiny town with
127360	133360	about 30,000 inhabitants, but today that's grown to nearly 18 million people.
133360	136800	That means that its size rivals that of New York and London.
137120	143040	It's believed that Shenzhen might have been the single fastest growing city in human history.
143040	147760	Every other special economic zone was an established area before its designation, but Shenzhen
147760	152280	made sense as a spot where China could embrace the west as it lay just north of the border
152280	155960	of Hong Kong—what was at the time a British territory.
155960	159520	Today Shenzhen is the electronics manufacturing capital of the world.
159520	163240	So Shenzhen as a city is really known for two things.
163240	169000	One is its manufacturing capabilities especially for consumer electronics products.
169000	177280	And second is gravitation for talents or human resources especially on the product development
177280	180320	and research and development disciplines.
180320	187000	Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, Canon—they all manufacture products here in Shenzhen.
187000	192600	In fact, 90% of the world's electronics are made at least in part in this city.
192800	196240	Everything just costs less in China so labor costs less too.
196240	200600	Where a factory in the United States might pay upwards of $10 to $15 an hour, a Chinese
200600	205160	laborer would happily accept $3 or $4 an hour in Shenzhen.
205160	210180	When I was there I withdrew the equivalent of $80 from an ATM upon arrival and left four
210180	212160	days later with cash left over.
212160	215360	A 30 minute taxi ride cost about $7 US dollars.
215360	218740	A full meal at a local place was about $3.
218740	221520	But China isn't cheap entirely naturally.
221560	224760	China has artificially depressed the value of their currency.
224760	229900	Up until 2005, the Chinese government just said that the exchange rate was 8.271 per
229900	231800	dollar and that was that.
231800	236440	They then went a few years allowing it to increase in value within a margin but in 2008
236440	240400	they pegged its value again to make Chinese exports more attractive during the financial
240400	241400	crisis.
241400	245240	Nowadays the government just picks an exchange rate daily and lets the currency fluctuate
245240	247400	from it by up to 2%.
247400	251160	This just makes it so western companies can buy more for less.
251160	256200	China also doesn't charge taxes on exports while the US doesn't charge taxes on imports.
256200	260700	The US doesn't even charge customs fees for some products like tablet PCs so some
260700	265680	products can make it all the way from their factory in China to stores in the US completely
265680	267020	tax free.
267020	269920	When I was in Shenzhen I visited a company called Anker.
269920	273440	They make all sorts of consumer electronics but chances are if you have something from
273440	275480	them it's one of their portable batteries.
275480	280360	I asked their CEO why so many electronic companies are now based in Shenzhen.
280360	285280	So the advantage is that we're close to the supply chain so everything is faster.
285280	293360	So instead of like you do a mock-up and see it like two weeks later, here actually you
293360	298040	send them a designed mock-up and you receive it like three days later.
298040	302140	In Shenzhen there are markets where you can buy every part imaginable, there are factories
302140	306800	ready to build prototypes in a matter of days, there are engineers ready to work at a drop
306800	308120	of a hat.
308120	310440	Development just happens faster in Shenzhen.
310440	314780	A US company might use the same factories as one based in Shenzhen but the geographical
314780	316880	distance makes production slower.
316880	319880	In addition, word travels fast in Shenzhen.
319880	324040	A few years ago Anker was first to market with a technology called Power IQ that allows
324040	325760	for faster device charging.
325760	329080	The engineers from Anker told me that a big reason they were able to go to market before
329080	333040	the western companies was because they heard about it first thanks to the proximity to
333040	334920	other engineers and companies.
334920	339720	Shenzhen just produces things better and faster, but a product isn't just a physical item.
339720	346880	All this TV in Shenzhen is being in Shenzhen for this company is an advantage for the supply
346880	356040	chain that we can deduct very good products with competitive price but for the brand it's
356040	358160	also a kind of a challenge.
358160	360800	What Shenzhen can't build as well is brands.
360800	365000	Western companies like Anker have been able to to an extent thanks to smart PR and marketing
365000	367920	but some other companies just don't bother.
367920	372240	Lucrative western consumers want familiar and approachable feeling brands but cultural
372240	377740	differences and geographic distance often make Chinese based companies just seem different.
377740	382040	All across Shenzhen I saw these boxes filled with rentable portable chargers and as it
382040	386760	turns out it was an Anker product, but the Chinese designed product didn't really succeed
386760	387760	in the western market.
388320	395400	So actually talking about Anker box, the product is originally designed for the western market.
395400	400040	However, actually our trial in Seattle wasn't that successful.
400040	407640	So we realized first of all like you know US people actually when they go to a bar they
407640	411480	actually really go there drinking instead of looking at their phones.
411800	418160	Well if you're going walking to a bar in China you'll find actually like 20 tables
418160	420860	of people standing around looking at their phone.
420860	424480	When the designers are thousands of miles away from the consumer they might not be as
424480	426400	knowledgeable of their wants.
426400	430440	Some companies have sprung up in Shenzhen whose whole business is to develop and produce
430440	433960	products without a brand—they're called white label companies.
433960	438420	They might produce earphones for example then sell them to a western audio company who will
438420	441460	attach their brand and sell the product at a markup.
441460	445860	Despite its enormous role in increasing the GDP of China thirty-fold in the last thirty
445860	451260	years, manufacturing is not an entirely sustainable industry for the country long-term.
451260	455500	The problem is that, rather ironically, the economic growth that manufacturing spurred
455500	460700	in China has increased labor prices to a point where their manufacturing is less competitive.
460700	465740	Before manufacturing came in, China was a country of poor rural farmers, but today China
465740	469220	has a real middle class and cities that are expensive to live in.
469220	473180	It used to be that workers like the ones at Anchor's Factory moved to the city for a
473180	477300	few years when they were young to make money for their family back home, but nowadays people
477300	481660	are moving to cities permanently and want to be able to set up solid, middle-class,
481660	483020	urban lives.
483020	489140	The average cost for real estate in central Shenzhen is almost $1,200 per square foot—that's
489140	491700	even higher than San Francisco and New York.
491700	496700	Even when workers live outside the city center, higher wages are necessary even just to pay
496700	497700	for housing.
497700	502520	At the same time, manufacturing is becoming less labor intensive every day as robots and
502520	506100	automation are becoming increasingly advanced and inexpensive.
506100	511460	In 2015, China launched an initiative spending hundreds of billions of dollars each year
511460	516100	to upgrade and automate factories to keep prices low, but this will likely do little
516100	519740	to keep companies from packing up shop and moving elsewhere.
519780	523340	Information lines that can be automated are likely to move back to the United States and
523340	525560	the rest of the western market.
525560	529140	Robots cost the same whether they're in the United States or China so manufacturing
529140	533740	products in the US help save on shipping costs and certainly is good for PR.
533740	538140	At the same time, the labor intensive jobs that China prospered on in the past decades
538140	543580	are moving to less developed and less expensive countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India.
543580	547340	Chinese manufacturing firms are responding to this by opening up their own factories
547340	551540	all across the world—everywhere from Africa to the United States itself.
551540	556020	The model that might work for China in the future is that of Anchor—Chinese based firms
556020	560300	that can take advantage of their proximity to the production lines to cut down on development
560300	561580	cost and time.
561580	566900	Shenzhen-based startups like Anchor, DJI, and OnePlus have already succeeded in taking
566900	571060	advantage of this proximity, but more are being established each day.
571060	576140	If you see a hardware-based Kickstarter campaign, there's a good chance it comes from Shenzhen.
576140	580500	Ten years ago a company would be hard-pressed to succeed in Shenzhen as its own brand because
580500	585820	historically the retailer has acted as a barrier in between the manufacturer and consumer,
585820	591140	but with the rise of Amazon and other e-commerce sites, it's now possible for eastern companies
591140	596700	to sell directly to the western consumer in a system that rewards for quality over price.
596700	600140	The time really is ripe for Chinese entrepreneurship.
600140	603860	While Silicon Valley might be the dominant area for software startups, it's hard to
603860	609700	rival Shenzhen as an ecosystem for hardware development and manufacturing.
609700	613400	I have to give a huge thanks to Anchor for bringing me out to Shenzhen to research and
613400	614400	film this video.
614400	618620	It truly would not have been possible without them and they gave me complete creative control
618620	619620	over the video.
619620	624040	I've actually owned and used an Anchor battery for over five years that's never broken
624040	628280	down even when it's been accidentally submerged twice and dropped countless times, but luckily
628280	630940	they upgraded me to one of their newest ones which I love.
630940	634860	The main thing I want to plug for them is their Power it Up contest going on right now.
634860	638640	Ten winners will each get $2,000 in cash and a bunch of free Anchor products.
638640	642740	To enter you make a video up to one minute long about an unpleasant or awkward situation
642740	646660	caused by running out of power, upload it to YouTube, then share it on their page and
646660	649420	the ten highest voted ones at the end of the contest win.
649420	652340	The link to enter is in the description so good luck.
652340	656140	Aside from that, please be sure to check out my podcast Showmakers and subscribe to this
656140	659220	channel to get all my future videos right when they come out.
