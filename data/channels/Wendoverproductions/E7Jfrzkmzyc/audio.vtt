00:00.000 --> 00:06.740
At the end of the first millennium, around 1000 AD, China was definitively the most powerful

00:06.740 --> 00:08.740
country in the world.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.580
More than a third of the world lived within its borders, its technology was the most advanced

00:12.580 --> 00:18.980
in existence, and its economy accounted for an astronomical 50% of the world's GDP.

00:18.980 --> 00:24.680
The west paled in comparison to China, but eventually, Europe arose from its dark ages,

00:24.680 --> 00:28.840
the importance of China diminished, and the west came to rule the world.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.780
Today that is still largely the case, but China is rising again.

00:32.780 --> 00:40.980
In 1978, China had a GDP of only $200 billion—only about 4% of the world's GDP—but nowadays

00:40.980 --> 00:49.200
that GDP has risen to $11 trillion and accounts for 15% of all economic activity in the world.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.520
This economic renaissance of the last 40 years is largely thanks to one industry—manufacturing.

00:55.520 --> 01:00.540
We've come to accept that China is the world's factory, but it wasn't always this way.

01:00.540 --> 01:05.080
In the early 20th century, goods were often just produced right where they were sold.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.680
America made American goods, Europe made European goods.

01:07.680 --> 01:11.480
It wasn't until cheap, worldwide shipping became available that the production side

01:11.480 --> 01:16.120
of a company could be relocated to the other side of the world, but why did China win?

01:16.120 --> 01:19.720
How did this country become the manufacturing giant it is today?

01:19.720 --> 01:24.040
In 1978, Deng Xiaoping took power in the People's Republic of China.

01:24.080 --> 01:29.120
He quickly visited Bangkok, Singapore, and other flourishing Asian cities and was convinced

01:29.120 --> 01:33.480
that, in order to succeed, China needed to open itself up to the outside world, at least

01:33.480 --> 01:34.480
to an extent.

01:34.480 --> 01:39.440
He gave people control of their farms, privatized business, and most importantly, allowed for

01:39.440 --> 01:43.000
an investment in the country for the first time in decades.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.240
He opened up four special economic zones with tax incentives and exemption from the oversight

01:47.240 --> 01:51.000
that the rest of the country saw on its investments and trade activity.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.660
These four zones were essentially the free market portions of China, but none was more

01:55.660 --> 02:00.120
successful than this one—Shenzhen in the Guangdong province so I went there to see

02:00.120 --> 02:02.080
what it was like.

02:02.080 --> 02:07.360
Before its designation as a special economic zone in 1980, Shenzhen was a tiny town with

02:07.360 --> 02:13.360
about 30,000 inhabitants, but today that's grown to nearly 18 million people.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.800
That means that its size rivals that of New York and London.

02:17.120 --> 02:23.040
It's believed that Shenzhen might have been the single fastest growing city in human history.

02:23.040 --> 02:27.760
Every other special economic zone was an established area before its designation, but Shenzhen

02:27.760 --> 02:32.280
made sense as a spot where China could embrace the west as it lay just north of the border

02:32.280 --> 02:35.960
of Hong Kong—what was at the time a British territory.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.520
Today Shenzhen is the electronics manufacturing capital of the world.

02:39.520 --> 02:43.240
So Shenzhen as a city is really known for two things.

02:43.240 --> 02:49.000
One is its manufacturing capabilities especially for consumer electronics products.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.280
And second is gravitation for talents or human resources especially on the product development

02:57.280 --> 03:00.320
and research and development disciplines.

03:00.320 --> 03:07.000
Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, Canon—they all manufacture products here in Shenzhen.

03:07.000 --> 03:12.600
In fact, 90% of the world's electronics are made at least in part in this city.

03:12.800 --> 03:16.240
Everything just costs less in China so labor costs less too.

03:16.240 --> 03:20.600
Where a factory in the United States might pay upwards of $10 to $15 an hour, a Chinese

03:20.600 --> 03:25.160
laborer would happily accept $3 or $4 an hour in Shenzhen.

03:25.160 --> 03:30.180
When I was there I withdrew the equivalent of $80 from an ATM upon arrival and left four

03:30.180 --> 03:32.160
days later with cash left over.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.360
A 30 minute taxi ride cost about $7 US dollars.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.740
A full meal at a local place was about $3.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.520
But China isn't cheap entirely naturally.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.760
China has artificially depressed the value of their currency.

03:44.760 --> 03:49.900
Up until 2005, the Chinese government just said that the exchange rate was 8.271 per

03:49.900 --> 03:51.800
dollar and that was that.

03:51.800 --> 03:56.440
They then went a few years allowing it to increase in value within a margin but in 2008

03:56.440 --> 04:00.400
they pegged its value again to make Chinese exports more attractive during the financial

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
crisis.

04:01.400 --> 04:05.240
Nowadays the government just picks an exchange rate daily and lets the currency fluctuate

04:05.240 --> 04:07.400
from it by up to 2%.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.160
This just makes it so western companies can buy more for less.

04:11.160 --> 04:16.200
China also doesn't charge taxes on exports while the US doesn't charge taxes on imports.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.700
The US doesn't even charge customs fees for some products like tablet PCs so some

04:20.700 --> 04:25.680
products can make it all the way from their factory in China to stores in the US completely

04:25.680 --> 04:27.020
tax free.

04:27.020 --> 04:29.920
When I was in Shenzhen I visited a company called Anker.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.440
They make all sorts of consumer electronics but chances are if you have something from

04:33.440 --> 04:35.480
them it's one of their portable batteries.

04:35.480 --> 04:40.360
I asked their CEO why so many electronic companies are now based in Shenzhen.

04:40.360 --> 04:45.280
So the advantage is that we're close to the supply chain so everything is faster.

04:45.280 --> 04:53.360
So instead of like you do a mock-up and see it like two weeks later, here actually you

04:53.360 --> 04:58.040
send them a designed mock-up and you receive it like three days later.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.140
In Shenzhen there are markets where you can buy every part imaginable, there are factories

05:02.140 --> 05:06.800
ready to build prototypes in a matter of days, there are engineers ready to work at a drop

05:06.800 --> 05:08.120
of a hat.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.440
Development just happens faster in Shenzhen.

05:10.440 --> 05:14.780
A US company might use the same factories as one based in Shenzhen but the geographical

05:14.780 --> 05:16.880
distance makes production slower.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.880
In addition, word travels fast in Shenzhen.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.040
A few years ago Anker was first to market with a technology called Power IQ that allows

05:24.040 --> 05:25.760
for faster device charging.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.080
The engineers from Anker told me that a big reason they were able to go to market before

05:29.080 --> 05:33.040
the western companies was because they heard about it first thanks to the proximity to

05:33.040 --> 05:34.920
other engineers and companies.

05:34.920 --> 05:39.720
Shenzhen just produces things better and faster, but a product isn't just a physical item.

05:39.720 --> 05:46.880
All this TV in Shenzhen is being in Shenzhen for this company is an advantage for the supply

05:46.880 --> 05:56.040
chain that we can deduct very good products with competitive price but for the brand it's

05:56.040 --> 05:58.160
also a kind of a challenge.

05:58.160 --> 06:00.800
What Shenzhen can't build as well is brands.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.000
Western companies like Anker have been able to to an extent thanks to smart PR and marketing

06:05.000 --> 06:07.920
but some other companies just don't bother.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.240
Lucrative western consumers want familiar and approachable feeling brands but cultural

06:12.240 --> 06:17.740
differences and geographic distance often make Chinese based companies just seem different.

06:17.740 --> 06:22.040
All across Shenzhen I saw these boxes filled with rentable portable chargers and as it

06:22.040 --> 06:26.760
turns out it was an Anker product, but the Chinese designed product didn't really succeed

06:26.760 --> 06:27.760
in the western market.

06:28.320 --> 06:35.400
So actually talking about Anker box, the product is originally designed for the western market.

06:35.400 --> 06:40.040
However, actually our trial in Seattle wasn't that successful.

06:40.040 --> 06:47.640
So we realized first of all like you know US people actually when they go to a bar they

06:47.640 --> 06:51.480
actually really go there drinking instead of looking at their phones.

06:51.800 --> 06:58.160
Well if you're going walking to a bar in China you'll find actually like 20 tables

06:58.160 --> 07:00.860
of people standing around looking at their phone.

07:00.860 --> 07:04.480
When the designers are thousands of miles away from the consumer they might not be as

07:04.480 --> 07:06.400
knowledgeable of their wants.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.440
Some companies have sprung up in Shenzhen whose whole business is to develop and produce

07:10.440 --> 07:13.960
products without a brand—they're called white label companies.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.420
They might produce earphones for example then sell them to a western audio company who will

07:18.420 --> 07:21.460
attach their brand and sell the product at a markup.

07:21.460 --> 07:25.860
Despite its enormous role in increasing the GDP of China thirty-fold in the last thirty

07:25.860 --> 07:31.260
years, manufacturing is not an entirely sustainable industry for the country long-term.

07:31.260 --> 07:35.500
The problem is that, rather ironically, the economic growth that manufacturing spurred

07:35.500 --> 07:40.700
in China has increased labor prices to a point where their manufacturing is less competitive.

07:40.700 --> 07:45.740
Before manufacturing came in, China was a country of poor rural farmers, but today China

07:45.740 --> 07:49.220
has a real middle class and cities that are expensive to live in.

07:49.220 --> 07:53.180
It used to be that workers like the ones at Anchor's Factory moved to the city for a

07:53.180 --> 07:57.300
few years when they were young to make money for their family back home, but nowadays people

07:57.300 --> 08:01.660
are moving to cities permanently and want to be able to set up solid, middle-class,

08:01.660 --> 08:03.020
urban lives.

08:03.020 --> 08:09.140
The average cost for real estate in central Shenzhen is almost $1,200 per square foot—that's

08:09.140 --> 08:11.700
even higher than San Francisco and New York.

08:11.700 --> 08:16.700
Even when workers live outside the city center, higher wages are necessary even just to pay

08:16.700 --> 08:17.700
for housing.

08:17.700 --> 08:22.520
At the same time, manufacturing is becoming less labor intensive every day as robots and

08:22.520 --> 08:26.100
automation are becoming increasingly advanced and inexpensive.

08:26.100 --> 08:31.460
In 2015, China launched an initiative spending hundreds of billions of dollars each year

08:31.460 --> 08:36.100
to upgrade and automate factories to keep prices low, but this will likely do little

08:36.100 --> 08:39.740
to keep companies from packing up shop and moving elsewhere.

08:39.780 --> 08:43.340
Information lines that can be automated are likely to move back to the United States and

08:43.340 --> 08:45.560
the rest of the western market.

08:45.560 --> 08:49.140
Robots cost the same whether they're in the United States or China so manufacturing

08:49.140 --> 08:53.740
products in the US help save on shipping costs and certainly is good for PR.

08:53.740 --> 08:58.140
At the same time, the labor intensive jobs that China prospered on in the past decades

08:58.140 --> 09:03.580
are moving to less developed and less expensive countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India.

09:03.580 --> 09:07.340
Chinese manufacturing firms are responding to this by opening up their own factories

09:07.340 --> 09:11.540
all across the world—everywhere from Africa to the United States itself.

09:11.540 --> 09:16.020
The model that might work for China in the future is that of Anchor—Chinese based firms

09:16.020 --> 09:20.300
that can take advantage of their proximity to the production lines to cut down on development

09:20.300 --> 09:21.580
cost and time.

09:21.580 --> 09:26.900
Shenzhen-based startups like Anchor, DJI, and OnePlus have already succeeded in taking

09:26.900 --> 09:31.060
advantage of this proximity, but more are being established each day.

09:31.060 --> 09:36.140
If you see a hardware-based Kickstarter campaign, there's a good chance it comes from Shenzhen.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.500
Ten years ago a company would be hard-pressed to succeed in Shenzhen as its own brand because

09:40.500 --> 09:45.820
historically the retailer has acted as a barrier in between the manufacturer and consumer,

09:45.820 --> 09:51.140
but with the rise of Amazon and other e-commerce sites, it's now possible for eastern companies

09:51.140 --> 09:56.700
to sell directly to the western consumer in a system that rewards for quality over price.

09:56.700 --> 10:00.140
The time really is ripe for Chinese entrepreneurship.

10:00.140 --> 10:03.860
While Silicon Valley might be the dominant area for software startups, it's hard to

10:03.860 --> 10:09.700
rival Shenzhen as an ecosystem for hardware development and manufacturing.

10:09.700 --> 10:13.400
I have to give a huge thanks to Anchor for bringing me out to Shenzhen to research and

10:13.400 --> 10:14.400
film this video.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.620
It truly would not have been possible without them and they gave me complete creative control

10:18.620 --> 10:19.620
over the video.

10:19.620 --> 10:24.040
I've actually owned and used an Anchor battery for over five years that's never broken

10:24.040 --> 10:28.280
down even when it's been accidentally submerged twice and dropped countless times, but luckily

10:28.280 --> 10:30.940
they upgraded me to one of their newest ones which I love.

10:30.940 --> 10:34.860
The main thing I want to plug for them is their Power it Up contest going on right now.

10:34.860 --> 10:38.640
Ten winners will each get $2,000 in cash and a bunch of free Anchor products.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.740
To enter you make a video up to one minute long about an unpleasant or awkward situation

10:42.740 --> 10:46.660
caused by running out of power, upload it to YouTube, then share it on their page and

10:46.660 --> 10:49.420
the ten highest voted ones at the end of the contest win.

10:49.420 --> 10:52.340
The link to enter is in the description so good luck.

10:52.340 --> 10:56.140
Aside from that, please be sure to check out my podcast Showmakers and subscribe to this

10:56.140 --> 10:59.220
