1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740
At the end of the first millennium, around 1000 AD, China was definitively the most powerful

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,740
country in the world.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,580
More than a third of the world lived within its borders, its technology was the most advanced

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:18,980
in existence, and its economy accounted for an astronomical 50% of the world's GDP.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,680
The west paled in comparison to China, but eventually, Europe arose from its dark ages,

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,840
the importance of China diminished, and the west came to rule the world.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,780
Today that is still largely the case, but China is rising again.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:40,980
In 1978, China had a GDP of only $200 billion—only about 4% of the world's GDP—but nowadays

9
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:49,200
that GDP has risen to $11 trillion and accounts for 15% of all economic activity in the world.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,520
This economic renaissance of the last 40 years is largely thanks to one industry—manufacturing.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,540
We've come to accept that China is the world's factory, but it wasn't always this way.

12
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,080
In the early 20th century, goods were often just produced right where they were sold.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,680
America made American goods, Europe made European goods.

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,480
It wasn't until cheap, worldwide shipping became available that the production side

15
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:16,120
of a company could be relocated to the other side of the world, but why did China win?

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,720
How did this country become the manufacturing giant it is today?

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,040
In 1978, Deng Xiaoping took power in the People's Republic of China.

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,120
He quickly visited Bangkok, Singapore, and other flourishing Asian cities and was convinced

19
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,480
that, in order to succeed, China needed to open itself up to the outside world, at least

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
to an extent.

21
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,440
He gave people control of their farms, privatized business, and most importantly, allowed for

22
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,000
an investment in the country for the first time in decades.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,240
He opened up four special economic zones with tax incentives and exemption from the oversight

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,000
that the rest of the country saw on its investments and trade activity.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,660
These four zones were essentially the free market portions of China, but none was more

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,120
successful than this one—Shenzhen in the Guangdong province so I went there to see

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,080
what it was like.

28
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,360
Before its designation as a special economic zone in 1980, Shenzhen was a tiny town with

29
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,360
about 30,000 inhabitants, but today that's grown to nearly 18 million people.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,800
That means that its size rivals that of New York and London.

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,040
It's believed that Shenzhen might have been the single fastest growing city in human history.

32
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
Every other special economic zone was an established area before its designation, but Shenzhen

33
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,280
made sense as a spot where China could embrace the west as it lay just north of the border

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,960
of Hong Kong—what was at the time a British territory.

35
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,520
Today Shenzhen is the electronics manufacturing capital of the world.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,240
So Shenzhen as a city is really known for two things.

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,000
One is its manufacturing capabilities especially for consumer electronics products.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,280
And second is gravitation for talents or human resources especially on the product development

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,320
and research and development disciplines.

40
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,000
Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Sony, Canon—they all manufacture products here in Shenzhen.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,600
In fact, 90% of the world's electronics are made at least in part in this city.

42
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,240
Everything just costs less in China so labor costs less too.

43
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,600
Where a factory in the United States might pay upwards of $10 to $15 an hour, a Chinese

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,160
laborer would happily accept $3 or $4 an hour in Shenzhen.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,180
When I was there I withdrew the equivalent of $80 from an ATM upon arrival and left four

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,160
days later with cash left over.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,360
A 30 minute taxi ride cost about $7 US dollars.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,740
A full meal at a local place was about $3.

49
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,520
But China isn't cheap entirely naturally.

50
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,760
China has artificially depressed the value of their currency.

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,900
Up until 2005, the Chinese government just said that the exchange rate was 8.271 per

52
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,800
dollar and that was that.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,440
They then went a few years allowing it to increase in value within a margin but in 2008

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,400
they pegged its value again to make Chinese exports more attractive during the financial

55
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
crisis.

56
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,240
Nowadays the government just picks an exchange rate daily and lets the currency fluctuate

57
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,400
from it by up to 2%.

58
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,160
This just makes it so western companies can buy more for less.

59
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,200
China also doesn't charge taxes on exports while the US doesn't charge taxes on imports.

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,700
The US doesn't even charge customs fees for some products like tablet PCs so some

61
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,680
products can make it all the way from their factory in China to stores in the US completely

62
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,020
tax free.

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,920
When I was in Shenzhen I visited a company called Anker.

64
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,440
They make all sorts of consumer electronics but chances are if you have something from

65
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,480
them it's one of their portable batteries.

66
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,360
I asked their CEO why so many electronic companies are now based in Shenzhen.

67
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,280
So the advantage is that we're close to the supply chain so everything is faster.

68
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:53,360
So instead of like you do a mock-up and see it like two weeks later, here actually you

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,040
send them a designed mock-up and you receive it like three days later.

70
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:02,140
In Shenzhen there are markets where you can buy every part imaginable, there are factories

71
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,800
ready to build prototypes in a matter of days, there are engineers ready to work at a drop

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,120
of a hat.

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,440
Development just happens faster in Shenzhen.

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,780
A US company might use the same factories as one based in Shenzhen but the geographical

75
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,880
distance makes production slower.

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,880
In addition, word travels fast in Shenzhen.

77
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,040
A few years ago Anker was first to market with a technology called Power IQ that allows

78
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,760
for faster device charging.

79
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,080
The engineers from Anker told me that a big reason they were able to go to market before

80
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,040
the western companies was because they heard about it first thanks to the proximity to

81
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,920
other engineers and companies.

82
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,720
Shenzhen just produces things better and faster, but a product isn't just a physical item.

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,880
All this TV in Shenzhen is being in Shenzhen for this company is an advantage for the supply

84
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:56,040
chain that we can deduct very good products with competitive price but for the brand it's

85
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,160
also a kind of a challenge.

86
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,800
What Shenzhen can't build as well is brands.

87
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Western companies like Anker have been able to to an extent thanks to smart PR and marketing

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,920
but some other companies just don't bother.

89
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,240
Lucrative western consumers want familiar and approachable feeling brands but cultural

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,740
differences and geographic distance often make Chinese based companies just seem different.

91
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,040
All across Shenzhen I saw these boxes filled with rentable portable chargers and as it

92
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,760
turns out it was an Anker product, but the Chinese designed product didn't really succeed

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,760
in the western market.

94
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:35,400
So actually talking about Anker box, the product is originally designed for the western market.

95
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,040
However, actually our trial in Seattle wasn't that successful.

96
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:47,640
So we realized first of all like you know US people actually when they go to a bar they

97
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,480
actually really go there drinking instead of looking at their phones.

98
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,160
Well if you're going walking to a bar in China you'll find actually like 20 tables

99
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,860
of people standing around looking at their phone.

100
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,480
When the designers are thousands of miles away from the consumer they might not be as

101
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,400
knowledgeable of their wants.

102
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,440
Some companies have sprung up in Shenzhen whose whole business is to develop and produce

103
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,960
products without a brand—they're called white label companies.

104
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,420
They might produce earphones for example then sell them to a western audio company who will

105
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,460
attach their brand and sell the product at a markup.

106
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,860
Despite its enormous role in increasing the GDP of China thirty-fold in the last thirty

107
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,260
years, manufacturing is not an entirely sustainable industry for the country long-term.

108
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,500
The problem is that, rather ironically, the economic growth that manufacturing spurred

109
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,700
in China has increased labor prices to a point where their manufacturing is less competitive.

110
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:45,740
Before manufacturing came in, China was a country of poor rural farmers, but today China

111
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,220
has a real middle class and cities that are expensive to live in.

112
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,180
It used to be that workers like the ones at Anchor's Factory moved to the city for a

113
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,300
few years when they were young to make money for their family back home, but nowadays people

114
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,660
are moving to cities permanently and want to be able to set up solid, middle-class,

115
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,020
urban lives.

116
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,140
The average cost for real estate in central Shenzhen is almost $1,200 per square foot—that's

117
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,700
even higher than San Francisco and New York.

118
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Even when workers live outside the city center, higher wages are necessary even just to pay

119
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
for housing.

120
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,520
At the same time, manufacturing is becoming less labor intensive every day as robots and

121
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,100
automation are becoming increasingly advanced and inexpensive.

122
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,460
In 2015, China launched an initiative spending hundreds of billions of dollars each year

123
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,100
to upgrade and automate factories to keep prices low, but this will likely do little

124
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,740
to keep companies from packing up shop and moving elsewhere.

125
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:43,340
Information lines that can be automated are likely to move back to the United States and

126
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,560
the rest of the western market.

127
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,140
Robots cost the same whether they're in the United States or China so manufacturing

128
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,740
products in the US help save on shipping costs and certainly is good for PR.

129
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,140
At the same time, the labor intensive jobs that China prospered on in the past decades

130
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,580
are moving to less developed and less expensive countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India.

131
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,340
Chinese manufacturing firms are responding to this by opening up their own factories

132
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,540
all across the world—everywhere from Africa to the United States itself.

133
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,020
The model that might work for China in the future is that of Anchor—Chinese based firms

134
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,300
that can take advantage of their proximity to the production lines to cut down on development

135
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,580
cost and time.

136
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,900
Shenzhen-based startups like Anchor, DJI, and OnePlus have already succeeded in taking

137
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:31,060
advantage of this proximity, but more are being established each day.

138
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:36,140
If you see a hardware-based Kickstarter campaign, there's a good chance it comes from Shenzhen.

139
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,500
Ten years ago a company would be hard-pressed to succeed in Shenzhen as its own brand because

140
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,820
historically the retailer has acted as a barrier in between the manufacturer and consumer,

141
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,140
but with the rise of Amazon and other e-commerce sites, it's now possible for eastern companies

142
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,700
to sell directly to the western consumer in a system that rewards for quality over price.

143
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,140
The time really is ripe for Chinese entrepreneurship.

144
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,860
While Silicon Valley might be the dominant area for software startups, it's hard to

145
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:09,700
rival Shenzhen as an ecosystem for hardware development and manufacturing.

146
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,400
I have to give a huge thanks to Anchor for bringing me out to Shenzhen to research and

147
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
film this video.

148
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,620
It truly would not have been possible without them and they gave me complete creative control

149
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
over the video.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,040
I've actually owned and used an Anchor battery for over five years that's never broken

151
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,280
down even when it's been accidentally submerged twice and dropped countless times, but luckily

152
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,940
they upgraded me to one of their newest ones which I love.

153
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,860
The main thing I want to plug for them is their Power it Up contest going on right now.

154
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,640
Ten winners will each get $2,000 in cash and a bunch of free Anchor products.

155
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,740
To enter you make a video up to one minute long about an unpleasant or awkward situation

156
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,660
caused by running out of power, upload it to YouTube, then share it on their page and

157
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,420
the ten highest voted ones at the end of the contest win.

158
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,340
The link to enter is in the description so good luck.

159
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,140
Aside from that, please be sure to check out my podcast Showmakers and subscribe to this
