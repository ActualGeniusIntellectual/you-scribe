00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
I love making interesting videos.

00:02.420 --> 00:07.860
The most interesting topics are often exceptionsâ€”deviations from the norm.

00:07.860 --> 00:11.900
All of us live in countries where there are laws and rules and governing bodies telling

00:11.900 --> 00:14.260
us what we can and can't do.

00:14.260 --> 00:19.420
But 70% of the world is ocean where there are no countries, no governing bodies to tell

00:19.420 --> 00:20.980
us what's right and wrong.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.100
That's why maritime law exists.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.160
Let's start with a hypothetical.

00:25.160 --> 00:29.380
A baby is born on a cruise ship sailing in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.

00:29.380 --> 00:31.900
What nationality does it take?

00:31.900 --> 00:35.620
This is the coast of some fictional place in some fictional country governed by some

00:35.620 --> 00:37.220
fictional government.

00:37.220 --> 00:41.420
From this line, which is the water line at the lowest low tide, every country is allowed

00:41.420 --> 00:43.860
12 miles of territorial waters.

00:43.860 --> 00:49.160
It used to be 3 miles, the distance a cannon could shoot offshore, but that has since changed.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.620
Those 12 miles are the property of a country.

00:51.620 --> 00:56.320
They can do pretty much whatever they please in it and all domestic laws apply.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.360
Ocean ships are, however, sometimes allowed to enter into these waters under the principle

01:00.360 --> 01:02.020
of innocent passage.

01:02.020 --> 01:06.200
If ships have an innocent purpose, which does not include fishing, polluting, weapons practice,

01:06.200 --> 01:10.280
or spying, they are allowed to pass through the territorial waters of a foreign nation

01:10.280 --> 01:14.800
without permission as long as they do so quickly and without stopping on shore.

01:14.800 --> 01:19.320
Beyond the territorial waters, there is another 12 miles of the contiguous zone.

01:19.320 --> 01:24.260
This zone allows a country to enforce laws as long as they fall into one of four categories.

01:24.340 --> 01:29.260
If the laws have to do with customs, taxation, immigration, or pollution, they can be enforced

01:29.260 --> 01:30.940
in the contiguous zone.

01:30.940 --> 01:35.920
Beyond the contiguous waters is the exclusive economic zone, also known as the EEZ.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.640
This zone extends 200 nautical miles from shore.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.620
Beyond the territorial waters, the EEZ is in international waters.

01:42.620 --> 01:47.580
However, only the country who holds the exclusive economic zone has the right to harvest natural

01:47.580 --> 01:49.300
resources in the area.

01:49.300 --> 01:53.020
This law was originally set up to help with disputes over fishing rights, but has since

01:53.020 --> 01:56.300
been incredibly useful with the boom in oil drilling.

01:56.300 --> 02:01.480
All these laws do, however, occasionally cause some disputes due to overlapping zones.

02:01.480 --> 02:05.060
This is the South China Sea, an incredibly important waterway.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.920
Nearly one third of the world's shipping traffic passes through it and it reportedly

02:08.920 --> 02:11.520
has huge untapped oil reserves.

02:11.520 --> 02:14.500
China has this land so it says it has all this water.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.500
Malaysia has this land so it says it has all this water.

02:17.500 --> 02:20.740
Vietnam has this land so it says it has all this water.

02:20.740 --> 02:23.460
Brunei has this land so it says it has all this water.

02:23.460 --> 02:26.720
The Philippines has this land so it says it has all this water.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.780
When two countries are less than 400 nautical miles away from each other, it's up to them

02:30.780 --> 02:34.220
to decide where their respective economic zones end.

02:34.220 --> 02:37.820
Most solve it civilly by separating the zones at the equidistant point from each of their

02:37.820 --> 02:38.820
shores.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.780
However, when the stakes are so high, such as in the South China Sea, countries can be

02:42.780 --> 02:44.700
a bit less cordial.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.540
So, our cruise ship baby.

02:46.540 --> 02:50.620
Let's change the hypothetical and say that the cruise ship was sailing in US territorial

02:50.620 --> 02:53.380
waters, less than 12 miles away from shore.

02:53.380 --> 02:56.900
Every ocean-going vessel is required to be registered in some country.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.740
You'll notice that most large cruise ships are registered in tiny, faraway countries.

03:01.740 --> 03:07.660
Panama, a nation with fewer people than Minneapolis, holds the registration of one quarter of the

03:07.660 --> 03:10.800
world's ships because taxes and labor are low.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.100
When a ship is in international waters, the laws of the country of registration apply.

03:15.100 --> 03:19.600
A ship registered in Amsterdam could legally have prostitution and marijuana on board as

03:19.600 --> 03:23.640
long as they got rid of the drugs and shut down the brothels before sailing into territorial

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
waters.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.920
Once a ship is in the territorial waters of a country, the on-board laws switch to that

03:28.920 --> 03:31.420
of the country the ship is physically in.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.240
This is the same for nationality law, kinda.

03:34.240 --> 03:39.760
A baby born on a Dutch ship within 12 miles of the US is a baby born in America.

03:39.760 --> 03:44.200
Since the US is one of the 30 countries that unconditionally grant citizenship to any baby

03:44.200 --> 03:48.560
born within the country, a baby born in US territorial waters is lucky enough to receive

03:48.560 --> 03:50.960
the world's 8th most powerful passport.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.200
There are two exceptions to this rule.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.560
Foreign diplomats visiting or living in the US with a diplomatic passport are not subject

03:57.560 --> 04:01.600
to the laws of the US or any other nation other than their own.

04:01.600 --> 04:06.560
Consequently, the babies of foreign diplomats do not automatically receive American citizenship.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.720
Additionally, the babies of individuals staging a hostile invasion or occupation of American

04:11.720 --> 04:15.480
territory are not granted American citizenship upon birth.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.540
Here's where things get even more confusing.

04:18.540 --> 04:22.100
Even though a ship in international waters is an extension of the territory of the nation

04:22.100 --> 04:26.120
it's registered in law-wise, the rules for nationality are different.

04:26.120 --> 04:30.460
The United Nations Treaty on the Reduction of Statelessness, which is followed by some

04:30.460 --> 04:34.820
countries, says that a baby born in international waters should just take the nationality of

04:34.820 --> 04:36.060
their parents.

04:36.060 --> 04:39.880
Most of the world's countries use this principle of bloodline to determine if a baby should

04:39.880 --> 04:43.780
get citizenship rather than whether or not a baby was born in the country.

04:43.780 --> 04:48.420
However, there are some countries that won't give citizenship to a baby born outside the

04:48.420 --> 04:49.420
country.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.980
In that case, the baby would take the citizenship of the country in which the ship was registered.

04:52.980 --> 04:54.980
Alright, that's enough with babies.

04:54.980 --> 04:58.460
There's a long history of exploiting maritime laws.

04:58.460 --> 05:02.860
During prohibition, US ships started to change their registration to Panama and other foreign

05:02.860 --> 05:06.700
countries so they could serve alcohol in international waters.

05:06.700 --> 05:10.720
In the mid-century, casino boats left from many cities where gambling was illegal to

05:10.720 --> 05:14.020
partake in legal gambling in international waters.

05:14.020 --> 05:19.500
In 2005, entrepreneur Roger Green started Secode, a company that planned to evade US

05:19.500 --> 05:23.960
labor laws by placing an old cruise ship 12 miles off the coast of California.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.300
They would bring in foreign coders and house them in this ship where they would not have

05:27.300 --> 05:32.000
to abide by US wage laws or go through the difficult visa application process.

05:32.000 --> 05:37.080
The idea never came to fruition, but the technical legality of it just shows how convoluted maritime

05:37.080 --> 05:38.080
law is.

05:38.080 --> 05:40.740
The laws for airplanes are pretty much the same.

05:40.740 --> 05:45.820
Technically, once an airplane has taken off, the laws of the country of registration apply.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.660
The only law that applies and differs among countries is the drinking age.

05:49.660 --> 05:54.920
A British Airways flight from New York to London can serve alcohol to 18-year-olds however,

05:54.920 --> 05:59.340
in most cases, airlines choose to follow the laws of the origin country.

05:59.340 --> 06:04.420
Spacecraft also follow very similar laws and luckily, I have a whole other video just about

06:04.420 --> 06:05.540
space law.

06:05.540 --> 06:07.080

Please also be sure to check out my last video on why college is so expensive.

06:16.560 --> 06:20.400
It's a great video so please check it out if you haven't done so already.
