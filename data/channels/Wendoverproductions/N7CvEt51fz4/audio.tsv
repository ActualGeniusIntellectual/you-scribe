0	2420	I love making interesting videos.
2420	7860	The most interesting topics are often exceptionsâ€”deviations from the norm.
7860	11900	All of us live in countries where there are laws and rules and governing bodies telling
11900	14260	us what we can and can't do.
14260	19420	But 70% of the world is ocean where there are no countries, no governing bodies to tell
19420	20980	us what's right and wrong.
20980	23100	That's why maritime law exists.
23100	25160	Let's start with a hypothetical.
25160	29380	A baby is born on a cruise ship sailing in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.
29380	31900	What nationality does it take?
31900	35620	This is the coast of some fictional place in some fictional country governed by some
35620	37220	fictional government.
37220	41420	From this line, which is the water line at the lowest low tide, every country is allowed
41420	43860	12 miles of territorial waters.
43860	49160	It used to be 3 miles, the distance a cannon could shoot offshore, but that has since changed.
49160	51620	Those 12 miles are the property of a country.
51620	56320	They can do pretty much whatever they please in it and all domestic laws apply.
56320	60360	Ocean ships are, however, sometimes allowed to enter into these waters under the principle
60360	62020	of innocent passage.
62020	66200	If ships have an innocent purpose, which does not include fishing, polluting, weapons practice,
66200	70280	or spying, they are allowed to pass through the territorial waters of a foreign nation
70280	74800	without permission as long as they do so quickly and without stopping on shore.
74800	79320	Beyond the territorial waters, there is another 12 miles of the contiguous zone.
79320	84260	This zone allows a country to enforce laws as long as they fall into one of four categories.
84340	89260	If the laws have to do with customs, taxation, immigration, or pollution, they can be enforced
89260	90940	in the contiguous zone.
90940	95920	Beyond the contiguous waters is the exclusive economic zone, also known as the EEZ.
95920	98640	This zone extends 200 nautical miles from shore.
98640	102620	Beyond the territorial waters, the EEZ is in international waters.
102620	107580	However, only the country who holds the exclusive economic zone has the right to harvest natural
107580	109300	resources in the area.
109300	113020	This law was originally set up to help with disputes over fishing rights, but has since
113020	116300	been incredibly useful with the boom in oil drilling.
116300	121480	All these laws do, however, occasionally cause some disputes due to overlapping zones.
121480	125060	This is the South China Sea, an incredibly important waterway.
125060	128920	Nearly one third of the world's shipping traffic passes through it and it reportedly
128920	131520	has huge untapped oil reserves.
131520	134500	China has this land so it says it has all this water.
134500	137500	Malaysia has this land so it says it has all this water.
137500	140740	Vietnam has this land so it says it has all this water.
140740	143460	Brunei has this land so it says it has all this water.
143460	146720	The Philippines has this land so it says it has all this water.
146720	150780	When two countries are less than 400 nautical miles away from each other, it's up to them
150780	154220	to decide where their respective economic zones end.
154220	157820	Most solve it civilly by separating the zones at the equidistant point from each of their
157820	158820	shores.
158820	162780	However, when the stakes are so high, such as in the South China Sea, countries can be
162780	164700	a bit less cordial.
164700	166540	So, our cruise ship baby.
166540	170620	Let's change the hypothetical and say that the cruise ship was sailing in US territorial
170620	173380	waters, less than 12 miles away from shore.
173380	176900	Every ocean-going vessel is required to be registered in some country.
176900	181740	You'll notice that most large cruise ships are registered in tiny, faraway countries.
181740	187660	Panama, a nation with fewer people than Minneapolis, holds the registration of one quarter of the
187660	190800	world's ships because taxes and labor are low.
190800	195100	When a ship is in international waters, the laws of the country of registration apply.
195100	199600	A ship registered in Amsterdam could legally have prostitution and marijuana on board as
199600	203640	long as they got rid of the drugs and shut down the brothels before sailing into territorial
203640	204640	waters.
204640	208920	Once a ship is in the territorial waters of a country, the on-board laws switch to that
208920	211420	of the country the ship is physically in.
211420	214240	This is the same for nationality law, kinda.
214240	219760	A baby born on a Dutch ship within 12 miles of the US is a baby born in America.
219760	224200	Since the US is one of the 30 countries that unconditionally grant citizenship to any baby
224200	228560	born within the country, a baby born in US territorial waters is lucky enough to receive
228560	230960	the world's 8th most powerful passport.
230960	233200	There are two exceptions to this rule.
233200	237560	Foreign diplomats visiting or living in the US with a diplomatic passport are not subject
237560	241600	to the laws of the US or any other nation other than their own.
241600	246560	Consequently, the babies of foreign diplomats do not automatically receive American citizenship.
246560	251720	Additionally, the babies of individuals staging a hostile invasion or occupation of American
251720	255480	territory are not granted American citizenship upon birth.
255480	258540	Here's where things get even more confusing.
258540	262100	Even though a ship in international waters is an extension of the territory of the nation
262100	266120	it's registered in law-wise, the rules for nationality are different.
266120	270460	The United Nations Treaty on the Reduction of Statelessness, which is followed by some
270460	274820	countries, says that a baby born in international waters should just take the nationality of
274820	276060	their parents.
276060	279880	Most of the world's countries use this principle of bloodline to determine if a baby should
279880	283780	get citizenship rather than whether or not a baby was born in the country.
283780	288420	However, there are some countries that won't give citizenship to a baby born outside the
288420	289420	country.
289420	292980	In that case, the baby would take the citizenship of the country in which the ship was registered.
292980	294980	Alright, that's enough with babies.
294980	298460	There's a long history of exploiting maritime laws.
298460	302860	During prohibition, US ships started to change their registration to Panama and other foreign
302860	306700	countries so they could serve alcohol in international waters.
306700	310720	In the mid-century, casino boats left from many cities where gambling was illegal to
310720	314020	partake in legal gambling in international waters.
314020	319500	In 2005, entrepreneur Roger Green started Secode, a company that planned to evade US
319500	323960	labor laws by placing an old cruise ship 12 miles off the coast of California.
323960	327300	They would bring in foreign coders and house them in this ship where they would not have
327300	332000	to abide by US wage laws or go through the difficult visa application process.
332000	337080	The idea never came to fruition, but the technical legality of it just shows how convoluted maritime
337080	338080	law is.
338080	340740	The laws for airplanes are pretty much the same.
340740	345820	Technically, once an airplane has taken off, the laws of the country of registration apply.
345820	349660	The only law that applies and differs among countries is the drinking age.
349660	354920	A British Airways flight from New York to London can serve alcohol to 18-year-olds however,
354920	359340	in most cases, airlines choose to follow the laws of the origin country.
359340	364420	Spacecraft also follow very similar laws and luckily, I have a whole other video just about
364420	365540	space law.
