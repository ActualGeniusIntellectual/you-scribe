1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,420
I love making interesting videos.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:07,860
The most interesting topics are often exceptionsâ€”deviations from the norm.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,900
All of us live in countries where there are laws and rules and governing bodies telling

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,260
us what we can and can't do.

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,420
But 70% of the world is ocean where there are no countries, no governing bodies to tell

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,980
us what's right and wrong.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,100
That's why maritime law exists.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,160
Let's start with a hypothetical.

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,380
A baby is born on a cruise ship sailing in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,900
What nationality does it take?

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,620
This is the coast of some fictional place in some fictional country governed by some

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,220
fictional government.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:41,420
From this line, which is the water line at the lowest low tide, every country is allowed

14
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,860
12 miles of territorial waters.

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,160
It used to be 3 miles, the distance a cannon could shoot offshore, but that has since changed.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,620
Those 12 miles are the property of a country.

17
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,320
They can do pretty much whatever they please in it and all domestic laws apply.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,360
Ocean ships are, however, sometimes allowed to enter into these waters under the principle

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,020
of innocent passage.

20
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,200
If ships have an innocent purpose, which does not include fishing, polluting, weapons practice,

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,280
or spying, they are allowed to pass through the territorial waters of a foreign nation

22
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,800
without permission as long as they do so quickly and without stopping on shore.

23
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,320
Beyond the territorial waters, there is another 12 miles of the contiguous zone.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,260
This zone allows a country to enforce laws as long as they fall into one of four categories.

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,260
If the laws have to do with customs, taxation, immigration, or pollution, they can be enforced

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,940
in the contiguous zone.

27
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,920
Beyond the contiguous waters is the exclusive economic zone, also known as the EEZ.

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
This zone extends 200 nautical miles from shore.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,620
Beyond the territorial waters, the EEZ is in international waters.

30
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,580
However, only the country who holds the exclusive economic zone has the right to harvest natural

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,300
resources in the area.

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,020
This law was originally set up to help with disputes over fishing rights, but has since

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,300
been incredibly useful with the boom in oil drilling.

34
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,480
All these laws do, however, occasionally cause some disputes due to overlapping zones.

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,060
This is the South China Sea, an incredibly important waterway.

36
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,920
Nearly one third of the world's shipping traffic passes through it and it reportedly

37
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,520
has huge untapped oil reserves.

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,500
China has this land so it says it has all this water.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Malaysia has this land so it says it has all this water.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,740
Vietnam has this land so it says it has all this water.

41
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,460
Brunei has this land so it says it has all this water.

42
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,720
The Philippines has this land so it says it has all this water.

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,780
When two countries are less than 400 nautical miles away from each other, it's up to them

44
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:34,220
to decide where their respective economic zones end.

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,820
Most solve it civilly by separating the zones at the equidistant point from each of their

46
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,820
shores.

47
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,780
However, when the stakes are so high, such as in the South China Sea, countries can be

48
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,700
a bit less cordial.

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,540
So, our cruise ship baby.

50
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,620
Let's change the hypothetical and say that the cruise ship was sailing in US territorial

51
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,380
waters, less than 12 miles away from shore.

52
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,900
Every ocean-going vessel is required to be registered in some country.

53
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,740
You'll notice that most large cruise ships are registered in tiny, faraway countries.

54
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:07,660
Panama, a nation with fewer people than Minneapolis, holds the registration of one quarter of the

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,800
world's ships because taxes and labor are low.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,100
When a ship is in international waters, the laws of the country of registration apply.

57
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,600
A ship registered in Amsterdam could legally have prostitution and marijuana on board as

58
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,640
long as they got rid of the drugs and shut down the brothels before sailing into territorial

59
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
waters.

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,920
Once a ship is in the territorial waters of a country, the on-board laws switch to that

61
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,420
of the country the ship is physically in.

62
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,240
This is the same for nationality law, kinda.

63
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,760
A baby born on a Dutch ship within 12 miles of the US is a baby born in America.

64
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,200
Since the US is one of the 30 countries that unconditionally grant citizenship to any baby

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,560
born within the country, a baby born in US territorial waters is lucky enough to receive

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,960
the world's 8th most powerful passport.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,200
There are two exceptions to this rule.

68
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,560
Foreign diplomats visiting or living in the US with a diplomatic passport are not subject

69
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,600
to the laws of the US or any other nation other than their own.

70
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,560
Consequently, the babies of foreign diplomats do not automatically receive American citizenship.

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,720
Additionally, the babies of individuals staging a hostile invasion or occupation of American

72
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,480
territory are not granted American citizenship upon birth.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,540
Here's where things get even more confusing.

74
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,100
Even though a ship in international waters is an extension of the territory of the nation

75
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,120
it's registered in law-wise, the rules for nationality are different.

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,460
The United Nations Treaty on the Reduction of Statelessness, which is followed by some

77
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,820
countries, says that a baby born in international waters should just take the nationality of

78
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,060
their parents.

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,880
Most of the world's countries use this principle of bloodline to determine if a baby should

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,780
get citizenship rather than whether or not a baby was born in the country.

81
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,420
However, there are some countries that won't give citizenship to a baby born outside the

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
country.

83
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,980
In that case, the baby would take the citizenship of the country in which the ship was registered.

84
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
Alright, that's enough with babies.

85
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,460
There's a long history of exploiting maritime laws.

86
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,860
During prohibition, US ships started to change their registration to Panama and other foreign

87
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,700
countries so they could serve alcohol in international waters.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,720
In the mid-century, casino boats left from many cities where gambling was illegal to

89
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,020
partake in legal gambling in international waters.

90
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:19,500
In 2005, entrepreneur Roger Green started Secode, a company that planned to evade US

91
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,960
labor laws by placing an old cruise ship 12 miles off the coast of California.

92
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,300
They would bring in foreign coders and house them in this ship where they would not have

93
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,000
to abide by US wage laws or go through the difficult visa application process.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,080
The idea never came to fruition, but the technical legality of it just shows how convoluted maritime

95
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
law is.

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,740
The laws for airplanes are pretty much the same.

97
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,820
Technically, once an airplane has taken off, the laws of the country of registration apply.

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,660
The only law that applies and differs among countries is the drinking age.

99
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,920
A British Airways flight from New York to London can serve alcohol to 18-year-olds however,

100
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,340
in most cases, airlines choose to follow the laws of the origin country.

101
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,420
Spacecraft also follow very similar laws and luckily, I have a whole other video just about

102
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,540
space law.
