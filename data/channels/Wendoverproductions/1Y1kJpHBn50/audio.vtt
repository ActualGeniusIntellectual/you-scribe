00:06.940 --> 00:09.640
first two weeks of Blue Apron.

00:09.640 --> 00:15.440
In 2015, a bombshell report came out detailing how the TSA, the agency responsible for airport

00:15.440 --> 00:22.160
security in the US, missed 95% of drugs, explosives, weapons, and other prohibited items sent through

00:22.160 --> 00:23.960
their scanners in a test.

00:23.960 --> 00:28.360
In 2016, the same test was repeated with the same result.

00:28.360 --> 00:34.040
The following year, 2017, the test was repeated again with an improved success rate but still

00:34.040 --> 00:37.320
it let 70% of prohibited items through.

00:37.320 --> 00:42.520
In fact, within the US, there's no evidence that the TSA has ever prevented a terrorist

00:42.520 --> 00:47.360
attack and outside the US there are very few examples of physical airport security thwarting

00:47.360 --> 00:48.640
an attack.

00:48.640 --> 00:53.560
Airport security slows people down, increases cost, and yet does little to actually improve

00:53.560 --> 00:57.480
safety, so it's safe to say that airport security is broken.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
But why?

00:58.480 --> 01:02.600
Since the purpose of aviation is to get from one place to another, it's tough for a single

01:02.600 --> 01:04.560
country to regulate the industry.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.720
Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, does.

01:09.720 --> 01:15.040
All but two UN member countries, Liechtenstein and Dominica, are part of the ICIO so its

01:15.040 --> 01:17.600
regulations are more or less universal.

01:17.600 --> 01:22.200
They're the ones responsible for making sure that air transport works the same way

01:22.200 --> 01:27.400
all around the world, but what they require for airport security is rather incongcrete.

01:27.400 --> 01:31.800
They simply say, measures need to be established to prevent weapons, explosives, and any other

01:31.800 --> 01:36.360
dangerous devices, articles, or substances which may be used to commit an act of unlawful

01:36.360 --> 01:40.160
interference, the carriage and bearing of which is not authorized from being introduced

01:40.160 --> 01:44.320
by any means whatsoever onboard an aircraft engaged in civil aviation.

01:44.320 --> 01:48.840
Essentially, all they require is that before a passenger gets onboard a plane, the airport

01:48.840 --> 01:50.960
assures they don't have weapons.

01:50.960 --> 01:55.000
While the ICAO does determine whether this requirement has been fulfilled, it's up

01:55.000 --> 01:58.120
to each country to decide how they achieve that.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.320
In the US, airport security works like this.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.060
After check-in, a passenger goes to have their documents checked, puts their bags through

02:05.060 --> 02:09.980
an x-ray scanner, and walks through either a metal detector or millimeter wave scanner.

02:09.980 --> 02:14.360
There are potentially additional steps such as a pat-down or explosives residue test for

02:14.360 --> 02:17.680
some, but these three steps are how the process works for most.

02:17.680 --> 02:22.340
It is, though, important to note that, if you so choose, you can skip the metal detector

02:22.340 --> 02:27.180
or millimeter wave scanner step of the process and receive a pat-down instead.

02:27.180 --> 02:32.460
This is fully compliant with ICAO regulations since it does effectively screen an individual

02:32.460 --> 02:33.460
for weapons.

02:33.460 --> 02:39.180
In fact, an airport could hypothetically be compliant with ICAO regulations only by conducting

02:39.180 --> 02:43.540
physical bag searches and pat-downs since this does screen for weapons even if this

02:43.540 --> 02:46.360
would be slow, invasive, and unpopular.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.620
Some small airports actually do this for bags—they physically search them instead of passing

02:50.620 --> 02:52.300
them through an x-ray.

02:52.300 --> 02:57.660
The words security theater are thrown around a lot in regards to US airport security.

02:57.660 --> 03:02.000
This term is used pejoratively—it means that the TSA's function is to make airports

03:02.000 --> 03:03.200
look secure.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.540
But here's the thing—on paper, the TSA has done its job.

03:07.540 --> 03:12.240
There has not been a single death on a flight leaving from a US airport since 9-11 as a

03:12.240 --> 03:13.820
result of terrorism.

03:13.820 --> 03:18.380
In fact, in the same time period, there has not even been a single attempted terrorist

03:18.380 --> 03:23.900
attack on a flight leaving from a US airport—all have been on flights originating from abroad.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.940
So maybe the TSA is doing its function.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.020
Maybe the mere threat of being caught has been enough to thwart terrorists, or maybe

03:31.020 --> 03:33.740
terrorists have moved on from attacking airplanes.

03:33.740 --> 03:39.780
The US is certainly a prime target for terrorism, but there are more controversial nations.

03:39.780 --> 03:43.700
Israeli airport security is considered to be the best in the world.

03:43.700 --> 03:48.280
Despite being situated in one of the most politically contentious countries in the world

03:48.280 --> 03:53.160
no airplane leaving from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport has ever been hijacked or

03:53.160 --> 03:54.160
bombed.

03:54.160 --> 03:59.000
It's been attempted, but this airport's security is simply nearly impenetrable.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.040
What's most fascinating is that this airport is hardly using any super-advanced technology—they

04:05.040 --> 04:09.440
use the exact same metal detectors as the US and Europe, but they've focused on the

04:09.440 --> 04:10.720
human factor.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.760
Israel has come to realize that it's unfortunately easy to get weapons through airport security.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.280
Plastic explosives, non-metallic knives, and blunt weapons are just tough to detect

04:20.280 --> 04:24.760
so rather than focusing on the weapons that could be used for an attack, they focus on

04:24.760 --> 04:26.680
the people who could use them.

04:26.680 --> 04:31.840
At Ben Gurion airport, security starts before passengers even get to the airport.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.640
Cars pass through a security checkpoint a mile away from the airport entrance where

04:35.640 --> 04:39.520
guards inspect cars and look for any suspicious looking individuals.

04:39.520 --> 04:43.520
The minute passengers arrive at the airport, they're being watched already.

04:43.520 --> 04:47.720
Highly trained plainclothes officers roam around in the check-in area again searching

04:47.720 --> 04:50.680
for individuals acting abnormally or nervous.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.200
Then, before passengers are even allowed to check in, there's the interview.

04:55.200 --> 05:00.280
Anyone who's passed through Ben Gurion airport knows how intense this interview is, but it's

05:00.280 --> 05:05.240
likely the single greatest factor leading to the safety of Israeli airports.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.200
Passengers are first asked standard questions like what their jobs are, why they came to

05:09.200 --> 05:13.780
Israel, how long they stayed for, and if they pack their own bags and all the while,

05:13.780 --> 05:17.320
the security agent watches the passenger's face for reactions.

05:17.320 --> 05:22.520
They'll also probe deeper, asking why the passenger has been to various countries stamped

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
in their passport.

05:23.520 --> 05:28.800
They'll then ask oddly specific questions—what school they went to, when they last moved,

05:28.800 --> 05:30.360
what kind of car they have.

05:30.360 --> 05:33.800
These are all to see if the passenger is being honest about who they are.

05:33.800 --> 05:38.680
If a security officer senses hesitation or finds a hole in their story, they could deem

05:38.680 --> 05:40.800
the passenger a higher risk.

05:40.800 --> 05:45.260
Once passengers have completed their interview, a barcode is placed on the back of their passport

05:45.260 --> 05:48.020
that starts with a number from one to six.

05:48.020 --> 05:52.580
If it starts with one, the passenger is deemed a very low risk—this is almost only given

05:52.580 --> 05:57.600
to Israeli citizens—while if it starts with six, the passenger is deemed a very high risk

05:57.600 --> 06:00.820
and will be subjected to extremely thorough screening.

06:00.820 --> 06:05.340
While a lot of the risk determination has to do with the interview, profiling also plays

06:05.340 --> 06:06.340
into it.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.100
According to the Israeli security system, passengers are deemed higher risk if they

06:10.100 --> 06:15.460
are male, if they are traveling alone, if they are young, and most of all, if they are

06:15.460 --> 06:16.460
Arab.

06:16.460 --> 06:21.120
Israel unapologetically uses racial profiling in their risk assessment which has led to

06:21.120 --> 06:22.860
international condemnation.

06:22.860 --> 06:26.580
Israel, meanwhile, argues that this technique is effective.

06:26.580 --> 06:31.140
After all, the country has recently been at war with many of its Arabian neighbors.

06:31.140 --> 06:35.820
At the same time, though, it's almost impossible for an Arab traveler to pass through Ben-Gurion

06:35.820 --> 06:39.660
airport without getting deemed a number six security risk.

06:39.660 --> 06:44.640
Western non-Israeli individuals are also generally considered to be a higher security risk, typically

06:44.640 --> 06:47.100
receiving a four or five.

06:47.100 --> 06:50.340
After the interview, passengers are finally allowed to check in.

06:50.340 --> 06:55.120
Their checked bags are put through a standard x-ray and then are placed in a pressure chamber.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.640
The chamber's pressure is lowered to the level of pressurized aircraft—about the

06:58.640 --> 07:03.480
equivalent of 6,000 to 8,000 feet of altitude—to set off any explosives designed to trigger

07:03.480 --> 07:06.840
when a plane's cabin pressure is lower at cruising altitude.

07:06.840 --> 07:11.320
Meanwhile, the passenger passes through a standard x-ray or body scanner.

07:11.320 --> 07:15.800
This physical screening process is exactly the same as it would be in North America,

07:15.800 --> 07:20.080
Europe, or Asia—they just walk through the scanners and grab their bags.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.420
Those deemed a higher security risk—above three or four—likely would have their bags

07:24.420 --> 07:29.540
manually searched and then the highest risk individuals—five or sixes—are often taken

07:29.540 --> 07:33.040
aside for another round of questioning and a pat down.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.620
The security doesn't even stop when passengers board the plane.

07:36.620 --> 07:42.160
Like the US, Israel has a system of air marshals—armed security guards on planes—but unlike the

07:42.160 --> 07:46.980
US, at least in the case of El Al, Israel's national airline, there are air marshals on

07:46.980 --> 07:48.500
every single flight.

07:48.500 --> 07:52.240
They sit among the passengers, often near any that were identified at the airport as

07:52.240 --> 07:56.300
high risk, and they have alert buttons that communicate with the pilots in case of an

07:56.300 --> 07:57.720
attempted hijacking.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.800
If the marshals press this button, an alarm will go off in the cockpit and the pilots

08:01.800 --> 08:06.140
will often send the plane into a dive to knock the hijacker off their feet.

08:06.140 --> 08:10.520
This technique has successfully prevented terror attacks in the past.

08:10.520 --> 08:15.240
These air marshals secure the plane from the inside, but another system protects the outside.

08:15.240 --> 08:19.780
El Al's planes are installed with thermal flares that deploy when a radar detects an

08:19.780 --> 08:21.480
incoming missile.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.920
Thermal guided missiles will then target the flares instead of the plane.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.240
El Al and the other Israeli airlines also stay secure by having security officers at

08:29.240 --> 08:31.140
their destination airports.

08:31.140 --> 08:35.780
For departing passengers to Israel, they repeat much of the same security process as

08:35.780 --> 08:40.940
at Ben Gurion airport—conducting interviews, profiling, and assessing the risk of each

08:40.940 --> 08:41.940
passenger.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.780
At many foreign airports, these agents also physically screen luggage before handing it

08:45.780 --> 08:47.980
off to regular airport security.

08:47.980 --> 08:53.540
El Al, despite being the flag carrier of one of the most controversial nations in the world,

08:53.540 --> 09:00.700
had its last and only hijacking in 1968 and even this incident resulted in zero deaths.

09:00.700 --> 09:05.980
It and Ben Gurion airport are testaments to the fact that truly secure security is

09:05.980 --> 09:09.860
theoretically possible, but is it possible worldwide?

09:09.860 --> 09:14.100
Here's the thing about Tel Aviv's airport—it's not that big.

09:14.100 --> 09:19.100
20 million passengers pass through it each year making it only as busy as San Diego or

09:19.100 --> 09:20.660
Berlin Airport.

09:20.660 --> 09:25.020
These are not small airports, but they're not on the same scale as the world's largest

09:25.020 --> 09:27.340
like JFK, Heathrow, or Dubai.

09:27.500 --> 09:31.900
It's tough to determine if a system like what Israel has implemented could scale up

09:31.900 --> 09:33.840
to be used universally.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.960
What sure is that certain elements of the Israeli system would not work—most countries

09:37.960 --> 09:42.040
could not justify a system that relies so heavily on racial profiling.

09:42.040 --> 09:47.660
In many countries and US states, practices such as this are simply illegal, but still,

09:47.660 --> 09:52.140
airports and countries around the world are watching Israeli security methods closely.

09:52.140 --> 09:56.440
The US has already implemented a system of security interviews for many international

09:56.440 --> 10:01.640
flights to the US, however these are generally conducted by less trained contract workers.

10:01.640 --> 10:07.160
Brussels airport, after its terrorist bombing in 2016, now positions officers trained in

10:07.160 --> 10:09.680
behavioral detection at its entrances.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.140
Plenty of other airports have sent delegates to Ben Gurion airport to evaluate their security

10:14.140 --> 10:18.560
techniques as well and have quietly made changes to closer emulate Israel.

10:18.560 --> 10:23.560
But few ever stop to question if we even want an increase in airport security.

10:23.560 --> 10:27.120
If it comes at the expense of time, maybe we don't.

10:27.120 --> 10:32.800
As mentioned, the US has not had a successful terror attack on an airplane since 9-11.

10:32.800 --> 10:39.800
Worldwide, airplane hijackings are now almost non-existent, but security has a consequence.

10:39.800 --> 10:44.540
In the most direct way, tickets for every single flight leaving from a US airport include

10:44.540 --> 10:48.800
a $5.60 fee that goes towards paying for security.

10:48.800 --> 10:53.440
This may not be much in the scope of a multi-hundred dollar flight to Europe or Asia, but if the

10:53.440 --> 10:58.720
US ever wants to get to the point where Europe is of having $10 or $20 budget airline tickets

10:58.720 --> 11:02.340
between domestic destinations, this fee has to go.

11:02.340 --> 11:07.160
A study found that the TSA's average cost per life saved—how much money it spent to

11:07.160 --> 11:12.800
stop one human death—is $667 million.

11:12.800 --> 11:16.680
You can certainly say that you can't put a price on a human life, but the security

11:16.680 --> 11:20.140
that saves these lives costs lives.

11:20.140 --> 11:25.600
The plane is empirically the safest way to travel—it's hundreds or thousands of times

11:25.600 --> 11:31.360
safer than driving—so stopping people from flying is, in and of itself, deadly.

11:31.360 --> 11:36.940
Economists found that the increase in airport security in the US post-9-11 can account for

11:36.940 --> 11:39.660
6% of the decline in air travel.

11:39.660 --> 11:45.260
Given that, in 2002, more than 500 people died because, as a result of longer security

11:45.260 --> 11:50.620
times and more extensive searches, they chose to drive over fly and were involved in a fatal

11:50.620 --> 11:52.040
accident.

11:52.040 --> 11:57.480
Flying being easy helps everyone—it lets people travel faster and it helps airlines

11:57.480 --> 12:02.380
as businesses, just as long as it doesn't result in a decrease in safety.

12:02.380 --> 12:07.580
In Israel, passengers arrive three hours before their flights just to clear security which

12:07.580 --> 12:12.020
means plane travel is inefficient while in some places in Europe, airports encourage

12:12.020 --> 12:15.360
travelers to arrive a mere hour before their flight.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.740
The goal is to keep security fast, efficient, but also secure.

12:19.740 --> 12:25.060
No country or airport has the perfect system, but to achieve this, one likely needs to combine

12:25.060 --> 12:29.340
elements of the strictest security systems with those of the fastest.

12:29.340 --> 12:34.460
Israel can get away with invasive, unethical, yet effective security measures because they

12:34.460 --> 12:35.460
need to.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.740
They are a country seemingly constantly at war.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.340
Many other areas of the world just aren't big targets for terrorists.

12:42.340 --> 12:46.020
It's hard to know whether or not security measures are effective.

12:46.020 --> 12:50.640
There's no control group of developed countries that don't have airport security to compare

12:50.640 --> 12:51.640
to.

12:51.640 --> 12:56.160
The most effective security systems stop attacks by the mere threat of consequences rather

12:56.160 --> 13:00.660
than through physical screening so maybe airport security works.

13:00.660 --> 13:06.580
In the US, and Europe, and Asia, and all the other developed, safe areas of the world,

13:06.580 --> 13:12.940
one must therefore ask whether airport security is actually saving lives or ending them.

13:12.940 --> 13:16.500
If you've been watching this channel for a while you know about Blue Apron.

13:16.500 --> 13:21.340
I'm someone who hates to waste time which is part of the reason I love Blue Apron.

13:21.340 --> 13:25.580
With Blue Apron you receive a box full of pre-apportioned ingredients and recipes which

13:25.580 --> 13:29.680
you use to make fresh, delicious meals in 40 minutes or less.

13:29.680 --> 13:33.860
You skip all the boring parts like grocery shopping and measuring and get right to the

13:33.860 --> 13:37.060
great parts of cooking—actually cooking and eating.

13:37.060 --> 13:40.980
I've found with all the Blue Apron meals I've had that they're all unique recipes

13:40.980 --> 13:45.300
that I would never have thought of making myself although I've also never had a Blue

13:45.300 --> 13:49.460
Apron meal I didn't like since before you receive your meal each week you can select

13:49.460 --> 13:50.980
which ones you want online.
