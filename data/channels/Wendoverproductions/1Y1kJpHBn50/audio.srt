This video was made possible by Blue Apron.

The first 100 people to sign up at the link in the description will get $50 off their

00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,640
first two weeks of Blue Apron.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,440
In 2015, a bombshell report came out detailing how the TSA, the agency responsible for airport

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,160
security in the US, missed 95% of drugs, explosives, weapons, and other prohibited items sent through

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,960
their scanners in a test.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,360
In 2016, the same test was repeated with the same result.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,040
The following year, 2017, the test was repeated again with an improved success rate but still

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,320
it let 70% of prohibited items through.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,520
In fact, within the US, there's no evidence that the TSA has ever prevented a terrorist

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,360
attack and outside the US there are very few examples of physical airport security thwarting

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
an attack.

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,560
Airport security slows people down, increases cost, and yet does little to actually improve

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,480
safety, so it's safe to say that airport security is broken.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
But why?

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,600
Since the purpose of aviation is to get from one place to another, it's tough for a single

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,560
country to regulate the industry.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,720
Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, does.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,040
All but two UN member countries, Liechtenstein and Dominica, are part of the ICIO so its

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,600
regulations are more or less universal.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,200
They're the ones responsible for making sure that air transport works the same way

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,400
all around the world, but what they require for airport security is rather incongcrete.

23
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,800
They simply say, measures need to be established to prevent weapons, explosives, and any other

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,360
dangerous devices, articles, or substances which may be used to commit an act of unlawful

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,160
interference, the carriage and bearing of which is not authorized from being introduced

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,320
by any means whatsoever onboard an aircraft engaged in civil aviation.

27
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,840
Essentially, all they require is that before a passenger gets onboard a plane, the airport

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,960
assures they don't have weapons.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,000
While the ICAO does determine whether this requirement has been fulfilled, it's up

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,120
to each country to decide how they achieve that.

31
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,320
In the US, airport security works like this.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,060
After check-in, a passenger goes to have their documents checked, puts their bags through

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,980
an x-ray scanner, and walks through either a metal detector or millimeter wave scanner.

34
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:14,360
There are potentially additional steps such as a pat-down or explosives residue test for

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,680
some, but these three steps are how the process works for most.

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,340
It is, though, important to note that, if you so choose, you can skip the metal detector

37
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:27,180
or millimeter wave scanner step of the process and receive a pat-down instead.

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,460
This is fully compliant with ICAO regulations since it does effectively screen an individual

39
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,460
for weapons.

40
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:39,180
In fact, an airport could hypothetically be compliant with ICAO regulations only by conducting

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,540
physical bag searches and pat-downs since this does screen for weapons even if this

42
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,360
would be slow, invasive, and unpopular.

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,620
Some small airports actually do this for bags—they physically search them instead of passing

44
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,300
them through an x-ray.

45
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,660
The words security theater are thrown around a lot in regards to US airport security.

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,000
This term is used pejoratively—it means that the TSA's function is to make airports

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
look secure.

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,540
But here's the thing—on paper, the TSA has done its job.

49
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,240
There has not been a single death on a flight leaving from a US airport since 9-11 as a

50
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,820
result of terrorism.

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,380
In fact, in the same time period, there has not even been a single attempted terrorist

52
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,900
attack on a flight leaving from a US airport—all have been on flights originating from abroad.

53
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,940
So maybe the TSA is doing its function.

54
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,020
Maybe the mere threat of being caught has been enough to thwart terrorists, or maybe

55
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,740
terrorists have moved on from attacking airplanes.

56
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:39,780
The US is certainly a prime target for terrorism, but there are more controversial nations.

57
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,700
Israeli airport security is considered to be the best in the world.

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,280
Despite being situated in one of the most politically contentious countries in the world

59
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,160
no airplane leaving from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport has ever been hijacked or

60
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
bombed.

61
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,000
It's been attempted, but this airport's security is simply nearly impenetrable.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,040
What's most fascinating is that this airport is hardly using any super-advanced technology—they

63
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,440
use the exact same metal detectors as the US and Europe, but they've focused on the

64
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
human factor.

65
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,760
Israel has come to realize that it's unfortunately easy to get weapons through airport security.

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,280
Plastic explosives, non-metallic knives, and blunt weapons are just tough to detect

67
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,760
so rather than focusing on the weapons that could be used for an attack, they focus on

68
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,680
the people who could use them.

69
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:31,840
At Ben Gurion airport, security starts before passengers even get to the airport.

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,640
Cars pass through a security checkpoint a mile away from the airport entrance where

71
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,520
guards inspect cars and look for any suspicious looking individuals.

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,520
The minute passengers arrive at the airport, they're being watched already.

73
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,720
Highly trained plainclothes officers roam around in the check-in area again searching

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,680
for individuals acting abnormally or nervous.

75
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,200
Then, before passengers are even allowed to check in, there's the interview.

76
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,280
Anyone who's passed through Ben Gurion airport knows how intense this interview is, but it's

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,240
likely the single greatest factor leading to the safety of Israeli airports.

78
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,200
Passengers are first asked standard questions like what their jobs are, why they came to

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,780
Israel, how long they stayed for, and if they pack their own bags and all the while,

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,320
the security agent watches the passenger's face for reactions.

81
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,520
They'll also probe deeper, asking why the passenger has been to various countries stamped

82
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
in their passport.

83
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,800
They'll then ask oddly specific questions—what school they went to, when they last moved,

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,360
what kind of car they have.

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,800
These are all to see if the passenger is being honest about who they are.

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,680
If a security officer senses hesitation or finds a hole in their story, they could deem

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,800
the passenger a higher risk.

88
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,260
Once passengers have completed their interview, a barcode is placed on the back of their passport

89
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,020
that starts with a number from one to six.

90
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,580
If it starts with one, the passenger is deemed a very low risk—this is almost only given

91
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,600
to Israeli citizens—while if it starts with six, the passenger is deemed a very high risk

92
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,820
and will be subjected to extremely thorough screening.

93
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,340
While a lot of the risk determination has to do with the interview, profiling also plays

94
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340
into it.

95
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,100
According to the Israeli security system, passengers are deemed higher risk if they

96
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,460
are male, if they are traveling alone, if they are young, and most of all, if they are

97
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,460
Arab.

98
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,120
Israel unapologetically uses racial profiling in their risk assessment which has led to

99
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,860
international condemnation.

100
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,580
Israel, meanwhile, argues that this technique is effective.

101
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,140
After all, the country has recently been at war with many of its Arabian neighbors.

102
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,820
At the same time, though, it's almost impossible for an Arab traveler to pass through Ben-Gurion

103
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,660
airport without getting deemed a number six security risk.

104
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,640
Western non-Israeli individuals are also generally considered to be a higher security risk, typically

105
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,100
receiving a four or five.

106
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,340
After the interview, passengers are finally allowed to check in.

107
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,120
Their checked bags are put through a standard x-ray and then are placed in a pressure chamber.

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,640
The chamber's pressure is lowered to the level of pressurized aircraft—about the

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,480
equivalent of 6,000 to 8,000 feet of altitude—to set off any explosives designed to trigger

110
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,840
when a plane's cabin pressure is lower at cruising altitude.

111
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,320
Meanwhile, the passenger passes through a standard x-ray or body scanner.

112
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,800
This physical screening process is exactly the same as it would be in North America,

113
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,080
Europe, or Asia—they just walk through the scanners and grab their bags.

114
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,420
Those deemed a higher security risk—above three or four—likely would have their bags

115
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,540
manually searched and then the highest risk individuals—five or sixes—are often taken

116
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,040
aside for another round of questioning and a pat down.

117
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,620
The security doesn't even stop when passengers board the plane.

118
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,160
Like the US, Israel has a system of air marshals—armed security guards on planes—but unlike the

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,980
US, at least in the case of El Al, Israel's national airline, there are air marshals on

120
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,500
every single flight.

121
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,240
They sit among the passengers, often near any that were identified at the airport as

122
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,300
high risk, and they have alert buttons that communicate with the pilots in case of an

123
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,720
attempted hijacking.

124
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,800
If the marshals press this button, an alarm will go off in the cockpit and the pilots

125
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,140
will often send the plane into a dive to knock the hijacker off their feet.

126
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,520
This technique has successfully prevented terror attacks in the past.

127
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,240
These air marshals secure the plane from the inside, but another system protects the outside.

128
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,780
El Al's planes are installed with thermal flares that deploy when a radar detects an

129
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,480
incoming missile.

130
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,920
Thermal guided missiles will then target the flares instead of the plane.

131
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,240
El Al and the other Israeli airlines also stay secure by having security officers at

132
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,140
their destination airports.

133
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,780
For departing passengers to Israel, they repeat much of the same security process as

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,940
at Ben Gurion airport—conducting interviews, profiling, and assessing the risk of each

135
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
passenger.

136
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,780
At many foreign airports, these agents also physically screen luggage before handing it

137
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,980
off to regular airport security.

138
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:53,540
El Al, despite being the flag carrier of one of the most controversial nations in the world,

139
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,700
had its last and only hijacking in 1968 and even this incident resulted in zero deaths.

140
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,980
It and Ben Gurion airport are testaments to the fact that truly secure security is

141
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,860
theoretically possible, but is it possible worldwide?

142
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,100
Here's the thing about Tel Aviv's airport—it's not that big.

143
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,100
20 million passengers pass through it each year making it only as busy as San Diego or

144
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,660
Berlin Airport.

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,020
These are not small airports, but they're not on the same scale as the world's largest

146
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,340
like JFK, Heathrow, or Dubai.

147
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,900
It's tough to determine if a system like what Israel has implemented could scale up

148
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,840
to be used universally.

149
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,960
What sure is that certain elements of the Israeli system would not work—most countries

150
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,040
could not justify a system that relies so heavily on racial profiling.

151
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,660
In many countries and US states, practices such as this are simply illegal, but still,

152
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:52,140
airports and countries around the world are watching Israeli security methods closely.

153
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,440
The US has already implemented a system of security interviews for many international

154
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,640
flights to the US, however these are generally conducted by less trained contract workers.

155
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:07,160
Brussels airport, after its terrorist bombing in 2016, now positions officers trained in

156
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,680
behavioral detection at its entrances.

157
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,140
Plenty of other airports have sent delegates to Ben Gurion airport to evaluate their security

158
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,560
techniques as well and have quietly made changes to closer emulate Israel.

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,560
But few ever stop to question if we even want an increase in airport security.

160
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,120
If it comes at the expense of time, maybe we don't.

161
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,800
As mentioned, the US has not had a successful terror attack on an airplane since 9-11.

162
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Worldwide, airplane hijackings are now almost non-existent, but security has a consequence.

163
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,540
In the most direct way, tickets for every single flight leaving from a US airport include

164
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,800
a $5.60 fee that goes towards paying for security.

165
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,440
This may not be much in the scope of a multi-hundred dollar flight to Europe or Asia, but if the

166
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,720
US ever wants to get to the point where Europe is of having $10 or $20 budget airline tickets

167
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,340
between domestic destinations, this fee has to go.

168
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:07,160
A study found that the TSA's average cost per life saved—how much money it spent to

169
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,800
stop one human death—is $667 million.

170
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,680
You can certainly say that you can't put a price on a human life, but the security

171
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,140
that saves these lives costs lives.

172
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,600
The plane is empirically the safest way to travel—it's hundreds or thousands of times

173
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,360
safer than driving—so stopping people from flying is, in and of itself, deadly.

174
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,940
Economists found that the increase in airport security in the US post-9-11 can account for

175
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,660
6% of the decline in air travel.

176
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,260
Given that, in 2002, more than 500 people died because, as a result of longer security

177
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:50,620
times and more extensive searches, they chose to drive over fly and were involved in a fatal

178
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,040
accident.

179
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,480
Flying being easy helps everyone—it lets people travel faster and it helps airlines

180
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,380
as businesses, just as long as it doesn't result in a decrease in safety.

181
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,580
In Israel, passengers arrive three hours before their flights just to clear security which

182
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,020
means plane travel is inefficient while in some places in Europe, airports encourage

183
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,360
travelers to arrive a mere hour before their flight.

184
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,740
The goal is to keep security fast, efficient, but also secure.

185
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,060
No country or airport has the perfect system, but to achieve this, one likely needs to combine

186
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,340
elements of the strictest security systems with those of the fastest.

187
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,460
Israel can get away with invasive, unethical, yet effective security measures because they

188
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
need to.

189
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,740
They are a country seemingly constantly at war.

190
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,340
Many other areas of the world just aren't big targets for terrorists.

191
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,020
It's hard to know whether or not security measures are effective.

192
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,640
There's no control group of developed countries that don't have airport security to compare

193
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
to.

194
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,160
The most effective security systems stop attacks by the mere threat of consequences rather

195
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,660
than through physical screening so maybe airport security works.

196
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,580
In the US, and Europe, and Asia, and all the other developed, safe areas of the world,

197
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,940
one must therefore ask whether airport security is actually saving lives or ending them.

198
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,500
If you've been watching this channel for a while you know about Blue Apron.

199
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,340
I'm someone who hates to waste time which is part of the reason I love Blue Apron.

200
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,580
With Blue Apron you receive a box full of pre-apportioned ingredients and recipes which

201
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:29,680
you use to make fresh, delicious meals in 40 minutes or less.

202
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,860
You skip all the boring parts like grocery shopping and measuring and get right to the

203
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:37,060
great parts of cooking—actually cooking and eating.

204
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,980
I've found with all the Blue Apron meals I've had that they're all unique recipes

205
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,300
that I would never have thought of making myself although I've also never had a Blue

206
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,460
Apron meal I didn't like since before you receive your meal each week you can select

207
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,980
which ones you want online.

208
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,260
I'm confident really anyone will like Blue Apron and they are too so they're offering

209
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,300
the first 100 people who sign up at the link in the description $50 off their first two

210
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
weeks.

211
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,020
They make this show possible and also make a genuinely good product so once again, make

212
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:09,260
sure to at least check them out at the link in the description.

213
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,380
Thanks for watching and I'll see you again in three weeks for another Wendover Productions

214
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:13,820
video.
