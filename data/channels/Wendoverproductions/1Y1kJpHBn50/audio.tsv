6940	9640	first two weeks of Blue Apron.
9640	15440	In 2015, a bombshell report came out detailing how the TSA, the agency responsible for airport
15440	22160	security in the US, missed 95% of drugs, explosives, weapons, and other prohibited items sent through
22160	23960	their scanners in a test.
23960	28360	In 2016, the same test was repeated with the same result.
28360	34040	The following year, 2017, the test was repeated again with an improved success rate but still
34040	37320	it let 70% of prohibited items through.
37320	42520	In fact, within the US, there's no evidence that the TSA has ever prevented a terrorist
42520	47360	attack and outside the US there are very few examples of physical airport security thwarting
47360	48640	an attack.
48640	53560	Airport security slows people down, increases cost, and yet does little to actually improve
53560	57480	safety, so it's safe to say that airport security is broken.
57480	58480	But why?
58480	62600	Since the purpose of aviation is to get from one place to another, it's tough for a single
62600	64560	country to regulate the industry.
64560	69720	Instead, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, does.
69720	75040	All but two UN member countries, Liechtenstein and Dominica, are part of the ICIO so its
75040	77600	regulations are more or less universal.
77600	82200	They're the ones responsible for making sure that air transport works the same way
82200	87400	all around the world, but what they require for airport security is rather incongcrete.
87400	91800	They simply say, measures need to be established to prevent weapons, explosives, and any other
91800	96360	dangerous devices, articles, or substances which may be used to commit an act of unlawful
96360	100160	interference, the carriage and bearing of which is not authorized from being introduced
100160	104320	by any means whatsoever onboard an aircraft engaged in civil aviation.
104320	108840	Essentially, all they require is that before a passenger gets onboard a plane, the airport
108840	110960	assures they don't have weapons.
110960	115000	While the ICAO does determine whether this requirement has been fulfilled, it's up
115000	118120	to each country to decide how they achieve that.
118120	121320	In the US, airport security works like this.
121320	125060	After check-in, a passenger goes to have their documents checked, puts their bags through
125060	129980	an x-ray scanner, and walks through either a metal detector or millimeter wave scanner.
129980	134360	There are potentially additional steps such as a pat-down or explosives residue test for
134360	137680	some, but these three steps are how the process works for most.
137680	142340	It is, though, important to note that, if you so choose, you can skip the metal detector
142340	147180	or millimeter wave scanner step of the process and receive a pat-down instead.
147180	152460	This is fully compliant with ICAO regulations since it does effectively screen an individual
152460	153460	for weapons.
153460	159180	In fact, an airport could hypothetically be compliant with ICAO regulations only by conducting
159180	163540	physical bag searches and pat-downs since this does screen for weapons even if this
163540	166360	would be slow, invasive, and unpopular.
166360	170620	Some small airports actually do this for bags—they physically search them instead of passing
170620	172300	them through an x-ray.
172300	177660	The words security theater are thrown around a lot in regards to US airport security.
177660	182000	This term is used pejoratively—it means that the TSA's function is to make airports
182000	183200	look secure.
183200	187540	But here's the thing—on paper, the TSA has done its job.
187540	192240	There has not been a single death on a flight leaving from a US airport since 9-11 as a
192240	193820	result of terrorism.
193820	198380	In fact, in the same time period, there has not even been a single attempted terrorist
198380	203900	attack on a flight leaving from a US airport—all have been on flights originating from abroad.
203900	206940	So maybe the TSA is doing its function.
206940	211020	Maybe the mere threat of being caught has been enough to thwart terrorists, or maybe
211020	213740	terrorists have moved on from attacking airplanes.
213740	219780	The US is certainly a prime target for terrorism, but there are more controversial nations.
219780	223700	Israeli airport security is considered to be the best in the world.
223700	228280	Despite being situated in one of the most politically contentious countries in the world
228280	233160	no airplane leaving from Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport has ever been hijacked or
233160	234160	bombed.
234160	239000	It's been attempted, but this airport's security is simply nearly impenetrable.
239000	245040	What's most fascinating is that this airport is hardly using any super-advanced technology—they
245040	249440	use the exact same metal detectors as the US and Europe, but they've focused on the
249440	250720	human factor.
250720	255760	Israel has come to realize that it's unfortunately easy to get weapons through airport security.
255760	260280	Plastic explosives, non-metallic knives, and blunt weapons are just tough to detect
260280	264760	so rather than focusing on the weapons that could be used for an attack, they focus on
264760	266680	the people who could use them.
266680	271840	At Ben Gurion airport, security starts before passengers even get to the airport.
271840	275640	Cars pass through a security checkpoint a mile away from the airport entrance where
275640	279520	guards inspect cars and look for any suspicious looking individuals.
279520	283520	The minute passengers arrive at the airport, they're being watched already.
283520	287720	Highly trained plainclothes officers roam around in the check-in area again searching
287720	290680	for individuals acting abnormally or nervous.
290680	295200	Then, before passengers are even allowed to check in, there's the interview.
295200	300280	Anyone who's passed through Ben Gurion airport knows how intense this interview is, but it's
300280	305240	likely the single greatest factor leading to the safety of Israeli airports.
305240	309200	Passengers are first asked standard questions like what their jobs are, why they came to
309200	313780	Israel, how long they stayed for, and if they pack their own bags and all the while,
313780	317320	the security agent watches the passenger's face for reactions.
317320	322520	They'll also probe deeper, asking why the passenger has been to various countries stamped
322520	323520	in their passport.
323520	328800	They'll then ask oddly specific questions—what school they went to, when they last moved,
328800	330360	what kind of car they have.
330360	333800	These are all to see if the passenger is being honest about who they are.
333800	338680	If a security officer senses hesitation or finds a hole in their story, they could deem
338680	340800	the passenger a higher risk.
340800	345260	Once passengers have completed their interview, a barcode is placed on the back of their passport
345260	348020	that starts with a number from one to six.
348020	352580	If it starts with one, the passenger is deemed a very low risk—this is almost only given
352580	357600	to Israeli citizens—while if it starts with six, the passenger is deemed a very high risk
357600	360820	and will be subjected to extremely thorough screening.
360820	365340	While a lot of the risk determination has to do with the interview, profiling also plays
365340	366340	into it.
366500	370100	According to the Israeli security system, passengers are deemed higher risk if they
370100	375460	are male, if they are traveling alone, if they are young, and most of all, if they are
375460	376460	Arab.
376460	381120	Israel unapologetically uses racial profiling in their risk assessment which has led to
381120	382860	international condemnation.
382860	386580	Israel, meanwhile, argues that this technique is effective.
386580	391140	After all, the country has recently been at war with many of its Arabian neighbors.
391140	395820	At the same time, though, it's almost impossible for an Arab traveler to pass through Ben-Gurion
395820	399660	airport without getting deemed a number six security risk.
399660	404640	Western non-Israeli individuals are also generally considered to be a higher security risk, typically
404640	407100	receiving a four or five.
407100	410340	After the interview, passengers are finally allowed to check in.
410340	415120	Their checked bags are put through a standard x-ray and then are placed in a pressure chamber.
415120	418640	The chamber's pressure is lowered to the level of pressurized aircraft—about the
418640	423480	equivalent of 6,000 to 8,000 feet of altitude—to set off any explosives designed to trigger
423480	426840	when a plane's cabin pressure is lower at cruising altitude.
426840	431320	Meanwhile, the passenger passes through a standard x-ray or body scanner.
431320	435800	This physical screening process is exactly the same as it would be in North America,
435800	440080	Europe, or Asia—they just walk through the scanners and grab their bags.
440080	444420	Those deemed a higher security risk—above three or four—likely would have their bags
444420	449540	manually searched and then the highest risk individuals—five or sixes—are often taken
449540	453040	aside for another round of questioning and a pat down.
453040	456620	The security doesn't even stop when passengers board the plane.
456620	462160	Like the US, Israel has a system of air marshals—armed security guards on planes—but unlike the
462160	466980	US, at least in the case of El Al, Israel's national airline, there are air marshals on
466980	468500	every single flight.
468500	472240	They sit among the passengers, often near any that were identified at the airport as
472240	476300	high risk, and they have alert buttons that communicate with the pilots in case of an
476300	477720	attempted hijacking.
477720	481800	If the marshals press this button, an alarm will go off in the cockpit and the pilots
481800	486140	will often send the plane into a dive to knock the hijacker off their feet.
486140	490520	This technique has successfully prevented terror attacks in the past.
490520	495240	These air marshals secure the plane from the inside, but another system protects the outside.
495240	499780	El Al's planes are installed with thermal flares that deploy when a radar detects an
499780	501480	incoming missile.
501480	504920	Thermal guided missiles will then target the flares instead of the plane.
504920	509240	El Al and the other Israeli airlines also stay secure by having security officers at
509240	511140	their destination airports.
511140	515780	For departing passengers to Israel, they repeat much of the same security process as
515780	520940	at Ben Gurion airport—conducting interviews, profiling, and assessing the risk of each
520940	521940	passenger.
521940	525780	At many foreign airports, these agents also physically screen luggage before handing it
525780	527980	off to regular airport security.
527980	533540	El Al, despite being the flag carrier of one of the most controversial nations in the world,
533540	540700	had its last and only hijacking in 1968 and even this incident resulted in zero deaths.
540700	545980	It and Ben Gurion airport are testaments to the fact that truly secure security is
545980	549860	theoretically possible, but is it possible worldwide?
549860	554100	Here's the thing about Tel Aviv's airport—it's not that big.
554100	559100	20 million passengers pass through it each year making it only as busy as San Diego or
559100	560660	Berlin Airport.
560660	565020	These are not small airports, but they're not on the same scale as the world's largest
565020	567340	like JFK, Heathrow, or Dubai.
567500	571900	It's tough to determine if a system like what Israel has implemented could scale up
571900	573840	to be used universally.
573840	577960	What sure is that certain elements of the Israeli system would not work—most countries
577960	582040	could not justify a system that relies so heavily on racial profiling.
582040	587660	In many countries and US states, practices such as this are simply illegal, but still,
587660	592140	airports and countries around the world are watching Israeli security methods closely.
592140	596440	The US has already implemented a system of security interviews for many international
596440	601640	flights to the US, however these are generally conducted by less trained contract workers.
601640	607160	Brussels airport, after its terrorist bombing in 2016, now positions officers trained in
607160	609680	behavioral detection at its entrances.
609680	614140	Plenty of other airports have sent delegates to Ben Gurion airport to evaluate their security
614140	618560	techniques as well and have quietly made changes to closer emulate Israel.
618560	623560	But few ever stop to question if we even want an increase in airport security.
623560	627120	If it comes at the expense of time, maybe we don't.
627120	632800	As mentioned, the US has not had a successful terror attack on an airplane since 9-11.
632800	639800	Worldwide, airplane hijackings are now almost non-existent, but security has a consequence.
639800	644540	In the most direct way, tickets for every single flight leaving from a US airport include
644540	648800	a $5.60 fee that goes towards paying for security.
648800	653440	This may not be much in the scope of a multi-hundred dollar flight to Europe or Asia, but if the
653440	658720	US ever wants to get to the point where Europe is of having $10 or $20 budget airline tickets
658720	662340	between domestic destinations, this fee has to go.
662340	667160	A study found that the TSA's average cost per life saved—how much money it spent to
667160	672800	stop one human death—is $667 million.
672800	676680	You can certainly say that you can't put a price on a human life, but the security
676680	680140	that saves these lives costs lives.
680140	685600	The plane is empirically the safest way to travel—it's hundreds or thousands of times
685600	691360	safer than driving—so stopping people from flying is, in and of itself, deadly.
691360	696940	Economists found that the increase in airport security in the US post-9-11 can account for
696940	699660	6% of the decline in air travel.
699660	705260	Given that, in 2002, more than 500 people died because, as a result of longer security
705260	710620	times and more extensive searches, they chose to drive over fly and were involved in a fatal
710620	712040	accident.
712040	717480	Flying being easy helps everyone—it lets people travel faster and it helps airlines
717480	722380	as businesses, just as long as it doesn't result in a decrease in safety.
722380	727580	In Israel, passengers arrive three hours before their flights just to clear security which
727580	732020	means plane travel is inefficient while in some places in Europe, airports encourage
732020	735360	travelers to arrive a mere hour before their flight.
735360	739740	The goal is to keep security fast, efficient, but also secure.
739740	745060	No country or airport has the perfect system, but to achieve this, one likely needs to combine
745060	749340	elements of the strictest security systems with those of the fastest.
749340	754460	Israel can get away with invasive, unethical, yet effective security measures because they
754460	755460	need to.
755460	758740	They are a country seemingly constantly at war.
758740	762340	Many other areas of the world just aren't big targets for terrorists.
762340	766020	It's hard to know whether or not security measures are effective.
766020	770640	There's no control group of developed countries that don't have airport security to compare
770640	771640	to.
771640	776160	The most effective security systems stop attacks by the mere threat of consequences rather
776160	780660	than through physical screening so maybe airport security works.
780660	786580	In the US, and Europe, and Asia, and all the other developed, safe areas of the world,
786580	792940	one must therefore ask whether airport security is actually saving lives or ending them.
792940	796500	If you've been watching this channel for a while you know about Blue Apron.
