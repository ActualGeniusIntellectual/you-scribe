0	5240	Sitting in the center of a maze of dirt roads, shantytowns, crumbling infrastructure, open
5240	12700	sewers, and trash fires, central Rwanda, circa 2015, was defined by opulence.
12700	17780	Three times a week, a specially configured 747 would speed 14 hours across the Atlantic
17780	24060	from Houston, depositing up to 189 passengers at Angola's International Airport—an unusually
24060	28380	low number for this aircraft, reflecting its unusually luxurious interior.
28380	33700	It spent first-class seats, 143 business, and just 36 in economy.
33700	38460	The Houston Express, as it was dubbed, operated as a charter accessible only to invitees of
38460	42560	Angola's national oil company, the Sonangol Group, and for the convenience of a non-stop
42560	50220	flight to or from America's oil capital, they charged an eye-popping $2,399 for a round-trip
50220	55260	economy-class ticket—roughly equivalent to half a year of income for the average Angolan.
55700	58540	But these passengers were rarely Angolan.
58540	64540	Rather, American oil executives, businesspeople, and their families filled the 189 seats, returning
64540	67900	from a visit to their home offices or hometowns.
67900	72220	Having cleared customs, most would instruct their taxis to turn left, or south, towards
72220	76340	their gated community of choice in the polished Talatona neighborhood.
76340	81020	Inside these walls, snaking streets dotted by Range Rovers, BMWs, and Porsches opened
81020	86620	up to suburban-style housing, featuring manicured lawns, backyard pools, tennis courts, backup
86620	92060	generators, water treatment systems, and 24-7 security—an approximate impression of average
92060	98000	American housing, offered for a far higher than average $10,000 or $20,000 American dollars
98000	99220	a month.
99220	104340	Come evening, Talatona's residents might head to dinner at Cafe Del Mar, PIMS, UNDA,
104340	108900	or even the city's yacht club—a walled enclave of luxury carved out of a landscape
108900	110780	of tin-roofed shacks.
110780	115920	Regardless of the restaurant of choice, one couldn't escape for less than $100 a head.
115920	121060	On a budget-conscious night, one could head to KFC, but still, a meal there went for some
121060	123180	$20 a person.
123180	127620	Home cooking was also an option, but the comforts of home would cost you—a liter of Coke went
127620	131700	for $10, while a pint of Häggendoss $17.
131700	135540	While the adults of Talatona would typically commute into downtown Luanda to work in some
135540	139600	the most expensive office space in the world, their kids would typically stay closer to
139600	142660	home to attend the Luanda International School.
142660	146980	English-language, American-accredited, international baccalaureate curriculum was taught by an
146980	152180	international collection of teachers in a sprawling, modern, polished campus.
152180	158460	Tuition averaged some $50,000 a year, equivalent to 11 Angolans' average annual income, but
158460	162260	it was often paid by the pupils' parents' employers, as it was the only school in the
162260	166560	city to regularly send graduates to Stanford, Columbia, and Oxford.
166560	173100	The wealth of the Luanda elite was, simply put, extraordinary—and so too were the means
173100	175700	by which Luanda got to this point.
175700	180980	Until recently, Luanda was less a destination for the world's elite, and more so a destination
180980	184060	for deadly military ordnance.
184060	188460	Entering the 1970s, even at the height of decolonization, it would have been hard to
188460	192940	imagine Luanda as the capital of a single, sovereign Angola.
192940	197020	Entering this century, Luanda would have seemed one of the least likely of African capitals
197020	201780	to have its downtown dotted with high-end hotels and streets crisscrossed by BMWs and
201780	202900	Porsches.
202900	208540	The bloody, drawn-out process of Angolan independence began in earnest here.
208540	214420	On January 4, 1961, where a protest over farm wages devolved into violence that spread across
214420	219600	northern Angola, before a brutal Portuguese response stopped the rebellion in its tracks.
219600	224340	The months-long revolt signaled the upswelling of a nascent Angolan nationalism, while its
224340	229680	violent conclusion hinted at the uphill battle such a movement would face going forward.
229680	233760	In the years that followed this first rural revolt, a series of independence movements
233760	236080	took shape across Angola.
236080	240900	The FNLA, the main combatant group in 1961, formed in the north and coalesced around a
240900	243220	shared Bakongo ethnicity.
243220	249020	From Luanda came the MPLA, a Marxist-Leninist group made up largely of Angolan intelligentsia,
249020	253880	and in central Angola was UNITA, a group of FNLA dissidents who rallied around their Uvumbundu
253880	255020	ethnic background.
255020	261200	For the next decade, each group took on Portuguese military and Portuguese-funded paramilitaries.
261200	266180	Because of such stark ideological and ethnic divides, though, each group did so individually,
266180	268740	and each, in turn, failed.
268740	273860	By 1974, Portuguese forces had pushed each of these factions to the very brink.
273860	279680	Then, unexpectedly, Portugal itself fell in a military coup, and with the old regime went
279680	283120	any interest in maintaining the nation's African colonies.
283120	289000	After 400 years, Angola's colonial period was suddenly coming to a close.
289000	293420	The ethnic and ideological divides that had fragmented their independence movement, however,
293420	295340	weren't going anywhere.
296100	300660	Forty years before it was known for the luxurious oil-funded Houston Express service, Luanda's
300660	304660	airport appeared in the media as a chaotic, miserably crowded departure point for some
304660	309020	200,000 Portuguese-Angolans fleeing from an impending war.
309020	312900	Just months later, on the eve of Angola's official independence, the decision to leave
312900	318300	proved prudent as the MPLA rushed the capital, pushed the FNLA out of Luanda, and named the
318300	321760	nation's new president, Agostino Neto.
321760	326980	It was the first major move of what would be a decades-long civil war.
326980	331140	From the start, the war took on an international bent, as thousands of Cuban soldiers and two
331140	336040	Yugoslavian warships bolstered the Marxist-Leninist hold over the capital, while South Africa,
336040	341680	Zaire, and, through covert funding, the US, all backed the now-allied FNLA and UNITA.
341680	346560	A hotspot in the Cold War, Angolan territory flipped between UNITA and MPLA forces practically
346560	351160	every battle, every offensive, and every year, as aid from various world powers bolstered
351200	354020	both parties' ability to keep fighting.
354020	358200	Between the occasional ceasefire or failed negotiation, the war carried through the 70s
358200	359200	and 80s.
359200	363800	Without either side able to claim a defensive victory, it stretched into the 90s.
363800	368520	As the Cold War closed, Angola's civil war lost its ideological edge and international
368520	369520	appeal.
369520	374000	Angola's president, José Eduardo dos Santos, who had led the MPLA government since Neto's
374000	379000	death in 1979, liberalized much of the Angolan economy, while UNITA carried on without the
379000	383160	money from the West, instead funding their war efforts through the diamond trade.
383160	387560	In 2002, with the assassination of its longtime leader, with increasingly tight sanctions
387560	393400	on its diamond trade, and without a real cause to fight for, UNITA entered peace talks.
393400	399320	After nearly 30 years, the Angolan civil war came sputtering to a close, accomplishing
399320	401280	remarkably little.
401280	405360	The same party remained in power, the same president remained in office, while a third
405360	409000	of the nation's population had now been internally displaced, two-thirds didn't
409000	413500	have access to running water, and life expectancy hovered in the 40s.
413500	418440	Late to gain its independence, and mired by three decades of ruthless civil war, 21st
418440	421680	century Angola was desperately behind.
421680	427340	Now, for as long as Angola's been a country, it's been an oil economy.
427340	431720	In fact, by the time the civil war ended, Angola was nearing its 100th anniversary of
431720	433660	commercial oil production.
433660	437580	Even during the war, as landmines littered the countryside and deadly violence occurred
437580	442060	daily, international oil giants like Shell and Chevron braved the conditions on account
442060	445100	of the profit opportunity Angola afforded.
445100	449140	Onshore oil fields were frequently attacked and destroyed, but much of the country's
449140	453860	oil was located offshore, beneath hundreds or thousands of feet of ocean.
453860	458520	So, focus gravitated offshore, where the liquid gold could be extracted in relative safety
458520	460140	throughout the conflict.
460140	464900	Ironically, however, the oil industry itself prolonged their biggest obstacle to increase
464900	469060	production as they funded the MPLA's war machine through the drilling fees they paid
469060	470060	them.
470060	475660	But, when the war finally ended, when peace was found, that obstacle was removed.
475660	479660	Without the civil war necessitating burdensome security contractors and expensive hardship
479660	486040	wages, oil production in Angola immediately grew far cheaper and far easier.
486040	489060	Profiteers the world over jumped on the opportunity.
489060	493140	So, Angola and its international partners planned for new rigs and expanded operations,
493140	497420	which came at the perfect time as the West, and especially America, looked to distance
497420	501000	itself from Middle Eastern oil in the wake of 9-11.
501000	505700	President dos Santos was even invited by Bush to the Oval Office to discuss that very subject.
505700	510580	Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, China also identified the opportunity.
510580	514980	Just months after the war officially ended, it signed a $2 billion loan agreement with
514980	518540	Angola, using its future oil production as collateral.
518580	522940	It put the country in a strategic tug-of-war between two of the world's great powers.
522940	527340	Within three short years, the post-war economy was kicking into high gear.
527340	531540	2005's oil production figures were already double those of the civil war era, and the
531540	538940	country recorded its highest GDP jump in history—the economy expanded some 15% in just 12 months.
538940	543580	Soon after, Angola overtook Saudi Arabia to become China's largest oil provider, while
543580	547340	the country's first shopping mall opened in the center of the quickly-developing, upscale
547340	548740	Talatona neighborhood.
548740	554020	Angola's position as a new oil giant was solidified as it joined the organization of
554020	558820	the petroleum-exporting countries—a global price-fixing cartel including Iraq, Saudi
558820	561460	Arabia, the UAE, and others.
561460	565740	By the 2010s, La Wanda Skyline had been thoroughly transformed.
565740	569700	Glass-fronted skyscrapers stretched hundreds of feet into the sky, filled with modern apartments
569700	573300	selling for millions or tens of millions of dollars.
573300	577700	Five-star hotels now offered visiting executives accommodations on par with those in Houston,
577700	581600	Calgary, Abu Dhabi, or the other oil capitals of the world.
581600	586020	Even the global financial crisis barely shook La Wanda from its path, as the global economy
586020	588660	shrank, and Angola still eked out growth.
588660	595440	It was one of the fastest-growing, fastest-developing, fastest-changing countries in the world.
595440	601300	Others had experienced oil booms, but none went from civil war to helipad-laden $10 million
601300	604580	in penthouse apartments in less than a decade.
604580	609080	Some asked if La Wanda was on track to become the Dubai of Africa—a place that, just a
609080	613580	few more years into the future, would have Lamborghinis on every block, five-star hotels
613580	618980	from every international brand, and Michelin-starred restaurants from all the globe's best chefs.
618980	623260	Others, however, started asking a different question.
623260	626420	What had this boom done for everyone else?
626420	631820	Among the expats and oil executives and politicians and businesspeople, how had life changed for
631820	637180	the everyday Angolan—the other 99.5% of the country?
637180	646460	Well, between 2002 and 2010, Angola's economy grew 534%, but, of course, GDP is not a useful
646460	650020	metric for assessing the quality of life of the everyday person.
650020	654900	What is is the Human Development Index, which combines metrics related to health, education,
654900	657620	and standard of living into a composite score?
657620	661140	Angola's in 2002 was 0.426 out of 1.
661140	664180	By 2010, it was 0.517.
664180	666820	It had jumped more than 20%.
666820	668700	But so did the rest of the world's.
668700	674500	Looking relatively, Angola ranked 154th in the world for HDI in 2002.
674500	678100	In 2010, it ranked higher—by four places.
678100	684860	That's to say, the economy was now $66 billion larger, but somehow, the everyday Angolan
684860	688540	was doing just about the same.
688540	693100	This was baffling, and an embarrassment for the country's triumphant leadership.
693100	697580	When the United Nations Development Program released data indicating that just 19% of
697580	702020	men and 15% of women in the country attained a high school-level education, the government
702020	705700	disputed the figures, saying the UN had an incorrect methodology.
705700	710660	But the embarrassments kept stacking—the facade started to fall.
710700	715840	2010 was supposed to be a watershed year for Angola as it hosted the Africa Cup of Nations,
715840	718720	the third largest soccer tournament in existence.
718720	724240	It was supposed to be the clearest indication yet that Angola was safe, developed, and open
724240	728400	to the world, but in the days leading up to its start, as Togo's national team traveled
728400	733140	to their opening match, separatists gunned down their bus as it passed through Cabinda,
733140	736020	killing three of their traveling party.
736020	740620	This incident cast a dark shadow on the typically jubilant tournament, and was positioned in
740620	744920	international media as an indicator that, despite all the pomp and circumstance of the
744920	751380	new Rwanda, deep down, Angola was still the same underdeveloped, impoverished, violent
751380	754260	country of a decade before.
754260	759260	For a decade, the success stories drowned out failures, but failures began to mount,
759260	762180	and as they did, they became harder to ignore.
762180	766420	2012 brought coverage of what was believed to be the most expensive apartment sale on
766420	769140	the African continent to date in Rwanda.
769140	772680	But acknowledging the difficulty the real estate boom presented to housing everyone
772680	777780	else, Dos Santos had promised in his 2008 presidential campaign to build a million homes
777780	779540	by 2012.
779540	784940	In 2012, however, even the pared-down post-election version of this promise faltered.
784940	788820	The first 2,800 apartments went up for sale in the brand-new Kalama neighborhood, which
788820	792900	would eventually have capacity for 200,000 working-class residents.
792900	797900	At six months in, just 220 of those homes had been sold, due to the fact that the very
797900	801860	working-class residents they were built for couldn't afford or finance them.
801860	807300	But the next year, Angola was celebrated the world over, as Isabel Dos Santos, the president's
807300	812380	daughter, had become the first African woman ever to make the Forbes billionaires list,
812380	816580	with an estimated net worth north of $3 billion.
816580	820840	It wasn't South Africa, or Nigeria, or any of the continent's other traditional centers
820840	825720	of wealth to earn this honor, but rather tiny, scrappy Angola.
825720	830300	Dos Santos owned significant stakes in banks, media companies, and sale providers in Angola
830300	834840	and Portugal—a home on the private island of the exclusive Bulgari Resort in Dubai,
834840	839920	a $16 million home in the affluent Kensington neighborhood of London, a comparatively modest
839920	845360	$1.8 million penthouse apartment in Lisbon, a $55 million villa just steps away from the
845360	852080	Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco, and to go with it, a $35 million, 50-meter, 164-foot
852080	854400	yacht anchored in the Mediterranean below.
854400	860400	And in 2016, her fortunes, both literal and figurative, only increased as her father fired
860400	867120	the entire board of Sonigal, Angola's national oil company, and replaced it with a sole chairwoman—Isabel
867120	869160	Dos Santos herself.
869160	873200	She was now in charge of the most powerful company in the country, making her perhaps
873200	877360	the country's second most powerful person after her father himself.
877360	882720	However, just months earlier, he had announced his imminent retirement.
882720	887680	Jose Eduardo Dos Santos would pass the torch, and Angola would have a new president—for
887680	891020	the first time in 38 years.
891020	895480	The president and his party planned for longtime MKLA politician João Lorenzo to take the
895480	899400	reins, which he did on September 26, 2017.
899400	902280	But then things went less to plan.
902280	906420	Isabel Dos Santos was quickly fired from her leading position at Sonigal, while her
906420	910760	half-brother, who had been leading the country's sovereign wealth fund, was arrested on corruption
910760	913200	and money laundering charges.
913200	918200	Out of nowhere, João Lorenzo turned on the Dos Santos family, and asked the question
918200	923960	no powerful MPLA leader had ever dared—was it merely a coincidence that Africa's wealthiest
923960	929040	woman was the daughter of Angola's most powerful man, or was something more nefarious
929040	930360	going on?
930360	934340	Quietly, this question had been circling around the international business community
934340	940080	for years, and by the mid-2010s, some were formulating informed opinions.
940080	943880	Western banks like Citigroup and Berkeley backed out of deals with the businesswoman,
943880	948320	InterTrust and ING closed accounts linked to her and her husband, and Sonigal officials
948320	952600	rallied against Dos Santos' alleged mismanagement of funds.
952600	957720	For her part, Dos Santos pushed back, arguing that claims of illegality were unfounded and
957720	960360	that the banks had anti-African biases.
960360	967040	Then, in 2020, as rumors swirled, accusations mounted, and investigations dug deeper, the
967040	971300	world was offered its clearest view yet into Dos Santos' business dealings through a
971300	975840	landslide of private documents called the Luanda Leaks.
975840	979800	Captured by a notorious Portuguese whistleblower, passed through the Paris-based platform to
979800	984360	protect whistleblowers in Africa, then analyzed and disseminated by the International Consortium
984360	989840	of Investigative Journalists, the 715,000 leaked memos, emails, contracts, and meeting
989840	994600	minutes corroborated many of the suspicions and outright accusations lobbed at the former
994600	996400	president's daughter.
996400	1000840	At practically every turn in her empire-building career, the documents showed, Isabel Dos Santos
1000840	1005860	benefited from insider dealmaking that landed her one massive government contract after
1005860	1007280	the next.
1007280	1012800	In 1999, there was the brand new mobile phone company Unitel, of which she owned a 25% share,
1012800	1016300	being granted a valuable telecoms license by the government.
1016300	1021000	In 2015, there was the Isabel Dos Santos-led urban redevelopment project being greenlit
1021000	1027360	by presidential decree that, the leaked documents later showed, was drafted by her own lawyers.
1027360	1032680	At every opportunity, major government undertakings seemingly designed to help everyday Angolans
1032680	1036560	were being routed through various Isabel Dos Santos holdings.
1036560	1040680	Beyond the murky, uncompetitive doling out of government contracts, Dos Santos and her
1040680	1044880	husband Sandika Dokolo further bolstered their own wealth through fraudulent deals
1044880	1050920	and creative accounting which, in turn, further stunted the development of the Angolan economy.
1050920	1055200	In addition to the $1 billion in dividends Dos Santos made, and the $1 billion stake
1055200	1059780	she still owned in Unitel, now the nation's largest telecom provider, Dos Santos also
1059780	1064400	went ahead and set up another company called Unitel International Holdings, which she lent
1064400	1071000	upwards of $460 million from Unitel, signing off as both the lender and the borrower and
1071000	1074300	leaving the Unitel board utterly dumbfounded.
1074300	1078580	The money made from shady insider deals like this then went on to cycle through or open
1078580	1082600	a vast array of shell companies in places like the British Virgin Islands and Malta,
1082600	1086800	where tax burdens and government oversight would be low or nonexistent.
1086800	1090680	This international expansion, leaks would prove, explained why companies like Malta's
1090680	1094940	Wise Intelligent Solutions, with herself and her husband as sole shareholders and only
1094940	1099180	a handful of staff with no expertise in oil, were being awarded contracts to restructure
1099180	1102280	a floundering Senegal in 2015.
1102280	1106640	All told, the ICIJ analysis of the Luanda leaks claimed that the Dos Santos and Dokolo
1106640	1111560	empire was made up of more than 400 companies and subsidiaries, spanning 41 countries with
1111560	1116040	at least 94 stashed in secrecy jurisdictions like Malta.
1116040	1121120	Despite painstakingly poring over these 70,000 documents, journalists helped to substantiate
1121120	1125680	what skeptical onlookers have been claiming since 2013—that the Dos Santos empire was
1125680	1128040	hardly something to be celebrated.
1128040	1132160	Rather than a signal that Angola was on the rise, Isabel Dos Santos' ill-gotten wealth
1132160	1136660	was actually going a long way in keeping average Angolans down.
1136660	1142080	In late 2020, President Lorenzo claimed that the government of José Eduardo Dos Santos
1142080	1148400	had squandered away and outright stolen an estimated $24 billion of the Angolan government,
1148400	1151200	and therefore the Angolan people's money.
1151200	1156700	Angola's story is tragically unoriginal—an African country that strikes it rich with
1156700	1162600	natural resources, but where poverty and pain persist for all but the powerful few.
1162600	1168040	Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, Zambia—the same narrative plays out time
1168040	1173480	and time again across the continent, crippling the people's futures.
1173480	1178440	This natural wealth-economic poverty paradox is so common in development economics that
1178440	1182800	it has a name, the resource curse, and while this continent propagates the phenomenon,
1182800	1185120	it's observed globally.
1185120	1190440	Simply, natural resources rarely propel people out of poverty.
1190440	1193900	But today, there's the benefit of hindsight.
1193900	1199740	Education and cronyism is now identifiably the evil holding the people back, so as dictators
1199740	1206060	die out, democracies across Africa have the opportunity to try something new.
1206060	1211420	On August 24th, 2022, Angolans will head to their polling places to decide whether Joao
1211420	1217180	Lorenzo and his MPLA party will earn a second term, or if UNITA, for the first time ever,
1217180	1219980	will take control of the country.
1220060	1224740	Arrigingly, both parties' campaigns are centered around defeating corruption.
1224740	1229020	While one candidate points to his past action investigating and punishing his predecessors,
1229020	1232820	the other says he didn't go far enough, and is charting out a path for more systematic
1232820	1234020	reform.
1234020	1238900	Angola has a long way to go, and starting from behind, but the oil's still there,
1238900	1243100	it's still producing millions of barrels per day, and billions are still left in the
1243100	1244100	ground.
1244100	1247860	If the people can accurately predict which candidate will stick to their word, which
1247860	1252100	candidate will find a path to turn natural wealth into human wealth, then all is not
1252100	1259020	lost for Angola—it still has a chance of breaking the resource curse.
1259020	1262580	If you're anything like me, you probably spend an embarrassing amount of time scrolling
1262580	1265380	through streaming sites trying to find something good to watch.
1265380	1269300	Well, to stop you from doing that tonight, I have a seminal list of a whole evening's
1269300	1272820	worth of entertainment that any Wendover viewer is sure to enjoy.
1272820	1276660	To start out with, there's the first episode of our new season of Extremities, which does
1276660	1281380	a deep dive into why the US holds onto the tiny, mid-Pacific territory of Wake Island
1281380	1284540	through first-hand interviews with those who have lived and worked there.
1284540	1288260	A small hint—it has a whole lot to do with airplanes.
1288260	1291860	Next you should give the latest episode of PolyMatter's series China Axia Watch, where
1291860	1296540	he explains how the country manages to survive and thrive with essentially zero major international
1296540	1297540	allies.
1297540	1301560	Finally, you should watch Half as Interesting's Crime Spree, the pilot season of our travel
1301560	1305560	competition show Jet Lag, where my writers chase me across the country as I attempt to
1305560	1307740	complete challenges as I go.
1307740	1313040	Each of these, and so much more, is exclusive to either Nebula or CuriosityStream, two fantastic
1313040	1314340	streaming sites.
1314340	1317840	The first was founded by myself and a bunch of other educational creators to be the best
1317840	1321500	home to the stuff we make, allowing us to make higher-budget, more controversial, more
1321500	1325280	unique or other sorts of videos that just don't work on YouTube.
1325280	1328920	Meanwhile, CuriosityStream was founded by the same people as Discovery Channel, and
1328920	1333440	hosts all sorts of fantastic STEM-oriented documentaries and shows, including our series
1333440	1334440	Extremities.
1334440	1337400	And what's great about these two sites is you don't have to choose.
1337400	1341280	What's less expensive than signing up for either of them is signing up for their bundle
1341280	1346760	deal, where, if you head to curiositystream.com slash wendover, you'll not only get a 26%
1346760	1350920	discount on an annual plan, they'll also throw the Nebula subscription in for free,
1350920	1353640	for as long as you're a CuriosityStream subscriber.
1353640	1358840	That means you'll get both streaming sites for just $14.79 a year, and you'll be supporting
1358840	1363760	Wendover and loads of other independent creators, so head over to curiositystream.com slash
1363760	1365560	wendover to sign up today.
