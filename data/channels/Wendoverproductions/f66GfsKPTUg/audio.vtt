00:00.000 --> 00:05.240
Sitting in the center of a maze of dirt roads, shantytowns, crumbling infrastructure, open

00:05.240 --> 00:12.700
sewers, and trash fires, central Rwanda, circa 2015, was defined by opulence.

00:12.700 --> 00:17.780
Three times a week, a specially configured 747 would speed 14 hours across the Atlantic

00:17.780 --> 00:24.060
from Houston, depositing up to 189 passengers at Angola's International Airport—an unusually

00:24.060 --> 00:28.380
low number for this aircraft, reflecting its unusually luxurious interior.

00:28.380 --> 00:33.700
It spent first-class seats, 143 business, and just 36 in economy.

00:33.700 --> 00:38.460
The Houston Express, as it was dubbed, operated as a charter accessible only to invitees of

00:38.460 --> 00:42.560
Angola's national oil company, the Sonangol Group, and for the convenience of a non-stop

00:42.560 --> 00:50.220
flight to or from America's oil capital, they charged an eye-popping $2,399 for a round-trip

00:50.220 --> 00:55.260
economy-class ticket—roughly equivalent to half a year of income for the average Angolan.

00:55.700 --> 00:58.540
But these passengers were rarely Angolan.

00:58.540 --> 01:04.540
Rather, American oil executives, businesspeople, and their families filled the 189 seats, returning

01:04.540 --> 01:07.900
from a visit to their home offices or hometowns.

01:07.900 --> 01:12.220
Having cleared customs, most would instruct their taxis to turn left, or south, towards

01:12.220 --> 01:16.340
their gated community of choice in the polished Talatona neighborhood.

01:16.340 --> 01:21.020
Inside these walls, snaking streets dotted by Range Rovers, BMWs, and Porsches opened

01:21.020 --> 01:26.620
up to suburban-style housing, featuring manicured lawns, backyard pools, tennis courts, backup

01:26.620 --> 01:32.060
generators, water treatment systems, and 24-7 security—an approximate impression of average

01:32.060 --> 01:38.000
American housing, offered for a far higher than average $10,000 or $20,000 American dollars

01:38.000 --> 01:39.220
a month.

01:39.220 --> 01:44.340
Come evening, Talatona's residents might head to dinner at Cafe Del Mar, PIMS, UNDA,

01:44.340 --> 01:48.900
or even the city's yacht club—a walled enclave of luxury carved out of a landscape

01:48.900 --> 01:50.780
of tin-roofed shacks.

01:50.780 --> 01:55.920
Regardless of the restaurant of choice, one couldn't escape for less than $100 a head.

01:55.920 --> 02:01.060
On a budget-conscious night, one could head to KFC, but still, a meal there went for some

02:01.060 --> 02:03.180
$20 a person.

02:03.180 --> 02:07.620
Home cooking was also an option, but the comforts of home would cost you—a liter of Coke went

02:07.620 --> 02:11.700
for $10, while a pint of Häggendoss $17.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.540
While the adults of Talatona would typically commute into downtown Luanda to work in some

02:15.540 --> 02:19.600
the most expensive office space in the world, their kids would typically stay closer to

02:19.600 --> 02:22.660
home to attend the Luanda International School.

02:22.660 --> 02:26.980
English-language, American-accredited, international baccalaureate curriculum was taught by an

02:26.980 --> 02:32.180
international collection of teachers in a sprawling, modern, polished campus.

02:32.180 --> 02:38.460
Tuition averaged some $50,000 a year, equivalent to 11 Angolans' average annual income, but

02:38.460 --> 02:42.260
it was often paid by the pupils' parents' employers, as it was the only school in the

02:42.260 --> 02:46.560
city to regularly send graduates to Stanford, Columbia, and Oxford.

02:46.560 --> 02:53.100
The wealth of the Luanda elite was, simply put, extraordinary—and so too were the means

02:53.100 --> 02:55.700
by which Luanda got to this point.

02:55.700 --> 03:00.980
Until recently, Luanda was less a destination for the world's elite, and more so a destination

03:00.980 --> 03:04.060
for deadly military ordnance.

03:04.060 --> 03:08.460
Entering the 1970s, even at the height of decolonization, it would have been hard to

03:08.460 --> 03:12.940
imagine Luanda as the capital of a single, sovereign Angola.

03:12.940 --> 03:17.020
Entering this century, Luanda would have seemed one of the least likely of African capitals

03:17.020 --> 03:21.780
to have its downtown dotted with high-end hotels and streets crisscrossed by BMWs and

03:21.780 --> 03:22.900
Porsches.

03:22.900 --> 03:28.540
The bloody, drawn-out process of Angolan independence began in earnest here.

03:28.540 --> 03:34.420
On January 4, 1961, where a protest over farm wages devolved into violence that spread across

03:34.420 --> 03:39.600
northern Angola, before a brutal Portuguese response stopped the rebellion in its tracks.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.340
The months-long revolt signaled the upswelling of a nascent Angolan nationalism, while its

03:44.340 --> 03:49.680
violent conclusion hinted at the uphill battle such a movement would face going forward.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.760
In the years that followed this first rural revolt, a series of independence movements

03:53.760 --> 03:56.080
took shape across Angola.

03:56.080 --> 04:00.900
The FNLA, the main combatant group in 1961, formed in the north and coalesced around a

04:00.900 --> 04:03.220
shared Bakongo ethnicity.

04:03.220 --> 04:09.020
From Luanda came the MPLA, a Marxist-Leninist group made up largely of Angolan intelligentsia,

04:09.020 --> 04:13.880
and in central Angola was UNITA, a group of FNLA dissidents who rallied around their Uvumbundu

04:13.880 --> 04:15.020
ethnic background.

04:15.020 --> 04:21.200
For the next decade, each group took on Portuguese military and Portuguese-funded paramilitaries.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.180
Because of such stark ideological and ethnic divides, though, each group did so individually,

04:26.180 --> 04:28.740
and each, in turn, failed.

04:28.740 --> 04:33.860
By 1974, Portuguese forces had pushed each of these factions to the very brink.

04:33.860 --> 04:39.680
Then, unexpectedly, Portugal itself fell in a military coup, and with the old regime went

04:39.680 --> 04:43.120
any interest in maintaining the nation's African colonies.

04:43.120 --> 04:49.000
After 400 years, Angola's colonial period was suddenly coming to a close.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.420
The ethnic and ideological divides that had fragmented their independence movement, however,

04:53.420 --> 04:55.340
weren't going anywhere.

04:56.100 --> 05:00.660
Forty years before it was known for the luxurious oil-funded Houston Express service, Luanda's

05:00.660 --> 05:04.660
airport appeared in the media as a chaotic, miserably crowded departure point for some

05:04.660 --> 05:09.020
200,000 Portuguese-Angolans fleeing from an impending war.

05:09.020 --> 05:12.900
Just months later, on the eve of Angola's official independence, the decision to leave

05:12.900 --> 05:18.300
proved prudent as the MPLA rushed the capital, pushed the FNLA out of Luanda, and named the

05:18.300 --> 05:21.760
nation's new president, Agostino Neto.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.980
It was the first major move of what would be a decades-long civil war.

05:26.980 --> 05:31.140
From the start, the war took on an international bent, as thousands of Cuban soldiers and two

05:31.140 --> 05:36.040
Yugoslavian warships bolstered the Marxist-Leninist hold over the capital, while South Africa,

05:36.040 --> 05:41.680
Zaire, and, through covert funding, the US, all backed the now-allied FNLA and UNITA.

05:41.680 --> 05:46.560
A hotspot in the Cold War, Angolan territory flipped between UNITA and MPLA forces practically

05:46.560 --> 05:51.160
every battle, every offensive, and every year, as aid from various world powers bolstered

05:51.200 --> 05:54.020
both parties' ability to keep fighting.

05:54.020 --> 05:58.200
Between the occasional ceasefire or failed negotiation, the war carried through the 70s

05:58.200 --> 05:59.200
and 80s.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.800
Without either side able to claim a defensive victory, it stretched into the 90s.

06:03.800 --> 06:08.520
As the Cold War closed, Angola's civil war lost its ideological edge and international

06:08.520 --> 06:09.520
appeal.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.000
Angola's president, José Eduardo dos Santos, who had led the MPLA government since Neto's

06:14.000 --> 06:19.000
death in 1979, liberalized much of the Angolan economy, while UNITA carried on without the

06:19.000 --> 06:23.160
money from the West, instead funding their war efforts through the diamond trade.

06:23.160 --> 06:27.560
In 2002, with the assassination of its longtime leader, with increasingly tight sanctions

06:27.560 --> 06:33.400
on its diamond trade, and without a real cause to fight for, UNITA entered peace talks.

06:33.400 --> 06:39.320
After nearly 30 years, the Angolan civil war came sputtering to a close, accomplishing

06:39.320 --> 06:41.280
remarkably little.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.360
The same party remained in power, the same president remained in office, while a third

06:45.360 --> 06:49.000
of the nation's population had now been internally displaced, two-thirds didn't

06:49.000 --> 06:53.500
have access to running water, and life expectancy hovered in the 40s.

06:53.500 --> 06:58.440
Late to gain its independence, and mired by three decades of ruthless civil war, 21st

06:58.440 --> 07:01.680
century Angola was desperately behind.

07:01.680 --> 07:07.340
Now, for as long as Angola's been a country, it's been an oil economy.

07:07.340 --> 07:11.720
In fact, by the time the civil war ended, Angola was nearing its 100th anniversary of

07:11.720 --> 07:13.660
commercial oil production.

07:13.660 --> 07:17.580
Even during the war, as landmines littered the countryside and deadly violence occurred

07:17.580 --> 07:22.060
daily, international oil giants like Shell and Chevron braved the conditions on account

07:22.060 --> 07:25.100
of the profit opportunity Angola afforded.

07:25.100 --> 07:29.140
Onshore oil fields were frequently attacked and destroyed, but much of the country's

07:29.140 --> 07:33.860
oil was located offshore, beneath hundreds or thousands of feet of ocean.

07:33.860 --> 07:38.520
So, focus gravitated offshore, where the liquid gold could be extracted in relative safety

07:38.520 --> 07:40.140
throughout the conflict.

07:40.140 --> 07:44.900
Ironically, however, the oil industry itself prolonged their biggest obstacle to increase

07:44.900 --> 07:49.060
production as they funded the MPLA's war machine through the drilling fees they paid

07:49.060 --> 07:50.060
them.

07:50.060 --> 07:55.660
But, when the war finally ended, when peace was found, that obstacle was removed.

07:55.660 --> 07:59.660
Without the civil war necessitating burdensome security contractors and expensive hardship

07:59.660 --> 08:06.040
wages, oil production in Angola immediately grew far cheaper and far easier.

08:06.040 --> 08:09.060
Profiteers the world over jumped on the opportunity.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.140
So, Angola and its international partners planned for new rigs and expanded operations,

08:13.140 --> 08:17.420
which came at the perfect time as the West, and especially America, looked to distance

08:17.420 --> 08:21.000
itself from Middle Eastern oil in the wake of 9-11.

08:21.000 --> 08:25.700
President dos Santos was even invited by Bush to the Oval Office to discuss that very subject.

08:25.700 --> 08:30.580
Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, China also identified the opportunity.

08:30.580 --> 08:34.980
Just months after the war officially ended, it signed a $2 billion loan agreement with

08:34.980 --> 08:38.540
Angola, using its future oil production as collateral.

08:38.580 --> 08:42.940
It put the country in a strategic tug-of-war between two of the world's great powers.

08:42.940 --> 08:47.340
Within three short years, the post-war economy was kicking into high gear.

08:47.340 --> 08:51.540
2005's oil production figures were already double those of the civil war era, and the

08:51.540 --> 08:58.940
country recorded its highest GDP jump in history—the economy expanded some 15% in just 12 months.

08:58.940 --> 09:03.580
Soon after, Angola overtook Saudi Arabia to become China's largest oil provider, while

09:03.580 --> 09:07.340
the country's first shopping mall opened in the center of the quickly-developing, upscale

09:07.340 --> 09:08.740
Talatona neighborhood.

09:08.740 --> 09:14.020
Angola's position as a new oil giant was solidified as it joined the organization of

09:14.020 --> 09:18.820
the petroleum-exporting countries—a global price-fixing cartel including Iraq, Saudi

09:18.820 --> 09:21.460
Arabia, the UAE, and others.

09:21.460 --> 09:25.740
By the 2010s, La Wanda Skyline had been thoroughly transformed.

09:25.740 --> 09:29.700
Glass-fronted skyscrapers stretched hundreds of feet into the sky, filled with modern apartments

09:29.700 --> 09:33.300
selling for millions or tens of millions of dollars.

09:33.300 --> 09:37.700
Five-star hotels now offered visiting executives accommodations on par with those in Houston,

09:37.700 --> 09:41.600
Calgary, Abu Dhabi, or the other oil capitals of the world.

09:41.600 --> 09:46.020
Even the global financial crisis barely shook La Wanda from its path, as the global economy

09:46.020 --> 09:48.660
shrank, and Angola still eked out growth.

09:48.660 --> 09:55.440
It was one of the fastest-growing, fastest-developing, fastest-changing countries in the world.

09:55.440 --> 10:01.300
Others had experienced oil booms, but none went from civil war to helipad-laden $10 million

10:01.300 --> 10:04.580
in penthouse apartments in less than a decade.

10:04.580 --> 10:09.080
Some asked if La Wanda was on track to become the Dubai of Africa—a place that, just a

10:09.080 --> 10:13.580
few more years into the future, would have Lamborghinis on every block, five-star hotels

10:13.580 --> 10:18.980
from every international brand, and Michelin-starred restaurants from all the globe's best chefs.

10:18.980 --> 10:23.260
Others, however, started asking a different question.

10:23.260 --> 10:26.420
What had this boom done for everyone else?

10:26.420 --> 10:31.820
Among the expats and oil executives and politicians and businesspeople, how had life changed for

10:31.820 --> 10:37.180
the everyday Angolan—the other 99.5% of the country?

10:37.180 --> 10:46.460
Well, between 2002 and 2010, Angola's economy grew 534%, but, of course, GDP is not a useful

10:46.460 --> 10:50.020
metric for assessing the quality of life of the everyday person.

10:50.020 --> 10:54.900
What is is the Human Development Index, which combines metrics related to health, education,

10:54.900 --> 10:57.620
and standard of living into a composite score?

10:57.620 --> 11:01.140
Angola's in 2002 was 0.426 out of 1.

11:01.140 --> 11:04.180
By 2010, it was 0.517.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.820
It had jumped more than 20%.

11:06.820 --> 11:08.700
But so did the rest of the world's.

11:08.700 --> 11:14.500
Looking relatively, Angola ranked 154th in the world for HDI in 2002.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.100
In 2010, it ranked higher—by four places.

11:18.100 --> 11:24.860
That's to say, the economy was now $66 billion larger, but somehow, the everyday Angolan

11:24.860 --> 11:28.540
was doing just about the same.

11:28.540 --> 11:33.100
This was baffling, and an embarrassment for the country's triumphant leadership.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.580
When the United Nations Development Program released data indicating that just 19% of

11:37.580 --> 11:42.020
men and 15% of women in the country attained a high school-level education, the government

11:42.020 --> 11:45.700
disputed the figures, saying the UN had an incorrect methodology.

11:45.700 --> 11:50.660
But the embarrassments kept stacking—the facade started to fall.

11:50.700 --> 11:55.840
2010 was supposed to be a watershed year for Angola as it hosted the Africa Cup of Nations,

11:55.840 --> 11:58.720
the third largest soccer tournament in existence.

11:58.720 --> 12:04.240
It was supposed to be the clearest indication yet that Angola was safe, developed, and open

12:04.240 --> 12:08.400
to the world, but in the days leading up to its start, as Togo's national team traveled

12:08.400 --> 12:13.140
to their opening match, separatists gunned down their bus as it passed through Cabinda,

12:13.140 --> 12:16.020
killing three of their traveling party.

12:16.020 --> 12:20.620
This incident cast a dark shadow on the typically jubilant tournament, and was positioned in

12:20.620 --> 12:24.920
international media as an indicator that, despite all the pomp and circumstance of the

12:24.920 --> 12:31.380
new Rwanda, deep down, Angola was still the same underdeveloped, impoverished, violent

12:31.380 --> 12:34.260
country of a decade before.

12:34.260 --> 12:39.260
For a decade, the success stories drowned out failures, but failures began to mount,

12:39.260 --> 12:42.180
and as they did, they became harder to ignore.

12:42.180 --> 12:46.420
2012 brought coverage of what was believed to be the most expensive apartment sale on

12:46.420 --> 12:49.140
the African continent to date in Rwanda.

12:49.140 --> 12:52.680
But acknowledging the difficulty the real estate boom presented to housing everyone

12:52.680 --> 12:57.780
else, Dos Santos had promised in his 2008 presidential campaign to build a million homes

12:57.780 --> 12:59.540
by 2012.

12:59.540 --> 13:04.940
In 2012, however, even the pared-down post-election version of this promise faltered.

13:04.940 --> 13:08.820
The first 2,800 apartments went up for sale in the brand-new Kalama neighborhood, which

13:08.820 --> 13:12.900
would eventually have capacity for 200,000 working-class residents.

13:12.900 --> 13:17.900
At six months in, just 220 of those homes had been sold, due to the fact that the very

13:17.900 --> 13:21.860
working-class residents they were built for couldn't afford or finance them.

13:21.860 --> 13:27.300
But the next year, Angola was celebrated the world over, as Isabel Dos Santos, the president's

13:27.300 --> 13:32.380
daughter, had become the first African woman ever to make the Forbes billionaires list,

13:32.380 --> 13:36.580
with an estimated net worth north of $3 billion.

13:36.580 --> 13:40.840
It wasn't South Africa, or Nigeria, or any of the continent's other traditional centers

13:40.840 --> 13:45.720
of wealth to earn this honor, but rather tiny, scrappy Angola.

13:45.720 --> 13:50.300
Dos Santos owned significant stakes in banks, media companies, and sale providers in Angola

13:50.300 --> 13:54.840
and Portugal—a home on the private island of the exclusive Bulgari Resort in Dubai,

13:54.840 --> 13:59.920
a $16 million home in the affluent Kensington neighborhood of London, a comparatively modest

13:59.920 --> 14:05.360
$1.8 million penthouse apartment in Lisbon, a $55 million villa just steps away from the

14:05.360 --> 14:12.080
Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco, and to go with it, a $35 million, 50-meter, 164-foot

14:12.080 --> 14:14.400
yacht anchored in the Mediterranean below.

14:14.400 --> 14:20.400
And in 2016, her fortunes, both literal and figurative, only increased as her father fired

14:20.400 --> 14:27.120
the entire board of Sonigal, Angola's national oil company, and replaced it with a sole chairwoman—Isabel

14:27.120 --> 14:29.160
Dos Santos herself.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.200
She was now in charge of the most powerful company in the country, making her perhaps

14:33.200 --> 14:37.360
the country's second most powerful person after her father himself.

14:37.360 --> 14:42.720
However, just months earlier, he had announced his imminent retirement.

14:42.720 --> 14:47.680
Jose Eduardo Dos Santos would pass the torch, and Angola would have a new president—for

14:47.680 --> 14:51.020
the first time in 38 years.

14:51.020 --> 14:55.480
The president and his party planned for longtime MKLA politician João Lorenzo to take the

14:55.480 --> 14:59.400
reins, which he did on September 26, 2017.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.280
But then things went less to plan.

15:02.280 --> 15:06.420
Isabel Dos Santos was quickly fired from her leading position at Sonigal, while her

15:06.420 --> 15:10.760
half-brother, who had been leading the country's sovereign wealth fund, was arrested on corruption

15:10.760 --> 15:13.200
and money laundering charges.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.200
Out of nowhere, João Lorenzo turned on the Dos Santos family, and asked the question

15:18.200 --> 15:23.960
no powerful MPLA leader had ever dared—was it merely a coincidence that Africa's wealthiest

15:23.960 --> 15:29.040
woman was the daughter of Angola's most powerful man, or was something more nefarious

15:29.040 --> 15:30.360
going on?

15:30.360 --> 15:34.340
Quietly, this question had been circling around the international business community

15:34.340 --> 15:40.080
for years, and by the mid-2010s, some were formulating informed opinions.

15:40.080 --> 15:43.880
Western banks like Citigroup and Berkeley backed out of deals with the businesswoman,

15:43.880 --> 15:48.320
InterTrust and ING closed accounts linked to her and her husband, and Sonigal officials

15:48.320 --> 15:52.600
rallied against Dos Santos' alleged mismanagement of funds.

15:52.600 --> 15:57.720
For her part, Dos Santos pushed back, arguing that claims of illegality were unfounded and

15:57.720 --> 16:00.360
that the banks had anti-African biases.

16:00.360 --> 16:07.040
Then, in 2020, as rumors swirled, accusations mounted, and investigations dug deeper, the

16:07.040 --> 16:11.300
world was offered its clearest view yet into Dos Santos' business dealings through a

16:11.300 --> 16:15.840
landslide of private documents called the Luanda Leaks.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.800
Captured by a notorious Portuguese whistleblower, passed through the Paris-based platform to

16:19.800 --> 16:24.360
protect whistleblowers in Africa, then analyzed and disseminated by the International Consortium

16:24.360 --> 16:29.840
of Investigative Journalists, the 715,000 leaked memos, emails, contracts, and meeting

16:29.840 --> 16:34.600
minutes corroborated many of the suspicions and outright accusations lobbed at the former

16:34.600 --> 16:36.400
president's daughter.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.840
At practically every turn in her empire-building career, the documents showed, Isabel Dos Santos

16:40.840 --> 16:45.860
benefited from insider dealmaking that landed her one massive government contract after

16:45.860 --> 16:47.280
the next.

16:47.280 --> 16:52.800
In 1999, there was the brand new mobile phone company Unitel, of which she owned a 25% share,

16:52.800 --> 16:56.300
being granted a valuable telecoms license by the government.

16:56.300 --> 17:01.000
In 2015, there was the Isabel Dos Santos-led urban redevelopment project being greenlit

17:01.000 --> 17:07.360
by presidential decree that, the leaked documents later showed, was drafted by her own lawyers.

17:07.360 --> 17:12.680
At every opportunity, major government undertakings seemingly designed to help everyday Angolans

17:12.680 --> 17:16.560
were being routed through various Isabel Dos Santos holdings.

17:16.560 --> 17:20.680
Beyond the murky, uncompetitive doling out of government contracts, Dos Santos and her

17:20.680 --> 17:24.880
husband Sandika Dokolo further bolstered their own wealth through fraudulent deals

17:24.880 --> 17:30.920
and creative accounting which, in turn, further stunted the development of the Angolan economy.

17:30.920 --> 17:35.200
In addition to the $1 billion in dividends Dos Santos made, and the $1 billion stake

17:35.200 --> 17:39.780
she still owned in Unitel, now the nation's largest telecom provider, Dos Santos also

17:39.780 --> 17:44.400
went ahead and set up another company called Unitel International Holdings, which she lent

17:44.400 --> 17:51.000
upwards of $460 million from Unitel, signing off as both the lender and the borrower and

17:51.000 --> 17:54.300
leaving the Unitel board utterly dumbfounded.

17:54.300 --> 17:58.580
The money made from shady insider deals like this then went on to cycle through or open

17:58.580 --> 18:02.600
a vast array of shell companies in places like the British Virgin Islands and Malta,

18:02.600 --> 18:06.800
where tax burdens and government oversight would be low or nonexistent.

18:06.800 --> 18:10.680
This international expansion, leaks would prove, explained why companies like Malta's

18:10.680 --> 18:14.940
Wise Intelligent Solutions, with herself and her husband as sole shareholders and only

18:14.940 --> 18:19.180
a handful of staff with no expertise in oil, were being awarded contracts to restructure

18:19.180 --> 18:22.280
a floundering Senegal in 2015.

18:22.280 --> 18:26.640
All told, the ICIJ analysis of the Luanda leaks claimed that the Dos Santos and Dokolo

18:26.640 --> 18:31.560
empire was made up of more than 400 companies and subsidiaries, spanning 41 countries with

18:31.560 --> 18:36.040
at least 94 stashed in secrecy jurisdictions like Malta.

18:36.040 --> 18:41.120
Despite painstakingly poring over these 70,000 documents, journalists helped to substantiate

18:41.120 --> 18:45.680
what skeptical onlookers have been claiming since 2013—that the Dos Santos empire was

18:45.680 --> 18:48.040
hardly something to be celebrated.

18:48.040 --> 18:52.160
Rather than a signal that Angola was on the rise, Isabel Dos Santos' ill-gotten wealth

18:52.160 --> 18:56.660
was actually going a long way in keeping average Angolans down.

18:56.660 --> 19:02.080
In late 2020, President Lorenzo claimed that the government of José Eduardo Dos Santos

19:02.080 --> 19:08.400
had squandered away and outright stolen an estimated $24 billion of the Angolan government,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.200
and therefore the Angolan people's money.

19:11.200 --> 19:16.700
Angola's story is tragically unoriginal—an African country that strikes it rich with

19:16.700 --> 19:22.600
natural resources, but where poverty and pain persist for all but the powerful few.

19:22.600 --> 19:28.040
Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, Zambia—the same narrative plays out time

19:28.040 --> 19:33.480
and time again across the continent, crippling the people's futures.

19:33.480 --> 19:38.440
This natural wealth-economic poverty paradox is so common in development economics that

19:38.440 --> 19:42.800
it has a name, the resource curse, and while this continent propagates the phenomenon,

19:42.800 --> 19:45.120
it's observed globally.

19:45.120 --> 19:50.440
Simply, natural resources rarely propel people out of poverty.

19:50.440 --> 19:53.900
But today, there's the benefit of hindsight.

19:53.900 --> 19:59.740
Education and cronyism is now identifiably the evil holding the people back, so as dictators

19:59.740 --> 20:06.060
die out, democracies across Africa have the opportunity to try something new.

20:06.060 --> 20:11.420
On August 24th, 2022, Angolans will head to their polling places to decide whether Joao

20:11.420 --> 20:17.180
Lorenzo and his MPLA party will earn a second term, or if UNITA, for the first time ever,

20:17.180 --> 20:19.980
will take control of the country.

20:20.060 --> 20:24.740
Arrigingly, both parties' campaigns are centered around defeating corruption.

20:24.740 --> 20:29.020
While one candidate points to his past action investigating and punishing his predecessors,

20:29.020 --> 20:32.820
the other says he didn't go far enough, and is charting out a path for more systematic

20:32.820 --> 20:34.020
reform.

20:34.020 --> 20:38.900
Angola has a long way to go, and starting from behind, but the oil's still there,

20:38.900 --> 20:43.100
it's still producing millions of barrels per day, and billions are still left in the

20:43.100 --> 20:44.100
ground.

20:44.100 --> 20:47.860
If the people can accurately predict which candidate will stick to their word, which

20:47.860 --> 20:52.100
candidate will find a path to turn natural wealth into human wealth, then all is not

20:52.100 --> 20:59.020
lost for Angola—it still has a chance of breaking the resource curse.

20:59.020 --> 21:02.580
If you're anything like me, you probably spend an embarrassing amount of time scrolling

21:02.580 --> 21:05.380
through streaming sites trying to find something good to watch.

21:05.380 --> 21:09.300
Well, to stop you from doing that tonight, I have a seminal list of a whole evening's

21:09.300 --> 21:12.820
worth of entertainment that any Wendover viewer is sure to enjoy.

21:12.820 --> 21:16.660
To start out with, there's the first episode of our new season of Extremities, which does

21:16.660 --> 21:21.380
a deep dive into why the US holds onto the tiny, mid-Pacific territory of Wake Island

21:21.380 --> 21:24.540
through first-hand interviews with those who have lived and worked there.

21:24.540 --> 21:28.260
A small hint—it has a whole lot to do with airplanes.

21:28.260 --> 21:31.860
Next you should give the latest episode of PolyMatter's series China Axia Watch, where

21:31.860 --> 21:36.540
he explains how the country manages to survive and thrive with essentially zero major international

21:36.540 --> 21:37.540
allies.

21:37.540 --> 21:41.560
Finally, you should watch Half as Interesting's Crime Spree, the pilot season of our travel

21:41.560 --> 21:45.560
competition show Jet Lag, where my writers chase me across the country as I attempt to

21:45.560 --> 21:47.740
complete challenges as I go.

21:47.740 --> 21:53.040
Each of these, and so much more, is exclusive to either Nebula or CuriosityStream, two fantastic

21:53.040 --> 21:54.340
streaming sites.

21:54.340 --> 21:57.840
The first was founded by myself and a bunch of other educational creators to be the best

21:57.840 --> 22:01.500
home to the stuff we make, allowing us to make higher-budget, more controversial, more

22:01.500 --> 22:05.280
unique or other sorts of videos that just don't work on YouTube.

22:05.280 --> 22:08.920
Meanwhile, CuriosityStream was founded by the same people as Discovery Channel, and

22:08.920 --> 22:13.440
hosts all sorts of fantastic STEM-oriented documentaries and shows, including our series

22:13.440 --> 22:14.440
Extremities.

22:14.440 --> 22:17.400
And what's great about these two sites is you don't have to choose.

22:17.400 --> 22:21.280
What's less expensive than signing up for either of them is signing up for their bundle

22:21.280 --> 22:26.760
deal, where, if you head to curiositystream.com slash wendover, you'll not only get a 26%

22:26.760 --> 22:30.920
discount on an annual plan, they'll also throw the Nebula subscription in for free,

22:30.920 --> 22:33.640
for as long as you're a CuriosityStream subscriber.

22:33.640 --> 22:38.840
That means you'll get both streaming sites for just $14.79 a year, and you'll be supporting

22:38.840 --> 22:43.760
Wendover and loads of other independent creators, so head over to curiositystream.com slash

22:43.760 --> 22:45.560
wendover to sign up today.
