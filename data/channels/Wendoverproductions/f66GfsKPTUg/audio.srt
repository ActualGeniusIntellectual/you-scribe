1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Sitting in the center of a maze of dirt roads, shantytowns, crumbling infrastructure, open

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:12,700
sewers, and trash fires, central Rwanda, circa 2015, was defined by opulence.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,780
Three times a week, a specially configured 747 would speed 14 hours across the Atlantic

4
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:24,060
from Houston, depositing up to 189 passengers at Angola's International Airport—an unusually

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,380
low number for this aircraft, reflecting its unusually luxurious interior.

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,700
It spent first-class seats, 143 business, and just 36 in economy.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,460
The Houston Express, as it was dubbed, operated as a charter accessible only to invitees of

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,560
Angola's national oil company, the Sonangol Group, and for the convenience of a non-stop

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:50,220
flight to or from America's oil capital, they charged an eye-popping $2,399 for a round-trip

10
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,260
economy-class ticket—roughly equivalent to half a year of income for the average Angolan.

11
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,540
But these passengers were rarely Angolan.

12
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:04,540
Rather, American oil executives, businesspeople, and their families filled the 189 seats, returning

13
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,900
from a visit to their home offices or hometowns.

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,220
Having cleared customs, most would instruct their taxis to turn left, or south, towards

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,340
their gated community of choice in the polished Talatona neighborhood.

16
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,020
Inside these walls, snaking streets dotted by Range Rovers, BMWs, and Porsches opened

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,620
up to suburban-style housing, featuring manicured lawns, backyard pools, tennis courts, backup

18
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,060
generators, water treatment systems, and 24-7 security—an approximate impression of average

19
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,000
American housing, offered for a far higher than average $10,000 or $20,000 American dollars

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,220
a month.

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,340
Come evening, Talatona's residents might head to dinner at Cafe Del Mar, PIMS, UNDA,

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,900
or even the city's yacht club—a walled enclave of luxury carved out of a landscape

23
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,780
of tin-roofed shacks.

24
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:55,920
Regardless of the restaurant of choice, one couldn't escape for less than $100 a head.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,060
On a budget-conscious night, one could head to KFC, but still, a meal there went for some

26
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,180
$20 a person.

27
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,620
Home cooking was also an option, but the comforts of home would cost you—a liter of Coke went

28
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,700
for $10, while a pint of Häggendoss $17.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,540
While the adults of Talatona would typically commute into downtown Luanda to work in some

30
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,600
the most expensive office space in the world, their kids would typically stay closer to

31
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,660
home to attend the Luanda International School.

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,980
English-language, American-accredited, international baccalaureate curriculum was taught by an

33
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,180
international collection of teachers in a sprawling, modern, polished campus.

34
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,460
Tuition averaged some $50,000 a year, equivalent to 11 Angolans' average annual income, but

35
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,260
it was often paid by the pupils' parents' employers, as it was the only school in the

36
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,560
city to regularly send graduates to Stanford, Columbia, and Oxford.

37
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:53,100
The wealth of the Luanda elite was, simply put, extraordinary—and so too were the means

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,700
by which Luanda got to this point.

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,980
Until recently, Luanda was less a destination for the world's elite, and more so a destination

40
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,060
for deadly military ordnance.

41
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,460
Entering the 1970s, even at the height of decolonization, it would have been hard to

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,940
imagine Luanda as the capital of a single, sovereign Angola.

43
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,020
Entering this century, Luanda would have seemed one of the least likely of African capitals

44
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,780
to have its downtown dotted with high-end hotels and streets crisscrossed by BMWs and

45
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,900
Porsches.

46
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,540
The bloody, drawn-out process of Angolan independence began in earnest here.

47
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,420
On January 4, 1961, where a protest over farm wages devolved into violence that spread across

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:39,600
northern Angola, before a brutal Portuguese response stopped the rebellion in its tracks.

49
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,340
The months-long revolt signaled the upswelling of a nascent Angolan nationalism, while its

50
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,680
violent conclusion hinted at the uphill battle such a movement would face going forward.

51
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,760
In the years that followed this first rural revolt, a series of independence movements

52
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,080
took shape across Angola.

53
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,900
The FNLA, the main combatant group in 1961, formed in the north and coalesced around a

54
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,220
shared Bakongo ethnicity.

55
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:09,020
From Luanda came the MPLA, a Marxist-Leninist group made up largely of Angolan intelligentsia,

56
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,880
and in central Angola was UNITA, a group of FNLA dissidents who rallied around their Uvumbundu

57
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,020
ethnic background.

58
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:21,200
For the next decade, each group took on Portuguese military and Portuguese-funded paramilitaries.

59
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,180
Because of such stark ideological and ethnic divides, though, each group did so individually,

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,740
and each, in turn, failed.

61
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,860
By 1974, Portuguese forces had pushed each of these factions to the very brink.

62
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,680
Then, unexpectedly, Portugal itself fell in a military coup, and with the old regime went

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
any interest in maintaining the nation's African colonies.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,000
After 400 years, Angola's colonial period was suddenly coming to a close.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,420
The ethnic and ideological divides that had fragmented their independence movement, however,

66
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,340
weren't going anywhere.

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,660
Forty years before it was known for the luxurious oil-funded Houston Express service, Luanda's

68
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,660
airport appeared in the media as a chaotic, miserably crowded departure point for some

69
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,020
200,000 Portuguese-Angolans fleeing from an impending war.

70
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,900
Just months later, on the eve of Angola's official independence, the decision to leave

71
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:18,300
proved prudent as the MPLA rushed the capital, pushed the FNLA out of Luanda, and named the

72
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,760
nation's new president, Agostino Neto.

73
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,980
It was the first major move of what would be a decades-long civil war.

74
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:31,140
From the start, the war took on an international bent, as thousands of Cuban soldiers and two

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,040
Yugoslavian warships bolstered the Marxist-Leninist hold over the capital, while South Africa,

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,680
Zaire, and, through covert funding, the US, all backed the now-allied FNLA and UNITA.

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,560
A hotspot in the Cold War, Angolan territory flipped between UNITA and MPLA forces practically

78
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,160
every battle, every offensive, and every year, as aid from various world powers bolstered

79
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,020
both parties' ability to keep fighting.

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,200
Between the occasional ceasefire or failed negotiation, the war carried through the 70s

81
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
and 80s.

82
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,800
Without either side able to claim a defensive victory, it stretched into the 90s.

83
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,520
As the Cold War closed, Angola's civil war lost its ideological edge and international

84
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,520
appeal.

85
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
Angola's president, José Eduardo dos Santos, who had led the MPLA government since Neto's

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
death in 1979, liberalized much of the Angolan economy, while UNITA carried on without the

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,160
money from the West, instead funding their war efforts through the diamond trade.

88
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,560
In 2002, with the assassination of its longtime leader, with increasingly tight sanctions

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,400
on its diamond trade, and without a real cause to fight for, UNITA entered peace talks.

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,320
After nearly 30 years, the Angolan civil war came sputtering to a close, accomplishing

91
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,280
remarkably little.

92
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,360
The same party remained in power, the same president remained in office, while a third

93
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,000
of the nation's population had now been internally displaced, two-thirds didn't

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,500
have access to running water, and life expectancy hovered in the 40s.

95
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,440
Late to gain its independence, and mired by three decades of ruthless civil war, 21st

96
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,680
century Angola was desperately behind.

97
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,340
Now, for as long as Angola's been a country, it's been an oil economy.

98
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:11,720
In fact, by the time the civil war ended, Angola was nearing its 100th anniversary of

99
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,660
commercial oil production.

100
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,580
Even during the war, as landmines littered the countryside and deadly violence occurred

101
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,060
daily, international oil giants like Shell and Chevron braved the conditions on account

102
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,100
of the profit opportunity Angola afforded.

103
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:29,140
Onshore oil fields were frequently attacked and destroyed, but much of the country's

104
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,860
oil was located offshore, beneath hundreds or thousands of feet of ocean.

105
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,520
So, focus gravitated offshore, where the liquid gold could be extracted in relative safety

106
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,140
throughout the conflict.

107
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,900
Ironically, however, the oil industry itself prolonged their biggest obstacle to increase

108
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:49,060
production as they funded the MPLA's war machine through the drilling fees they paid

109
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
them.

110
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,660
But, when the war finally ended, when peace was found, that obstacle was removed.

111
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Without the civil war necessitating burdensome security contractors and expensive hardship

112
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,040
wages, oil production in Angola immediately grew far cheaper and far easier.

113
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,060
Profiteers the world over jumped on the opportunity.

114
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,140
So, Angola and its international partners planned for new rigs and expanded operations,

115
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:17,420
which came at the perfect time as the West, and especially America, looked to distance

116
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,000
itself from Middle Eastern oil in the wake of 9-11.

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,700
President dos Santos was even invited by Bush to the Oval Office to discuss that very subject.

118
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,580
Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, China also identified the opportunity.

119
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,980
Just months after the war officially ended, it signed a $2 billion loan agreement with

120
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,540
Angola, using its future oil production as collateral.

121
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,940
It put the country in a strategic tug-of-war between two of the world's great powers.

122
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:47,340
Within three short years, the post-war economy was kicking into high gear.

123
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,540
2005's oil production figures were already double those of the civil war era, and the

124
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,940
country recorded its highest GDP jump in history—the economy expanded some 15% in just 12 months.

125
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,580
Soon after, Angola overtook Saudi Arabia to become China's largest oil provider, while

126
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,340
the country's first shopping mall opened in the center of the quickly-developing, upscale

127
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,740
Talatona neighborhood.

128
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,020
Angola's position as a new oil giant was solidified as it joined the organization of

129
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,820
the petroleum-exporting countries—a global price-fixing cartel including Iraq, Saudi

130
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,460
Arabia, the UAE, and others.

131
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,740
By the 2010s, La Wanda Skyline had been thoroughly transformed.

132
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,700
Glass-fronted skyscrapers stretched hundreds of feet into the sky, filled with modern apartments

133
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,300
selling for millions or tens of millions of dollars.

134
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,700
Five-star hotels now offered visiting executives accommodations on par with those in Houston,

135
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,600
Calgary, Abu Dhabi, or the other oil capitals of the world.

136
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,020
Even the global financial crisis barely shook La Wanda from its path, as the global economy

137
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,660
shrank, and Angola still eked out growth.

138
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:55,440
It was one of the fastest-growing, fastest-developing, fastest-changing countries in the world.

139
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,300
Others had experienced oil booms, but none went from civil war to helipad-laden $10 million

140
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,580
in penthouse apartments in less than a decade.

141
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,080
Some asked if La Wanda was on track to become the Dubai of Africa—a place that, just a

142
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,580
few more years into the future, would have Lamborghinis on every block, five-star hotels

143
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,980
from every international brand, and Michelin-starred restaurants from all the globe's best chefs.

144
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,260
Others, however, started asking a different question.

145
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,420
What had this boom done for everyone else?

146
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,820
Among the expats and oil executives and politicians and businesspeople, how had life changed for

147
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,180
the everyday Angolan—the other 99.5% of the country?

148
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:46,460
Well, between 2002 and 2010, Angola's economy grew 534%, but, of course, GDP is not a useful

149
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,020
metric for assessing the quality of life of the everyday person.

150
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,900
What is is the Human Development Index, which combines metrics related to health, education,

151
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,620
and standard of living into a composite score?

152
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,140
Angola's in 2002 was 0.426 out of 1.

153
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,180
By 2010, it was 0.517.

154
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,820
It had jumped more than 20%.

155
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,700
But so did the rest of the world's.

156
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Looking relatively, Angola ranked 154th in the world for HDI in 2002.

157
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,100
In 2010, it ranked higher—by four places.

158
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,860
That's to say, the economy was now $66 billion larger, but somehow, the everyday Angolan

159
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,540
was doing just about the same.

160
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,100
This was baffling, and an embarrassment for the country's triumphant leadership.

161
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,580
When the United Nations Development Program released data indicating that just 19% of

162
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:42,020
men and 15% of women in the country attained a high school-level education, the government

163
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,700
disputed the figures, saying the UN had an incorrect methodology.

164
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,660
But the embarrassments kept stacking—the facade started to fall.

165
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,840
2010 was supposed to be a watershed year for Angola as it hosted the Africa Cup of Nations,

166
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,720
the third largest soccer tournament in existence.

167
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,240
It was supposed to be the clearest indication yet that Angola was safe, developed, and open

168
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,400
to the world, but in the days leading up to its start, as Togo's national team traveled

169
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:13,140
to their opening match, separatists gunned down their bus as it passed through Cabinda,

170
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,020
killing three of their traveling party.

171
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:20,620
This incident cast a dark shadow on the typically jubilant tournament, and was positioned in

172
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,920
international media as an indicator that, despite all the pomp and circumstance of the

173
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:31,380
new Rwanda, deep down, Angola was still the same underdeveloped, impoverished, violent

174
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,260
country of a decade before.

175
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,260
For a decade, the success stories drowned out failures, but failures began to mount,

176
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,180
and as they did, they became harder to ignore.

177
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,420
2012 brought coverage of what was believed to be the most expensive apartment sale on

178
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,140
the African continent to date in Rwanda.

179
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,680
But acknowledging the difficulty the real estate boom presented to housing everyone

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,780
else, Dos Santos had promised in his 2008 presidential campaign to build a million homes

181
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,540
by 2012.

182
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,940
In 2012, however, even the pared-down post-election version of this promise faltered.

183
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,820
The first 2,800 apartments went up for sale in the brand-new Kalama neighborhood, which

184
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,900
would eventually have capacity for 200,000 working-class residents.

185
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,900
At six months in, just 220 of those homes had been sold, due to the fact that the very

186
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,860
working-class residents they were built for couldn't afford or finance them.

187
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:27,300
But the next year, Angola was celebrated the world over, as Isabel Dos Santos, the president's

188
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,380
daughter, had become the first African woman ever to make the Forbes billionaires list,

189
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,580
with an estimated net worth north of $3 billion.

190
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,840
It wasn't South Africa, or Nigeria, or any of the continent's other traditional centers

191
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,720
of wealth to earn this honor, but rather tiny, scrappy Angola.

192
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,300
Dos Santos owned significant stakes in banks, media companies, and sale providers in Angola

193
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,840
and Portugal—a home on the private island of the exclusive Bulgari Resort in Dubai,

194
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,920
a $16 million home in the affluent Kensington neighborhood of London, a comparatively modest

195
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,360
$1.8 million penthouse apartment in Lisbon, a $55 million villa just steps away from the

196
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,080
Casino de Monte Carlo in Monaco, and to go with it, a $35 million, 50-meter, 164-foot

197
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,400
yacht anchored in the Mediterranean below.

198
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:20,400
And in 2016, her fortunes, both literal and figurative, only increased as her father fired

199
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,120
the entire board of Sonigal, Angola's national oil company, and replaced it with a sole chairwoman—Isabel

200
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,160
Dos Santos herself.

201
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,200
She was now in charge of the most powerful company in the country, making her perhaps

202
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,360
the country's second most powerful person after her father himself.

203
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,720
However, just months earlier, he had announced his imminent retirement.

204
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,680
Jose Eduardo Dos Santos would pass the torch, and Angola would have a new president—for

205
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,020
the first time in 38 years.

206
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,480
The president and his party planned for longtime MKLA politician João Lorenzo to take the

207
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,400
reins, which he did on September 26, 2017.

208
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,280
But then things went less to plan.

209
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,420
Isabel Dos Santos was quickly fired from her leading position at Sonigal, while her

210
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,760
half-brother, who had been leading the country's sovereign wealth fund, was arrested on corruption

211
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,200
and money laundering charges.

212
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Out of nowhere, João Lorenzo turned on the Dos Santos family, and asked the question

213
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:23,960
no powerful MPLA leader had ever dared—was it merely a coincidence that Africa's wealthiest

214
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,040
woman was the daughter of Angola's most powerful man, or was something more nefarious

215
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,360
going on?

216
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,340
Quietly, this question had been circling around the international business community

217
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:40,080
for years, and by the mid-2010s, some were formulating informed opinions.

218
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,880
Western banks like Citigroup and Berkeley backed out of deals with the businesswoman,

219
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,320
InterTrust and ING closed accounts linked to her and her husband, and Sonigal officials

220
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,600
rallied against Dos Santos' alleged mismanagement of funds.

221
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,720
For her part, Dos Santos pushed back, arguing that claims of illegality were unfounded and

222
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,360
that the banks had anti-African biases.

223
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,040
Then, in 2020, as rumors swirled, accusations mounted, and investigations dug deeper, the

224
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,300
world was offered its clearest view yet into Dos Santos' business dealings through a

225
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,840
landslide of private documents called the Luanda Leaks.

226
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,800
Captured by a notorious Portuguese whistleblower, passed through the Paris-based platform to

227
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,360
protect whistleblowers in Africa, then analyzed and disseminated by the International Consortium

228
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,840
of Investigative Journalists, the 715,000 leaked memos, emails, contracts, and meeting

229
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,600
minutes corroborated many of the suspicions and outright accusations lobbed at the former

230
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,400
president's daughter.

231
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,840
At practically every turn in her empire-building career, the documents showed, Isabel Dos Santos

232
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,860
benefited from insider dealmaking that landed her one massive government contract after

233
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,280
the next.

234
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,800
In 1999, there was the brand new mobile phone company Unitel, of which she owned a 25% share,

235
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,300
being granted a valuable telecoms license by the government.

236
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,000
In 2015, there was the Isabel Dos Santos-led urban redevelopment project being greenlit

237
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,360
by presidential decree that, the leaked documents later showed, was drafted by her own lawyers.

238
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,680
At every opportunity, major government undertakings seemingly designed to help everyday Angolans

239
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,560
were being routed through various Isabel Dos Santos holdings.

240
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,680
Beyond the murky, uncompetitive doling out of government contracts, Dos Santos and her

241
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,880
husband Sandika Dokolo further bolstered their own wealth through fraudulent deals

242
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,920
and creative accounting which, in turn, further stunted the development of the Angolan economy.

243
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,200
In addition to the $1 billion in dividends Dos Santos made, and the $1 billion stake

244
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,780
she still owned in Unitel, now the nation's largest telecom provider, Dos Santos also

245
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,400
went ahead and set up another company called Unitel International Holdings, which she lent

246
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,000
upwards of $460 million from Unitel, signing off as both the lender and the borrower and

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,300
leaving the Unitel board utterly dumbfounded.

248
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,580
The money made from shady insider deals like this then went on to cycle through or open

249
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:02,600
a vast array of shell companies in places like the British Virgin Islands and Malta,

250
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,800
where tax burdens and government oversight would be low or nonexistent.

251
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,680
This international expansion, leaks would prove, explained why companies like Malta's

252
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,940
Wise Intelligent Solutions, with herself and her husband as sole shareholders and only

253
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,180
a handful of staff with no expertise in oil, were being awarded contracts to restructure

254
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,280
a floundering Senegal in 2015.

255
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,640
All told, the ICIJ analysis of the Luanda leaks claimed that the Dos Santos and Dokolo

256
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,560
empire was made up of more than 400 companies and subsidiaries, spanning 41 countries with

257
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:36,040
at least 94 stashed in secrecy jurisdictions like Malta.

258
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,120
Despite painstakingly poring over these 70,000 documents, journalists helped to substantiate

259
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,680
what skeptical onlookers have been claiming since 2013—that the Dos Santos empire was

260
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,040
hardly something to be celebrated.

261
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,160
Rather than a signal that Angola was on the rise, Isabel Dos Santos' ill-gotten wealth

262
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,660
was actually going a long way in keeping average Angolans down.

263
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:02,080
In late 2020, President Lorenzo claimed that the government of José Eduardo Dos Santos

264
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:08,400
had squandered away and outright stolen an estimated $24 billion of the Angolan government,

265
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,200
and therefore the Angolan people's money.

266
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,700
Angola's story is tragically unoriginal—an African country that strikes it rich with

267
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,600
natural resources, but where poverty and pain persist for all but the powerful few.

268
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,040
Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, Zambia—the same narrative plays out time

269
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,480
and time again across the continent, crippling the people's futures.

270
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,440
This natural wealth-economic poverty paradox is so common in development economics that

271
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,800
it has a name, the resource curse, and while this continent propagates the phenomenon,

272
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,120
it's observed globally.

273
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,440
Simply, natural resources rarely propel people out of poverty.

274
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,900
But today, there's the benefit of hindsight.

275
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,740
Education and cronyism is now identifiably the evil holding the people back, so as dictators

276
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,060
die out, democracies across Africa have the opportunity to try something new.

277
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:11,420
On August 24th, 2022, Angolans will head to their polling places to decide whether Joao

278
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,180
Lorenzo and his MPLA party will earn a second term, or if UNITA, for the first time ever,

279
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,980
will take control of the country.

280
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,740
Arrigingly, both parties' campaigns are centered around defeating corruption.

281
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,020
While one candidate points to his past action investigating and punishing his predecessors,

282
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,820
the other says he didn't go far enough, and is charting out a path for more systematic

283
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,020
reform.

284
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,900
Angola has a long way to go, and starting from behind, but the oil's still there,

285
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,100
it's still producing millions of barrels per day, and billions are still left in the

286
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,100
ground.

287
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,860
If the people can accurately predict which candidate will stick to their word, which

288
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,100
candidate will find a path to turn natural wealth into human wealth, then all is not

289
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:59,020
lost for Angola—it still has a chance of breaking the resource curse.

290
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,580
If you're anything like me, you probably spend an embarrassing amount of time scrolling

291
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,380
through streaming sites trying to find something good to watch.

292
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,300
Well, to stop you from doing that tonight, I have a seminal list of a whole evening's

293
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,820
worth of entertainment that any Wendover viewer is sure to enjoy.

294
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,660
To start out with, there's the first episode of our new season of Extremities, which does

295
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,380
a deep dive into why the US holds onto the tiny, mid-Pacific territory of Wake Island

296
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,540
through first-hand interviews with those who have lived and worked there.

297
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,260
A small hint—it has a whole lot to do with airplanes.

298
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,860
Next you should give the latest episode of PolyMatter's series China Axia Watch, where

299
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,540
he explains how the country manages to survive and thrive with essentially zero major international

300
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,540
allies.

301
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,560
Finally, you should watch Half as Interesting's Crime Spree, the pilot season of our travel

302
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,560
competition show Jet Lag, where my writers chase me across the country as I attempt to

303
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,740
complete challenges as I go.

304
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,040
Each of these, and so much more, is exclusive to either Nebula or CuriosityStream, two fantastic

305
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,340
streaming sites.

306
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,840
The first was founded by myself and a bunch of other educational creators to be the best

307
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,500
home to the stuff we make, allowing us to make higher-budget, more controversial, more

308
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,280
unique or other sorts of videos that just don't work on YouTube.

309
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,920
Meanwhile, CuriosityStream was founded by the same people as Discovery Channel, and

310
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,440
hosts all sorts of fantastic STEM-oriented documentaries and shows, including our series

311
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Extremities.

312
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,400
And what's great about these two sites is you don't have to choose.
