00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,940
Since November 2nd, 2000, the International Space Station has been continuously crewed

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,740
meaning humanity has had a permanent presence in space.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:21,540
The importance of this station cannot be overstated.

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:26,380
NASA has literally filled a book with all the ways the ISS has benefited humans on earth.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,280
It's helped develop new cancer treatments, enhanced robot surgery technology, improved

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,320
data processing techniques—its benefits stretch far and wide.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,600
It is quite possibly the most significant science experiment humanity has ever undertaken.

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,740
It is also quite possibly the most expensive single item humanity has ever built at an

11
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,080
overall cost, so far, of about $160 billion.

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,880
Breaking that down, each day that each astronaut spends on the ISS costs about $7.5 million.

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,360
The ISS is a joint project between Russia's Roscosmos Agency, Japan's JAXA, Europe's

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,600
ESA, Canada's CSA, and the US's NASA.

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,640
Physically, though, it's split up into the Russian segment and the US segment with these

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,920
two countries more or less taking responsibility for managing and supplying their side.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,580
At over 350 feet or 110 meters long, the station is longer than a 747 and has more

18
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,640
interior space than the average six bedroom house.

19
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,320
Space is still at a premium, though, as science experiments and equipment take out most of

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,440
the room so normally there are only a maximum of six crew members onboard at any given time.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,320
Back on earth, though, there are thousands of people working to support the activities

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,840
of those six.

23
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,340
Now that the International Space Station is built and operating, the whole mission is

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,300
basically a big logistics problem.

25
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,040
It involves getting people, food, water, supplies, and experiments up and down from the station

26
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,300
in a consistent, cost-effective, and safe manner.

27
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,440
Food, as an example, is one of the only completely non-renewable resources onboard the ISS.

28
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,780
Water can be recycled, oxygen can be generated, supplies can be reused, but food is one and

29
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,780
done.

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,880
That means there has to be consistent shipments from earth to the station.

31
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,020
About half the food is supplied by the Russians and the other half by the Americans.

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,560
There are a few constraints to space food—it has to be shelf-stable as there are no refrigerators

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,760
onboard, it has to last about two years as resupplies only happen a few times a year,

34
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,760
it has to be light as weight is precious on the resupply rockets, and it has to be easy

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,400
to prepare as astronauts' time is valuable.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,120
Within those parameters, the Russians use a system of canned food while the Americans

37
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,800
use a system of flexible pouches which have the advantage of being lighter weight than

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,860
the cans.

39
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:41,400
This NASA food is produced at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,960
Long before they launch, the astronauts do a taste test to determine which foods they

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,720
like most and they express these preferences.

42
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,160
Based off those, NASA will produce and load more of the best-liked foods.

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,900
The astronauts can choose from hundreds of items—spaghetti and meatballs, barbecue

44
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,440
beef brisket, Caribbean chicken, vegetable quiche, beef enchiladas, the options go on

45
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,440
and on.

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,260
Somewhat surprisingly, the ingredients for the food are just purchased at a grocery store

47
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,740
like any other meal.

48
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:11,180
There's no special sourcing or special ingredients, although they do inspect the ingredients carefully

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,120
after buying to be extra sure that they're safe.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,380
As far as we know, no astronaut has yet gotten food poisoning in space and NASA wants to

51
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,540
keep it that way.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,900
The food is then prepared fairly conventionally until the last step.

53
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,740
Food is made shelf-stable and light-weight by one of two methods—thermostabilization

54
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,060
or freeze-drying.

55
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,400
With thermostabilization, heat is used to destroy microorganisms and enzymes that would

56
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,000
cause food to spoil.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,260
With freeze-drying, the food is frozen and then almost all moisture is removed.

58
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,960
With this technique, there is nearly no water left in the food, which is normally the bulk

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,800
of the weight, so a full serving of spaghetti, for example, weighs only 1 ounce or 28 grams.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,360
The space station has a water recycling system that recovers about 80% of the water on board

61
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,920
which means that, while they do occasionally have to resupply water from earth, it's

62
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,840
more efficient to ship food up without water in it since the water on board can be reused

63
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,440
for multiple meals and that also helps keep it shelf-stable.

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,360
Overall, freeze-drying reduces the total food weight they have to take up.

65
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,500
NASA currently pays about $29,000 per pound for shipment to the space station.

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,840
Each gallon of water they bring therefore costs them about a quarter of a million dollars.

67
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,000
That also means that each of those 1 ounce portions of spaghetti costs them about $1,800.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,920
They'll also typically include a few pieces of fresh fruit any time a rocket goes up as

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:35,040
a treat and, with these shipment costs, each apple is worth almost $10,000.

70
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,360
This is why so much focus is put on minimizing weight.

71
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,600
In addition to the food they make, some foods are just shipped up as is.

72
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,380
For example, if a crew member has a particular type of granola bar they like, the food preparation

73
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:51,360
team will go out and buy some of those as a sample and perform some tests in their lab

74
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,780
to figure out if it's, as they call it, flight compatible.

75
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,160
In that, they're basically looking to be sure that it's not too crumbly as they don't

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
like crumbs floating around into all the nooks and crannies of the station as well

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,120
as being sure it's not too liquidy both for the purposes of weight and to be sure

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,880
that it doesn't cause free liquid to float around.

79
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,480
Assuming it passes these tests, astronauts can pretty much bring what they want for snacks.

80
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,660
It will be repackaged into NASA's pouches, but there's a surprising amount of simply

81
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,220
store-bought food on the station.

82
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,760
Once all food is produced and packaged, it is shipped to one of four launch sites—either

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,920
the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia where Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupplies spacecraft

84
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,720
are launched from, Cape Canaveral, Florida where SpaceX Dragon spacecraft are launched

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,800
from, Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan where Russian Progress resupply and Soyuz crew spacecraft

86
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,160
are launched from, or Tanegashima Space Center in Japan where Japanese Konotori spacecraft

87
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,340
are launched from.

88
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:46,180
The food will be carefully packed alongside everything else making the trip ensuring proper

89
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,560
spacecraft balance.

90
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,340
Thanks to all these weight-saving techniques, supplies for crew, including food, only represent

91
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,400
a small portion of the overall weight for each launch.

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,160
For example, on one SpaceX launch, crew supplies only represented 530 pounds or 240 kilograms

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,700
of the 6,000 pounds or 2,700 kilograms of cargo.

94
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,720
The rest of the launch capacity is dedicated to equipment and experiments.

95
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,480
Now, part of the difficulty of this supply chain is that launch dates change a lot.

96
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,400
For example, the last SpaceX resupply, CRS-16, was initially scheduled for August 2018, then

97
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,160
it was pushed back to the 29th of November, then till December 4th, then again to December

98
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,860
5th when it finally launched.

99
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,600
These delays can come from quite mundane issues.

100
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,280
The December 4th to December 5th delay, for example, came because it was found that the

101
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,960
food loaded for lab mice who were making the trip was moldy and had to be replaced.

102
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,800
Even just getting a launch or landing date in the first place is difficult enough.

103
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,320
Each site has its own set of constraints potentially preventing use.

104
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,520
For example, Tanegashima Space Center in Japan can only be used for launch at certain times

105
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,400
of year since, during fishing season, there are a large number of ships offshore from

106
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,760
the launch site which could be hit and damaged if a rocket exploded.

107
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,240
Elsewhere, a Soyuz landing in Kazakhstan had to be rescheduled as there was a G8 summit

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,840
nearby which, for security reasons, imposed airspace restrictions that prevented spacecraft

109
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,040
search and rescue aircraft from flying.

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,140
Even the angle of the sun relative to the ISS constrains when a spacecraft can dock.

111
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,960
The other factor that can affect the supply chain is that rockets are imperfect.

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,160
Five of the 117 resupply missions to date to the International Space Station did not

113
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,000
make it, for one reason or another, meaning there's a failure rate of 4.3%.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,640
There was even a nine month stretch from 2014 to 2015 when three resupply missions failed.

115
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,600
In times like these, it's quite important that the ISS has plenty of backup food, water,

116
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
and supplies.

117
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,240
While the astronauts would never starve, running out of food or water could mean that they

118
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,600
would have to return to earth early, potentially leaving the ISS uncrewed and therefore wasting

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,400
many millions or billions of dollars.

120
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,020
When that third mission failed on June 28th, 2015, the station had enough food to last

121
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,400
them for about another 50 days.

122
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,020
In this case, even with three failed missions, they had plenty of food to last them especially

123
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,080
considering the next resupply mission, a Russian Progress spacecraft, was scheduled just a

124
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,040
week after the failure and it was successful.

125
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,880
There have been close calls, though.

126
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,880
After the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, astronauts had to cut their daily

127
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,360
caloric intake and supplies got as low as 7 to 14 days of food.

128
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,760
They were one resupply failure away from having to evacuate.

129
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,080
Sometimes, in order to stretch the food supply, NASA will have to extend the certified shelf

130
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,800
life of food on board.

131
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,000
For this purpose, they keep a sample of each batch of food they make on earth, packaged

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,440
and stored in the exact same conditions as on the ISS so they can test if food is still

133
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,680
fit for consumption and safe.

134
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Assuming a rocket doesn't have any issues, it will typically make it to the ISS in about

135
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,480
two to three days.

136
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,700
Once the spacecraft is near the ISS, the crew will spend almost a whole working day dealing

137
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,400
with the docking process.

138
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Once that's completed, either the same day or the next morning, they'll open the hatch.

139
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,120
Typically right at the hatch is the crew care package.

140
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,440
This will include those fresh fruit and vegetables as well as some items sent up by the crew's

141
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
families.

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,320
One time, the crew care package even included real ice cream.

143
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,200
While there isn't normally a freezer on board, in this instance a portable freezer

144
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,800
was sent up in order to transport samples from an experiment back to earth but, since

145
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,000
it was empty on the trip up, the crew got this treat.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,640
Over the next few months, astronauts will go through their food one container at a time

147
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,600
scanning a barcode each time they open one to let mission control know what their inventory

148
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,080
level is like.

149
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:31,400
That way, if food is going quicker or more slowly than expected, NASA can adjust future

150
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
shipments.

151
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,720
On board, dehydrated food is heated up and hydrated using a food rehydrator while other

152
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,160
food can be heated up using another heater.

153
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,660
The point of putting so much effort into food on the ISS is for the psychological well-being

154
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,000
of the astronauts.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,400
With working long hours bottled up in a small space for up to a year, the mental stress

156
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,680
of the job is enormous so any effort that can help reduce that is an effort worth doing.

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,840
As part of this, NASA puts a good amount of work into movie night.

158
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,840
They have a large projector screen and, in addition to their onboard digital library

159
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,560
of about 500 movies, the crew can download new movies.

160
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,520
The ISS does have an internet connection and they've been known to get some movies such

161
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,000
as Star Wars The Last Jedi while they're still in theaters.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,920
That same internet connection lets astronauts browse the web quite freely even if it's

163
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
not quick.

164
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,960
While the station does have 300 megabits per second of downlink capacity, the vast majority

165
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,120
of it is dedicated to experiment and other data but astronauts are able to regularly

166
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,480
video call their families using it.

167
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,380
The unloading process of resupply vessels is quite a slow process, partially just because

168
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,040
there isn't much storage space onboard.

169
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,220
Once a resupply vessel is unloaded, though, the crew will start loading it again with

170
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,220
trash.

171
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:46,500
The Northrop Grumman Cygnus, Russian Progress, and Japanese Konatori spacecraft cannot return

172
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,500
to earth so they just burn up in the atmosphere along with all the trash.

173
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,820
The SpaceX Dragon and crewed Russian Soyuz spacecraft do return to earth so they can

174
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,140
bring back samples and experiments.

175
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,740
Once ready, the spacecraft will undock and slowly drift away from the ISS until it disappears

176
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:07,220
from view and at that point, the ISS is ready for another delivery of humans or cargo—one

177
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,820
of the most unique regular deliveries in our universe.

178
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,180
Rocket science is something that always seems out of reach for mere mortals.

179
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,340
It's something that's supposed to be the most confusing and complex area of study but

180
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,600
you can actually get started learning rocket science right now with brilliant.org's classical

181
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,020
mechanics course.

182
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,280
They use their unique style of teaching to help you understand the physics that make

183
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,140
rockets work.

184
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,060
Brilliant is the expert in teaching complex concepts like this because they teach you

185
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,720
the intuitive principles behind the concepts and then help guide you to put it all back

186
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,920
together to the point where you can understand how things work.

187
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,760
Some very exciting news is that Brilliant now allows you to download their courses offline
