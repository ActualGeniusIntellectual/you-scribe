00:09.940 --> 00:14.940
Since November 2nd, 2000, the International Space Station has been continuously crewed

00:14.940 --> 00:18.740
meaning humanity has had a permanent presence in space.

00:18.740 --> 00:21.540
The importance of this station cannot be overstated.

00:21.540 --> 00:26.380
NASA has literally filled a book with all the ways the ISS has benefited humans on earth.

00:26.380 --> 00:31.280
It's helped develop new cancer treatments, enhanced robot surgery technology, improved

00:31.280 --> 00:35.320
data processing techniques—its benefits stretch far and wide.

00:35.320 --> 00:40.600
It is quite possibly the most significant science experiment humanity has ever undertaken.

00:40.600 --> 00:45.740
It is also quite possibly the most expensive single item humanity has ever built at an

00:45.740 --> 00:51.080
overall cost, so far, of about $160 billion.

00:51.080 --> 00:58.880
Breaking that down, each day that each astronaut spends on the ISS costs about $7.5 million.

00:58.880 --> 01:04.360
The ISS is a joint project between Russia's Roscosmos Agency, Japan's JAXA, Europe's

01:04.360 --> 01:07.600
ESA, Canada's CSA, and the US's NASA.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.640
Physically, though, it's split up into the Russian segment and the US segment with these

01:11.640 --> 01:15.920
two countries more or less taking responsibility for managing and supplying their side.

01:15.920 --> 01:21.580
At over 350 feet or 110 meters long, the station is longer than a 747 and has more

01:21.580 --> 01:24.640
interior space than the average six bedroom house.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.320
Space is still at a premium, though, as science experiments and equipment take out most of

01:28.320 --> 01:33.440
the room so normally there are only a maximum of six crew members onboard at any given time.

01:33.440 --> 01:37.320
Back on earth, though, there are thousands of people working to support the activities

01:37.320 --> 01:38.840
of those six.

01:38.840 --> 01:42.340
Now that the International Space Station is built and operating, the whole mission is

01:42.340 --> 01:44.300
basically a big logistics problem.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.040
It involves getting people, food, water, supplies, and experiments up and down from the station

01:49.040 --> 01:52.300
in a consistent, cost-effective, and safe manner.

01:52.300 --> 01:58.440
Food, as an example, is one of the only completely non-renewable resources onboard the ISS.

01:58.440 --> 02:03.780
Water can be recycled, oxygen can be generated, supplies can be reused, but food is one and

02:03.780 --> 02:04.780
done.

02:04.780 --> 02:08.880
That means there has to be consistent shipments from earth to the station.

02:08.880 --> 02:13.020
About half the food is supplied by the Russians and the other half by the Americans.

02:13.020 --> 02:17.560
There are a few constraints to space food—it has to be shelf-stable as there are no refrigerators

02:17.560 --> 02:21.760
onboard, it has to last about two years as resupplies only happen a few times a year,

02:21.760 --> 02:25.760
it has to be light as weight is precious on the resupply rockets, and it has to be easy

02:25.760 --> 02:28.400
to prepare as astronauts' time is valuable.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.120
Within those parameters, the Russians use a system of canned food while the Americans

02:32.120 --> 02:35.800
use a system of flexible pouches which have the advantage of being lighter weight than

02:35.800 --> 02:36.860
the cans.

02:36.860 --> 02:41.400
This NASA food is produced at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.960
Long before they launch, the astronauts do a taste test to determine which foods they

02:44.960 --> 02:47.720
like most and they express these preferences.

02:47.720 --> 02:52.160
Based off those, NASA will produce and load more of the best-liked foods.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.900
The astronauts can choose from hundreds of items—spaghetti and meatballs, barbecue

02:55.900 --> 03:00.440
beef brisket, Caribbean chicken, vegetable quiche, beef enchiladas, the options go on

03:00.440 --> 03:01.440
and on.

03:01.440 --> 03:05.260
Somewhat surprisingly, the ingredients for the food are just purchased at a grocery store

03:05.260 --> 03:06.740
like any other meal.

03:06.740 --> 03:11.180
There's no special sourcing or special ingredients, although they do inspect the ingredients carefully

03:11.180 --> 03:14.120
after buying to be extra sure that they're safe.

03:14.120 --> 03:18.380
As far as we know, no astronaut has yet gotten food poisoning in space and NASA wants to

03:18.380 --> 03:19.540
keep it that way.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.900
The food is then prepared fairly conventionally until the last step.

03:22.900 --> 03:27.740
Food is made shelf-stable and light-weight by one of two methods—thermostabilization

03:27.740 --> 03:29.060
or freeze-drying.

03:29.060 --> 03:33.400
With thermostabilization, heat is used to destroy microorganisms and enzymes that would

03:33.400 --> 03:35.000
cause food to spoil.

03:35.000 --> 03:39.260
With freeze-drying, the food is frozen and then almost all moisture is removed.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.960
With this technique, there is nearly no water left in the food, which is normally the bulk

03:42.960 --> 03:48.800
of the weight, so a full serving of spaghetti, for example, weighs only 1 ounce or 28 grams.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.360
The space station has a water recycling system that recovers about 80% of the water on board

03:53.360 --> 03:56.920
which means that, while they do occasionally have to resupply water from earth, it's

03:56.920 --> 04:00.840
more efficient to ship food up without water in it since the water on board can be reused

04:00.840 --> 04:03.440
for multiple meals and that also helps keep it shelf-stable.

04:03.880 --> 04:08.360
Overall, freeze-drying reduces the total food weight they have to take up.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.500
NASA currently pays about $29,000 per pound for shipment to the space station.

04:13.500 --> 04:18.840
Each gallon of water they bring therefore costs them about a quarter of a million dollars.

04:18.840 --> 04:24.000
That also means that each of those 1 ounce portions of spaghetti costs them about $1,800.

04:24.000 --> 04:28.920
They'll also typically include a few pieces of fresh fruit any time a rocket goes up as

04:28.920 --> 04:35.040
a treat and, with these shipment costs, each apple is worth almost $10,000.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.360
This is why so much focus is put on minimizing weight.

04:38.360 --> 04:42.600
In addition to the food they make, some foods are just shipped up as is.

04:42.600 --> 04:47.380
For example, if a crew member has a particular type of granola bar they like, the food preparation

04:47.380 --> 04:51.360
team will go out and buy some of those as a sample and perform some tests in their lab

04:51.360 --> 04:54.780
to figure out if it's, as they call it, flight compatible.

04:54.780 --> 04:58.160
In that, they're basically looking to be sure that it's not too crumbly as they don't

04:58.160 --> 05:01.520
like crumbs floating around into all the nooks and crannies of the station as well

05:01.520 --> 05:05.120
as being sure it's not too liquidy both for the purposes of weight and to be sure

05:05.120 --> 05:07.880
that it doesn't cause free liquid to float around.

05:07.880 --> 05:12.480
Assuming it passes these tests, astronauts can pretty much bring what they want for snacks.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.660
It will be repackaged into NASA's pouches, but there's a surprising amount of simply

05:16.660 --> 05:19.220
store-bought food on the station.

05:19.220 --> 05:23.760
Once all food is produced and packaged, it is shipped to one of four launch sites—either

05:23.760 --> 05:27.920
the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia where Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupplies spacecraft

05:27.920 --> 05:31.720
are launched from, Cape Canaveral, Florida where SpaceX Dragon spacecraft are launched

05:31.720 --> 05:36.800
from, Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan where Russian Progress resupply and Soyuz crew spacecraft

05:36.800 --> 05:41.160
are launched from, or Tanegashima Space Center in Japan where Japanese Konotori spacecraft

05:41.160 --> 05:42.340
are launched from.

05:42.340 --> 05:46.180
The food will be carefully packed alongside everything else making the trip ensuring proper

05:46.180 --> 05:47.560
spacecraft balance.

05:47.560 --> 05:52.340
Thanks to all these weight-saving techniques, supplies for crew, including food, only represent

05:52.340 --> 05:55.400
a small portion of the overall weight for each launch.

05:55.400 --> 06:01.160
For example, on one SpaceX launch, crew supplies only represented 530 pounds or 240 kilograms

06:01.160 --> 06:04.700
of the 6,000 pounds or 2,700 kilograms of cargo.

06:04.700 --> 06:08.720
The rest of the launch capacity is dedicated to equipment and experiments.

06:08.720 --> 06:14.480
Now, part of the difficulty of this supply chain is that launch dates change a lot.

06:14.480 --> 06:20.400
For example, the last SpaceX resupply, CRS-16, was initially scheduled for August 2018, then

06:20.400 --> 06:25.160
it was pushed back to the 29th of November, then till December 4th, then again to December

06:25.160 --> 06:26.860
5th when it finally launched.

06:26.860 --> 06:29.600
These delays can come from quite mundane issues.

06:29.600 --> 06:33.280
The December 4th to December 5th delay, for example, came because it was found that the

06:33.280 --> 06:37.960
food loaded for lab mice who were making the trip was moldy and had to be replaced.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.800
Even just getting a launch or landing date in the first place is difficult enough.

06:41.800 --> 06:45.320
Each site has its own set of constraints potentially preventing use.

06:45.320 --> 06:49.520
For example, Tanegashima Space Center in Japan can only be used for launch at certain times

06:49.520 --> 06:53.400
of year since, during fishing season, there are a large number of ships offshore from

06:53.400 --> 06:56.760
the launch site which could be hit and damaged if a rocket exploded.

06:56.760 --> 07:01.240
Elsewhere, a Soyuz landing in Kazakhstan had to be rescheduled as there was a G8 summit

07:01.240 --> 07:05.840
nearby which, for security reasons, imposed airspace restrictions that prevented spacecraft

07:05.840 --> 07:08.040
search and rescue aircraft from flying.

07:08.040 --> 07:13.140
Even the angle of the sun relative to the ISS constrains when a spacecraft can dock.

07:13.140 --> 07:17.960
The other factor that can affect the supply chain is that rockets are imperfect.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.160
Five of the 117 resupply missions to date to the International Space Station did not

07:22.160 --> 07:27.000
make it, for one reason or another, meaning there's a failure rate of 4.3%.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.640
There was even a nine month stretch from 2014 to 2015 when three resupply missions failed.

07:32.640 --> 07:37.600
In times like these, it's quite important that the ISS has plenty of backup food, water,

07:37.600 --> 07:38.600
and supplies.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.240
While the astronauts would never starve, running out of food or water could mean that they

07:42.240 --> 07:46.600
would have to return to earth early, potentially leaving the ISS uncrewed and therefore wasting

07:46.600 --> 07:49.400
many millions or billions of dollars.

07:49.400 --> 07:54.020
When that third mission failed on June 28th, 2015, the station had enough food to last

07:54.020 --> 07:56.400
them for about another 50 days.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.020
In this case, even with three failed missions, they had plenty of food to last them especially

08:01.020 --> 08:05.080
considering the next resupply mission, a Russian Progress spacecraft, was scheduled just a

08:05.080 --> 08:08.040
week after the failure and it was successful.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.880
There have been close calls, though.

08:09.880 --> 08:13.880
After the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, astronauts had to cut their daily

08:13.880 --> 08:18.360
caloric intake and supplies got as low as 7 to 14 days of food.

08:18.360 --> 08:21.760
They were one resupply failure away from having to evacuate.

08:21.760 --> 08:26.080
Sometimes, in order to stretch the food supply, NASA will have to extend the certified shelf

08:26.080 --> 08:27.800
life of food on board.

08:27.800 --> 08:32.000
For this purpose, they keep a sample of each batch of food they make on earth, packaged

08:32.000 --> 08:36.440
and stored in the exact same conditions as on the ISS so they can test if food is still

08:36.440 --> 08:38.680
fit for consumption and safe.

08:38.680 --> 08:42.680
Assuming a rocket doesn't have any issues, it will typically make it to the ISS in about

08:42.680 --> 08:44.480
two to three days.

08:44.480 --> 08:48.700
Once the spacecraft is near the ISS, the crew will spend almost a whole working day dealing

08:48.700 --> 08:50.400
with the docking process.

08:50.400 --> 08:55.280
Once that's completed, either the same day or the next morning, they'll open the hatch.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.120
Typically right at the hatch is the crew care package.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.440
This will include those fresh fruit and vegetables as well as some items sent up by the crew's

09:02.440 --> 09:03.440
families.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.320
One time, the crew care package even included real ice cream.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.200
While there isn't normally a freezer on board, in this instance a portable freezer

09:10.200 --> 09:14.800
was sent up in order to transport samples from an experiment back to earth but, since

09:14.800 --> 09:18.000
it was empty on the trip up, the crew got this treat.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.640
Over the next few months, astronauts will go through their food one container at a time

09:21.640 --> 09:25.600
scanning a barcode each time they open one to let mission control know what their inventory

09:25.600 --> 09:27.080
level is like.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.400
That way, if food is going quicker or more slowly than expected, NASA can adjust future

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
shipments.

09:32.400 --> 09:36.720
On board, dehydrated food is heated up and hydrated using a food rehydrator while other

09:36.720 --> 09:39.160
food can be heated up using another heater.

09:39.160 --> 09:43.660
The point of putting so much effort into food on the ISS is for the psychological well-being

09:43.660 --> 09:45.000
of the astronauts.

09:45.000 --> 09:49.400
With working long hours bottled up in a small space for up to a year, the mental stress

09:49.400 --> 09:54.680
of the job is enormous so any effort that can help reduce that is an effort worth doing.

09:54.680 --> 09:58.840
As part of this, NASA puts a good amount of work into movie night.

09:58.840 --> 10:02.840
They have a large projector screen and, in addition to their onboard digital library

10:02.840 --> 10:06.560
of about 500 movies, the crew can download new movies.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.520
The ISS does have an internet connection and they've been known to get some movies such

10:10.520 --> 10:14.000
as Star Wars The Last Jedi while they're still in theaters.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.920
That same internet connection lets astronauts browse the web quite freely even if it's

10:17.920 --> 10:18.920
not quick.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.960
While the station does have 300 megabits per second of downlink capacity, the vast majority

10:22.960 --> 10:27.120
of it is dedicated to experiment and other data but astronauts are able to regularly

10:27.120 --> 10:29.480
video call their families using it.

10:29.480 --> 10:34.380
The unloading process of resupply vessels is quite a slow process, partially just because

10:34.380 --> 10:37.040
there isn't much storage space onboard.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.220
Once a resupply vessel is unloaded, though, the crew will start loading it again with

10:41.220 --> 10:42.220
trash.

10:42.220 --> 10:46.500
The Northrop Grumman Cygnus, Russian Progress, and Japanese Konatori spacecraft cannot return

10:46.500 --> 10:50.500
to earth so they just burn up in the atmosphere along with all the trash.

10:50.500 --> 10:54.820
The SpaceX Dragon and crewed Russian Soyuz spacecraft do return to earth so they can

10:54.820 --> 10:57.140
bring back samples and experiments.

10:57.140 --> 11:01.740
Once ready, the spacecraft will undock and slowly drift away from the ISS until it disappears

11:01.740 --> 11:07.220
from view and at that point, the ISS is ready for another delivery of humans or cargo—one

11:07.220 --> 11:11.820
of the most unique regular deliveries in our universe.

11:11.820 --> 11:15.180
Rocket science is something that always seems out of reach for mere mortals.

11:15.180 --> 11:19.340
