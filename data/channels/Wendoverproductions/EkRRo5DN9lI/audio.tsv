9940	14940	Since November 2nd, 2000, the International Space Station has been continuously crewed
14940	18740	meaning humanity has had a permanent presence in space.
18740	21540	The importance of this station cannot be overstated.
21540	26380	NASA has literally filled a book with all the ways the ISS has benefited humans on earth.
26380	31280	It's helped develop new cancer treatments, enhanced robot surgery technology, improved
31280	35320	data processing techniques—its benefits stretch far and wide.
35320	40600	It is quite possibly the most significant science experiment humanity has ever undertaken.
40600	45740	It is also quite possibly the most expensive single item humanity has ever built at an
45740	51080	overall cost, so far, of about $160 billion.
51080	58880	Breaking that down, each day that each astronaut spends on the ISS costs about $7.5 million.
58880	64360	The ISS is a joint project between Russia's Roscosmos Agency, Japan's JAXA, Europe's
64360	67600	ESA, Canada's CSA, and the US's NASA.
67600	71640	Physically, though, it's split up into the Russian segment and the US segment with these
71640	75920	two countries more or less taking responsibility for managing and supplying their side.
75920	81580	At over 350 feet or 110 meters long, the station is longer than a 747 and has more
81580	84640	interior space than the average six bedroom house.
84640	88320	Space is still at a premium, though, as science experiments and equipment take out most of
88320	93440	the room so normally there are only a maximum of six crew members onboard at any given time.
93440	97320	Back on earth, though, there are thousands of people working to support the activities
97320	98840	of those six.
98840	102340	Now that the International Space Station is built and operating, the whole mission is
102340	104300	basically a big logistics problem.
104300	109040	It involves getting people, food, water, supplies, and experiments up and down from the station
109040	112300	in a consistent, cost-effective, and safe manner.
112300	118440	Food, as an example, is one of the only completely non-renewable resources onboard the ISS.
118440	123780	Water can be recycled, oxygen can be generated, supplies can be reused, but food is one and
123780	124780	done.
124780	128880	That means there has to be consistent shipments from earth to the station.
128880	133020	About half the food is supplied by the Russians and the other half by the Americans.
133020	137560	There are a few constraints to space food—it has to be shelf-stable as there are no refrigerators
137560	141760	onboard, it has to last about two years as resupplies only happen a few times a year,
141760	145760	it has to be light as weight is precious on the resupply rockets, and it has to be easy
145760	148400	to prepare as astronauts' time is valuable.
148400	152120	Within those parameters, the Russians use a system of canned food while the Americans
152120	155800	use a system of flexible pouches which have the advantage of being lighter weight than
155800	156860	the cans.
156860	161400	This NASA food is produced at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.
161400	164960	Long before they launch, the astronauts do a taste test to determine which foods they
164960	167720	like most and they express these preferences.
167720	172160	Based off those, NASA will produce and load more of the best-liked foods.
172160	175900	The astronauts can choose from hundreds of items—spaghetti and meatballs, barbecue
175900	180440	beef brisket, Caribbean chicken, vegetable quiche, beef enchiladas, the options go on
180440	181440	and on.
181440	185260	Somewhat surprisingly, the ingredients for the food are just purchased at a grocery store
185260	186740	like any other meal.
186740	191180	There's no special sourcing or special ingredients, although they do inspect the ingredients carefully
191180	194120	after buying to be extra sure that they're safe.
194120	198380	As far as we know, no astronaut has yet gotten food poisoning in space and NASA wants to
198380	199540	keep it that way.
199540	202900	The food is then prepared fairly conventionally until the last step.
202900	207740	Food is made shelf-stable and light-weight by one of two methods—thermostabilization
207740	209060	or freeze-drying.
209060	213400	With thermostabilization, heat is used to destroy microorganisms and enzymes that would
213400	215000	cause food to spoil.
215000	219260	With freeze-drying, the food is frozen and then almost all moisture is removed.
219260	222960	With this technique, there is nearly no water left in the food, which is normally the bulk
222960	228800	of the weight, so a full serving of spaghetti, for example, weighs only 1 ounce or 28 grams.
228800	233360	The space station has a water recycling system that recovers about 80% of the water on board
233360	236920	which means that, while they do occasionally have to resupply water from earth, it's
236920	240840	more efficient to ship food up without water in it since the water on board can be reused
240840	243440	for multiple meals and that also helps keep it shelf-stable.
243880	248360	Overall, freeze-drying reduces the total food weight they have to take up.
248360	253500	NASA currently pays about $29,000 per pound for shipment to the space station.
253500	258840	Each gallon of water they bring therefore costs them about a quarter of a million dollars.
258840	264000	That also means that each of those 1 ounce portions of spaghetti costs them about $1,800.
264000	268920	They'll also typically include a few pieces of fresh fruit any time a rocket goes up as
268920	275040	a treat and, with these shipment costs, each apple is worth almost $10,000.
275040	278360	This is why so much focus is put on minimizing weight.
278360	282600	In addition to the food they make, some foods are just shipped up as is.
282600	287380	For example, if a crew member has a particular type of granola bar they like, the food preparation
287380	291360	team will go out and buy some of those as a sample and perform some tests in their lab
291360	294780	to figure out if it's, as they call it, flight compatible.
294780	298160	In that, they're basically looking to be sure that it's not too crumbly as they don't
298160	301520	like crumbs floating around into all the nooks and crannies of the station as well
301520	305120	as being sure it's not too liquidy both for the purposes of weight and to be sure
305120	307880	that it doesn't cause free liquid to float around.
307880	312480	Assuming it passes these tests, astronauts can pretty much bring what they want for snacks.
312480	316660	It will be repackaged into NASA's pouches, but there's a surprising amount of simply
316660	319220	store-bought food on the station.
319220	323760	Once all food is produced and packaged, it is shipped to one of four launch sites—either
323760	327920	the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia where Northrop Grumman Cygnus resupplies spacecraft
327920	331720	are launched from, Cape Canaveral, Florida where SpaceX Dragon spacecraft are launched
331720	336800	from, Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan where Russian Progress resupply and Soyuz crew spacecraft
336800	341160	are launched from, or Tanegashima Space Center in Japan where Japanese Konotori spacecraft
341160	342340	are launched from.
342340	346180	The food will be carefully packed alongside everything else making the trip ensuring proper
346180	347560	spacecraft balance.
347560	352340	Thanks to all these weight-saving techniques, supplies for crew, including food, only represent
352340	355400	a small portion of the overall weight for each launch.
355400	361160	For example, on one SpaceX launch, crew supplies only represented 530 pounds or 240 kilograms
361160	364700	of the 6,000 pounds or 2,700 kilograms of cargo.
364700	368720	The rest of the launch capacity is dedicated to equipment and experiments.
368720	374480	Now, part of the difficulty of this supply chain is that launch dates change a lot.
374480	380400	For example, the last SpaceX resupply, CRS-16, was initially scheduled for August 2018, then
380400	385160	it was pushed back to the 29th of November, then till December 4th, then again to December
385160	386860	5th when it finally launched.
386860	389600	These delays can come from quite mundane issues.
389600	393280	The December 4th to December 5th delay, for example, came because it was found that the
393280	397960	food loaded for lab mice who were making the trip was moldy and had to be replaced.
397960	401800	Even just getting a launch or landing date in the first place is difficult enough.
401800	405320	Each site has its own set of constraints potentially preventing use.
405320	409520	For example, Tanegashima Space Center in Japan can only be used for launch at certain times
409520	413400	of year since, during fishing season, there are a large number of ships offshore from
413400	416760	the launch site which could be hit and damaged if a rocket exploded.
416760	421240	Elsewhere, a Soyuz landing in Kazakhstan had to be rescheduled as there was a G8 summit
421240	425840	nearby which, for security reasons, imposed airspace restrictions that prevented spacecraft
425840	428040	search and rescue aircraft from flying.
428040	433140	Even the angle of the sun relative to the ISS constrains when a spacecraft can dock.
433140	437960	The other factor that can affect the supply chain is that rockets are imperfect.
437960	442160	Five of the 117 resupply missions to date to the International Space Station did not
442160	447000	make it, for one reason or another, meaning there's a failure rate of 4.3%.
447000	452640	There was even a nine month stretch from 2014 to 2015 when three resupply missions failed.
452640	457600	In times like these, it's quite important that the ISS has plenty of backup food, water,
457600	458600	and supplies.
458600	462240	While the astronauts would never starve, running out of food or water could mean that they
462240	466600	would have to return to earth early, potentially leaving the ISS uncrewed and therefore wasting
466600	469400	many millions or billions of dollars.
469400	474020	When that third mission failed on June 28th, 2015, the station had enough food to last
474020	476400	them for about another 50 days.
476400	481020	In this case, even with three failed missions, they had plenty of food to last them especially
481020	485080	considering the next resupply mission, a Russian Progress spacecraft, was scheduled just a
485080	488040	week after the failure and it was successful.
488040	489880	There have been close calls, though.
489880	493880	After the space shuttle Columbia disaster in 2003, astronauts had to cut their daily
493880	498360	caloric intake and supplies got as low as 7 to 14 days of food.
498360	501760	They were one resupply failure away from having to evacuate.
501760	506080	Sometimes, in order to stretch the food supply, NASA will have to extend the certified shelf
506080	507800	life of food on board.
507800	512000	For this purpose, they keep a sample of each batch of food they make on earth, packaged
512000	516440	and stored in the exact same conditions as on the ISS so they can test if food is still
516440	518680	fit for consumption and safe.
518680	522680	Assuming a rocket doesn't have any issues, it will typically make it to the ISS in about
522680	524480	two to three days.
524480	528700	Once the spacecraft is near the ISS, the crew will spend almost a whole working day dealing
528700	530400	with the docking process.
530400	535280	Once that's completed, either the same day or the next morning, they'll open the hatch.
535280	538120	Typically right at the hatch is the crew care package.
538120	542440	This will include those fresh fruit and vegetables as well as some items sent up by the crew's
542440	543440	families.
543440	546320	One time, the crew care package even included real ice cream.
546320	550200	While there isn't normally a freezer on board, in this instance a portable freezer
550200	554800	was sent up in order to transport samples from an experiment back to earth but, since
554800	558000	it was empty on the trip up, the crew got this treat.
558000	561640	Over the next few months, astronauts will go through their food one container at a time
561640	565600	scanning a barcode each time they open one to let mission control know what their inventory
565600	567080	level is like.
567080	571400	That way, if food is going quicker or more slowly than expected, NASA can adjust future
571400	572400	shipments.
572400	576720	On board, dehydrated food is heated up and hydrated using a food rehydrator while other
576720	579160	food can be heated up using another heater.
579160	583660	The point of putting so much effort into food on the ISS is for the psychological well-being
583660	585000	of the astronauts.
585000	589400	With working long hours bottled up in a small space for up to a year, the mental stress
589400	594680	of the job is enormous so any effort that can help reduce that is an effort worth doing.
594680	598840	As part of this, NASA puts a good amount of work into movie night.
598840	602840	They have a large projector screen and, in addition to their onboard digital library
602840	606560	of about 500 movies, the crew can download new movies.
606560	610520	The ISS does have an internet connection and they've been known to get some movies such
610520	614000	as Star Wars The Last Jedi while they're still in theaters.
614000	617920	That same internet connection lets astronauts browse the web quite freely even if it's
617920	618920	not quick.
618920	622960	While the station does have 300 megabits per second of downlink capacity, the vast majority
622960	627120	of it is dedicated to experiment and other data but astronauts are able to regularly
627120	629480	video call their families using it.
629480	634380	The unloading process of resupply vessels is quite a slow process, partially just because
634380	637040	there isn't much storage space onboard.
637040	641220	Once a resupply vessel is unloaded, though, the crew will start loading it again with
641220	642220	trash.
642220	646500	The Northrop Grumman Cygnus, Russian Progress, and Japanese Konatori spacecraft cannot return
646500	650500	to earth so they just burn up in the atmosphere along with all the trash.
650500	654820	The SpaceX Dragon and crewed Russian Soyuz spacecraft do return to earth so they can
654820	657140	bring back samples and experiments.
657140	661740	Once ready, the spacecraft will undock and slowly drift away from the ISS until it disappears
661740	667220	from view and at that point, the ISS is ready for another delivery of humans or cargo—one
667220	671820	of the most unique regular deliveries in our universe.
671820	675180	Rocket science is something that always seems out of reach for mere mortals.
