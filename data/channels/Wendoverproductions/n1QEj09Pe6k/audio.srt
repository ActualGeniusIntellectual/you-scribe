00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Audible.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,800
So I recently went down the rabbit hole of looking at old flight schedules.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,300
Airlines used to publish these physical brochures with their fares and flight times and when

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,460
looking at this American Airlines one from 1967 I noticed something interesting.

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:25,360
The flight between New York and LA was scheduled as 5 hours and 43 minutes long.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,040
That didn't seem right.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,200
American flight 3 was scheduled to leave JFK airport every day at 12 noon and arrive

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,480
at LAX at 2.43 pm.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,880
There's 3 hours time difference.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,200
It turns out that nowadays American Airlines flight 3 still leaves JFK daily at noon, but

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,000
the difference is that today, flight 3 is scheduled to arrive at LAX at 3.27 pm—44

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,680
minutes later than in 1967.

13
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,020
This has happened across the board.

14
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,400
Almost every flight today takes longer than it did back in the 60's.

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,720
In general the actual flight times—the time in the air—is the same, but with all the

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,420
congestion and delays at airports the scheduled times now account for things going wrong.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,900
What this means though is that, overall, flying has slowed down.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,740
In 1967 we hadn't been to the moon and computers looked like this, but we were flying everywhere

19
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,340
just as fast or even faster than we do today.

20
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,700
What happened that caused this immense lack of progress in the last 50 years?

21
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,540
There are three main types of aircraft engine—the turboprop, turbofan, and turbojet—and each

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,100
of them has a range of speeds when they're most efficient.

23
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,660
The turboprop is the kind of engine that you see on most propeller aircraft.

24
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:45,420
Almost all of the thrust with turboprop engines comes from the propeller.

25
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,060
The turbine, which spins the propeller, does intake and speed up some air, but the exhaust

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,260
air is not at a very high speed so it only accounts for less than 10% of the overall

27
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,260
thrust.

28
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,940
These engines are generally inexpensive both to buy and operate so a lot of smaller commuter

29
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,380
planes use turboprop engines.

30
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,940
Of course there's a trade-off—they're not as fast.

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:12,280
They're most efficient between about 325 and 375 miles per hour.

32
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,700
Any faster than that and it's better to use a turbofan.

33
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,860
Now these are the engines that you see everywhere.

34
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,220
First every commercial aircraft is turbofan driven.

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,300
With turbofans, the air is initially sped up by a fan—that's what you see when you

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,340
look at the engine from the front.

37
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,520
Then some of the air goes into the internal combustion chamber where the actual turbine

38
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,220
that drives the fan is and the rest of it goes around the turbine.

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,580
While air that bypasses the turbine is also sped up, the majority of the thrust comes

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,580
from the air that passes through the turbine.

41
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,100
Turbofans are most efficient at the speeds that you see most aircraft fly today—400

42
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,180
to 620 miles per hour.

43
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:57,040
If you want to go supersonic—above 767 miles per hour—you need a turbojet.

44
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,740
Turbojets are very similar to turbofans except all the air goes through the turbine—no

45
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,140
air is bypassed.

46
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,420
This lets them achieve extremely high speeds, but they also require an immense amount of

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,420
fuel.

48
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,540
Engines are only really efficient between about 1,300 and 1,400 miles per hour.

49
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,260
What really determines the efficiency of engines is something called the bypass ratio.

50
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,260
That's the ratio of the amount of air that passes through the bypass duct to the amount

51
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,300
that passes through the engine core.

52
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,220
The thing is, it really doesn't take that much more energy to spin a larger fan.

53
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:35,540
What requires a lot more fuel is to put more air through the engine core.

54
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,340
That means that engines that accelerate more air through the bypass duct can get more thrust

55
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,180
for the same amount of energy.

56
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,740
So, as a rule, the higher the bypass ratio, the more efficient the engine.

57
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,580
Take a look at this General Electric GenX engine.

58
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,700
This is a relatively new, super-efficient engine used on both the 787 Dreamliner and

59
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,540
the 747-8i.

60
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,500
You can see that the fan is much larger than the turbine itself.

61
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,620
That's because this engine has a bypass ratio of 10 to 1.

62
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,060
Ten times more air goes around the turbine than through it.

63
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,700
Compare that to the CFM International CFM56—an older and less efficient engine.

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,000
You can see there's much less fan relative to the turbine so this engine only has a bypass

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,460
ratio of 5.9 to 1, but that's still considered to be high.

66
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,900
The difference is most striking when comparing either of those engines to the Pratt & Whitney

67
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,260
JT8D.

68
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:36,220
This engine has a bypass ratio of only .96 to 1 so it's astoundingly inefficient but

69
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,220
it's still significantly more efficient than the Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus 593.

70
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,320
This engine is a turbojet.

71
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,780
As I mentioned, these drive all the air the fan picks up through the turbine and that

72
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,380
means that no air is bypassed.

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:58,500
Therefore, it has a bypass ratio of 0 to 1 and is what's known as a zero-bypass engine.

74
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,800
Since 100% of the air passing through the engine goes through the turbine, the fuel

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:10,080
consumption is significantly higher than that of the Gen X, CFM56, or even the JT8D.

76
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,300
The Concorde, using the zero-bypass Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus 593, burned 46.85 pounds of

77
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,020
fuel per mile flown while the 787 Dreamliner, using the 10 to 1 bypass ratio General Electric

78
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:27,480
Gen X, uses 18.7 pounds per mile.

79
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,000
But the Concorde was a tiny airplane even compared to the modestly sized 787.

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,200
It seated only 100 passengers compared to 291 on the Dreamliner.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,100
That means that the per person fuel economy on the Concorde was just about 14 miles per

82
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,400
gallon compared to 104 miles per gallon on the Dreamliner.

83
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,080
In the end, Air France and British Airways, the only two Concorde operators, could not

84
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,320
afford to keep flying the plane.

85
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,040
Less than one third of the seats were actually occupied by paying customers.

86
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,460
Others were filled by those using miles or those upgraded from first class on normal

87
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,460
flights.

88
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,200
After all, it cost at a minimum $7,500 of today's dollars to fly one way from London

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:18,120
to New York in those three hours and that was to fly in seats that looked like this—not

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,200
all that different than the economy seats of today.

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,840
When the Concorde started flying, first class on other planes looked like this.

92
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,560
While nice, these seats were just larger economy class seats and it wasn't incredibly easy

93
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,800
to sleep in them.

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,200
By the time the Concorde stopped flying in 2003, first class looked like this and the

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,640
seats went fully flat into a bed.

96
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,640
Many chose to spend a little less to pass seven hours in this rather than spending three

97
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,120
hours in these cramped seats.

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,920
British Airways even introduced the first fully flat business class seat in 2000 so

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:57,020
for significantly less money than the Concorde, travelers could cross the Atlantic sleeping

100
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,200
horizontally.

101
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,640
This just wasn't luxury anymore.

102
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,480
The whole idea of the Concorde was to create the most efficient way to cross the Atlantic

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,040
for the business traveler, but with fully flat beds, those traveling towards Europe

104
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,460
could leave the US in the evening, get their night's sleep on the plane, and wake up

105
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,500
in Europe—essentially wasting no time.

106
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,900
No longer luxurious or efficient, the Concorde flew its final commercial flight on October

107
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:28,420
24th, 2003 thereby ending the era of commercial supersonic flight.

108
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,960
Here's the thing about flying—speed really doesn't matter to airlines.

109
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,020
It really only exists as a selling point for the consumer.

110
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,840
The cost of the airplane is a relatively small part of the overall cost to fly so you'll

111
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,780
never see an airline fly faster so they can use their planes more.

112
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:50,080
Planes lifespans are generally rated in cycles—the number of times the plane takes off and lands.

113
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,000
The Dreamliner is rated for 44,000 cycles and has a list price, which is often much

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,040
higher than the actual sale price, of $224.6 million.

115
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,260
That means that the cost of the airplane per flight is barely over $5,000 while the fuel

116
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:09,760
cost for a flight from New York to London is well over $15,000.

117
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,280
Therefore, airlines always just fly their airplanes at the most fuel-efficient speed.

118
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,240
It turns out that that speed is just about always between 500 and 550 miles per hour.

119
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,440
What's weird about this is that it's well below the speed of sound—767 miles per hour.

120
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,400
Why don't planes fly just below the speed of sound?

121
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,520
Well, this graph shows the drag on airplanes at different speeds.

122
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,420
Between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 is what's known as the transonic range.

123
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:44,820
At these speeds, the airflow around an airplane is not fully subsonic or supersonic.

124
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,660
Essentially, some air is subsonic and some is supersonic.

125
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,740
So beginning at Mach 0.8, some airflow becomes supersonic which increases drag exponentially

126
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,460
and destabilizes the aircraft so it's actually quite dangerous to fly right around the speed

127
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,480
of sound.

128
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,140
You either have to fly well above or below.

129
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,420
You can actually see when an airplane is flying transonic.

130
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,020
It's hard to see, but there are these lines that look like scratches on the camera lens

131
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,500
but are actually mini supersonic shockwaves.

132
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,060
Because of the disturbances in the airflow, flying between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 actually

133
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,500
requires more fuel than flying above Mach 1.2 so that's why we have this number—613.8

134
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,500
miles per hour.

135
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,580
That's the speed limit for commercially viable subsonic jets.

136
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,260
While supersonic flight and crossing the Atlantic in three hours is flashy and exciting,

137
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,320
what's truly impressive is hopping the pond for $100 or $200 on an airline that's actually

138
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,320
making a profit and that's becoming more of a reality today.

139
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:53,540
With current speeds, airplanes are able to fly anywhere on earth in 24 hours and that's

140
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,720
fast enough for almost everyone.

141
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,700
The barrier to travel for most people is cost, not speed, so manufacturers and airlines will

142
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:07,020
continue to focus their efforts on driving down the cost of travel, not the time.

143
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,520
In the end, time is the enemy of the privileged few.

144
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,780
Cost is the enemy of the masses.

145
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,340
This video was made possible by Audible.

146
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,480
Audible is the leading online audiobook provider, but I'm sure you already know that.

147
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,260
What I'll tell you is how I use Audible.

148
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,140
I love reading, but there are a lot of times when I just can't read a paper book—when

149
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,920
working out, doing dishes, even when editing a video.

150
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,600
So I download tons of audiobooks through Audible so I can learn no matter what I'm doing.

151
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,960
If you listen when doing tasks, like me, you're turning what is normally something boring

152
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,320
into something fun.

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,860
I recently started listening to Skyfaring, a book by 747 pilot Mark van Hunacker.

154
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,200
It gives a glimpse into the pilot side of flying, but it's written much more like

155
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,460
a novel or memoir than a heavy duty non-fiction book.

156
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,300
The great thing is that you can listen to this book for free thanks to Audible with

157
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,620
a 30 day free trial you get by signing up using the link audible.com slash wendover.

158
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,700
