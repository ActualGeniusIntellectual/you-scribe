00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Audible.

00:05.360 --> 00:09.800
So I recently went down the rabbit hole of looking at old flight schedules.

00:09.800 --> 00:14.300
Airlines used to publish these physical brochures with their fares and flight times and when

00:14.300 --> 00:19.460
looking at this American Airlines one from 1967 I noticed something interesting.

00:19.460 --> 00:25.360
The flight between New York and LA was scheduled as 5 hours and 43 minutes long.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.040
That didn't seem right.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.200
American flight 3 was scheduled to leave JFK airport every day at 12 noon and arrive

00:31.200 --> 00:33.480
at LAX at 2.43 pm.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.880
There's 3 hours time difference.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.200
It turns out that nowadays American Airlines flight 3 still leaves JFK daily at noon, but

00:41.200 --> 00:48.000
the difference is that today, flight 3 is scheduled to arrive at LAX at 3.27 pm—44

00:48.000 --> 00:50.680
minutes later than in 1967.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.020
This has happened across the board.

00:53.020 --> 00:57.400
Almost every flight today takes longer than it did back in the 60's.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.720
In general the actual flight times—the time in the air—is the same, but with all the

01:01.720 --> 01:07.420
congestion and delays at airports the scheduled times now account for things going wrong.

01:07.420 --> 01:11.900
What this means though is that, overall, flying has slowed down.

01:11.900 --> 01:17.740
In 1967 we hadn't been to the moon and computers looked like this, but we were flying everywhere

01:17.740 --> 01:21.340
just as fast or even faster than we do today.

01:21.340 --> 01:26.700
What happened that caused this immense lack of progress in the last 50 years?

01:26.700 --> 01:33.540
There are three main types of aircraft engine—the turboprop, turbofan, and turbojet—and each

01:33.540 --> 01:37.100
of them has a range of speeds when they're most efficient.

01:37.100 --> 01:41.660
The turboprop is the kind of engine that you see on most propeller aircraft.

01:41.660 --> 01:45.420
Almost all of the thrust with turboprop engines comes from the propeller.

01:45.420 --> 01:50.060
The turbine, which spins the propeller, does intake and speed up some air, but the exhaust

01:50.060 --> 01:55.260
air is not at a very high speed so it only accounts for less than 10% of the overall

01:55.260 --> 01:56.260
thrust.

01:56.260 --> 02:00.940
These engines are generally inexpensive both to buy and operate so a lot of smaller commuter

02:00.940 --> 02:03.380
planes use turboprop engines.

02:03.380 --> 02:05.940
Of course there's a trade-off—they're not as fast.

02:05.940 --> 02:12.280
They're most efficient between about 325 and 375 miles per hour.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.700
Any faster than that and it's better to use a turbofan.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.860
Now these are the engines that you see everywhere.

02:18.860 --> 02:22.220
First every commercial aircraft is turbofan driven.

02:22.220 --> 02:26.300
With turbofans, the air is initially sped up by a fan—that's what you see when you

02:26.300 --> 02:28.340
look at the engine from the front.

02:28.340 --> 02:32.520
Then some of the air goes into the internal combustion chamber where the actual turbine

02:32.520 --> 02:36.220
that drives the fan is and the rest of it goes around the turbine.

02:36.220 --> 02:40.580
While air that bypasses the turbine is also sped up, the majority of the thrust comes

02:40.580 --> 02:43.580
from the air that passes through the turbine.

02:43.580 --> 02:48.100
Turbofans are most efficient at the speeds that you see most aircraft fly today—400

02:48.100 --> 02:50.180
to 620 miles per hour.

02:50.180 --> 02:57.040
If you want to go supersonic—above 767 miles per hour—you need a turbojet.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.740
Turbojets are very similar to turbofans except all the air goes through the turbine—no

03:01.740 --> 03:03.140
air is bypassed.

03:03.140 --> 03:08.420
This lets them achieve extremely high speeds, but they also require an immense amount of

03:08.420 --> 03:09.420
fuel.

03:09.700 --> 03:14.540
Engines are only really efficient between about 1,300 and 1,400 miles per hour.

03:14.540 --> 03:19.260
What really determines the efficiency of engines is something called the bypass ratio.

03:19.260 --> 03:24.260
That's the ratio of the amount of air that passes through the bypass duct to the amount

03:24.260 --> 03:26.300
that passes through the engine core.

03:26.300 --> 03:31.220
The thing is, it really doesn't take that much more energy to spin a larger fan.

03:31.220 --> 03:35.540
What requires a lot more fuel is to put more air through the engine core.

03:35.540 --> 03:40.340
That means that engines that accelerate more air through the bypass duct can get more thrust

03:40.340 --> 03:42.180
for the same amount of energy.

03:42.180 --> 03:47.740
So, as a rule, the higher the bypass ratio, the more efficient the engine.

03:47.740 --> 03:50.580
Take a look at this General Electric GenX engine.

03:50.580 --> 03:55.700
This is a relatively new, super-efficient engine used on both the 787 Dreamliner and

03:55.700 --> 03:57.540
the 747-8i.

03:57.540 --> 04:01.500
You can see that the fan is much larger than the turbine itself.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.620
That's because this engine has a bypass ratio of 10 to 1.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.060
Ten times more air goes around the turbine than through it.

04:09.060 --> 04:14.700
Compare that to the CFM International CFM56—an older and less efficient engine.

04:14.700 --> 04:20.000
You can see there's much less fan relative to the turbine so this engine only has a bypass

04:20.000 --> 04:24.460
ratio of 5.9 to 1, but that's still considered to be high.

04:24.460 --> 04:28.900
The difference is most striking when comparing either of those engines to the Pratt & Whitney

04:28.900 --> 04:30.260
JT8D.

04:30.260 --> 04:36.220
This engine has a bypass ratio of only .96 to 1 so it's astoundingly inefficient but

04:36.220 --> 04:42.220
it's still significantly more efficient than the Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus 593.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.320
This engine is a turbojet.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.780
As I mentioned, these drive all the air the fan picks up through the turbine and that

04:48.780 --> 04:51.380
means that no air is bypassed.

04:51.380 --> 04:58.500
Therefore, it has a bypass ratio of 0 to 1 and is what's known as a zero-bypass engine.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.800
Since 100% of the air passing through the engine goes through the turbine, the fuel

05:02.800 --> 05:10.080
consumption is significantly higher than that of the Gen X, CFM56, or even the JT8D.

05:10.080 --> 05:17.300
The Concorde, using the zero-bypass Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus 593, burned 46.85 pounds of

05:17.300 --> 05:24.020
fuel per mile flown while the 787 Dreamliner, using the 10 to 1 bypass ratio General Electric

05:24.020 --> 05:27.480
Gen X, uses 18.7 pounds per mile.

05:27.480 --> 05:33.000
But the Concorde was a tiny airplane even compared to the modestly sized 787.

05:33.000 --> 05:39.200
It seated only 100 passengers compared to 291 on the Dreamliner.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.100
That means that the per person fuel economy on the Concorde was just about 14 miles per

05:44.100 --> 05:48.400
gallon compared to 104 miles per gallon on the Dreamliner.

05:48.400 --> 05:53.080
In the end, Air France and British Airways, the only two Concorde operators, could not

05:53.080 --> 05:55.320
afford to keep flying the plane.

05:55.320 --> 06:00.040
Less than one third of the seats were actually occupied by paying customers.

06:00.040 --> 06:04.460
Others were filled by those using miles or those upgraded from first class on normal

06:04.460 --> 06:05.460
flights.

06:05.460 --> 06:12.200
After all, it cost at a minimum $7,500 of today's dollars to fly one way from London

06:12.200 --> 06:18.120
to New York in those three hours and that was to fly in seats that looked like this—not

06:18.120 --> 06:21.200
all that different than the economy seats of today.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.840
When the Concorde started flying, first class on other planes looked like this.

06:25.840 --> 06:30.560
While nice, these seats were just larger economy class seats and it wasn't incredibly easy

06:30.560 --> 06:31.800
to sleep in them.

06:31.800 --> 06:37.200
By the time the Concorde stopped flying in 2003, first class looked like this and the

06:37.200 --> 06:39.640
seats went fully flat into a bed.

06:39.640 --> 06:44.640
Many chose to spend a little less to pass seven hours in this rather than spending three

06:44.640 --> 06:47.120
hours in these cramped seats.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.920
British Airways even introduced the first fully flat business class seat in 2000 so

06:51.920 --> 06:57.020
for significantly less money than the Concorde, travelers could cross the Atlantic sleeping

06:57.020 --> 06:58.200
horizontally.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.640
This just wasn't luxury anymore.

07:00.640 --> 07:05.480
The whole idea of the Concorde was to create the most efficient way to cross the Atlantic

07:05.480 --> 07:10.040
for the business traveler, but with fully flat beds, those traveling towards Europe

07:10.040 --> 07:14.460
could leave the US in the evening, get their night's sleep on the plane, and wake up

07:14.460 --> 07:17.500
in Europe—essentially wasting no time.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.900
No longer luxurious or efficient, the Concorde flew its final commercial flight on October

07:22.900 --> 07:28.420
24th, 2003 thereby ending the era of commercial supersonic flight.

07:28.420 --> 07:32.960
Here's the thing about flying—speed really doesn't matter to airlines.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.020
It really only exists as a selling point for the consumer.

07:36.020 --> 07:40.840
The cost of the airplane is a relatively small part of the overall cost to fly so you'll

07:40.840 --> 07:44.780
never see an airline fly faster so they can use their planes more.

07:44.780 --> 07:50.080
Planes lifespans are generally rated in cycles—the number of times the plane takes off and lands.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.000
The Dreamliner is rated for 44,000 cycles and has a list price, which is often much

07:55.000 --> 08:00.040
higher than the actual sale price, of $224.6 million.

08:00.040 --> 08:05.260
That means that the cost of the airplane per flight is barely over $5,000 while the fuel

08:05.260 --> 08:09.760
cost for a flight from New York to London is well over $15,000.

08:09.760 --> 08:15.280
Therefore, airlines always just fly their airplanes at the most fuel-efficient speed.

08:15.280 --> 08:21.240
It turns out that that speed is just about always between 500 and 550 miles per hour.

08:21.240 --> 08:27.440
What's weird about this is that it's well below the speed of sound—767 miles per hour.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.400
Why don't planes fly just below the speed of sound?

08:30.400 --> 08:34.520
Well, this graph shows the drag on airplanes at different speeds.

08:34.520 --> 08:39.420
Between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 is what's known as the transonic range.

08:39.420 --> 08:44.820
At these speeds, the airflow around an airplane is not fully subsonic or supersonic.

08:44.820 --> 08:48.660
Essentially, some air is subsonic and some is supersonic.

08:48.660 --> 08:54.740
So beginning at Mach 0.8, some airflow becomes supersonic which increases drag exponentially

08:54.740 --> 08:59.460
and destabilizes the aircraft so it's actually quite dangerous to fly right around the speed

08:59.460 --> 09:00.480
of sound.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.140
You either have to fly well above or below.

09:03.140 --> 09:06.420
You can actually see when an airplane is flying transonic.

09:06.420 --> 09:11.020
It's hard to see, but there are these lines that look like scratches on the camera lens

09:11.020 --> 09:14.500
but are actually mini supersonic shockwaves.

09:14.500 --> 09:20.060
Because of the disturbances in the airflow, flying between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 actually

09:20.060 --> 09:27.500
requires more fuel than flying above Mach 1.2 so that's why we have this number—613.8

09:27.500 --> 09:28.500
miles per hour.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.580
That's the speed limit for commercially viable subsonic jets.

09:32.580 --> 09:37.260
While supersonic flight and crossing the Atlantic in three hours is flashy and exciting,

09:37.260 --> 09:43.320
what's truly impressive is hopping the pond for $100 or $200 on an airline that's actually

09:43.320 --> 09:47.320
making a profit and that's becoming more of a reality today.

09:47.320 --> 09:53.540
With current speeds, airplanes are able to fly anywhere on earth in 24 hours and that's

09:53.540 --> 09:55.720
fast enough for almost everyone.

09:55.720 --> 10:01.700
The barrier to travel for most people is cost, not speed, so manufacturers and airlines will

10:01.700 --> 10:07.020
continue to focus their efforts on driving down the cost of travel, not the time.

10:07.020 --> 10:10.520
In the end, time is the enemy of the privileged few.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.780
Cost is the enemy of the masses.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.340
This video was made possible by Audible.

10:16.340 --> 10:20.480
Audible is the leading online audiobook provider, but I'm sure you already know that.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.260
What I'll tell you is how I use Audible.

10:22.260 --> 10:26.140
I love reading, but there are a lot of times when I just can't read a paper book—when

10:26.140 --> 10:28.920
working out, doing dishes, even when editing a video.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.600
So I download tons of audiobooks through Audible so I can learn no matter what I'm doing.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.960
If you listen when doing tasks, like me, you're turning what is normally something boring

10:37.960 --> 10:39.320
into something fun.

10:39.320 --> 10:44.860
I recently started listening to Skyfaring, a book by 747 pilot Mark van Hunacker.

10:44.860 --> 10:48.200
It gives a glimpse into the pilot side of flying, but it's written much more like

10:48.200 --> 10:51.460
a novel or memoir than a heavy duty non-fiction book.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.300
The great thing is that you can listen to this book for free thanks to Audible with
