0	5360	This is a Wendover Productions video made possible by Audible.
5360	9800	So I recently went down the rabbit hole of looking at old flight schedules.
9800	14300	Airlines used to publish these physical brochures with their fares and flight times and when
14300	19460	looking at this American Airlines one from 1967 I noticed something interesting.
19460	25360	The flight between New York and LA was scheduled as 5 hours and 43 minutes long.
25360	27040	That didn't seem right.
27040	31200	American flight 3 was scheduled to leave JFK airport every day at 12 noon and arrive
31200	33480	at LAX at 2.43 pm.
33480	35880	There's 3 hours time difference.
35880	41200	It turns out that nowadays American Airlines flight 3 still leaves JFK daily at noon, but
41200	48000	the difference is that today, flight 3 is scheduled to arrive at LAX at 3.27 pm—44
48000	50680	minutes later than in 1967.
50680	53020	This has happened across the board.
53020	57400	Almost every flight today takes longer than it did back in the 60's.
57400	61720	In general the actual flight times—the time in the air—is the same, but with all the
61720	67420	congestion and delays at airports the scheduled times now account for things going wrong.
67420	71900	What this means though is that, overall, flying has slowed down.
71900	77740	In 1967 we hadn't been to the moon and computers looked like this, but we were flying everywhere
77740	81340	just as fast or even faster than we do today.
81340	86700	What happened that caused this immense lack of progress in the last 50 years?
86700	93540	There are three main types of aircraft engine—the turboprop, turbofan, and turbojet—and each
93540	97100	of them has a range of speeds when they're most efficient.
97100	101660	The turboprop is the kind of engine that you see on most propeller aircraft.
101660	105420	Almost all of the thrust with turboprop engines comes from the propeller.
105420	110060	The turbine, which spins the propeller, does intake and speed up some air, but the exhaust
110060	115260	air is not at a very high speed so it only accounts for less than 10% of the overall
115260	116260	thrust.
116260	120940	These engines are generally inexpensive both to buy and operate so a lot of smaller commuter
120940	123380	planes use turboprop engines.
123380	125940	Of course there's a trade-off—they're not as fast.
125940	132280	They're most efficient between about 325 and 375 miles per hour.
132280	135700	Any faster than that and it's better to use a turbofan.
135700	138860	Now these are the engines that you see everywhere.
138860	142220	First every commercial aircraft is turbofan driven.
142220	146300	With turbofans, the air is initially sped up by a fan—that's what you see when you
146300	148340	look at the engine from the front.
148340	152520	Then some of the air goes into the internal combustion chamber where the actual turbine
152520	156220	that drives the fan is and the rest of it goes around the turbine.
156220	160580	While air that bypasses the turbine is also sped up, the majority of the thrust comes
160580	163580	from the air that passes through the turbine.
163580	168100	Turbofans are most efficient at the speeds that you see most aircraft fly today—400
168100	170180	to 620 miles per hour.
170180	177040	If you want to go supersonic—above 767 miles per hour—you need a turbojet.
177040	181740	Turbojets are very similar to turbofans except all the air goes through the turbine—no
181740	183140	air is bypassed.
183140	188420	This lets them achieve extremely high speeds, but they also require an immense amount of
188420	189420	fuel.
189700	194540	Engines are only really efficient between about 1,300 and 1,400 miles per hour.
194540	199260	What really determines the efficiency of engines is something called the bypass ratio.
199260	204260	That's the ratio of the amount of air that passes through the bypass duct to the amount
204260	206300	that passes through the engine core.
206300	211220	The thing is, it really doesn't take that much more energy to spin a larger fan.
211220	215540	What requires a lot more fuel is to put more air through the engine core.
215540	220340	That means that engines that accelerate more air through the bypass duct can get more thrust
220340	222180	for the same amount of energy.
222180	227740	So, as a rule, the higher the bypass ratio, the more efficient the engine.
227740	230580	Take a look at this General Electric GenX engine.
230580	235700	This is a relatively new, super-efficient engine used on both the 787 Dreamliner and
235700	237540	the 747-8i.
237540	241500	You can see that the fan is much larger than the turbine itself.
241500	245620	That's because this engine has a bypass ratio of 10 to 1.
245620	249060	Ten times more air goes around the turbine than through it.
249060	254700	Compare that to the CFM International CFM56—an older and less efficient engine.
254700	260000	You can see there's much less fan relative to the turbine so this engine only has a bypass
260000	264460	ratio of 5.9 to 1, but that's still considered to be high.
264460	268900	The difference is most striking when comparing either of those engines to the Pratt & Whitney
268900	270260	JT8D.
270260	276220	This engine has a bypass ratio of only .96 to 1 so it's astoundingly inefficient but
276220	282220	it's still significantly more efficient than the Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus 593.
282220	284320	This engine is a turbojet.
284320	288780	As I mentioned, these drive all the air the fan picks up through the turbine and that
288780	291380	means that no air is bypassed.
291380	298500	Therefore, it has a bypass ratio of 0 to 1 and is what's known as a zero-bypass engine.
298500	302800	Since 100% of the air passing through the engine goes through the turbine, the fuel
302800	310080	consumption is significantly higher than that of the Gen X, CFM56, or even the JT8D.
310080	317300	The Concorde, using the zero-bypass Rolls-Royce Snecma Olympus 593, burned 46.85 pounds of
317300	324020	fuel per mile flown while the 787 Dreamliner, using the 10 to 1 bypass ratio General Electric
324020	327480	Gen X, uses 18.7 pounds per mile.
327480	333000	But the Concorde was a tiny airplane even compared to the modestly sized 787.
333000	339200	It seated only 100 passengers compared to 291 on the Dreamliner.
339200	344100	That means that the per person fuel economy on the Concorde was just about 14 miles per
344100	348400	gallon compared to 104 miles per gallon on the Dreamliner.
348400	353080	In the end, Air France and British Airways, the only two Concorde operators, could not
353080	355320	afford to keep flying the plane.
355320	360040	Less than one third of the seats were actually occupied by paying customers.
360040	364460	Others were filled by those using miles or those upgraded from first class on normal
364460	365460	flights.
365460	372200	After all, it cost at a minimum $7,500 of today's dollars to fly one way from London
372200	378120	to New York in those three hours and that was to fly in seats that looked like this—not
378120	381200	all that different than the economy seats of today.
381200	385840	When the Concorde started flying, first class on other planes looked like this.
385840	390560	While nice, these seats were just larger economy class seats and it wasn't incredibly easy
390560	391800	to sleep in them.
391800	397200	By the time the Concorde stopped flying in 2003, first class looked like this and the
397200	399640	seats went fully flat into a bed.
399640	404640	Many chose to spend a little less to pass seven hours in this rather than spending three
404640	407120	hours in these cramped seats.
407120	411920	British Airways even introduced the first fully flat business class seat in 2000 so
411920	417020	for significantly less money than the Concorde, travelers could cross the Atlantic sleeping
417020	418200	horizontally.
418200	420640	This just wasn't luxury anymore.
420640	425480	The whole idea of the Concorde was to create the most efficient way to cross the Atlantic
425480	430040	for the business traveler, but with fully flat beds, those traveling towards Europe
430040	434460	could leave the US in the evening, get their night's sleep on the plane, and wake up
434460	437500	in Europe—essentially wasting no time.
437500	442900	No longer luxurious or efficient, the Concorde flew its final commercial flight on October
442900	448420	24th, 2003 thereby ending the era of commercial supersonic flight.
448420	452960	Here's the thing about flying—speed really doesn't matter to airlines.
452960	456020	It really only exists as a selling point for the consumer.
456020	460840	The cost of the airplane is a relatively small part of the overall cost to fly so you'll
460840	464780	never see an airline fly faster so they can use their planes more.
464780	470080	Planes lifespans are generally rated in cycles—the number of times the plane takes off and lands.
470080	475000	The Dreamliner is rated for 44,000 cycles and has a list price, which is often much
475000	480040	higher than the actual sale price, of $224.6 million.
480040	485260	That means that the cost of the airplane per flight is barely over $5,000 while the fuel
485260	489760	cost for a flight from New York to London is well over $15,000.
489760	495280	Therefore, airlines always just fly their airplanes at the most fuel-efficient speed.
495280	501240	It turns out that that speed is just about always between 500 and 550 miles per hour.
501240	507440	What's weird about this is that it's well below the speed of sound—767 miles per hour.
507440	510400	Why don't planes fly just below the speed of sound?
510400	514520	Well, this graph shows the drag on airplanes at different speeds.
514520	519420	Between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 is what's known as the transonic range.
519420	524820	At these speeds, the airflow around an airplane is not fully subsonic or supersonic.
524820	528660	Essentially, some air is subsonic and some is supersonic.
528660	534740	So beginning at Mach 0.8, some airflow becomes supersonic which increases drag exponentially
534740	539460	and destabilizes the aircraft so it's actually quite dangerous to fly right around the speed
539460	540480	of sound.
540480	543140	You either have to fly well above or below.
543140	546420	You can actually see when an airplane is flying transonic.
546420	551020	It's hard to see, but there are these lines that look like scratches on the camera lens
551020	554500	but are actually mini supersonic shockwaves.
554500	560060	Because of the disturbances in the airflow, flying between Mach 0.8 and Mach 1.2 actually
560060	567500	requires more fuel than flying above Mach 1.2 so that's why we have this number—613.8
567500	568500	miles per hour.
568500	572580	That's the speed limit for commercially viable subsonic jets.
572580	577260	While supersonic flight and crossing the Atlantic in three hours is flashy and exciting,
577260	583320	what's truly impressive is hopping the pond for $100 or $200 on an airline that's actually
583320	587320	making a profit and that's becoming more of a reality today.
587320	593540	With current speeds, airplanes are able to fly anywhere on earth in 24 hours and that's
593540	595720	fast enough for almost everyone.
595720	601700	The barrier to travel for most people is cost, not speed, so manufacturers and airlines will
601700	607020	continue to focus their efforts on driving down the cost of travel, not the time.
607020	610520	In the end, time is the enemy of the privileged few.
610520	613780	Cost is the enemy of the masses.
613780	616340	This video was made possible by Audible.
616340	620480	Audible is the leading online audiobook provider, but I'm sure you already know that.
620480	622260	What I'll tell you is how I use Audible.
622260	626140	I love reading, but there are a lot of times when I just can't read a paper book—when
626140	628920	working out, doing dishes, even when editing a video.
628920	633600	So I download tons of audiobooks through Audible so I can learn no matter what I'm doing.
633600	637960	If you listen when doing tasks, like me, you're turning what is normally something boring
637960	639320	into something fun.
639320	644860	I recently started listening to Skyfaring, a book by 747 pilot Mark van Hunacker.
644860	648200	It gives a glimpse into the pilot side of flying, but it's written much more like
648200	651460	a novel or memoir than a heavy duty non-fiction book.
651460	655300	The great thing is that you can listen to this book for free thanks to Audible with
655300	660620	a 30 day free trial you get by signing up using the link audible.com slash wendover.
