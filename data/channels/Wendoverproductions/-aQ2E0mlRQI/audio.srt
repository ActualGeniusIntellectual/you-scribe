1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
If you've ever looked at a flight tracker sometime around 10 or 11 pm eastern, you might

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,640
have noticed something—perfect lines of planes stretching all the way to Europe.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,320
These are just some of the over 2,000 daily flights that cross the northern Atlantic.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,080
With so many flights, there just has to be organization.

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,600
This is the most direct route from New York to London.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,360
You may think it's this—a straight line—but that straight line isn't actually a straight

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
line.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,760
This line is a straight line because, despite what some may think, the earth is curved.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,080
From New York to London the curve you see on a flat map isn't too extreme, but in

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,240
the case of a longer flight, such as from New York to Bangkok, the most direct route

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,960
is not this, but this—straight over the north pole.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,020
It makes a lot more sense if you look at a north pole oriented map.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,600
If you draw the most direct route between Atlanta and London, you'll see that it passes

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,560
over every major east coast international airport.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,620
That means that planes from Atlanta to Europe travel on the exact same route as planes from

16
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,780
Charlotte, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,580
All these transatlantic planes typically leave between 6 and 8 pm eastern to time their arrival

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,180
for early morning in Europe.

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,020
That means that there are potentially hundreds of planes all going the exact same route at

20
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,500
the exact same time.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,480
The north Atlantic also has something known as the jet stream.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,080
These easterly winds average around 110 miles per hour and if planes fly in them, they can

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,260
cut hours off their travel time.

24
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,620
However, the winds are only strongest in a line 3 miles high and 100 miles wide.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,680
That further concentrates the flights.

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,820
On average, an eastbound transatlantic flight from New York to London takes about 6 hours

27
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,180
and 15 minutes.

28
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,280
Coming back against the jet stream, the same flight takes over 7 hours.

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,340
Sometimes the winds can be even more active, such as on January 8th, 2015, when British

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:49,140
Airways flight 114 flew from New York to London in only 5 hours and 16 minutes—a new record

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,160
for a commercial subsonic plane.

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:56,220
On that day, the jet stream was blowing over 200 miles per hour and the Boeing 777 reached

33
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:02,500
a speed of 745 miles per hour—only 16 miles per hour below the sound barrier.

34
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,340
So when winds can cut an hour off a flight and a 777 burns 2,700 gallons of fuel per

35
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:14,020
hour and jet fuel costs $1.89 per gallon, that's a $5,103 difference between being

36
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,020
in the right and the wrong winds.

37
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,140
Hopefully you now see why this is important.

38
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,600
So there are all these planes that are flying the exact same route, but usually that's

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
no problem.

40
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,440
The busiest route in North America—New York to Chicago—sees over 100 flights per day,

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,300
leaving as frequently as every 5 minutes during the morning and evening rush, and these planes

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,160
just fly the most efficient route.

43
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,120
Before the flight, route planners file a plan with air traffic control and during the flight,

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,180
they're just directed by air traffic control in a way that keeps them 5 nautical miles

45
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,320
from other planes.

46
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,480
The difference between New York to Chicago and New York to London is that, over the North

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,660
Atlantic, there is no radar.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,680
You see, radar only extends about 250 miles offshore.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,860
Transatlantic planes can be more than 1,000 miles from shore.

50
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,600
That's why every morning, the route planners at Gander Air Traffic Control Center in Gander,

51
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,580
Newfoundland publish the day's North Atlantic tracks.

52
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,460
The night before, every airline that will fly across the Atlantic the following day

53
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:12,140
sends Gander a preferred route message indicating what they think the best route will be.

54
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,480
For the most part, Gander Center follows these requests and creates a set of 10 or so routes.

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,700
These tracks attempt to get the most amount of planes on the most efficient route to Europe.

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,540
The tracks are labeled—Zulu being the southernmost route, Yankee being the second southernmost,

57
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,440
then X-Ray, then Whiskey, and so on and so forth.

58
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,080
Here's how a flight on the tracks works, and I'll warn you, this is when the video

59
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
gets technical.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,500
Let's say we're going from New York to Paris.

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Around half an hour before scheduled departure, the captain talks to normal air traffic control

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,080
to request clearance for the route up to around Newfoundland, Canada.

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,600
In most cases, clearance is given, and soon after will take off.

64
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,680
About when the plane crosses the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the pilot will request the North

65
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,520
Atlantic track that he or she desires.

66
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,240
Here's today's message describing the day's routes over the Atlantic.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,780
After looking over this, the pilot decides to request track Whiskey.

68
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,580
That means that, at least for now, we'll head towards the Rafin Waypoint—our oceanic

69
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,680
entry point.

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,900
Waypoints are fixed spots that are used for flight navigation.

71
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,300
These are much easier for air traffic control to communicate to pilots than map coordinates

72
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,620
when speaking over radio.

73
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,940
Occasionally, you'll see some creatively named waypoints.

74
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,860
Just north of Lebanon, New Hampshire, there's Ham, Burger, and Fries.

75
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,660
On approach to Kansas City Airport, there's Spicy, Barbecue, Turkey, Smoke, Ribs.

76
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,860
Boston has two waypoints in support of their sports teams—the Cubs and Bears.

77
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,620
Some waypoint names are more somber.

78
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,660
On the northern approach route to Washington-Reagan National Airport, just miles away from where

79
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,580
a plane hit the Pentagon on 9-11, the waypoints read, We Will Never Forget, September 11th.

80
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,200
Since the North Atlantic tracks change every day, the modem just gives the entry and exit

81
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,920
waypoints and then coordinates for the route in between.

82
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,520
Since the track coordinates are pre-programmed into the autopilot before takeoff, there's

83
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,800
no reason to name them as waypoints since they won't be given over radio.

84
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,700
In the case of this flight, we're requesting track Whiskey and, more than likely, Gander

85
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,480
Control Center will give us permission, although sometimes they'll tell us to take a different

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,760
route, usually because we're closer to another plane than the minimum separation

87
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
distance.

88
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,600
Since it's much more difficult to know where planes are over the North Atlantic, they're

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,440
required to be 15 minutes separated—about 140 miles, rather than the normal 5 miles

90
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,400
in areas with radar coverage.

91
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,160
Assuming we're granted clearance, we'll head towards the RAF and waypoint and make

92
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,700
sure that our satellite communication systems are working.

93
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,140
Then we'll check to see if our high frequency radio is working—a backup in case other

94
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,960
communications go down.

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,260
Minutes later, just after passing RAF and waypoint, the controller will say, Radar service

96
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,420
is terminated.

97
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
Have a good night.

98
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,420
And, we're on our own.

99
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,960
All the North Atlantic tracks are preloaded onto autopilot, so there's really nothing

100
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,740
to do except wait.

101
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,580
When we hit 30 degrees west, we'll enter the Shandwick airspace approaching Western

102
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,580
Europe.

103
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,780
We switch our radios to Shandwick's frequency and fly a few more hours to our oceanic exit

104
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:53,060
point—Gunzo Waypoint—meaning we've successfully traversed the Northern Atlantic.

105
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,620
