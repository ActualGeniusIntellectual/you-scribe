0	4480	If you've ever looked at a flight tracker sometime around 10 or 11 pm eastern, you might
4480	9640	have noticed something—perfect lines of planes stretching all the way to Europe.
9640	14320	These are just some of the over 2,000 daily flights that cross the northern Atlantic.
14320	18080	With so many flights, there just has to be organization.
18080	20600	This is the most direct route from New York to London.
20600	25360	You may think it's this—a straight line—but that straight line isn't actually a straight
25360	26360	line.
26360	30760	This line is a straight line because, despite what some may think, the earth is curved.
30760	34080	From New York to London the curve you see on a flat map isn't too extreme, but in
34080	38240	the case of a longer flight, such as from New York to Bangkok, the most direct route
38240	41960	is not this, but this—straight over the north pole.
41960	45020	It makes a lot more sense if you look at a north pole oriented map.
45020	48600	If you draw the most direct route between Atlanta and London, you'll see that it passes
48600	51560	over every major east coast international airport.
51560	55620	That means that planes from Atlanta to Europe travel on the exact same route as planes from
55620	59780	Charlotte, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.
59780	64580	All these transatlantic planes typically leave between 6 and 8 pm eastern to time their arrival
64580	66180	for early morning in Europe.
66180	70020	That means that there are potentially hundreds of planes all going the exact same route at
70020	71500	the exact same time.
71500	74480	The north Atlantic also has something known as the jet stream.
74480	79080	These easterly winds average around 110 miles per hour and if planes fly in them, they can
79080	81260	cut hours off their travel time.
81260	86620	However, the winds are only strongest in a line 3 miles high and 100 miles wide.
86620	88680	That further concentrates the flights.
88680	92820	On average, an eastbound transatlantic flight from New York to London takes about 6 hours
92820	94180	and 15 minutes.
94180	98280	Coming back against the jet stream, the same flight takes over 7 hours.
98280	103340	Sometimes the winds can be even more active, such as on January 8th, 2015, when British
103340	109140	Airways flight 114 flew from New York to London in only 5 hours and 16 minutes—a new record
109140	111160	for a commercial subsonic plane.
111160	116220	On that day, the jet stream was blowing over 200 miles per hour and the Boeing 777 reached
116220	122500	a speed of 745 miles per hour—only 16 miles per hour below the sound barrier.
122500	127340	So when winds can cut an hour off a flight and a 777 burns 2,700 gallons of fuel per
127340	134020	hour and jet fuel costs $1.89 per gallon, that's a $5,103 difference between being
134020	136020	in the right and the wrong winds.
136020	138140	Hopefully you now see why this is important.
138140	141600	So there are all these planes that are flying the exact same route, but usually that's
141600	142600	no problem.
142600	147440	The busiest route in North America—New York to Chicago—sees over 100 flights per day,
147440	151300	leaving as frequently as every 5 minutes during the morning and evening rush, and these planes
151300	153160	just fly the most efficient route.
153160	157120	Before the flight, route planners file a plan with air traffic control and during the flight,
157120	161180	they're just directed by air traffic control in a way that keeps them 5 nautical miles
161180	162320	from other planes.
162320	166480	The difference between New York to Chicago and New York to London is that, over the North
166480	168660	Atlantic, there is no radar.
168660	172680	You see, radar only extends about 250 miles offshore.
172680	175860	Transatlantic planes can be more than 1,000 miles from shore.
175860	180600	That's why every morning, the route planners at Gander Air Traffic Control Center in Gander,
180600	183580	Newfoundland publish the day's North Atlantic tracks.
183580	187460	The night before, every airline that will fly across the Atlantic the following day
187460	192140	sends Gander a preferred route message indicating what they think the best route will be.
192160	197480	For the most part, Gander Center follows these requests and creates a set of 10 or so routes.
197480	201700	These tracks attempt to get the most amount of planes on the most efficient route to Europe.
201700	206540	The tracks are labeled—Zulu being the southernmost route, Yankee being the second southernmost,
206540	209440	then X-Ray, then Whiskey, and so on and so forth.
209440	213080	Here's how a flight on the tracks works, and I'll warn you, this is when the video
213080	214080	gets technical.
214080	216500	Let's say we're going from New York to Paris.
216500	220000	Around half an hour before scheduled departure, the captain talks to normal air traffic control
220000	223080	to request clearance for the route up to around Newfoundland, Canada.
223080	226600	In most cases, clearance is given, and soon after will take off.
226600	229680	About when the plane crosses the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the pilot will request the North
229680	231520	Atlantic track that he or she desires.
231520	235240	Here's today's message describing the day's routes over the Atlantic.
235240	238780	After looking over this, the pilot decides to request track Whiskey.
238780	242580	That means that, at least for now, we'll head towards the Rafin Waypoint—our oceanic
242580	243680	entry point.
243680	246900	Waypoints are fixed spots that are used for flight navigation.
246900	250300	These are much easier for air traffic control to communicate to pilots than map coordinates
250300	251620	when speaking over radio.
251620	254940	Occasionally, you'll see some creatively named waypoints.
254940	258860	Just north of Lebanon, New Hampshire, there's Ham, Burger, and Fries.
258860	263660	On approach to Kansas City Airport, there's Spicy, Barbecue, Turkey, Smoke, Ribs.
263660	267860	Boston has two waypoints in support of their sports teams—the Cubs and Bears.
267860	269620	Some waypoint names are more somber.
269620	273660	On the northern approach route to Washington-Reagan National Airport, just miles away from where
273660	279580	a plane hit the Pentagon on 9-11, the waypoints read, We Will Never Forget, September 11th.
279580	283200	Since the North Atlantic tracks change every day, the modem just gives the entry and exit
283200	285920	waypoints and then coordinates for the route in between.
285920	289520	Since the track coordinates are pre-programmed into the autopilot before takeoff, there's
289520	292800	no reason to name them as waypoints since they won't be given over radio.
292800	296700	In the case of this flight, we're requesting track Whiskey and, more than likely, Gander
296700	300480	Control Center will give us permission, although sometimes they'll tell us to take a different
300480	303760	route, usually because we're closer to another plane than the minimum separation
303760	304760	distance.
304760	307600	Since it's much more difficult to know where planes are over the North Atlantic, they're
307600	312440	required to be 15 minutes separated—about 140 miles, rather than the normal 5 miles
312440	314400	in areas with radar coverage.
314400	317160	Assuming we're granted clearance, we'll head towards the RAF and waypoint and make
317160	319700	sure that our satellite communication systems are working.
319700	323140	Then we'll check to see if our high frequency radio is working—a backup in case other
323140	324960	communications go down.
324960	329260	Minutes later, just after passing RAF and waypoint, the controller will say, Radar service
329260	330420	is terminated.
330420	331420	Have a good night.
331420	333420	And, we're on our own.
333420	336960	All the North Atlantic tracks are preloaded onto autopilot, so there's really nothing
336960	338740	to do except wait.
338740	342580	When we hit 30 degrees west, we'll enter the Shandwick airspace approaching Western
342580	343580	Europe.
343580	347780	We switch our radios to Shandwick's frequency and fly a few more hours to our oceanic exit
347780	353060	point—Gunzo Waypoint—meaning we've successfully traversed the Northern Atlantic.
