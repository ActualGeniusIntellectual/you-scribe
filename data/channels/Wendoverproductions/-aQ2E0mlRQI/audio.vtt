00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
If you've ever looked at a flight tracker sometime around 10 or 11 pm eastern, you might

00:04.480 --> 00:09.640
have noticed something—perfect lines of planes stretching all the way to Europe.

00:09.640 --> 00:14.320
These are just some of the over 2,000 daily flights that cross the northern Atlantic.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.080
With so many flights, there just has to be organization.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.600
This is the most direct route from New York to London.

00:20.600 --> 00:25.360
You may think it's this—a straight line—but that straight line isn't actually a straight

00:25.360 --> 00:26.360
line.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.760
This line is a straight line because, despite what some may think, the earth is curved.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.080
From New York to London the curve you see on a flat map isn't too extreme, but in

00:34.080 --> 00:38.240
the case of a longer flight, such as from New York to Bangkok, the most direct route

00:38.240 --> 00:41.960
is not this, but this—straight over the north pole.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.020
It makes a lot more sense if you look at a north pole oriented map.

00:45.020 --> 00:48.600
If you draw the most direct route between Atlanta and London, you'll see that it passes

00:48.600 --> 00:51.560
over every major east coast international airport.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.620
That means that planes from Atlanta to Europe travel on the exact same route as planes from

00:55.620 --> 00:59.780
Charlotte, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.

00:59.780 --> 01:04.580
All these transatlantic planes typically leave between 6 and 8 pm eastern to time their arrival

01:04.580 --> 01:06.180
for early morning in Europe.

01:06.180 --> 01:10.020
That means that there are potentially hundreds of planes all going the exact same route at

01:10.020 --> 01:11.500
the exact same time.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.480
The north Atlantic also has something known as the jet stream.

01:14.480 --> 01:19.080
These easterly winds average around 110 miles per hour and if planes fly in them, they can

01:19.080 --> 01:21.260
cut hours off their travel time.

01:21.260 --> 01:26.620
However, the winds are only strongest in a line 3 miles high and 100 miles wide.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.680
That further concentrates the flights.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.820
On average, an eastbound transatlantic flight from New York to London takes about 6 hours

01:32.820 --> 01:34.180
and 15 minutes.

01:34.180 --> 01:38.280
Coming back against the jet stream, the same flight takes over 7 hours.

01:38.280 --> 01:43.340
Sometimes the winds can be even more active, such as on January 8th, 2015, when British

01:43.340 --> 01:49.140
Airways flight 114 flew from New York to London in only 5 hours and 16 minutes—a new record

01:49.140 --> 01:51.160
for a commercial subsonic plane.

01:51.160 --> 01:56.220
On that day, the jet stream was blowing over 200 miles per hour and the Boeing 777 reached

01:56.220 --> 02:02.500
a speed of 745 miles per hour—only 16 miles per hour below the sound barrier.

02:02.500 --> 02:07.340
So when winds can cut an hour off a flight and a 777 burns 2,700 gallons of fuel per

02:07.340 --> 02:14.020
hour and jet fuel costs $1.89 per gallon, that's a $5,103 difference between being

02:14.020 --> 02:16.020
in the right and the wrong winds.

02:16.020 --> 02:18.140
Hopefully you now see why this is important.

02:18.140 --> 02:21.600
So there are all these planes that are flying the exact same route, but usually that's

02:21.600 --> 02:22.600
no problem.

02:22.600 --> 02:27.440
The busiest route in North America—New York to Chicago—sees over 100 flights per day,

02:27.440 --> 02:31.300
leaving as frequently as every 5 minutes during the morning and evening rush, and these planes

02:31.300 --> 02:33.160
just fly the most efficient route.

02:33.160 --> 02:37.120
Before the flight, route planners file a plan with air traffic control and during the flight,

02:37.120 --> 02:41.180
they're just directed by air traffic control in a way that keeps them 5 nautical miles

02:41.180 --> 02:42.320
from other planes.

02:42.320 --> 02:46.480
The difference between New York to Chicago and New York to London is that, over the North

02:46.480 --> 02:48.660
Atlantic, there is no radar.

02:48.660 --> 02:52.680
You see, radar only extends about 250 miles offshore.

02:52.680 --> 02:55.860
Transatlantic planes can be more than 1,000 miles from shore.

02:55.860 --> 03:00.600
That's why every morning, the route planners at Gander Air Traffic Control Center in Gander,

03:00.600 --> 03:03.580
Newfoundland publish the day's North Atlantic tracks.

03:03.580 --> 03:07.460
The night before, every airline that will fly across the Atlantic the following day

03:07.460 --> 03:12.140
sends Gander a preferred route message indicating what they think the best route will be.

03:12.160 --> 03:17.480
For the most part, Gander Center follows these requests and creates a set of 10 or so routes.

03:17.480 --> 03:21.700
These tracks attempt to get the most amount of planes on the most efficient route to Europe.

03:21.700 --> 03:26.540
The tracks are labeled—Zulu being the southernmost route, Yankee being the second southernmost,

03:26.540 --> 03:29.440
then X-Ray, then Whiskey, and so on and so forth.

03:29.440 --> 03:33.080
Here's how a flight on the tracks works, and I'll warn you, this is when the video

03:33.080 --> 03:34.080
gets technical.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.500
Let's say we're going from New York to Paris.

03:36.500 --> 03:40.000
Around half an hour before scheduled departure, the captain talks to normal air traffic control

03:40.000 --> 03:43.080
to request clearance for the route up to around Newfoundland, Canada.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.600
In most cases, clearance is given, and soon after will take off.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.680
About when the plane crosses the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the pilot will request the North

03:49.680 --> 03:51.520
Atlantic track that he or she desires.

03:51.520 --> 03:55.240
Here's today's message describing the day's routes over the Atlantic.

03:55.240 --> 03:58.780
After looking over this, the pilot decides to request track Whiskey.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.580
That means that, at least for now, we'll head towards the Rafin Waypoint—our oceanic

04:02.580 --> 04:03.680
entry point.

04:03.680 --> 04:06.900
Waypoints are fixed spots that are used for flight navigation.

04:06.900 --> 04:10.300
These are much easier for air traffic control to communicate to pilots than map coordinates

04:10.300 --> 04:11.620
when speaking over radio.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.940
Occasionally, you'll see some creatively named waypoints.

04:14.940 --> 04:18.860
Just north of Lebanon, New Hampshire, there's Ham, Burger, and Fries.

04:18.860 --> 04:23.660
On approach to Kansas City Airport, there's Spicy, Barbecue, Turkey, Smoke, Ribs.

04:23.660 --> 04:27.860
Boston has two waypoints in support of their sports teams—the Cubs and Bears.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.620
Some waypoint names are more somber.

04:29.620 --> 04:33.660
On the northern approach route to Washington-Reagan National Airport, just miles away from where

04:33.660 --> 04:39.580
a plane hit the Pentagon on 9-11, the waypoints read, We Will Never Forget, September 11th.

04:39.580 --> 04:43.200
Since the North Atlantic tracks change every day, the modem just gives the entry and exit

04:43.200 --> 04:45.920
waypoints and then coordinates for the route in between.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.520
Since the track coordinates are pre-programmed into the autopilot before takeoff, there's

04:49.520 --> 04:52.800
no reason to name them as waypoints since they won't be given over radio.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.700
In the case of this flight, we're requesting track Whiskey and, more than likely, Gander

04:56.700 --> 05:00.480
Control Center will give us permission, although sometimes they'll tell us to take a different

05:00.480 --> 05:03.760
route, usually because we're closer to another plane than the minimum separation

05:03.760 --> 05:04.760
distance.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.600
Since it's much more difficult to know where planes are over the North Atlantic, they're

05:07.600 --> 05:12.440
required to be 15 minutes separated—about 140 miles, rather than the normal 5 miles

05:12.440 --> 05:14.400
in areas with radar coverage.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.160
Assuming we're granted clearance, we'll head towards the RAF and waypoint and make

05:17.160 --> 05:19.700
sure that our satellite communication systems are working.

05:19.700 --> 05:23.140
Then we'll check to see if our high frequency radio is working—a backup in case other

05:23.140 --> 05:24.960
communications go down.

05:24.960 --> 05:29.260
Minutes later, just after passing RAF and waypoint, the controller will say, Radar service

05:29.260 --> 05:30.420
is terminated.

05:30.420 --> 05:31.420
Have a good night.

05:31.420 --> 05:33.420
And, we're on our own.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.960
All the North Atlantic tracks are preloaded onto autopilot, so there's really nothing

05:36.960 --> 05:38.740
to do except wait.

05:38.740 --> 05:42.580
When we hit 30 degrees west, we'll enter the Shandwick airspace approaching Western

05:42.580 --> 05:43.580
Europe.

05:43.580 --> 05:47.780
We switch our radios to Shandwick's frequency and fly a few more hours to our oceanic exit

05:47.780 --> 05:53.060
point—Gunzo Waypoint—meaning we've successfully traversed the Northern Atlantic.

05:53.060 --> 05:55.620
