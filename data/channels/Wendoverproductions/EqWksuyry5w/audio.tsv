0	7140	United's flight 3411 was scheduled to leave Chicago O'Hare Airport at 5.40pm on Sunday,
7140	11300	April 9th to Louisville, Kentucky but after dragging a passenger off the flight and a
11300	16760	two hour delay, it turned into one of the biggest PR disasters an airline has ever seen.
16760	21940	Of course, the impetus of this entire news story is that airlines sell more seats than
21940	23060	they have.
23060	25160	It's just better business.
25160	28540	With any flight, a certain number of people won't show up.
28540	30060	It's called the no-show rate.
30060	34660	Flying with an empty seat is a lost opportunity for an airline to make money, even if someone
34660	39460	did buy a ticket for that seat, so many airlines have instilled complicated systems to predict
39460	41840	how many people will miss their flight.
41840	45180	That no-show rate varies hugely by route and date.
45180	51020	In United's network, Chicago, where flight 3411 left from, likely has a high no-show
51020	52420	rate since it's their hub.
52420	56460	A large percentage of the passengers taking a flight from Chicago connect from another
56460	57460	flight.
57460	62860	And since one quarter of US domestic flights arrive late, many people miss their connections.
62860	68260	In addition, there are a ton of competing airlines and modes of transport from Chicago,
68260	72160	so it's not a huge deal for passengers to change their plans to leave a few hours or
72160	73580	days later.
73580	79500	On a flight from, say, Bangor, Maine, a small rural airport, to Washington DC, passengers
79500	83500	are much less likely to miss or decide not to show up for their flight.
83500	87740	No passengers are connecting through Bangor onto this flight to DC and there are also
87740	89660	very few alternatives.
89660	94580	With only 10-15 flights a day and no train service, missing a flight out of Bangor is
94580	98020	much more inconvenient than one out of Chicago.
98020	103440	Flights on Sunday nights, like flight 3411, are also likely to have a lower no-show rate
103440	106460	since travelers are wary to get back to work on Monday.
106460	110720	There's no good public data on how many passengers miss their flights—it's a closely
110720	115460	guarded secret—but this data is used by airlines to build models that predict how
115460	118500	many seats airlines can safely oversell.
118500	121160	The good news is that these models are getting better.
121160	127480	In 1990, US airlines denied boarding to about 16 out of every 10,000 passengers while today
127480	131200	it's down to 9 out of every 10,000 passengers.
131200	135760	With better and better data and smarter and smarter programs, these models are constantly
135760	140560	improving to let airlines sell these non-existent seats more safely.
140560	145140	In the end, what airlines pay to compensate those half a million yearly passengers who
145140	150100	are bumped from their flights is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars they
150100	155960	can make overbooking—until, of course, it turns into a worldwide PR disaster.
155960	158460	So how can you be sure that you won't be bumped?
158460	162840	When airlines do have to involuntarily select individuals to offload, they'll often use
162840	167200	a hierarchical system—choosing the individuals that supposedly have the least merit to be
167200	170480	on the flight or least value to the airline on paper.
170480	177320	Normally, a computer will pick those who checked in last or have no or low frequent flyer status.
177320	182520	So if you check in early, even online, select a seat, and get your boarding pass, you're
182520	184920	much more likely to fly on your flight.
184920	189440	In addition, having a frequent flyer account, even if you don't use it much, will improve
189440	192940	your odds over the majority of people who don't have one at all.
192940	196120	You can also fly airlines that overbook less.
196280	202040	JetBlue had to involuntarily deny boarding to only 18 out of 21 million passengers in
202040	203640	2013.
203640	208000	Since they sell mostly inflexible tickets with fewer connections, passengers are much
208000	213000	more likely to show up for their flight so JetBlue has a blanket policy not to overbook
213000	214000	flights.
214000	217920	What you have to remember with airlines, however, is that they're constantly trying to find
217920	222360	ways to make more money per seat so that they can reduce ticket prices.
222560	225760	That's not to say that they're altruistic organizations.
225760	230280	They just recognize that the number one determinant to whether someone will fly their airline
230280	235560	is that one number—the ticket price—so they'll take almost any opportunity to reduce
235560	238960	it in order to gain a competitive advantage.
238960	243140	Time and time again it's been proven that the majority of consumers want cheaper flights
243140	245680	more than they want a better travel experience.
245680	249040	That's why budget airlines are making such a disruption.
249040	254740	So this whole trend of unbundled airfares, fees for everything, and even overbooking
254740	261400	is all in response to what the consumer as one entity wants—cheap flights.
