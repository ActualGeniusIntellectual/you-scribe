00:00.000 --> 00:07.140
United's flight 3411 was scheduled to leave Chicago O'Hare Airport at 5.40pm on Sunday,

00:07.140 --> 00:11.300
April 9th to Louisville, Kentucky but after dragging a passenger off the flight and a

00:11.300 --> 00:16.760
two hour delay, it turned into one of the biggest PR disasters an airline has ever seen.

00:16.760 --> 00:21.940
Of course, the impetus of this entire news story is that airlines sell more seats than

00:21.940 --> 00:23.060
they have.

00:23.060 --> 00:25.160
It's just better business.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.540
With any flight, a certain number of people won't show up.

00:28.540 --> 00:30.060
It's called the no-show rate.

00:30.060 --> 00:34.660
Flying with an empty seat is a lost opportunity for an airline to make money, even if someone

00:34.660 --> 00:39.460
did buy a ticket for that seat, so many airlines have instilled complicated systems to predict

00:39.460 --> 00:41.840
how many people will miss their flight.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.180
That no-show rate varies hugely by route and date.

00:45.180 --> 00:51.020
In United's network, Chicago, where flight 3411 left from, likely has a high no-show

00:51.020 --> 00:52.420
rate since it's their hub.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.460
A large percentage of the passengers taking a flight from Chicago connect from another

00:56.460 --> 00:57.460
flight.

00:57.460 --> 01:02.860
And since one quarter of US domestic flights arrive late, many people miss their connections.

01:02.860 --> 01:08.260
In addition, there are a ton of competing airlines and modes of transport from Chicago,

01:08.260 --> 01:12.160
so it's not a huge deal for passengers to change their plans to leave a few hours or

01:12.160 --> 01:13.580
days later.

01:13.580 --> 01:19.500
On a flight from, say, Bangor, Maine, a small rural airport, to Washington DC, passengers

01:19.500 --> 01:23.500
are much less likely to miss or decide not to show up for their flight.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.740
No passengers are connecting through Bangor onto this flight to DC and there are also

01:27.740 --> 01:29.660
very few alternatives.

01:29.660 --> 01:34.580
With only 10-15 flights a day and no train service, missing a flight out of Bangor is

01:34.580 --> 01:38.020
much more inconvenient than one out of Chicago.

01:38.020 --> 01:43.440
Flights on Sunday nights, like flight 3411, are also likely to have a lower no-show rate

01:43.440 --> 01:46.460
since travelers are wary to get back to work on Monday.

01:46.460 --> 01:50.720
There's no good public data on how many passengers miss their flights—it's a closely

01:50.720 --> 01:55.460
guarded secret—but this data is used by airlines to build models that predict how

01:55.460 --> 01:58.500
many seats airlines can safely oversell.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.160
The good news is that these models are getting better.

02:01.160 --> 02:07.480
In 1990, US airlines denied boarding to about 16 out of every 10,000 passengers while today

02:07.480 --> 02:11.200
it's down to 9 out of every 10,000 passengers.

02:11.200 --> 02:15.760
With better and better data and smarter and smarter programs, these models are constantly

02:15.760 --> 02:20.560
improving to let airlines sell these non-existent seats more safely.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.140
In the end, what airlines pay to compensate those half a million yearly passengers who

02:25.140 --> 02:30.100
are bumped from their flights is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars they

02:30.100 --> 02:35.960
can make overbooking—until, of course, it turns into a worldwide PR disaster.

02:35.960 --> 02:38.460
So how can you be sure that you won't be bumped?

02:38.460 --> 02:42.840
When airlines do have to involuntarily select individuals to offload, they'll often use

02:42.840 --> 02:47.200
a hierarchical system—choosing the individuals that supposedly have the least merit to be

02:47.200 --> 02:50.480
on the flight or least value to the airline on paper.

02:50.480 --> 02:57.320
Normally, a computer will pick those who checked in last or have no or low frequent flyer status.

02:57.320 --> 03:02.520
So if you check in early, even online, select a seat, and get your boarding pass, you're

03:02.520 --> 03:04.920
much more likely to fly on your flight.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.440
In addition, having a frequent flyer account, even if you don't use it much, will improve

03:09.440 --> 03:12.940
your odds over the majority of people who don't have one at all.

03:12.940 --> 03:16.120
You can also fly airlines that overbook less.

03:16.280 --> 03:22.040
JetBlue had to involuntarily deny boarding to only 18 out of 21 million passengers in

03:22.040 --> 03:23.640
2013.

03:23.640 --> 03:28.000
Since they sell mostly inflexible tickets with fewer connections, passengers are much

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
more likely to show up for their flight so JetBlue has a blanket policy not to overbook

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
flights.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.920
What you have to remember with airlines, however, is that they're constantly trying to find

03:37.920 --> 03:42.360
ways to make more money per seat so that they can reduce ticket prices.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.760
That's not to say that they're altruistic organizations.

03:45.760 --> 03:50.280
They just recognize that the number one determinant to whether someone will fly their airline

03:50.280 --> 03:55.560
is that one number—the ticket price—so they'll take almost any opportunity to reduce

03:55.560 --> 03:58.960
it in order to gain a competitive advantage.

03:58.960 --> 04:03.140
Time and time again it's been proven that the majority of consumers want cheaper flights

04:03.140 --> 04:05.680
more than they want a better travel experience.

04:05.680 --> 04:09.040
That's why budget airlines are making such a disruption.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.740
So this whole trend of unbundled airfares, fees for everything, and even overbooking

04:14.740 --> 04:21.400
is all in response to what the consumer as one entity wants—cheap flights.

04:21.400 --> 04:25.800
