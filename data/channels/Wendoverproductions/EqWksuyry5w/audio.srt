00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
United's flight 3411 was scheduled to leave Chicago O'Hare Airport at 5.40pm on Sunday,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,300
April 9th to Louisville, Kentucky but after dragging a passenger off the flight and a

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:16,760
two hour delay, it turned into one of the biggest PR disasters an airline has ever seen.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,940
Of course, the impetus of this entire news story is that airlines sell more seats than

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,060
they have.

6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,160
It's just better business.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,540
With any flight, a certain number of people won't show up.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,060
It's called the no-show rate.

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,660
Flying with an empty seat is a lost opportunity for an airline to make money, even if someone

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,460
did buy a ticket for that seat, so many airlines have instilled complicated systems to predict

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,840
how many people will miss their flight.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,180
That no-show rate varies hugely by route and date.

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,020
In United's network, Chicago, where flight 3411 left from, likely has a high no-show

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,420
rate since it's their hub.

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,460
A large percentage of the passengers taking a flight from Chicago connect from another

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,460
flight.

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,860
And since one quarter of US domestic flights arrive late, many people miss their connections.

18
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:08,260
In addition, there are a ton of competing airlines and modes of transport from Chicago,

19
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:12,160
so it's not a huge deal for passengers to change their plans to leave a few hours or

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,580
days later.

21
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:19,500
On a flight from, say, Bangor, Maine, a small rural airport, to Washington DC, passengers

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
are much less likely to miss or decide not to show up for their flight.

23
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,740
No passengers are connecting through Bangor onto this flight to DC and there are also

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,660
very few alternatives.

25
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,580
With only 10-15 flights a day and no train service, missing a flight out of Bangor is

26
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,020
much more inconvenient than one out of Chicago.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,440
Flights on Sunday nights, like flight 3411, are also likely to have a lower no-show rate

28
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,460
since travelers are wary to get back to work on Monday.

29
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,720
There's no good public data on how many passengers miss their flights—it's a closely

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,460
guarded secret—but this data is used by airlines to build models that predict how

31
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,500
many seats airlines can safely oversell.

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,160
The good news is that these models are getting better.

33
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,480
In 1990, US airlines denied boarding to about 16 out of every 10,000 passengers while today

34
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,200
it's down to 9 out of every 10,000 passengers.

35
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,760
With better and better data and smarter and smarter programs, these models are constantly

36
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,560
improving to let airlines sell these non-existent seats more safely.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,140
In the end, what airlines pay to compensate those half a million yearly passengers who

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,100
are bumped from their flights is far less than the hundreds of millions of dollars they

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:35,960
can make overbooking—until, of course, it turns into a worldwide PR disaster.

40
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,460
So how can you be sure that you won't be bumped?

41
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,840
When airlines do have to involuntarily select individuals to offload, they'll often use

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,200
a hierarchical system—choosing the individuals that supposedly have the least merit to be

43
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,480
on the flight or least value to the airline on paper.

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,320
Normally, a computer will pick those who checked in last or have no or low frequent flyer status.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,520
So if you check in early, even online, select a seat, and get your boarding pass, you're

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,920
much more likely to fly on your flight.

47
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,440
In addition, having a frequent flyer account, even if you don't use it much, will improve

48
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,940
your odds over the majority of people who don't have one at all.

49
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,120
You can also fly airlines that overbook less.

50
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,040
JetBlue had to involuntarily deny boarding to only 18 out of 21 million passengers in

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,640
2013.

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,000
Since they sell mostly inflexible tickets with fewer connections, passengers are much

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
more likely to show up for their flight so JetBlue has a blanket policy not to overbook

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
flights.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
What you have to remember with airlines, however, is that they're constantly trying to find

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,360
ways to make more money per seat so that they can reduce ticket prices.

57
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,760
That's not to say that they're altruistic organizations.

58
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,280
They just recognize that the number one determinant to whether someone will fly their airline

59
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,560
is that one number—the ticket price—so they'll take almost any opportunity to reduce

60
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,960
it in order to gain a competitive advantage.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,140
Time and time again it's been proven that the majority of consumers want cheaper flights

62
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,680
more than they want a better travel experience.

63
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,040
That's why budget airlines are making such a disruption.

64
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,740
So this whole trend of unbundled airfares, fees for everything, and even overbooking

65
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:21,400
is all in response to what the consumer as one entity wants—cheap flights.
