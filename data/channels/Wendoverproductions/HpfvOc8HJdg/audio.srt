1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
This will not be a normal Wendover Productions video.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:06,680
That's because I'm getting a Patreon, but first I need to show you why.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,340
So at 5 AM on a recent Saturday morning, I woke up, left my apartment, walked downtown,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,440
took a bus, took a plane, took a bus, took a train, then arrived here—an open field.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,820
It may seem strange that I traveled over 200 miles to an open field, but this was no ordinary

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,020
open field.

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,380
This was Argyleton, a place that was once a story in every major newspaper worldwide.

8
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:34,200
Now this place may sound familiar to you, I talked about it in TWL episode 3.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,880
Argyleton exists, but only according to some maps—it's a paper town.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,500
Back in ye old days, mapping companies devoted an enormous amount of resources to just figuring

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,420
out what existed where.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,340
They had to survey every physical place, map every road, plod every mountain, just so they

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,600
knew what to put on maps.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,060
Some figured out, though, that they didn't have to go out and survey places—they could

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,540
just copy the information from other maps.

16
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,820
They were, after all, mapping the exact same world, so in theory there would be no way

17
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,420
to tell if they were plagiarizing.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,020
That's why paper towns were created.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,260
These towns never existed in real life—they were just randomly and arbitrarily placed.

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,780
If competing maps suddenly started listing paper towns, such as Argyleton, their source

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,100
would know and could prove that they were plagiarizing since there's certainly no

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,180
way that they would get the false information from surveying.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:27,620
Modern maps are constantly updated and adjusted using new technologies like satellite and

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,460
Yes, but a good amount of information on our 21st century maps comes from centuries-old

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,460
maps.

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,460
Modern day companies such as TomTom and TeleAtlas acquired much of their information from slightly

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,900
older companies, who acquired their information from even older companies, and so on and so

28
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,900
forth.

29
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,120
So, remnants of those 19th and 20th century maps sometimes will show up today.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,380
Argyleton is one of those remnants.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,300
Some time down the line, some company placed Argyleton on the map as a copyright trap.

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,900
And decade after decade, nobody noticed, even when it got onto digital maps.

33
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,340
Nobody's actually sure when it got there.

34
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,580
TeleAtlas, who sourced mapping information for Google in the region, tried to figure

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,380
out where Argyleton originated from, but came out inconclusive.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,980
After it was pointed out that, in truth, Argyleton really is just this field, Google removed

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,580
the town from its listings.

38
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,780
In the area, there's no trace of the paper town that once received worldwide media attention.

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:26,540
There are no signs, no souvenirs, nothing, even for perhaps the most famous fake town

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,540
ever.

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,100
So now's when I talk about money.

42
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,280
If there's no way I'll ever convince you to contribute to my Patreon, you can go, but

43
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,020
I do encourage you to hear me out.

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,820
I was able to do such a ridiculous thing as traveling 200 miles to an empty field because

45
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,380
of your guys' support of the channel.

46
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,340
I think this video is much better than the original video I made about Argyleton, partially

47
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,660
because I was able to go to Argyleton in person, and I want to do things like that more.

48
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,900
I've grown enormously, and through adsense, licensing, and freelance, this channel is

49
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,500
now basically my job.

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I make enough through these sources to support myself, but I want this channel to improve.

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,860
That's why I've started this Patreon.

52
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,500
Every dollar you give to my Patreon will be spent directly on the channel.

53
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,140
I'm serious about that.

54
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,340
I will not take a dime of what you contribute.

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,780
I'm even going to release a monthly report showing you where your money went.

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,340
The cool thing about this arrangement is that the two or five or ten dollars you contribute

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,580
will come right back to you in the form of a better video.

58
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,500
You will be directly affecting the quality and quantity of Wendover Productions' videos.

59
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,680
There are a couple of things I want to spend this money on.

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,900
As with this Argyleton video, I think there's value in getting real footage of real places

61
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,860
along with doing research and interviews on location.

62
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,860
Some of the money will likely go to travel expenses to get to these places.

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,000
Additionally, I'd love to hire animators and sound designers and others to improve

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,940
the quality and quantity of my videos.

65
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,900
I'm not going to change format, I promise you.

66
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,420
I will always have the same simple, clear animations in my videos.

67
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,340
They'll just be cleaner and smoother, so a big part of the money will go to this mad

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,140
push for better production quality.

69
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,620
I've tried to create some really rewarding rewards.

70
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,940
At only $2 per video, you'll have early access to my videos, access to the behind

71
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,940
the scenes Patreon feed, and you can wipe your conscience clean for using Adblock.

72
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,340
At $5, you'll get a handwritten letter and stickers sent to wherever you live.

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,300
$15 gets you into a super secret group chat with me and other high level supporters and

74
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,060
your name will be eternalized in the description of all videos you support.

75
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,500
$20 per video will get you an awesome looking Wendover Productions t-shirt.

76
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,360
There are some higher tiers too, but I won't go over them here because I doubt many people

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,660
will actually use them.

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,820
Also, just to be clear, at whatever tier you support, you'll also get the rewards of

79
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,980
the lower levels.

80
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:39,900
So, if you have the means to, I would love your support on Patreon.

81
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,100
I don't need this money to keep doing the channel, I only want it to improve the channel.

82
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,460
So thank you, and good night.
