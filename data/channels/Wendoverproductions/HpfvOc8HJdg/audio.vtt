00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
This will not be a normal Wendover Productions video.

00:02.840 --> 00:06.680
That's because I'm getting a Patreon, but first I need to show you why.

00:06.680 --> 00:12.340
So at 5 AM on a recent Saturday morning, I woke up, left my apartment, walked downtown,

00:12.340 --> 00:17.440
took a bus, took a plane, took a bus, took a train, then arrived here—an open field.

00:17.440 --> 00:22.820
It may seem strange that I traveled over 200 miles to an open field, but this was no ordinary

00:22.820 --> 00:24.020
open field.

00:24.020 --> 00:29.380
This was Argyleton, a place that was once a story in every major newspaper worldwide.

00:29.380 --> 00:34.200
Now this place may sound familiar to you, I talked about it in TWL episode 3.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.880
Argyleton exists, but only according to some maps—it's a paper town.

00:38.880 --> 00:43.500
Back in ye old days, mapping companies devoted an enormous amount of resources to just figuring

00:43.500 --> 00:45.420
out what existed where.

00:45.420 --> 00:50.340
They had to survey every physical place, map every road, plod every mountain, just so they

00:50.340 --> 00:52.600
knew what to put on maps.

00:52.600 --> 00:56.060
Some figured out, though, that they didn't have to go out and survey places—they could

00:56.060 --> 00:58.540
just copy the information from other maps.

00:58.540 --> 01:02.820
They were, after all, mapping the exact same world, so in theory there would be no way

01:02.820 --> 01:04.420
to tell if they were plagiarizing.

01:04.420 --> 01:07.020
That's why paper towns were created.

01:07.020 --> 01:12.260
These towns never existed in real life—they were just randomly and arbitrarily placed.

01:12.260 --> 01:16.780
If competing maps suddenly started listing paper towns, such as Argyleton, their source

01:16.780 --> 01:20.100
would know and could prove that they were plagiarizing since there's certainly no

01:20.100 --> 01:23.180
way that they would get the false information from surveying.

01:23.180 --> 01:27.620
Modern maps are constantly updated and adjusted using new technologies like satellite and

01:27.700 --> 01:32.460
Yes, but a good amount of information on our 21st century maps comes from centuries-old

01:32.460 --> 01:33.460
maps.

01:33.460 --> 01:37.460
Modern day companies such as TomTom and TeleAtlas acquired much of their information from slightly

01:37.460 --> 01:41.900
older companies, who acquired their information from even older companies, and so on and so

01:41.900 --> 01:42.900
forth.

01:42.900 --> 01:47.120
So, remnants of those 19th and 20th century maps sometimes will show up today.

01:47.120 --> 01:49.380
Argyleton is one of those remnants.

01:49.380 --> 01:54.300
Some time down the line, some company placed Argyleton on the map as a copyright trap.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.900
And decade after decade, nobody noticed, even when it got onto digital maps.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.340
Nobody's actually sure when it got there.

02:01.340 --> 02:05.580
TeleAtlas, who sourced mapping information for Google in the region, tried to figure

02:05.580 --> 02:09.380
out where Argyleton originated from, but came out inconclusive.

02:09.380 --> 02:13.980
After it was pointed out that, in truth, Argyleton really is just this field, Google removed

02:13.980 --> 02:15.580
the town from its listings.

02:15.580 --> 02:20.780
In the area, there's no trace of the paper town that once received worldwide media attention.

02:20.780 --> 02:26.540
There are no signs, no souvenirs, nothing, even for perhaps the most famous fake town

02:26.540 --> 02:27.540
ever.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.100
So now's when I talk about money.

02:29.100 --> 02:33.280
If there's no way I'll ever convince you to contribute to my Patreon, you can go, but

02:33.280 --> 02:35.020
I do encourage you to hear me out.

02:35.020 --> 02:39.820
I was able to do such a ridiculous thing as traveling 200 miles to an empty field because

02:39.820 --> 02:41.380
of your guys' support of the channel.

02:41.380 --> 02:45.340
I think this video is much better than the original video I made about Argyleton, partially

02:45.340 --> 02:49.660
because I was able to go to Argyleton in person, and I want to do things like that more.

02:49.740 --> 02:53.900
I've grown enormously, and through adsense, licensing, and freelance, this channel is

02:53.900 --> 02:55.500
now basically my job.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.500
I make enough through these sources to support myself, but I want this channel to improve.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.860
That's why I've started this Patreon.

03:01.860 --> 03:05.500
Every dollar you give to my Patreon will be spent directly on the channel.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.140
I'm serious about that.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.340
I will not take a dime of what you contribute.

03:09.340 --> 03:13.780
I'm even going to release a monthly report showing you where your money went.

03:13.780 --> 03:18.340
The cool thing about this arrangement is that the two or five or ten dollars you contribute

03:18.420 --> 03:21.580
will come right back to you in the form of a better video.

03:21.580 --> 03:26.500
You will be directly affecting the quality and quantity of Wendover Productions' videos.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.680
There are a couple of things I want to spend this money on.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.900
As with this Argyleton video, I think there's value in getting real footage of real places

03:32.900 --> 03:35.860
along with doing research and interviews on location.

03:35.860 --> 03:38.860
Some of the money will likely go to travel expenses to get to these places.

03:38.860 --> 03:43.000
Additionally, I'd love to hire animators and sound designers and others to improve

03:43.000 --> 03:44.940
the quality and quantity of my videos.

03:44.940 --> 03:47.900
I'm not going to change format, I promise you.

03:47.900 --> 03:51.420
I will always have the same simple, clear animations in my videos.

03:51.420 --> 03:55.340
They'll just be cleaner and smoother, so a big part of the money will go to this mad

03:55.340 --> 03:57.140
push for better production quality.

03:57.140 --> 04:00.620
I've tried to create some really rewarding rewards.

04:00.620 --> 04:04.940
At only $2 per video, you'll have early access to my videos, access to the behind

04:04.940 --> 04:08.940
the scenes Patreon feed, and you can wipe your conscience clean for using Adblock.

04:08.940 --> 04:13.340
At $5, you'll get a handwritten letter and stickers sent to wherever you live.

04:13.340 --> 04:18.300
$15 gets you into a super secret group chat with me and other high level supporters and

04:18.300 --> 04:22.060
your name will be eternalized in the description of all videos you support.

04:22.060 --> 04:25.500
$20 per video will get you an awesome looking Wendover Productions t-shirt.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.360
There are some higher tiers too, but I won't go over them here because I doubt many people

04:29.360 --> 04:30.660
will actually use them.

04:30.660 --> 04:34.820
Also, just to be clear, at whatever tier you support, you'll also get the rewards of

04:34.820 --> 04:35.980
the lower levels.

04:35.980 --> 04:39.900
So, if you have the means to, I would love your support on Patreon.

04:39.900 --> 04:44.100
I don't need this money to keep doing the channel, I only want it to improve the channel.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.460
So thank you, and good night.
