0	2840	This will not be a normal Wendover Productions video.
2840	6680	That's because I'm getting a Patreon, but first I need to show you why.
6680	12340	So at 5 AM on a recent Saturday morning, I woke up, left my apartment, walked downtown,
12340	17440	took a bus, took a plane, took a bus, took a train, then arrived here—an open field.
17440	22820	It may seem strange that I traveled over 200 miles to an open field, but this was no ordinary
22820	24020	open field.
24020	29380	This was Argyleton, a place that was once a story in every major newspaper worldwide.
29380	34200	Now this place may sound familiar to you, I talked about it in TWL episode 3.
34200	38880	Argyleton exists, but only according to some maps—it's a paper town.
38880	43500	Back in ye old days, mapping companies devoted an enormous amount of resources to just figuring
43500	45420	out what existed where.
45420	50340	They had to survey every physical place, map every road, plod every mountain, just so they
50340	52600	knew what to put on maps.
52600	56060	Some figured out, though, that they didn't have to go out and survey places—they could
56060	58540	just copy the information from other maps.
58540	62820	They were, after all, mapping the exact same world, so in theory there would be no way
62820	64420	to tell if they were plagiarizing.
64420	67020	That's why paper towns were created.
67020	72260	These towns never existed in real life—they were just randomly and arbitrarily placed.
72260	76780	If competing maps suddenly started listing paper towns, such as Argyleton, their source
76780	80100	would know and could prove that they were plagiarizing since there's certainly no
80100	83180	way that they would get the false information from surveying.
83180	87620	Modern maps are constantly updated and adjusted using new technologies like satellite and
87700	92460	Yes, but a good amount of information on our 21st century maps comes from centuries-old
92460	93460	maps.
93460	97460	Modern day companies such as TomTom and TeleAtlas acquired much of their information from slightly
97460	101900	older companies, who acquired their information from even older companies, and so on and so
101900	102900	forth.
102900	107120	So, remnants of those 19th and 20th century maps sometimes will show up today.
107120	109380	Argyleton is one of those remnants.
109380	114300	Some time down the line, some company placed Argyleton on the map as a copyright trap.
114300	118900	And decade after decade, nobody noticed, even when it got onto digital maps.
118900	121340	Nobody's actually sure when it got there.
121340	125580	TeleAtlas, who sourced mapping information for Google in the region, tried to figure
125580	129380	out where Argyleton originated from, but came out inconclusive.
129380	133980	After it was pointed out that, in truth, Argyleton really is just this field, Google removed
133980	135580	the town from its listings.
135580	140780	In the area, there's no trace of the paper town that once received worldwide media attention.
140780	146540	There are no signs, no souvenirs, nothing, even for perhaps the most famous fake town
146540	147540	ever.
147540	149100	So now's when I talk about money.
149100	153280	If there's no way I'll ever convince you to contribute to my Patreon, you can go, but
153280	155020	I do encourage you to hear me out.
155020	159820	I was able to do such a ridiculous thing as traveling 200 miles to an empty field because
159820	161380	of your guys' support of the channel.
161380	165340	I think this video is much better than the original video I made about Argyleton, partially
165340	169660	because I was able to go to Argyleton in person, and I want to do things like that more.
169740	173900	I've grown enormously, and through adsense, licensing, and freelance, this channel is
173900	175500	now basically my job.
175500	179500	I make enough through these sources to support myself, but I want this channel to improve.
179500	181860	That's why I've started this Patreon.
181860	185500	Every dollar you give to my Patreon will be spent directly on the channel.
185500	187140	I'm serious about that.
187140	189340	I will not take a dime of what you contribute.
189340	193780	I'm even going to release a monthly report showing you where your money went.
193780	198340	The cool thing about this arrangement is that the two or five or ten dollars you contribute
198420	201580	will come right back to you in the form of a better video.
201580	206500	You will be directly affecting the quality and quantity of Wendover Productions' videos.
206500	208680	There are a couple of things I want to spend this money on.
208680	212900	As with this Argyleton video, I think there's value in getting real footage of real places
212900	215860	along with doing research and interviews on location.
215860	218860	Some of the money will likely go to travel expenses to get to these places.
218860	223000	Additionally, I'd love to hire animators and sound designers and others to improve
223000	224940	the quality and quantity of my videos.
224940	227900	I'm not going to change format, I promise you.
227900	231420	I will always have the same simple, clear animations in my videos.
231420	235340	They'll just be cleaner and smoother, so a big part of the money will go to this mad
235340	237140	push for better production quality.
237140	240620	I've tried to create some really rewarding rewards.
240620	244940	At only $2 per video, you'll have early access to my videos, access to the behind
244940	248940	the scenes Patreon feed, and you can wipe your conscience clean for using Adblock.
248940	253340	At $5, you'll get a handwritten letter and stickers sent to wherever you live.
253340	258300	$15 gets you into a super secret group chat with me and other high level supporters and
258300	262060	your name will be eternalized in the description of all videos you support.
262060	265500	$20 per video will get you an awesome looking Wendover Productions t-shirt.
265500	269360	There are some higher tiers too, but I won't go over them here because I doubt many people
269360	270660	will actually use them.
270660	274820	Also, just to be clear, at whatever tier you support, you'll also get the rewards of
274820	275980	the lower levels.
275980	279900	So, if you have the means to, I would love your support on Patreon.
279900	284100	I don't need this money to keep doing the channel, I only want it to improve the channel.
284100	285460	So thank you, and good night.
