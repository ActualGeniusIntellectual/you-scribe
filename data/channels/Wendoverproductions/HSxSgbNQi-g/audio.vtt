00:10.800 --> 00:16.500
It'll be a cold day in hell before I let twins fly long-haul over-water routes.

00:16.500 --> 00:21.320
Those were the words of Lynn Helms, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration during

00:21.320 --> 00:23.360
the Reagan administration.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.580
At the time, no commercial American airplane with two engines was allowed to fly anywhere

00:27.580 --> 00:30.620
farther than 60 minutes from a diversion airport.

00:30.620 --> 00:35.560
The belief was that, if one engine failed, the other could only safely fly the plane

00:35.560 --> 00:40.680
for about an hour, but this rule severely limited what smaller planes could do.

00:40.680 --> 00:44.860
On North Atlantic routes like New York to London, twin-engined planes could only fly

00:44.860 --> 00:48.420
in these areas, but a direct route looked like this.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.860
The options were to either fly a twin-engined plane on an inefficient routing or fly an

00:52.860 --> 00:55.460
inefficient three or four engine plane.

00:55.460 --> 01:00.000
There was no place for long and skinny routes between smaller cities using smaller planes

01:00.000 --> 01:03.720
since airlines couldn't legally fly those smaller planes.

01:03.720 --> 01:08.220
This one simple rule changed the very way airplanes were built.

01:08.220 --> 01:13.460
Now in the 60's, this 60 minute regulation only applied to planes with two engines.

01:13.460 --> 01:18.080
Of course aircraft manufacturers could build quad-engine jets, but those had to be huge

01:18.080 --> 01:21.580
for airlines to make their money's worth with the high fuel consumption.

01:21.580 --> 01:26.400
The 747's of the time could carry more than 400 passengers.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.380
They could therefore only fly on super high demand routes like New York to London to have

01:31.380 --> 01:33.420
any hope of being full.

01:33.420 --> 01:37.980
In order to start flying more convenient non-stop routes from smaller markets, planes had to

01:37.980 --> 01:41.700
get smaller while still being legally allowed to hop the pond.

01:41.700 --> 01:44.140
That's where tri-jets came into play.

01:44.140 --> 01:48.620
With three engines, these planes weren't subject to the same 60 minute regulation as

01:48.620 --> 01:49.700
twin-jets.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.220
They could easily fly any transatlantic route.

01:52.220 --> 01:56.660
That's why in the 70's and 80's the long-haul jets you'd see at airports were,

01:56.660 --> 02:01.160
for the most part, either 747's or tri-jets like the DC-10.

02:01.160 --> 02:05.700
This 60 minute regulation was inconvenient for Atlantic crossings but in the Pacific

02:05.700 --> 02:09.720
it actually changed how Hawaii as a state developed.

02:09.720 --> 02:14.740
There are zero diversion airports between California and Hawaii so the route isn't

02:14.740 --> 02:17.820
even close to covered under the 60 minute rule.

02:17.820 --> 02:23.020
As a result, airlines could only fly huge planes between the mainland and Hawaii which

02:23.020 --> 02:26.500
meant the planes could pretty much only fly to Honolulu.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.280
There was virtually no service to the other islands from the mainland which meant they

02:30.280 --> 02:31.940
were severely isolated.

02:31.940 --> 02:36.140
That's part of the reason why the tourism industry only picked up on the other islands

02:36.140 --> 02:37.940
in recent decades.

02:37.940 --> 02:42.860
The 60 minute rule originated from the days of piston-driven propeller aircraft.

02:42.860 --> 02:46.500
With these, it was far more common for engines to just stop working mid-flight.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.340
That's why there were contingency engines.

02:49.340 --> 02:54.260
The regulations just didn't adapt to the increased reliability of jet engines.

02:54.260 --> 03:01.220
Statistically, for every failure of a jet engine, there are 117 piston engine failures.

03:01.220 --> 03:06.140
Once the jet age rolled in, engine failure just wasn't as much of a concern so, in

03:06.140 --> 03:11.940
1985, the FAA begrudgingly granted permission to Trans World Airlines to fly their twin

03:11.940 --> 03:19.260
engined 767 direct between Boston and Paris—a route taking it up to 120 minutes away from

03:19.260 --> 03:20.620
diversion airports.

03:20.620 --> 03:25.860
This was the first example of a brand new FAA certification called ETOPS—Extended

03:25.860 --> 03:30.820
Range Twin Engine Operational Performance Standards or more colloquially, Engines Turn

03:30.820 --> 03:32.420
or Passenger Swim.

03:32.420 --> 03:36.460
Before an airline can fly on long over-water route, they have to buy a plane with what's

03:36.460 --> 03:38.940
known as an ETOPS type rating.

03:38.940 --> 03:42.260
Basically that means that the plane was built with adequate redundancies, communication

03:42.260 --> 03:46.940
systems, and fire suppression systems to fly safely if one engine fails.

03:46.940 --> 03:51.820
For example, the 767, the first plane to get an ETOPS certification, has a type rating

03:51.820 --> 03:56.940
of 180 minutes meaning it can fly anywhere as long as it's within 180 minutes from

03:56.940 --> 03:58.340
a diversion airport.

03:58.340 --> 04:03.100
But just because a plane has an ETOPS type rating doesn't mean an airline can fly at

04:03.100 --> 04:04.100
ETOPS.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.860
They have to have a special maintenance plan, a special flight crew, special cabin crew,

04:07.860 --> 04:13.020
special dispatchers, special fuel quantities, and special passenger recovery plans since,

04:13.020 --> 04:17.540
just because there's a runway, doesn't mean a plane can safely divert since the emergency

04:17.540 --> 04:20.780
doesn't necessarily end once the plane lands.

04:20.780 --> 04:25.740
Cold Bay, Alaska, for example, is a perfect diversion airport for routes between Asia

04:25.740 --> 04:26.740
and North America.

04:26.740 --> 04:31.420
It only has six commercial flights per week nowadays but as a former air force base it

04:31.420 --> 04:33.460
has an enormous runway.

04:33.460 --> 04:39.860
The only issue is that the town of Cold Bay has a population of 108—it's tiny so any

04:39.860 --> 04:44.900
diversions automatically double or triple the amount of people in the small town.

04:44.900 --> 04:49.140
There certainly aren't enough hotel rooms or restaurants to house and feed stranded

04:49.140 --> 04:54.620
passengers so, if airlines plan to use Cold Bay as a diversion airport, they need to make

04:54.620 --> 05:00.380
a plan for how to house, feed, and recover passengers within 48 hours of landing.

05:00.380 --> 05:05.740
Last year, an American Airlines 787 was flying from Shanghai to Chicago when its right engine

05:05.740 --> 05:08.500
had an issue halfway across the Pacific Ocean.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.860
The plane quickly took a left turn diverting to Cold Bay.

05:11.860 --> 05:16.020
Even before landing, the passenger recovery plan was implemented as flight attendants

05:16.020 --> 05:18.500
served a second meal service early.

05:18.500 --> 05:22.660
Just a few hours after safely landing in Cold Bay, American's mechanics took off from

05:22.660 --> 05:27.500
Seattle bound for Cold Bay to start fixing the plane while Alaska Airlines, American's

05:27.500 --> 05:31.500
partner, sent a 737 from Anchorage to pick up the stranded passengers.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.340
Meanwhile, flight attendants served the third set of meals they had stocked while waiting

05:35.340 --> 05:39.640
on the ground and the Coast Guard opened their heated hangar to passengers.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.580
Just ten hours after the emergency landing, passengers were on their way to Anchorage

05:43.580 --> 05:48.540
where they spent the night before taking an American 757 to Chicago.

05:48.540 --> 05:52.660
That was a perfect example of how the passenger recovery plan worked.

05:52.660 --> 05:57.620
The quick response and defined plan helped the airline get passengers out safely and

05:57.620 --> 05:58.620
quickly.

05:58.620 --> 06:03.580
Now, because of this solid engine reliability, numerous redundancies, and well-designed passenger

06:03.580 --> 06:09.340
recovery plans, airlines and airplanes can now receive some insane ETOP certifications.

06:09.340 --> 06:16.280
The 787 Dreamliner, the plane that diverted to Cold Bay, has a type rating of 330 minutes.

06:16.280 --> 06:21.220
That means it can fly up to five and a half hours away from a diversion airport.

06:21.220 --> 06:25.100
Modern routes over long ocean stretches in the southern hemisphere were theoretically

06:25.100 --> 06:30.340
possible in the past with four-engine planes, but were economically impossible since airlines

06:30.340 --> 06:35.860
could never fill the large planes on the low-demand city pairs like Melbourne to Santiago.

06:35.860 --> 06:42.380
With the ETOPS 330 certification, LATAM Airlines can fly their small 787 economically on this

06:42.380 --> 06:45.680
relatively low-demand route across the South Pacific.

06:45.680 --> 06:52.360
The Airbus A350 is even rated for ETOPS 370, it can fly six hours and ten minutes away

06:52.360 --> 06:54.160
from diversion airports.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.920
This plane can therefore fly everywhere on earth except directly over the South Pole.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.400
Because of this simple rule change, three and four-engine planes are largely a relic

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
of the past.

07:05.400 --> 07:10.760
Boeing and Airbus' largest jets are both their only four-engine planes in production—the

07:10.760 --> 07:12.840
747 and A380.

07:12.840 --> 07:17.600
The all-North Atlantic traffic today is on twin-engine planes as smaller and smaller

07:17.600 --> 07:20.000
planes get ETOPS certifications.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.720
Air Canada, for example, flies their tiny 120-passenger A319 with ETOPS certification

07:26.720 --> 07:30.060
daily between St. John's Airport and London Heathrow.

07:30.060 --> 07:36.240
British Airways even sends the even smaller A318 between New York and London City Airport.

07:36.240 --> 07:40.840
These routes would have been unimaginable 30 years ago, but the reliability of the airplanes

07:40.840 --> 07:46.640
of today mean that we need not fear flying small planes over big oceans.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.920
This video was made possible by Hover.

07:48.920 --> 07:54.120
I talked last time about how Hover is a fantastic way to get a unique domain just like my new

07:54.120 --> 07:59.280
Wendover.Productions domain, but I want to stress this time just how professional a custom

07:59.280 --> 08:00.560
email address is.

08:00.560 --> 08:06.260
For $5 for the entire year, I set up an email ending in "@Wendover.Productions to forward

08:06.260 --> 08:08.020
to my existing business email."

08:08.220 --> 08:12.820
Not only is this email much more memorable, it also oozes professionalism.

08:12.820 --> 08:18.620
Surely that's worth the $5 that you'd otherwise spend on one 160th of an ETOPS flight

08:18.620 --> 08:20.380
to London, right?

08:20.380 --> 08:25.740
