10800	16500	It'll be a cold day in hell before I let twins fly long-haul over-water routes.
16500	21320	Those were the words of Lynn Helms, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration during
21320	23360	the Reagan administration.
23360	27580	At the time, no commercial American airplane with two engines was allowed to fly anywhere
27580	30620	farther than 60 minutes from a diversion airport.
30620	35560	The belief was that, if one engine failed, the other could only safely fly the plane
35560	40680	for about an hour, but this rule severely limited what smaller planes could do.
40680	44860	On North Atlantic routes like New York to London, twin-engined planes could only fly
44860	48420	in these areas, but a direct route looked like this.
48420	52860	The options were to either fly a twin-engined plane on an inefficient routing or fly an
52860	55460	inefficient three or four engine plane.
55460	60000	There was no place for long and skinny routes between smaller cities using smaller planes
60000	63720	since airlines couldn't legally fly those smaller planes.
63720	68220	This one simple rule changed the very way airplanes were built.
68220	73460	Now in the 60's, this 60 minute regulation only applied to planes with two engines.
73460	78080	Of course aircraft manufacturers could build quad-engine jets, but those had to be huge
78080	81580	for airlines to make their money's worth with the high fuel consumption.
81580	86400	The 747's of the time could carry more than 400 passengers.
86400	91380	They could therefore only fly on super high demand routes like New York to London to have
91380	93420	any hope of being full.
93420	97980	In order to start flying more convenient non-stop routes from smaller markets, planes had to
97980	101700	get smaller while still being legally allowed to hop the pond.
101700	104140	That's where tri-jets came into play.
104140	108620	With three engines, these planes weren't subject to the same 60 minute regulation as
108620	109700	twin-jets.
109700	112220	They could easily fly any transatlantic route.
112220	116660	That's why in the 70's and 80's the long-haul jets you'd see at airports were,
116660	121160	for the most part, either 747's or tri-jets like the DC-10.
121160	125700	This 60 minute regulation was inconvenient for Atlantic crossings but in the Pacific
125700	129720	it actually changed how Hawaii as a state developed.
129720	134740	There are zero diversion airports between California and Hawaii so the route isn't
134740	137820	even close to covered under the 60 minute rule.
137820	143020	As a result, airlines could only fly huge planes between the mainland and Hawaii which
143020	146500	meant the planes could pretty much only fly to Honolulu.
146500	150280	There was virtually no service to the other islands from the mainland which meant they
150280	151940	were severely isolated.
151940	156140	That's part of the reason why the tourism industry only picked up on the other islands
156140	157940	in recent decades.
157940	162860	The 60 minute rule originated from the days of piston-driven propeller aircraft.
162860	166500	With these, it was far more common for engines to just stop working mid-flight.
166500	169340	That's why there were contingency engines.
169340	174260	The regulations just didn't adapt to the increased reliability of jet engines.
174260	181220	Statistically, for every failure of a jet engine, there are 117 piston engine failures.
181220	186140	Once the jet age rolled in, engine failure just wasn't as much of a concern so, in
186140	191940	1985, the FAA begrudgingly granted permission to Trans World Airlines to fly their twin
191940	199260	engined 767 direct between Boston and Paris—a route taking it up to 120 minutes away from
199260	200620	diversion airports.
200620	205860	This was the first example of a brand new FAA certification called ETOPS—Extended
205860	210820	Range Twin Engine Operational Performance Standards or more colloquially, Engines Turn
210820	212420	or Passenger Swim.
212420	216460	Before an airline can fly on long over-water route, they have to buy a plane with what's
216460	218940	known as an ETOPS type rating.
218940	222260	Basically that means that the plane was built with adequate redundancies, communication
222260	226940	systems, and fire suppression systems to fly safely if one engine fails.
226940	231820	For example, the 767, the first plane to get an ETOPS certification, has a type rating
231820	236940	of 180 minutes meaning it can fly anywhere as long as it's within 180 minutes from
236940	238340	a diversion airport.
238340	243100	But just because a plane has an ETOPS type rating doesn't mean an airline can fly at
243100	244100	ETOPS.
244100	247860	They have to have a special maintenance plan, a special flight crew, special cabin crew,
247860	253020	special dispatchers, special fuel quantities, and special passenger recovery plans since,
253020	257540	just because there's a runway, doesn't mean a plane can safely divert since the emergency
257540	260780	doesn't necessarily end once the plane lands.
260780	265740	Cold Bay, Alaska, for example, is a perfect diversion airport for routes between Asia
265740	266740	and North America.
266740	271420	It only has six commercial flights per week nowadays but as a former air force base it
271420	273460	has an enormous runway.
273460	279860	The only issue is that the town of Cold Bay has a population of 108—it's tiny so any
279860	284900	diversions automatically double or triple the amount of people in the small town.
284900	289140	There certainly aren't enough hotel rooms or restaurants to house and feed stranded
289140	294620	passengers so, if airlines plan to use Cold Bay as a diversion airport, they need to make
294620	300380	a plan for how to house, feed, and recover passengers within 48 hours of landing.
300380	305740	Last year, an American Airlines 787 was flying from Shanghai to Chicago when its right engine
305740	308500	had an issue halfway across the Pacific Ocean.
308500	311860	The plane quickly took a left turn diverting to Cold Bay.
311860	316020	Even before landing, the passenger recovery plan was implemented as flight attendants
316020	318500	served a second meal service early.
318500	322660	Just a few hours after safely landing in Cold Bay, American's mechanics took off from
322660	327500	Seattle bound for Cold Bay to start fixing the plane while Alaska Airlines, American's
327500	331500	partner, sent a 737 from Anchorage to pick up the stranded passengers.
331500	335340	Meanwhile, flight attendants served the third set of meals they had stocked while waiting
335340	339640	on the ground and the Coast Guard opened their heated hangar to passengers.
339640	343580	Just ten hours after the emergency landing, passengers were on their way to Anchorage
343580	348540	where they spent the night before taking an American 757 to Chicago.
348540	352660	That was a perfect example of how the passenger recovery plan worked.
352660	357620	The quick response and defined plan helped the airline get passengers out safely and
357620	358620	quickly.
358620	363580	Now, because of this solid engine reliability, numerous redundancies, and well-designed passenger
363580	369340	recovery plans, airlines and airplanes can now receive some insane ETOP certifications.
369340	376280	The 787 Dreamliner, the plane that diverted to Cold Bay, has a type rating of 330 minutes.
376280	381220	That means it can fly up to five and a half hours away from a diversion airport.
381220	385100	Modern routes over long ocean stretches in the southern hemisphere were theoretically
385100	390340	possible in the past with four-engine planes, but were economically impossible since airlines
390340	395860	could never fill the large planes on the low-demand city pairs like Melbourne to Santiago.
395860	402380	With the ETOPS 330 certification, LATAM Airlines can fly their small 787 economically on this
402380	405680	relatively low-demand route across the South Pacific.
405680	412360	The Airbus A350 is even rated for ETOPS 370, it can fly six hours and ten minutes away
412360	414160	from diversion airports.
414160	419920	This plane can therefore fly everywhere on earth except directly over the South Pole.
419920	424400	Because of this simple rule change, three and four-engine planes are largely a relic
424400	425400	of the past.
425400	430760	Boeing and Airbus' largest jets are both their only four-engine planes in production—the
430760	432840	747 and A380.
432840	437600	The all-North Atlantic traffic today is on twin-engine planes as smaller and smaller
437600	440000	planes get ETOPS certifications.
440000	446720	Air Canada, for example, flies their tiny 120-passenger A319 with ETOPS certification
446720	450060	daily between St. John's Airport and London Heathrow.
450060	456240	British Airways even sends the even smaller A318 between New York and London City Airport.
456240	460840	These routes would have been unimaginable 30 years ago, but the reliability of the airplanes
460840	466640	of today mean that we need not fear flying small planes over big oceans.
466640	468920	This video was made possible by Hover.
468920	474120	I talked last time about how Hover is a fantastic way to get a unique domain just like my new
474120	479280	Wendover.Productions domain, but I want to stress this time just how professional a custom
479280	480560	email address is.
480560	486260	For $5 for the entire year, I set up an email ending in "@Wendover.Productions to forward
486260	488020	to my existing business email."
488220	492820	Not only is this email much more memorable, it also oozes professionalism.
492820	498620	Surely that's worth the $5 that you'd otherwise spend on one 160th of an ETOPS flight
498620	500380	to London, right?
