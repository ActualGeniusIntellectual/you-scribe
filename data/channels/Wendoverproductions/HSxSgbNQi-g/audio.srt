4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,500
It'll be a cold day in hell before I let twins fly long-haul over-water routes.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,320
Those were the words of Lynn Helms, administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration during

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,360
the Reagan administration.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,580
At the time, no commercial American airplane with two engines was allowed to fly anywhere

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:30,620
farther than 60 minutes from a diversion airport.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,560
The belief was that, if one engine failed, the other could only safely fly the plane

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,680
for about an hour, but this rule severely limited what smaller planes could do.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,860
On North Atlantic routes like New York to London, twin-engined planes could only fly

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,420
in these areas, but a direct route looked like this.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,860
The options were to either fly a twin-engined plane on an inefficient routing or fly an

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,460
inefficient three or four engine plane.

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,000
There was no place for long and skinny routes between smaller cities using smaller planes

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,720
since airlines couldn't legally fly those smaller planes.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,220
This one simple rule changed the very way airplanes were built.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,460
Now in the 60's, this 60 minute regulation only applied to planes with two engines.

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:18,080
Of course aircraft manufacturers could build quad-engine jets, but those had to be huge

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,580
for airlines to make their money's worth with the high fuel consumption.

21
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,400
The 747's of the time could carry more than 400 passengers.

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,380
They could therefore only fly on super high demand routes like New York to London to have

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,420
any hope of being full.

24
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,980
In order to start flying more convenient non-stop routes from smaller markets, planes had to

25
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,700
get smaller while still being legally allowed to hop the pond.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,140
That's where tri-jets came into play.

27
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,620
With three engines, these planes weren't subject to the same 60 minute regulation as

28
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,700
twin-jets.

29
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,220
They could easily fly any transatlantic route.

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,660
That's why in the 70's and 80's the long-haul jets you'd see at airports were,

31
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,160
for the most part, either 747's or tri-jets like the DC-10.

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,700
This 60 minute regulation was inconvenient for Atlantic crossings but in the Pacific

33
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,720
it actually changed how Hawaii as a state developed.

34
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,740
There are zero diversion airports between California and Hawaii so the route isn't

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,820
even close to covered under the 60 minute rule.

36
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,020
As a result, airlines could only fly huge planes between the mainland and Hawaii which

37
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,500
meant the planes could pretty much only fly to Honolulu.

38
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,280
There was virtually no service to the other islands from the mainland which meant they

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,940
were severely isolated.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,140
That's part of the reason why the tourism industry only picked up on the other islands

41
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,940
in recent decades.

42
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,860
The 60 minute rule originated from the days of piston-driven propeller aircraft.

43
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,500
With these, it was far more common for engines to just stop working mid-flight.

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,340
That's why there were contingency engines.

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,260
The regulations just didn't adapt to the increased reliability of jet engines.

46
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:01,220
Statistically, for every failure of a jet engine, there are 117 piston engine failures.

47
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,140
Once the jet age rolled in, engine failure just wasn't as much of a concern so, in

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:11,940
1985, the FAA begrudgingly granted permission to Trans World Airlines to fly their twin

49
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:19,260
engined 767 direct between Boston and Paris—a route taking it up to 120 minutes away from

50
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,620
diversion airports.

51
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,860
This was the first example of a brand new FAA certification called ETOPS—Extended

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:30,820
Range Twin Engine Operational Performance Standards or more colloquially, Engines Turn

53
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,420
or Passenger Swim.

54
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,460
Before an airline can fly on long over-water route, they have to buy a plane with what's

55
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,940
known as an ETOPS type rating.

56
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:42,260
Basically that means that the plane was built with adequate redundancies, communication

57
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,940
systems, and fire suppression systems to fly safely if one engine fails.

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,820
For example, the 767, the first plane to get an ETOPS certification, has a type rating

59
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,940
of 180 minutes meaning it can fly anywhere as long as it's within 180 minutes from

60
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,340
a diversion airport.

61
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:03,100
But just because a plane has an ETOPS type rating doesn't mean an airline can fly at

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,100
ETOPS.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,860
They have to have a special maintenance plan, a special flight crew, special cabin crew,

64
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,020
special dispatchers, special fuel quantities, and special passenger recovery plans since,

65
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,540
just because there's a runway, doesn't mean a plane can safely divert since the emergency

66
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,780
doesn't necessarily end once the plane lands.

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,740
Cold Bay, Alaska, for example, is a perfect diversion airport for routes between Asia

68
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,740
and North America.

69
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,420
It only has six commercial flights per week nowadays but as a former air force base it

70
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,460
has an enormous runway.

71
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,860
The only issue is that the town of Cold Bay has a population of 108—it's tiny so any

72
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,900
diversions automatically double or triple the amount of people in the small town.

73
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:49,140
There certainly aren't enough hotel rooms or restaurants to house and feed stranded

74
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,620
passengers so, if airlines plan to use Cold Bay as a diversion airport, they need to make

75
00:04:54,620 --> 00:05:00,380
a plan for how to house, feed, and recover passengers within 48 hours of landing.

76
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:05,740
Last year, an American Airlines 787 was flying from Shanghai to Chicago when its right engine

77
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,500
had an issue halfway across the Pacific Ocean.

78
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,860
The plane quickly took a left turn diverting to Cold Bay.

79
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,020
Even before landing, the passenger recovery plan was implemented as flight attendants

80
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,500
served a second meal service early.

81
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,660
Just a few hours after safely landing in Cold Bay, American's mechanics took off from

82
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,500
Seattle bound for Cold Bay to start fixing the plane while Alaska Airlines, American's

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,500
partner, sent a 737 from Anchorage to pick up the stranded passengers.

84
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,340
Meanwhile, flight attendants served the third set of meals they had stocked while waiting

85
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,640
on the ground and the Coast Guard opened their heated hangar to passengers.

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,580
Just ten hours after the emergency landing, passengers were on their way to Anchorage

87
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,540
where they spent the night before taking an American 757 to Chicago.

88
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,660
That was a perfect example of how the passenger recovery plan worked.

89
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,620
The quick response and defined plan helped the airline get passengers out safely and

90
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,620
quickly.

91
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,580
Now, because of this solid engine reliability, numerous redundancies, and well-designed passenger

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,340
recovery plans, airlines and airplanes can now receive some insane ETOP certifications.

93
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:16,280
The 787 Dreamliner, the plane that diverted to Cold Bay, has a type rating of 330 minutes.

94
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,220
That means it can fly up to five and a half hours away from a diversion airport.

95
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,100
Modern routes over long ocean stretches in the southern hemisphere were theoretically

96
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,340
possible in the past with four-engine planes, but were economically impossible since airlines

97
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:35,860
could never fill the large planes on the low-demand city pairs like Melbourne to Santiago.

98
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:42,380
With the ETOPS 330 certification, LATAM Airlines can fly their small 787 economically on this

99
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,680
relatively low-demand route across the South Pacific.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,360
The Airbus A350 is even rated for ETOPS 370, it can fly six hours and ten minutes away

101
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,160
from diversion airports.

102
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,920
This plane can therefore fly everywhere on earth except directly over the South Pole.

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,400
Because of this simple rule change, three and four-engine planes are largely a relic

104
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
of the past.

105
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Boeing and Airbus' largest jets are both their only four-engine planes in production—the

106
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,840
747 and A380.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,600
The all-North Atlantic traffic today is on twin-engine planes as smaller and smaller

108
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,000
planes get ETOPS certifications.

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Air Canada, for example, flies their tiny 120-passenger A319 with ETOPS certification

110
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,060
daily between St. John's Airport and London Heathrow.

111
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:36,240
British Airways even sends the even smaller A318 between New York and London City Airport.

112
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,840
These routes would have been unimaginable 30 years ago, but the reliability of the airplanes

113
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,640
of today mean that we need not fear flying small planes over big oceans.

114
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,920
This video was made possible by Hover.

115
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,120
I talked last time about how Hover is a fantastic way to get a unique domain just like my new

116
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,280
Wendover.Productions domain, but I want to stress this time just how professional a custom

117
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,560
email address is.

118
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,260
For $5 for the entire year, I set up an email ending in "@Wendover.Productions to forward

119
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,020
to my existing business email."

120
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,820
Not only is this email much more memorable, it also oozes professionalism.

121
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,620
Surely that's worth the $5 that you'd otherwise spend on one 160th of an ETOPS flight

122
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,380
to London, right?
