00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,700
Supersonic speed, modular cabin design, all electric power, transparent cabin walls, pilotless

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,140
planes, personal jets for everyone—that all sounds great, but what's actually the

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,740
plane of the future?

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,840
In the next 15-20 years, what will be the next major aircraft release to make an impact

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,840
on the industry?

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,220
Well, it's not nearly as exciting as those concepts—at least for passengers.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,020
More and more people travel by plane each year and the industry is only growing.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,260
In recent years the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has made a significant impact on the airline

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,260
industry.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,500
This relatively small, super-efficient, long-range airplane has allowed for the advent of long-haul

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:53,340
budget airlines and for traditional airlines to open up long-haul routes between smaller

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
markets.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,720
Now, the near future of aviation has a lot to do with one decision Boeing made almost

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,200
a decade ago—a decision they've been regretting ever since.

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,600
In 1983, the first Boeing 757 entered into service with Eastern Airlines.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,560
It was billed as a replacement to the successful 727 for popular shorter routes that needed

19
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,900
more seats than a 737.

20
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:23,240
At the time it was incredibly fuel efficient, burning 40% less fuel per seat than its predecessor.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,900
It sold well, but not phenomenally.

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,400
By the turn of the millennium about a thousand were made and sales were slowing rapidly so

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,160
Boeing pulled the plug on the aircraft's production in 2004.

24
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,400
But then, in 2007, the aircraft started to be used for something it wasn't intended

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,840
for—Transatlantic service.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,220
When the 757 was originally developed airlines weren't really allowed to fly twin-engined

27
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,520
aircraft over long stretches of ocean, but the regulations changed so airlines changed

28
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,040
how they used the plane.

29
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,440
With a range of well over 4,000 miles, the 757 can easily reach most destinations in

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,280
Western Europe from the US east coast.

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
When operating a smaller plane, airlines are almost guaranteed that they can fill the seats

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,960
so they're almost guaranteed to make money so, instead of operating larger planes that

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,020
might not fill up, airlines started flying this single-aisle, twin-engined plane across

34
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,020
the Atlantic.

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,340
The smaller size also allowed airlines to fly to smaller destinations with smaller demand.

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,380
United, for example, flies these planes on routes like New York to Shannon, Birmingham,

37
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,620
Edinburgh, Lisbon, and Stockholm.

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,920
At the same time, since the plane was originally developed for domestic routes it can easily

39
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,120
be used for shorter domestic flights between transatlantic flights which leads to high

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,540
aircraft utilization—a key to profitability.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,740
But these planes are getting old.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:52,200
Some have been in service for well over 30 years and airlines need to retire them to

43
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,940
remain competitive both with passenger comfort and aircraft efficiency and right now, nobody

44
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:01,280
really knows what's going to replace these aging 757s.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,300
There's a huge gap in the market.

46
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,700
The biggest Boeing single-aisle aircraft in production is the 737 MAX 10 while the smallest

47
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,500
twin-aisle aircraft is the 787-8 Dreamliner.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:19,260
In an all-economy configuration the MAX 10 carries 230 passengers while the Dreamliner

49
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,100
carries 359 passengers.

50
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:29,120
Meanwhile the MAX 10 can fly up to 3,700 miles while the Dreamliner can fly up to 8,300 miles.

51
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,780
At between 230 and 280 passengers and up to 4,000 nautical miles, the 757 perfectly fits

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,200
between the two sizes but we need a plane of the future for this middle spot.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Neither Boeing or Airbus has officially announced plans for a middle of the market plane but

54
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,860
it's almost certain that the next entirely new plane to hit the market will be in this

55
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,560
sweet spot of size.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,380
Boeing tried to hurriedly make a plane this size with the 737 MAX program but many traditional

57
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,260
airlines aren't buying it.

58
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,920
Budget airlines love using it to serve between the British Isles and US East Coast but the

59
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,840
largest 737 MAX can only fly up to 3,700 miles—only barely reaching continental Europe

60
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
from New York.

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,000
United, Delta, and American Airlines all want a longer range and slightly larger plane for

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,800
their low-demand transatlantic routes.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
So here's the good news—this plane is coming.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,760
There have only been trickles of information but we've all but confirmed that the Boeing

65
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:38,000
797 will be a brand new plane between the size of the 737 and the 787 and here's what

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
it will look like.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,580
It will have between 225 and 260 seats and a range of just shy of 6,000 miles—enough

68
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,820
to get even to the American west coast from London.

69
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,600
While the increased range of the 737 MAX planes is allowing transatlantic service from smaller

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,280
cities in the British Isles and American East Coast, this 797 will open transatlantic service

71
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,040
from cities deeper into the continents along with replacing the aging 757s.

72
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,560
With super-efficient engines and composite design, it will be one of the most efficient

73
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,880
planes yet and further drive down the cost of hopping the pond.

74
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,860
Meanwhile, Airbus is doing nothing, because they already tried.

75
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:26,120
The Airbus A310 was exactly the size of this potential 797 but they only sold 250 of them.

76
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,420
It was likely before its time.

77
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:32,420
Starbucks just didn't consider serving long-haul routes between smaller markets at

78
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,420
the time.

79
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,900
It's a newer concept.

80
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:42,300
Ironically, the best replacement for the Boeing 757 is actually an Airbus plane—the A321neo

81
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,300
Long Range.

82
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,740
But this plane is a bit too small to serve as a true replacement.

83
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,380
It's more a temporary solution until Boeing releases their solution.

84
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:57,360
As of now, the 797 would most likely enter service in 2025 so it will be a while until

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
we know which manufacturer chose correctly.

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,880
But what's next?

87
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,780
After completing their entire ranges of aircraft sizes, what will Boeing and Airbus make to

88
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,400
remain competitive?

89
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
Right now oil prices are low so there's less pressure to operate greener aircraft,

90
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,360
but most analysts predict a doubling of oil prices in the next 20 to 30 years with ever

91
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,720
faster increases after that.

92
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,960
The industry will need to adapt to stay alive against the potential future threat of high-speed

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,920
land-based transportation systems like Hyperloop.

94
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,760
For that, electric is the answer.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,680
Fuel is airlines number one cost and cutting that out would make flying competitive in

96
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,040
price to taking the bus but electric aircraft have their limitations.

97
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,440
Current batteries are heavy and electric engines are weak so electric aircraft are limited

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,960
in speed and range but there's a place for that kind of aircraft—on regional routes.

99
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,080
Airlines currently dominate the 200 to 400 mile transportation market.

100
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,600
Think DC to New York, Edinburgh to London, or Tokyo to Osaka.

101
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,240
There's just no way that the plane can beat the train in terms of price, convenience,

102
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,780
and time, but the electric aircraft has the potential to beat the train on the most important

103
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,400
of those three factors—price.

104
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:16,240
By offering a transportation option at roughly the same cost but significantly faster than

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,640
the bus, electric aircraft will have the potential to dominate the short-haul market because

106
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,520
on shorter routes, aircraft speed doesn't really matter.

107
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,360
On flights so short, aircraft barely get up to their top speeds.

108
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,660
Both British Airways and Flybe operate the Edinburgh to London Heathrow route, for example,

109
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:42,280
but British Airways uses A320 and 767 jets while Flybe uses Bombardier Dash 8 turboprops.

110
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,640
British Airways flies this route in an average 79 minutes while Flybe, with their slower

111
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,200
turboprop planes, flies between Edinburgh and London Heathrow in a faster 73 minutes

112
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
on average.

113
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,800
British Airways' A320 has a top speed of 541 miles per hour while Flybe's Dash 8

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,760
has a top speed of 370 miles per hour and yet the turboprop flies the route faster.

115
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:11,080
On such a short route, the low speed of an electric airplane wouldn't matter since

116
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,560
aircraft can't get up to speed and the dramatic cost reduction would make airplanes the absolute

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,360
dominant transportation method in short-haul markets.

118
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,640
Airbus is the current market leader in electric aircraft development with a goal to release

119
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,320
a hybrid commuter aircraft by 2030 but as the reality of a world without oil nears,

120
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,440
Boeing will likely start more serious development of an electric aircraft in the coming years.

121
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,400
None of this is to say that we will never see some of the more exciting future aircraft

122
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,080
concepts but the entire aviation industry is dictated by economics, not comfort.

123
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:50,200
It's a lot easier for airlines to market lower prices than it is for them to sell higher

124
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,140
comfort so more efficient aircraft will always win.

125
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,280
With the completion of a middle of the market airplane, however, the entire range of aircraft

126
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,400
sizes will be filled in a way that might allow the aircraft manufacturers to turn their focus

127
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,480
to developing more novel aircraft concepts that will change the way we fly in the future.

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,680
The good news is that these aircraft developments are all about making flying cheaper which

129
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,440
will let more and more people fly for less.

130
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,240
If you have a business, a youtube channel, a podcast, or really anything else you need

131
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
