00:09.060 --> 00:14.700
Supersonic speed, modular cabin design, all electric power, transparent cabin walls, pilotless

00:14.700 --> 00:19.140
planes, personal jets for everyone—that all sounds great, but what's actually the

00:19.140 --> 00:20.740
plane of the future?

00:20.740 --> 00:25.840
In the next 15-20 years, what will be the next major aircraft release to make an impact

00:25.840 --> 00:26.840
on the industry?

00:26.860 --> 00:32.220
Well, it's not nearly as exciting as those concepts—at least for passengers.

00:32.220 --> 00:37.020
More and more people travel by plane each year and the industry is only growing.

00:37.020 --> 00:42.260
In recent years the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has made a significant impact on the airline

00:42.260 --> 00:43.260
industry.

00:43.260 --> 00:48.500
This relatively small, super-efficient, long-range airplane has allowed for the advent of long-haul

00:48.500 --> 00:53.340
budget airlines and for traditional airlines to open up long-haul routes between smaller

00:53.340 --> 00:54.340
markets.

00:54.340 --> 00:59.720
Now, the near future of aviation has a lot to do with one decision Boeing made almost

00:59.720 --> 01:04.200
a decade ago—a decision they've been regretting ever since.

01:04.200 --> 01:09.600
In 1983, the first Boeing 757 entered into service with Eastern Airlines.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.560
It was billed as a replacement to the successful 727 for popular shorter routes that needed

01:14.560 --> 01:16.900
more seats than a 737.

01:16.900 --> 01:23.240
At the time it was incredibly fuel efficient, burning 40% less fuel per seat than its predecessor.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.900
It sold well, but not phenomenally.

01:25.900 --> 01:30.400
By the turn of the millennium about a thousand were made and sales were slowing rapidly so

01:30.400 --> 01:34.160
Boeing pulled the plug on the aircraft's production in 2004.

01:34.160 --> 01:39.400
But then, in 2007, the aircraft started to be used for something it wasn't intended

01:39.400 --> 01:41.840
for—Transatlantic service.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.220
When the 757 was originally developed airlines weren't really allowed to fly twin-engined

01:47.220 --> 01:52.520
aircraft over long stretches of ocean, but the regulations changed so airlines changed

01:52.520 --> 01:54.040
how they used the plane.

01:54.040 --> 02:00.440
With a range of well over 4,000 miles, the 757 can easily reach most destinations in

02:00.440 --> 02:03.280
Western Europe from the US east coast.

02:03.280 --> 02:08.080
When operating a smaller plane, airlines are almost guaranteed that they can fill the seats

02:08.080 --> 02:12.960
so they're almost guaranteed to make money so, instead of operating larger planes that

02:12.960 --> 02:18.020
might not fill up, airlines started flying this single-aisle, twin-engined plane across

02:18.020 --> 02:19.020
the Atlantic.

02:19.020 --> 02:24.340
The smaller size also allowed airlines to fly to smaller destinations with smaller demand.

02:24.340 --> 02:29.380
United, for example, flies these planes on routes like New York to Shannon, Birmingham,

02:29.380 --> 02:31.620
Edinburgh, Lisbon, and Stockholm.

02:31.620 --> 02:36.920
At the same time, since the plane was originally developed for domestic routes it can easily

02:36.920 --> 02:42.120
be used for shorter domestic flights between transatlantic flights which leads to high

02:42.120 --> 02:45.540
aircraft utilization—a key to profitability.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.740
But these planes are getting old.

02:47.740 --> 02:52.200
Some have been in service for well over 30 years and airlines need to retire them to

02:52.200 --> 02:57.940
remain competitive both with passenger comfort and aircraft efficiency and right now, nobody

02:57.940 --> 03:01.280
really knows what's going to replace these aging 757s.

03:01.280 --> 03:04.300
There's a huge gap in the market.

03:04.300 --> 03:09.700
The biggest Boeing single-aisle aircraft in production is the 737 MAX 10 while the smallest

03:09.700 --> 03:13.500
twin-aisle aircraft is the 787-8 Dreamliner.

03:13.500 --> 03:19.260
In an all-economy configuration the MAX 10 carries 230 passengers while the Dreamliner

03:19.260 --> 03:22.100
carries 359 passengers.

03:22.100 --> 03:29.120
Meanwhile the MAX 10 can fly up to 3,700 miles while the Dreamliner can fly up to 8,300 miles.

03:29.120 --> 03:36.780
At between 230 and 280 passengers and up to 4,000 nautical miles, the 757 perfectly fits

03:36.780 --> 03:42.200
between the two sizes but we need a plane of the future for this middle spot.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.200
Neither Boeing or Airbus has officially announced plans for a middle of the market plane but

03:47.200 --> 03:51.860
it's almost certain that the next entirely new plane to hit the market will be in this

03:51.860 --> 03:53.560
sweet spot of size.

03:53.560 --> 03:59.380
Boeing tried to hurriedly make a plane this size with the 737 MAX program but many traditional

03:59.380 --> 04:01.260
airlines aren't buying it.

04:01.260 --> 04:05.920
Budget airlines love using it to serve between the British Isles and US East Coast but the

04:05.920 --> 04:12.840
largest 737 MAX can only fly up to 3,700 miles—only barely reaching continental Europe

04:12.840 --> 04:13.840
from New York.

04:13.840 --> 04:20.000
United, Delta, and American Airlines all want a longer range and slightly larger plane for

04:20.000 --> 04:22.800
their low-demand transatlantic routes.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.160
So here's the good news—this plane is coming.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.760
There have only been trickles of information but we've all but confirmed that the Boeing

04:30.760 --> 04:38.000
797 will be a brand new plane between the size of the 737 and the 787 and here's what

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
it will look like.

04:39.000 --> 04:46.580
It will have between 225 and 260 seats and a range of just shy of 6,000 miles—enough

04:46.580 --> 04:49.820
to get even to the American west coast from London.

04:49.820 --> 04:54.600
While the increased range of the 737 MAX planes is allowing transatlantic service from smaller

04:54.600 --> 05:00.280
cities in the British Isles and American East Coast, this 797 will open transatlantic service

05:00.280 --> 05:06.040
from cities deeper into the continents along with replacing the aging 757s.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.560
With super-efficient engines and composite design, it will be one of the most efficient

05:10.560 --> 05:14.880
planes yet and further drive down the cost of hopping the pond.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.860
Meanwhile, Airbus is doing nothing, because they already tried.

05:18.860 --> 05:26.120
The Airbus A310 was exactly the size of this potential 797 but they only sold 250 of them.

05:26.120 --> 05:28.420
It was likely before its time.

05:28.420 --> 05:32.420
Starbucks just didn't consider serving long-haul routes between smaller markets at

05:32.420 --> 05:33.420
the time.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.900
It's a newer concept.

05:34.900 --> 05:42.300
Ironically, the best replacement for the Boeing 757 is actually an Airbus plane—the A321neo

05:42.300 --> 05:43.300
Long Range.

05:43.300 --> 05:46.740
But this plane is a bit too small to serve as a true replacement.

05:46.740 --> 05:51.380
It's more a temporary solution until Boeing releases their solution.

05:51.380 --> 05:57.360
As of now, the 797 would most likely enter service in 2025 so it will be a while until

05:57.360 --> 06:00.400
we know which manufacturer chose correctly.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.880
But what's next?

06:01.880 --> 06:06.780
After completing their entire ranges of aircraft sizes, what will Boeing and Airbus make to

06:06.780 --> 06:08.400
remain competitive?

06:08.400 --> 06:12.880
Right now oil prices are low so there's less pressure to operate greener aircraft,

06:12.880 --> 06:18.360
but most analysts predict a doubling of oil prices in the next 20 to 30 years with ever

06:18.360 --> 06:20.720
faster increases after that.

06:20.720 --> 06:25.960
The industry will need to adapt to stay alive against the potential future threat of high-speed

06:25.960 --> 06:28.920
land-based transportation systems like Hyperloop.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.760
For that, electric is the answer.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.680
Fuel is airlines number one cost and cutting that out would make flying competitive in

06:36.680 --> 06:42.040
price to taking the bus but electric aircraft have their limitations.

06:42.040 --> 06:46.440
Current batteries are heavy and electric engines are weak so electric aircraft are limited

06:46.440 --> 06:51.960
in speed and range but there's a place for that kind of aircraft—on regional routes.

06:51.960 --> 06:56.080
Airlines currently dominate the 200 to 400 mile transportation market.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.600
Think DC to New York, Edinburgh to London, or Tokyo to Osaka.

06:59.600 --> 07:04.240
There's just no way that the plane can beat the train in terms of price, convenience,

07:04.240 --> 07:08.780
and time, but the electric aircraft has the potential to beat the train on the most important

07:08.780 --> 07:11.400
of those three factors—price.

07:11.400 --> 07:16.240
By offering a transportation option at roughly the same cost but significantly faster than

07:16.240 --> 07:21.640
the bus, electric aircraft will have the potential to dominate the short-haul market because

07:21.640 --> 07:25.520
on shorter routes, aircraft speed doesn't really matter.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.360
On flights so short, aircraft barely get up to their top speeds.

07:29.360 --> 07:34.660
Both British Airways and Flybe operate the Edinburgh to London Heathrow route, for example,

07:34.660 --> 07:42.280
but British Airways uses A320 and 767 jets while Flybe uses Bombardier Dash 8 turboprops.

07:42.280 --> 07:47.640
British Airways flies this route in an average 79 minutes while Flybe, with their slower

07:47.640 --> 07:53.200
turboprop planes, flies between Edinburgh and London Heathrow in a faster 73 minutes

07:53.200 --> 07:54.200
on average.

07:54.200 --> 08:00.800
British Airways' A320 has a top speed of 541 miles per hour while Flybe's Dash 8

08:00.800 --> 08:06.760
has a top speed of 370 miles per hour and yet the turboprop flies the route faster.

08:06.760 --> 08:11.080
On such a short route, the low speed of an electric airplane wouldn't matter since

08:11.080 --> 08:16.560
aircraft can't get up to speed and the dramatic cost reduction would make airplanes the absolute

08:16.600 --> 08:20.360
dominant transportation method in short-haul markets.

08:20.360 --> 08:24.640
Airbus is the current market leader in electric aircraft development with a goal to release

08:24.640 --> 08:30.320
a hybrid commuter aircraft by 2030 but as the reality of a world without oil nears,

08:30.320 --> 08:35.440
Boeing will likely start more serious development of an electric aircraft in the coming years.

08:35.440 --> 08:39.400
None of this is to say that we will never see some of the more exciting future aircraft

08:39.400 --> 08:45.080
concepts but the entire aviation industry is dictated by economics, not comfort.

08:45.080 --> 08:50.200
It's a lot easier for airlines to market lower prices than it is for them to sell higher

08:50.200 --> 08:54.140
comfort so more efficient aircraft will always win.

08:54.140 --> 08:58.280
With the completion of a middle of the market airplane, however, the entire range of aircraft

08:58.280 --> 09:03.400
sizes will be filled in a way that might allow the aircraft manufacturers to turn their focus

09:03.400 --> 09:08.480
to developing more novel aircraft concepts that will change the way we fly in the future.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.680
The good news is that these aircraft developments are all about making flying cheaper which

09:12.680 --> 09:16.440
will let more and more people fly for less.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.240
If you have a business, a youtube channel, a podcast, or really anything else you need
