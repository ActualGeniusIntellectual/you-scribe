9060	14700	Supersonic speed, modular cabin design, all electric power, transparent cabin walls, pilotless
14700	19140	planes, personal jets for everyone—that all sounds great, but what's actually the
19140	20740	plane of the future?
20740	25840	In the next 15-20 years, what will be the next major aircraft release to make an impact
25840	26840	on the industry?
26860	32220	Well, it's not nearly as exciting as those concepts—at least for passengers.
32220	37020	More and more people travel by plane each year and the industry is only growing.
37020	42260	In recent years the Boeing 787 Dreamliner has made a significant impact on the airline
42260	43260	industry.
43260	48500	This relatively small, super-efficient, long-range airplane has allowed for the advent of long-haul
48500	53340	budget airlines and for traditional airlines to open up long-haul routes between smaller
53340	54340	markets.
54340	59720	Now, the near future of aviation has a lot to do with one decision Boeing made almost
59720	64200	a decade ago—a decision they've been regretting ever since.
64200	69600	In 1983, the first Boeing 757 entered into service with Eastern Airlines.
69600	74560	It was billed as a replacement to the successful 727 for popular shorter routes that needed
74560	76900	more seats than a 737.
76900	83240	At the time it was incredibly fuel efficient, burning 40% less fuel per seat than its predecessor.
83240	85900	It sold well, but not phenomenally.
85900	90400	By the turn of the millennium about a thousand were made and sales were slowing rapidly so
90400	94160	Boeing pulled the plug on the aircraft's production in 2004.
94160	99400	But then, in 2007, the aircraft started to be used for something it wasn't intended
99400	101840	for—Transatlantic service.
101840	107220	When the 757 was originally developed airlines weren't really allowed to fly twin-engined
107220	112520	aircraft over long stretches of ocean, but the regulations changed so airlines changed
112520	114040	how they used the plane.
114040	120440	With a range of well over 4,000 miles, the 757 can easily reach most destinations in
120440	123280	Western Europe from the US east coast.
123280	128080	When operating a smaller plane, airlines are almost guaranteed that they can fill the seats
128080	132960	so they're almost guaranteed to make money so, instead of operating larger planes that
132960	138020	might not fill up, airlines started flying this single-aisle, twin-engined plane across
138020	139020	the Atlantic.
139020	144340	The smaller size also allowed airlines to fly to smaller destinations with smaller demand.
144340	149380	United, for example, flies these planes on routes like New York to Shannon, Birmingham,
149380	151620	Edinburgh, Lisbon, and Stockholm.
151620	156920	At the same time, since the plane was originally developed for domestic routes it can easily
156920	162120	be used for shorter domestic flights between transatlantic flights which leads to high
162120	165540	aircraft utilization—a key to profitability.
165540	167740	But these planes are getting old.
167740	172200	Some have been in service for well over 30 years and airlines need to retire them to
172200	177940	remain competitive both with passenger comfort and aircraft efficiency and right now, nobody
177940	181280	really knows what's going to replace these aging 757s.
181280	184300	There's a huge gap in the market.
184300	189700	The biggest Boeing single-aisle aircraft in production is the 737 MAX 10 while the smallest
189700	193500	twin-aisle aircraft is the 787-8 Dreamliner.
193500	199260	In an all-economy configuration the MAX 10 carries 230 passengers while the Dreamliner
199260	202100	carries 359 passengers.
202100	209120	Meanwhile the MAX 10 can fly up to 3,700 miles while the Dreamliner can fly up to 8,300 miles.
209120	216780	At between 230 and 280 passengers and up to 4,000 nautical miles, the 757 perfectly fits
216780	222200	between the two sizes but we need a plane of the future for this middle spot.
222200	227200	Neither Boeing or Airbus has officially announced plans for a middle of the market plane but
227200	231860	it's almost certain that the next entirely new plane to hit the market will be in this
231860	233560	sweet spot of size.
233560	239380	Boeing tried to hurriedly make a plane this size with the 737 MAX program but many traditional
239380	241260	airlines aren't buying it.
241260	245920	Budget airlines love using it to serve between the British Isles and US East Coast but the
245920	252840	largest 737 MAX can only fly up to 3,700 miles—only barely reaching continental Europe
252840	253840	from New York.
253840	260000	United, Delta, and American Airlines all want a longer range and slightly larger plane for
260000	262800	their low-demand transatlantic routes.
262800	266160	So here's the good news—this plane is coming.
266160	270760	There have only been trickles of information but we've all but confirmed that the Boeing
270760	278000	797 will be a brand new plane between the size of the 737 and the 787 and here's what
278000	279000	it will look like.
279000	286580	It will have between 225 and 260 seats and a range of just shy of 6,000 miles—enough
286580	289820	to get even to the American west coast from London.
289820	294600	While the increased range of the 737 MAX planes is allowing transatlantic service from smaller
294600	300280	cities in the British Isles and American East Coast, this 797 will open transatlantic service
300280	306040	from cities deeper into the continents along with replacing the aging 757s.
306040	310560	With super-efficient engines and composite design, it will be one of the most efficient
310560	314880	planes yet and further drive down the cost of hopping the pond.
314880	318860	Meanwhile, Airbus is doing nothing, because they already tried.
318860	326120	The Airbus A310 was exactly the size of this potential 797 but they only sold 250 of them.
326120	328420	It was likely before its time.
328420	332420	Starbucks just didn't consider serving long-haul routes between smaller markets at
332420	333420	the time.
333420	334900	It's a newer concept.
334900	342300	Ironically, the best replacement for the Boeing 757 is actually an Airbus plane—the A321neo
342300	343300	Long Range.
343300	346740	But this plane is a bit too small to serve as a true replacement.
346740	351380	It's more a temporary solution until Boeing releases their solution.
351380	357360	As of now, the 797 would most likely enter service in 2025 so it will be a while until
357360	360400	we know which manufacturer chose correctly.
360400	361880	But what's next?
361880	366780	After completing their entire ranges of aircraft sizes, what will Boeing and Airbus make to
366780	368400	remain competitive?
368400	372880	Right now oil prices are low so there's less pressure to operate greener aircraft,
372880	378360	but most analysts predict a doubling of oil prices in the next 20 to 30 years with ever
378360	380720	faster increases after that.
380720	385960	The industry will need to adapt to stay alive against the potential future threat of high-speed
385960	388920	land-based transportation systems like Hyperloop.
388920	391760	For that, electric is the answer.
391760	396680	Fuel is airlines number one cost and cutting that out would make flying competitive in
396680	402040	price to taking the bus but electric aircraft have their limitations.
402040	406440	Current batteries are heavy and electric engines are weak so electric aircraft are limited
406440	411960	in speed and range but there's a place for that kind of aircraft—on regional routes.
411960	416080	Airlines currently dominate the 200 to 400 mile transportation market.
416080	419600	Think DC to New York, Edinburgh to London, or Tokyo to Osaka.
419600	424240	There's just no way that the plane can beat the train in terms of price, convenience,
424240	428780	and time, but the electric aircraft has the potential to beat the train on the most important
428780	431400	of those three factors—price.
431400	436240	By offering a transportation option at roughly the same cost but significantly faster than
436240	441640	the bus, electric aircraft will have the potential to dominate the short-haul market because
441640	445520	on shorter routes, aircraft speed doesn't really matter.
445520	449360	On flights so short, aircraft barely get up to their top speeds.
449360	454660	Both British Airways and Flybe operate the Edinburgh to London Heathrow route, for example,
454660	462280	but British Airways uses A320 and 767 jets while Flybe uses Bombardier Dash 8 turboprops.
462280	467640	British Airways flies this route in an average 79 minutes while Flybe, with their slower
467640	473200	turboprop planes, flies between Edinburgh and London Heathrow in a faster 73 minutes
473200	474200	on average.
474200	480800	British Airways' A320 has a top speed of 541 miles per hour while Flybe's Dash 8
480800	486760	has a top speed of 370 miles per hour and yet the turboprop flies the route faster.
486760	491080	On such a short route, the low speed of an electric airplane wouldn't matter since
491080	496560	aircraft can't get up to speed and the dramatic cost reduction would make airplanes the absolute
496600	500360	dominant transportation method in short-haul markets.
500360	504640	Airbus is the current market leader in electric aircraft development with a goal to release
504640	510320	a hybrid commuter aircraft by 2030 but as the reality of a world without oil nears,
510320	515440	Boeing will likely start more serious development of an electric aircraft in the coming years.
515440	519400	None of this is to say that we will never see some of the more exciting future aircraft
519400	525080	concepts but the entire aviation industry is dictated by economics, not comfort.
525080	530200	It's a lot easier for airlines to market lower prices than it is for them to sell higher
530200	534140	comfort so more efficient aircraft will always win.
534140	538280	With the completion of a middle of the market airplane, however, the entire range of aircraft
538280	543400	sizes will be filled in a way that might allow the aircraft manufacturers to turn their focus
543400	548480	to developing more novel aircraft concepts that will change the way we fly in the future.
548480	552680	The good news is that these aircraft developments are all about making flying cheaper which
552680	556440	will let more and more people fly for less.
