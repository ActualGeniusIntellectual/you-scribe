0	5140	No, the world isn't literally shrinking, but for humans, it kind of is.
5140	10740	Up until 500 years ago, nobody had ever even circumnavigated the globe, but nowadays anyone
10740	14220	can do this in a couple days just by paying a couple thousand dollars.
14220	18580	Therefore, in the perspective of today's humans, the world is much smaller than it
18580	20160	used to be.
20160	24440	In the time that it took for the first circumnavigation of the world, today's humans could fly to
24440	26680	Mars and back twice.
26680	32240	Think about this, to today's human, the moon seems significantly closer than America
32240	36800	seemed to Europeans in the 16th century when the first voyages departed.
36800	41680	It only takes humans three days to go to the moon, versus over two months for the colonists
41680	43420	to go to America.
43420	49280	Up until 1693, nobody had ever been able to circumnavigate the globe as a tourist, as
49280	52680	in paying for their own transit on public transport.
52680	58000	Gemelli Carrere was the first person to do this feat and it took him five years.
58000	62040	David Springbet has the current record for this accomplishment with his journey from
62040	70120	Los Angeles to London to Bahrain to Singapore to Bangkok to Manila to Tokyo to Honolulu
70120	74640	then back to Los Angeles in 44 hours and 6 minutes.
74640	79840	In 1800, you couldn't even get from New York to DC in those 44 hours.
80140	85720	Between the years of 1857 and 1930, the time it took to cross the United States went from
85720	90360	about three or four weeks to one day.
90360	94160	Not only has the time of travel plummeted, but the accessibility has too.
94160	98240	46% of Americans will travel outside of the US in their lifetime.
98240	102640	Adjusted for inflation, the average cost of domestic air travel in the US has dropped
102640	106080	by more than 50% in just the last 30 years.
106440	115740	50 years ago, only 20% of Americans had ever flown on an airplane, but today only 20% haven't.
115740	117600	In some ways, this may be saddening.
117600	118960	There's less to explore.
118960	123080	There are pretty much no places left on earth that are inaccessible to the average human
123080	124300	being.
124300	129280	One can travel to every continent, every ocean, every country with relative ease.
129280	133480	However, this does mean that practically anyone with a thirst of adventure can visit every
133480	136420	continent, ocean, or country.
136420	140960	In the coming years, we will have even more to explore as we look up to the stars and
140960	141960	leave earth.
141960	146400	We can already buy our tickets to go to outer space, and although it might not be feasible
146400	150880	for the everyday human to buy their ticket now, just look how fast the price of air travel
150880	151880	plummeted.
151880	156400	By the end of our lifetimes, going to the moon might just be as easy as flying to Europe.
