00:00.000 --> 00:05.140
No, the world isn't literally shrinking, but for humans, it kind of is.

00:05.140 --> 00:10.740
Up until 500 years ago, nobody had ever even circumnavigated the globe, but nowadays anyone

00:10.740 --> 00:14.220
can do this in a couple days just by paying a couple thousand dollars.

00:14.220 --> 00:18.580
Therefore, in the perspective of today's humans, the world is much smaller than it

00:18.580 --> 00:20.160
used to be.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.440
In the time that it took for the first circumnavigation of the world, today's humans could fly to

00:24.440 --> 00:26.680
Mars and back twice.

00:26.680 --> 00:32.240
Think about this, to today's human, the moon seems significantly closer than America

00:32.240 --> 00:36.800
seemed to Europeans in the 16th century when the first voyages departed.

00:36.800 --> 00:41.680
It only takes humans three days to go to the moon, versus over two months for the colonists

00:41.680 --> 00:43.420
to go to America.

00:43.420 --> 00:49.280
Up until 1693, nobody had ever been able to circumnavigate the globe as a tourist, as

00:49.280 --> 00:52.680
in paying for their own transit on public transport.

00:52.680 --> 00:58.000
Gemelli Carrere was the first person to do this feat and it took him five years.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.040
David Springbet has the current record for this accomplishment with his journey from

01:02.040 --> 01:10.120
Los Angeles to London to Bahrain to Singapore to Bangkok to Manila to Tokyo to Honolulu

01:10.120 --> 01:14.640
then back to Los Angeles in 44 hours and 6 minutes.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.840
In 1800, you couldn't even get from New York to DC in those 44 hours.

01:20.140 --> 01:25.720
Between the years of 1857 and 1930, the time it took to cross the United States went from

01:25.720 --> 01:30.360
about three or four weeks to one day.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.160
Not only has the time of travel plummeted, but the accessibility has too.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.240
46% of Americans will travel outside of the US in their lifetime.

01:38.240 --> 01:42.640
Adjusted for inflation, the average cost of domestic air travel in the US has dropped

01:42.640 --> 01:46.080
by more than 50% in just the last 30 years.

01:46.440 --> 01:55.740
50 years ago, only 20% of Americans had ever flown on an airplane, but today only 20% haven't.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.600
In some ways, this may be saddening.

01:57.600 --> 01:58.960
There's less to explore.

01:58.960 --> 02:03.080
There are pretty much no places left on earth that are inaccessible to the average human

02:03.080 --> 02:04.300
being.

02:04.300 --> 02:09.280
One can travel to every continent, every ocean, every country with relative ease.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.480
However, this does mean that practically anyone with a thirst of adventure can visit every

02:13.480 --> 02:16.420
continent, ocean, or country.

02:16.420 --> 02:20.960
In the coming years, we will have even more to explore as we look up to the stars and

02:20.960 --> 02:21.960
leave earth.

02:21.960 --> 02:26.400
We can already buy our tickets to go to outer space, and although it might not be feasible

02:26.400 --> 02:30.880
for the everyday human to buy their ticket now, just look how fast the price of air travel

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
plummeted.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.400
By the end of our lifetimes, going to the moon might just be as easy as flying to Europe.
