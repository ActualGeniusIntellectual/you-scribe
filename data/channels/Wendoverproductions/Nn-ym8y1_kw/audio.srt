1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,140
No, the world isn't literally shrinking, but for humans, it kind of is.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:10,740
Up until 500 years ago, nobody had ever even circumnavigated the globe, but nowadays anyone

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,220
can do this in a couple days just by paying a couple thousand dollars.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:18,580
Therefore, in the perspective of today's humans, the world is much smaller than it

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,160
used to be.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,440
In the time that it took for the first circumnavigation of the world, today's humans could fly to

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,680
Mars and back twice.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,240
Think about this, to today's human, the moon seems significantly closer than America

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,800
seemed to Europeans in the 16th century when the first voyages departed.

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,680
It only takes humans three days to go to the moon, versus over two months for the colonists

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,420
to go to America.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:49,280
Up until 1693, nobody had ever been able to circumnavigate the globe as a tourist, as

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,680
in paying for their own transit on public transport.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,000
Gemelli Carrere was the first person to do this feat and it took him five years.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,040
David Springbet has the current record for this accomplishment with his journey from

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Los Angeles to London to Bahrain to Singapore to Bangkok to Manila to Tokyo to Honolulu

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,640
then back to Los Angeles in 44 hours and 6 minutes.

18
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,840
In 1800, you couldn't even get from New York to DC in those 44 hours.

19
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,720
Between the years of 1857 and 1930, the time it took to cross the United States went from

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,360
about three or four weeks to one day.

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,160
Not only has the time of travel plummeted, but the accessibility has too.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,240
46% of Americans will travel outside of the US in their lifetime.

23
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,640
Adjusted for inflation, the average cost of domestic air travel in the US has dropped

24
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,080
by more than 50% in just the last 30 years.

25
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:55,740
50 years ago, only 20% of Americans had ever flown on an airplane, but today only 20% haven't.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,600
In some ways, this may be saddening.

27
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,960
There's less to explore.

28
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,080
There are pretty much no places left on earth that are inaccessible to the average human

29
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,300
being.

30
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:09,280
One can travel to every continent, every ocean, every country with relative ease.

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,480
However, this does mean that practically anyone with a thirst of adventure can visit every

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,420
continent, ocean, or country.

33
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,960
In the coming years, we will have even more to explore as we look up to the stars and

34
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
leave earth.

35
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,400
We can already buy our tickets to go to outer space, and although it might not be feasible

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,880
for the everyday human to buy their ticket now, just look how fast the price of air travel

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
plummeted.

38
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,400
By the end of our lifetimes, going to the moon might just be as easy as flying to Europe.
