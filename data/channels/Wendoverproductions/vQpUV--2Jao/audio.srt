1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
To a certain, slightly uninformed expert, this Dollar General, in Faith, South Dakota,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,680
would seem an economic impossibility disproven only by its existence.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,080
Faith is a tiny place—a remote, no-stoplight prairie town of 367.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,820
It's got a couple of gas stations and a couple of inns and restaurants and an auto

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,120
parts store, but what it doesn't have is a single nationwide brand.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,500
It doesn't have a single branch of any store, restaurant, or service that exists beyond

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,560
the region around, except for Dollar General.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,460
But that doesn't explain the full extent of the anomaly, because Dollar General isn't

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,760
just the only chain in Faith, it's the only chain in a 45-minute radius until one arrives

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,380
at this Dairy Queen in the far larger, 3,000-person tribal capital of Eagle Butte.

11
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:54,280
A 367-person population just isn't typically enough to attract a nationwide brand—there's

12
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,420
just not enough money in the area to make capturing it attractive—and yet somehow,

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,140
Dollar General makes it work.

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,420
While perhaps an extreme example, there's no secret about Faith.

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,300
It's not some tourist mecca, it's not an interstate oasis, it does sit at the intersection

16
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:15,380
between a state and US highway, but it's not on the fastest route between any two cities,

17
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,820
so this store, somehow, is sustained by the tiny community that surrounds it.

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,140
This is anomalous in the context of national retailers, but not in the context of Dollar

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,140
General.

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,260
They're consistently persistent in places simply too small for other chains.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,060
Its next nearest location to the north is in a town of 1,200, to the east 1,100, and

22
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,300
to the south and west 540 and 590, respectively.

23
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,180
Walmart is also one of the most regular retailers in rural America, but they don't even come

24
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,780
close to these numbers.

25
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,620
There's no way to know for sure which are their lowest-traffic stores, and therefore

26
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:56,820
what the minimum population that can support their economics is, but by letting the quantity

27
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,900
of Google reviews act as an imperfect proxy, their location in Gunnison emerges as Colorado's

28
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,620
least popular location.

29
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,740
6,700 live within a 20 minute driving radius of this store, but revenue is likely buoyed

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,860
by its positioning at the start of the dead-end highway up to the tourist town of Crested

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,860
Butte.

32
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,940
Similarly, Wyoming's least popular Walmart is its outpost in Rawlings, with a 6,300 person

33
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,620
population within the same radius, but once again its revenue is likely boosted by its

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,360
location along Interstate 80.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,500
So perhaps the best evidence of the minimum population to support the retailer's economics

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,220
comes from Alaska, where its least popular store sits on the island of Kodiak.

37
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,980
8,700 people live within a 20 minute radius, and there's clearly no interstate traffic

38
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,020
coming through.

39
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,380
Walmart revolutionized retail through its ability to turn a profit in small remote communities

40
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,460
like Kodiak, its impact decimated the American Main Street, but Dollar General has taken

41
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,900
that to a new extreme.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,040
Where Walmart entrenches itself in the thousands, Dollar General deals in the hundreds.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,300
This revolutionary retail concept starts on the inside.

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,700
Total staff headcount at a given location typically sits between six and ten, and of

45
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,900
those, just two or three might work at a given time.

46
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,980
Given typical hourly rates and typical opening hours, that means Dollar General can spend

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,700
as little as three to four hundred dollars a day staffing their lowest traffic stores.

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,300
Then there's product offering complexity.

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,020
A Walmart averages 140,000 unique products.

50
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,700
They'll sell Coke in 10-count mini cans, 30-count mini cans, 12-count full-size cans,

51
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,860
24-count full-size cans, 12-count mini bottles, 6-count full-size bottles, 12-count full-size

52
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,340
bottles, 1-count 2-liter bottles, 4-count 4-liter bottles, and then they'll offer

53
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,980
all these sizes for Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, and then they'll offer this

54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,260
same spread for every other soda brand and its variants, which is incredibly convenient.

55
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,700
They have the exact soda, variant, bottle size, type, and quantity that any given person

56
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,460
wants, but the permutations really add up.

57
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,540
More individual products require a more complex supply chain, more floor space, and added

58
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,100
staffing dedicated to organization, which adds to cost for the retailer.

59
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,500
Dollar General, meanwhile, keeps it simple.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,240
They offer just 10,000 unique products, but they do this primarily not by reducing how

61
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,680
many product categories they sell, but rather the optionality within each category.

62
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,880
In a way, they're trying to be a mini Walmart, offering a one-stop shop experience, as long

63
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,560
as you're willing to compromise on brand, size, quality, or quantity of a given product.

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,320
So, whereas Walmart has a pan or toilet paper or detergent aisle, Dollar General has a pan,

65
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,880
a toilet paper, or a detergent.

66
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,920
Now, Walmart is likely able to purchase Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble for a fairly

67
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,440
low price because it's the largest retailer in the world and therefore has very strong

68
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
negotiating power.

69
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,400
If it were to stop stocking Tide, P&G's revenues would take an enormous hit.

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,660
But correspondingly, given the popularity of Tide, Walmart could take a hit if consumers

71
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,120
decided to go to Target to buy the brand instead.

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,080
Dollar General, meanwhile, has that same enormous negotiating power with their same enormous

73
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,360
size, but crucially, they don't have to stock everything.

74
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,760
Walmart's competitive advantage is that they're the definitive one-stop shop—they

75
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,200
combine the local supermarket, hardware, electronics, home goods, and clothing stores into one.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,580
Dollar General's competitive advantage is that they're the shop—they are the only

77
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,480
game in town and so they just need to offer one brand of laundry detergent and that's

78
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,640
the detergent people will get.

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,120
This bestows enormous negotiating leverage—manufacturers will bend to their whims in order to become

80
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,400
the Dollar General detergent supplier, meaning they might be able to get a similar or even

81
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,080
better deal from P&G on detergent pricing than even Walmart.

82
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,520
That's what leads to products like this—Dollar General's $1 Tide brand detergent.

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,920
To balance the retailer's need for a low-cost offering with their desire to maintain a premium

84
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,880
name-brand image, Procter & Gamble has gone out of their way to manufacture a $1 Tide

85
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,000
detergent bottle.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
Now, Walmart actually sells this same product for less.

87
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,560
Their 128 fluid ounce size works out to under 12 cents per load—almost half of Dollar

88
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,480
General's 20 cents per—but Dollar General's target consumer is one who is severely cash-strapped.

89
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,560
They cater to the class of consumers that might want to spend $10 on bulk detergent

90
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,680
that will last for months, but chooses the $1 option regardless to keep enough cash on

91
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,120
hand to pay rent before their next payday.

92
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,920
So, Dollar General actually charges more per load, and even better, their consumer will

93
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,080
want to come back sooner than Walmart's to buy a refill, at which time they'll also

94
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
buy whatever else they need, therefore extracting more revenue.

95
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,340
But Dollar General's true strategic linchpin is the most anomalous aspect of its business

96
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,360
model—its remote locations.

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,280
The retailer has turned what would be a weakness for others into the core of its strength.

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,840
It starts with cost.

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,080
Rent at this store in North Creek, New York is $118,000 a year, at this store in Sullivan,

100
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,480
Maine, $103,000 a year, and at that faith South Dakota location, $106,000 a year.

101
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,680
That works out to between three and four hundred dollars in rent per day, which, added to their

102
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,800
three or four hundred dollars in daily staffing costs, underpins Dollar General's ability

103
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,380
to run a store with under a thousand dollars of overhead per day.

104
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,400
In general, they just won't set up a location in a place where they'll have to pay over

105
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,480
$150,000 or so in annual rent—it just breaks their low-cost business model.

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,280
But low rent costs are far from the key that unlocks rural America—rather, remoteness

107
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,880
itself enables their remoteness.

108
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
Take their location in Haven, Kansas.

109
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,120
This is a town of 1,170 that simply does not have a grocery store.

110
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,240
They have a gas station and a liquor store and a coffee shop and diner, but they don't

111
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,760
have a grocery store.

112
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,160
Dollar General is not a grocery store, but their locations do stock shelf-stable dry

113
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,600
goods and frozen food, and some sell a limited supply of perishables.

114
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,920
The closest dedicated grocery store is a full ten-minute drive away in the next town, and

115
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,180
it's small—not one that could necessarily fulfill all of a person's needs.

116
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,440
The closest supermarket is a full twenty-two minutes away in the city of Hutchinson, so

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,560
what happens in practice, when Dollar General enters a market like Haven, is that rather

118
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,320
than making that ten or twenty-two minute trip, people shop out of the local Dollar

119
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,500
General for regular day-to-day needs, then make less frequent trips to the distant grocery

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,480
store for fresh and specialty items.

121
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,900
But increasingly, this pattern isn't confined to Dollar General, and it isn't confined

122
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,220
to rural America either.

123
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:38,180
This is Atlanta, Georgia, and the surrounding cities, suburbs, and communities that comprise

124
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,740
much of the broader Atlanta metro area.

125
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,500
This is a map of their most common grocery stores—Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Lidl,

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,560
Publix, Kroger, and Walmart.

127
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,540
They all do the same thing—they all trend north and east.

128
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,540
But people live here, too, and they too need food to eat and stores to buy food to eat.

129
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:03,540
For anyone, this would make grocery shopping more of a pain than it already is.

130
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,300
Making things more difficult, though, this gap of grocery stores is also home to the

131
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,220
metro area's least mobile, as these census tracts contain, in the words of the USDA's

132
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,700
Food Access Atlas, more than a hundred households with no access to a vehicle and are more than

133
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,260
a half mile from the nearest supermarket.

134
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Unsurprisingly, this correlates closely with tracts that are low income, as all these areas

135
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,700
have a poverty rate of over 20%, or a medium family income of less than 80% of the medium

136
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,460
income for the state or metro area.

137
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,980
Put together, Atlanta residents with the least money and least mobility are the farthest

138
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,980
from supermarkets.

139
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,860
Now of course it's not a simple coincidence that some of the poorest and least mobile

140
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,420
populations of Atlanta are farthest from supermarkets.

141
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,540
Businesses after all are areas still grappling with the legacy of redlining in the past,

142
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,900
and areas that some academics have identified as current instances of supermarket redlining—the

143
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:01,080
process by which businesses intentionally keep their distance from such areas for reasons

144
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:05,900
that vary from crime rate and purchasing power to zoning restrictions and unfavorable street

145
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
layouts.

146
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,380
But regardless of their reasons, supermarkets simply don't exist in a large portion of

147
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,740
the Atlanta metro area, creating an urban food desert.

148
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,140
This is a void that dollar stores have stepped into.

149
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,780
Unlike Atlanta supermarkets, dollar stores trend south and west—largely the areas left

150
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
behind.

151
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,860
And they provide an important service—they provide foodstuffs and basic home supplies

152
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,940
at a low price point within walking distance or a manageable bus trip.

153
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,500
This has happened in Atlanta, it's happened in Dallas, it's happened in New Orleans,

154
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,300
and it's happened in a host of other major and minor American cities from Tulsa to Dayton.

155
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:48,140
In most of these urban cases, dollar stores effectively plug a hole that desperately needs

156
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,140
to be plugged.

157
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,060
It's for this reason that after some teenagers burned down a Dollar Tree in the city of Dayton

158
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,820
in 2017, the community pleaded for it to be reopened.

159
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,740
It's for this reason that the former New Orleans mayor celebrated the proliferation

160
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,240
of dollar stores as the return of business investment in the city's East End post-Katrina.

161
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,100
But plugging a hole is not solving a problem.

162
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,660
It's just an imperfect, temporary fix—not one meant to last.

163
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:18,620
That's because the impact of a dollar store in a food desert isn't neutral to the health

164
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,160
of a community—it's outright negative.

165
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,720
Most American food deserts aren't so different from, of all places, Haven, Kansas.

166
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,540
They have a dollar store, and they have, or until recently had, at least one grocery store

167
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,500
that carries shelf-stable foods along with fresh produce and refrigerated meats and dairy

168
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,820
products—the products that are lower margin for the business but lead to a more nutritious

169
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,480
and diverse diet.

170
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,020
Such stores have been harder and harder to come by, but many of America's tiniest towns

171
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,860
have, against all odds, resisted the massive Albertsons and Kroger-fueled grocery industry

172
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,980
consolidation.

173
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,080
Too small to be attractive for the supermarket chains, and are home to some of the country's

174
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,340
last independent grocers, right-sized to fit the communities they serve, barely hanging

175
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,220
on as the brutal economics of America's monopolistic food supply system push them

176
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,080
over the edge.

177
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,000
But their perilous economics become all but impossible with the arrival of a neighboring

178
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
dollar store.

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,140
In Haven, Kansas, this store was Foodliner, which, after the opening of the Dollar General,

180
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,060
saw its customer visits drop by nearly half, and after three years, saw its doors close

181
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,560
for good.

182
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,040
For any grocery store, it's typical for sales to drop by up to 30% when a dollar store

183
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,560
is open nearby, as consumers head for canned soup, frosted flakes, pop-tarts, and the countless

184
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,440
other shell staples that are just a bit cheaper and a bit more convenient.

185
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,940
This kills the grocery store that counts on such sales to justify carrying fresh produce,

186
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,280
pushing them out of business.

187
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,900
This, in turn, makes it more difficult to buy healthy, nutritious food, destroying the

188
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,580
food desert's oasis, and putting people of modest means and mobility at a nutritional

189
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,980
disadvantage.

190
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,140
And the impact of dollar stores on communities is broader than just what people eat.

191
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,620
In early 2019, the Dayton Daily News reported on plans for a new Dollar General on the east

192
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,620
side of town.

193
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,100
It'd be taking in the place of a now-closed grocery store, and it'd be the 70th dollar

194
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,240
store within a 10-mile radius of downtown Dayton, Ohio.

195
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,440
Like Atlanta, Dayton's dollar stores map closely along its most disadvantaged and downtrodden

196
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,520
areas.

197
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,020
Where their density is the highest is where poverty rates are the highest, and where their

198
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,000
footprint is nearly zero is the suburban communities of Kettering and Beaver Creek where household

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,060
incomes are higher and grocery stores far more prevalent.

200
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:48,860
At the end of 2019, local news reported that there were 28 separate dollar store robberies

201
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,980
in the Dayton area—down from the high-water mark of 32 in 2017, but up from 24 in 2018.

202
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,780
Effectively, dollar stores here have become a hotbed for crime.

203
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Now, in the case of Dayton, it's not that dollar stores are to be blamed for the area's

204
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:10,540
crime rate, but rather that the design of the stores make them easy targets.

205
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,180
Principally these businesses deal in cash, as not until 2004 did Dollar General even

206
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,700
take credit cards, making them ideal for a criminal of any level of experience.

207
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,340
Beyond cash, overflowing trash outside, cluttered aisles inside, full window advertisements,

208
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,280
light staffing, and outdated, poorly placed cameras, all hallmarks of dollar stores both

209
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,720
attract opportunistic burglary and make it difficult for police to safely navigate once

210
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,620
they arrive on scene.

211
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,060
In Dayton, the problem got to a point where the police received an average of nearly 1,000

212
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,860
calls to respond to dollar stores every year.

213
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,200
In response, the police began to proactively work with family dollar employees to establish

214
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,600
policies and management practices, from upkeep to more frequent cash transfers, that would

215
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,780
reduce vulnerability.

216
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:59,160
But the training just didn't take, as employees turned over so frequently and cared so little

217
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,760
about their near-minimum wage employer that they simply couldn't be bothered.

218
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,400
Such high resignation, in both senses of the word, point to another long-standing issue

219
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,000
only exacerbated by the arrival of dollar stores.

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,900
Along with further drying out food deserts and tempting crime, dollar stores provide

221
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,220
areas with only a few meager jobs.

222
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,020
The lean labor model may work for dollar stores' profitability, but it doesn't do much for

223
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,540
the surrounding community.

224
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,760
To keep labor costs low, a dollar store will only employ 6-10 people, and they'll only

225
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,060
be paid around minimum wage.

226
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,340
Dollar General, for instance, pays 92% of its employees under $15 an hour.

227
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,460
By themselves, these numbers are bad, but they get worse once considering the grocery

228
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,440
store that it might have replaced.

229
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,760
That independent grocer provides around 20 jobs—the dollar store, less than 10.

230
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,440
That independent grocer's profits stay circulating within the local economy, dollar store profits

231
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,760
are whisked away to faraway investors.

232
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,720
With food, crime, and jobs, dollar stores aren't the root of a problem that impacts

233
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,200
low-income communities, nor are they the answer.

234
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,480
They're a creative response to problems that take advantage of problems and then exacerbate

235
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,900
those problems.

236
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:15,320
But perhaps the most foolproof evidence to articulate that dollar stores are just plain

237
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,740
bad for rural and urban America alike is the fact that the communities themselves are pushing

238
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,600
back against their advance.

239
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,280
In response to the lack of pay and the danger inherent in working at Dollar General, employees

240
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,640
in 2023 protested around the company's headquarters in Goodlessville, Tennessee for better working

241
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
conditions.

242
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,620
In 2018, the city of Tulsa passed an ordinance to limit new dollar stores and instead encourage

243
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:41,680
full-service grocery stores.

244
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,360
In the move's wake, 75 communities have blocked dollar store proposals and 54 cities

245
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,120
have enacted limits on dollar store development.

246
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,480
Of course, these numbers are minor in comparison to the tens of thousands of dollar stores

247
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,760
now spread across the US, but each case of grassroots pushback serves as a powerful rebuttal.

248
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,680
That these communities, now marked by the neon sign signaling that the rest of the world

249
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,760
has largely forgotten about them, are a problem, and enough of a problem to bring communities

250
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,100
together, to fight back.

251
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,780
Fundamentally, Dollar General and its close equivalents are simply following the economic

252
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,120
path of least resistance—they're outcompeting local businesses, and they're doing it fairly—but

253
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,580
that path of least resistance leaves a trail of destruction that disadvantages individuals.

254
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:33,100
That's because individuals' best interests can work against their best interests.

255
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,600
People prefer having a dollar store and a grocery store and shopping at both, but in

256
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,740
the process of doing what they prefer in the short term, they destroy that grocery

257
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,700
store and create a scenario that is less desirable for themselves in the long term.

258
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,980
So, that's what government is for—it's an assembly of individuals into a collective

259
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:56,080
that can solve these strange mismatches between two sets of best interests.

260
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,180
The American Main Street is a fragile environment.

261
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,500
It's already taken a beating as big box retailers built up across the country, but

262
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,660
that battle was fought from a distance.

263
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,080
The one thing Walmart couldn't compete with was the locational convenience of small-town

264
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,160
stores for small towns.

265
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Dollar General can, and it is.

266
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,560
It's got a simple yet unbeatable business model, it's a black hole that sucks up variety

267
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:31,480
and vitality, and litters the American landscape with these perfectly destructive beige boxes.

268
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,960
Something I've noticed is that, despite being a very busy person, I always seem to

269
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,100
have small little gaps in my day where I end up just scrolling Twitter or TikTok or

270
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,060
Reddit, and while that's fine in moderation, I find myself using the excuse of I don't

271
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,540
have time for why I don't do certain things that I genuinely want to do.

272
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,180
That's why I'm such a big fan of our sponsor, Brilliant.

273
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,820
One of the things I want to do is learn new things, but that's often pretty tough to

274
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,380
do without a big block of open time.

275
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,020
But Brilliant designed these fantastic, interactive courses on STEM subjects that are broken down

276
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,340
into bite-sized chunks, so you can legitimately fit learning something like astrophysics

277
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,780
into basically any schedule.

278
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,660
And again, the courses are legitimately well-designed, so you're actually engaged and you actually

279
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,800
learn stuff since they break big concepts down into their intuitive base principles,

280
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,460
then bring them back together progressively as you go.

281
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,640
I find it so satisfying to learn something new, especially when it's something I never

282
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,680
could have imagined having a grasp on like calculus or complex numbers or quantum science.

283
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,080
Basically, if you're the kind of person that likes challenging yourself to learning

284
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,800
new things, Brilliant is for you, so you should go to brilliant.org slash wendover to try

285
