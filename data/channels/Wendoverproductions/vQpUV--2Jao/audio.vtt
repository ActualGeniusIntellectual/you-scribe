00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
To a certain, slightly uninformed expert, this Dollar General, in Faith, South Dakota,

00:05.640 --> 00:10.680
would seem an economic impossibility disproven only by its existence.

00:10.680 --> 00:16.080
Faith is a tiny place—a remote, no-stoplight prairie town of 367.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.820
It's got a couple of gas stations and a couple of inns and restaurants and an auto

00:20.820 --> 00:25.120
parts store, but what it doesn't have is a single nationwide brand.

00:25.120 --> 00:29.500
It doesn't have a single branch of any store, restaurant, or service that exists beyond

00:29.500 --> 00:33.560
the region around, except for Dollar General.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.460
But that doesn't explain the full extent of the anomaly, because Dollar General isn't

00:37.460 --> 00:42.760
just the only chain in Faith, it's the only chain in a 45-minute radius until one arrives

00:42.760 --> 00:48.380
at this Dairy Queen in the far larger, 3,000-person tribal capital of Eagle Butte.

00:48.380 --> 00:54.280
A 367-person population just isn't typically enough to attract a nationwide brand—there's

00:54.280 --> 00:59.420
just not enough money in the area to make capturing it attractive—and yet somehow,

00:59.420 --> 01:02.140
Dollar General makes it work.

01:02.140 --> 01:05.420
While perhaps an extreme example, there's no secret about Faith.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.300
It's not some tourist mecca, it's not an interstate oasis, it does sit at the intersection

01:10.300 --> 01:15.380
between a state and US highway, but it's not on the fastest route between any two cities,

01:15.380 --> 01:21.820
so this store, somehow, is sustained by the tiny community that surrounds it.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.140
This is anomalous in the context of national retailers, but not in the context of Dollar

01:26.140 --> 01:27.140
General.

01:27.140 --> 01:32.260
They're consistently persistent in places simply too small for other chains.

01:32.260 --> 01:37.060
Its next nearest location to the north is in a town of 1,200, to the east 1,100, and

01:37.060 --> 01:42.300
to the south and west 540 and 590, respectively.

01:42.300 --> 01:47.180
Walmart is also one of the most regular retailers in rural America, but they don't even come

01:47.180 --> 01:48.780
close to these numbers.

01:48.780 --> 01:52.620
There's no way to know for sure which are their lowest-traffic stores, and therefore

01:52.620 --> 01:56.820
what the minimum population that can support their economics is, but by letting the quantity

01:56.820 --> 02:02.900
of Google reviews act as an imperfect proxy, their location in Gunnison emerges as Colorado's

02:02.900 --> 02:04.620
least popular location.

02:04.620 --> 02:09.740
6,700 live within a 20 minute driving radius of this store, but revenue is likely buoyed

02:09.740 --> 02:13.860
by its positioning at the start of the dead-end highway up to the tourist town of Crested

02:13.860 --> 02:14.860
Butte.

02:14.860 --> 02:19.940
Similarly, Wyoming's least popular Walmart is its outpost in Rawlings, with a 6,300 person

02:19.940 --> 02:24.620
population within the same radius, but once again its revenue is likely boosted by its

02:24.620 --> 02:27.360
location along Interstate 80.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.500
So perhaps the best evidence of the minimum population to support the retailer's economics

02:31.500 --> 02:36.220
comes from Alaska, where its least popular store sits on the island of Kodiak.

02:36.220 --> 02:40.980
8,700 people live within a 20 minute radius, and there's clearly no interstate traffic

02:40.980 --> 02:43.020
coming through.

02:43.020 --> 02:47.380
Walmart revolutionized retail through its ability to turn a profit in small remote communities

02:47.380 --> 02:52.460
like Kodiak, its impact decimated the American Main Street, but Dollar General has taken

02:52.460 --> 02:54.900
that to a new extreme.

02:54.900 --> 03:01.040
Where Walmart entrenches itself in the thousands, Dollar General deals in the hundreds.

03:01.040 --> 03:05.300
This revolutionary retail concept starts on the inside.

03:05.300 --> 03:09.700
Total staff headcount at a given location typically sits between six and ten, and of

03:09.700 --> 03:12.900
those, just two or three might work at a given time.

03:12.900 --> 03:16.980
Given typical hourly rates and typical opening hours, that means Dollar General can spend

03:16.980 --> 03:22.700
as little as three to four hundred dollars a day staffing their lowest traffic stores.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.300
Then there's product offering complexity.

03:25.300 --> 03:29.020
A Walmart averages 140,000 unique products.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.700
They'll sell Coke in 10-count mini cans, 30-count mini cans, 12-count full-size cans,

03:33.700 --> 03:37.860
24-count full-size cans, 12-count mini bottles, 6-count full-size bottles, 12-count full-size

03:37.860 --> 03:41.340
bottles, 1-count 2-liter bottles, 4-count 4-liter bottles, and then they'll offer

03:41.340 --> 03:44.980
all these sizes for Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, and then they'll offer this

03:44.980 --> 03:50.260
same spread for every other soda brand and its variants, which is incredibly convenient.

03:50.260 --> 03:54.700
They have the exact soda, variant, bottle size, type, and quantity that any given person

03:54.700 --> 03:57.460
wants, but the permutations really add up.

03:57.460 --> 04:01.540
More individual products require a more complex supply chain, more floor space, and added

04:01.540 --> 04:06.100
staffing dedicated to organization, which adds to cost for the retailer.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.500
Dollar General, meanwhile, keeps it simple.

04:08.500 --> 04:13.240
They offer just 10,000 unique products, but they do this primarily not by reducing how

04:13.240 --> 04:18.680
many product categories they sell, but rather the optionality within each category.

04:18.680 --> 04:22.880
In a way, they're trying to be a mini Walmart, offering a one-stop shop experience, as long

04:22.880 --> 04:27.560
as you're willing to compromise on brand, size, quality, or quantity of a given product.

04:27.560 --> 04:33.320
So, whereas Walmart has a pan or toilet paper or detergent aisle, Dollar General has a pan,

04:33.320 --> 04:35.880
a toilet paper, or a detergent.

04:35.880 --> 04:40.920
Now, Walmart is likely able to purchase Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble for a fairly

04:40.920 --> 04:45.440
low price because it's the largest retailer in the world and therefore has very strong

04:45.440 --> 04:46.440
negotiating power.

04:46.440 --> 04:51.400
If it were to stop stocking Tide, P&G's revenues would take an enormous hit.

04:51.400 --> 04:55.660
But correspondingly, given the popularity of Tide, Walmart could take a hit if consumers

04:55.660 --> 04:59.120
decided to go to Target to buy the brand instead.

04:59.120 --> 05:04.080
Dollar General, meanwhile, has that same enormous negotiating power with their same enormous

05:04.080 --> 05:08.360
size, but crucially, they don't have to stock everything.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.760
Walmart's competitive advantage is that they're the definitive one-stop shop—they

05:12.760 --> 05:18.200
combine the local supermarket, hardware, electronics, home goods, and clothing stores into one.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.580
Dollar General's competitive advantage is that they're the shop—they are the only

05:22.580 --> 05:27.480
game in town and so they just need to offer one brand of laundry detergent and that's

05:27.480 --> 05:29.640
the detergent people will get.

05:29.640 --> 05:35.120
This bestows enormous negotiating leverage—manufacturers will bend to their whims in order to become

05:35.120 --> 05:39.400
the Dollar General detergent supplier, meaning they might be able to get a similar or even

05:39.400 --> 05:43.080
better deal from P&G on detergent pricing than even Walmart.

05:43.080 --> 05:49.520
That's what leads to products like this—Dollar General's $1 Tide brand detergent.

05:49.520 --> 05:53.920
To balance the retailer's need for a low-cost offering with their desire to maintain a premium

05:53.920 --> 05:58.880
name-brand image, Procter & Gamble has gone out of their way to manufacture a $1 Tide

05:58.880 --> 06:00.000
detergent bottle.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.400
Now, Walmart actually sells this same product for less.

06:03.400 --> 06:08.560
Their 128 fluid ounce size works out to under 12 cents per load—almost half of Dollar

06:08.560 --> 06:14.480
General's 20 cents per—but Dollar General's target consumer is one who is severely cash-strapped.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.560
They cater to the class of consumers that might want to spend $10 on bulk detergent

06:18.560 --> 06:22.680
that will last for months, but chooses the $1 option regardless to keep enough cash on

06:22.680 --> 06:25.120
hand to pay rent before their next payday.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.920
So, Dollar General actually charges more per load, and even better, their consumer will

06:29.920 --> 06:34.080
want to come back sooner than Walmart's to buy a refill, at which time they'll also

06:34.080 --> 06:37.840
buy whatever else they need, therefore extracting more revenue.

06:37.840 --> 06:43.340
But Dollar General's true strategic linchpin is the most anomalous aspect of its business

06:43.340 --> 06:46.360
model—its remote locations.

06:46.360 --> 06:52.280
The retailer has turned what would be a weakness for others into the core of its strength.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.840
It starts with cost.

06:53.840 --> 06:59.080
Rent at this store in North Creek, New York is $118,000 a year, at this store in Sullivan,

06:59.080 --> 07:05.480
Maine, $103,000 a year, and at that faith South Dakota location, $106,000 a year.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.680
That works out to between three and four hundred dollars in rent per day, which, added to their

07:09.680 --> 07:13.800
three or four hundred dollars in daily staffing costs, underpins Dollar General's ability

07:13.800 --> 07:17.380
to run a store with under a thousand dollars of overhead per day.

07:17.380 --> 07:21.400
In general, they just won't set up a location in a place where they'll have to pay over

07:21.400 --> 07:27.480
$150,000 or so in annual rent—it just breaks their low-cost business model.

07:27.480 --> 07:33.280
But low rent costs are far from the key that unlocks rural America—rather, remoteness

07:33.280 --> 07:36.880
itself enables their remoteness.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.680
Take their location in Haven, Kansas.

07:39.680 --> 07:45.120
This is a town of 1,170 that simply does not have a grocery store.

07:45.120 --> 07:49.240
They have a gas station and a liquor store and a coffee shop and diner, but they don't

07:49.240 --> 07:50.760
have a grocery store.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.160
Dollar General is not a grocery store, but their locations do stock shelf-stable dry

07:55.160 --> 07:59.600
goods and frozen food, and some sell a limited supply of perishables.

07:59.600 --> 08:03.920
The closest dedicated grocery store is a full ten-minute drive away in the next town, and

08:03.920 --> 08:08.180
it's small—not one that could necessarily fulfill all of a person's needs.

08:08.180 --> 08:12.440
The closest supermarket is a full twenty-two minutes away in the city of Hutchinson, so

08:12.440 --> 08:16.560
what happens in practice, when Dollar General enters a market like Haven, is that rather

08:16.560 --> 08:20.320
than making that ten or twenty-two minute trip, people shop out of the local Dollar

08:20.320 --> 08:24.500
General for regular day-to-day needs, then make less frequent trips to the distant grocery

08:24.500 --> 08:27.480
store for fresh and specialty items.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.900
But increasingly, this pattern isn't confined to Dollar General, and it isn't confined

08:31.900 --> 08:34.220
to rural America either.

08:34.220 --> 08:38.180
This is Atlanta, Georgia, and the surrounding cities, suburbs, and communities that comprise

08:38.180 --> 08:41.740
much of the broader Atlanta metro area.

08:41.740 --> 08:46.500
This is a map of their most common grocery stores—Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Lidl,

08:46.500 --> 08:48.560
Publix, Kroger, and Walmart.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.540
They all do the same thing—they all trend north and east.

08:52.540 --> 08:58.540
But people live here, too, and they too need food to eat and stores to buy food to eat.

08:58.540 --> 09:03.540
For anyone, this would make grocery shopping more of a pain than it already is.

09:03.540 --> 09:07.300
Making things more difficult, though, this gap of grocery stores is also home to the

09:07.300 --> 09:12.220
metro area's least mobile, as these census tracts contain, in the words of the USDA's

09:12.220 --> 09:16.700
Food Access Atlas, more than a hundred households with no access to a vehicle and are more than

09:16.700 --> 09:19.260
a half mile from the nearest supermarket.

09:19.300 --> 09:24.300
Unsurprisingly, this correlates closely with tracts that are low income, as all these areas

09:24.300 --> 09:29.700
have a poverty rate of over 20%, or a medium family income of less than 80% of the medium

09:29.700 --> 09:32.460
income for the state or metro area.

09:32.460 --> 09:37.980
Put together, Atlanta residents with the least money and least mobility are the farthest

09:37.980 --> 09:39.980
from supermarkets.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.860
Now of course it's not a simple coincidence that some of the poorest and least mobile

09:43.860 --> 09:47.420
populations of Atlanta are farthest from supermarkets.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.540
Businesses after all are areas still grappling with the legacy of redlining in the past,

09:51.540 --> 09:56.900
and areas that some academics have identified as current instances of supermarket redlining—the

09:56.900 --> 10:01.080
process by which businesses intentionally keep their distance from such areas for reasons

10:01.080 --> 10:05.900
that vary from crime rate and purchasing power to zoning restrictions and unfavorable street

10:05.900 --> 10:06.900
layouts.

10:06.900 --> 10:11.380
But regardless of their reasons, supermarkets simply don't exist in a large portion of

10:11.380 --> 10:15.740
the Atlanta metro area, creating an urban food desert.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.140
This is a void that dollar stores have stepped into.

10:19.140 --> 10:24.780
Unlike Atlanta supermarkets, dollar stores trend south and west—largely the areas left

10:24.780 --> 10:25.780
behind.

10:25.780 --> 10:29.860
And they provide an important service—they provide foodstuffs and basic home supplies

10:29.860 --> 10:33.940
at a low price point within walking distance or a manageable bus trip.

10:33.940 --> 10:37.500
This has happened in Atlanta, it's happened in Dallas, it's happened in New Orleans,

10:37.500 --> 10:43.300
and it's happened in a host of other major and minor American cities from Tulsa to Dayton.

10:43.340 --> 10:48.140
In most of these urban cases, dollar stores effectively plug a hole that desperately needs

10:48.140 --> 10:49.140
to be plugged.

10:49.140 --> 10:53.060
It's for this reason that after some teenagers burned down a Dollar Tree in the city of Dayton

10:53.060 --> 10:56.820
in 2017, the community pleaded for it to be reopened.

10:56.820 --> 11:00.740
It's for this reason that the former New Orleans mayor celebrated the proliferation

11:00.740 --> 11:06.240
of dollar stores as the return of business investment in the city's East End post-Katrina.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.100
But plugging a hole is not solving a problem.

11:09.100 --> 11:13.660
It's just an imperfect, temporary fix—not one meant to last.

11:13.660 --> 11:18.620
That's because the impact of a dollar store in a food desert isn't neutral to the health

11:18.620 --> 11:23.160
of a community—it's outright negative.

11:23.160 --> 11:28.720
Most American food deserts aren't so different from, of all places, Haven, Kansas.

11:28.720 --> 11:34.540
They have a dollar store, and they have, or until recently had, at least one grocery store

11:34.540 --> 11:39.500
that carries shelf-stable foods along with fresh produce and refrigerated meats and dairy

11:39.500 --> 11:43.820
products—the products that are lower margin for the business but lead to a more nutritious

11:43.820 --> 11:45.480
and diverse diet.

11:45.480 --> 11:50.020
Such stores have been harder and harder to come by, but many of America's tiniest towns

11:50.020 --> 11:55.860
have, against all odds, resisted the massive Albertsons and Kroger-fueled grocery industry

11:55.860 --> 11:56.980
consolidation.

11:56.980 --> 12:01.080
Too small to be attractive for the supermarket chains, and are home to some of the country's

12:01.080 --> 12:05.340
last independent grocers, right-sized to fit the communities they serve, barely hanging

12:05.340 --> 12:10.220
on as the brutal economics of America's monopolistic food supply system push them

12:10.220 --> 12:12.080
over the edge.

12:12.080 --> 12:17.000
But their perilous economics become all but impossible with the arrival of a neighboring

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
dollar store.

12:18.000 --> 12:23.140
In Haven, Kansas, this store was Foodliner, which, after the opening of the Dollar General,

12:23.140 --> 12:29.060
saw its customer visits drop by nearly half, and after three years, saw its doors close

12:29.060 --> 12:30.560
for good.

12:30.560 --> 12:35.040
For any grocery store, it's typical for sales to drop by up to 30% when a dollar store

12:35.040 --> 12:40.560
is open nearby, as consumers head for canned soup, frosted flakes, pop-tarts, and the countless

12:40.560 --> 12:45.440
other shell staples that are just a bit cheaper and a bit more convenient.

12:45.440 --> 12:50.940
This kills the grocery store that counts on such sales to justify carrying fresh produce,

12:50.940 --> 12:53.280
pushing them out of business.

12:53.280 --> 12:58.900
This, in turn, makes it more difficult to buy healthy, nutritious food, destroying the

12:58.900 --> 13:03.580
food desert's oasis, and putting people of modest means and mobility at a nutritional

13:03.580 --> 13:05.980
disadvantage.

13:05.980 --> 13:11.140
And the impact of dollar stores on communities is broader than just what people eat.

13:11.140 --> 13:15.620
In early 2019, the Dayton Daily News reported on plans for a new Dollar General on the east

13:15.620 --> 13:16.620
side of town.

13:16.620 --> 13:21.100
It'd be taking in the place of a now-closed grocery store, and it'd be the 70th dollar

13:21.100 --> 13:25.240
store within a 10-mile radius of downtown Dayton, Ohio.

13:25.240 --> 13:30.440
Like Atlanta, Dayton's dollar stores map closely along its most disadvantaged and downtrodden

13:30.440 --> 13:31.520
areas.

13:31.520 --> 13:35.020
Where their density is the highest is where poverty rates are the highest, and where their

13:35.020 --> 13:40.000
footprint is nearly zero is the suburban communities of Kettering and Beaver Creek where household

13:40.000 --> 13:44.060
incomes are higher and grocery stores far more prevalent.

13:44.060 --> 13:48.860
At the end of 2019, local news reported that there were 28 separate dollar store robberies

13:48.860 --> 13:55.980
in the Dayton area—down from the high-water mark of 32 in 2017, but up from 24 in 2018.

13:55.980 --> 14:00.780
Effectively, dollar stores here have become a hotbed for crime.

14:00.780 --> 14:05.780
Now, in the case of Dayton, it's not that dollar stores are to be blamed for the area's

14:05.780 --> 14:10.540
crime rate, but rather that the design of the stores make them easy targets.

14:10.540 --> 14:15.180
Principally these businesses deal in cash, as not until 2004 did Dollar General even

14:15.180 --> 14:19.700
take credit cards, making them ideal for a criminal of any level of experience.

14:19.700 --> 14:25.340
Beyond cash, overflowing trash outside, cluttered aisles inside, full window advertisements,

14:25.340 --> 14:30.280
light staffing, and outdated, poorly placed cameras, all hallmarks of dollar stores both

14:30.280 --> 14:34.720
attract opportunistic burglary and make it difficult for police to safely navigate once

14:34.720 --> 14:36.620
they arrive on scene.

14:36.620 --> 14:41.060
In Dayton, the problem got to a point where the police received an average of nearly 1,000

14:41.060 --> 14:43.860
calls to respond to dollar stores every year.

14:43.860 --> 14:48.200
In response, the police began to proactively work with family dollar employees to establish

14:48.200 --> 14:52.600
policies and management practices, from upkeep to more frequent cash transfers, that would

14:52.600 --> 14:53.780
reduce vulnerability.

14:53.780 --> 14:59.160
But the training just didn't take, as employees turned over so frequently and cared so little

14:59.160 --> 15:03.760
about their near-minimum wage employer that they simply couldn't be bothered.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.400
Such high resignation, in both senses of the word, point to another long-standing issue

15:08.400 --> 15:12.000
only exacerbated by the arrival of dollar stores.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.900
Along with further drying out food deserts and tempting crime, dollar stores provide

15:15.900 --> 15:19.220
areas with only a few meager jobs.

15:19.220 --> 15:24.020
The lean labor model may work for dollar stores' profitability, but it doesn't do much for

15:24.020 --> 15:25.540
the surrounding community.

15:25.540 --> 15:29.760
To keep labor costs low, a dollar store will only employ 6-10 people, and they'll only

15:29.760 --> 15:32.060
be paid around minimum wage.

15:32.060 --> 15:37.340
Dollar General, for instance, pays 92% of its employees under $15 an hour.

15:37.340 --> 15:41.460
By themselves, these numbers are bad, but they get worse once considering the grocery

15:41.460 --> 15:43.440
store that it might have replaced.

15:43.440 --> 15:48.760
That independent grocer provides around 20 jobs—the dollar store, less than 10.

15:48.760 --> 15:53.440
That independent grocer's profits stay circulating within the local economy, dollar store profits

15:53.440 --> 15:56.760
are whisked away to faraway investors.

15:56.760 --> 16:01.720
With food, crime, and jobs, dollar stores aren't the root of a problem that impacts

16:01.720 --> 16:05.200
low-income communities, nor are they the answer.

16:05.200 --> 16:09.480
They're a creative response to problems that take advantage of problems and then exacerbate

16:09.480 --> 16:10.900
those problems.

16:10.900 --> 16:15.320
But perhaps the most foolproof evidence to articulate that dollar stores are just plain

16:15.320 --> 16:20.740
bad for rural and urban America alike is the fact that the communities themselves are pushing

16:20.740 --> 16:23.600
back against their advance.

16:23.600 --> 16:28.280
In response to the lack of pay and the danger inherent in working at Dollar General, employees

16:28.280 --> 16:33.640
in 2023 protested around the company's headquarters in Goodlessville, Tennessee for better working

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
conditions.

16:34.640 --> 16:39.620
In 2018, the city of Tulsa passed an ordinance to limit new dollar stores and instead encourage

16:39.620 --> 16:41.680
full-service grocery stores.

16:41.680 --> 16:46.360
In the move's wake, 75 communities have blocked dollar store proposals and 54 cities

16:46.360 --> 16:49.120
have enacted limits on dollar store development.

16:49.120 --> 16:53.480
Of course, these numbers are minor in comparison to the tens of thousands of dollar stores

16:53.480 --> 16:59.760
now spread across the US, but each case of grassroots pushback serves as a powerful rebuttal.

16:59.760 --> 17:03.680
That these communities, now marked by the neon sign signaling that the rest of the world

17:03.680 --> 17:08.760
has largely forgotten about them, are a problem, and enough of a problem to bring communities

17:08.760 --> 17:11.100
together, to fight back.

17:11.100 --> 17:15.780
Fundamentally, Dollar General and its close equivalents are simply following the economic

17:15.780 --> 17:21.120
path of least resistance—they're outcompeting local businesses, and they're doing it fairly—but

17:21.120 --> 17:26.580
that path of least resistance leaves a trail of destruction that disadvantages individuals.

17:26.580 --> 17:33.100
That's because individuals' best interests can work against their best interests.

17:33.100 --> 17:37.600
People prefer having a dollar store and a grocery store and shopping at both, but in

17:37.600 --> 17:41.740
the process of doing what they prefer in the short term, they destroy that grocery

17:41.740 --> 17:46.700
store and create a scenario that is less desirable for themselves in the long term.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.980
So, that's what government is for—it's an assembly of individuals into a collective

17:50.980 --> 17:56.080
that can solve these strange mismatches between two sets of best interests.

17:56.080 --> 17:59.180
The American Main Street is a fragile environment.

17:59.180 --> 18:04.500
It's already taken a beating as big box retailers built up across the country, but

18:04.500 --> 18:06.660
that battle was fought from a distance.

18:06.660 --> 18:11.080
The one thing Walmart couldn't compete with was the locational convenience of small-town

18:11.080 --> 18:14.160
stores for small towns.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.480
Dollar General can, and it is.

18:16.480 --> 18:22.560
It's got a simple yet unbeatable business model, it's a black hole that sucks up variety

18:22.560 --> 18:31.480
and vitality, and litters the American landscape with these perfectly destructive beige boxes.

18:31.480 --> 18:34.960
Something I've noticed is that, despite being a very busy person, I always seem to

18:34.960 --> 18:39.100
have small little gaps in my day where I end up just scrolling Twitter or TikTok or

18:39.100 --> 18:43.060
Reddit, and while that's fine in moderation, I find myself using the excuse of I don't

18:43.060 --> 18:46.540
have time for why I don't do certain things that I genuinely want to do.

18:46.540 --> 18:50.180
That's why I'm such a big fan of our sponsor, Brilliant.

18:50.180 --> 18:53.820
One of the things I want to do is learn new things, but that's often pretty tough to

18:53.820 --> 18:56.380
do without a big block of open time.

18:56.380 --> 19:01.020
But Brilliant designed these fantastic, interactive courses on STEM subjects that are broken down

19:01.020 --> 19:05.340
into bite-sized chunks, so you can legitimately fit learning something like astrophysics

19:05.340 --> 19:07.780
into basically any schedule.

19:07.780 --> 19:12.660
And again, the courses are legitimately well-designed, so you're actually engaged and you actually

19:12.660 --> 19:16.800
learn stuff since they break big concepts down into their intuitive base principles,

19:16.800 --> 19:19.460
then bring them back together progressively as you go.

19:19.460 --> 19:23.640
I find it so satisfying to learn something new, especially when it's something I never

19:23.640 --> 19:28.680
could have imagined having a grasp on like calculus or complex numbers or quantum science.

19:28.680 --> 19:32.080
Basically, if you're the kind of person that likes challenging yourself to learning

19:32.080 --> 19:36.800
new things, Brilliant is for you, so you should go to brilliant.org slash wendover to try

19:36.800 --> 19:40.520
everything Brilliant has to offer free for a full 30 days.

19:40.520 --> 19:45.980
Plus, the first 200 to use that link will also get 20% off Brilliant's annual premium
