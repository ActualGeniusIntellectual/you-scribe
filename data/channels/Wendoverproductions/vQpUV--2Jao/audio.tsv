0	5640	To a certain, slightly uninformed expert, this Dollar General, in Faith, South Dakota,
5640	10680	would seem an economic impossibility disproven only by its existence.
10680	16080	Faith is a tiny place—a remote, no-stoplight prairie town of 367.
16080	20820	It's got a couple of gas stations and a couple of inns and restaurants and an auto
20820	25120	parts store, but what it doesn't have is a single nationwide brand.
25120	29500	It doesn't have a single branch of any store, restaurant, or service that exists beyond
29500	33560	the region around, except for Dollar General.
33560	37460	But that doesn't explain the full extent of the anomaly, because Dollar General isn't
37460	42760	just the only chain in Faith, it's the only chain in a 45-minute radius until one arrives
42760	48380	at this Dairy Queen in the far larger, 3,000-person tribal capital of Eagle Butte.
48380	54280	A 367-person population just isn't typically enough to attract a nationwide brand—there's
54280	59420	just not enough money in the area to make capturing it attractive—and yet somehow,
59420	62140	Dollar General makes it work.
62140	65420	While perhaps an extreme example, there's no secret about Faith.
65420	70300	It's not some tourist mecca, it's not an interstate oasis, it does sit at the intersection
70300	75380	between a state and US highway, but it's not on the fastest route between any two cities,
75380	81820	so this store, somehow, is sustained by the tiny community that surrounds it.
81820	86140	This is anomalous in the context of national retailers, but not in the context of Dollar
86140	87140	General.
87140	92260	They're consistently persistent in places simply too small for other chains.
92260	97060	Its next nearest location to the north is in a town of 1,200, to the east 1,100, and
97060	102300	to the south and west 540 and 590, respectively.
102300	107180	Walmart is also one of the most regular retailers in rural America, but they don't even come
107180	108780	close to these numbers.
108780	112620	There's no way to know for sure which are their lowest-traffic stores, and therefore
112620	116820	what the minimum population that can support their economics is, but by letting the quantity
116820	122900	of Google reviews act as an imperfect proxy, their location in Gunnison emerges as Colorado's
122900	124620	least popular location.
124620	129740	6,700 live within a 20 minute driving radius of this store, but revenue is likely buoyed
129740	133860	by its positioning at the start of the dead-end highway up to the tourist town of Crested
133860	134860	Butte.
134860	139940	Similarly, Wyoming's least popular Walmart is its outpost in Rawlings, with a 6,300 person
139940	144620	population within the same radius, but once again its revenue is likely boosted by its
144620	147360	location along Interstate 80.
147360	151500	So perhaps the best evidence of the minimum population to support the retailer's economics
151500	156220	comes from Alaska, where its least popular store sits on the island of Kodiak.
156220	160980	8,700 people live within a 20 minute radius, and there's clearly no interstate traffic
160980	163020	coming through.
163020	167380	Walmart revolutionized retail through its ability to turn a profit in small remote communities
167380	172460	like Kodiak, its impact decimated the American Main Street, but Dollar General has taken
172460	174900	that to a new extreme.
174900	181040	Where Walmart entrenches itself in the thousands, Dollar General deals in the hundreds.
181040	185300	This revolutionary retail concept starts on the inside.
185300	189700	Total staff headcount at a given location typically sits between six and ten, and of
189700	192900	those, just two or three might work at a given time.
192900	196980	Given typical hourly rates and typical opening hours, that means Dollar General can spend
196980	202700	as little as three to four hundred dollars a day staffing their lowest traffic stores.
202700	205300	Then there's product offering complexity.
205300	209020	A Walmart averages 140,000 unique products.
209020	213700	They'll sell Coke in 10-count mini cans, 30-count mini cans, 12-count full-size cans,
213700	217860	24-count full-size cans, 12-count mini bottles, 6-count full-size bottles, 12-count full-size
217860	221340	bottles, 1-count 2-liter bottles, 4-count 4-liter bottles, and then they'll offer
221340	224980	all these sizes for Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Cherry Coke, and then they'll offer this
224980	230260	same spread for every other soda brand and its variants, which is incredibly convenient.
230260	234700	They have the exact soda, variant, bottle size, type, and quantity that any given person
234700	237460	wants, but the permutations really add up.
237460	241540	More individual products require a more complex supply chain, more floor space, and added
241540	246100	staffing dedicated to organization, which adds to cost for the retailer.
246100	248500	Dollar General, meanwhile, keeps it simple.
248500	253240	They offer just 10,000 unique products, but they do this primarily not by reducing how
253240	258680	many product categories they sell, but rather the optionality within each category.
258680	262880	In a way, they're trying to be a mini Walmart, offering a one-stop shop experience, as long
262880	267560	as you're willing to compromise on brand, size, quality, or quantity of a given product.
267560	273320	So, whereas Walmart has a pan or toilet paper or detergent aisle, Dollar General has a pan,
273320	275880	a toilet paper, or a detergent.
275880	280920	Now, Walmart is likely able to purchase Tide detergent from Procter & Gamble for a fairly
280920	285440	low price because it's the largest retailer in the world and therefore has very strong
285440	286440	negotiating power.
286440	291400	If it were to stop stocking Tide, P&G's revenues would take an enormous hit.
291400	295660	But correspondingly, given the popularity of Tide, Walmart could take a hit if consumers
295660	299120	decided to go to Target to buy the brand instead.
299120	304080	Dollar General, meanwhile, has that same enormous negotiating power with their same enormous
304080	308360	size, but crucially, they don't have to stock everything.
308800	312760	Walmart's competitive advantage is that they're the definitive one-stop shop—they
312760	318200	combine the local supermarket, hardware, electronics, home goods, and clothing stores into one.
318200	322580	Dollar General's competitive advantage is that they're the shop—they are the only
322580	327480	game in town and so they just need to offer one brand of laundry detergent and that's
327480	329640	the detergent people will get.
329640	335120	This bestows enormous negotiating leverage—manufacturers will bend to their whims in order to become
335120	339400	the Dollar General detergent supplier, meaning they might be able to get a similar or even
339400	343080	better deal from P&G on detergent pricing than even Walmart.
343080	349520	That's what leads to products like this—Dollar General's $1 Tide brand detergent.
349520	353920	To balance the retailer's need for a low-cost offering with their desire to maintain a premium
353920	358880	name-brand image, Procter & Gamble has gone out of their way to manufacture a $1 Tide
358880	360000	detergent bottle.
360000	363400	Now, Walmart actually sells this same product for less.
363400	368560	Their 128 fluid ounce size works out to under 12 cents per load—almost half of Dollar
368560	374480	General's 20 cents per—but Dollar General's target consumer is one who is severely cash-strapped.
374480	378560	They cater to the class of consumers that might want to spend $10 on bulk detergent
378560	382680	that will last for months, but chooses the $1 option regardless to keep enough cash on
382680	385120	hand to pay rent before their next payday.
385120	389920	So, Dollar General actually charges more per load, and even better, their consumer will
389920	394080	want to come back sooner than Walmart's to buy a refill, at which time they'll also
394080	397840	buy whatever else they need, therefore extracting more revenue.
397840	403340	But Dollar General's true strategic linchpin is the most anomalous aspect of its business
403340	406360	model—its remote locations.
406360	412280	The retailer has turned what would be a weakness for others into the core of its strength.
412280	413840	It starts with cost.
413840	419080	Rent at this store in North Creek, New York is $118,000 a year, at this store in Sullivan,
419080	425480	Maine, $103,000 a year, and at that faith South Dakota location, $106,000 a year.
425480	429680	That works out to between three and four hundred dollars in rent per day, which, added to their
429680	433800	three or four hundred dollars in daily staffing costs, underpins Dollar General's ability
433800	437380	to run a store with under a thousand dollars of overhead per day.
437380	441400	In general, they just won't set up a location in a place where they'll have to pay over
441400	447480	$150,000 or so in annual rent—it just breaks their low-cost business model.
447480	453280	But low rent costs are far from the key that unlocks rural America—rather, remoteness
453280	456880	itself enables their remoteness.
456880	459680	Take their location in Haven, Kansas.
459680	465120	This is a town of 1,170 that simply does not have a grocery store.
465120	469240	They have a gas station and a liquor store and a coffee shop and diner, but they don't
469240	470760	have a grocery store.
470760	475160	Dollar General is not a grocery store, but their locations do stock shelf-stable dry
475160	479600	goods and frozen food, and some sell a limited supply of perishables.
479600	483920	The closest dedicated grocery store is a full ten-minute drive away in the next town, and
483920	488180	it's small—not one that could necessarily fulfill all of a person's needs.
488180	492440	The closest supermarket is a full twenty-two minutes away in the city of Hutchinson, so
492440	496560	what happens in practice, when Dollar General enters a market like Haven, is that rather
496560	500320	than making that ten or twenty-two minute trip, people shop out of the local Dollar
500320	504500	General for regular day-to-day needs, then make less frequent trips to the distant grocery
504500	507480	store for fresh and specialty items.
507480	511900	But increasingly, this pattern isn't confined to Dollar General, and it isn't confined
511900	514220	to rural America either.
514220	518180	This is Atlanta, Georgia, and the surrounding cities, suburbs, and communities that comprise
518180	521740	much of the broader Atlanta metro area.
521740	526500	This is a map of their most common grocery stores—Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Lidl,
526500	528560	Publix, Kroger, and Walmart.
528560	532540	They all do the same thing—they all trend north and east.
532540	538540	But people live here, too, and they too need food to eat and stores to buy food to eat.
538540	543540	For anyone, this would make grocery shopping more of a pain than it already is.
543540	547300	Making things more difficult, though, this gap of grocery stores is also home to the
547300	552220	metro area's least mobile, as these census tracts contain, in the words of the USDA's
552220	556700	Food Access Atlas, more than a hundred households with no access to a vehicle and are more than
556700	559260	a half mile from the nearest supermarket.
559300	564300	Unsurprisingly, this correlates closely with tracts that are low income, as all these areas
564300	569700	have a poverty rate of over 20%, or a medium family income of less than 80% of the medium
569700	572460	income for the state or metro area.
572460	577980	Put together, Atlanta residents with the least money and least mobility are the farthest
577980	579980	from supermarkets.
579980	583860	Now of course it's not a simple coincidence that some of the poorest and least mobile
583860	587420	populations of Atlanta are farthest from supermarkets.
587420	591540	Businesses after all are areas still grappling with the legacy of redlining in the past,
591540	596900	and areas that some academics have identified as current instances of supermarket redlining—the
596900	601080	process by which businesses intentionally keep their distance from such areas for reasons
601080	605900	that vary from crime rate and purchasing power to zoning restrictions and unfavorable street
605900	606900	layouts.
606900	611380	But regardless of their reasons, supermarkets simply don't exist in a large portion of
611380	615740	the Atlanta metro area, creating an urban food desert.
615740	619140	This is a void that dollar stores have stepped into.
619140	624780	Unlike Atlanta supermarkets, dollar stores trend south and west—largely the areas left
624780	625780	behind.
625780	629860	And they provide an important service—they provide foodstuffs and basic home supplies
629860	633940	at a low price point within walking distance or a manageable bus trip.
633940	637500	This has happened in Atlanta, it's happened in Dallas, it's happened in New Orleans,
637500	643300	and it's happened in a host of other major and minor American cities from Tulsa to Dayton.
643340	648140	In most of these urban cases, dollar stores effectively plug a hole that desperately needs
648140	649140	to be plugged.
649140	653060	It's for this reason that after some teenagers burned down a Dollar Tree in the city of Dayton
653060	656820	in 2017, the community pleaded for it to be reopened.
656820	660740	It's for this reason that the former New Orleans mayor celebrated the proliferation
660740	666240	of dollar stores as the return of business investment in the city's East End post-Katrina.
666240	669100	But plugging a hole is not solving a problem.
669100	673660	It's just an imperfect, temporary fix—not one meant to last.
673660	678620	That's because the impact of a dollar store in a food desert isn't neutral to the health
678620	683160	of a community—it's outright negative.
683160	688720	Most American food deserts aren't so different from, of all places, Haven, Kansas.
688720	694540	They have a dollar store, and they have, or until recently had, at least one grocery store
694540	699500	that carries shelf-stable foods along with fresh produce and refrigerated meats and dairy
699500	703820	products—the products that are lower margin for the business but lead to a more nutritious
703820	705480	and diverse diet.
705480	710020	Such stores have been harder and harder to come by, but many of America's tiniest towns
710020	715860	have, against all odds, resisted the massive Albertsons and Kroger-fueled grocery industry
715860	716980	consolidation.
716980	721080	Too small to be attractive for the supermarket chains, and are home to some of the country's
721080	725340	last independent grocers, right-sized to fit the communities they serve, barely hanging
725340	730220	on as the brutal economics of America's monopolistic food supply system push them
730220	732080	over the edge.
732080	737000	But their perilous economics become all but impossible with the arrival of a neighboring
737000	738000	dollar store.
738000	743140	In Haven, Kansas, this store was Foodliner, which, after the opening of the Dollar General,
743140	749060	saw its customer visits drop by nearly half, and after three years, saw its doors close
749060	750560	for good.
750560	755040	For any grocery store, it's typical for sales to drop by up to 30% when a dollar store
755040	760560	is open nearby, as consumers head for canned soup, frosted flakes, pop-tarts, and the countless
760560	765440	other shell staples that are just a bit cheaper and a bit more convenient.
765440	770940	This kills the grocery store that counts on such sales to justify carrying fresh produce,
770940	773280	pushing them out of business.
773280	778900	This, in turn, makes it more difficult to buy healthy, nutritious food, destroying the
778900	783580	food desert's oasis, and putting people of modest means and mobility at a nutritional
783580	785980	disadvantage.
785980	791140	And the impact of dollar stores on communities is broader than just what people eat.
791140	795620	In early 2019, the Dayton Daily News reported on plans for a new Dollar General on the east
795620	796620	side of town.
796620	801100	It'd be taking in the place of a now-closed grocery store, and it'd be the 70th dollar
801100	805240	store within a 10-mile radius of downtown Dayton, Ohio.
805240	810440	Like Atlanta, Dayton's dollar stores map closely along its most disadvantaged and downtrodden
810440	811520	areas.
811520	815020	Where their density is the highest is where poverty rates are the highest, and where their
815020	820000	footprint is nearly zero is the suburban communities of Kettering and Beaver Creek where household
820000	824060	incomes are higher and grocery stores far more prevalent.
824060	828860	At the end of 2019, local news reported that there were 28 separate dollar store robberies
828860	835980	in the Dayton area—down from the high-water mark of 32 in 2017, but up from 24 in 2018.
835980	840780	Effectively, dollar stores here have become a hotbed for crime.
840780	845780	Now, in the case of Dayton, it's not that dollar stores are to be blamed for the area's
845780	850540	crime rate, but rather that the design of the stores make them easy targets.
850540	855180	Principally these businesses deal in cash, as not until 2004 did Dollar General even
855180	859700	take credit cards, making them ideal for a criminal of any level of experience.
859700	865340	Beyond cash, overflowing trash outside, cluttered aisles inside, full window advertisements,
865340	870280	light staffing, and outdated, poorly placed cameras, all hallmarks of dollar stores both
870280	874720	attract opportunistic burglary and make it difficult for police to safely navigate once
874720	876620	they arrive on scene.
876620	881060	In Dayton, the problem got to a point where the police received an average of nearly 1,000
881060	883860	calls to respond to dollar stores every year.
883860	888200	In response, the police began to proactively work with family dollar employees to establish
888200	892600	policies and management practices, from upkeep to more frequent cash transfers, that would
892600	893780	reduce vulnerability.
893780	899160	But the training just didn't take, as employees turned over so frequently and cared so little
899160	903760	about their near-minimum wage employer that they simply couldn't be bothered.
903760	908400	Such high resignation, in both senses of the word, point to another long-standing issue
908400	912000	only exacerbated by the arrival of dollar stores.
912000	915900	Along with further drying out food deserts and tempting crime, dollar stores provide
915900	919220	areas with only a few meager jobs.
919220	924020	The lean labor model may work for dollar stores' profitability, but it doesn't do much for
924020	925540	the surrounding community.
925540	929760	To keep labor costs low, a dollar store will only employ 6-10 people, and they'll only
929760	932060	be paid around minimum wage.
932060	937340	Dollar General, for instance, pays 92% of its employees under $15 an hour.
937340	941460	By themselves, these numbers are bad, but they get worse once considering the grocery
941460	943440	store that it might have replaced.
943440	948760	That independent grocer provides around 20 jobs—the dollar store, less than 10.
948760	953440	That independent grocer's profits stay circulating within the local economy, dollar store profits
953440	956760	are whisked away to faraway investors.
956760	961720	With food, crime, and jobs, dollar stores aren't the root of a problem that impacts
961720	965200	low-income communities, nor are they the answer.
965200	969480	They're a creative response to problems that take advantage of problems and then exacerbate
969480	970900	those problems.
970900	975320	But perhaps the most foolproof evidence to articulate that dollar stores are just plain
975320	980740	bad for rural and urban America alike is the fact that the communities themselves are pushing
980740	983600	back against their advance.
983600	988280	In response to the lack of pay and the danger inherent in working at Dollar General, employees
988280	993640	in 2023 protested around the company's headquarters in Goodlessville, Tennessee for better working
993640	994640	conditions.
994640	999620	In 2018, the city of Tulsa passed an ordinance to limit new dollar stores and instead encourage
999620	1001680	full-service grocery stores.
1001680	1006360	In the move's wake, 75 communities have blocked dollar store proposals and 54 cities
1006360	1009120	have enacted limits on dollar store development.
1009120	1013480	Of course, these numbers are minor in comparison to the tens of thousands of dollar stores
1013480	1019760	now spread across the US, but each case of grassroots pushback serves as a powerful rebuttal.
1019760	1023680	That these communities, now marked by the neon sign signaling that the rest of the world
1023680	1028760	has largely forgotten about them, are a problem, and enough of a problem to bring communities
1028760	1031100	together, to fight back.
1031100	1035780	Fundamentally, Dollar General and its close equivalents are simply following the economic
1035780	1041120	path of least resistance—they're outcompeting local businesses, and they're doing it fairly—but
1041120	1046580	that path of least resistance leaves a trail of destruction that disadvantages individuals.
1046580	1053100	That's because individuals' best interests can work against their best interests.
1053100	1057600	People prefer having a dollar store and a grocery store and shopping at both, but in
1057600	1061740	the process of doing what they prefer in the short term, they destroy that grocery
1061740	1066700	store and create a scenario that is less desirable for themselves in the long term.
1066700	1070980	So, that's what government is for—it's an assembly of individuals into a collective
1070980	1076080	that can solve these strange mismatches between two sets of best interests.
1076080	1079180	The American Main Street is a fragile environment.
1079180	1084500	It's already taken a beating as big box retailers built up across the country, but
1084500	1086660	that battle was fought from a distance.
1086660	1091080	The one thing Walmart couldn't compete with was the locational convenience of small-town
1091080	1094160	stores for small towns.
1094160	1096480	Dollar General can, and it is.
1096480	1102560	It's got a simple yet unbeatable business model, it's a black hole that sucks up variety
1102560	1111480	and vitality, and litters the American landscape with these perfectly destructive beige boxes.
1111480	1114960	Something I've noticed is that, despite being a very busy person, I always seem to
1114960	1119100	have small little gaps in my day where I end up just scrolling Twitter or TikTok or
1119100	1123060	Reddit, and while that's fine in moderation, I find myself using the excuse of I don't
1123060	1126540	have time for why I don't do certain things that I genuinely want to do.
1126540	1130180	That's why I'm such a big fan of our sponsor, Brilliant.
1130180	1133820	One of the things I want to do is learn new things, but that's often pretty tough to
1133820	1136380	do without a big block of open time.
1136380	1141020	But Brilliant designed these fantastic, interactive courses on STEM subjects that are broken down
1141020	1145340	into bite-sized chunks, so you can legitimately fit learning something like astrophysics
1145340	1147780	into basically any schedule.
1147780	1152660	And again, the courses are legitimately well-designed, so you're actually engaged and you actually
1152660	1156800	learn stuff since they break big concepts down into their intuitive base principles,
1156800	1159460	then bring them back together progressively as you go.
1159460	1163640	I find it so satisfying to learn something new, especially when it's something I never
1163640	1168680	could have imagined having a grasp on like calculus or complex numbers or quantum science.
1168680	1172080	Basically, if you're the kind of person that likes challenging yourself to learning
1172080	1176800	new things, Brilliant is for you, so you should go to brilliant.org slash wendover to try
1176800	1180520	everything Brilliant has to offer free for a full 30 days.
1180520	1185980	Plus, the first 200 to use that link will also get 20% off Brilliant's annual premium
1185980	1186480	subscription.
