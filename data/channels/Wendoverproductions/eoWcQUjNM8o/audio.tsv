0	6160	For three June days, the epicenter of the creator economy coalesced here, in the heart
6160	8440	of sprawling Southern California.
8440	12300	Gone for three years, the return of VidCon to the Anaheim Convention Center was a big
12300	13300	deal.
13300	16720	Since its inaugural year, piloted by John and Hank Green on a tight budget and attended
16720	21400	by a thousand and change in a Hyatt basement in 2010, each VidCon, effectively mirroring
21400	24800	the growing industry itself, has one-upped the last.
24800	29560	Former attendees, bigger creators, and glitzier booths each year became the norm from 2010
29560	30960	to 2019.
30960	34080	Considering such an upward trajectory, along with the growth of the creator industry in
34080	39540	its absence, this VidCon was much anticipated, and broadly, it didn't disappoint.
39540	42500	It was, however, different.
42500	46320	Like VidCons before, companies competed for attention with photo booths, free snacks,
46320	50600	and interactive attractions, fans showed up in droves, and creators pulled healthy audiences
50600	55800	to schedule talks, but it felt different, and major media outlets took note.
55800	59960	Many identified the change in presenting sponsor from YouTube to TikTok as a potential changing
59960	64740	of the guard, while others noted a relative dearth of big-name YouTubers in attendance.
64740	69020	What everyone covering the event missed was perhaps the biggest change of all.
69020	72920	Away from the conference floor itself, and tucked away upstairs and off-site, platforms,
72920	77640	companies, and agencies quietly competed for creators' attention in exclusive, backstage
77640	82880	lounges and parties set up by the likes of Meta, Jellysmack, YouTube, Carrot, and Snapchat.
82880	88680	In the three-year absence, the creator economy had grown into a matured, diversified, $100
88680	90680	billion business.
90680	94280	But behind all the pomp and circumstance of the big events, the stiff competition between
94280	98300	the different platforms, and the wining and dining by agencies, companies, and brands
98300	101840	is of course the creator, their content, and their income.
101840	107160	As an example, let's say there's a YouTube creator with 2 million subscribers who averages
107160	108840	1 million views per video.
108840	111520	How do they make money, and how much?
111520	115880	The well-known core of any YouTuber's income is AdSense—the system that serves the ads
115880	118760	before, during, and after videos.
118760	122720	This hypothetical channel could expect to earn about $4,000 in AdSense revenue for their
122720	127560	million views, based on a typical revenue per meal rate, or RPM, of $4—meaning they
127560	129800	earn $4 per thousand views.
129800	135040	However, there is wild inconsistency on AdSense RPMs from creator to creator.
135040	139040	The AdSense system's selling point for advertisers is its ability to target ads to
139040	143200	be served to audiences with particular geographies, demographics, or interests.
143200	148640	So, creator income all has to do with how valuable their audience is to advertisers.
148640	152240	Advertisers only pay one-fifth the average to reach customers in Brazil, likely as Brazilian
152240	156540	spending power is lower, so if our hypothetical channel was produced in Portuguese, and therefore
156540	160320	had a big chunk of its audience in Brazil, it likely would earn a lower than average
160320	161320	RPM.
161320	165120	On those million views, the creator might only earn $1,200.
165120	170120	Meanwhile, advertisers value audiences with particular interests quite highly.
170120	173900	Creators making videos about business or finance tend to have quite high RPMs, because there
173900	177860	are loads of investment platforms, banks, crypto companies, and others competing to
177860	181840	get those valuable advertising spots seen by an older, wealthier, financially savvy
181840	182840	audience.
182840	187060	If our creator made a US-based, English-language personal finance channel, they might earn
187060	190040	$8,000 in AdSense on those million views.
190040	194460	But for the sake of realism, let's assume the average—let's assume a $4 RPM, translating
194460	196680	to $4,000 in AdSense income.
196680	201800	But there's plenty of opportunity to dramatically grow the value of those million views.
201800	206720	Perhaps the most common is sponsorship—early into the development of the creator economy,
206720	208800	advertising agencies notice something.
208800	213340	The most effective means of selling something off of the attention a creator's work attracts
213340	215440	is through the creator.
215440	220740	Using a 45-second externally produced AdSense ad before the video versus a 45-second sponsorship
220740	226120	voiced by the creator at the end, the latter overwhelmingly leads to more sign-ups.
226120	230800	With this recognition, the influencer marketing business was born.
230800	233880	Influencer marketing is a little more complex than AdSense.
233880	238280	Typically, YouTube sponsorship is used by brands looking for sign-ups—it's conversion
238280	239780	marketing, not awareness marketing.
239780	243400	You wouldn't expect Coke, for example, to sponsor a YouTube video, because their marketing
243400	247720	focuses on assuring people think about Coke so they buy it when the opportunity arises,
247720	251300	rather than getting people to buy a Coke at that exact moment.
251300	255400	More often than not, the companies that do find YouTuber influencer marketing worthwhile
255400	260160	are either Online Subscription Services, Audible, CuriosityStream, Squarespace, BetterHelp,
260160	264840	or direct-to-consumer subscription brands—HelloFresh, Dollar Shave Club, Shaker, and Spoon.
264840	268960	With the subscription model boosting the lifetime value of an individual customer, Dollar Shave
268960	273200	Club can afford to spend more to get a given customer than Gillette, for example.
273200	277200	Why this works for them is because of that link in the description.
277200	281560	Most sponsorships include a certain percent discount when users sign up through the creator's
281560	282560	dedicated link.
282560	286120	Not only does this drive increased performance, but it also assures that the hugely valuable
286120	290760	data tracking an individual spot's effectiveness stays accurate as it incentivizes users to
290760	294760	follow the dedicated link rather than the primary sign-up flow.
294760	299480	Almost every brand.com slash creator link operates as a tracking URL, capturing data
299480	303280	about how many people click through, how many people sign up, and even how long these
303280	305640	sign-ups stick around as customers.
305640	309680	These individualized data allow for a level of optimization far above what's possible
309680	314220	with TV, radio, or billboards, and provide a simple mechanism to monitor whether the
314220	317540	campaign is actually providing a return on investment.
317540	321620	But what these data have also illuminated is the huge degree of spread in the worth
321620	323720	of a view from creator to creator.
323720	328920	What influences this more than anything is the strength of the parasocial relationship.
328920	332780	Parasocial relationships are a well-documented psychological phenomena where individuals
332780	336720	start to feel as if they have a genuine relationship with a personality that they have repeated
336720	341500	exposure to through media, even when they have never met or interacted with said personality.
341500	345380	People trust their friends, and so they also trust those that they have a parasocial relationship
345380	346380	with.
346380	351360	Therefore, the stronger the parasocial relationship, the more effective a given call to action
351360	352360	is.
352360	357620	YouTube creators can and do make certain content decisions to improve the parasocial relationship—being
357620	362120	on camera boosts it, so does injecting more personality into videos—speaking in a less-scripted
362120	363560	manner does too.
363560	367340	Even keeping visual quality relatively simple has proved successful in boosting the parasocial
367340	371320	relationship as it can help make videos feel like they're made by a person rather than
371320	372720	a company.
372720	377740	For creators, the process of figuring out what a given sponsorship is worth is complicated.
377740	381360	It all starts, of course, with the sponsor, but most companies' marketing divisions
381360	385840	are set up to write big checks to outside ad agencies that design and execute a given
385840	386840	campaign.
387060	390380	Even with individual YouTube sponsorships running well into the tens or even hundreds
390380	394220	of thousands of dollars, these companies are used to working in the millions, so they generally
394220	398540	contract a specialized influencer marketing agency like Semaphore, the OutLoud Group,
398540	401760	or Veritone One to divide up the check and run the campaign.
401760	406060	If a personal finance app is running a $2 million campaign with a $35 target cost per
406060	411100	acquisition, the agency's job is to properly price, book, and manage the individual spots
411100	416060	to drive 57,143 or more conversions into paying customers.
416060	419760	The performance variability for sponsorships is even greater than that of AdSense, but
419760	424520	with this sort of target CPA and this sort of product, creators often range between 500
424520	426600	and 5,000 views per conversion.
426600	430440	An agency might see that our hypothetical channel averages a million views and would
430440	435800	therefore likely drive about 400 conversions, so based on the $35 CPA, the creator probably
435800	439360	deserves about $14,000 for a sponsorship.
439360	443960	However, in practice, the creator only sees some of that.
443960	448940	Agencies can typically charge whatever commission they want—while taking 10 or 20% is common,
448940	454080	they could take 30 or 40% too as long as they can find creators willing to accept that offer.
454080	457700	In fact, they don't even need to disclose what commission they take—they could just
457700	459800	offer the number post-commission.
459800	465580	In practice, well-established major agencies have been found taking 50% commissions without
465580	469980	disclosure, meaning on that $14,000 spot, they'd keep $7,000.
470000	475800	There's also not a strong market mechanism to assure that prices stay correlated to performance.
475800	479540	Most agencies and sponsors keep the data to themselves, so if a creator's sponsorship
479540	484220	performance improves, as it often does through time as the parasocial relationship deepens,
484220	488800	prices only adjust if the agency agrees to it, and only the agency typically knows if
488800	492140	the performance has truly improved enough to justify it.
492140	495340	Agencies will boost rates if they're worried the creator will turn down the offer, but
495340	499740	the power dynamic is undoubtedly weighted towards the agency's side and contractually,
499740	502620	they typically work for the brand, not the creator.
502620	506060	While larger creators have managers or agents who know how much their clients' sponsorship
506060	511180	slots are truly worth, younger or newer creators often have zero idea and have not yet established
511180	513740	a network of colleagues with whom they can gut-check rates.
513740	517620	They're therefore in a prime position to be taken advantage of at the exact moment
517620	522480	when they feel like their dreams are being fulfilled—$7,000 sounds amazing, until you
522480	525500	find out it started as $14,000.
525500	529560	Of course, YouTube isn't the only platform where creators are now making a living.
529560	533780	Twitch, Meta, TikTok, and Snap have each recognized that their platforms only go as far as the
533780	538440	creators they attract, and this recognition has effectively started a race for talent.
538440	543320	And again, this year's VidCon offers hints as to how this race is playing out.
543320	548040	The fact that a panel dedicated to demystifying the algorithm with Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast,
548040	552320	and Todd Bupri, YouTube's Director of Product Management, reached maximum venue capacity
552320	554860	speaks to the platform's continued pull.
554860	558040	As one attendee explained, while they had developed a TikTok profile with more than
558040	561800	half a million followers, they were at the panel because they wanted the stable income
561800	563560	that YouTube could provide.
563560	568240	TikTok might be taking off, but at this point, YouTube still holds an important advantage,
568240	571200	and it's one that's grounded in the platform's past.
571200	575200	By 2011, the year Snapchat was founded and Twitch was launched as the gaming offshoot
575200	579900	of Justin.tv, YouTube had surpassed three billion views a day and had begun experimenting
579900	582640	with monetizing channels beyond exclusive partners.
582640	587260	A year later, it opened the YouTube Partner Program to everyone, allowing all creators
587260	591500	an opportunity to make money off their products—a remarkably prescient recognition that the
591500	595000	platform only went as far as the creators populating it.
595000	600080	Then, in 2013, an ascended platform threatened to undercut YouTube the way Twitter had undercut
600080	602640	blogs—by promoting short form.
602640	606920	Vine's simple interface and its adherence to a strict six seconds cap on videos took
606920	612640	off, making it the fastest growing app in 2013 and home to 200 million monthly users
612640	613640	in 2015.
613640	618720	The only problem was that neither the platform nor its popular creators could make money.
618720	622800	Vine fostered talent and developed fame, but nobody could figure out how to build any sort
622800	626600	of monetizable rapport with an audience in only six seconds.
626600	631920	Instead, advertisers and creators pivoted to more expensive platforms like YouTube and
632600	636520	Within this early wave of potential YouTube competitors, it was only Twitch that figured
636520	641960	out how to successfully monetize the platform in a manner that attracted and retained talent.
641960	645680	With video game streaming personalities as Twitch's main draw, keeping talent on the
645680	649120	platform was of life-or-death importance to the site.
649120	652880	Along with the option to run ads on their streams, Twitch kept its creators by developing
652880	657520	a host of revenue-generating routes that included memberships, donations, affiliate links, and
657520	660400	direct paid subscriptions to their favorite channels.
660400	664280	This approach has turned the platform into one of the industry's most powerful as roughly
664280	670240	300,000 of the 2 million self-identified professional creators exist primarily on Twitch.
670240	674720	While YouTube and Twitch proved the commercial viability of long-form video and streaming,
674720	679280	recognizing the unmet potential of short-form has proved both alluring and elusive.
679280	684720	The very same year that Vine officially shut down, TikTok appeared in American app stores.
684720	690040	The rise of the Vine-like, easy-to-use, hyper-creative, hyper-consumable platform hasn't been anything
690040	691840	short of meteoric.
691840	699280	In Q1 of 2021, TikTok was downloaded 315 million times worldwide—the most of any app in a
699280	700840	quarter ever.
700840	705280	And yet, for the vast majority of TikTok creators without powerful brand partnerships, making
705280	708920	consistent money through their success on the app is difficult.
708920	712540	Paid music promotions from record labels, sponsored posts, and cash gifts direct from
712540	716800	audiences during livestreams offer little stability and limited growth potential.
716800	721840	To alleviate some of the monetization pains, TikTok introduced a $200 million dollar creator
721840	726800	fund in 2020, but because TikTok uses in-feed ads, it's difficult to attribute the success
726800	731260	of an advertisement to a given creator and thus, difficult to dole out payment in relation
731260	732260	to performance.
732260	736320	Additionally, with the fund having a hard cap, the more successful creators inhabit
736320	739840	the ecosystem, the fewer dollars there are to spread around.
739840	743800	As Hank Green pointed out, because of this static pool and the app's continued growth,
743800	749160	his TikToks, as of January of 2022, made about two and a half cents per thousand views—a
749160	753240	worryingly low number by itself, but one made increasingly troubling by the fact that he
753240	756440	used to make five cents per thousand views.
756440	760620	TikTokers are making money, but it's a dollar hard-earned, leaving the door ajar in the
760620	763360	race for their users' creative output.
763360	768880	In 2020, Meta launched Reels, Snap launched Spotlight, and YouTube launched YouTube Shorts—all
768880	772400	were new features that closely resembled TikTok.
772400	777540	In the year following its launch, Spotlight paid out over $250 million from its creator
777540	778540	fund.
778540	783920	In 2021, Meta announced plans to invest $1 billion in its Facebook and Instagram creators,
783920	786740	including a bonus program for Reels based on performance.
786740	792600	As of 2022, though, the future of short-form video is still very much up in the air.
792600	797540	What is certain is that creators today have more options than ever before, and thus, more
797540	799480	leverage than ever before.
799480	803520	With various platforms that cover various mediums at their disposal, financially successful
803520	808420	creators have gone from being thought of as multimedia aberrations in the 2010s to ever-critical
808420	813480	cogs in a growing industry where entertainment and advertisement so seamlessly overlap.
813480	817340	Creators of all sizes are spreading from one platform to multiple, and some are beginning
817340	820520	to move beyond platforms entirely.
820520	825960	Combining $4,000 in AdSense with $11,200 in sponsorship, our hypothetical creator currently
825960	831880	makes about 1.5 cents per view, but simultaneously, both the agency and Google are making about
831880	836960	0.3 cents on the same view, and then on top of that, the sponsors and advertisers are
836960	839440	making more on the profit the marketing generates.
839440	843520	While it's impossible to know the exact number, it's very possible that each of
843520	847680	these creators' views is generating three cents in economic value, and they're only
847680	849600	getting half of it.
849600	853280	While shared profits are a normal part of doing business, creators have recognized that
853280	856760	the more of those three cents they capture, the more they earn.
856760	861500	In practice, what this looks like is creators becoming their own sponsors.
861500	865860	It started with merch—channels would slap their logo on a shirt or hat or sticker and
865860	866860	sell it.
866860	870080	Some people bought these, but often just the most devoted fans.
870080	874760	Our creator that could get $11,200 in sponsorship would likely only earn one or two thousand
874760	877720	dollars from replacing that sponsor segment with a merch shoutout.
877720	881480	In response, creators adapted their merchandise more into clothing lines.
881640	884080	Logan Paul, for example, runs Maverick Clothing.
884080	887400	With clothing brands competing against other clothing brands, this operates more like a
887400	891460	business than merchandise, so creators often find this strategy far more effective and
891460	894940	sometimes competitive in performance versus an outside sponsor.
894940	899080	Logan Paul claimed his brand made between $30 and $40 million in its first year, while
899080	903780	our channel might expect to profit around the same $11,200 from promoting its clothing
903780	905560	brand as with an outside sponsor.
905560	909320	Taking this to the next level, the predominant trend of the past few years has been creators
909320	911920	launching fully-fledged businesses.
911920	915300	Mr. Beast started selling burgers cooked by Ghost Kitchens on food delivery apps under
915300	920040	the Mr. Beast Burger brand, which has since expanded to over 1,000 locations in the US,
920040	921880	Canada, UK, and UAE.
921880	925920	Mark Rober and Vsauce started subscription box companies called Crunchlabs and the Curiosity
925920	927280	Box, respectively.
927280	930640	Johnny Harris co-founded a travel course platform called Bright Trip.
930640	933920	The Nilk Boys launched their Happy Dad brand of hard seltzer.
933920	936640	Simone Geertz created the Everyday Goal Calendar.
936640	939920	Even Wendover Productions co-founded the Nebula Streaming Service, which operates as
939920	943360	an equity joint venture with the creators contributing to the platform—a fact that
943360	946640	is made clear in its ads for good reason—it works.
946640	949860	Across the board, what creators have found is that not only do they get to keep more
949860	954000	of those three cents per view, but also that a given viewer is more likely to convert into
954000	957560	a paying customer when the sponsorship is presented as promoting their own business
957560	958880	rather than the highest bidder.
958880	963360	That's to say, not only are creators getting more of the pie, they're also expanding
963360	964360	it.
964360	968880	The three cents per view might become four, and therefore it was an $11.2,000 sponsorship
968880	972420	on a million views might become $28,000.
972420	978240	With $32,000 in total income on that one hypothetical million view video, this hypothetical creator
978240	982100	has effectively earned 3.2 cents per view.
982100	985680	This is orders of magnitude more than they would have earned on the same view a decade
985680	989480	ago, and yet more orders of magnitude more than they would have earned from a view on
989480	992420	Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or elsewhere.
992420	996480	This is how YouTube creators are now able to go full-time, making channels that previously
996480	997960	would have been but a hobby.
997960	1002060	Newer creators tend to have less optimized channels, but even assuming 1.5 cents per
1002060	1007340	view, bi-weekly releases of videos achieving 150,000 average views would provide about
1007340	1009500	$4,000 in monthly income.
1009500	1014460	Simultaneously, it's these same figures that allow the absolute largest creators—Mr.
1014460	1018260	Beast, the Paul brothers, Markiplier, and others—to generate wealth rivaling that
1018260	1021180	made in the mainstream entertainment industry.
1021180	1023900	This is YouTube's competitive advantage.
1023900	1028540	YouTuber is now regularly ranked as one of kids' top dream jobs—up there with professional
1028540	1031100	athlete, firefighter, and veterinarian.
1031100	1035200	With a massive pinnacle to the dream and a relatively achievable entry point, creative
1035200	1039660	people will keep choosing YouTube as their platform of choice over TikTok, Instagram,
1039660	1043760	Twitter, or any other social site because as the other platforms are attempting to get
1043760	1048300	creators to work for less, YouTube, through the years, has successfully developed a platform
1048300	1052900	that earns creators more and more and more.
1052900	1054960	Of course, you know what's coming next.
1054960	1058900	This video, along with the payroll expenses, contractor bills, insurance payments, footage
1058900	1064140	licensing fees, office lease costs, administrative expenses, and every other unsexy cost that
1064140	1068860	goes into delivering you viewers what you've just seen, was truly, genuinely made possible
1068860	1071080	by our sponsor, Hover.
1071080	1074740	One of the reasons I love Hover is because they focus on one thing and just do it really
1074740	1075740	well.
1075740	1079060	Hover is the best place to buy domains for your website or email, and I know that they're
1079060	1082020	the best because I've bought dozens of domains for them over the years.
1082020	1085500	Recently, as I was sitting with my writers brainstorming a name for a new channel, I
1085500	1089100	had my laptop sitting in front of me with Hover open, searching which domain names were
1089100	1090100	available.
1090100	1094220	As soon as we settled on the name Jetlag The Game, I used Hover to buy jetlagthegame.com,
1094220	1099580	which took less than 30 seconds and cost a very reasonable $15.99 a year.
1099580	1103040	Through the years, any time I had a technical question or issue, their support picked up
1103040	1105660	immediately and figured out the solution right away.
1105660	1109420	Again, Hover is simple—they sell domains quickly, for a fair price, and help you with
1109420	1113660	managing it through the years, so if you have a name for a YouTube channel, business, organization,
1113660	1117900	or anything else and want to lock it down for a future website or custom email address,
1117900	1119480	you should buy the domain with Hover.
1119480	1124780	They also have over 400 domain extensions so you can get unique domains like our wendover.productions
1124780	1125780	one.
1125780	1128420	If that's not enough, by clicking the button on screen or heading to our link, hover.com
1128420	1132420	slash wendover, you'll get 10% off and as you now know so well, you'll be supporting
1132420	1134340	Wendover while you're at it.
