00:00.000 --> 00:06.160
For three June days, the epicenter of the creator economy coalesced here, in the heart

00:06.160 --> 00:08.440
of sprawling Southern California.

00:08.440 --> 00:12.300
Gone for three years, the return of VidCon to the Anaheim Convention Center was a big

00:12.300 --> 00:13.300
deal.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.720
Since its inaugural year, piloted by John and Hank Green on a tight budget and attended

00:16.720 --> 00:21.400
by a thousand and change in a Hyatt basement in 2010, each VidCon, effectively mirroring

00:21.400 --> 00:24.800
the growing industry itself, has one-upped the last.

00:24.800 --> 00:29.560
Former attendees, bigger creators, and glitzier booths each year became the norm from 2010

00:29.560 --> 00:30.960
to 2019.

00:30.960 --> 00:34.080
Considering such an upward trajectory, along with the growth of the creator industry in

00:34.080 --> 00:39.540
its absence, this VidCon was much anticipated, and broadly, it didn't disappoint.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.500
It was, however, different.

00:42.500 --> 00:46.320
Like VidCons before, companies competed for attention with photo booths, free snacks,

00:46.320 --> 00:50.600
and interactive attractions, fans showed up in droves, and creators pulled healthy audiences

00:50.600 --> 00:55.800
to schedule talks, but it felt different, and major media outlets took note.

00:55.800 --> 00:59.960
Many identified the change in presenting sponsor from YouTube to TikTok as a potential changing

00:59.960 --> 01:04.740
of the guard, while others noted a relative dearth of big-name YouTubers in attendance.

01:04.740 --> 01:09.020
What everyone covering the event missed was perhaps the biggest change of all.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.920
Away from the conference floor itself, and tucked away upstairs and off-site, platforms,

01:12.920 --> 01:17.640
companies, and agencies quietly competed for creators' attention in exclusive, backstage

01:17.640 --> 01:22.880
lounges and parties set up by the likes of Meta, Jellysmack, YouTube, Carrot, and Snapchat.

01:22.880 --> 01:28.680
In the three-year absence, the creator economy had grown into a matured, diversified, $100

01:28.680 --> 01:30.680
billion business.

01:30.680 --> 01:34.280
But behind all the pomp and circumstance of the big events, the stiff competition between

01:34.280 --> 01:38.300
the different platforms, and the wining and dining by agencies, companies, and brands

01:38.300 --> 01:41.840
is of course the creator, their content, and their income.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.160
As an example, let's say there's a YouTube creator with 2 million subscribers who averages

01:47.160 --> 01:48.840
1 million views per video.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.520
How do they make money, and how much?

01:51.520 --> 01:55.880
The well-known core of any YouTuber's income is AdSense—the system that serves the ads

01:55.880 --> 01:58.760
before, during, and after videos.

01:58.760 --> 02:02.720
This hypothetical channel could expect to earn about $4,000 in AdSense revenue for their

02:02.720 --> 02:07.560
million views, based on a typical revenue per meal rate, or RPM, of $4—meaning they

02:07.560 --> 02:09.800
earn $4 per thousand views.

02:09.800 --> 02:15.040
However, there is wild inconsistency on AdSense RPMs from creator to creator.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.040
The AdSense system's selling point for advertisers is its ability to target ads to

02:19.040 --> 02:23.200
be served to audiences with particular geographies, demographics, or interests.

02:23.200 --> 02:28.640
So, creator income all has to do with how valuable their audience is to advertisers.

02:28.640 --> 02:32.240
Advertisers only pay one-fifth the average to reach customers in Brazil, likely as Brazilian

02:32.240 --> 02:36.540
spending power is lower, so if our hypothetical channel was produced in Portuguese, and therefore

02:36.540 --> 02:40.320
had a big chunk of its audience in Brazil, it likely would earn a lower than average

02:40.320 --> 02:41.320
RPM.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.120
On those million views, the creator might only earn $1,200.

02:45.120 --> 02:50.120
Meanwhile, advertisers value audiences with particular interests quite highly.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.900
Creators making videos about business or finance tend to have quite high RPMs, because there

02:53.900 --> 02:57.860
are loads of investment platforms, banks, crypto companies, and others competing to

02:57.860 --> 03:01.840
get those valuable advertising spots seen by an older, wealthier, financially savvy

03:01.840 --> 03:02.840
audience.

03:02.840 --> 03:07.060
If our creator made a US-based, English-language personal finance channel, they might earn

03:07.060 --> 03:10.040
$8,000 in AdSense on those million views.

03:10.040 --> 03:14.460
But for the sake of realism, let's assume the average—let's assume a $4 RPM, translating

03:14.460 --> 03:16.680
to $4,000 in AdSense income.

03:16.680 --> 03:21.800
But there's plenty of opportunity to dramatically grow the value of those million views.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.720
Perhaps the most common is sponsorship—early into the development of the creator economy,

03:26.720 --> 03:28.800
advertising agencies notice something.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.340
The most effective means of selling something off of the attention a creator's work attracts

03:33.340 --> 03:35.440
is through the creator.

03:35.440 --> 03:40.740
Using a 45-second externally produced AdSense ad before the video versus a 45-second sponsorship

03:40.740 --> 03:46.120
voiced by the creator at the end, the latter overwhelmingly leads to more sign-ups.

03:46.120 --> 03:50.800
With this recognition, the influencer marketing business was born.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.880
Influencer marketing is a little more complex than AdSense.

03:53.880 --> 03:58.280
Typically, YouTube sponsorship is used by brands looking for sign-ups—it's conversion

03:58.280 --> 03:59.780
marketing, not awareness marketing.

03:59.780 --> 04:03.400
You wouldn't expect Coke, for example, to sponsor a YouTube video, because their marketing

04:03.400 --> 04:07.720
focuses on assuring people think about Coke so they buy it when the opportunity arises,

04:07.720 --> 04:11.300
rather than getting people to buy a Coke at that exact moment.

04:11.300 --> 04:15.400
More often than not, the companies that do find YouTuber influencer marketing worthwhile

04:15.400 --> 04:20.160
are either Online Subscription Services, Audible, CuriosityStream, Squarespace, BetterHelp,

04:20.160 --> 04:24.840
or direct-to-consumer subscription brands—HelloFresh, Dollar Shave Club, Shaker, and Spoon.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.960
With the subscription model boosting the lifetime value of an individual customer, Dollar Shave

04:28.960 --> 04:33.200
Club can afford to spend more to get a given customer than Gillette, for example.

04:33.200 --> 04:37.200
Why this works for them is because of that link in the description.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.560
Most sponsorships include a certain percent discount when users sign up through the creator's

04:41.560 --> 04:42.560
dedicated link.

04:42.560 --> 04:46.120
Not only does this drive increased performance, but it also assures that the hugely valuable

04:46.120 --> 04:50.760
data tracking an individual spot's effectiveness stays accurate as it incentivizes users to

04:50.760 --> 04:54.760
follow the dedicated link rather than the primary sign-up flow.

04:54.760 --> 04:59.480
Almost every brand.com slash creator link operates as a tracking URL, capturing data

04:59.480 --> 05:03.280
about how many people click through, how many people sign up, and even how long these

05:03.280 --> 05:05.640
sign-ups stick around as customers.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.680
These individualized data allow for a level of optimization far above what's possible

05:09.680 --> 05:14.220
with TV, radio, or billboards, and provide a simple mechanism to monitor whether the

05:14.220 --> 05:17.540
campaign is actually providing a return on investment.

05:17.540 --> 05:21.620
But what these data have also illuminated is the huge degree of spread in the worth

05:21.620 --> 05:23.720
of a view from creator to creator.

05:23.720 --> 05:28.920
What influences this more than anything is the strength of the parasocial relationship.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.780
Parasocial relationships are a well-documented psychological phenomena where individuals

05:32.780 --> 05:36.720
start to feel as if they have a genuine relationship with a personality that they have repeated

05:36.720 --> 05:41.500
exposure to through media, even when they have never met or interacted with said personality.

05:41.500 --> 05:45.380
People trust their friends, and so they also trust those that they have a parasocial relationship

05:45.380 --> 05:46.380
with.

05:46.380 --> 05:51.360
Therefore, the stronger the parasocial relationship, the more effective a given call to action

05:51.360 --> 05:52.360
is.

05:52.360 --> 05:57.620
YouTube creators can and do make certain content decisions to improve the parasocial relationship—being

05:57.620 --> 06:02.120
on camera boosts it, so does injecting more personality into videos—speaking in a less-scripted

06:02.120 --> 06:03.560
manner does too.

06:03.560 --> 06:07.340
Even keeping visual quality relatively simple has proved successful in boosting the parasocial

06:07.340 --> 06:11.320
relationship as it can help make videos feel like they're made by a person rather than

06:11.320 --> 06:12.720
a company.

06:12.720 --> 06:17.740
For creators, the process of figuring out what a given sponsorship is worth is complicated.

06:17.740 --> 06:21.360
It all starts, of course, with the sponsor, but most companies' marketing divisions

06:21.360 --> 06:25.840
are set up to write big checks to outside ad agencies that design and execute a given

06:25.840 --> 06:26.840
campaign.

06:27.060 --> 06:30.380
Even with individual YouTube sponsorships running well into the tens or even hundreds

06:30.380 --> 06:34.220
of thousands of dollars, these companies are used to working in the millions, so they generally

06:34.220 --> 06:38.540
contract a specialized influencer marketing agency like Semaphore, the OutLoud Group,

06:38.540 --> 06:41.760
or Veritone One to divide up the check and run the campaign.

06:41.760 --> 06:46.060
If a personal finance app is running a $2 million campaign with a $35 target cost per

06:46.060 --> 06:51.100
acquisition, the agency's job is to properly price, book, and manage the individual spots

06:51.100 --> 06:56.060
to drive 57,143 or more conversions into paying customers.

06:56.060 --> 06:59.760
The performance variability for sponsorships is even greater than that of AdSense, but

06:59.760 --> 07:04.520
with this sort of target CPA and this sort of product, creators often range between 500

07:04.520 --> 07:06.600
and 5,000 views per conversion.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.440
An agency might see that our hypothetical channel averages a million views and would

07:10.440 --> 07:15.800
therefore likely drive about 400 conversions, so based on the $35 CPA, the creator probably

07:15.800 --> 07:19.360
deserves about $14,000 for a sponsorship.

07:19.360 --> 07:23.960
However, in practice, the creator only sees some of that.

07:23.960 --> 07:28.940
Agencies can typically charge whatever commission they want—while taking 10 or 20% is common,

07:28.940 --> 07:34.080
they could take 30 or 40% too as long as they can find creators willing to accept that offer.

07:34.080 --> 07:37.700
In fact, they don't even need to disclose what commission they take—they could just

07:37.700 --> 07:39.800
offer the number post-commission.

07:39.800 --> 07:45.580
In practice, well-established major agencies have been found taking 50% commissions without

07:45.580 --> 07:49.980
disclosure, meaning on that $14,000 spot, they'd keep $7,000.

07:50.000 --> 07:55.800
There's also not a strong market mechanism to assure that prices stay correlated to performance.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.540
Most agencies and sponsors keep the data to themselves, so if a creator's sponsorship

07:59.540 --> 08:04.220
performance improves, as it often does through time as the parasocial relationship deepens,

08:04.220 --> 08:08.800
prices only adjust if the agency agrees to it, and only the agency typically knows if

08:08.800 --> 08:12.140
the performance has truly improved enough to justify it.

08:12.140 --> 08:15.340
Agencies will boost rates if they're worried the creator will turn down the offer, but

08:15.340 --> 08:19.740
the power dynamic is undoubtedly weighted towards the agency's side and contractually,

08:19.740 --> 08:22.620
they typically work for the brand, not the creator.

08:22.620 --> 08:26.060
While larger creators have managers or agents who know how much their clients' sponsorship

08:26.060 --> 08:31.180
slots are truly worth, younger or newer creators often have zero idea and have not yet established

08:31.180 --> 08:33.740
a network of colleagues with whom they can gut-check rates.

08:33.740 --> 08:37.620
They're therefore in a prime position to be taken advantage of at the exact moment

08:37.620 --> 08:42.480
when they feel like their dreams are being fulfilled—$7,000 sounds amazing, until you

08:42.480 --> 08:45.500
find out it started as $14,000.

08:45.500 --> 08:49.560
Of course, YouTube isn't the only platform where creators are now making a living.

08:49.560 --> 08:53.780
Twitch, Meta, TikTok, and Snap have each recognized that their platforms only go as far as the

08:53.780 --> 08:58.440
creators they attract, and this recognition has effectively started a race for talent.

08:58.440 --> 09:03.320
And again, this year's VidCon offers hints as to how this race is playing out.

09:03.320 --> 09:08.040
The fact that a panel dedicated to demystifying the algorithm with Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast,

09:08.040 --> 09:12.320
and Todd Bupri, YouTube's Director of Product Management, reached maximum venue capacity

09:12.320 --> 09:14.860
speaks to the platform's continued pull.

09:14.860 --> 09:18.040
As one attendee explained, while they had developed a TikTok profile with more than

09:18.040 --> 09:21.800
half a million followers, they were at the panel because they wanted the stable income

09:21.800 --> 09:23.560
that YouTube could provide.

09:23.560 --> 09:28.240
TikTok might be taking off, but at this point, YouTube still holds an important advantage,

09:28.240 --> 09:31.200
and it's one that's grounded in the platform's past.

09:31.200 --> 09:35.200
By 2011, the year Snapchat was founded and Twitch was launched as the gaming offshoot

09:35.200 --> 09:39.900
of Justin.tv, YouTube had surpassed three billion views a day and had begun experimenting

09:39.900 --> 09:42.640
with monetizing channels beyond exclusive partners.

09:42.640 --> 09:47.260
A year later, it opened the YouTube Partner Program to everyone, allowing all creators

09:47.260 --> 09:51.500
an opportunity to make money off their products—a remarkably prescient recognition that the

09:51.500 --> 09:55.000
platform only went as far as the creators populating it.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.080
Then, in 2013, an ascended platform threatened to undercut YouTube the way Twitter had undercut

10:00.080 --> 10:02.640
blogs—by promoting short form.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.920
Vine's simple interface and its adherence to a strict six seconds cap on videos took

10:06.920 --> 10:12.640
off, making it the fastest growing app in 2013 and home to 200 million monthly users

10:12.640 --> 10:13.640
in 2015.

10:13.640 --> 10:18.720
The only problem was that neither the platform nor its popular creators could make money.

10:18.720 --> 10:22.800
Vine fostered talent and developed fame, but nobody could figure out how to build any sort

10:22.800 --> 10:26.600
of monetizable rapport with an audience in only six seconds.

10:26.600 --> 10:31.920
Instead, advertisers and creators pivoted to more expensive platforms like YouTube and

10:32.600 --> 10:36.520
Within this early wave of potential YouTube competitors, it was only Twitch that figured

10:36.520 --> 10:41.960
out how to successfully monetize the platform in a manner that attracted and retained talent.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.680
With video game streaming personalities as Twitch's main draw, keeping talent on the

10:45.680 --> 10:49.120
platform was of life-or-death importance to the site.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.880
Along with the option to run ads on their streams, Twitch kept its creators by developing

10:52.880 --> 10:57.520
a host of revenue-generating routes that included memberships, donations, affiliate links, and

10:57.520 --> 11:00.400
direct paid subscriptions to their favorite channels.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.280
This approach has turned the platform into one of the industry's most powerful as roughly

11:04.280 --> 11:10.240
300,000 of the 2 million self-identified professional creators exist primarily on Twitch.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.720
While YouTube and Twitch proved the commercial viability of long-form video and streaming,

11:14.720 --> 11:19.280
recognizing the unmet potential of short-form has proved both alluring and elusive.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.720
The very same year that Vine officially shut down, TikTok appeared in American app stores.

11:24.720 --> 11:30.040
The rise of the Vine-like, easy-to-use, hyper-creative, hyper-consumable platform hasn't been anything

11:30.040 --> 11:31.840
short of meteoric.

11:31.840 --> 11:39.280
In Q1 of 2021, TikTok was downloaded 315 million times worldwide—the most of any app in a

11:39.280 --> 11:40.840
quarter ever.

11:40.840 --> 11:45.280
And yet, for the vast majority of TikTok creators without powerful brand partnerships, making

11:45.280 --> 11:48.920
consistent money through their success on the app is difficult.

11:48.920 --> 11:52.540
Paid music promotions from record labels, sponsored posts, and cash gifts direct from

11:52.540 --> 11:56.800
audiences during livestreams offer little stability and limited growth potential.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.840
To alleviate some of the monetization pains, TikTok introduced a $200 million dollar creator

12:01.840 --> 12:06.800
fund in 2020, but because TikTok uses in-feed ads, it's difficult to attribute the success

12:06.800 --> 12:11.260
of an advertisement to a given creator and thus, difficult to dole out payment in relation

12:11.260 --> 12:12.260
to performance.

12:12.260 --> 12:16.320
Additionally, with the fund having a hard cap, the more successful creators inhabit

12:16.320 --> 12:19.840
the ecosystem, the fewer dollars there are to spread around.

12:19.840 --> 12:23.800
As Hank Green pointed out, because of this static pool and the app's continued growth,

12:23.800 --> 12:29.160
his TikToks, as of January of 2022, made about two and a half cents per thousand views—a

12:29.160 --> 12:33.240
worryingly low number by itself, but one made increasingly troubling by the fact that he

12:33.240 --> 12:36.440
used to make five cents per thousand views.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.620
TikTokers are making money, but it's a dollar hard-earned, leaving the door ajar in the

12:40.620 --> 12:43.360
race for their users' creative output.

12:43.360 --> 12:48.880
In 2020, Meta launched Reels, Snap launched Spotlight, and YouTube launched YouTube Shorts—all

12:48.880 --> 12:52.400
were new features that closely resembled TikTok.

12:52.400 --> 12:57.540
In the year following its launch, Spotlight paid out over $250 million from its creator

12:57.540 --> 12:58.540
fund.

12:58.540 --> 13:03.920
In 2021, Meta announced plans to invest $1 billion in its Facebook and Instagram creators,

13:03.920 --> 13:06.740
including a bonus program for Reels based on performance.

13:06.740 --> 13:12.600
As of 2022, though, the future of short-form video is still very much up in the air.

13:12.600 --> 13:17.540
What is certain is that creators today have more options than ever before, and thus, more

13:17.540 --> 13:19.480
leverage than ever before.

13:19.480 --> 13:23.520
With various platforms that cover various mediums at their disposal, financially successful

13:23.520 --> 13:28.420
creators have gone from being thought of as multimedia aberrations in the 2010s to ever-critical

13:28.420 --> 13:33.480
cogs in a growing industry where entertainment and advertisement so seamlessly overlap.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.340
Creators of all sizes are spreading from one platform to multiple, and some are beginning

13:37.340 --> 13:40.520
to move beyond platforms entirely.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.960
Combining $4,000 in AdSense with $11,200 in sponsorship, our hypothetical creator currently

13:45.960 --> 13:51.880
makes about 1.5 cents per view, but simultaneously, both the agency and Google are making about

13:51.880 --> 13:56.960
0.3 cents on the same view, and then on top of that, the sponsors and advertisers are

13:56.960 --> 13:59.440
making more on the profit the marketing generates.

13:59.440 --> 14:03.520
While it's impossible to know the exact number, it's very possible that each of

14:03.520 --> 14:07.680
these creators' views is generating three cents in economic value, and they're only

14:07.680 --> 14:09.600
getting half of it.

14:09.600 --> 14:13.280
While shared profits are a normal part of doing business, creators have recognized that

14:13.280 --> 14:16.760
the more of those three cents they capture, the more they earn.

14:16.760 --> 14:21.500
In practice, what this looks like is creators becoming their own sponsors.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.860
It started with merch—channels would slap their logo on a shirt or hat or sticker and

14:25.860 --> 14:26.860
sell it.

14:26.860 --> 14:30.080
Some people bought these, but often just the most devoted fans.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.760
Our creator that could get $11,200 in sponsorship would likely only earn one or two thousand

14:34.760 --> 14:37.720
dollars from replacing that sponsor segment with a merch shoutout.

14:37.720 --> 14:41.480
In response, creators adapted their merchandise more into clothing lines.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.080
Logan Paul, for example, runs Maverick Clothing.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.400
With clothing brands competing against other clothing brands, this operates more like a

14:47.400 --> 14:51.460
business than merchandise, so creators often find this strategy far more effective and

14:51.460 --> 14:54.940
sometimes competitive in performance versus an outside sponsor.

14:54.940 --> 14:59.080
Logan Paul claimed his brand made between $30 and $40 million in its first year, while

14:59.080 --> 15:03.780
our channel might expect to profit around the same $11,200 from promoting its clothing

15:03.780 --> 15:05.560
brand as with an outside sponsor.

15:05.560 --> 15:09.320
Taking this to the next level, the predominant trend of the past few years has been creators

15:09.320 --> 15:11.920
launching fully-fledged businesses.

15:11.920 --> 15:15.300
Mr. Beast started selling burgers cooked by Ghost Kitchens on food delivery apps under

15:15.300 --> 15:20.040
the Mr. Beast Burger brand, which has since expanded to over 1,000 locations in the US,

15:20.040 --> 15:21.880
Canada, UK, and UAE.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.920
Mark Rober and Vsauce started subscription box companies called Crunchlabs and the Curiosity

15:25.920 --> 15:27.280
Box, respectively.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.640
Johnny Harris co-founded a travel course platform called Bright Trip.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.920
The Nilk Boys launched their Happy Dad brand of hard seltzer.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.640
Simone Geertz created the Everyday Goal Calendar.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.920
Even Wendover Productions co-founded the Nebula Streaming Service, which operates as

15:39.920 --> 15:43.360
an equity joint venture with the creators contributing to the platform—a fact that

15:43.360 --> 15:46.640
is made clear in its ads for good reason—it works.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.860
Across the board, what creators have found is that not only do they get to keep more

15:49.860 --> 15:54.000
of those three cents per view, but also that a given viewer is more likely to convert into

15:54.000 --> 15:57.560
a paying customer when the sponsorship is presented as promoting their own business

15:57.560 --> 15:58.880
rather than the highest bidder.

15:58.880 --> 16:03.360
That's to say, not only are creators getting more of the pie, they're also expanding

16:03.360 --> 16:04.360
it.

16:04.360 --> 16:08.880
The three cents per view might become four, and therefore it was an $11.2,000 sponsorship

16:08.880 --> 16:12.420
on a million views might become $28,000.

16:12.420 --> 16:18.240
With $32,000 in total income on that one hypothetical million view video, this hypothetical creator

16:18.240 --> 16:22.100
has effectively earned 3.2 cents per view.

16:22.100 --> 16:25.680
This is orders of magnitude more than they would have earned on the same view a decade

16:25.680 --> 16:29.480
ago, and yet more orders of magnitude more than they would have earned from a view on

16:29.480 --> 16:32.420
Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or elsewhere.

16:32.420 --> 16:36.480
This is how YouTube creators are now able to go full-time, making channels that previously

16:36.480 --> 16:37.960
would have been but a hobby.

16:37.960 --> 16:42.060
Newer creators tend to have less optimized channels, but even assuming 1.5 cents per

16:42.060 --> 16:47.340
view, bi-weekly releases of videos achieving 150,000 average views would provide about

16:47.340 --> 16:49.500
$4,000 in monthly income.

16:49.500 --> 16:54.460
Simultaneously, it's these same figures that allow the absolute largest creators—Mr.

16:54.460 --> 16:58.260
Beast, the Paul brothers, Markiplier, and others—to generate wealth rivaling that

16:58.260 --> 17:01.180
made in the mainstream entertainment industry.

17:01.180 --> 17:03.900
This is YouTube's competitive advantage.

17:03.900 --> 17:08.540
YouTuber is now regularly ranked as one of kids' top dream jobs—up there with professional

17:08.540 --> 17:11.100
athlete, firefighter, and veterinarian.

17:11.100 --> 17:15.200
With a massive pinnacle to the dream and a relatively achievable entry point, creative

17:15.200 --> 17:19.660
people will keep choosing YouTube as their platform of choice over TikTok, Instagram,

17:19.660 --> 17:23.760
Twitter, or any other social site because as the other platforms are attempting to get

17:23.760 --> 17:28.300
creators to work for less, YouTube, through the years, has successfully developed a platform

17:28.300 --> 17:32.900
that earns creators more and more and more.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.960
Of course, you know what's coming next.

17:34.960 --> 17:38.900
This video, along with the payroll expenses, contractor bills, insurance payments, footage

17:38.900 --> 17:44.140
licensing fees, office lease costs, administrative expenses, and every other unsexy cost that

17:44.140 --> 17:48.860
goes into delivering you viewers what you've just seen, was truly, genuinely made possible

17:48.860 --> 17:51.080
by our sponsor, Hover.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.740
One of the reasons I love Hover is because they focus on one thing and just do it really

17:54.740 --> 17:55.740
well.

17:55.740 --> 17:59.060
Hover is the best place to buy domains for your website or email, and I know that they're

17:59.060 --> 18:02.020
the best because I've bought dozens of domains for them over the years.

18:02.020 --> 18:05.500
Recently, as I was sitting with my writers brainstorming a name for a new channel, I

18:05.500 --> 18:09.100
had my laptop sitting in front of me with Hover open, searching which domain names were

18:09.100 --> 18:10.100
available.

18:10.100 --> 18:14.220
As soon as we settled on the name Jetlag The Game, I used Hover to buy jetlagthegame.com,

18:14.220 --> 18:19.580
which took less than 30 seconds and cost a very reasonable $15.99 a year.

18:19.580 --> 18:23.040
Through the years, any time I had a technical question or issue, their support picked up

18:23.040 --> 18:25.660
immediately and figured out the solution right away.

18:25.660 --> 18:29.420
Again, Hover is simple—they sell domains quickly, for a fair price, and help you with

18:29.420 --> 18:33.660
managing it through the years, so if you have a name for a YouTube channel, business, organization,

18:33.660 --> 18:37.900
or anything else and want to lock it down for a future website or custom email address,

18:37.900 --> 18:39.480
you should buy the domain with Hover.

18:39.480 --> 18:44.780
They also have over 400 domain extensions so you can get unique domains like our wendover.productions

18:44.780 --> 18:45.780
one.

18:45.780 --> 18:48.420
