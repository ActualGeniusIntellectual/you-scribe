00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
For three June days, the epicenter of the creator economy coalesced here, in the heart

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,440
of sprawling Southern California.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,300
Gone for three years, the return of VidCon to the Anaheim Convention Center was a big

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,300
deal.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,720
Since its inaugural year, piloted by John and Hank Green on a tight budget and attended

6
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,400
by a thousand and change in a Hyatt basement in 2010, each VidCon, effectively mirroring

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,800
the growing industry itself, has one-upped the last.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,560
Former attendees, bigger creators, and glitzier booths each year became the norm from 2010

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,960
to 2019.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,080
Considering such an upward trajectory, along with the growth of the creator industry in

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,540
its absence, this VidCon was much anticipated, and broadly, it didn't disappoint.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,500
It was, however, different.

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,320
Like VidCons before, companies competed for attention with photo booths, free snacks,

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,600
and interactive attractions, fans showed up in droves, and creators pulled healthy audiences

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,800
to schedule talks, but it felt different, and major media outlets took note.

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,960
Many identified the change in presenting sponsor from YouTube to TikTok as a potential changing

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,740
of the guard, while others noted a relative dearth of big-name YouTubers in attendance.

18
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,020
What everyone covering the event missed was perhaps the biggest change of all.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,920
Away from the conference floor itself, and tucked away upstairs and off-site, platforms,

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,640
companies, and agencies quietly competed for creators' attention in exclusive, backstage

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,880
lounges and parties set up by the likes of Meta, Jellysmack, YouTube, Carrot, and Snapchat.

22
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,680
In the three-year absence, the creator economy had grown into a matured, diversified, $100

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
billion business.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,280
But behind all the pomp and circumstance of the big events, the stiff competition between

25
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,300
the different platforms, and the wining and dining by agencies, companies, and brands

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,840
is of course the creator, their content, and their income.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,160
As an example, let's say there's a YouTube creator with 2 million subscribers who averages

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,840
1 million views per video.

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,520
How do they make money, and how much?

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,880
The well-known core of any YouTuber's income is AdSense—the system that serves the ads

31
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,760
before, during, and after videos.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,720
This hypothetical channel could expect to earn about $4,000 in AdSense revenue for their

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,560
million views, based on a typical revenue per meal rate, or RPM, of $4—meaning they

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,800
earn $4 per thousand views.

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,040
However, there is wild inconsistency on AdSense RPMs from creator to creator.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
The AdSense system's selling point for advertisers is its ability to target ads to

37
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,200
be served to audiences with particular geographies, demographics, or interests.

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,640
So, creator income all has to do with how valuable their audience is to advertisers.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,240
Advertisers only pay one-fifth the average to reach customers in Brazil, likely as Brazilian

40
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,540
spending power is lower, so if our hypothetical channel was produced in Portuguese, and therefore

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,320
had a big chunk of its audience in Brazil, it likely would earn a lower than average

42
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,320
RPM.

43
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,120
On those million views, the creator might only earn $1,200.

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Meanwhile, advertisers value audiences with particular interests quite highly.

45
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,900
Creators making videos about business or finance tend to have quite high RPMs, because there

46
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,860
are loads of investment platforms, banks, crypto companies, and others competing to

47
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,840
get those valuable advertising spots seen by an older, wealthier, financially savvy

48
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
audience.

49
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,060
If our creator made a US-based, English-language personal finance channel, they might earn

50
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,040
$8,000 in AdSense on those million views.

51
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,460
But for the sake of realism, let's assume the average—let's assume a $4 RPM, translating

52
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,680
to $4,000 in AdSense income.

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,800
But there's plenty of opportunity to dramatically grow the value of those million views.

54
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,720
Perhaps the most common is sponsorship—early into the development of the creator economy,

55
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,800
advertising agencies notice something.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,340
The most effective means of selling something off of the attention a creator's work attracts

57
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,440
is through the creator.

58
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,740
Using a 45-second externally produced AdSense ad before the video versus a 45-second sponsorship

59
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,120
voiced by the creator at the end, the latter overwhelmingly leads to more sign-ups.

60
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,800
With this recognition, the influencer marketing business was born.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,880
Influencer marketing is a little more complex than AdSense.

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,280
Typically, YouTube sponsorship is used by brands looking for sign-ups—it's conversion

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,780
marketing, not awareness marketing.

64
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,400
You wouldn't expect Coke, for example, to sponsor a YouTube video, because their marketing

65
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,720
focuses on assuring people think about Coke so they buy it when the opportunity arises,

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,300
rather than getting people to buy a Coke at that exact moment.

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,400
More often than not, the companies that do find YouTuber influencer marketing worthwhile

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,160
are either Online Subscription Services, Audible, CuriosityStream, Squarespace, BetterHelp,

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,840
or direct-to-consumer subscription brands—HelloFresh, Dollar Shave Club, Shaker, and Spoon.

70
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,960
With the subscription model boosting the lifetime value of an individual customer, Dollar Shave

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,200
Club can afford to spend more to get a given customer than Gillette, for example.

72
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Why this works for them is because of that link in the description.

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,560
Most sponsorships include a certain percent discount when users sign up through the creator's

74
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
dedicated link.

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,120
Not only does this drive increased performance, but it also assures that the hugely valuable

76
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,760
data tracking an individual spot's effectiveness stays accurate as it incentivizes users to

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,760
follow the dedicated link rather than the primary sign-up flow.

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,480
Almost every brand.com slash creator link operates as a tracking URL, capturing data

79
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,280
about how many people click through, how many people sign up, and even how long these

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,640
sign-ups stick around as customers.

81
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,680
These individualized data allow for a level of optimization far above what's possible

82
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,220
with TV, radio, or billboards, and provide a simple mechanism to monitor whether the

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,540
campaign is actually providing a return on investment.

84
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,620
But what these data have also illuminated is the huge degree of spread in the worth

85
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,720
of a view from creator to creator.

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,920
What influences this more than anything is the strength of the parasocial relationship.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,780
Parasocial relationships are a well-documented psychological phenomena where individuals

88
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,720
start to feel as if they have a genuine relationship with a personality that they have repeated

89
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,500
exposure to through media, even when they have never met or interacted with said personality.

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,380
People trust their friends, and so they also trust those that they have a parasocial relationship

91
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,380
with.

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,360
Therefore, the stronger the parasocial relationship, the more effective a given call to action

93
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
is.

94
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,620
YouTube creators can and do make certain content decisions to improve the parasocial relationship—being

95
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:02,120
on camera boosts it, so does injecting more personality into videos—speaking in a less-scripted

96
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,560
manner does too.

97
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,340
Even keeping visual quality relatively simple has proved successful in boosting the parasocial

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,320
relationship as it can help make videos feel like they're made by a person rather than

99
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,720
a company.

100
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,740
For creators, the process of figuring out what a given sponsorship is worth is complicated.

101
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,360
It all starts, of course, with the sponsor, but most companies' marketing divisions

102
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,840
are set up to write big checks to outside ad agencies that design and execute a given

103
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,840
campaign.

104
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,380
Even with individual YouTube sponsorships running well into the tens or even hundreds

105
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,220
of thousands of dollars, these companies are used to working in the millions, so they generally

106
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,540
contract a specialized influencer marketing agency like Semaphore, the OutLoud Group,

107
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:41,760
or Veritone One to divide up the check and run the campaign.

108
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,060
If a personal finance app is running a $2 million campaign with a $35 target cost per

109
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,100
acquisition, the agency's job is to properly price, book, and manage the individual spots

110
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,060
to drive 57,143 or more conversions into paying customers.

111
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,760
The performance variability for sponsorships is even greater than that of AdSense, but

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,520
with this sort of target CPA and this sort of product, creators often range between 500

113
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,600
and 5,000 views per conversion.

114
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,440
An agency might see that our hypothetical channel averages a million views and would

115
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,800
therefore likely drive about 400 conversions, so based on the $35 CPA, the creator probably

116
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,360
deserves about $14,000 for a sponsorship.

117
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,960
However, in practice, the creator only sees some of that.

118
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,940
Agencies can typically charge whatever commission they want—while taking 10 or 20% is common,

119
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,080
they could take 30 or 40% too as long as they can find creators willing to accept that offer.

120
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,700
In fact, they don't even need to disclose what commission they take—they could just

121
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,800
offer the number post-commission.

122
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,580
In practice, well-established major agencies have been found taking 50% commissions without

123
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:49,980
disclosure, meaning on that $14,000 spot, they'd keep $7,000.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,800
There's also not a strong market mechanism to assure that prices stay correlated to performance.

125
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,540
Most agencies and sponsors keep the data to themselves, so if a creator's sponsorship

126
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,220
performance improves, as it often does through time as the parasocial relationship deepens,

127
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,800
prices only adjust if the agency agrees to it, and only the agency typically knows if

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,140
the performance has truly improved enough to justify it.

129
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,340
Agencies will boost rates if they're worried the creator will turn down the offer, but

130
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,740
the power dynamic is undoubtedly weighted towards the agency's side and contractually,

131
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,620
they typically work for the brand, not the creator.

132
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,060
While larger creators have managers or agents who know how much their clients' sponsorship

133
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,180
slots are truly worth, younger or newer creators often have zero idea and have not yet established

134
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,740
a network of colleagues with whom they can gut-check rates.

135
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,620
They're therefore in a prime position to be taken advantage of at the exact moment

136
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,480
when they feel like their dreams are being fulfilled—$7,000 sounds amazing, until you

137
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,500
find out it started as $14,000.

138
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,560
Of course, YouTube isn't the only platform where creators are now making a living.

139
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,780
Twitch, Meta, TikTok, and Snap have each recognized that their platforms only go as far as the

140
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,440
creators they attract, and this recognition has effectively started a race for talent.

141
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,320
And again, this year's VidCon offers hints as to how this race is playing out.

142
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,040
The fact that a panel dedicated to demystifying the algorithm with Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast,

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,320
and Todd Bupri, YouTube's Director of Product Management, reached maximum venue capacity

144
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,860
speaks to the platform's continued pull.

145
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,040
As one attendee explained, while they had developed a TikTok profile with more than

146
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,800
half a million followers, they were at the panel because they wanted the stable income

147
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,560
that YouTube could provide.

148
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,240
TikTok might be taking off, but at this point, YouTube still holds an important advantage,

149
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,200
and it's one that's grounded in the platform's past.

150
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,200
By 2011, the year Snapchat was founded and Twitch was launched as the gaming offshoot

151
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,900
of Justin.tv, YouTube had surpassed three billion views a day and had begun experimenting

152
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,640
with monetizing channels beyond exclusive partners.

153
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,260
A year later, it opened the YouTube Partner Program to everyone, allowing all creators

154
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,500
an opportunity to make money off their products—a remarkably prescient recognition that the

155
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,000
platform only went as far as the creators populating it.

156
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,080
Then, in 2013, an ascended platform threatened to undercut YouTube the way Twitter had undercut

157
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,640
blogs—by promoting short form.

158
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,920
Vine's simple interface and its adherence to a strict six seconds cap on videos took

159
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,640
off, making it the fastest growing app in 2013 and home to 200 million monthly users

160
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
in 2015.

161
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,720
The only problem was that neither the platform nor its popular creators could make money.

162
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,800
Vine fostered talent and developed fame, but nobody could figure out how to build any sort

163
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,600
of monetizable rapport with an audience in only six seconds.

164
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,920
Instead, advertisers and creators pivoted to more expensive platforms like YouTube and

165
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,520
Within this early wave of potential YouTube competitors, it was only Twitch that figured

166
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,960
out how to successfully monetize the platform in a manner that attracted and retained talent.

167
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,680
With video game streaming personalities as Twitch's main draw, keeping talent on the

168
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,120
platform was of life-or-death importance to the site.

169
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,880
Along with the option to run ads on their streams, Twitch kept its creators by developing

170
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,520
a host of revenue-generating routes that included memberships, donations, affiliate links, and

171
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,400
direct paid subscriptions to their favorite channels.

172
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,280
This approach has turned the platform into one of the industry's most powerful as roughly

173
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,240
300,000 of the 2 million self-identified professional creators exist primarily on Twitch.

174
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,720
While YouTube and Twitch proved the commercial viability of long-form video and streaming,

175
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,280
recognizing the unmet potential of short-form has proved both alluring and elusive.

176
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,720
The very same year that Vine officially shut down, TikTok appeared in American app stores.

177
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,040
The rise of the Vine-like, easy-to-use, hyper-creative, hyper-consumable platform hasn't been anything

178
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,840
short of meteoric.

179
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:39,280
In Q1 of 2021, TikTok was downloaded 315 million times worldwide—the most of any app in a

180
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,840
quarter ever.

181
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,280
And yet, for the vast majority of TikTok creators without powerful brand partnerships, making

182
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,920
consistent money through their success on the app is difficult.

183
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,540
Paid music promotions from record labels, sponsored posts, and cash gifts direct from

184
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,800
audiences during livestreams offer little stability and limited growth potential.

185
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,840
To alleviate some of the monetization pains, TikTok introduced a $200 million dollar creator

186
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,800
fund in 2020, but because TikTok uses in-feed ads, it's difficult to attribute the success

187
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,260
of an advertisement to a given creator and thus, difficult to dole out payment in relation

188
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
to performance.

189
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,320
Additionally, with the fund having a hard cap, the more successful creators inhabit

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,840
the ecosystem, the fewer dollars there are to spread around.

191
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,800
As Hank Green pointed out, because of this static pool and the app's continued growth,

192
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,160
his TikToks, as of January of 2022, made about two and a half cents per thousand views—a

193
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,240
worryingly low number by itself, but one made increasingly troubling by the fact that he

194
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,440
used to make five cents per thousand views.

195
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,620
TikTokers are making money, but it's a dollar hard-earned, leaving the door ajar in the

196
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,360
race for their users' creative output.

197
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,880
In 2020, Meta launched Reels, Snap launched Spotlight, and YouTube launched YouTube Shorts—all

198
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,400
were new features that closely resembled TikTok.

199
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,540
In the year following its launch, Spotlight paid out over $250 million from its creator

200
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
fund.

201
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,920
In 2021, Meta announced plans to invest $1 billion in its Facebook and Instagram creators,

202
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,740
including a bonus program for Reels based on performance.

203
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,600
As of 2022, though, the future of short-form video is still very much up in the air.

204
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,540
What is certain is that creators today have more options than ever before, and thus, more

205
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,480
leverage than ever before.

206
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,520
With various platforms that cover various mediums at their disposal, financially successful

207
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,420
creators have gone from being thought of as multimedia aberrations in the 2010s to ever-critical

208
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,480
cogs in a growing industry where entertainment and advertisement so seamlessly overlap.

209
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,340
Creators of all sizes are spreading from one platform to multiple, and some are beginning

210
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,520
to move beyond platforms entirely.

211
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,960
Combining $4,000 in AdSense with $11,200 in sponsorship, our hypothetical creator currently

212
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:51,880
makes about 1.5 cents per view, but simultaneously, both the agency and Google are making about

213
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,960
0.3 cents on the same view, and then on top of that, the sponsors and advertisers are

214
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,440
making more on the profit the marketing generates.

215
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,520
While it's impossible to know the exact number, it's very possible that each of

216
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,680
these creators' views is generating three cents in economic value, and they're only

217
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,600
getting half of it.

218
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,280
While shared profits are a normal part of doing business, creators have recognized that

219
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,760
the more of those three cents they capture, the more they earn.

220
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,500
In practice, what this looks like is creators becoming their own sponsors.

221
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,860
It started with merch—channels would slap their logo on a shirt or hat or sticker and

222
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,860
sell it.

223
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,080
Some people bought these, but often just the most devoted fans.

224
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,760
Our creator that could get $11,200 in sponsorship would likely only earn one or two thousand

225
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,720
dollars from replacing that sponsor segment with a merch shoutout.

226
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,480
In response, creators adapted their merchandise more into clothing lines.

227
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,080
Logan Paul, for example, runs Maverick Clothing.

228
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,400
With clothing brands competing against other clothing brands, this operates more like a

229
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,460
business than merchandise, so creators often find this strategy far more effective and

230
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,940
sometimes competitive in performance versus an outside sponsor.

231
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,080
Logan Paul claimed his brand made between $30 and $40 million in its first year, while

232
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:03,780
our channel might expect to profit around the same $11,200 from promoting its clothing

233
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,560
brand as with an outside sponsor.

234
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,320
Taking this to the next level, the predominant trend of the past few years has been creators

235
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,920
launching fully-fledged businesses.

236
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,300
Mr. Beast started selling burgers cooked by Ghost Kitchens on food delivery apps under

237
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:20,040
the Mr. Beast Burger brand, which has since expanded to over 1,000 locations in the US,

238
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,880
Canada, UK, and UAE.

239
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,920
Mark Rober and Vsauce started subscription box companies called Crunchlabs and the Curiosity

240
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,280
Box, respectively.

241
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,640
Johnny Harris co-founded a travel course platform called Bright Trip.

242
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,920
The Nilk Boys launched their Happy Dad brand of hard seltzer.

243
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,640
Simone Geertz created the Everyday Goal Calendar.

244
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,920
Even Wendover Productions co-founded the Nebula Streaming Service, which operates as

245
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,360
an equity joint venture with the creators contributing to the platform—a fact that

246
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,640
is made clear in its ads for good reason—it works.

247
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,860
Across the board, what creators have found is that not only do they get to keep more

248
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,000
of those three cents per view, but also that a given viewer is more likely to convert into

249
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,560
a paying customer when the sponsorship is presented as promoting their own business

250
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,880
rather than the highest bidder.

251
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
That's to say, not only are creators getting more of the pie, they're also expanding

252
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
it.

253
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,880
The three cents per view might become four, and therefore it was an $11.2,000 sponsorship

254
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,420
on a million views might become $28,000.

255
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,240
With $32,000 in total income on that one hypothetical million view video, this hypothetical creator

256
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,100
has effectively earned 3.2 cents per view.

257
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,680
This is orders of magnitude more than they would have earned on the same view a decade

258
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,480
ago, and yet more orders of magnitude more than they would have earned from a view on

259
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,420
Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, or elsewhere.

260
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,480
This is how YouTube creators are now able to go full-time, making channels that previously

261
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,960
would have been but a hobby.

262
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,060
Newer creators tend to have less optimized channels, but even assuming 1.5 cents per

263
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,340
view, bi-weekly releases of videos achieving 150,000 average views would provide about

264
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,500
$4,000 in monthly income.

265
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,460
Simultaneously, it's these same figures that allow the absolute largest creators—Mr.

266
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,260
Beast, the Paul brothers, Markiplier, and others—to generate wealth rivaling that

267
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,180
made in the mainstream entertainment industry.

268
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,900
This is YouTube's competitive advantage.

269
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,540
YouTuber is now regularly ranked as one of kids' top dream jobs—up there with professional

270
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,100
athlete, firefighter, and veterinarian.

271
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,200
With a massive pinnacle to the dream and a relatively achievable entry point, creative

272
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,660
people will keep choosing YouTube as their platform of choice over TikTok, Instagram,

273
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,760
Twitter, or any other social site because as the other platforms are attempting to get

274
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,300
creators to work for less, YouTube, through the years, has successfully developed a platform

275
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,900
that earns creators more and more and more.

276
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,960
Of course, you know what's coming next.

277
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,900
This video, along with the payroll expenses, contractor bills, insurance payments, footage

278
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:44,140
licensing fees, office lease costs, administrative expenses, and every other unsexy cost that

279
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,860
goes into delivering you viewers what you've just seen, was truly, genuinely made possible

280
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,080
by our sponsor, Hover.

281
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,740
One of the reasons I love Hover is because they focus on one thing and just do it really

282
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,740
well.

283
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,060
Hover is the best place to buy domains for your website or email, and I know that they're

284
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,020
the best because I've bought dozens of domains for them over the years.

285
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,500
Recently, as I was sitting with my writers brainstorming a name for a new channel, I

286
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,100
had my laptop sitting in front of me with Hover open, searching which domain names were

287
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
available.

288
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,220
As soon as we settled on the name Jetlag The Game, I used Hover to buy jetlagthegame.com,

289
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,580
which took less than 30 seconds and cost a very reasonable $15.99 a year.

290
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,040
Through the years, any time I had a technical question or issue, their support picked up

291
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,660
immediately and figured out the solution right away.

292
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,420
Again, Hover is simple—they sell domains quickly, for a fair price, and help you with

293
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,660
managing it through the years, so if you have a name for a YouTube channel, business, organization,

294
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,900
or anything else and want to lock it down for a future website or custom email address,

295
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,480
you should buy the domain with Hover.

296
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,780
They also have over 400 domain extensions so you can get unique domains like our wendover.productions

297
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,780
one.

298
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,420
If that's not enough, by clicking the button on screen or heading to our link, hover.com

299
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,420
slash wendover, you'll get 10% off and as you now know so well, you'll be supporting

300
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,340
Wendover while you're at it.
