1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
In 2013, Jeff Bezos introduced the world to a concept that promised to revolutionize delivery.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,840
Bezos kept telling us that he did have a big surprise, something he wanted to unveil for

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,080
the first time.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,280
But there's no reason that they can't be used as delivery vehicles.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,880
Within a matter of years, autonomous drones would engulf cities, sweeping across skies,

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,840
delivering packages to front yards just 30 minutes after their order.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,880
The announcement floored Charlie Rose and America alike, grabbing headlines for weeks

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,640
and setting off fiery debates over just how disruptive the disruptive technology would

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,640
be.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,480
Drones would offer urban and suburban consumers a clean, quick, convenient delivery option

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,480
for food, medicine, or whatever else five pounds or less without burning fossil fuels,

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,560
without getting stuck in traffic, without making them wait.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,780
The idea was far-fetched, it was exciting, it was the future arriving in front of our

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:00,080
very eyes, and it signaled that the race to take delivery drones to market was on.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,280
By the time Amazon landed its first package, Zipline was already delivering medical supplies

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,420
in Rwanda, SkyDrop had flown a 7-Eleven Slurpee and a Domino's Pizza straight to consumers,

17
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,020
and Google's Project Wing had airdropped burritos to hungry college kids.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,140
A wave of startups sent their maiden drone delivery skyward to much media fanfare, while

19
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:24,020
major parcel couriers—DHL, UPS, FedEx—substantiated the hype by partnering with the budding tech

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,540
companies set to help solve their last-mile problems.

21
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,380
Inventors, investors, eccentric billionaires, and the world's biggest companies were all

22
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,180
pulling the same rope.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,900
Anything, anywhere, anytime.

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,240
The dark days of DoorDash and two-day delivery were over.

25
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,800
The drone delivery era was coming.

26
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Or so it seemed.

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,500
It's now 2022, and save for the smallest fraction of a percent of people, it's not

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,480
automated drones dropping off your small packages and food orders.

29
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,500
Pizzas aren't falling from the sky, they're showing up in the hands of a high schooler.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,300
Burritos aren't delicately dropped on your lawn from above, they're left on your doorstep

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,820
by a hustling gig worker.

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,340
Your Amazon order won't show up in 30 minutes, it probably won't even show up same day.

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,100
The world 60 Minutes introduced in 2013, the world that felt closer and closer to reality

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,380
with every inaugural delivery, just isn't here.

35
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,360
Fundamentally, the fast delivery niche still exists.

36
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,040
The last mile still accounts for around 40% of partial shipping costs, roads are still

37
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,540
increasingly clogged with traffic, green shipping alternatives are still desperately needed,

38
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,580
and consumers still want products as cheap and fast as possible.

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,840
Outside of a few specific locations, drone delivery has yet to take off, and in those

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,740
few specific locations, it's hardly more than a proof of concept.

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,280
Certainly, delays are understood, expected even, when it comes to the acceptance of a

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,060
disruptive technology.

43
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,900
Delayed acceptance, though, is at very most, only part of the story.

44
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,640
In 2021, Amazon fired staff and closed its prime-air offices in the UK.

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,500
From the former center of Amazon's drone project emerged stories of mismanagement and

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
disarray.

47
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,540
Employees drank beers at their desks, managers were given no direction, executives ignored

48
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,660
the stalling division aside from the occasional pizza party.

49
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,980
While the company responded to these reports with a statement affirming its continued investment

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,380
in drone delivery, Amazon hasn't released any promotional material for the project since

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,260
2016, and Prime Air's website doesn't seem to have been updated in years.

52
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,060
The most generous possible interpretation is that the Amazon project is definitively

53
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,140
on the backburner—others aren't even there.

54
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:41,580
While Amazon remains quiet on their future intentions, DHL announced in summer 2021 that

55
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,060
it was officially abandoning its Parcelcopter project nearly eight years after its maiden

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
flight.

57
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,340
So, two of the most important drone delivery companies put their programs on ice, few companies

58
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,960
are getting the investments they used to, and no company has yet realized the imminent

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:01,060
future of widespread operations laid out a decade ago.

60
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,220
So, what went so wrong with drone delivery?

61
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:12,620
Well, this is Phoenix—a sprawling desert metropolis home to five million people.

62
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,540
On first glance, Phoenix seems the perfect candidate for a drone delivery service.

63
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,420
Its year-round sunny, dry, still climate makes for easy, reliable flight conditions, its

64
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,740
autonomous innovation-friendly city and state governments would welcome them with open arms,

65
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,020
and its sprawling, low-density neighborhoods would make for countless hungry and impatient

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,500
residents lacking walkable dining and shopping options.

67
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,440
Surely, this is the low-hanging fruit—surely, a drone delivery company could come in, connect

68
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,860
any house with any product within minutes, and demand would immediately outstrip supply,

69
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
right?

70
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,900
Well, perhaps not.

71
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,700
Connecting any house with a drone delivery provider doesn't quite work, because in

72
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,240
the center of the city, right here, is Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

73
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,300
In order to assure the safety of arriving and departing aircraft at the busy hub, the

74
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,140
FAA restricts the use of drones within this area.

75
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,660
So, a Phoenix drone delivery service probably just couldn't operate here, and here, in

76
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,020
the restricted airspace around Luke Air Force Base, and here, around Phoenix Goodyear Airport,

77
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,580
and here, and here, and here, here, and here.

78
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,200
It's not entirely impossible to operate drones within restricted airspace, but from

79
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,740
a legal perspective, it ranges from somewhat to extremely difficult—enough that it probably

80
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,860
wouldn't be worth pursuing for a drone delivery company at least at the start.

81
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,940
The rest of Phoenix, though, is fair game.

82
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
To an extent.

83
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,460
You see, drones need somewhere to deliver to, and it's gotta be safe.

84
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:44,700
When the concept was first introduced, the vision typically presented was of a drone

85
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:50,540
flying down, landing on one's lawn, releasing its delivery, then taking off and flying away.

86
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,540
That didn't work.

87
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,500
At least, not in reality.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,300
Drone delivery is a novel technology, and, like any novel technology, the public views

89
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,260
it with an air of distrust.

90
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,520
The worst thing the industry could do is prove that distrust warranted with a series of high-profile

91
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,180
accidents at launch.

92
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,960
The first instance of a delivery drone injuring a customer will inevitably ignite a media

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,320
firestorm, which could lead to a legislative clampdown, so manufacturers naturally must

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,900
strive for perfection.

95
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,100
Perfection is tough to scale, though.

96
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,900
Delivery drones must act autonomously to be cost-effective, and autonomous operations

97
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,660
require computer vision and artificial intelligence able to reliably identify a clear landing

98
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
zone.

99
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,740
Determining whether someone is behind or in front of a window, noticing when a dog's

100
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,620
running towards the drone, knowing what's a pool and what's dry ground—these are

101
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,060
all challenging for a computer to tackle on its own, and so attaining perfection proves

102
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,540
rather difficult.

103
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Therefore, whereas the logistics field generally considers the last mile of delivery the most

104
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,440
difficult, once the economies of scale are gone, drone delivery is a last-mile solution

105
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,520
with its own last foot problem.

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,880
It's fairly straightforward to get a drone to a couple dozen feet above the ground—getting

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,880
a package safely to the ground has proven more challenging.

108
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,840
Some solutions have emerged.

109
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,620
Zipline, focusing on longer-distance delivery to a set number of facilities with dedicated

110
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,000
delivery zones, drops its payload in a packaging with an attached parachute that carries it

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,080
to the ground.

112
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,520
MatterNet also uses dedicated zones for delivering to commercial facilities, while they've

113
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,920
developed a system of delivery stations for use by urban consumers.

114
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,440
Uber Eats, meanwhile, implemented a scrappy yet inefficient system where delivery drones

115
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,680
would land on top of delivery drivers' cars, then those delivery drivers would walk the

116
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,640
food to the customer's door.

117
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,840
Most solutions for the last foot problem, however, have gravitated towards one method.

118
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,960
Wing, Skydrop, Flytrek's Wingcopter, and others have developed systems where their

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,940
drones hover above the destination at a safe height and lower their payloads to the ground

120
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:54,180
using cords—far less risky than landing a heavy drone propelled by fast-moving rotors.

121
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,620
What all these solutions have in common is that they require a roomy, controlled, obstruction-free

122
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,380
area to make their final deliveries.

123
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:07,020
However, in the places where people actually live, that's hardly a given.

124
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,980
Yards are the best delivery zones that are widespread, but not everyone has a yard.

125
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,220
While it's a safe bet for single-family homes in an area like Phoenix, it can be hit

126
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,580
or miss whether multifamily homes and apartment buildings have a big enough yard, and even

127
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,600
when they do, their communal nature means that the customer couldn't necessarily guarantee

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,140
that their landing area would be free from obstructions as would be the case with their

129
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,540
own private yard.

130
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,820
So, at least for an early drone delivery service, it probably wouldn't work in restricted

131
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,100
airspace, and probably not for anything beyond single-family homes either.

132
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,240
These, and other legal, technological, and practical constraints mean that the scope

133
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,400
of what works in terms of drone delivery is narrow.

134
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,280
It's pretty easy to start crossing off cities—Boston's winter is too harsh, New York's density inhibits

135
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,680
yards, DC's airspace is too restricted, Pittsburgh's landscape is too hilly, this

136
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
could go on and on.

137
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,980
While it varies by company, most delivery drones tend to be able to fly to deliveries

138
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,240
as far as about six miles away.

139
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,200
So, assuming early operations would base out of a single location to capture economies

140
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,920
of scale, meaning their drones would have to return to said location to charge after

141
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,600
each delivery, that means a viable first delivery zone in Phoenix, optimizing for a

142
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,600
large area free of airspace restrictions centered on wealthier neighborhoods, would be this—310,987

143
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,000
people live in this zone—a small chunk of the metro area's 5 million.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
However, in Phoenix, only 63.2% of housing units are single-family, which are likely

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,420
to have the private yard necessary for delivery, and only 92% are occupied, meaning, in this

146
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,380
prime zone, at least extrapolating using citywide data, which is the most precise available,

147
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,540
there are only 180,820 possible users of a drone delivery service.

148
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,420
This is clearly an imprecise methodology, but it's indicative of how the prospect

149
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:59,940
of drone delivery—the prospect of anything, anywhere, anytime—is getting diminished

150
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:05,540
and diminished and diminished down into a niche service for a lucky few.

151
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,620
A small system linking a strip mall to a neighborhood behind it, a fixed route flying COVID vaccines

152
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,220
from a distribution center to vaccination sites, six shops delivering to a small part

153
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,020
of a small town in Virginia—drone delivery has hardly moved beyond proof of concept,

154
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,860
and it's not even clear that they've proved the concept.

155
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,540
In 2016, when asked about same-day delivery, 70% of respondents said they were content

156
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:34,140
with the cheapest option, while just 23% of respondents said they'd pay more for same-day.

157
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,020
For drones to prove commercially viable, they need to decisively corner that quarter of

158
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,940
more willing customers, and to become ubiquitous, they'd likely need to operate at no extra

159
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,780
charge from ground delivery at all.

160
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:51,220
Most people, it turns out, are simply okay with waiting a day or two for their packages,

161
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,540
while all want them delivered as quickly and cheaply as possible.

162
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,100
When the drone delivery hype hit fewer pitch, one bit of nuance went overlooked.

163
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,300
Consumers simply don't care about how a package gets from B to C, so long as it's

164
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,140
quick, cost-efficient, and reliable.

165
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,820
They'd opt for a new technology once for the novelty, but by the 100th time, that wears

166
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,820
off.

167
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,020
Eventually, rationality will return.

168
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,560
In fact, when surveyed in 2020, consumers perceived drones to potentially threaten those

169
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,540
most important factors for them.

170
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,420
They said they were uncertain about drones' reliability, cost, and were worried about

171
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,500
the job loss they could incite.

172
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,440
Meanwhile, competitors have figured out a number of low-tech solutions that fulfill

173
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,980
these consumer desires—look no further than food delivery apps.

174
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:42,600
Since 2017, the very moment when drone delivery hype hit fever pitch, the food delivery industry

175
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,400
has tripled in size, ballooning into a $150 billion sector globally.

176
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,040
In this, speed matters and consumers expect to pay for the delivery cost—facts that

177
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,560
seemingly pave a lane for drone delivery.

178
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,560
But between Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash, the power players are already established,

179
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,480
and the competition is already fierce.

180
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,640
These comparatively low-tech companies don't even tell the consumer whether to expect their

181
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,320
burger to come by car, moped, bike, or foot—they just prioritize getting food to doors quickly,

182
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,320
pleasing the consumer regardless of method, and undercutting drone delivery in the process.

183
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,480
By and large, food delivery apps closely match the upside of drones within urban and suburban

184
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,640
areas without the hassle of complying with FAA guidelines and figuring out the last foot

185
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,680
problem.

186
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,240
Adding to the competitive problems facing drone startups, these companies and others

187
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,320
have since expanded into grocery, medicine, and goods deliveries.

188
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,940
Put simply, from the consumer perspective, the problem drone delivery was designed to

189
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:47,440
address has already been solved without building out a massively complicated aerial delivery

190
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
network.

191
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,260
The current low-tech gig economy model isn't perfect, though.

192
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,860
For consumers and restaurants alike, the usage fees are expensive, for those delivering the

193
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,280
pay is minimal, and for the big players, profit has proved elusive.

194
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,020
One partial solution is automation.

195
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,460
Here still, though, drones are likely to lose out.

196
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,000
Ground-based autonomous and semi-autonomous robotics have begun popping up in test markets

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,340
and partnering with the likes of Uber Eats and Grubhub to expand their reach.

198
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,840
While a recent partial ban on sidewalk wandering robots in San Francisco points to the hurdles

199
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,600
the technology faces, these hurdles just won't be as numerous as those facing drones.

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,460
Automation and technological advances may well help smooth out food and last-mile delivery.

201
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,760
In the near future, your prescription, your lunch order, or your afternoon coffee might

202
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,300
be showing up at your front door courtesy of an autonomous vehicle—you'll just need

203
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,840
to reach down and grab it from a robot instead of unclipping it from a drone above.

204
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,760
Now, many probably now look at drone delivery in retrospect and find it unsurprising that

205
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,460
the bombastic claims of the 2010s failed to pan out, but far fewer would have expressed

206
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,560
a dissenting opinion just five years ago.

207
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,880
That's because this is a rather classic story—that of a hype cycle.

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,240
A new idea comes around, a few early players start development, then something—a launch,

209
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,320
a demo, or even just a domino effect—sets off a media firestorm painting a rosy picture

210
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,160
of a future revolutionized by this new technology.

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,260
The story is so archetypal in tech that there's even a theoretical framework defining the

212
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,680
process—Gartner's hype cycle.

213
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,420
According to it, after that media firestorm, that peak of inflated expectations, results

214
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,220
slow and sentiment starts shifting downward.

215
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:37,200
Investors complain, and the public's memory fades, until the media begins coverage of

216
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,660
the purported failure.

217
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:44,600
The public grows disappointed, but then grows silent, and in the silence, first generations

218
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,060
are adapted into seconds, failures inform potential successes, and slowly, something

219
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,680
meaningful, albeit minor compared to the original vision, starts to work.

220
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
We are here.

221
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,900
While what's happening may be drowned out in the media by what's not, there are applications

222
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,640
that are starting to work.

223
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,560
Three years ago, Zipline was a small Silicon Valley startup operating a few dozen drone

224
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,880
delivery flights per day in one region of Rwanda.

225
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,060
They relied on the principle that many medical products are crucially important when used,

226
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,060
but not used regularly, and often have short shelf lives, making them tough to economically

227
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,500
and efficiently stock at smaller clinic operations.

228
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,620
In less developed regions, poor road infrastructure makes many remote clinics many hours or days

229
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:34,280
away from a distribution center, despite relative proximity as the crow flies.

230
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:39,680
Therefore, Zipline's drones acted as a quick, low-cost distribution system for necessary

231
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,980
medical products to remote areas, dotting Rwanda's rolling hills.

232
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,000
Far more places than Rwanda's southern province fit this description.

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,100
Nowadays, Zipline operates similar systems in the country's eastern province, four

234
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,400
regions in Ghana, the US, and a number of other locations are in active development.

235
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:03,500
Excitingly, the news of Zipline's impending expansion to the Ivory Coast hardly made news.

236
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,520
It wasn't written about in Wired, TechCrunch didn't publish an article about it, just

237
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,440
a simple press release and some industry and regional coverage.

238
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,360
This is progress.

239
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,740
This shows that Zipline's deployments aren't proofs of concepts, aren't publicity stunts—they're

240
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,100
actual, real, commercial implementations.

241
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,740
Crucially, Zipline didn't find a use case that drones could fulfill, they found a use

242
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,720
case that only drones could fulfill.

243
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,500
They found the healthcare use case, they found the low-hanging fruit, and other companies

244
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,740
are noticing.

245
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:42,200
Maternet and Wingcopter are now placing heavy emphasis on their medical potential as well.

246
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,560
As the early use case matures, cost will come down, acceptance will rise, and innovators

247
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,600
will find more uses that only the novel technology can fulfill.

248
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,160
Once one becomes clear, more must be possible.

249
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,680
Eventually, everything will creep closer to that idealistic vision first presented at

250
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,560
the peak of the hype and then, just slightly delayed behind expectations, the new technology

251
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,400
will finally have actually changed the world.

252
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,300
Unlike delivery drones, what I hope does live up to expectations is our brand new feature-length

253
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,620
documentary which came out today after almost a year of work.

254
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,340
It's called The Colorado Problem—A River in the Red, and rather than trying to describe

255
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,400
it, you're about to become one of the first people to see its trailer, but before, I need

256
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,500
to very quickly remind you that if you're not already a subscriber to CuriosityStream

257
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,640
or Nebula, the two sites where you can watch this doc, you can subscribe to them both for

258
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,020
less than $15 a year at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover—lower than the monthly fee

259
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,260
for that big, red streaming site that just jacked up its price.

260
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:48,740
It's these exact subscriptions that enable us to do these big, ambitious documentary

261
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,600
projects, so a massive thank you to those of you already subscribed.

262
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,720
But now to the point, the trailer.

263
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,420
Things are worse than we're actually able to describe them right now because we just

264
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,120
don't have the language or the measurements to do that.

265
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,980
The water is essential.

266
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,820
Everything you see green out here is because of Colorado River water.

267
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,180
This would be a dry, desolate desert without this water.

268
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,740
The easy solutions are gone.

269
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,540
Their solution is our problem.

270
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,840
The stakes are high to get this right.

271
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:26,520
There is a plan B, and it's really ugly.

272
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,860
As a reminder, to watch this doc, click the button on screen or head to CuriosityStream.com

273
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,080
slash Wendover, and you'll get access to both CuriosityStream and Nebula for less than

274
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,720
$15 a year.
