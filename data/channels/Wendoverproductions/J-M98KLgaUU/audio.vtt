00:00.000 --> 00:07.480
In 2013, Jeff Bezos introduced the world to a concept that promised to revolutionize delivery.

00:07.480 --> 00:12.840
Bezos kept telling us that he did have a big surprise, something he wanted to unveil for

00:12.840 --> 00:14.080
the first time.

00:14.080 --> 00:17.280
But there's no reason that they can't be used as delivery vehicles.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.880
Within a matter of years, autonomous drones would engulf cities, sweeping across skies,

00:22.880 --> 00:26.840
delivering packages to front yards just 30 minutes after their order.

00:26.880 --> 00:31.880
The announcement floored Charlie Rose and America alike, grabbing headlines for weeks

00:31.880 --> 00:36.640
and setting off fiery debates over just how disruptive the disruptive technology would

00:36.640 --> 00:37.640
be.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.480
Drones would offer urban and suburban consumers a clean, quick, convenient delivery option

00:42.480 --> 00:47.480
for food, medicine, or whatever else five pounds or less without burning fossil fuels,

00:47.480 --> 00:50.560
without getting stuck in traffic, without making them wait.

00:50.560 --> 00:54.780
The idea was far-fetched, it was exciting, it was the future arriving in front of our

00:54.780 --> 01:00.080
very eyes, and it signaled that the race to take delivery drones to market was on.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.280
By the time Amazon landed its first package, Zipline was already delivering medical supplies

01:04.280 --> 01:09.420
in Rwanda, SkyDrop had flown a 7-Eleven Slurpee and a Domino's Pizza straight to consumers,

01:09.420 --> 01:13.020
and Google's Project Wing had airdropped burritos to hungry college kids.

01:13.020 --> 01:18.140
A wave of startups sent their maiden drone delivery skyward to much media fanfare, while

01:18.140 --> 01:24.020
major parcel couriers—DHL, UPS, FedEx—substantiated the hype by partnering with the budding tech

01:24.020 --> 01:27.540
companies set to help solve their last-mile problems.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.380
Inventors, investors, eccentric billionaires, and the world's biggest companies were all

01:32.380 --> 01:34.180
pulling the same rope.

01:34.180 --> 01:36.900
Anything, anywhere, anytime.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.240
The dark days of DoorDash and two-day delivery were over.

01:40.240 --> 01:43.800
The drone delivery era was coming.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
Or so it seemed.

01:44.800 --> 01:50.500
It's now 2022, and save for the smallest fraction of a percent of people, it's not

01:50.500 --> 01:54.480
automated drones dropping off your small packages and food orders.

01:54.480 --> 01:58.500
Pizzas aren't falling from the sky, they're showing up in the hands of a high schooler.

01:58.500 --> 02:02.300
Burritos aren't delicately dropped on your lawn from above, they're left on your doorstep

02:02.300 --> 02:03.820
by a hustling gig worker.

02:03.820 --> 02:08.340
Your Amazon order won't show up in 30 minutes, it probably won't even show up same day.

02:08.340 --> 02:14.100
The world 60 Minutes introduced in 2013, the world that felt closer and closer to reality

02:14.100 --> 02:18.380
with every inaugural delivery, just isn't here.

02:18.380 --> 02:22.360
Fundamentally, the fast delivery niche still exists.

02:22.360 --> 02:27.040
The last mile still accounts for around 40% of partial shipping costs, roads are still

02:27.040 --> 02:31.540
increasingly clogged with traffic, green shipping alternatives are still desperately needed,

02:31.540 --> 02:35.580
and consumers still want products as cheap and fast as possible.

02:35.580 --> 02:39.840
Outside of a few specific locations, drone delivery has yet to take off, and in those

02:39.840 --> 02:43.740
few specific locations, it's hardly more than a proof of concept.

02:43.740 --> 02:48.280
Certainly, delays are understood, expected even, when it comes to the acceptance of a

02:48.280 --> 02:50.060
disruptive technology.

02:50.060 --> 02:54.900
Delayed acceptance, though, is at very most, only part of the story.

02:54.900 --> 03:00.640
In 2021, Amazon fired staff and closed its prime-air offices in the UK.

03:00.640 --> 03:05.500
From the former center of Amazon's drone project emerged stories of mismanagement and

03:05.500 --> 03:06.500
disarray.

03:06.500 --> 03:11.540
Employees drank beers at their desks, managers were given no direction, executives ignored

03:11.540 --> 03:14.660
the stalling division aside from the occasional pizza party.

03:14.660 --> 03:18.980
While the company responded to these reports with a statement affirming its continued investment

03:18.980 --> 03:23.380
in drone delivery, Amazon hasn't released any promotional material for the project since

03:23.380 --> 03:28.260
2016, and Prime Air's website doesn't seem to have been updated in years.

03:28.260 --> 03:33.060
The most generous possible interpretation is that the Amazon project is definitively

03:33.060 --> 03:36.140
on the backburner—others aren't even there.

03:36.460 --> 03:41.580
While Amazon remains quiet on their future intentions, DHL announced in summer 2021 that

03:41.580 --> 03:47.060
it was officially abandoning its Parcelcopter project nearly eight years after its maiden

03:47.060 --> 03:48.060
flight.

03:48.060 --> 03:52.340
So, two of the most important drone delivery companies put their programs on ice, few companies

03:52.340 --> 03:56.960
are getting the investments they used to, and no company has yet realized the imminent

03:56.960 --> 04:01.060
future of widespread operations laid out a decade ago.

04:01.060 --> 04:05.220
So, what went so wrong with drone delivery?

04:06.580 --> 04:12.620
Well, this is Phoenix—a sprawling desert metropolis home to five million people.

04:12.620 --> 04:17.540
On first glance, Phoenix seems the perfect candidate for a drone delivery service.

04:17.540 --> 04:22.420
Its year-round sunny, dry, still climate makes for easy, reliable flight conditions, its

04:22.420 --> 04:26.740
autonomous innovation-friendly city and state governments would welcome them with open arms,

04:26.740 --> 04:31.020
and its sprawling, low-density neighborhoods would make for countless hungry and impatient

04:31.020 --> 04:34.500
residents lacking walkable dining and shopping options.

04:34.500 --> 04:40.440
Surely, this is the low-hanging fruit—surely, a drone delivery company could come in, connect

04:40.440 --> 04:45.860
any house with any product within minutes, and demand would immediately outstrip supply,

04:45.860 --> 04:46.860
right?

04:46.860 --> 04:48.900
Well, perhaps not.

04:48.900 --> 04:52.700
Connecting any house with a drone delivery provider doesn't quite work, because in

04:52.700 --> 04:57.240
the center of the city, right here, is Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

04:57.240 --> 05:01.300
In order to assure the safety of arriving and departing aircraft at the busy hub, the

05:01.300 --> 05:04.140
FAA restricts the use of drones within this area.

05:04.180 --> 05:09.660
So, a Phoenix drone delivery service probably just couldn't operate here, and here, in

05:09.660 --> 05:15.020
the restricted airspace around Luke Air Force Base, and here, around Phoenix Goodyear Airport,

05:15.020 --> 05:18.580
and here, and here, and here, here, and here.

05:18.580 --> 05:23.200
It's not entirely impossible to operate drones within restricted airspace, but from

05:23.200 --> 05:28.740
a legal perspective, it ranges from somewhat to extremely difficult—enough that it probably

05:28.740 --> 05:32.860
wouldn't be worth pursuing for a drone delivery company at least at the start.

05:32.860 --> 05:35.940
The rest of Phoenix, though, is fair game.

05:35.940 --> 05:36.940
To an extent.

05:36.940 --> 05:40.460
You see, drones need somewhere to deliver to, and it's gotta be safe.

05:40.460 --> 05:44.700
When the concept was first introduced, the vision typically presented was of a drone

05:44.700 --> 05:50.540
flying down, landing on one's lawn, releasing its delivery, then taking off and flying away.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.540
That didn't work.

05:51.540 --> 05:53.500
At least, not in reality.

05:53.500 --> 05:58.300
Drone delivery is a novel technology, and, like any novel technology, the public views

05:58.300 --> 06:00.260
it with an air of distrust.

06:00.260 --> 06:05.520
The worst thing the industry could do is prove that distrust warranted with a series of high-profile

06:05.520 --> 06:07.180
accidents at launch.

06:07.180 --> 06:11.960
The first instance of a delivery drone injuring a customer will inevitably ignite a media

06:11.960 --> 06:17.320
firestorm, which could lead to a legislative clampdown, so manufacturers naturally must

06:17.320 --> 06:19.900
strive for perfection.

06:19.900 --> 06:22.100
Perfection is tough to scale, though.

06:22.100 --> 06:25.900
Delivery drones must act autonomously to be cost-effective, and autonomous operations

06:25.900 --> 06:30.660
require computer vision and artificial intelligence able to reliably identify a clear landing

06:30.660 --> 06:31.660
zone.

06:31.660 --> 06:35.740
Determining whether someone is behind or in front of a window, noticing when a dog's

06:35.740 --> 06:39.620
running towards the drone, knowing what's a pool and what's dry ground—these are

06:39.620 --> 06:44.060
all challenging for a computer to tackle on its own, and so attaining perfection proves

06:44.060 --> 06:45.540
rather difficult.

06:45.540 --> 06:50.540
Therefore, whereas the logistics field generally considers the last mile of delivery the most

06:50.540 --> 06:55.440
difficult, once the economies of scale are gone, drone delivery is a last-mile solution

06:55.480 --> 06:57.520
with its own last foot problem.

06:57.520 --> 07:01.880
It's fairly straightforward to get a drone to a couple dozen feet above the ground—getting

07:01.880 --> 07:05.880
a package safely to the ground has proven more challenging.

07:05.880 --> 07:07.840
Some solutions have emerged.

07:07.840 --> 07:12.620
Zipline, focusing on longer-distance delivery to a set number of facilities with dedicated

07:12.620 --> 07:17.000
delivery zones, drops its payload in a packaging with an attached parachute that carries it

07:17.000 --> 07:18.080
to the ground.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.520
MatterNet also uses dedicated zones for delivering to commercial facilities, while they've

07:22.520 --> 07:25.920
developed a system of delivery stations for use by urban consumers.

07:25.920 --> 07:30.440
Uber Eats, meanwhile, implemented a scrappy yet inefficient system where delivery drones

07:30.440 --> 07:34.680
would land on top of delivery drivers' cars, then those delivery drivers would walk the

07:34.680 --> 07:36.640
food to the customer's door.

07:36.640 --> 07:40.840
Most solutions for the last foot problem, however, have gravitated towards one method.

07:40.840 --> 07:44.960
Wing, Skydrop, Flytrek's Wingcopter, and others have developed systems where their

07:44.960 --> 07:48.940
drones hover above the destination at a safe height and lower their payloads to the ground

07:48.940 --> 07:54.180
using cords—far less risky than landing a heavy drone propelled by fast-moving rotors.

07:54.180 --> 07:59.620
What all these solutions have in common is that they require a roomy, controlled, obstruction-free

07:59.620 --> 08:02.380
area to make their final deliveries.

08:02.380 --> 08:07.020
However, in the places where people actually live, that's hardly a given.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.980
Yards are the best delivery zones that are widespread, but not everyone has a yard.

08:10.980 --> 08:15.220
While it's a safe bet for single-family homes in an area like Phoenix, it can be hit

08:15.220 --> 08:19.580
or miss whether multifamily homes and apartment buildings have a big enough yard, and even

08:19.580 --> 08:23.600
when they do, their communal nature means that the customer couldn't necessarily guarantee

08:23.600 --> 08:27.140
that their landing area would be free from obstructions as would be the case with their

08:27.140 --> 08:28.540
own private yard.

08:28.540 --> 08:32.820
So, at least for an early drone delivery service, it probably wouldn't work in restricted

08:32.820 --> 08:37.100
airspace, and probably not for anything beyond single-family homes either.

08:37.100 --> 08:42.240
These, and other legal, technological, and practical constraints mean that the scope

08:42.240 --> 08:45.400
of what works in terms of drone delivery is narrow.

08:45.400 --> 08:51.280
It's pretty easy to start crossing off cities—Boston's winter is too harsh, New York's density inhibits

08:51.280 --> 08:55.680
yards, DC's airspace is too restricted, Pittsburgh's landscape is too hilly, this

08:55.680 --> 08:57.120
could go on and on.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.980
While it varies by company, most delivery drones tend to be able to fly to deliveries

09:00.980 --> 09:03.240
as far as about six miles away.

09:03.240 --> 09:07.200
So, assuming early operations would base out of a single location to capture economies

09:07.200 --> 09:10.920
of scale, meaning their drones would have to return to said location to charge after

09:10.920 --> 09:15.600
each delivery, that means a viable first delivery zone in Phoenix, optimizing for a

09:15.600 --> 09:23.600
large area free of airspace restrictions centered on wealthier neighborhoods, would be this—310,987

09:23.600 --> 09:28.000
people live in this zone—a small chunk of the metro area's 5 million.

09:28.000 --> 09:33.000
However, in Phoenix, only 63.2% of housing units are single-family, which are likely

09:33.000 --> 09:38.420
to have the private yard necessary for delivery, and only 92% are occupied, meaning, in this

09:38.420 --> 09:43.380
prime zone, at least extrapolating using citywide data, which is the most precise available,

09:43.380 --> 09:49.540
there are only 180,820 possible users of a drone delivery service.

09:49.540 --> 09:54.420
This is clearly an imprecise methodology, but it's indicative of how the prospect

09:54.420 --> 09:59.940
of drone delivery—the prospect of anything, anywhere, anytime—is getting diminished

09:59.940 --> 10:05.540
and diminished and diminished down into a niche service for a lucky few.

10:05.660 --> 10:10.620
A small system linking a strip mall to a neighborhood behind it, a fixed route flying COVID vaccines

10:10.620 --> 10:15.220
from a distribution center to vaccination sites, six shops delivering to a small part

10:15.220 --> 10:20.020
of a small town in Virginia—drone delivery has hardly moved beyond proof of concept,

10:20.020 --> 10:22.860
and it's not even clear that they've proved the concept.

10:22.860 --> 10:28.540
In 2016, when asked about same-day delivery, 70% of respondents said they were content

10:28.540 --> 10:34.140
with the cheapest option, while just 23% of respondents said they'd pay more for same-day.

10:34.140 --> 10:39.020
For drones to prove commercially viable, they need to decisively corner that quarter of

10:39.020 --> 10:43.940
more willing customers, and to become ubiquitous, they'd likely need to operate at no extra

10:43.940 --> 10:46.780
charge from ground delivery at all.

10:46.780 --> 10:51.220
Most people, it turns out, are simply okay with waiting a day or two for their packages,

10:51.220 --> 10:55.540
while all want them delivered as quickly and cheaply as possible.

10:55.540 --> 11:01.100
When the drone delivery hype hit fewer pitch, one bit of nuance went overlooked.

11:01.100 --> 11:06.300
Consumers simply don't care about how a package gets from B to C, so long as it's

11:06.300 --> 11:08.140
quick, cost-efficient, and reliable.

11:08.140 --> 11:12.820
They'd opt for a new technology once for the novelty, but by the 100th time, that wears

11:12.820 --> 11:13.820
off.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.020
Eventually, rationality will return.

11:16.020 --> 11:20.560
In fact, when surveyed in 2020, consumers perceived drones to potentially threaten those

11:20.560 --> 11:22.540
most important factors for them.

11:22.540 --> 11:26.420
They said they were uncertain about drones' reliability, cost, and were worried about

11:26.420 --> 11:28.500
the job loss they could incite.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.440
Meanwhile, competitors have figured out a number of low-tech solutions that fulfill

11:32.440 --> 11:36.980
these consumer desires—look no further than food delivery apps.

11:36.980 --> 11:42.600
Since 2017, the very moment when drone delivery hype hit fever pitch, the food delivery industry

11:42.600 --> 11:48.400
has tripled in size, ballooning into a $150 billion sector globally.

11:48.400 --> 11:53.040
In this, speed matters and consumers expect to pay for the delivery cost—facts that

11:53.040 --> 11:55.560
seemingly pave a lane for drone delivery.

11:55.560 --> 12:00.560
But between Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash, the power players are already established,

12:00.560 --> 12:03.480
and the competition is already fierce.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.640
These comparatively low-tech companies don't even tell the consumer whether to expect their

12:07.640 --> 12:13.320
burger to come by car, moped, bike, or foot—they just prioritize getting food to doors quickly,

12:13.320 --> 12:18.320
pleasing the consumer regardless of method, and undercutting drone delivery in the process.

12:18.320 --> 12:23.480
By and large, food delivery apps closely match the upside of drones within urban and suburban

12:23.480 --> 12:28.640
areas without the hassle of complying with FAA guidelines and figuring out the last foot

12:28.640 --> 12:29.680
problem.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.240
Adding to the competitive problems facing drone startups, these companies and others

12:33.240 --> 12:37.320
have since expanded into grocery, medicine, and goods deliveries.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.940
Put simply, from the consumer perspective, the problem drone delivery was designed to

12:41.940 --> 12:47.440
address has already been solved without building out a massively complicated aerial delivery

12:47.440 --> 12:48.440
network.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.260
The current low-tech gig economy model isn't perfect, though.

12:52.260 --> 12:56.860
For consumers and restaurants alike, the usage fees are expensive, for those delivering the

12:56.860 --> 13:01.280
pay is minimal, and for the big players, profit has proved elusive.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.020
One partial solution is automation.

13:04.020 --> 13:07.460
Here still, though, drones are likely to lose out.

13:07.460 --> 13:12.000
Ground-based autonomous and semi-autonomous robotics have begun popping up in test markets

13:12.000 --> 13:15.340
and partnering with the likes of Uber Eats and Grubhub to expand their reach.

13:15.340 --> 13:19.840
While a recent partial ban on sidewalk wandering robots in San Francisco points to the hurdles

13:19.840 --> 13:25.600
the technology faces, these hurdles just won't be as numerous as those facing drones.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.460
Automation and technological advances may well help smooth out food and last-mile delivery.

13:30.460 --> 13:34.760
In the near future, your prescription, your lunch order, or your afternoon coffee might

13:34.760 --> 13:38.300
be showing up at your front door courtesy of an autonomous vehicle—you'll just need

13:38.300 --> 13:42.840
to reach down and grab it from a robot instead of unclipping it from a drone above.

13:42.840 --> 13:47.760
Now, many probably now look at drone delivery in retrospect and find it unsurprising that

13:47.760 --> 13:52.460
the bombastic claims of the 2010s failed to pan out, but far fewer would have expressed

13:52.460 --> 13:55.560
a dissenting opinion just five years ago.

13:55.560 --> 14:00.880
That's because this is a rather classic story—that of a hype cycle.

14:00.880 --> 14:06.240
A new idea comes around, a few early players start development, then something—a launch,

14:06.240 --> 14:12.320
a demo, or even just a domino effect—sets off a media firestorm painting a rosy picture

14:12.320 --> 14:16.160
of a future revolutionized by this new technology.

14:16.160 --> 14:21.260
The story is so archetypal in tech that there's even a theoretical framework defining the

14:21.260 --> 14:23.680
process—Gartner's hype cycle.

14:23.680 --> 14:29.420
According to it, after that media firestorm, that peak of inflated expectations, results

14:29.420 --> 14:33.220
slow and sentiment starts shifting downward.

14:33.220 --> 14:37.200
Investors complain, and the public's memory fades, until the media begins coverage of

14:37.200 --> 14:38.660
the purported failure.

14:38.660 --> 14:44.600
The public grows disappointed, but then grows silent, and in the silence, first generations

14:44.600 --> 14:50.060
are adapted into seconds, failures inform potential successes, and slowly, something

14:50.060 --> 14:55.680
meaningful, albeit minor compared to the original vision, starts to work.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.680
We are here.

14:56.680 --> 15:01.900
While what's happening may be drowned out in the media by what's not, there are applications

15:01.900 --> 15:03.640
that are starting to work.

15:03.640 --> 15:08.560
Three years ago, Zipline was a small Silicon Valley startup operating a few dozen drone

15:08.560 --> 15:11.880
delivery flights per day in one region of Rwanda.

15:11.880 --> 15:16.060
They relied on the principle that many medical products are crucially important when used,

15:16.060 --> 15:21.060
but not used regularly, and often have short shelf lives, making them tough to economically

15:21.060 --> 15:24.500
and efficiently stock at smaller clinic operations.

15:24.500 --> 15:29.620
In less developed regions, poor road infrastructure makes many remote clinics many hours or days

15:29.620 --> 15:34.280
away from a distribution center, despite relative proximity as the crow flies.

15:34.280 --> 15:39.680
Therefore, Zipline's drones acted as a quick, low-cost distribution system for necessary

15:39.680 --> 15:43.980
medical products to remote areas, dotting Rwanda's rolling hills.

15:43.980 --> 15:48.000
Far more places than Rwanda's southern province fit this description.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.100
Nowadays, Zipline operates similar systems in the country's eastern province, four

15:52.100 --> 15:57.400
regions in Ghana, the US, and a number of other locations are in active development.

15:57.400 --> 16:03.500
Excitingly, the news of Zipline's impending expansion to the Ivory Coast hardly made news.

16:03.500 --> 16:07.520
It wasn't written about in Wired, TechCrunch didn't publish an article about it, just

16:07.520 --> 16:11.440
a simple press release and some industry and regional coverage.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.360
This is progress.

16:13.360 --> 16:18.740
This shows that Zipline's deployments aren't proofs of concepts, aren't publicity stunts—they're

16:18.740 --> 16:22.100
actual, real, commercial implementations.

16:22.100 --> 16:26.740
Crucially, Zipline didn't find a use case that drones could fulfill, they found a use

16:26.740 --> 16:29.720
case that only drones could fulfill.

16:29.720 --> 16:35.500
They found the healthcare use case, they found the low-hanging fruit, and other companies

16:35.500 --> 16:36.740
are noticing.

16:36.760 --> 16:42.200
Maternet and Wingcopter are now placing heavy emphasis on their medical potential as well.

16:42.200 --> 16:47.560
As the early use case matures, cost will come down, acceptance will rise, and innovators

16:47.560 --> 16:51.600
will find more uses that only the novel technology can fulfill.

16:51.600 --> 16:55.160
Once one becomes clear, more must be possible.

16:55.160 --> 16:59.680
Eventually, everything will creep closer to that idealistic vision first presented at

16:59.680 --> 17:04.560
the peak of the hype and then, just slightly delayed behind expectations, the new technology

17:04.560 --> 17:09.400
will finally have actually changed the world.

17:09.400 --> 17:14.300
Unlike delivery drones, what I hope does live up to expectations is our brand new feature-length

17:14.300 --> 17:18.620
documentary which came out today after almost a year of work.

17:18.620 --> 17:23.340
It's called The Colorado Problem—A River in the Red, and rather than trying to describe

17:23.340 --> 17:27.400
it, you're about to become one of the first people to see its trailer, but before, I need

17:27.400 --> 17:31.500
to very quickly remind you that if you're not already a subscriber to CuriosityStream

17:31.500 --> 17:35.640
or Nebula, the two sites where you can watch this doc, you can subscribe to them both for

17:35.640 --> 17:41.020
less than $15 a year at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover—lower than the monthly fee

17:41.020 --> 17:44.260
for that big, red streaming site that just jacked up its price.

17:44.260 --> 17:48.740
It's these exact subscriptions that enable us to do these big, ambitious documentary

17:48.740 --> 17:52.600
projects, so a massive thank you to those of you already subscribed.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.720
But now to the point, the trailer.

17:56.720 --> 18:00.420
Things are worse than we're actually able to describe them right now because we just

18:00.420 --> 18:03.120
don't have the language or the measurements to do that.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.980
The water is essential.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.820
Everything you see green out here is because of Colorado River water.

18:07.820 --> 18:11.180
This would be a dry, desolate desert without this water.

18:11.180 --> 18:12.740
The easy solutions are gone.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.540
Their solution is our problem.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.840
The stakes are high to get this right.

18:16.840 --> 18:26.520
There is a plan B, and it's really ugly.

18:26.520 --> 18:30.860
As a reminder, to watch this doc, click the button on screen or head to CuriosityStream.com

18:30.860 --> 18:35.080
slash Wendover, and you'll get access to both CuriosityStream and Nebula for less than

18:35.080 --> 18:36.720
$15 a year.
