0	7480	In 2013, Jeff Bezos introduced the world to a concept that promised to revolutionize delivery.
7480	12840	Bezos kept telling us that he did have a big surprise, something he wanted to unveil for
12840	14080	the first time.
14080	17280	But there's no reason that they can't be used as delivery vehicles.
17280	22880	Within a matter of years, autonomous drones would engulf cities, sweeping across skies,
22880	26840	delivering packages to front yards just 30 minutes after their order.
26880	31880	The announcement floored Charlie Rose and America alike, grabbing headlines for weeks
31880	36640	and setting off fiery debates over just how disruptive the disruptive technology would
36640	37640	be.
37640	42480	Drones would offer urban and suburban consumers a clean, quick, convenient delivery option
42480	47480	for food, medicine, or whatever else five pounds or less without burning fossil fuels,
47480	50560	without getting stuck in traffic, without making them wait.
50560	54780	The idea was far-fetched, it was exciting, it was the future arriving in front of our
54780	60080	very eyes, and it signaled that the race to take delivery drones to market was on.
60080	64280	By the time Amazon landed its first package, Zipline was already delivering medical supplies
64280	69420	in Rwanda, SkyDrop had flown a 7-Eleven Slurpee and a Domino's Pizza straight to consumers,
69420	73020	and Google's Project Wing had airdropped burritos to hungry college kids.
73020	78140	A wave of startups sent their maiden drone delivery skyward to much media fanfare, while
78140	84020	major parcel couriers—DHL, UPS, FedEx—substantiated the hype by partnering with the budding tech
84020	87540	companies set to help solve their last-mile problems.
87540	92380	Inventors, investors, eccentric billionaires, and the world's biggest companies were all
92380	94180	pulling the same rope.
94180	96900	Anything, anywhere, anytime.
96900	100240	The dark days of DoorDash and two-day delivery were over.
100240	103800	The drone delivery era was coming.
103800	104800	Or so it seemed.
104800	110500	It's now 2022, and save for the smallest fraction of a percent of people, it's not
110500	114480	automated drones dropping off your small packages and food orders.
114480	118500	Pizzas aren't falling from the sky, they're showing up in the hands of a high schooler.
118500	122300	Burritos aren't delicately dropped on your lawn from above, they're left on your doorstep
122300	123820	by a hustling gig worker.
123820	128340	Your Amazon order won't show up in 30 minutes, it probably won't even show up same day.
128340	134100	The world 60 Minutes introduced in 2013, the world that felt closer and closer to reality
134100	138380	with every inaugural delivery, just isn't here.
138380	142360	Fundamentally, the fast delivery niche still exists.
142360	147040	The last mile still accounts for around 40% of partial shipping costs, roads are still
147040	151540	increasingly clogged with traffic, green shipping alternatives are still desperately needed,
151540	155580	and consumers still want products as cheap and fast as possible.
155580	159840	Outside of a few specific locations, drone delivery has yet to take off, and in those
159840	163740	few specific locations, it's hardly more than a proof of concept.
163740	168280	Certainly, delays are understood, expected even, when it comes to the acceptance of a
168280	170060	disruptive technology.
170060	174900	Delayed acceptance, though, is at very most, only part of the story.
174900	180640	In 2021, Amazon fired staff and closed its prime-air offices in the UK.
180640	185500	From the former center of Amazon's drone project emerged stories of mismanagement and
185500	186500	disarray.
186500	191540	Employees drank beers at their desks, managers were given no direction, executives ignored
191540	194660	the stalling division aside from the occasional pizza party.
194660	198980	While the company responded to these reports with a statement affirming its continued investment
198980	203380	in drone delivery, Amazon hasn't released any promotional material for the project since
203380	208260	2016, and Prime Air's website doesn't seem to have been updated in years.
208260	213060	The most generous possible interpretation is that the Amazon project is definitively
213060	216140	on the backburner—others aren't even there.
216460	221580	While Amazon remains quiet on their future intentions, DHL announced in summer 2021 that
221580	227060	it was officially abandoning its Parcelcopter project nearly eight years after its maiden
227060	228060	flight.
228060	232340	So, two of the most important drone delivery companies put their programs on ice, few companies
232340	236960	are getting the investments they used to, and no company has yet realized the imminent
236960	241060	future of widespread operations laid out a decade ago.
241060	245220	So, what went so wrong with drone delivery?
246580	252620	Well, this is Phoenix—a sprawling desert metropolis home to five million people.
252620	257540	On first glance, Phoenix seems the perfect candidate for a drone delivery service.
257540	262420	Its year-round sunny, dry, still climate makes for easy, reliable flight conditions, its
262420	266740	autonomous innovation-friendly city and state governments would welcome them with open arms,
266740	271020	and its sprawling, low-density neighborhoods would make for countless hungry and impatient
271020	274500	residents lacking walkable dining and shopping options.
274500	280440	Surely, this is the low-hanging fruit—surely, a drone delivery company could come in, connect
280440	285860	any house with any product within minutes, and demand would immediately outstrip supply,
285860	286860	right?
286860	288900	Well, perhaps not.
288900	292700	Connecting any house with a drone delivery provider doesn't quite work, because in
292700	297240	the center of the city, right here, is Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.
297240	301300	In order to assure the safety of arriving and departing aircraft at the busy hub, the
301300	304140	FAA restricts the use of drones within this area.
304180	309660	So, a Phoenix drone delivery service probably just couldn't operate here, and here, in
309660	315020	the restricted airspace around Luke Air Force Base, and here, around Phoenix Goodyear Airport,
315020	318580	and here, and here, and here, here, and here.
318580	323200	It's not entirely impossible to operate drones within restricted airspace, but from
323200	328740	a legal perspective, it ranges from somewhat to extremely difficult—enough that it probably
328740	332860	wouldn't be worth pursuing for a drone delivery company at least at the start.
332860	335940	The rest of Phoenix, though, is fair game.
335940	336940	To an extent.
336940	340460	You see, drones need somewhere to deliver to, and it's gotta be safe.
340460	344700	When the concept was first introduced, the vision typically presented was of a drone
344700	350540	flying down, landing on one's lawn, releasing its delivery, then taking off and flying away.
350540	351540	That didn't work.
351540	353500	At least, not in reality.
353500	358300	Drone delivery is a novel technology, and, like any novel technology, the public views
358300	360260	it with an air of distrust.
360260	365520	The worst thing the industry could do is prove that distrust warranted with a series of high-profile
365520	367180	accidents at launch.
367180	371960	The first instance of a delivery drone injuring a customer will inevitably ignite a media
371960	377320	firestorm, which could lead to a legislative clampdown, so manufacturers naturally must
377320	379900	strive for perfection.
379900	382100	Perfection is tough to scale, though.
382100	385900	Delivery drones must act autonomously to be cost-effective, and autonomous operations
385900	390660	require computer vision and artificial intelligence able to reliably identify a clear landing
390660	391660	zone.
391660	395740	Determining whether someone is behind or in front of a window, noticing when a dog's
395740	399620	running towards the drone, knowing what's a pool and what's dry ground—these are
399620	404060	all challenging for a computer to tackle on its own, and so attaining perfection proves
404060	405540	rather difficult.
405540	410540	Therefore, whereas the logistics field generally considers the last mile of delivery the most
410540	415440	difficult, once the economies of scale are gone, drone delivery is a last-mile solution
415480	417520	with its own last foot problem.
417520	421880	It's fairly straightforward to get a drone to a couple dozen feet above the ground—getting
421880	425880	a package safely to the ground has proven more challenging.
425880	427840	Some solutions have emerged.
427840	432620	Zipline, focusing on longer-distance delivery to a set number of facilities with dedicated
432620	437000	delivery zones, drops its payload in a packaging with an attached parachute that carries it
437000	438080	to the ground.
438080	442520	MatterNet also uses dedicated zones for delivering to commercial facilities, while they've
442520	445920	developed a system of delivery stations for use by urban consumers.
445920	450440	Uber Eats, meanwhile, implemented a scrappy yet inefficient system where delivery drones
450440	454680	would land on top of delivery drivers' cars, then those delivery drivers would walk the
454680	456640	food to the customer's door.
456640	460840	Most solutions for the last foot problem, however, have gravitated towards one method.
460840	464960	Wing, Skydrop, Flytrek's Wingcopter, and others have developed systems where their
464960	468940	drones hover above the destination at a safe height and lower their payloads to the ground
468940	474180	using cords—far less risky than landing a heavy drone propelled by fast-moving rotors.
474180	479620	What all these solutions have in common is that they require a roomy, controlled, obstruction-free
479620	482380	area to make their final deliveries.
482380	487020	However, in the places where people actually live, that's hardly a given.
487020	490980	Yards are the best delivery zones that are widespread, but not everyone has a yard.
490980	495220	While it's a safe bet for single-family homes in an area like Phoenix, it can be hit
495220	499580	or miss whether multifamily homes and apartment buildings have a big enough yard, and even
499580	503600	when they do, their communal nature means that the customer couldn't necessarily guarantee
503600	507140	that their landing area would be free from obstructions as would be the case with their
507140	508540	own private yard.
508540	512820	So, at least for an early drone delivery service, it probably wouldn't work in restricted
512820	517100	airspace, and probably not for anything beyond single-family homes either.
517100	522240	These, and other legal, technological, and practical constraints mean that the scope
522240	525400	of what works in terms of drone delivery is narrow.
525400	531280	It's pretty easy to start crossing off cities—Boston's winter is too harsh, New York's density inhibits
531280	535680	yards, DC's airspace is too restricted, Pittsburgh's landscape is too hilly, this
535680	537120	could go on and on.
537120	540980	While it varies by company, most delivery drones tend to be able to fly to deliveries
540980	543240	as far as about six miles away.
543240	547200	So, assuming early operations would base out of a single location to capture economies
547200	550920	of scale, meaning their drones would have to return to said location to charge after
550920	555600	each delivery, that means a viable first delivery zone in Phoenix, optimizing for a
555600	563600	large area free of airspace restrictions centered on wealthier neighborhoods, would be this—310,987
563600	568000	people live in this zone—a small chunk of the metro area's 5 million.
568000	573000	However, in Phoenix, only 63.2% of housing units are single-family, which are likely
573000	578420	to have the private yard necessary for delivery, and only 92% are occupied, meaning, in this
578420	583380	prime zone, at least extrapolating using citywide data, which is the most precise available,
583380	589540	there are only 180,820 possible users of a drone delivery service.
589540	594420	This is clearly an imprecise methodology, but it's indicative of how the prospect
594420	599940	of drone delivery—the prospect of anything, anywhere, anytime—is getting diminished
599940	605540	and diminished and diminished down into a niche service for a lucky few.
605660	610620	A small system linking a strip mall to a neighborhood behind it, a fixed route flying COVID vaccines
610620	615220	from a distribution center to vaccination sites, six shops delivering to a small part
615220	620020	of a small town in Virginia—drone delivery has hardly moved beyond proof of concept,
620020	622860	and it's not even clear that they've proved the concept.
622860	628540	In 2016, when asked about same-day delivery, 70% of respondents said they were content
628540	634140	with the cheapest option, while just 23% of respondents said they'd pay more for same-day.
634140	639020	For drones to prove commercially viable, they need to decisively corner that quarter of
639020	643940	more willing customers, and to become ubiquitous, they'd likely need to operate at no extra
643940	646780	charge from ground delivery at all.
646780	651220	Most people, it turns out, are simply okay with waiting a day or two for their packages,
651220	655540	while all want them delivered as quickly and cheaply as possible.
655540	661100	When the drone delivery hype hit fewer pitch, one bit of nuance went overlooked.
661100	666300	Consumers simply don't care about how a package gets from B to C, so long as it's
666300	668140	quick, cost-efficient, and reliable.
668140	672820	They'd opt for a new technology once for the novelty, but by the 100th time, that wears
672820	673820	off.
673820	676020	Eventually, rationality will return.
676020	680560	In fact, when surveyed in 2020, consumers perceived drones to potentially threaten those
680560	682540	most important factors for them.
682540	686420	They said they were uncertain about drones' reliability, cost, and were worried about
686420	688500	the job loss they could incite.
688500	692440	Meanwhile, competitors have figured out a number of low-tech solutions that fulfill
692440	696980	these consumer desires—look no further than food delivery apps.
696980	702600	Since 2017, the very moment when drone delivery hype hit fever pitch, the food delivery industry
702600	708400	has tripled in size, ballooning into a $150 billion sector globally.
708400	713040	In this, speed matters and consumers expect to pay for the delivery cost—facts that
713040	715560	seemingly pave a lane for drone delivery.
715560	720560	But between Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash, the power players are already established,
720560	723480	and the competition is already fierce.
723480	727640	These comparatively low-tech companies don't even tell the consumer whether to expect their
727640	733320	burger to come by car, moped, bike, or foot—they just prioritize getting food to doors quickly,
733320	738320	pleasing the consumer regardless of method, and undercutting drone delivery in the process.
738320	743480	By and large, food delivery apps closely match the upside of drones within urban and suburban
743480	748640	areas without the hassle of complying with FAA guidelines and figuring out the last foot
748640	749680	problem.
749680	753240	Adding to the competitive problems facing drone startups, these companies and others
753240	757320	have since expanded into grocery, medicine, and goods deliveries.
757320	761940	Put simply, from the consumer perspective, the problem drone delivery was designed to
761940	767440	address has already been solved without building out a massively complicated aerial delivery
767440	768440	network.
768440	772260	The current low-tech gig economy model isn't perfect, though.
772260	776860	For consumers and restaurants alike, the usage fees are expensive, for those delivering the
776860	781280	pay is minimal, and for the big players, profit has proved elusive.
781280	784020	One partial solution is automation.
784020	787460	Here still, though, drones are likely to lose out.
787460	792000	Ground-based autonomous and semi-autonomous robotics have begun popping up in test markets
792000	795340	and partnering with the likes of Uber Eats and Grubhub to expand their reach.
795340	799840	While a recent partial ban on sidewalk wandering robots in San Francisco points to the hurdles
799840	805600	the technology faces, these hurdles just won't be as numerous as those facing drones.
805600	810460	Automation and technological advances may well help smooth out food and last-mile delivery.
810460	814760	In the near future, your prescription, your lunch order, or your afternoon coffee might
814760	818300	be showing up at your front door courtesy of an autonomous vehicle—you'll just need
818300	822840	to reach down and grab it from a robot instead of unclipping it from a drone above.
822840	827760	Now, many probably now look at drone delivery in retrospect and find it unsurprising that
827760	832460	the bombastic claims of the 2010s failed to pan out, but far fewer would have expressed
832460	835560	a dissenting opinion just five years ago.
835560	840880	That's because this is a rather classic story—that of a hype cycle.
840880	846240	A new idea comes around, a few early players start development, then something—a launch,
846240	852320	a demo, or even just a domino effect—sets off a media firestorm painting a rosy picture
852320	856160	of a future revolutionized by this new technology.
856160	861260	The story is so archetypal in tech that there's even a theoretical framework defining the
861260	863680	process—Gartner's hype cycle.
863680	869420	According to it, after that media firestorm, that peak of inflated expectations, results
869420	873220	slow and sentiment starts shifting downward.
873220	877200	Investors complain, and the public's memory fades, until the media begins coverage of
877200	878660	the purported failure.
878660	884600	The public grows disappointed, but then grows silent, and in the silence, first generations
884600	890060	are adapted into seconds, failures inform potential successes, and slowly, something
890060	895680	meaningful, albeit minor compared to the original vision, starts to work.
895680	896680	We are here.
896680	901900	While what's happening may be drowned out in the media by what's not, there are applications
901900	903640	that are starting to work.
903640	908560	Three years ago, Zipline was a small Silicon Valley startup operating a few dozen drone
908560	911880	delivery flights per day in one region of Rwanda.
911880	916060	They relied on the principle that many medical products are crucially important when used,
916060	921060	but not used regularly, and often have short shelf lives, making them tough to economically
921060	924500	and efficiently stock at smaller clinic operations.
924500	929620	In less developed regions, poor road infrastructure makes many remote clinics many hours or days
929620	934280	away from a distribution center, despite relative proximity as the crow flies.
934280	939680	Therefore, Zipline's drones acted as a quick, low-cost distribution system for necessary
939680	943980	medical products to remote areas, dotting Rwanda's rolling hills.
943980	948000	Far more places than Rwanda's southern province fit this description.
948000	952100	Nowadays, Zipline operates similar systems in the country's eastern province, four
952100	957400	regions in Ghana, the US, and a number of other locations are in active development.
957400	963500	Excitingly, the news of Zipline's impending expansion to the Ivory Coast hardly made news.
963500	967520	It wasn't written about in Wired, TechCrunch didn't publish an article about it, just
967520	971440	a simple press release and some industry and regional coverage.
971440	973360	This is progress.
973360	978740	This shows that Zipline's deployments aren't proofs of concepts, aren't publicity stunts—they're
978740	982100	actual, real, commercial implementations.
982100	986740	Crucially, Zipline didn't find a use case that drones could fulfill, they found a use
986740	989720	case that only drones could fulfill.
989720	995500	They found the healthcare use case, they found the low-hanging fruit, and other companies
995500	996740	are noticing.
996760	1002200	Maternet and Wingcopter are now placing heavy emphasis on their medical potential as well.
1002200	1007560	As the early use case matures, cost will come down, acceptance will rise, and innovators
1007560	1011600	will find more uses that only the novel technology can fulfill.
1011600	1015160	Once one becomes clear, more must be possible.
1015160	1019680	Eventually, everything will creep closer to that idealistic vision first presented at
1019680	1024560	the peak of the hype and then, just slightly delayed behind expectations, the new technology
1024560	1029400	will finally have actually changed the world.
1029400	1034300	Unlike delivery drones, what I hope does live up to expectations is our brand new feature-length
1034300	1038620	documentary which came out today after almost a year of work.
1038620	1043340	It's called The Colorado Problem—A River in the Red, and rather than trying to describe
1043340	1047400	it, you're about to become one of the first people to see its trailer, but before, I need
1047400	1051500	to very quickly remind you that if you're not already a subscriber to CuriosityStream
1051500	1055640	or Nebula, the two sites where you can watch this doc, you can subscribe to them both for
1055640	1061020	less than $15 a year at CuriosityStream.com slash Wendover—lower than the monthly fee
