0	4180	Before the 16th century, clocks were horrible.
4180	8300	Typically there was one large mechanical clock in the center of any town which would be reset
8300	13000	daily, but by the end of the day, these would be off by as much as 20 minutes.
13000	17060	Time was but a rough estimate, but nobody really had a problem with it since there was
17060	19600	no expectation of accuracy.
19600	23800	At the time, there was no real need for accurate clocks in daily life.
23800	27720	The need for more accurate clocks came about when explorers started to voyage across the
27720	29580	world by sea.
29580	33740	The best way for ships to calculate their locations was to have two clocks, one with
33740	38740	the time of the ship's origin and one with the current time, as calculated by a sundial.
38740	42700	With every four minutes of difference between the two times, you would know that you had
42700	46600	travelled about 68 miles, or one degree of longitude.
46600	50760	The problem with this method was with the accuracy of the clocks.
50760	54700	Much like the clocks in town centers, the origin clocks were off by up to 20 minutes
54700	59700	by the end of one day, so this method was useless after a few days of travel.
59700	64720	This stifled exploration, so governments around the world offered prizes equivalent to millions
64720	67900	of dollars to anyone who could design an accurate clock.
67900	71100	That's where Galileo comes into play.
71100	76100	Legend has it that in 1583, a 19 year old Galileo was bored while attending prayers
76100	80360	at the Duomo of Pisa so he started watching the hanging lamps up above.
80360	85140	He noticed that, as they swung back and forth, the lamps always took the exact same amount
85140	87620	of time to complete one swing.
87620	92220	No matter if they swung one foot or one inch, the swing would always take the exact same
92220	93620	amount of time.
93620	98840	58 years later, this property was used to make a pendulum clock.
98840	103120	Properly weighted, a pendulum could be designed to swing once per second and the clocks would
103120	105980	use the swinging weight to keep time.
105980	108020	This clock was amazingly accurate.
108040	112120	A week after being set, it would only be off by as much as a minute.
112120	117080	One hundred years after its invention, the pendulum clock was in every house.
117080	120720	Many argue that, without this invention, the industrial revolution would not have been
120720	122060	possible.
122060	126020	You could now tell someone to meet you at an exact time and they would actually be there
126020	127800	at that time.
127800	131880	Ships could now use these accurate clocks for accurate navigation and this meant that
131880	137520	it was no longer risky to send ships regularly to buy and sell goods across the world.
137540	140860	But time also changed the way people worked.
140860	144500	Before the pendulum clock, people only worked for results.
144500	148420	By the end of the day, they were paid for how much they made instead of how much they
148420	149420	worked.
149420	154260	With the clock, workers worked for an amount of time and they were paid by the hour.
154260	159460	With the new production boom, manufacturers demanded a method of fast and cheap shipping
159460	163900	and so the railroad was born, but this introduced a new problem.
163900	166720	Time was still dictated by the sun.
166720	170740	Each town would calculate the local time based upon the location of the sun in the
170740	175860	sky, but this meant that from one town to the next, the time would be different.
175860	180720	In one town it could be 810 and in the next town over, it would be 815.
180720	184660	Both times were correct for the two locations, so this didn't really cause any problems
184660	188140	since it would take hours to get to that next town over.
188140	192180	Across the United States, there were thousands of different local times.
192200	196720	However, with the newly invented railroad, people could get from one town to the next
196720	202040	quickly, but nobody knew when trains really left since everyone used a different time.
202040	206540	The railroad might use one time, while the origin town would use another, and the destination
206540	208920	town would use a completely different one.
208920	213200	Britain solved this problem by creating a standardized time, Greenwich Mean Time, and
213200	216880	transmitting that time across the country by telegraph.
216880	222000	The US decided that, with its huge size, a standard time zone would not work, so four
222020	224800	different time zones were mapped out.
224800	229820	Much like Britain, the standard time would be transmitted across the country by telegraph.
229820	233720	The implementation of this new time zone, however, created one of the stranger days
233720	235540	in human history.
235540	240060	The new eastern time zone ran four minutes behind the time that New York had been using,
240060	245820	so on Sunday, November 18, 1883, the clock struck noon, then four minutes later, the
245820	250220	clock struck noon again as the new time standard was implemented.
250220	255240	The next great innovation in timekeeping came towards the beginning of the 20th century.
255240	259840	Pierre and Jacques Curie, two French physicists, noticed that when electricity was applied
259840	263720	to quartz, it vibrates at an incredibly stable rate.
263720	270020	Knowing that quartz vibrates 32,768 times a second, clockmakers used this crystal to
270020	273140	make incredibly accurate clocks.
273140	278120	These quartz clocks were able to go a month only losing or gaining 15 seconds.
278120	282380	Just as the pendulum clock allowed for the industrial revolution, the quartz clock allowed
282380	285020	for the technological revolution.
285020	289220	Without quartz clocks, modern computers would have been impossible.
289220	294480	An accurate internal clock is needed to coordinate all the different microprocessors.
294480	298740	With these new accurate clocks, however, people also began to notice that earth's rotation
298740	300820	wasn't all that regular.
300820	304260	It deviated by a few seconds here and there.
304260	309880	In the 1950s, the first super-accurate atomic clocks were built, measuring time based upon
309880	314240	the decay of atomic elements, and this allowed an international conference of weight and
314240	318600	measures to change what time was in 1967.
318600	322020	They decided that a day was no longer one rotation of the earth.
322020	326280	A day was now 86,400 atomic seconds.
326280	332320	Since the time it takes for earth to rotate is not exactly 86,400 atomic seconds, we make
332320	336740	up for this by having leap days and leap seconds every once in a while.
336740	341540	The atomic clock also allowed for nanosecond accuracy, and this is actually pretty important
341540	345220	for many modern technologies, most notably the GPS.
345220	352220	GPS works by asking three different satellites the time based upon their onboard atomic clocks.
352220	356700	When the answer comes back, each time will be slightly different on a nanosecond level
356700	361060	due to the satellites being at different distances and the request for the time going at only
361060	362060	the speed of light.
362060	367260	So the GPS, knowing the location of the satellites based upon their extremely predictable orbits,
367260	369660	can figure out where it is.
369660	371880	So that's how time developed.
371880	376700	Hopefully you can now see how the human conception of time was essential for the development
376700	383920	of our modern world and can still be called one of humanity's greatest inventions.
383920	391060	Today we're going to talk about space law.
391060	395480	So back in ye old days, property owners had the rights to their land going up forever
395480	397780	and ever in perpetuity.
397780	401360	But then the airplane came around and smart people realized that you couldn't just go
401360	405400	around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace.
