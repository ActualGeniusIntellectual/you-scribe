1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Before the 16th century, clocks were horrible.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,300
Typically there was one large mechanical clock in the center of any town which would be reset

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,000
daily, but by the end of the day, these would be off by as much as 20 minutes.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,060
Time was but a rough estimate, but nobody really had a problem with it since there was

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,600
no expectation of accuracy.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,800
At the time, there was no real need for accurate clocks in daily life.

7
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,720
The need for more accurate clocks came about when explorers started to voyage across the

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,580
world by sea.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,740
The best way for ships to calculate their locations was to have two clocks, one with

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,740
the time of the ship's origin and one with the current time, as calculated by a sundial.

11
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,700
With every four minutes of difference between the two times, you would know that you had

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,600
travelled about 68 miles, or one degree of longitude.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,760
The problem with this method was with the accuracy of the clocks.

14
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,700
Much like the clocks in town centers, the origin clocks were off by up to 20 minutes

15
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,700
by the end of one day, so this method was useless after a few days of travel.

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,720
This stifled exploration, so governments around the world offered prizes equivalent to millions

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,900
of dollars to anyone who could design an accurate clock.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:11,100
That's where Galileo comes into play.

19
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,100
Legend has it that in 1583, a 19 year old Galileo was bored while attending prayers

20
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,360
at the Duomo of Pisa so he started watching the hanging lamps up above.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,140
He noticed that, as they swung back and forth, the lamps always took the exact same amount

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,620
of time to complete one swing.

23
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,220
No matter if they swung one foot or one inch, the swing would always take the exact same

24
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,620
amount of time.

25
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,840
58 years later, this property was used to make a pendulum clock.

26
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,120
Properly weighted, a pendulum could be designed to swing once per second and the clocks would

27
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,980
use the swinging weight to keep time.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,020
This clock was amazingly accurate.

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,120
A week after being set, it would only be off by as much as a minute.

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:57,080
One hundred years after its invention, the pendulum clock was in every house.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,720
Many argue that, without this invention, the industrial revolution would not have been

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,060
possible.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,020
You could now tell someone to meet you at an exact time and they would actually be there

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,800
at that time.

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,880
Ships could now use these accurate clocks for accurate navigation and this meant that

36
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:17,520
it was no longer risky to send ships regularly to buy and sell goods across the world.

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,860
But time also changed the way people worked.

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,500
Before the pendulum clock, people only worked for results.

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,420
By the end of the day, they were paid for how much they made instead of how much they

40
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
worked.

41
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,260
With the clock, workers worked for an amount of time and they were paid by the hour.

42
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,460
With the new production boom, manufacturers demanded a method of fast and cheap shipping

43
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,900
and so the railroad was born, but this introduced a new problem.

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,720
Time was still dictated by the sun.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,740
Each town would calculate the local time based upon the location of the sun in the

46
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,860
sky, but this meant that from one town to the next, the time would be different.

47
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,720
In one town it could be 810 and in the next town over, it would be 815.

48
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,660
Both times were correct for the two locations, so this didn't really cause any problems

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,140
since it would take hours to get to that next town over.

50
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,180
Across the United States, there were thousands of different local times.

51
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,720
However, with the newly invented railroad, people could get from one town to the next

52
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,040
quickly, but nobody knew when trains really left since everyone used a different time.

53
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,540
The railroad might use one time, while the origin town would use another, and the destination

54
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,920
town would use a completely different one.

55
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,200
Britain solved this problem by creating a standardized time, Greenwich Mean Time, and

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,880
transmitting that time across the country by telegraph.

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,000
The US decided that, with its huge size, a standard time zone would not work, so four

58
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,800
different time zones were mapped out.

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,820
Much like Britain, the standard time would be transmitted across the country by telegraph.

60
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,720
The implementation of this new time zone, however, created one of the stranger days

61
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,540
in human history.

62
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,060
The new eastern time zone ran four minutes behind the time that New York had been using,

63
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,820
so on Sunday, November 18, 1883, the clock struck noon, then four minutes later, the

64
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,220
clock struck noon again as the new time standard was implemented.

65
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,240
The next great innovation in timekeeping came towards the beginning of the 20th century.

66
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,840
Pierre and Jacques Curie, two French physicists, noticed that when electricity was applied

67
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,720
to quartz, it vibrates at an incredibly stable rate.

68
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,020
Knowing that quartz vibrates 32,768 times a second, clockmakers used this crystal to

69
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,140
make incredibly accurate clocks.

70
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:38,120
These quartz clocks were able to go a month only losing or gaining 15 seconds.

71
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,380
Just as the pendulum clock allowed for the industrial revolution, the quartz clock allowed

72
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,020
for the technological revolution.

73
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,220
Without quartz clocks, modern computers would have been impossible.

74
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,480
An accurate internal clock is needed to coordinate all the different microprocessors.

75
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,740
With these new accurate clocks, however, people also began to notice that earth's rotation

76
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,820
wasn't all that regular.

77
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,260
It deviated by a few seconds here and there.

78
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,880
In the 1950s, the first super-accurate atomic clocks were built, measuring time based upon

79
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,240
the decay of atomic elements, and this allowed an international conference of weight and

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,600
measures to change what time was in 1967.

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,020
They decided that a day was no longer one rotation of the earth.

82
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,280
A day was now 86,400 atomic seconds.

83
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,320
Since the time it takes for earth to rotate is not exactly 86,400 atomic seconds, we make

84
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,740
up for this by having leap days and leap seconds every once in a while.

85
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,540
The atomic clock also allowed for nanosecond accuracy, and this is actually pretty important

86
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,220
for many modern technologies, most notably the GPS.

87
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:52,220
GPS works by asking three different satellites the time based upon their onboard atomic clocks.

88
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,700
When the answer comes back, each time will be slightly different on a nanosecond level

89
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,060
due to the satellites being at different distances and the request for the time going at only

90
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
the speed of light.

91
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,260
So the GPS, knowing the location of the satellites based upon their extremely predictable orbits,

92
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,660
can figure out where it is.

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,880
So that's how time developed.

94
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,700
Hopefully you can now see how the human conception of time was essential for the development

95
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:23,920
of our modern world and can still be called one of humanity's greatest inventions.

96
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:31,060
Today we're going to talk about space law.

97
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,480
So back in ye old days, property owners had the rights to their land going up forever

98
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,780
and ever in perpetuity.

99
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,360
But then the airplane came around and smart people realized that you couldn't just go

100
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,400
around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace.
