00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
Before the 16th century, clocks were horrible.

00:04.180 --> 00:08.300
Typically there was one large mechanical clock in the center of any town which would be reset

00:08.300 --> 00:13.000
daily, but by the end of the day, these would be off by as much as 20 minutes.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.060
Time was but a rough estimate, but nobody really had a problem with it since there was

00:17.060 --> 00:19.600
no expectation of accuracy.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.800
At the time, there was no real need for accurate clocks in daily life.

00:23.800 --> 00:27.720
The need for more accurate clocks came about when explorers started to voyage across the

00:27.720 --> 00:29.580
world by sea.

00:29.580 --> 00:33.740
The best way for ships to calculate their locations was to have two clocks, one with

00:33.740 --> 00:38.740
the time of the ship's origin and one with the current time, as calculated by a sundial.

00:38.740 --> 00:42.700
With every four minutes of difference between the two times, you would know that you had

00:42.700 --> 00:46.600
travelled about 68 miles, or one degree of longitude.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.760
The problem with this method was with the accuracy of the clocks.

00:50.760 --> 00:54.700
Much like the clocks in town centers, the origin clocks were off by up to 20 minutes

00:54.700 --> 00:59.700
by the end of one day, so this method was useless after a few days of travel.

00:59.700 --> 01:04.720
This stifled exploration, so governments around the world offered prizes equivalent to millions

01:04.720 --> 01:07.900
of dollars to anyone who could design an accurate clock.

01:07.900 --> 01:11.100
That's where Galileo comes into play.

01:11.100 --> 01:16.100
Legend has it that in 1583, a 19 year old Galileo was bored while attending prayers

01:16.100 --> 01:20.360
at the Duomo of Pisa so he started watching the hanging lamps up above.

01:20.360 --> 01:25.140
He noticed that, as they swung back and forth, the lamps always took the exact same amount

01:25.140 --> 01:27.620
of time to complete one swing.

01:27.620 --> 01:32.220
No matter if they swung one foot or one inch, the swing would always take the exact same

01:32.220 --> 01:33.620
amount of time.

01:33.620 --> 01:38.840
58 years later, this property was used to make a pendulum clock.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.120
Properly weighted, a pendulum could be designed to swing once per second and the clocks would

01:43.120 --> 01:45.980
use the swinging weight to keep time.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.020
This clock was amazingly accurate.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.120
A week after being set, it would only be off by as much as a minute.

01:52.120 --> 01:57.080
One hundred years after its invention, the pendulum clock was in every house.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.720
Many argue that, without this invention, the industrial revolution would not have been

02:00.720 --> 02:02.060
possible.

02:02.060 --> 02:06.020
You could now tell someone to meet you at an exact time and they would actually be there

02:06.020 --> 02:07.800
at that time.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.880
Ships could now use these accurate clocks for accurate navigation and this meant that

02:11.880 --> 02:17.520
it was no longer risky to send ships regularly to buy and sell goods across the world.

02:17.540 --> 02:20.860
But time also changed the way people worked.

02:20.860 --> 02:24.500
Before the pendulum clock, people only worked for results.

02:24.500 --> 02:28.420
By the end of the day, they were paid for how much they made instead of how much they

02:28.420 --> 02:29.420
worked.

02:29.420 --> 02:34.260
With the clock, workers worked for an amount of time and they were paid by the hour.

02:34.260 --> 02:39.460
With the new production boom, manufacturers demanded a method of fast and cheap shipping

02:39.460 --> 02:43.900
and so the railroad was born, but this introduced a new problem.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.720
Time was still dictated by the sun.

02:46.720 --> 02:50.740
Each town would calculate the local time based upon the location of the sun in the

02:50.740 --> 02:55.860
sky, but this meant that from one town to the next, the time would be different.

02:55.860 --> 03:00.720
In one town it could be 810 and in the next town over, it would be 815.

03:00.720 --> 03:04.660
Both times were correct for the two locations, so this didn't really cause any problems

03:04.660 --> 03:08.140
since it would take hours to get to that next town over.

03:08.140 --> 03:12.180
Across the United States, there were thousands of different local times.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.720
However, with the newly invented railroad, people could get from one town to the next

03:16.720 --> 03:22.040
quickly, but nobody knew when trains really left since everyone used a different time.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.540
The railroad might use one time, while the origin town would use another, and the destination

03:26.540 --> 03:28.920
town would use a completely different one.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.200
Britain solved this problem by creating a standardized time, Greenwich Mean Time, and

03:33.200 --> 03:36.880
transmitting that time across the country by telegraph.

03:36.880 --> 03:42.000
The US decided that, with its huge size, a standard time zone would not work, so four

03:42.020 --> 03:44.800
different time zones were mapped out.

03:44.800 --> 03:49.820
Much like Britain, the standard time would be transmitted across the country by telegraph.

03:49.820 --> 03:53.720
The implementation of this new time zone, however, created one of the stranger days

03:53.720 --> 03:55.540
in human history.

03:55.540 --> 04:00.060
The new eastern time zone ran four minutes behind the time that New York had been using,

04:00.060 --> 04:05.820
so on Sunday, November 18, 1883, the clock struck noon, then four minutes later, the

04:05.820 --> 04:10.220
clock struck noon again as the new time standard was implemented.

04:10.220 --> 04:15.240
The next great innovation in timekeeping came towards the beginning of the 20th century.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.840
Pierre and Jacques Curie, two French physicists, noticed that when electricity was applied

04:19.840 --> 04:23.720
to quartz, it vibrates at an incredibly stable rate.

04:23.720 --> 04:30.020
Knowing that quartz vibrates 32,768 times a second, clockmakers used this crystal to

04:30.020 --> 04:33.140
make incredibly accurate clocks.

04:33.140 --> 04:38.120
These quartz clocks were able to go a month only losing or gaining 15 seconds.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.380
Just as the pendulum clock allowed for the industrial revolution, the quartz clock allowed

04:42.380 --> 04:45.020
for the technological revolution.

04:45.020 --> 04:49.220
Without quartz clocks, modern computers would have been impossible.

04:49.220 --> 04:54.480
An accurate internal clock is needed to coordinate all the different microprocessors.

04:54.480 --> 04:58.740
With these new accurate clocks, however, people also began to notice that earth's rotation

04:58.740 --> 05:00.820
wasn't all that regular.

05:00.820 --> 05:04.260
It deviated by a few seconds here and there.

05:04.260 --> 05:09.880
In the 1950s, the first super-accurate atomic clocks were built, measuring time based upon

05:09.880 --> 05:14.240
the decay of atomic elements, and this allowed an international conference of weight and

05:14.240 --> 05:18.600
measures to change what time was in 1967.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.020
They decided that a day was no longer one rotation of the earth.

05:22.020 --> 05:26.280
A day was now 86,400 atomic seconds.

05:26.280 --> 05:32.320
Since the time it takes for earth to rotate is not exactly 86,400 atomic seconds, we make

05:32.320 --> 05:36.740
up for this by having leap days and leap seconds every once in a while.

05:36.740 --> 05:41.540
The atomic clock also allowed for nanosecond accuracy, and this is actually pretty important

05:41.540 --> 05:45.220
for many modern technologies, most notably the GPS.

05:45.220 --> 05:52.220
GPS works by asking three different satellites the time based upon their onboard atomic clocks.

05:52.220 --> 05:56.700
When the answer comes back, each time will be slightly different on a nanosecond level

05:56.700 --> 06:01.060
due to the satellites being at different distances and the request for the time going at only

06:01.060 --> 06:02.060
the speed of light.

06:02.060 --> 06:07.260
So the GPS, knowing the location of the satellites based upon their extremely predictable orbits,

06:07.260 --> 06:09.660
can figure out where it is.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.880
So that's how time developed.

06:11.880 --> 06:16.700
Hopefully you can now see how the human conception of time was essential for the development

06:16.700 --> 06:23.920
of our modern world and can still be called one of humanity's greatest inventions.

06:23.920 --> 06:31.060
Today we're going to talk about space law.

06:31.060 --> 06:35.480
So back in ye old days, property owners had the rights to their land going up forever

06:35.480 --> 06:37.780
and ever in perpetuity.

06:37.780 --> 06:41.360
But then the airplane came around and smart people realized that you couldn't just go

06:41.360 --> 06:45.400
around asking every property owner for permission to fly through their airspace.
