1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
2022 was just another year. There was death, and there was destruction, and there was disease,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,880
and there were wildfires, and hurricanes, and earthquakes, and drought, and poverty,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,720
and pollution, and war, and terrorism, and habitat destruction, and rising temperatures,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,240
and human rights violations, and dysfunctional political systems, and widening wealth inequality,

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,120
and worrisome leaps forward in AI, and steps towards the precipice of nuclear Armageddon,

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,800
and an ever-present inclination that the present degree of chaos truly is unprecedented.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,680
These issues matter, but they're not the only things that matter. Through it all, the world

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,960
got better. Whether it balanced out to a net improvement is perhaps up for debate,

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,600
but the fact that things did get better is not. We are leaving 2022 without problems with which

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,880
we entered 2022. This matters. The world of the future is defined by the actions of today,

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,840
so just as much as we fight against and lament against the issues of today, we should celebrate

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,320
the successes that compound into a ceaseless inclined march of human progress. So, that's

13
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,440
what we'll do. For our final video of 2022, we'll cover 22 problems solved this year. Some mean

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,880
little in the grand scheme, others could define society within a few more trips around the sun.

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Some were celebrated by few, others consumed our media for days. And some might not be accepted

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,280
by all, but none portray a meaningfully contested position as a solution. Rather, in the fine scrub

17
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,480
of it, they portray the democratic system as a potential process through which problems can

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:49,120
and do get solved. Like all else, solutions should be celebrated when and where they happen.

19
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,920
So, to start our story of 22 problems the world solved in 2022, let's start beyond it—in the

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,480
cosmic. In a perfect world, we'd solve potential problems before they materialized—we'd be

21
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:08,160
proactive. While this isn't a perfect world and we generally aren't proactive, we, or more accurately

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,360
NASA, did solve one potentially enormous problem well ahead of time with its Double Asteroid

23
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,440
Redirection Test, or DART. This September, after ten months since launch, the test accumulated in

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
a 1,300-pound or 600-kilogram spacecraft roughly the size of a refrigerator smashing head-on into

25
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,320
an asteroid called Dimorphis. Now, Dimorphis wasn't actually headed towards Earth—it was just

26
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,680
orbiting around another larger asteroid, Didymos, some seven to ten million miles away. Instead,

27
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,320
this was a test to see if ramming into an asteroid would knock it off its course—a concern of

28
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,800
existential proportion in the event that one beelines towards us in the near future.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,600
Fortunately, the test was a success beyond expectations. After the collision, Dimorphis

30
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,240
was pushed about 500 feet closer to Didymos, shortening its orbit by 32 minutes which,

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,440
for NASA employees expecting a change in course around 10 to 20 minutes,

32
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,080
was a major proof of concept and a first success for their planetary defense strategy.

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,640
In existential news of the terrestrial variety, the United States agreed to join the Kigali

34
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,400
Amendment this year as part of the federal government's efforts to phase out the most

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,840
problematic carbon substances. This amendment follows the 1987 Montreal Protocol, a climate

36
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,440
treaty that phased out 100 types of ozone-depleting chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,720
which started destroying Earth's ozone layer. The problem was, manufacturers replaced CFCs with

38
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,320
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which aren't great either. While the ozone hole did get smaller,

39
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,080
HFCs have a far worse greenhouse effect than CO2. Whereas carbon dioxide has a warming potential

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,640
of 1 based on its ability to trap heat, and methane has a warming potential of 34,

41
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,840
HFCs have warming potentials ranging from 1,370 to 4,180, which makes them way worse

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,040
for climate change. So, the Kigali Amendment expands on those original ozone-depleters to

43
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,640
phase out 100% of HFCs, which means manufacturers in the US and most of the rest of the world won't

44
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,600
be able to use these compounds at all by 2050. While HFCs are out as of this year,

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,040
comeback stories are in. In an age of massive biodiversity loss, it turns out that some animal

46
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,960
species are making dramatic recoveries. Across Europe, over 50 species are returning in record

47
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,240
numbers after reintroduction to expanded habitats across the continent. For example, the European

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,520
bison has made a spectacular comeback despite having been thought to be extinct in the 1920s.

49
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,560
Since 1971, their populations alone have increased by 399%, with reintroductions in Belarus,

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and now the United Kingdom. The first

51
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,440
baby European bison born in the UK in thousands of years was introduced this summer in Kent,

52
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,080
where it can help reduce flood risk and restore a diverse ecosystem, which can help slow the effects

53
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,080
of climate change. And while this news doesn't cancel out the global mass extinction event

54
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,560
currently underway, it presents a roadmap to getting back to biodiverse and resilient

55
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,440
ecosystems. Turns out, when humans step back and give animals just a bit of breathing room,

56
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,320
they can return from the brink and even thrive. Another scientific advancement that helps life

57
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,760
thrive is the vaccine. In 2021, the first ever vaccine was approved by the World Health

58
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:25,120
Organization to prevent malaria. This year, researchers doubled down on the progress with

59
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,920
a huge breakthrough. Malaria is a mosquito-transmitted disease that kills more than a

60
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,120
half million people each year, making it the sixth leading cause of death in low-income countries,

61
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,440
mostly found in Africa. Nearly 80% of these deaths are children. It's an exceptionally large problem

62
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,240
for Africans especially, not only in lives lost, but also in terms of economic impacts due to

63
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,760
healthcare costs, absenteeism from work and school, reduced tourism, and lost workforce.

64
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,560
The good news is that increasingly, there's a solution. This new vaccine attacks the parasite

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,960
early in its infection by intercepting before entry into the liver, using a combination of

66
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,240
proteins from both malaria parasites and the hepatitis B virus. That's the key here. By using

67
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,800
more of the malaria protein, a University of Oxford team came up with a second vaccine that's

68
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,600
even more effective in clinical trials than the version released in 2021. Both still await the

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,480
result of a larger trial, but an Indian vaccine manufacturer is prepared to make more than 100

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,280
million doses once it's officially approved. Either way, the fact that there is now potential

71
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,640
options to fight malaria before its destructive symptoms start is truly a medical miracle that

72
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,440
will save millions of lives. From one vector-borne disease to another, there likely will soon also

73
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,880
be a Lyme disease vaccine. But this is less a medical miracle and more of a what-took-so-long

74
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
story. Right at the intersection of climate change, mistrust of experts, and for-profit

75
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,800
medicine sits Lyme disease. Because temperatures continue to rise, more of the US and Europe is

76
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,160
hospitable for Lyme-toting ticks, and because of vaccine hesitancy in the 1990s, your dog can get

77
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,920
a proactive shot, but you can't. Due to these factors, Lyme disease has doubled in the US since

78
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:10,080
1991, and has become the most common vector-borne disease in the US. Relief, though, may be in sight

79
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,600
as a vaccine entered final clinical trials this year. VLA-15, as the medicine is called,

80
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,600
has been administered to 6,000 participants in the US and Europe. Perhaps, though, VLA-15 is

81
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,200
more notable for what it isn't—Lymerics, which was once a publicly available Lyme vaccine.

82
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,680
Lymerics had its problems—it required three doses, was only available to people older than

83
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,560
15, and wasn't exactly cheap. Now the makers of VLA-15 are working hard to avoid these shortcomings.

84
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,960
But what led to Lymerics being pulled from the market is ultimately something drug makers can't

85
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,400
control—snowballing vaccine hesitancy. In the end, it was unsubstantiated but

86
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,560
hypothetically possible claims that Lymerics could cause autoimmune disease that ended

87
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,840
Lymerics in the late 90s. Since then, the disease has spread across the US and hesitancy over

88
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,280
vaccines has dug deeper than ever, so quite a lot rides on this trial and the public's response to it.

89
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,360
An expectation-laden trial of the sports world ended this year with a landmark labor agreement

90
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,400
more than six years in the making. In 2016, the US women's national soccer team sued the

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,040
US Soccer Federation for gender discrimination. Although their case was thrown out by a federal

92
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,600
court in 2020, the dispute stretched on until their counterparts on the US men's national

93
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,520
soccer team helped broker a payment deal this year—a first-of-its-kind strategy among the

94
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,680
three organizations that sets the bar for international athletics. While the men's side

95
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,320
gets paid more per win due to FIFA's pay structure, the women's side consistently performs better,

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,840
having won the 2015 and 2019 World Cups and Olympic medals in 2016 and 2020, meaning they're

97
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,160
more likely to get the grand prize for winning the cup. So, they've decided to pool their winnings and

98
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,160
split them equally, which means all players will benefit from either team's advancement in

99
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,640
tournaments. This solution demonstrates how sports teams can challenge sports leagues in equities and

100
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,640
help their teams level up both on and off the field. Another measure that's driving equity

101
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,200
comes on a plate. When COVID hit, the federal government passed an emergency act that provided

102
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,680
free school-based breakfast and lunch for almost all students in America. This was a way to make

103
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,840
sure kids were eating, even when their families weren't doing well financially, and getting full,

104
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,280
nutritious meals, besides being a basic necessity, is linked to better grades and fewer absences.

105
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,360
So, when congressional Republicans blocked a measure to keep the free meal waivers in place,

106
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,680
California, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Connecticut took it upon themselves

107
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,840
to continue the program. Colorado also just approved a ballot measure that makes free

108
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,760
school lunch available to all, and at least five other states have introduced universal

109
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,720
meals legislation. The idea is that by offering free meals, it destigmatizes the practice for

110
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,120
those who depend on it and includes students who may not necessarily qualify for free or reduced

111
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,920
lunch, but still need it. Roughly one in six children aren't getting enough to eat nationally,

112
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,000
and getting to the point where it's a federally funded program for all students may be an uphill

113
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,480
climb. But in the states where it's implemented, like California where nearly six million students

114
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,760
benefit from the program, it's working. Like a lot of social issues, it has to start somewhere.

115
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,240
A development we all may well benefit from in the near future started somewhere in Europe this year.

116
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,720
That's because the European Parliament voted almost unanimously to adopt a universal charging

117
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,240
port standard by 2024, agreeing upon USBC for portable devices. The initial announcement

118
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,400
obviously made the world's number one tech company, Apple, a bit ruffle because it runs

119
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,800
its iPhones on the proprietary Lightning cable, maintaining a corporate strategy that all things

120
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,000
begin and end under it. But, they capitulated this time, and all iPhones will now make the

121
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,840
transition to the USBC design, more commonly found on Android devices. Upon making the announcement,

122
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,880
Apple's Greg Joswiak said the switch would affect one billion people worldwide. Not only does it

123
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,840
streamline tech for the users, but it'll speed things up as the USBC cable transmits data quicker

124
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,680
than Apple's Lightning cable. Additionally, standardizing ports will save $338 million in

125
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,440
e-waste per year, according to one European report. So really, this is just good news for anyone with

126
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,560
a phone. And in good news for anyone with a car, electric vehicle markets around the world have

127
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,960
surpassed the so-called tipping point for electric vehicle adoption, with the United States hitting

128
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,680
the threshold this year. According to the diffusion of innovation theory pioneered by communication

129
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,080
theorist E.M. Rogers, the rate at which a new product becomes popular after entering the market

130
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,280
looks like this—an S-curve. Sales initially comprise only a small share of people, known as

131
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,520
the innovators and early adopters, and the innovation might still fizzle out. But once

132
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,760
it reaches this critical inflection point, it is considered validated as an innovation,

133
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,280
starts to enter the mainstream, and growth picks up rapidly. For EVs, the inflection point is

134
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,240
generally accepted as 5% of total vehicle sales, so after countries hit this mark, there's a

135
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,000
corresponding surge in popularity which means the US could soon see EV adoption spread even faster,

136
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
especially considering the expanded EV tax credits authorized in the recent Inflation Reduction Act.

137
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,240
With the addition of the US, 19 countries now have EV industries that comprise 5% or more of

138
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,280
total vehicle purchases, also including the United Kingdom, Norway, South Korea, and Germany. In

139
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,880
South Korea, EV sales have already increased to 21% of the market, while in Norway, they comprise

140
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,480
over 83%. No one knows exactly how many orphaned oil and gas wells dot the US—they just know there

141
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,160
are a lot, perhaps as many as 3 million, and that they're leaking methane, and a lot of it. Abandoned

142
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,400
and incorrectly capped wells are bad for water quality through what they spew locally, and are

143
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,720
devastating for the climate through the highly variable, sometimes extreme amount of greenhouse

144
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,880
gases they release into the atmosphere. The good news is that they were considered in the

145
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,400
Infrastructure Bill. The legislation earmarked $4.7 billion for identifying and capping these

146
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,440
wells, which is the largest sum ever committed to legacy polluters. In August, the project

147
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,400
officially began when the Department of the Interior released $560 million to 24 states

148
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,120
to begin capping high-priority wells on private and public lands. Each state is approaching the

149
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,240
project slightly differently. Some, like Ohio and New Mexico, are prioritizing work in disadvantaged

150
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,200
communities. Others, like Arizona and Montana, are working to ensure that small businesses are

151
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,240
awarded contracts to do the work. Regardless of approach, the process of identifying, measuring,

152
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,240
and eventually filling the wells with concrete is labor-intensive and expensive to the point

153
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,080
that Pennsylvania prices the capping of a single well at $33,000. But as an upside,

154
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,720
this serves as an example as to how job creation can be built around curbing emissions.

155
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Another win for human health this year recognized the benefits of broadening access to nature for

156
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,040
mental well-being. Spending at least two hours in nature per week is linked to reduced blood

157
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,040
pressure and stress levels, as well as lowered anxiety and depression, according to studies

158
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
published in Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And now,

159
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
doctors in Canada can prescribe nature to their patients through the PARx program,

160
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,840
which covers the cost of a park pass for patients who could benefit from more time spent in nature.

161
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,880
Originally piloted in British Columbia by Dr. Melissa Lem,

162
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,640
Canada has now broadened the program to include every province because of its success,

163
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:05,680
as it can ease symptoms of health conditions ranging from ADHD to heart disease to diabetes.

164
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Canadians can now visit any of Canada's 80 national parks for free if their doctor

165
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,840
prescribes it, and other governments, like the Weld County Health Department in Colorado,

166
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,520
have followed suit to help more people access the healing power of nature.

167
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,680
Mental health has also been top of mind at the Pentagon. Suicide is an intensely difficult

168
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,920
problem to solve. As Secretary of the Army Christine Warmoth rightly put it,

169
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,720
quote, one suicide is one too many. But the daunting challenge of eliminating suicide

170
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,840
in the armed forces hasn't stopped military leaders from trying. In the second half of 2021,

171
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,800
after an increase in suicides in 2020 compared to the year prior, the Army implemented a new

172
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,360
suicide prevention policy for the fiscal year of 2022. Military wellness checks, suicide prevention

173
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,200
teaching and training, new handbooks for senior commanders on mental health, and integrated

174
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,280
prevention efforts aimed to create positive climates were some of the main tenets established

175
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,760
in the comprehensive overhaul. While these practices in name border on military jargon,

176
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,120
it's clear that the increased focus is working as active-duty Army suicides dropped 21% along

177
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,480
with declines in family member and civilian staff suicides through the first three quarters of 2022.

178
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,640
The effort goes beyond the Army too, as the Department of Defense has worked hard to counter

179
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,560
dated assumptions concerning mental wellness and has begun the process of hiring an additional

180
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,000
2,000 mental health personnel while continuing to develop strategies that

181
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,680
de-stigmatize searching out help. Remember mRNA vaccine technology—the innovation

182
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
that was successfully implemented for the first time in COVID-19 immunizations?

183
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
Thanks to that, it's now being tested to protect against HIV, too. Unlike traditional vaccines,

184
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,880
which inject a weakened virus into our bodies to trigger an immune response,

185
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,280
messenger RNA is genetic material that tells our bodies how to make proteins.

186
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,040
Researchers had been experimenting with it for years, but they went into overdrive to

187
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,280
specifically create mRNA that teaches spike proteins how to ward off COVID.

188
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,960
Now, the National Institutes of Health is running a series of trials to see if this

189
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,920
same idea can be applied to HIV—a virus that has defied successful vaccines since the 1980s

190
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,280
when it emerged, and has since killed more than 40 million people. If successful in this stage,

191
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,760
the vaccine would then go on to efficiency trials, and cautiously optimistic scientists

192
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,200
said there could be a promising inoculation within a couple of years.

193
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,160
The pandemic caused art museum attendance and budgets to plummet,

194
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,000
and one way institutions combated this was to sell art from their collections,

195
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
aka deaccessioning it, to raise funds to pay for things like salaries and maintenance.

196
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,120
The issue is that this practice was previously banned by the Association of Art Museum Directors,

197
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,200
who argued that pieces should be kept in public collections, or that museums would sell off their

198
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,520
most valuable pieces for the most profitable return. The board temporarily allowed it for

199
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,240
two years during COVID, but like a lot of pandemic pivots, this one is sticking around.

200
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,160
Recently, the same group voted to let museums sell their works to finance caring for their

201
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
collections, with some serious guardrails, including restrictions that funds cannot pay

202
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,800
for salaries, but have to go directly to the works themselves, such as buying acid-free paper,

203
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,960
frames, and storage material. In the long run, however, it keeps museums open,

204
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,280
and that's probably the biggest win for everyone.

205
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,320
More efficient running was also the story for the world's fleet of motorized two-wheelers in 2022.

206
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,200
More specifically, it was a great year for the Taiwanese battery company Gogoro. Gogoro

207
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,760
built swappable batteries and charging stations for electric motorbikes across Taiwan, and in

208
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,760
August they announced a major milestone—they had reached 500,000 subscribers to their swappable

209
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,000
battery network. In September, they announced that their operation, which had already spread

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,120
across all of Taiwan with 2,200 swap stations, was expanding into Israel and Singapore.

211
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,160
While the conversation around EVs often revolves around cars, the arrival and expansion of

212
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,480
swappable batteries and electric motorized two-wheelers is critically important in places

213
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,200
like Southeast Asia, where around 80% of households own motorized bikes. Not only are

214
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,000
these bikes incredibly numerous, they're notoriously dirty. The average two-stroke

215
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,800
engine rickshaw emits the same amount of soot as ten Jeeps, making a transition to electric

216
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,720
all the more exciting. Already, Gogoro by itself accounts for 25% of the new two-wheelers sold in

217
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,080
Taiwan, while a host of other Asian manufacturers, like Honda, are looking to crack into the market.

218
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,320
Though swappable batteries are yet to prove viable in cars, Gogoro's subscription service

219
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,600
provides users an important alternative to power transportation.

220
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,920
Major technology developments haven't been confined to roadways, either. Ethereum is one

221
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,560
of the most important open-source blockchains in the world, and its native currency, Ether,

222
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:37,520
has the second-largest market capitalization of any cryptocurrency. In other words,

223
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
Ethereum's massive, so when it completely flipped its validation model in September,

224
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,480
it was a big deal. Prior to the flip, Ethereum, like nearly all other blockchains,

225
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,960
used the proof-of-work model, where miners and their powerful computers verify transactions

226
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,520
and create blocks. But this year, Ethereum flipped to what is called the proof-of-stake model,

227
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,760
which opens up the process of transaction verification and blockmaking to any potential

228
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,800
validator willing to stake their own Ether as insurance. Now, the very reason crypto mining

229
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,360
exists is to ensure transactional security and accuracy, and that's where the stake comes in.

230
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,000
Should a transaction be incorrectly verified, then the penalty is taken out of the stake.

231
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,440
Like all things crypto and blockchain, the mechanics of this flip are complicated,

232
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,520
but this is a world-altering change as proof-of-stake opens the door for further

233
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,600
decentralization and, most importantly, it slashes energy consumption by a shocking 99.95%.

234
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,720
The transitions already prove nothing short of revolutionary as Ethereum's co-founder has

235
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,320
stated that the merge has lowered the world's energy consumption by 0.2%,

236
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,680
an incredible accomplishment that benefits everyone regardless of their thoughts on crypto.

237
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,000
So, security for a different sort of product, this time baseball memorabilia, is probably an issue

238
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,360
that you didn't know was an issue. Collecting things from baseball games, bats, balls, bases,

239
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,520
is quite popular and lucrative in the industry, especially when they're used to set a record,

240
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,880
like Aaron Judge's historic 62nd home run of the season this fall. Forgeries used to run rampant,

241
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,600
with some estimates indicating that three-quarters of autographs were fake in the 1990s.

242
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,640
The MLB and FBI set out to solve this problem, increasingly adding levels of authentication and

243
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,840
protection, and 2022 was a year for the ultimate in standard setting. Once an item is played,

244
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,280
so to speak, an authenticator stands as a witness and official signator. The item, let's say Judge's

245
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,480
62nd home run ball, is then authenticated with an official MLB hologram, one that previously

246
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,600
included a serial number. Now that special hologram is a security lockbox with a two-letter

247
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,480
prefix, a serial number, a QR code, and a validation code all affixed to a tamper-proof

248
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,280
hologram. That's all traceable back to its origins in a standard database which includes some 6

249
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,760
million authenticated items to date. This is useful for everything from small nonprofit

250
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,760
auctions to headline-making ones, such as for Judge's ball, which is reportedly up for more

251
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:59,120
than $3 million. In ecologically useful news, this year marked the end of a 20-year long battle to

252
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,520
demolish four dams on the lower Klamath River in southern Oregon and northern California that will

253
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,960
the biggest river restoration project in US history. On November 17th, the Federal Energy

254
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,800
Regulatory Commission authorized the demolition of these dams, which have cut off salmon from

255
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,560
their annual patterns of migration for over a century. With over 400 miles or 640 kilometers

256
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,840
of salmon spawning habitat gone, large populations have simply vanished—all because of these dams'

257
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,880
dam presence. Salmon are a keystone species, and without healthy numbers of them swimming upstream,

258
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,200
spawning the upper basin, and later dying there, the river's sediment became trapped behind dams

259
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,080
and without the same levels of ecologically valuable fatty acids left behind by dead salmon.

260
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,520
This amount created a rapid outgrowth of algae throughout the Klamath River,

261
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,560
including ceratinova shasta, a strain that killed off 70% of juvenile salmon in 2020.

262
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,280
And although these dams did provide hydroelectric power, they are no longer necessary for energy

263
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
generation with new local wind power installations that have more than met the region's electric

264
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,600
needs. So, here's to hoping that 2023 will be the year of Klamath River salmon finally returning

265
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,880
home. Information flows freely on the internet, and one of the unmanaged wormholes on the web

266
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,200
is deepfakes—digitally altered photos and videos of real people that are manipulated,

267
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,800
typically to spread false information. Now, Intel announced they've developed a

268
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,760
solution called FakeCatcher, which they claim can detect artificial videos with up to 96%

269
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,480
accuracy in real time. The company's software scans the pixels in a video for slight changes

270
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,800
in facial blood flow, detecting what's real about a video, and some other technologies that require

271
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,800
raw data to be uploaded, then scan for inconsistencies that could be flagged as fake—a

272
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,840
cumbersome and hours-long process. The program is hosted on a server and runs through a web-based

273
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,240
platform, meaning it can easily be used by social media sites and news organizations—two of the

274
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,560
biggest opportunity markets for technology like this, where lookalike videos run rampant.

275
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,840
Perfluorical and polyfluorical substances, or PFAs, are complex human-made chemicals.

276
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,640
They are both scary and hard to pronounce, so they are more commonly called forever chemicals.

277
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,200
These unnatural creations just don't go away on their own—rather than degrade or dissipate,

278
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,320
they stick around in our environment, in our water systems, and in our bodies pretty much forever.

279
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,800
Originating in the 1930s and 40s, and made infamous by DuPont's Teflon plant poisoning

280
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,840
the town of Parksburg, West Virginia for much of the second half of the century,

281
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,920
PFAs have proved both extremely helpful for nonstick cooking, fire suppression,

282
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,160
and countless manufacturing processes, while also extremely damaging to human health,

283
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,520
leading to cancer, reproductive problems, and endocrine disruption.

284
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,320
So, we've kept using them, kept getting sick from them, but haven't found a way to get rid of them.

285
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,720
That was until this year when the long process of developing a cost-effective solution for

286
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,800
breaking these chemical compounds down was published in the journal Science.

287
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,760
It turns out the solutions… well, a solution, as scientist Brittany Trang found that mixing PFAs

288
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,560
with the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSL, the chemicals sodium hydroxide, and water,

289
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:55,200
then bringing the mix to a boil broke the dangerous compounds into harmless fragments.

290
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,040
One application of this would be to treat drinking water, helping more than 2,000 American

291
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,200
cities with PFA levels above the Environmental Protection Agency limit, according to one

292
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,760
environmental advocacy group. While remarkably simple, the development is critically important

293
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,640
in the fight to break these PFAs down as tens of thousands of tons of these chemicals are released

294
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:20,480
into the environment every single year. The United States abolished slavery in 1865.

295
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,320
Well, it abolished most slavery. For over 160 years, there's existed a single glaring

296
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:32,000
exception in the 13th Amendment—that slavery was unconstitutional except as a punishment for crime,

297
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,440
something that prisons have relied on ever since. This year, four states—Alabama, Oregon,

298
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,680
Tennessee, and Vermont—closed this loophole to involuntary servitude with ballot measures that

299
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,640
repealed the exception. In doing so, they joined Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, and Rhode Island in

300
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,440
entirely nixing any form of slavery from their state constitutions. The issue also appeared on

301
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,400
ballots in Louisiana during this year's midterms, where it failed. This failure, however, is less an

302
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,280
indictment of the state, and more so a recognition of the importance of the exact language used.

303
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,280
In Louisiana, some early proponents of the amendment actually decided to push against

304
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,360
the bill as the wording had the potential to expand the use of involuntary labor in the state,

305
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,840
while rank-and-file voters simply couldn't parse what the amendment's wording would actually change.

306
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,280
Across the board, prison labor creates $2 billion a year in goods and provides $9 billion worth of

307
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,160
facilities maintenance, while prison laborers, some 800,000 in number, make on average less than

308
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,520
a dollar an hour and some don't make any money at all. While banning slavery ends in voluntary

309
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,240
labor, prison labor still figures to be important for upkeep of facilities and a major cog in what

310
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,680
keeps prisons running. Now, though, at very least, it is explicitly a matter of choice for prisoners

311
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,200
to partake in seven states. The final breakthrough of 2022 could,

312
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,160
when looked back on in the future, carry with it perhaps the most profound implications of them all,

313
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,640
as this December, the US announced the biggest step towards virtually limitless green energy to date.

314
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
The announcement came out of a much-anticipated Department of Energy press conference, while the

315
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,000
breakthrough itself came in the form of nuclear fusion. Today, all nuclear power plants rely on

316
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,720
fission—the splitting of atoms—to create energy, while fusion—the smashing together of atoms—has

317
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,080
remained the unrealized, theoretically possible, but brutally difficult to actualize alternative.

318
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,640
Unlike fission, fusion doesn't create nuclear waste. Also unlike fission, we haven't figured

319
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,360
out how to effectively harness fusion. But we're getting closer. For the first time ever,

320
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,080
an American lab produced more energy through fusion than what was used to create the reaction.

321
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,400
Firing hydrogen-rich pellets into a series of high-powered lasers, scientists at the Lawrence

322
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,320
Livermore National Laboratory were able to create explosions that gave off energy in the form of

323
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,680
heat for a fraction of a second—enough energy to boil roughly 10 kettles of water. For a project

324
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,480
that has cost somewhere near $3.5 billion, 10 kettles of water doesn't seem like much,

325
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,720
but proving that ignition is possible is a critical step going forward.

326
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
Next up is finding a way to maintain these reactions for longer than a fraction of a second,

327
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,640
and while the development timeline is still likely too long for fission to prove a viable

328
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,120
solution to the climate crisis, this represents an incredible milestone towards a future of

329
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,800
low-cost, pollution-free energy abundance as yet confined to only the most imaginative science

330
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,800
fiction. I had a minor, ultimately meaningless personal problem that I figured out a few years

331
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:22,160
ago, so I want to talk to you about what I found as a solution. You see, I really enjoy the fun,

332
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,200
calming process of putting on some music, maybe lighting a candle, and just making a home-cooked

333
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,000
meal. The problem was, by the time I stopped by the grocery store, unloaded the car, gathered all

334
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,560
the ingredients, prepped, cooked, and cleaned, it was almost time to go to sleep and my evening was

335
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,200
basically gone. The only alternatives were to pay a huge amount for some lukewarm delivery food,

336
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,400
or to microwave some frozen food that really wasn't good or healthy—until I found HelloFresh.

337
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,720
This is all true—I started my subscription in 2020 just by researching what the best meal

338
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,240
subscription box was—these are all the recipe cards that I've accumulated to prove it—and

339
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,560
it was only a year and a half later that they came along and started sponsoring my channels.

340
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,360
So, if you have this same problem of not having the time to but enjoying making home-cooked meals,

341
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,960
then this is the solution that I actually found and kept using myself before I had any financial

342
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,440
incentive to do so. Beyond the time-saving factor, research on HelloFresh has found that,

343
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,880
on average, it works out to 25% cheaper and less caloric than takeout, and slightly cheaper than

344
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,280
grocery shopping. But the most important thing is that it's just easier—everything comes in

345
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,040
the exact quantities you need, with some ingredients already prepared, so you skip to

346
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,600
the nice part of cooking, not the measuring and mixing. And the food's actually good, and usually

347
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,840
more varied than cooking with grocery ingredients since you get to pick one of dozens of meals each

348
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,920
week. So, if you want to solve this problem in your life, click the button on screen or
