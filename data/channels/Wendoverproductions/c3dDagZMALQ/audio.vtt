00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
2022 was just another year. There was death, and there was destruction, and there was disease,

00:06.880 --> 00:12.880
and there were wildfires, and hurricanes, and earthquakes, and drought, and poverty,

00:12.880 --> 00:18.720
and pollution, and war, and terrorism, and habitat destruction, and rising temperatures,

00:18.720 --> 00:24.240
and human rights violations, and dysfunctional political systems, and widening wealth inequality,

00:24.240 --> 00:29.120
and worrisome leaps forward in AI, and steps towards the precipice of nuclear Armageddon,

00:29.120 --> 00:34.800
and an ever-present inclination that the present degree of chaos truly is unprecedented.

00:35.440 --> 00:41.680
These issues matter, but they're not the only things that matter. Through it all, the world

00:41.680 --> 00:46.960
got better. Whether it balanced out to a net improvement is perhaps up for debate,

00:46.960 --> 00:53.600
but the fact that things did get better is not. We are leaving 2022 without problems with which

00:53.600 --> 01:00.880
we entered 2022. This matters. The world of the future is defined by the actions of today,

01:00.880 --> 01:05.840
so just as much as we fight against and lament against the issues of today, we should celebrate

01:05.840 --> 01:12.320
the successes that compound into a ceaseless inclined march of human progress. So, that's

01:12.320 --> 01:19.440
what we'll do. For our final video of 2022, we'll cover 22 problems solved this year. Some mean

01:19.440 --> 01:24.880
little in the grand scheme, others could define society within a few more trips around the sun.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.880
Some were celebrated by few, others consumed our media for days. And some might not be accepted

01:30.880 --> 01:37.280
by all, but none portray a meaningfully contested position as a solution. Rather, in the fine scrub

01:37.280 --> 01:42.480
of it, they portray the democratic system as a potential process through which problems can

01:42.480 --> 01:49.120
and do get solved. Like all else, solutions should be celebrated when and where they happen.

01:49.200 --> 01:55.920
So, to start our story of 22 problems the world solved in 2022, let's start beyond it—in the

01:55.920 --> 02:02.480
cosmic. In a perfect world, we'd solve potential problems before they materialized—we'd be

02:02.480 --> 02:08.160
proactive. While this isn't a perfect world and we generally aren't proactive, we, or more accurately

02:08.160 --> 02:13.360
NASA, did solve one potentially enormous problem well ahead of time with its Double Asteroid

02:13.360 --> 02:19.440
Redirection Test, or DART. This September, after ten months since launch, the test accumulated in

02:19.440 --> 02:25.200
a 1,300-pound or 600-kilogram spacecraft roughly the size of a refrigerator smashing head-on into

02:25.200 --> 02:30.320
an asteroid called Dimorphis. Now, Dimorphis wasn't actually headed towards Earth—it was just

02:30.320 --> 02:35.680
orbiting around another larger asteroid, Didymos, some seven to ten million miles away. Instead,

02:35.680 --> 02:40.320
this was a test to see if ramming into an asteroid would knock it off its course—a concern of

02:40.320 --> 02:44.800
existential proportion in the event that one beelines towards us in the near future.

02:44.800 --> 02:49.600
Fortunately, the test was a success beyond expectations. After the collision, Dimorphis

02:49.600 --> 02:54.240
was pushed about 500 feet closer to Didymos, shortening its orbit by 32 minutes which,

02:54.240 --> 02:57.440
for NASA employees expecting a change in course around 10 to 20 minutes,

02:57.440 --> 03:02.080
was a major proof of concept and a first success for their planetary defense strategy.

03:04.160 --> 03:08.640
In existential news of the terrestrial variety, the United States agreed to join the Kigali

03:08.640 --> 03:12.400
Amendment this year as part of the federal government's efforts to phase out the most

03:12.400 --> 03:17.840
problematic carbon substances. This amendment follows the 1987 Montreal Protocol, a climate

03:17.840 --> 03:23.440
treaty that phased out 100 types of ozone-depleting chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,

03:23.440 --> 03:28.720
which started destroying Earth's ozone layer. The problem was, manufacturers replaced CFCs with

03:28.720 --> 03:34.320
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which aren't great either. While the ozone hole did get smaller,

03:34.400 --> 03:40.080
HFCs have a far worse greenhouse effect than CO2. Whereas carbon dioxide has a warming potential

03:40.080 --> 03:44.640
of 1 based on its ability to trap heat, and methane has a warming potential of 34,

03:44.640 --> 03:51.840
HFCs have warming potentials ranging from 1,370 to 4,180, which makes them way worse

03:51.840 --> 03:57.040
for climate change. So, the Kigali Amendment expands on those original ozone-depleters to

03:57.040 --> 04:02.640
phase out 100% of HFCs, which means manufacturers in the US and most of the rest of the world won't

04:02.640 --> 04:09.600
be able to use these compounds at all by 2050. While HFCs are out as of this year,

04:09.600 --> 04:15.040
comeback stories are in. In an age of massive biodiversity loss, it turns out that some animal

04:15.040 --> 04:20.960
species are making dramatic recoveries. Across Europe, over 50 species are returning in record

04:20.960 --> 04:26.240
numbers after reintroduction to expanded habitats across the continent. For example, the European

04:26.240 --> 04:31.520
bison has made a spectacular comeback despite having been thought to be extinct in the 1920s.

04:31.520 --> 04:38.560
Since 1971, their populations alone have increased by 399%, with reintroductions in Belarus,

04:38.560 --> 04:44.480
Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and now the United Kingdom. The first

04:44.480 --> 04:49.440
baby European bison born in the UK in thousands of years was introduced this summer in Kent,

04:49.440 --> 04:54.080
where it can help reduce flood risk and restore a diverse ecosystem, which can help slow the effects

04:54.080 --> 04:58.080
of climate change. And while this news doesn't cancel out the global mass extinction event

04:58.080 --> 05:02.560
currently underway, it presents a roadmap to getting back to biodiverse and resilient

05:02.560 --> 05:07.440
ecosystems. Turns out, when humans step back and give animals just a bit of breathing room,

05:07.440 --> 05:14.320
they can return from the brink and even thrive. Another scientific advancement that helps life

05:14.320 --> 05:19.760
thrive is the vaccine. In 2021, the first ever vaccine was approved by the World Health

05:19.760 --> 05:25.120
Organization to prevent malaria. This year, researchers doubled down on the progress with

05:25.120 --> 05:29.920
a huge breakthrough. Malaria is a mosquito-transmitted disease that kills more than a

05:29.920 --> 05:35.120
half million people each year, making it the sixth leading cause of death in low-income countries,

05:35.120 --> 05:41.440
mostly found in Africa. Nearly 80% of these deaths are children. It's an exceptionally large problem

05:41.440 --> 05:46.240
for Africans especially, not only in lives lost, but also in terms of economic impacts due to

05:46.240 --> 05:51.760
healthcare costs, absenteeism from work and school, reduced tourism, and lost workforce.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.560
The good news is that increasingly, there's a solution. This new vaccine attacks the parasite

05:56.560 --> 06:00.960
early in its infection by intercepting before entry into the liver, using a combination of

06:00.960 --> 06:06.240
proteins from both malaria parasites and the hepatitis B virus. That's the key here. By using

06:06.240 --> 06:10.800
more of the malaria protein, a University of Oxford team came up with a second vaccine that's

06:10.800 --> 06:15.600
even more effective in clinical trials than the version released in 2021. Both still await the

06:15.600 --> 06:20.480
result of a larger trial, but an Indian vaccine manufacturer is prepared to make more than 100

06:20.480 --> 06:25.280
million doses once it's officially approved. Either way, the fact that there is now potential

06:25.280 --> 06:30.640
options to fight malaria before its destructive symptoms start is truly a medical miracle that

06:30.640 --> 06:37.440
will save millions of lives. From one vector-borne disease to another, there likely will soon also

06:37.440 --> 06:42.880
be a Lyme disease vaccine. But this is less a medical miracle and more of a what-took-so-long

06:42.880 --> 06:47.360
story. Right at the intersection of climate change, mistrust of experts, and for-profit

06:47.360 --> 06:52.800
medicine sits Lyme disease. Because temperatures continue to rise, more of the US and Europe is

06:52.800 --> 06:58.160
hospitable for Lyme-toting ticks, and because of vaccine hesitancy in the 1990s, your dog can get

06:58.160 --> 07:03.920
a proactive shot, but you can't. Due to these factors, Lyme disease has doubled in the US since

07:03.920 --> 07:10.080
1991, and has become the most common vector-borne disease in the US. Relief, though, may be in sight

07:10.080 --> 07:15.600
as a vaccine entered final clinical trials this year. VLA-15, as the medicine is called,

07:15.600 --> 07:21.600
has been administered to 6,000 participants in the US and Europe. Perhaps, though, VLA-15 is

07:21.600 --> 07:27.200
more notable for what it isn't—Lymerics, which was once a publicly available Lyme vaccine.

07:27.200 --> 07:31.680
Lymerics had its problems—it required three doses, was only available to people older than

07:31.680 --> 07:38.560
15, and wasn't exactly cheap. Now the makers of VLA-15 are working hard to avoid these shortcomings.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.960
But what led to Lymerics being pulled from the market is ultimately something drug makers can't

07:42.960 --> 07:48.400
control—snowballing vaccine hesitancy. In the end, it was unsubstantiated but

07:48.400 --> 07:52.560
hypothetically possible claims that Lymerics could cause autoimmune disease that ended

07:52.560 --> 07:57.840
Lymerics in the late 90s. Since then, the disease has spread across the US and hesitancy over

07:57.840 --> 08:03.280
vaccines has dug deeper than ever, so quite a lot rides on this trial and the public's response to it.

08:04.880 --> 08:09.360
An expectation-laden trial of the sports world ended this year with a landmark labor agreement

08:09.360 --> 08:14.400
more than six years in the making. In 2016, the US women's national soccer team sued the

08:14.400 --> 08:19.040
US Soccer Federation for gender discrimination. Although their case was thrown out by a federal

08:19.040 --> 08:23.600
court in 2020, the dispute stretched on until their counterparts on the US men's national

08:23.600 --> 08:27.520
soccer team helped broker a payment deal this year—a first-of-its-kind strategy among the

08:27.520 --> 08:31.680
three organizations that sets the bar for international athletics. While the men's side

08:31.680 --> 08:36.320
gets paid more per win due to FIFA's pay structure, the women's side consistently performs better,

08:36.320 --> 08:41.840
having won the 2015 and 2019 World Cups and Olympic medals in 2016 and 2020, meaning they're

08:41.840 --> 08:46.160
more likely to get the grand prize for winning the cup. So, they've decided to pool their winnings and

08:46.160 --> 08:50.160
split them equally, which means all players will benefit from either team's advancement in

08:50.160 --> 08:54.640
tournaments. This solution demonstrates how sports teams can challenge sports leagues in equities and

08:54.640 --> 09:00.640
help their teams level up both on and off the field. Another measure that's driving equity

09:00.640 --> 09:05.200
comes on a plate. When COVID hit, the federal government passed an emergency act that provided

09:05.200 --> 09:09.680
free school-based breakfast and lunch for almost all students in America. This was a way to make

09:09.680 --> 09:13.840
sure kids were eating, even when their families weren't doing well financially, and getting full,

09:13.840 --> 09:19.280
nutritious meals, besides being a basic necessity, is linked to better grades and fewer absences.

09:19.280 --> 09:23.360
So, when congressional Republicans blocked a measure to keep the free meal waivers in place,

09:23.360 --> 09:27.680
California, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Connecticut took it upon themselves

09:27.680 --> 09:31.840
to continue the program. Colorado also just approved a ballot measure that makes free

09:31.840 --> 09:35.760
school lunch available to all, and at least five other states have introduced universal

09:35.760 --> 09:40.720
meals legislation. The idea is that by offering free meals, it destigmatizes the practice for

09:40.720 --> 09:45.120
those who depend on it and includes students who may not necessarily qualify for free or reduced

09:45.120 --> 09:49.920
lunch, but still need it. Roughly one in six children aren't getting enough to eat nationally,

09:49.920 --> 09:54.000
and getting to the point where it's a federally funded program for all students may be an uphill

09:54.000 --> 09:58.480
climb. But in the states where it's implemented, like California where nearly six million students

09:58.480 --> 10:03.760
benefit from the program, it's working. Like a lot of social issues, it has to start somewhere.

10:05.360 --> 10:10.240
A development we all may well benefit from in the near future started somewhere in Europe this year.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.720
That's because the European Parliament voted almost unanimously to adopt a universal charging

10:14.720 --> 10:20.240
port standard by 2024, agreeing upon USBC for portable devices. The initial announcement

10:20.240 --> 10:24.400
obviously made the world's number one tech company, Apple, a bit ruffle because it runs

10:24.400 --> 10:28.800
its iPhones on the proprietary Lightning cable, maintaining a corporate strategy that all things

10:28.800 --> 10:34.000
begin and end under it. But, they capitulated this time, and all iPhones will now make the

10:34.000 --> 10:39.840
transition to the USBC design, more commonly found on Android devices. Upon making the announcement,

10:39.840 --> 10:44.880
Apple's Greg Joswiak said the switch would affect one billion people worldwide. Not only does it

10:44.880 --> 10:49.840
streamline tech for the users, but it'll speed things up as the USBC cable transmits data quicker

10:49.840 --> 10:55.680
than Apple's Lightning cable. Additionally, standardizing ports will save $338 million in

10:55.680 --> 11:01.440
e-waste per year, according to one European report. So really, this is just good news for anyone with

11:01.440 --> 11:06.560
a phone. And in good news for anyone with a car, electric vehicle markets around the world have

11:06.560 --> 11:10.960
surpassed the so-called tipping point for electric vehicle adoption, with the United States hitting

11:10.960 --> 11:15.680
the threshold this year. According to the diffusion of innovation theory pioneered by communication

11:15.680 --> 11:20.080
theorist E.M. Rogers, the rate at which a new product becomes popular after entering the market

11:20.080 --> 11:25.280
looks like this—an S-curve. Sales initially comprise only a small share of people, known as

11:25.280 --> 11:29.520
the innovators and early adopters, and the innovation might still fizzle out. But once

11:29.520 --> 11:33.760
it reaches this critical inflection point, it is considered validated as an innovation,

11:33.760 --> 11:39.280
starts to enter the mainstream, and growth picks up rapidly. For EVs, the inflection point is

11:39.280 --> 11:44.240
generally accepted as 5% of total vehicle sales, so after countries hit this mark, there's a

11:44.240 --> 11:50.000
corresponding surge in popularity which means the US could soon see EV adoption spread even faster,

11:50.000 --> 11:55.040
especially considering the expanded EV tax credits authorized in the recent Inflation Reduction Act.

11:55.040 --> 12:00.240
With the addition of the US, 19 countries now have EV industries that comprise 5% or more of

12:00.240 --> 12:05.280
total vehicle purchases, also including the United Kingdom, Norway, South Korea, and Germany. In

12:05.280 --> 12:10.880
South Korea, EV sales have already increased to 21% of the market, while in Norway, they comprise

12:10.880 --> 12:18.480
over 83%. No one knows exactly how many orphaned oil and gas wells dot the US—they just know there

12:18.480 --> 12:24.160
are a lot, perhaps as many as 3 million, and that they're leaking methane, and a lot of it. Abandoned

12:24.160 --> 12:28.400
and incorrectly capped wells are bad for water quality through what they spew locally, and are

12:28.400 --> 12:32.720
devastating for the climate through the highly variable, sometimes extreme amount of greenhouse

12:32.720 --> 12:36.880
gases they release into the atmosphere. The good news is that they were considered in the

12:36.880 --> 12:42.400
Infrastructure Bill. The legislation earmarked $4.7 billion for identifying and capping these

12:42.400 --> 12:47.440
wells, which is the largest sum ever committed to legacy polluters. In August, the project

12:47.440 --> 12:52.400
officially began when the Department of the Interior released $560 million to 24 states

12:52.400 --> 12:57.120
to begin capping high-priority wells on private and public lands. Each state is approaching the

12:57.120 --> 13:02.240
project slightly differently. Some, like Ohio and New Mexico, are prioritizing work in disadvantaged

13:02.240 --> 13:07.200
communities. Others, like Arizona and Montana, are working to ensure that small businesses are

13:07.200 --> 13:12.240
awarded contracts to do the work. Regardless of approach, the process of identifying, measuring,

13:12.240 --> 13:16.240
and eventually filling the wells with concrete is labor-intensive and expensive to the point

13:16.240 --> 13:22.080
that Pennsylvania prices the capping of a single well at $33,000. But as an upside,

13:22.080 --> 13:26.720
this serves as an example as to how job creation can be built around curbing emissions.

13:26.720 --> 13:32.720
Another win for human health this year recognized the benefits of broadening access to nature for

13:32.720 --> 13:37.040
mental well-being. Spending at least two hours in nature per week is linked to reduced blood

13:37.040 --> 13:41.040
pressure and stress levels, as well as lowered anxiety and depression, according to studies

13:41.040 --> 13:45.360
published in Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And now,

13:45.360 --> 13:49.360
doctors in Canada can prescribe nature to their patients through the PARx program,

13:49.360 --> 13:53.840
which covers the cost of a park pass for patients who could benefit from more time spent in nature.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.880
Originally piloted in British Columbia by Dr. Melissa Lem,

13:56.880 --> 14:00.640
Canada has now broadened the program to include every province because of its success,

14:00.640 --> 14:05.680
as it can ease symptoms of health conditions ranging from ADHD to heart disease to diabetes.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.760
Canadians can now visit any of Canada's 80 national parks for free if their doctor

14:09.760 --> 14:13.840
prescribes it, and other governments, like the Weld County Health Department in Colorado,

14:13.840 --> 14:17.520
have followed suit to help more people access the healing power of nature.

14:18.400 --> 14:23.680
Mental health has also been top of mind at the Pentagon. Suicide is an intensely difficult

14:23.680 --> 14:27.920
problem to solve. As Secretary of the Army Christine Warmoth rightly put it,

14:27.920 --> 14:32.720
quote, one suicide is one too many. But the daunting challenge of eliminating suicide

14:32.720 --> 14:37.840
in the armed forces hasn't stopped military leaders from trying. In the second half of 2021,

14:37.840 --> 14:42.800
after an increase in suicides in 2020 compared to the year prior, the Army implemented a new

14:43.600 --> 14:49.360
suicide prevention policy for the fiscal year of 2022. Military wellness checks, suicide prevention

14:49.360 --> 14:53.200
teaching and training, new handbooks for senior commanders on mental health, and integrated

14:53.200 --> 14:57.280
prevention efforts aimed to create positive climates were some of the main tenets established

14:57.280 --> 15:01.760
in the comprehensive overhaul. While these practices in name border on military jargon,

15:01.760 --> 15:07.120
it's clear that the increased focus is working as active-duty Army suicides dropped 21% along

15:07.120 --> 15:12.480
with declines in family member and civilian staff suicides through the first three quarters of 2022.

15:12.480 --> 15:16.640
The effort goes beyond the Army too, as the Department of Defense has worked hard to counter

15:16.640 --> 15:20.560
dated assumptions concerning mental wellness and has begun the process of hiring an additional

15:20.560 --> 15:24.000
2,000 mental health personnel while continuing to develop strategies that

15:24.000 --> 15:29.680
de-stigmatize searching out help. Remember mRNA vaccine technology—the innovation

15:29.680 --> 15:33.600
that was successfully implemented for the first time in COVID-19 immunizations?

15:33.600 --> 15:39.120
Thanks to that, it's now being tested to protect against HIV, too. Unlike traditional vaccines,

15:39.120 --> 15:42.880
which inject a weakened virus into our bodies to trigger an immune response,

15:42.880 --> 15:47.280
messenger RNA is genetic material that tells our bodies how to make proteins.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.040
Researchers had been experimenting with it for years, but they went into overdrive to

15:51.040 --> 15:55.280
specifically create mRNA that teaches spike proteins how to ward off COVID.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.960
Now, the National Institutes of Health is running a series of trials to see if this

15:58.960 --> 16:03.920
same idea can be applied to HIV—a virus that has defied successful vaccines since the 1980s

16:03.920 --> 16:09.280
when it emerged, and has since killed more than 40 million people. If successful in this stage,

16:09.280 --> 16:13.760
the vaccine would then go on to efficiency trials, and cautiously optimistic scientists

16:13.760 --> 16:17.200
said there could be a promising inoculation within a couple of years.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.160
The pandemic caused art museum attendance and budgets to plummet,

16:22.160 --> 16:26.000
and one way institutions combated this was to sell art from their collections,

16:26.000 --> 16:30.720
aka deaccessioning it, to raise funds to pay for things like salaries and maintenance.

16:30.720 --> 16:35.120
The issue is that this practice was previously banned by the Association of Art Museum Directors,

16:35.120 --> 16:39.200
who argued that pieces should be kept in public collections, or that museums would sell off their

16:39.200 --> 16:43.520
most valuable pieces for the most profitable return. The board temporarily allowed it for

16:43.520 --> 16:48.240
two years during COVID, but like a lot of pandemic pivots, this one is sticking around.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.160
Recently, the same group voted to let museums sell their works to finance caring for their

16:52.160 --> 16:56.160
collections, with some serious guardrails, including restrictions that funds cannot pay

16:56.160 --> 17:00.800
for salaries, but have to go directly to the works themselves, such as buying acid-free paper,

17:00.800 --> 17:04.960
frames, and storage material. In the long run, however, it keeps museums open,

17:04.960 --> 17:07.280
and that's probably the biggest win for everyone.

17:09.280 --> 17:14.320
More efficient running was also the story for the world's fleet of motorized two-wheelers in 2022.

17:14.320 --> 17:19.200
More specifically, it was a great year for the Taiwanese battery company Gogoro. Gogoro

17:19.200 --> 17:23.760
built swappable batteries and charging stations for electric motorbikes across Taiwan, and in

17:23.760 --> 17:29.760
August they announced a major milestone—they had reached 500,000 subscribers to their swappable

17:29.760 --> 17:34.000
battery network. In September, they announced that their operation, which had already spread

17:34.000 --> 17:39.120
across all of Taiwan with 2,200 swap stations, was expanding into Israel and Singapore.

17:39.120 --> 17:44.160
While the conversation around EVs often revolves around cars, the arrival and expansion of

17:44.160 --> 17:48.480
swappable batteries and electric motorized two-wheelers is critically important in places

17:48.480 --> 17:53.200
like Southeast Asia, where around 80% of households own motorized bikes. Not only are

17:53.200 --> 17:58.000
these bikes incredibly numerous, they're notoriously dirty. The average two-stroke

17:58.000 --> 18:02.800
engine rickshaw emits the same amount of soot as ten Jeeps, making a transition to electric

18:02.800 --> 18:08.720
all the more exciting. Already, Gogoro by itself accounts for 25% of the new two-wheelers sold in

18:08.720 --> 18:14.080
Taiwan, while a host of other Asian manufacturers, like Honda, are looking to crack into the market.

18:14.080 --> 18:18.320
Though swappable batteries are yet to prove viable in cars, Gogoro's subscription service

18:18.320 --> 18:21.600
provides users an important alternative to power transportation.

18:23.280 --> 18:27.920
Major technology developments haven't been confined to roadways, either. Ethereum is one

18:27.920 --> 18:32.560
of the most important open-source blockchains in the world, and its native currency, Ether,

18:32.560 --> 18:37.520
has the second-largest market capitalization of any cryptocurrency. In other words,

18:37.520 --> 18:41.840
Ethereum's massive, so when it completely flipped its validation model in September,

18:41.840 --> 18:46.480
it was a big deal. Prior to the flip, Ethereum, like nearly all other blockchains,

18:46.480 --> 18:50.960
used the proof-of-work model, where miners and their powerful computers verify transactions

18:50.960 --> 18:55.520
and create blocks. But this year, Ethereum flipped to what is called the proof-of-stake model,

18:55.520 --> 18:59.760
which opens up the process of transaction verification and blockmaking to any potential

18:59.760 --> 19:04.800
validator willing to stake their own Ether as insurance. Now, the very reason crypto mining

19:04.800 --> 19:09.360
exists is to ensure transactional security and accuracy, and that's where the stake comes in.

19:09.360 --> 19:14.000
Should a transaction be incorrectly verified, then the penalty is taken out of the stake.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.440
Like all things crypto and blockchain, the mechanics of this flip are complicated,

19:17.440 --> 19:21.520
but this is a world-altering change as proof-of-stake opens the door for further

19:21.520 --> 19:27.600
decentralization and, most importantly, it slashes energy consumption by a shocking 99.95%.

19:28.400 --> 19:32.720
The transitions already prove nothing short of revolutionary as Ethereum's co-founder has

19:32.720 --> 19:36.320
stated that the merge has lowered the world's energy consumption by 0.2%,

19:36.960 --> 19:41.680
an incredible accomplishment that benefits everyone regardless of their thoughts on crypto.

19:42.240 --> 19:48.000
So, security for a different sort of product, this time baseball memorabilia, is probably an issue

19:48.000 --> 19:53.360
that you didn't know was an issue. Collecting things from baseball games, bats, balls, bases,

19:53.360 --> 19:57.520
is quite popular and lucrative in the industry, especially when they're used to set a record,

19:57.520 --> 20:02.880
like Aaron Judge's historic 62nd home run of the season this fall. Forgeries used to run rampant,

20:02.880 --> 20:07.600
with some estimates indicating that three-quarters of autographs were fake in the 1990s.

20:07.600 --> 20:12.640
The MLB and FBI set out to solve this problem, increasingly adding levels of authentication and

20:12.640 --> 20:17.840
protection, and 2022 was a year for the ultimate in standard setting. Once an item is played,

20:17.840 --> 20:23.280
so to speak, an authenticator stands as a witness and official signator. The item, let's say Judge's

20:23.280 --> 20:28.480
62nd home run ball, is then authenticated with an official MLB hologram, one that previously

20:28.480 --> 20:33.600
included a serial number. Now that special hologram is a security lockbox with a two-letter

20:33.600 --> 20:38.480
prefix, a serial number, a QR code, and a validation code all affixed to a tamper-proof

20:38.480 --> 20:43.280
hologram. That's all traceable back to its origins in a standard database which includes some 6

20:43.280 --> 20:47.760
million authenticated items to date. This is useful for everything from small nonprofit

20:47.760 --> 20:51.760
auctions to headline-making ones, such as for Judge's ball, which is reportedly up for more

20:51.760 --> 20:59.120
than $3 million. In ecologically useful news, this year marked the end of a 20-year long battle to

20:59.120 --> 21:03.520
demolish four dams on the lower Klamath River in southern Oregon and northern California that will

21:04.000 --> 21:08.960
the biggest river restoration project in US history. On November 17th, the Federal Energy

21:08.960 --> 21:12.800
Regulatory Commission authorized the demolition of these dams, which have cut off salmon from

21:12.800 --> 21:18.560
their annual patterns of migration for over a century. With over 400 miles or 640 kilometers

21:18.560 --> 21:23.840
of salmon spawning habitat gone, large populations have simply vanished—all because of these dams'

21:23.840 --> 21:28.880
dam presence. Salmon are a keystone species, and without healthy numbers of them swimming upstream,

21:28.880 --> 21:33.200
spawning the upper basin, and later dying there, the river's sediment became trapped behind dams

21:33.200 --> 21:38.080
and without the same levels of ecologically valuable fatty acids left behind by dead salmon.

21:38.080 --> 21:41.520
This amount created a rapid outgrowth of algae throughout the Klamath River,

21:41.520 --> 21:46.560
including ceratinova shasta, a strain that killed off 70% of juvenile salmon in 2020.

21:46.560 --> 21:51.280
And although these dams did provide hydroelectric power, they are no longer necessary for energy

21:51.280 --> 21:55.840
generation with new local wind power installations that have more than met the region's electric

21:55.840 --> 22:01.600
needs. So, here's to hoping that 2023 will be the year of Klamath River salmon finally returning

22:01.600 --> 22:06.880
home. Information flows freely on the internet, and one of the unmanaged wormholes on the web

22:06.880 --> 22:11.200
is deepfakes—digitally altered photos and videos of real people that are manipulated,

22:11.200 --> 22:14.800
typically to spread false information. Now, Intel announced they've developed a

22:14.800 --> 22:19.760
solution called FakeCatcher, which they claim can detect artificial videos with up to 96%

22:19.760 --> 22:24.480
accuracy in real time. The company's software scans the pixels in a video for slight changes

22:24.480 --> 22:28.800
in facial blood flow, detecting what's real about a video, and some other technologies that require

22:28.800 --> 22:32.800
raw data to be uploaded, then scan for inconsistencies that could be flagged as fake—a

22:32.800 --> 22:37.840
cumbersome and hours-long process. The program is hosted on a server and runs through a web-based

22:37.840 --> 22:42.240
platform, meaning it can easily be used by social media sites and news organizations—two of the

22:42.240 --> 22:46.560
biggest opportunity markets for technology like this, where lookalike videos run rampant.

22:48.480 --> 22:53.840
Perfluorical and polyfluorical substances, or PFAs, are complex human-made chemicals.

22:53.840 --> 22:58.640
They are both scary and hard to pronounce, so they are more commonly called forever chemicals.

22:58.640 --> 23:03.200
These unnatural creations just don't go away on their own—rather than degrade or dissipate,

23:03.200 --> 23:08.320
they stick around in our environment, in our water systems, and in our bodies pretty much forever.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.800
Originating in the 1930s and 40s, and made infamous by DuPont's Teflon plant poisoning

23:12.800 --> 23:15.840
the town of Parksburg, West Virginia for much of the second half of the century,

23:15.840 --> 23:19.920
PFAs have proved both extremely helpful for nonstick cooking, fire suppression,

23:19.920 --> 23:24.160
and countless manufacturing processes, while also extremely damaging to human health,

23:24.160 --> 23:27.520
leading to cancer, reproductive problems, and endocrine disruption.

23:27.520 --> 23:32.320
So, we've kept using them, kept getting sick from them, but haven't found a way to get rid of them.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.720
That was until this year when the long process of developing a cost-effective solution for

23:36.720 --> 23:40.800
breaking these chemical compounds down was published in the journal Science.

23:40.800 --> 23:45.760
It turns out the solutions… well, a solution, as scientist Brittany Trang found that mixing PFAs

23:45.760 --> 23:50.560
with the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSL, the chemicals sodium hydroxide, and water,

23:50.560 --> 23:55.200
then bringing the mix to a boil broke the dangerous compounds into harmless fragments.

23:55.200 --> 23:59.040
One application of this would be to treat drinking water, helping more than 2,000 American

23:59.040 --> 24:03.200
cities with PFA levels above the Environmental Protection Agency limit, according to one

24:03.200 --> 24:07.760
environmental advocacy group. While remarkably simple, the development is critically important

24:07.760 --> 24:12.640
in the fight to break these PFAs down as tens of thousands of tons of these chemicals are released

24:12.640 --> 24:20.480
into the environment every single year. The United States abolished slavery in 1865.

24:20.480 --> 24:26.320
Well, it abolished most slavery. For over 160 years, there's existed a single glaring

24:26.320 --> 24:32.000
exception in the 13th Amendment—that slavery was unconstitutional except as a punishment for crime,

24:32.000 --> 24:37.440
something that prisons have relied on ever since. This year, four states—Alabama, Oregon,

24:37.440 --> 24:41.680
Tennessee, and Vermont—closed this loophole to involuntary servitude with ballot measures that

24:41.680 --> 24:46.640
repealed the exception. In doing so, they joined Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, and Rhode Island in

24:46.640 --> 24:51.440
entirely nixing any form of slavery from their state constitutions. The issue also appeared on

24:51.440 --> 24:56.400
ballots in Louisiana during this year's midterms, where it failed. This failure, however, is less an

24:56.400 --> 25:01.280
indictment of the state, and more so a recognition of the importance of the exact language used.

25:01.280 --> 25:05.280
In Louisiana, some early proponents of the amendment actually decided to push against

25:05.280 --> 25:09.360
the bill as the wording had the potential to expand the use of involuntary labor in the state,

25:09.360 --> 25:13.840
while rank-and-file voters simply couldn't parse what the amendment's wording would actually change.

25:13.840 --> 25:19.280
Across the board, prison labor creates $2 billion a year in goods and provides $9 billion worth of

25:19.280 --> 25:24.160
facilities maintenance, while prison laborers, some 800,000 in number, make on average less than

25:24.160 --> 25:29.520
a dollar an hour and some don't make any money at all. While banning slavery ends in voluntary

25:29.520 --> 25:34.240
labor, prison labor still figures to be important for upkeep of facilities and a major cog in what

25:34.240 --> 25:39.680
keeps prisons running. Now, though, at very least, it is explicitly a matter of choice for prisoners

25:39.680 --> 25:45.200
to partake in seven states. The final breakthrough of 2022 could,

25:45.200 --> 25:50.160
when looked back on in the future, carry with it perhaps the most profound implications of them all,

25:50.160 --> 25:56.640
as this December, the US announced the biggest step towards virtually limitless green energy to date.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.720
The announcement came out of a much-anticipated Department of Energy press conference, while the

26:00.720 --> 26:06.000
breakthrough itself came in the form of nuclear fusion. Today, all nuclear power plants rely on

26:06.000 --> 26:10.720
fission—the splitting of atoms—to create energy, while fusion—the smashing together of atoms—has

26:10.720 --> 26:16.080
remained the unrealized, theoretically possible, but brutally difficult to actualize alternative.

26:16.080 --> 26:20.640
Unlike fission, fusion doesn't create nuclear waste. Also unlike fission, we haven't figured

26:20.640 --> 26:25.360
out how to effectively harness fusion. But we're getting closer. For the first time ever,

26:25.360 --> 26:30.080
an American lab produced more energy through fusion than what was used to create the reaction.

26:30.080 --> 26:34.400
Firing hydrogen-rich pellets into a series of high-powered lasers, scientists at the Lawrence

26:34.400 --> 26:38.320
Livermore National Laboratory were able to create explosions that gave off energy in the form of

26:38.320 --> 26:43.680
heat for a fraction of a second—enough energy to boil roughly 10 kettles of water. For a project

26:43.680 --> 26:48.480
that has cost somewhere near $3.5 billion, 10 kettles of water doesn't seem like much,

26:48.480 --> 26:52.720
but proving that ignition is possible is a critical step going forward.

26:52.720 --> 26:56.720
Next up is finding a way to maintain these reactions for longer than a fraction of a second,

26:56.720 --> 27:00.640
and while the development timeline is still likely too long for fission to prove a viable

27:00.640 --> 27:05.120
solution to the climate crisis, this represents an incredible milestone towards a future of

27:05.120 --> 27:10.800
low-cost, pollution-free energy abundance as yet confined to only the most imaginative science

27:10.800 --> 27:16.800
fiction. I had a minor, ultimately meaningless personal problem that I figured out a few years

27:16.800 --> 27:22.160
ago, so I want to talk to you about what I found as a solution. You see, I really enjoy the fun,

27:22.160 --> 27:27.200
calming process of putting on some music, maybe lighting a candle, and just making a home-cooked

27:27.200 --> 27:32.000
meal. The problem was, by the time I stopped by the grocery store, unloaded the car, gathered all

27:32.000 --> 27:36.560
the ingredients, prepped, cooked, and cleaned, it was almost time to go to sleep and my evening was

27:36.560 --> 27:41.200
basically gone. The only alternatives were to pay a huge amount for some lukewarm delivery food,

27:41.200 --> 27:46.400
or to microwave some frozen food that really wasn't good or healthy—until I found HelloFresh.

27:46.400 --> 27:50.720
This is all true—I started my subscription in 2020 just by researching what the best meal

27:50.720 --> 27:54.240
subscription box was—these are all the recipe cards that I've accumulated to prove it—and

27:54.240 --> 27:58.560
it was only a year and a half later that they came along and started sponsoring my channels.

27:58.560 --> 28:03.360
So, if you have this same problem of not having the time to but enjoying making home-cooked meals,

28:03.360 --> 28:08.960
then this is the solution that I actually found and kept using myself before I had any financial

28:08.960 --> 28:13.440
incentive to do so. Beyond the time-saving factor, research on HelloFresh has found that,

28:13.440 --> 28:18.880
on average, it works out to 25% cheaper and less caloric than takeout, and slightly cheaper than

28:18.880 --> 28:23.280
grocery shopping. But the most important thing is that it's just easier—everything comes in

28:23.280 --> 28:27.040
the exact quantities you need, with some ingredients already prepared, so you skip to

28:27.040 --> 28:31.600
the nice part of cooking, not the measuring and mixing. And the food's actually good, and usually

28:31.600 --> 28:35.840
more varied than cooking with grocery ingredients since you get to pick one of dozens of meals each

28:35.840 --> 28:39.920
week. So, if you want to solve this problem in your life, click the button on screen or
