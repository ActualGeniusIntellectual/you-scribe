0	6880	2022 was just another year. There was death, and there was destruction, and there was disease,
6880	12880	and there were wildfires, and hurricanes, and earthquakes, and drought, and poverty,
12880	18720	and pollution, and war, and terrorism, and habitat destruction, and rising temperatures,
18720	24240	and human rights violations, and dysfunctional political systems, and widening wealth inequality,
24240	29120	and worrisome leaps forward in AI, and steps towards the precipice of nuclear Armageddon,
29120	34800	and an ever-present inclination that the present degree of chaos truly is unprecedented.
35440	41680	These issues matter, but they're not the only things that matter. Through it all, the world
41680	46960	got better. Whether it balanced out to a net improvement is perhaps up for debate,
46960	53600	but the fact that things did get better is not. We are leaving 2022 without problems with which
53600	60880	we entered 2022. This matters. The world of the future is defined by the actions of today,
60880	65840	so just as much as we fight against and lament against the issues of today, we should celebrate
65840	72320	the successes that compound into a ceaseless inclined march of human progress. So, that's
72320	79440	what we'll do. For our final video of 2022, we'll cover 22 problems solved this year. Some mean
79440	84880	little in the grand scheme, others could define society within a few more trips around the sun.
84880	90880	Some were celebrated by few, others consumed our media for days. And some might not be accepted
90880	97280	by all, but none portray a meaningfully contested position as a solution. Rather, in the fine scrub
97280	102480	of it, they portray the democratic system as a potential process through which problems can
102480	109120	and do get solved. Like all else, solutions should be celebrated when and where they happen.
109200	115920	So, to start our story of 22 problems the world solved in 2022, let's start beyond it—in the
115920	122480	cosmic. In a perfect world, we'd solve potential problems before they materialized—we'd be
122480	128160	proactive. While this isn't a perfect world and we generally aren't proactive, we, or more accurately
128160	133360	NASA, did solve one potentially enormous problem well ahead of time with its Double Asteroid
133360	139440	Redirection Test, or DART. This September, after ten months since launch, the test accumulated in
139440	145200	a 1,300-pound or 600-kilogram spacecraft roughly the size of a refrigerator smashing head-on into
145200	150320	an asteroid called Dimorphis. Now, Dimorphis wasn't actually headed towards Earth—it was just
150320	155680	orbiting around another larger asteroid, Didymos, some seven to ten million miles away. Instead,
155680	160320	this was a test to see if ramming into an asteroid would knock it off its course—a concern of
160320	164800	existential proportion in the event that one beelines towards us in the near future.
164800	169600	Fortunately, the test was a success beyond expectations. After the collision, Dimorphis
169600	174240	was pushed about 500 feet closer to Didymos, shortening its orbit by 32 minutes which,
174240	177440	for NASA employees expecting a change in course around 10 to 20 minutes,
177440	182080	was a major proof of concept and a first success for their planetary defense strategy.
184160	188640	In existential news of the terrestrial variety, the United States agreed to join the Kigali
188640	192400	Amendment this year as part of the federal government's efforts to phase out the most
192400	197840	problematic carbon substances. This amendment follows the 1987 Montreal Protocol, a climate
197840	203440	treaty that phased out 100 types of ozone-depleting chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
203440	208720	which started destroying Earth's ozone layer. The problem was, manufacturers replaced CFCs with
208720	214320	hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which aren't great either. While the ozone hole did get smaller,
214400	220080	HFCs have a far worse greenhouse effect than CO2. Whereas carbon dioxide has a warming potential
220080	224640	of 1 based on its ability to trap heat, and methane has a warming potential of 34,
224640	231840	HFCs have warming potentials ranging from 1,370 to 4,180, which makes them way worse
231840	237040	for climate change. So, the Kigali Amendment expands on those original ozone-depleters to
237040	242640	phase out 100% of HFCs, which means manufacturers in the US and most of the rest of the world won't
242640	249600	be able to use these compounds at all by 2050. While HFCs are out as of this year,
249600	255040	comeback stories are in. In an age of massive biodiversity loss, it turns out that some animal
255040	260960	species are making dramatic recoveries. Across Europe, over 50 species are returning in record
260960	266240	numbers after reintroduction to expanded habitats across the continent. For example, the European
266240	271520	bison has made a spectacular comeback despite having been thought to be extinct in the 1920s.
271520	278560	Since 1971, their populations alone have increased by 399%, with reintroductions in Belarus,
278560	284480	Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine, and now the United Kingdom. The first
284480	289440	baby European bison born in the UK in thousands of years was introduced this summer in Kent,
289440	294080	where it can help reduce flood risk and restore a diverse ecosystem, which can help slow the effects
294080	298080	of climate change. And while this news doesn't cancel out the global mass extinction event
298080	302560	currently underway, it presents a roadmap to getting back to biodiverse and resilient
302560	307440	ecosystems. Turns out, when humans step back and give animals just a bit of breathing room,
307440	314320	they can return from the brink and even thrive. Another scientific advancement that helps life
314320	319760	thrive is the vaccine. In 2021, the first ever vaccine was approved by the World Health
319760	325120	Organization to prevent malaria. This year, researchers doubled down on the progress with
325120	329920	a huge breakthrough. Malaria is a mosquito-transmitted disease that kills more than a
329920	335120	half million people each year, making it the sixth leading cause of death in low-income countries,
335120	341440	mostly found in Africa. Nearly 80% of these deaths are children. It's an exceptionally large problem
341440	346240	for Africans especially, not only in lives lost, but also in terms of economic impacts due to
346240	351760	healthcare costs, absenteeism from work and school, reduced tourism, and lost workforce.
351760	356560	The good news is that increasingly, there's a solution. This new vaccine attacks the parasite
356560	360960	early in its infection by intercepting before entry into the liver, using a combination of
360960	366240	proteins from both malaria parasites and the hepatitis B virus. That's the key here. By using
366240	370800	more of the malaria protein, a University of Oxford team came up with a second vaccine that's
370800	375600	even more effective in clinical trials than the version released in 2021. Both still await the
375600	380480	result of a larger trial, but an Indian vaccine manufacturer is prepared to make more than 100
380480	385280	million doses once it's officially approved. Either way, the fact that there is now potential
385280	390640	options to fight malaria before its destructive symptoms start is truly a medical miracle that
390640	397440	will save millions of lives. From one vector-borne disease to another, there likely will soon also
397440	402880	be a Lyme disease vaccine. But this is less a medical miracle and more of a what-took-so-long
402880	407360	story. Right at the intersection of climate change, mistrust of experts, and for-profit
407360	412800	medicine sits Lyme disease. Because temperatures continue to rise, more of the US and Europe is
412800	418160	hospitable for Lyme-toting ticks, and because of vaccine hesitancy in the 1990s, your dog can get
418160	423920	a proactive shot, but you can't. Due to these factors, Lyme disease has doubled in the US since
423920	430080	1991, and has become the most common vector-borne disease in the US. Relief, though, may be in sight
430080	435600	as a vaccine entered final clinical trials this year. VLA-15, as the medicine is called,
435600	441600	has been administered to 6,000 participants in the US and Europe. Perhaps, though, VLA-15 is
441600	447200	more notable for what it isn't—Lymerics, which was once a publicly available Lyme vaccine.
447200	451680	Lymerics had its problems—it required three doses, was only available to people older than
451680	458560	15, and wasn't exactly cheap. Now the makers of VLA-15 are working hard to avoid these shortcomings.
458560	462960	But what led to Lymerics being pulled from the market is ultimately something drug makers can't
462960	468400	control—snowballing vaccine hesitancy. In the end, it was unsubstantiated but
468400	472560	hypothetically possible claims that Lymerics could cause autoimmune disease that ended
472560	477840	Lymerics in the late 90s. Since then, the disease has spread across the US and hesitancy over
477840	483280	vaccines has dug deeper than ever, so quite a lot rides on this trial and the public's response to it.
484880	489360	An expectation-laden trial of the sports world ended this year with a landmark labor agreement
489360	494400	more than six years in the making. In 2016, the US women's national soccer team sued the
494400	499040	US Soccer Federation for gender discrimination. Although their case was thrown out by a federal
499040	503600	court in 2020, the dispute stretched on until their counterparts on the US men's national
503600	507520	soccer team helped broker a payment deal this year—a first-of-its-kind strategy among the
507520	511680	three organizations that sets the bar for international athletics. While the men's side
511680	516320	gets paid more per win due to FIFA's pay structure, the women's side consistently performs better,
516320	521840	having won the 2015 and 2019 World Cups and Olympic medals in 2016 and 2020, meaning they're
521840	526160	more likely to get the grand prize for winning the cup. So, they've decided to pool their winnings and
526160	530160	split them equally, which means all players will benefit from either team's advancement in
530160	534640	tournaments. This solution demonstrates how sports teams can challenge sports leagues in equities and
534640	540640	help their teams level up both on and off the field. Another measure that's driving equity
540640	545200	comes on a plate. When COVID hit, the federal government passed an emergency act that provided
545200	549680	free school-based breakfast and lunch for almost all students in America. This was a way to make
549680	553840	sure kids were eating, even when their families weren't doing well financially, and getting full,
553840	559280	nutritious meals, besides being a basic necessity, is linked to better grades and fewer absences.
559280	563360	So, when congressional Republicans blocked a measure to keep the free meal waivers in place,
563360	567680	California, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Connecticut took it upon themselves
567680	571840	to continue the program. Colorado also just approved a ballot measure that makes free
571840	575760	school lunch available to all, and at least five other states have introduced universal
575760	580720	meals legislation. The idea is that by offering free meals, it destigmatizes the practice for
580720	585120	those who depend on it and includes students who may not necessarily qualify for free or reduced
585120	589920	lunch, but still need it. Roughly one in six children aren't getting enough to eat nationally,
589920	594000	and getting to the point where it's a federally funded program for all students may be an uphill
594000	598480	climb. But in the states where it's implemented, like California where nearly six million students
598480	603760	benefit from the program, it's working. Like a lot of social issues, it has to start somewhere.
605360	610240	A development we all may well benefit from in the near future started somewhere in Europe this year.
610240	614720	That's because the European Parliament voted almost unanimously to adopt a universal charging
614720	620240	port standard by 2024, agreeing upon USBC for portable devices. The initial announcement
620240	624400	obviously made the world's number one tech company, Apple, a bit ruffle because it runs
624400	628800	its iPhones on the proprietary Lightning cable, maintaining a corporate strategy that all things
628800	634000	begin and end under it. But, they capitulated this time, and all iPhones will now make the
634000	639840	transition to the USBC design, more commonly found on Android devices. Upon making the announcement,
639840	644880	Apple's Greg Joswiak said the switch would affect one billion people worldwide. Not only does it
644880	649840	streamline tech for the users, but it'll speed things up as the USBC cable transmits data quicker
649840	655680	than Apple's Lightning cable. Additionally, standardizing ports will save $338 million in
655680	661440	e-waste per year, according to one European report. So really, this is just good news for anyone with
661440	666560	a phone. And in good news for anyone with a car, electric vehicle markets around the world have
666560	670960	surpassed the so-called tipping point for electric vehicle adoption, with the United States hitting
670960	675680	the threshold this year. According to the diffusion of innovation theory pioneered by communication
675680	680080	theorist E.M. Rogers, the rate at which a new product becomes popular after entering the market
680080	685280	looks like this—an S-curve. Sales initially comprise only a small share of people, known as
685280	689520	the innovators and early adopters, and the innovation might still fizzle out. But once
689520	693760	it reaches this critical inflection point, it is considered validated as an innovation,
693760	699280	starts to enter the mainstream, and growth picks up rapidly. For EVs, the inflection point is
699280	704240	generally accepted as 5% of total vehicle sales, so after countries hit this mark, there's a
704240	710000	corresponding surge in popularity which means the US could soon see EV adoption spread even faster,
710000	715040	especially considering the expanded EV tax credits authorized in the recent Inflation Reduction Act.
715040	720240	With the addition of the US, 19 countries now have EV industries that comprise 5% or more of
720240	725280	total vehicle purchases, also including the United Kingdom, Norway, South Korea, and Germany. In
725280	730880	South Korea, EV sales have already increased to 21% of the market, while in Norway, they comprise
730880	738480	over 83%. No one knows exactly how many orphaned oil and gas wells dot the US—they just know there
738480	744160	are a lot, perhaps as many as 3 million, and that they're leaking methane, and a lot of it. Abandoned
744160	748400	and incorrectly capped wells are bad for water quality through what they spew locally, and are
748400	752720	devastating for the climate through the highly variable, sometimes extreme amount of greenhouse
752720	756880	gases they release into the atmosphere. The good news is that they were considered in the
756880	762400	Infrastructure Bill. The legislation earmarked $4.7 billion for identifying and capping these
762400	767440	wells, which is the largest sum ever committed to legacy polluters. In August, the project
767440	772400	officially began when the Department of the Interior released $560 million to 24 states
772400	777120	to begin capping high-priority wells on private and public lands. Each state is approaching the
777120	782240	project slightly differently. Some, like Ohio and New Mexico, are prioritizing work in disadvantaged
782240	787200	communities. Others, like Arizona and Montana, are working to ensure that small businesses are
787200	792240	awarded contracts to do the work. Regardless of approach, the process of identifying, measuring,
792240	796240	and eventually filling the wells with concrete is labor-intensive and expensive to the point
796240	802080	that Pennsylvania prices the capping of a single well at $33,000. But as an upside,
802080	806720	this serves as an example as to how job creation can be built around curbing emissions.
806720	812720	Another win for human health this year recognized the benefits of broadening access to nature for
812720	817040	mental well-being. Spending at least two hours in nature per week is linked to reduced blood
817040	821040	pressure and stress levels, as well as lowered anxiety and depression, according to studies
821040	825360	published in Nature and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And now,
825360	829360	doctors in Canada can prescribe nature to their patients through the PARx program,
829360	833840	which covers the cost of a park pass for patients who could benefit from more time spent in nature.
833840	836880	Originally piloted in British Columbia by Dr. Melissa Lem,
836880	840640	Canada has now broadened the program to include every province because of its success,
840640	845680	as it can ease symptoms of health conditions ranging from ADHD to heart disease to diabetes.
845680	849760	Canadians can now visit any of Canada's 80 national parks for free if their doctor
849760	853840	prescribes it, and other governments, like the Weld County Health Department in Colorado,
853840	857520	have followed suit to help more people access the healing power of nature.
858400	863680	Mental health has also been top of mind at the Pentagon. Suicide is an intensely difficult
863680	867920	problem to solve. As Secretary of the Army Christine Warmoth rightly put it,
867920	872720	quote, one suicide is one too many. But the daunting challenge of eliminating suicide
872720	877840	in the armed forces hasn't stopped military leaders from trying. In the second half of 2021,
877840	882800	after an increase in suicides in 2020 compared to the year prior, the Army implemented a new
883600	889360	suicide prevention policy for the fiscal year of 2022. Military wellness checks, suicide prevention
889360	893200	teaching and training, new handbooks for senior commanders on mental health, and integrated
893200	897280	prevention efforts aimed to create positive climates were some of the main tenets established
897280	901760	in the comprehensive overhaul. While these practices in name border on military jargon,
901760	907120	it's clear that the increased focus is working as active-duty Army suicides dropped 21% along
907120	912480	with declines in family member and civilian staff suicides through the first three quarters of 2022.
912480	916640	The effort goes beyond the Army too, as the Department of Defense has worked hard to counter
916640	920560	dated assumptions concerning mental wellness and has begun the process of hiring an additional
920560	924000	2,000 mental health personnel while continuing to develop strategies that
924000	929680	de-stigmatize searching out help. Remember mRNA vaccine technology—the innovation
929680	933600	that was successfully implemented for the first time in COVID-19 immunizations?
933600	939120	Thanks to that, it's now being tested to protect against HIV, too. Unlike traditional vaccines,
939120	942880	which inject a weakened virus into our bodies to trigger an immune response,
942880	947280	messenger RNA is genetic material that tells our bodies how to make proteins.
947280	951040	Researchers had been experimenting with it for years, but they went into overdrive to
951040	955280	specifically create mRNA that teaches spike proteins how to ward off COVID.
955280	958960	Now, the National Institutes of Health is running a series of trials to see if this
958960	963920	same idea can be applied to HIV—a virus that has defied successful vaccines since the 1980s
963920	969280	when it emerged, and has since killed more than 40 million people. If successful in this stage,
969280	973760	the vaccine would then go on to efficiency trials, and cautiously optimistic scientists
973760	977200	said there could be a promising inoculation within a couple of years.
978800	982160	The pandemic caused art museum attendance and budgets to plummet,
982160	986000	and one way institutions combated this was to sell art from their collections,
986000	990720	aka deaccessioning it, to raise funds to pay for things like salaries and maintenance.
990720	995120	The issue is that this practice was previously banned by the Association of Art Museum Directors,
995120	999200	who argued that pieces should be kept in public collections, or that museums would sell off their
999200	1003520	most valuable pieces for the most profitable return. The board temporarily allowed it for
1003520	1008240	two years during COVID, but like a lot of pandemic pivots, this one is sticking around.
1008240	1012160	Recently, the same group voted to let museums sell their works to finance caring for their
1012160	1016160	collections, with some serious guardrails, including restrictions that funds cannot pay
1016160	1020800	for salaries, but have to go directly to the works themselves, such as buying acid-free paper,
1020800	1024960	frames, and storage material. In the long run, however, it keeps museums open,
1024960	1027280	and that's probably the biggest win for everyone.
1029280	1034320	More efficient running was also the story for the world's fleet of motorized two-wheelers in 2022.
1034320	1039200	More specifically, it was a great year for the Taiwanese battery company Gogoro. Gogoro
1039200	1043760	built swappable batteries and charging stations for electric motorbikes across Taiwan, and in
1043760	1049760	August they announced a major milestone—they had reached 500,000 subscribers to their swappable
1049760	1054000	battery network. In September, they announced that their operation, which had already spread
1054000	1059120	across all of Taiwan with 2,200 swap stations, was expanding into Israel and Singapore.
1059120	1064160	While the conversation around EVs often revolves around cars, the arrival and expansion of
1064160	1068480	swappable batteries and electric motorized two-wheelers is critically important in places
1068480	1073200	like Southeast Asia, where around 80% of households own motorized bikes. Not only are
1073200	1078000	these bikes incredibly numerous, they're notoriously dirty. The average two-stroke
1078000	1082800	engine rickshaw emits the same amount of soot as ten Jeeps, making a transition to electric
1082800	1088720	all the more exciting. Already, Gogoro by itself accounts for 25% of the new two-wheelers sold in
1088720	1094080	Taiwan, while a host of other Asian manufacturers, like Honda, are looking to crack into the market.
1094080	1098320	Though swappable batteries are yet to prove viable in cars, Gogoro's subscription service
1098320	1101600	provides users an important alternative to power transportation.
1103280	1107920	Major technology developments haven't been confined to roadways, either. Ethereum is one
1107920	1112560	of the most important open-source blockchains in the world, and its native currency, Ether,
1112560	1117520	has the second-largest market capitalization of any cryptocurrency. In other words,
1117520	1121840	Ethereum's massive, so when it completely flipped its validation model in September,
1121840	1126480	it was a big deal. Prior to the flip, Ethereum, like nearly all other blockchains,
1126480	1130960	used the proof-of-work model, where miners and their powerful computers verify transactions
1130960	1135520	and create blocks. But this year, Ethereum flipped to what is called the proof-of-stake model,
1135520	1139760	which opens up the process of transaction verification and blockmaking to any potential
1139760	1144800	validator willing to stake their own Ether as insurance. Now, the very reason crypto mining
1144800	1149360	exists is to ensure transactional security and accuracy, and that's where the stake comes in.
1149360	1154000	Should a transaction be incorrectly verified, then the penalty is taken out of the stake.
1154000	1157440	Like all things crypto and blockchain, the mechanics of this flip are complicated,
1157440	1161520	but this is a world-altering change as proof-of-stake opens the door for further
1161520	1167600	decentralization and, most importantly, it slashes energy consumption by a shocking 99.95%.
1168400	1172720	The transitions already prove nothing short of revolutionary as Ethereum's co-founder has
1172720	1176320	stated that the merge has lowered the world's energy consumption by 0.2%,
1176960	1181680	an incredible accomplishment that benefits everyone regardless of their thoughts on crypto.
1182240	1188000	So, security for a different sort of product, this time baseball memorabilia, is probably an issue
1188000	1193360	that you didn't know was an issue. Collecting things from baseball games, bats, balls, bases,
1193360	1197520	is quite popular and lucrative in the industry, especially when they're used to set a record,
1197520	1202880	like Aaron Judge's historic 62nd home run of the season this fall. Forgeries used to run rampant,
1202880	1207600	with some estimates indicating that three-quarters of autographs were fake in the 1990s.
1207600	1212640	The MLB and FBI set out to solve this problem, increasingly adding levels of authentication and
1212640	1217840	protection, and 2022 was a year for the ultimate in standard setting. Once an item is played,
1217840	1223280	so to speak, an authenticator stands as a witness and official signator. The item, let's say Judge's
1223280	1228480	62nd home run ball, is then authenticated with an official MLB hologram, one that previously
1228480	1233600	included a serial number. Now that special hologram is a security lockbox with a two-letter
1233600	1238480	prefix, a serial number, a QR code, and a validation code all affixed to a tamper-proof
1238480	1243280	hologram. That's all traceable back to its origins in a standard database which includes some 6
1243280	1247760	million authenticated items to date. This is useful for everything from small nonprofit
1247760	1251760	auctions to headline-making ones, such as for Judge's ball, which is reportedly up for more
1251760	1259120	than $3 million. In ecologically useful news, this year marked the end of a 20-year long battle to
1259120	1263520	demolish four dams on the lower Klamath River in southern Oregon and northern California that will
1264000	1268960	the biggest river restoration project in US history. On November 17th, the Federal Energy
1268960	1272800	Regulatory Commission authorized the demolition of these dams, which have cut off salmon from
1272800	1278560	their annual patterns of migration for over a century. With over 400 miles or 640 kilometers
1278560	1283840	of salmon spawning habitat gone, large populations have simply vanished—all because of these dams'
1283840	1288880	dam presence. Salmon are a keystone species, and without healthy numbers of them swimming upstream,
1288880	1293200	spawning the upper basin, and later dying there, the river's sediment became trapped behind dams
1293200	1298080	and without the same levels of ecologically valuable fatty acids left behind by dead salmon.
1298080	1301520	This amount created a rapid outgrowth of algae throughout the Klamath River,
1301520	1306560	including ceratinova shasta, a strain that killed off 70% of juvenile salmon in 2020.
1306560	1311280	And although these dams did provide hydroelectric power, they are no longer necessary for energy
1311280	1315840	generation with new local wind power installations that have more than met the region's electric
1315840	1321600	needs. So, here's to hoping that 2023 will be the year of Klamath River salmon finally returning
1321600	1326880	home. Information flows freely on the internet, and one of the unmanaged wormholes on the web
1326880	1331200	is deepfakes—digitally altered photos and videos of real people that are manipulated,
1331200	1334800	typically to spread false information. Now, Intel announced they've developed a
1334800	1339760	solution called FakeCatcher, which they claim can detect artificial videos with up to 96%
1339760	1344480	accuracy in real time. The company's software scans the pixels in a video for slight changes
1344480	1348800	in facial blood flow, detecting what's real about a video, and some other technologies that require
1348800	1352800	raw data to be uploaded, then scan for inconsistencies that could be flagged as fake—a
1352800	1357840	cumbersome and hours-long process. The program is hosted on a server and runs through a web-based
1357840	1362240	platform, meaning it can easily be used by social media sites and news organizations—two of the
1362240	1366560	biggest opportunity markets for technology like this, where lookalike videos run rampant.
1368480	1373840	Perfluorical and polyfluorical substances, or PFAs, are complex human-made chemicals.
1373840	1378640	They are both scary and hard to pronounce, so they are more commonly called forever chemicals.
1378640	1383200	These unnatural creations just don't go away on their own—rather than degrade or dissipate,
1383200	1388320	they stick around in our environment, in our water systems, and in our bodies pretty much forever.
1388320	1392800	Originating in the 1930s and 40s, and made infamous by DuPont's Teflon plant poisoning
1392800	1395840	the town of Parksburg, West Virginia for much of the second half of the century,
1395840	1399920	PFAs have proved both extremely helpful for nonstick cooking, fire suppression,
1399920	1404160	and countless manufacturing processes, while also extremely damaging to human health,
1404160	1407520	leading to cancer, reproductive problems, and endocrine disruption.
1407520	1412320	So, we've kept using them, kept getting sick from them, but haven't found a way to get rid of them.
1412320	1416720	That was until this year when the long process of developing a cost-effective solution for
1416720	1420800	breaking these chemical compounds down was published in the journal Science.
1420800	1425760	It turns out the solutions… well, a solution, as scientist Brittany Trang found that mixing PFAs
1425760	1430560	with the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSL, the chemicals sodium hydroxide, and water,
1430560	1435200	then bringing the mix to a boil broke the dangerous compounds into harmless fragments.
1435200	1439040	One application of this would be to treat drinking water, helping more than 2,000 American
1439040	1443200	cities with PFA levels above the Environmental Protection Agency limit, according to one
1443200	1447760	environmental advocacy group. While remarkably simple, the development is critically important
1447760	1452640	in the fight to break these PFAs down as tens of thousands of tons of these chemicals are released
1452640	1460480	into the environment every single year. The United States abolished slavery in 1865.
1460480	1466320	Well, it abolished most slavery. For over 160 years, there's existed a single glaring
1466320	1472000	exception in the 13th Amendment—that slavery was unconstitutional except as a punishment for crime,
1472000	1477440	something that prisons have relied on ever since. This year, four states—Alabama, Oregon,
1477440	1481680	Tennessee, and Vermont—closed this loophole to involuntary servitude with ballot measures that
1481680	1486640	repealed the exception. In doing so, they joined Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, and Rhode Island in
1486640	1491440	entirely nixing any form of slavery from their state constitutions. The issue also appeared on
1491440	1496400	ballots in Louisiana during this year's midterms, where it failed. This failure, however, is less an
1496400	1501280	indictment of the state, and more so a recognition of the importance of the exact language used.
1501280	1505280	In Louisiana, some early proponents of the amendment actually decided to push against
1505280	1509360	the bill as the wording had the potential to expand the use of involuntary labor in the state,
1509360	1513840	while rank-and-file voters simply couldn't parse what the amendment's wording would actually change.
1513840	1519280	Across the board, prison labor creates $2 billion a year in goods and provides $9 billion worth of
1519280	1524160	facilities maintenance, while prison laborers, some 800,000 in number, make on average less than
1524160	1529520	a dollar an hour and some don't make any money at all. While banning slavery ends in voluntary
1529520	1534240	labor, prison labor still figures to be important for upkeep of facilities and a major cog in what
1534240	1539680	keeps prisons running. Now, though, at very least, it is explicitly a matter of choice for prisoners
1539680	1545200	to partake in seven states. The final breakthrough of 2022 could,
1545200	1550160	when looked back on in the future, carry with it perhaps the most profound implications of them all,
1550160	1556640	as this December, the US announced the biggest step towards virtually limitless green energy to date.
1556640	1560720	The announcement came out of a much-anticipated Department of Energy press conference, while the
1560720	1566000	breakthrough itself came in the form of nuclear fusion. Today, all nuclear power plants rely on
1566000	1570720	fission—the splitting of atoms—to create energy, while fusion—the smashing together of atoms—has
1570720	1576080	remained the unrealized, theoretically possible, but brutally difficult to actualize alternative.
1576080	1580640	Unlike fission, fusion doesn't create nuclear waste. Also unlike fission, we haven't figured
1580640	1585360	out how to effectively harness fusion. But we're getting closer. For the first time ever,
1585360	1590080	an American lab produced more energy through fusion than what was used to create the reaction.
1590080	1594400	Firing hydrogen-rich pellets into a series of high-powered lasers, scientists at the Lawrence
1594400	1598320	Livermore National Laboratory were able to create explosions that gave off energy in the form of
1598320	1603680	heat for a fraction of a second—enough energy to boil roughly 10 kettles of water. For a project
1603680	1608480	that has cost somewhere near $3.5 billion, 10 kettles of water doesn't seem like much,
1608480	1612720	but proving that ignition is possible is a critical step going forward.
1612720	1616720	Next up is finding a way to maintain these reactions for longer than a fraction of a second,
1616720	1620640	and while the development timeline is still likely too long for fission to prove a viable
1620640	1625120	solution to the climate crisis, this represents an incredible milestone towards a future of
1625120	1630800	low-cost, pollution-free energy abundance as yet confined to only the most imaginative science
1630800	1636800	fiction. I had a minor, ultimately meaningless personal problem that I figured out a few years
1636800	1642160	ago, so I want to talk to you about what I found as a solution. You see, I really enjoy the fun,
1642160	1647200	calming process of putting on some music, maybe lighting a candle, and just making a home-cooked
1647200	1652000	meal. The problem was, by the time I stopped by the grocery store, unloaded the car, gathered all
1652000	1656560	the ingredients, prepped, cooked, and cleaned, it was almost time to go to sleep and my evening was
1656560	1661200	basically gone. The only alternatives were to pay a huge amount for some lukewarm delivery food,
1661200	1666400	or to microwave some frozen food that really wasn't good or healthy—until I found HelloFresh.
1666400	1670720	This is all true—I started my subscription in 2020 just by researching what the best meal
1670720	1674240	subscription box was—these are all the recipe cards that I've accumulated to prove it—and
1674240	1678560	it was only a year and a half later that they came along and started sponsoring my channels.
1678560	1683360	So, if you have this same problem of not having the time to but enjoying making home-cooked meals,
1683360	1688960	then this is the solution that I actually found and kept using myself before I had any financial
1688960	1693440	incentive to do so. Beyond the time-saving factor, research on HelloFresh has found that,
1693440	1698880	on average, it works out to 25% cheaper and less caloric than takeout, and slightly cheaper than
1698880	1703280	grocery shopping. But the most important thing is that it's just easier—everything comes in
1703280	1707040	the exact quantities you need, with some ingredients already prepared, so you skip to
1707040	1711600	the nice part of cooking, not the measuring and mixing. And the food's actually good, and usually
1711600	1715840	more varied than cooking with grocery ingredients since you get to pick one of dozens of meals each
1715840	1719920	week. So, if you want to solve this problem in your life, click the button on screen or
1719920	1730720	go to HelloFresh.com and use code WENDOVER21 for 21 free meals plus free shipping.
