WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.460
The beginnings were as inadvertent as they come.

00:03.460 --> 00:08.140
Hastily drawn up and jammed into the entirely unrelated Safe Port Act, the Unlawful Internet

00:08.140 --> 00:13.020
Gambling Enforcement Act passed through Congress in September of 2006, then, with President

00:13.020 --> 00:16.280
Bush's signature a month later, became law.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.020
The unremarkable bit of legislation banned gambling companies from taking payments over

00:20.020 --> 00:23.420
the internet made in violation of state or federal law.

00:23.420 --> 00:27.700
The old guard of online gambling—the likes of Full Tilt Poker, Poker Stars, and Absolute

00:27.700 --> 00:31.280
Poker—the new law would prove an existential threat.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.460
For a set of upstarts, though, it'd function as the legal foundation of an as-yet untapped

00:36.460 --> 00:37.460
market.

00:37.460 --> 00:42.260
In trying to close one loophole, the Act opened another with this seemingly innocuous exemption—that

00:42.260 --> 00:47.220
betting and wagering did not include participation in fantasy sports, which were deemed as games

00:47.220 --> 00:48.860
of scale, not chance.

00:48.860 --> 00:54.020
At the time, the distinction made sense—fantasy sports were fundamentally different from any

00:54.020 --> 00:55.940
sort of online gambling.

00:55.940 --> 01:00.320
People didn't get rich off fantasy sports, nor did they lose thousands, tens of thousands,

01:00.320 --> 01:03.720
or hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fell swoop.

01:03.720 --> 01:07.100
Fantasy team owners wagered on season-long outcomes with their friends from school or

01:07.100 --> 01:10.740
work, and poured over stat sheets for bragging rights as much as money.

01:10.740 --> 01:13.620
They might have been obsessed, but they were never quite addicted.

01:13.620 --> 01:19.580
Then, in 2009, a fateful backyard brainstorm at South by Southwest completely altered the

01:19.580 --> 01:24.740
trajectory of fantasy sports and, as it would turn out, sports betting.

01:24.740 --> 01:29.020
The company that coalesced under the Austin sun was called FanDuel, and it was everything

01:29.020 --> 01:31.100
that fantasy wasn't.

01:31.100 --> 01:35.780
Countering the traditional season-long league, FanDuel offered daily fantasy.

01:35.780 --> 01:39.100
Rather than just playing with your buddies, the service provided tournaments and cash

01:39.100 --> 01:42.060
games to compete against countless others.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.920
Whereas traditional fantasy leagues only saw minimal financial exchanges in league buy-ins

01:45.920 --> 01:49.780
and annual draft guides, FanDuel moved major money.

01:49.780 --> 01:54.940
Just one good day they advertised could net a couple thousand dollars, and, thanks to

01:54.940 --> 02:00.480
the Unlawful Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, it was online and in your pocket.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.860
What had been slow-moving and cumbersome was now fast and convenient—just play from your

02:04.860 --> 02:09.320
phone, win, and cash out that very same day.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.020
Young people followed, and so too did money.

02:12.020 --> 02:18.380
FanDuel's first rounds of funding topped $1 million, then $4 million, then, by 2013,

02:18.380 --> 02:19.920
$11 million.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.620
As investment climbed, so too did winnings.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.660
That same year, the platform crowned its first million-dollar prize winner during its December

02:26.660 --> 02:31.860
Fantasy Football Championship and dished out more than $150 million in prize money overall.

02:31.860 --> 02:36.380
The following year, FanDuel partnered with the NBA, while its rising competitor, Draftkings,

02:36.380 --> 02:38.420
nabbed the MLB and NHL.

02:38.420 --> 02:42.940
Suddenly, companies that didn't exist just years prior were outspending the entire beer

02:42.940 --> 02:46.780
industry, running ads every 90 seconds on national TV.

02:46.780 --> 02:50.820
With palm-of-your-hand convenience, cheap buy-ins, mouthwatering prize potential, and

02:50.820 --> 02:56.020
unavoidable promotional offers, daily fantasy services had maximized the potential of fantasy

02:56.020 --> 02:57.020
sports.

02:57.020 --> 03:00.740
Sports fans played, sports leagues and media invested, while critics and academics began

03:00.740 --> 03:05.380
asking exactly to what extent this sped-up, further gamified version of fantasy sports

03:05.380 --> 03:07.940
actually differed from sports betting.

03:07.940 --> 03:13.600
Yet, rather than regulators intervening, legislators, league leaders, team owners, and daily fantasy

03:13.600 --> 03:18.200
consumers alike began to rethink just how bad sports betting really was.

03:18.200 --> 03:23.000
Banned by Congress in every state except Nevada, and opposed by all major leagues, sports betting

03:23.000 --> 03:26.720
had long been perceived as the antithesis of fair sport.

03:26.720 --> 03:31.080
This wasn't only the position held by league commissioners, either, as 56% of Americans

03:31.080 --> 03:35.080
polled in 1993 disapproved of its legalization.

03:35.080 --> 03:39.700
Through the 2000s, after point-shaving scandals rocked college basketball, then insider betting

03:39.700 --> 03:44.460
and the NBA came to light, betting remained a dark, shady sports underworld in the view

03:44.460 --> 03:48.720
of most and, to league leaders, a direct threat.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.820
Even through 2012, NFL's Roger Goodell, MLB's Bud Selig, NHL's Gary Bettman, and

03:53.820 --> 03:59.260
NCAA's Mark Emmert each came out against the idea of overturning the federal ban.

03:59.260 --> 04:02.420
Or at least that's what they said outwardly.

04:02.420 --> 04:06.340
As teams and leagues entered partnerships with gambling-adjacent fantasy platforms,

04:06.340 --> 04:10.980
internal conversations slowly shifted from sports betting as a scourge to sports betting

04:10.980 --> 04:13.200
as a potential opportunity.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.580
Daily fantasy drove more fan engagement, and so too would sports betting.

04:17.580 --> 04:21.880
At the same time, sports fans were voting with their wallets, as the American Gaming

04:21.880 --> 04:27.380
Association estimated that Americans were spending about $150 billion on wagers annually,

04:27.380 --> 04:31.140
with only a small fraction actually going through legal means in Nevada.

04:31.140 --> 04:34.540
Then finally, the head of the NBA came out and said it.

04:34.580 --> 04:38.940
If Americans were spending billions on sports bets, American newspapers and media were publishing

04:38.940 --> 04:43.700
betting lines, and other countries were finding success in regulating nationwide gambling,

04:43.700 --> 04:46.460
then why not just legalize it?

04:46.460 --> 04:52.180
By and large, the public followed the logic, as 2017 polling showed that 55% of Americans

04:52.180 --> 04:57.820
had now come to favor the idea of legalized regulated gambling, while only 33% opposed

04:57.820 --> 04:58.820
it.

04:58.820 --> 05:01.860
Polling, though, doesn't overturn federal bans.

05:01.860 --> 05:03.740
But the timing was perfect.

05:03.940 --> 05:08.940
While daily fantasy shot skyward, and American opinion came around, the legality of the federal

05:08.940 --> 05:10.860
ban was coming under question.

05:10.860 --> 05:14.900
New Jersey's effort to legalize sports betting to prop up a faltering Atlantic city had climbed

05:14.900 --> 05:20.820
all the way to the Supreme Court, and in 2018, a surprise ruling opened the floodgates as

05:20.820 --> 05:24.700
Justice Alito delivered the 7 to 2 opinion acknowledging that while sports gambling is

05:24.700 --> 05:28.940
fraught with controversy, it ultimately wasn't the federal government's constitutional right

05:28.940 --> 05:33.900
to ban it—rather, that it was the choice of each individual state.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.100
The race was on.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.820
Eight states legalized sports betting in 2018.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.300
Ten more joined in 2019.

05:40.300 --> 05:44.540
Sportsbooks opened in state and tribal casinos, sports venues added betting kiosks, while

05:44.540 --> 05:49.340
DraftKings and FanDuel, the darlings of daily fantasy, opened up brick and mortar lounges

05:49.340 --> 05:53.740
across the US and launched mobile online betting in states that allowed it.

05:53.740 --> 05:57.180
But this race to legalize wasn't between states.

05:57.180 --> 06:01.020
This was a time trial to see which gambling industry representatives could secure legalization

06:01.020 --> 06:04.300
as quickly as possible in the friendliest terms possible.

06:04.300 --> 06:08.460
The likes of FanDuel and DraftKings, who had previously spent millions ensuring that state

06:08.460 --> 06:13.180
legislators saw daily fantasy as a game of skill and not of luck, the strategy was already

06:13.180 --> 06:16.120
established and the team already assembled.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.660
From Trenton to Tallahassee to Topeka, lobbyists bought lawmakers gifts and presented the plot

06:20.660 --> 06:24.300
points of a new path over expensive glasses of wine.

06:24.300 --> 06:28.460
The best sports betting they pitched would bring tax revenue by the millions, and besides,

06:28.460 --> 06:32.200
they argued, people were betting illegally anyway—why not bring it above board, bring

06:32.200 --> 06:34.340
in revenue, and create a win-win?

06:34.340 --> 06:38.480
Or what about a win-win-win, they'd ask, where regulations and taxes are slightly less

06:38.480 --> 06:42.920
burdensome so more sportsbooks are incentivized to enter the market, so more users have more

06:42.920 --> 06:46.900
outlets to bet, so more volume brings the state more tax revenue?

06:46.900 --> 06:51.340
The pressure was immense as the deep pockets of the world's most recognizable casinos

06:51.340 --> 06:56.060
spared no expense in helping state legislators see the issue from their point of view.

06:56.060 --> 07:00.940
While the extent varied from state to state, the blitz was largely a success.

07:00.940 --> 07:07.780
By 2022, 30 US states and Washington DC had some form of legal and active sports betting.

07:07.780 --> 07:12.420
And this wasn't the sports betting of old—this was sports betting in the digital age.

07:12.420 --> 07:16.560
Sure, like before, people bet on the individual outcome of the game they were going to to

07:16.560 --> 07:20.220
heighten the experience, they put future bets down on whether or not the teams would match

07:20.220 --> 07:24.340
the win totals that their sportsbook projected, and wagered on odds for end-of-season awards

07:24.340 --> 07:27.880
and champions, but now they bet on far more, too.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.700
Odds not for games but for halves and quarters, propositional bets that didn't have to do

07:31.700 --> 07:35.900
with the outcome of the game like player points or shots on goals, and in-game parlays that

07:35.900 --> 07:40.160
combine propositional bets with score outcomes to boost potential payouts.

07:40.160 --> 07:44.360
Just as mobile devices turned fantasy games from four-month seasons to daily games, mobile

07:44.360 --> 07:47.940
gaming apps unlocked in-game betting that people could wager on in the middle of the

07:47.940 --> 07:50.740
sporting event they were watching on TV.

07:50.740 --> 07:54.920
People had more options and easier access than ever before, and the established gaming

07:54.920 --> 07:57.060
houses of Vegas took note.

07:57.060 --> 08:01.100
Joining FanDuel and DraftKings were online sportsbooks by familiar names like BetMGM,

08:01.100 --> 08:05.500
Caesars, WinBet, and Penn National Gaming's Barstool Sportsbook, while various other casinos

08:05.500 --> 08:08.740
and companies launched smaller, more regional online outfits.

08:08.740 --> 08:13.100
In 2019, US betting revenue doubled that of 2018.

08:13.100 --> 08:18.440
Then 2020, despite sports as an entity disappearing globally for a matter of months, saw revenue

08:18.440 --> 08:25.920
nearly double once again, then in 2021, revenue tripled to over $4.3 billion a year.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.580
Simply put, sports betting just exploded.

08:28.580 --> 08:32.660
Or at least, it looked like it exploded.

08:32.660 --> 08:37.920
It looked like an unmitigated force of nature, perhaps triggered by humans, but hardly managed

08:37.920 --> 08:38.920
by them.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.780
But that's what the industry wanted it to look like.

08:41.780 --> 08:46.140
To support the plot that they had laid out to legislators prior to legalization, they

08:46.140 --> 08:50.100
wanted it to look like this was only natural—that there was always a huge volume of betting

08:50.100 --> 08:54.380
behind closed doors and that sector growth merely represented this phenomenon moving

08:54.380 --> 08:57.420
into the legal space where it could be taxed and regulated.

08:57.420 --> 09:00.060
Well that was undoubtedly part of it.

09:00.060 --> 09:05.100
A huge additional chunk of this growth was precipitated by a carefully choreographed,

09:05.100 --> 09:10.180
long-planned deluge of spending and effort by the burgeoning industry—a well-funded

09:10.180 --> 09:14.460
scramble for market share before a hierarchy could set in.

09:14.460 --> 09:20.140
They knew that if the industry looked anything less than unstoppable, it could be stopped.

09:20.140 --> 09:25.020
Step one was to normalize the practice, and for this, the industry was gifted a massive

09:25.020 --> 09:28.600
opportunity—the COVID-19 pandemic.

09:28.600 --> 09:33.220
With the world of sports reopening into a new, less physical, less social context, the

09:33.220 --> 09:38.100
industry realized it could capitalize on the degraded fan experience to effectively manufacture

09:38.100 --> 09:39.620
a new normal.

09:40.060 --> 09:46.660
COVID was slowly and steadily growing pre-pandemic, but come Q3 2020, as the NHL, NBA, and MLB

09:46.660 --> 09:51.260
restarted their seasons in various forms of biosecure bubbles, the industry spent three

09:51.260 --> 09:55.340
times more than any prior quarter on TV advertising.

09:55.340 --> 09:58.260
And logos went everywhere.

09:58.260 --> 10:02.360
FanDuel adorned the boards around the NHL's pandemic-proof rink in Edmonton, on screens

10:02.360 --> 10:05.740
sitting where the NBA's courtside seats would normally go, on the pitcher's mound

10:05.740 --> 10:10.780
at MLB ballparks, and anywhere else where a competitor hadn't already inked a deal.

10:10.780 --> 10:14.780
With the knowledge that their most promising customer demographic was 18- to 35-year-old

10:14.780 --> 10:18.780
men, based on their above-average propensity to develop long-term, potentially addictive

10:18.780 --> 10:24.200
gambling habits, companies even inked deals with LSU, Michigan State University, CU Boulder,

10:24.200 --> 10:28.780
and other colleges to advertise sports betting to their own students—sometimes, as a New

10:28.780 --> 10:33.840
York Times investigation exposed, to the extent of paying a fixed amount per sign-up.

10:33.840 --> 10:37.880
This sports betting omnipresence wasn't normal, but it was tough for anyone to recognize

10:37.880 --> 10:40.160
that when nothing was.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.300
But making the practice feel as integral to the sports viewing experience as donning a

10:44.300 --> 10:48.440
jersey or assembling some nachos was only half the battle.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.160
Once the gambling companies got people in, they had to keep them—they had to turn a

10:52.160 --> 10:56.800
sign-up into a habit, and for that, there were inducements.

10:56.800 --> 11:00.460
The concept is loosely based on the casino experience.

11:00.460 --> 11:06.500
In Vegas, around 40% of gambling is conducted by the top 5% of gamblers—the high rollers—so

11:06.500 --> 11:11.060
the casinos generally focus their inherently limited resources on keeping these gamblers

11:11.060 --> 11:12.060
gambling.

11:12.060 --> 11:16.740
Typically, that task falls onto the casino hosts—they're supposed to act as the high

11:16.740 --> 11:20.980
rollers' friend, accompanying them to dinners, arranging show tickets, grabbing drinks from

11:20.980 --> 11:25.740
the bar, booking free flights, really doing anything they can to make the guests' experience

11:25.740 --> 11:26.740
better.

11:26.740 --> 11:31.660
What their job really is is to use that social dynamic, and the power to occasionally reimburse

11:31.660 --> 11:37.340
some losses, to subtly nudge the high roller towards playing more and betting bigger.

11:37.340 --> 11:41.300
The opportunity with online sports betting was that this task could be automated and

11:41.300 --> 11:46.540
extended to all, no matter if they bet $1 or $1 million.

11:46.540 --> 11:50.080
For example, if an algorithm predicts that a player is likely to stop betting after a

11:50.080 --> 11:56.220
string of losses, which some can with remarkable accuracy, it'll automatically offer a risk-free

11:56.220 --> 11:59.820
bet—if they lose the next one, they'll get their money back.

11:59.820 --> 12:04.660
But, the terms will indicate, the money returned can't be withdrawn—it has to be spent

12:04.660 --> 12:06.160
on another bet.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.700
After two additional bets, there's every chance the player wins one and decides to

12:09.700 --> 12:14.060
keep going, but even if they don't, they've gotten back into the groove of it so, even

12:14.060 --> 12:18.140
given the high cost of this inducement, the economics work out in aggregate so that free

12:18.140 --> 12:21.160
bets are a winning proposition for the gambling companies.

12:21.160 --> 12:25.740
The systems are just incredibly effective at forming a habit in their players in a cost-effective

12:26.260 --> 12:27.260
manner.

12:27.260 --> 12:31.580
Unsurprisingly, myriad academic research has demonstrated that inducements have a dramatic

12:31.580 --> 12:35.620
effect on the size of bets, and encourages the behavior that turns gambling from a form

12:35.620 --> 12:38.380
of entertainment into a problem.

12:38.380 --> 12:40.460
Governments know this, and yet they allow this.

12:40.460 --> 12:45.680
In fact, not only are inducements legal, but in many states, thanks to aggressive lobbying,

12:45.680 --> 12:50.200
they are tax-exempt, meaning sports betting companies have avoided paying millions upon

12:50.200 --> 12:55.420
millions of dollars in taxes by engaging in the practice that develops addicts.

12:55.420 --> 12:59.820
Underfunded and overstretched, state regulatory agencies have been unable to properly manage

12:59.820 --> 13:03.980
the sports betting companies, and their corresponding legislators have overwhelmingly failed to

13:03.980 --> 13:09.140
resist the influence of some of America's highest-paid and most effective lobbyists.

13:09.140 --> 13:13.260
While everyone in the equation hides it as best as possible, the gambling industry is

13:13.260 --> 13:18.780
in charge—they're calling the shots, and America is slowly and quietly turning into

13:18.780 --> 13:21.740
a nation of gamblers.

13:21.740 --> 13:24.760
This is far from unprecedented.

13:24.760 --> 13:28.520
On the other side of the equator, one of the US's closest cultural equivalents has

13:28.520 --> 13:35.720
already marched far further down this path—Australia is already a nation of gamblers.

13:35.720 --> 13:40.720
It is as deeply intertwined into society as guns are to America's.

13:40.720 --> 13:45.400
No population loses more to gambling than Australia's—each adult resident averages

13:45.400 --> 13:51.800
over $1,000 a year in loss, a clean doubling of America's equivalent figure—and the

13:51.800 --> 13:55.440
explanation is concerningly straightforward.

13:55.440 --> 13:59.040
In the US, casinos are a destination.

13:59.040 --> 14:03.280
From the center of New York City, the closest proper one is a 50-minute trek into Queens.

14:03.280 --> 14:07.360
From Dallas, it's an 80-minute drive north to Chickasaw land in Oklahoma.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.680
From San Francisco, it's a similar 60-minute drive north into Sonoma County.

14:11.680 --> 14:16.160
In Australia, however, casinos are city-center attractions.

14:16.160 --> 14:20.280
Melbourne's Crown Casino development sits just across from the city's central business

14:20.280 --> 14:24.920
district and has turned the riverfront into a lively nightlife destination that just happens

14:24.920 --> 14:27.960
to include a place to play poker, roulette, or craps.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.720
Sydney's newest tallest skyscraper now sits just steps away from the very location where

14:32.720 --> 14:37.360
the first fleet of European settlers started their colony and acts as the home to another

14:37.360 --> 14:39.360
Crown Casino development.

14:39.360 --> 14:43.520
And up in Brisbane, a slice of its city center was torn down and is now being rebuilt into

14:43.520 --> 14:47.720
the largest casino development in the country, which will tower over and look down upon the

14:47.720 --> 14:50.020
historic neighborhood below.

14:50.020 --> 14:54.180
Even Las Vegas separates the bulk of its casinos away from the city center.

14:54.180 --> 14:57.100
In Australia, they're tough to avoid.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.700
Gambling doesn't have to be purposefully planned.

14:59.700 --> 15:04.320
It can simply be spontaneous—a convenient, accessible way to turn one's day around

15:04.320 --> 15:07.100
for the better, or more often, worse.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.860
But the concerning convenience compounds.

15:10.860 --> 15:18.060
Across the country, nestled in a sizable proportion of bars and clubs, sit 188,000 slot machines,

15:18.060 --> 15:20.380
or pokies, as the locals would call them.

15:20.380 --> 15:24.580
That's one for every 137 residents.

15:24.580 --> 15:29.020
They are simply everywhere, but they're especially in the areas that use them the

15:29.020 --> 15:33.260
most, which more often than not are low-income neighborhoods.

15:33.260 --> 15:37.940
In Sydney, for example, adult residents of the upscale Ritzy Coringa area only lost an

15:37.940 --> 15:41.100
average of $180 a year to the pokies.

15:41.100 --> 15:46.860
Meanwhile, to the west, in Fairfield, overwhelmingly home to low-income immigrant families, the

15:46.860 --> 15:53.540
average adult lost nearly ten times as much—$1,558 a year.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.780
And this pattern extends city and country-wide.

15:56.780 --> 16:01.260
The lower the average income, the higher the average annual gambling loss.

16:01.260 --> 16:07.140
From a systematic perspective, gambling in Australia is acting as a wealth transfer mechanism

16:07.140 --> 16:11.860
from lower-income individuals to wealthy gambling conglomerate owners, and this has crafted

16:11.860 --> 16:15.780
a legitimate, nationwide public health crisis.

16:15.780 --> 16:21.720
Roughly one of every 14 Australians have exhibited signs of problematic gambling behavior.

16:21.720 --> 16:26.100
The government says this, the government knows this, and yet the government enables this

16:26.100 --> 16:29.660
because the gambling companies are in control.

16:29.660 --> 16:33.420
The methods used to exert their influence are neither unique nor interesting—it's

16:33.420 --> 16:37.580
the same lobbying, political donations, and revolving door between industry and politics

16:37.580 --> 16:39.780
that you see in America and beyond.

16:39.780 --> 16:44.680
It's just its extent and effectiveness that sets Australia apart.

16:44.680 --> 16:48.520
As many observers have put it, the gambling industry is Australia's equivalent of the

16:48.520 --> 16:50.640
American gun lobby.

16:50.640 --> 16:56.560
But there is still one final step in the gambling industry's grand plan.

16:56.560 --> 17:00.020
People gamble more when it's convenient—we know that people play more when they live

17:00.020 --> 17:04.040
closer to pokey machines, we know that people sports bet more when they can do so on their

17:04.040 --> 17:08.060
phones, and so the gambling industry knows what their biggest legislative win to date

17:08.060 --> 17:09.060
would be—iGaming.

17:09.060 --> 17:15.060
That's the technical term for the broad-bucket of chance-based gambling, roulette, slots,

17:15.060 --> 17:19.080
bingo, and more, taking place on the internet or apps.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.380
This would create a problem.

17:21.380 --> 17:26.980
Time and time and time again, a causal relationship has been demonstrated between accessibility

17:26.980 --> 17:31.620
of gambling and the likelihood of it developing into a problem, so the legalization of iGaming

17:31.620 --> 17:35.700
would undoubtedly increase the number of addicts.

17:35.700 --> 17:40.300
Drinking can be safe and fun, just like alcohol can be safe and fun.

17:40.300 --> 17:44.200
Consumed in the right amounts, in the right places, by the right people, there is no problem

17:44.200 --> 17:45.200
with drinking.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.660
Done in the right amounts, in the right places, by the right people, there doesn't have

17:48.660 --> 17:49.980
to be a problem with gambling.

17:49.980 --> 17:56.340
But in both cases, improper use can wreak havoc on life and livelihood.

17:56.340 --> 18:01.780
And increasingly in America, legal gambling is occurring improperly.

18:01.780 --> 18:05.900
Gambling has to be a destination, not a convenience.

18:05.900 --> 18:11.340
Anyone can have a terrible, hopeless day, log onto an app, wager far more than is responsible,

18:11.340 --> 18:16.020
lose it in an instant, and trigger a downward spiral of issues that turns a bad day into

18:16.020 --> 18:17.660
a bad year.

18:17.660 --> 18:22.460
Far fewer people can have a bad day, drive 80 minutes north to Oklahoma, and still think

18:22.460 --> 18:25.500
it's a good idea to wager an excessive amount.

18:25.500 --> 18:30.580
Putting such potential pain in people's pockets requires a degree of personal responsibility

18:30.580 --> 18:36.340
that few players are able to consistently fulfill across the full spectrum of emotions.

18:36.340 --> 18:41.940
Right now, on average, across the US, the power balance swings towards gambling companies

18:41.940 --> 18:44.300
rather than the regulators.

18:44.300 --> 18:49.200
Underfunded and overworked state regulators are struggling to cope with the massive, well-funded

18:49.200 --> 18:55.340
explosion in online gambling, and so regulation of existing rules is inconsistent and weak.

18:55.340 --> 18:59.420
Gambling companies feel this, and it means they consistently operate off of forgiveness,

18:59.420 --> 19:01.000
rather than permission.

19:01.000 --> 19:05.700
Gambling companies need to be terrified of regulators to keep the industry safe.

19:05.700 --> 19:10.180
Notably, Nevada's Gaming Commission has a death grip on Las Vegas casinos, holding

19:10.180 --> 19:14.520
them to an exceptionally high standard, leading to gambling companies often operating above

19:14.520 --> 19:17.300
those standards to allow for margin of error.

19:17.300 --> 19:22.340
But in the rest of the US, those very same companies and more consistently skirt, bend,

19:22.340 --> 19:26.740
and push the rules because they know they can get away with it—they downplay the risk

19:26.740 --> 19:30.740
of loss in advertising, even when that's illegal, they allow gamblers to accumulate

19:30.740 --> 19:34.660
credit card debt through deposits, even when that's illegal, they operate sports betting

19:34.660 --> 19:38.940
on lower-division semi-professional leagues, even when that's illegal, and more often

19:38.940 --> 19:42.960
than not, they're just told to do better in the future.

19:42.960 --> 19:47.460
Sports betting doesn't have to be a problem—it can be what it's portrayed as, it can be

19:47.460 --> 19:52.180
a fun, social way of upping the emotional stakes of the viewing experience—but far

19:52.180 --> 19:55.340
too often, it fails to hit the mark.

19:55.340 --> 19:59.660
Faced with few roadblocks and increasingly capable of knocking the remaining ones down,

19:59.660 --> 20:04.820
the industry is doing what industry does—finding and following the greatest possible revenue

20:04.820 --> 20:09.900
opportunity by turning the US into a nation of addicts.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.700
The trend is worrying, and it is a trend.

20:12.700 --> 20:16.740
West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Michigan all have

20:16.740 --> 20:22.600
legalized some form of iGaming, and more states are expected to follow in 2023.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.840
The dominoes are falling, the slow, silent march continues, and the gambling industry

20:26.840 --> 20:33.120
takes another step forward in its grand plan to consume America and Americans alike.

20:33.120 --> 20:38.480
Okay, so I'm really weirdly excited for this ad read because it's been an incredibly

20:38.480 --> 20:39.880
long time coming.

20:39.880 --> 20:43.240
Six months ago I made a video called the carbon offset problem, where the conclusion was that

20:43.240 --> 20:48.120
while carbon offsets as a concept can theoretically work, the current marketplace for them enables

20:48.120 --> 20:51.840
and even incentivizes scams to the point where they're nothing more than a greenwashing

20:51.840 --> 20:52.840
tool on average.

20:52.840 --> 20:57.000
The video got a ton of attention, and was even included in a John Oliver segment about

20:57.000 --> 21:00.760
the same subject, and then a little later the people at a company called Wren reached

21:00.760 --> 21:04.520
out and claimed they had created a system to help make offsets actually work.

21:04.520 --> 21:08.680
I talked with their CEO Landon, their project evaluator Sophie, and a few others over there

21:08.680 --> 21:12.200
for over an hour, and they walked me through the process and responded really well to all

21:12.200 --> 21:16.840
my grilling, and I left pretty confident that Wren is as good as it gets in the carbon offsetting

21:16.840 --> 21:17.840
market.

21:17.840 --> 21:21.460
As you might remember from my video, offsetting is only as good as the accuracy of project

21:21.460 --> 21:26.340
evaluation, so their project evaluator Sophie showed me the hundreds of tiny, tiny details

21:26.340 --> 21:30.060
that she individually verifies to make sure a project is actually going to do what it

21:30.060 --> 21:34.100
says it will, and it's an ongoing process once the project actually starts, too.

21:34.100 --> 21:38.400
They only have seven active projects so they put a ton of focus into each, but one thing

21:38.400 --> 21:42.500
I think is really smart is they only sell offsets in a combined portfolio of all of

21:42.500 --> 21:46.940
these—that way they reduce risk and build in a margin for error if one project falls

21:46.940 --> 21:47.940
short.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.180
In addition, unlike single project offsets, they can use the fund to help finance more

21:51.180 --> 21:55.240
experimental or ancillary projects that still help fight the climate crisis but are tougher

21:55.240 --> 21:56.860
to quantify in tons of carbon.

21:56.860 --> 22:00.520
For example, they recently added Carbon 180 to the mix, where they're helping this policy

22:00.520 --> 22:04.340
group that advocates and works for more funding for offset projects, which hopefully leads

22:04.340 --> 22:05.940
to a compounding effect.

22:05.940 --> 22:09.180
I could go on and on about all the different tiny ways they assure what they're doing

22:09.180 --> 22:13.180
actually works, but the thing to know is that, based on what I know about their subject,

22:13.180 --> 22:16.540
Wren is the real deal and if you're still skeptical you should check out their website

22:16.540 --> 22:18.780
because they do a good job of explaining how.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.900
So, if you want to be genuinely as sure as possible that you actually offset emissions

22:22.900 --> 22:25.780
from taking a flight, for example, they're the place to go.

22:25.780 --> 22:29.360
I've turned down plenty of carbon offsetting sponsors in the past, and I've opened myself

22:29.360 --> 22:32.800
up to plenty of criticism by doing this since I've been such a vocal critic of the carbon

22:32.800 --> 22:35.820
offsetting market, so you can know that I genuinely believe in them.

22:35.820 --> 22:39.900
They'll be what I use going forward both for my personal and business carbon offsetting,

22:39.900 --> 22:43.480
and I think you should too—they make it super simple to calculate your personal carbon

22:43.480 --> 22:46.500
footprint and give personalized suggestions on how to reduce it.

22:46.500 --> 22:50.220
Then, for anything else, you can set up a monthly offset so you can reduce your personal

22:50.220 --> 22:52.380
contribution to the climate crisis.

22:52.380 --> 22:55.700
Doing this probably costs a lot less than you think, and it's even less considering

22:55.700 --> 22:59.020
that if you click the button on screen or head to our link in the description, they'll

22:59.020 --> 23:02.940
pay to offset the first month of emissions for the first 100 people to sign up.
