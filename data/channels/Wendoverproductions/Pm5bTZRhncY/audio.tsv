0	3460	The beginnings were as inadvertent as they come.
3460	8140	Hastily drawn up and jammed into the entirely unrelated Safe Port Act, the Unlawful Internet
8140	13020	Gambling Enforcement Act passed through Congress in September of 2006, then, with President
13020	16280	Bush's signature a month later, became law.
16280	20020	The unremarkable bit of legislation banned gambling companies from taking payments over
20020	23420	the internet made in violation of state or federal law.
23420	27700	The old guard of online gambling—the likes of Full Tilt Poker, Poker Stars, and Absolute
27700	31280	Poker—the new law would prove an existential threat.
31280	36460	For a set of upstarts, though, it'd function as the legal foundation of an as-yet untapped
36460	37460	market.
37460	42260	In trying to close one loophole, the Act opened another with this seemingly innocuous exemption—that
42260	47220	betting and wagering did not include participation in fantasy sports, which were deemed as games
47220	48860	of scale, not chance.
48860	54020	At the time, the distinction made sense—fantasy sports were fundamentally different from any
54020	55940	sort of online gambling.
55940	60320	People didn't get rich off fantasy sports, nor did they lose thousands, tens of thousands,
60320	63720	or hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fell swoop.
63720	67100	Fantasy team owners wagered on season-long outcomes with their friends from school or
67100	70740	work, and poured over stat sheets for bragging rights as much as money.
70740	73620	They might have been obsessed, but they were never quite addicted.
73620	79580	Then, in 2009, a fateful backyard brainstorm at South by Southwest completely altered the
79580	84740	trajectory of fantasy sports and, as it would turn out, sports betting.
84740	89020	The company that coalesced under the Austin sun was called FanDuel, and it was everything
89020	91100	that fantasy wasn't.
91100	95780	Countering the traditional season-long league, FanDuel offered daily fantasy.
95780	99100	Rather than just playing with your buddies, the service provided tournaments and cash
99100	102060	games to compete against countless others.
102060	105920	Whereas traditional fantasy leagues only saw minimal financial exchanges in league buy-ins
105920	109780	and annual draft guides, FanDuel moved major money.
109780	114940	Just one good day they advertised could net a couple thousand dollars, and, thanks to
114940	120480	the Unlawful Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, it was online and in your pocket.
120480	124860	What had been slow-moving and cumbersome was now fast and convenient—just play from your
124860	129320	phone, win, and cash out that very same day.
129320	132020	Young people followed, and so too did money.
132020	138380	FanDuel's first rounds of funding topped $1 million, then $4 million, then, by 2013,
138380	139920	$11 million.
139920	142620	As investment climbed, so too did winnings.
142620	146660	That same year, the platform crowned its first million-dollar prize winner during its December
146660	151860	Fantasy Football Championship and dished out more than $150 million in prize money overall.
151860	156380	The following year, FanDuel partnered with the NBA, while its rising competitor, Draftkings,
156380	158420	nabbed the MLB and NHL.
158420	162940	Suddenly, companies that didn't exist just years prior were outspending the entire beer
162940	166780	industry, running ads every 90 seconds on national TV.
166780	170820	With palm-of-your-hand convenience, cheap buy-ins, mouthwatering prize potential, and
170820	176020	unavoidable promotional offers, daily fantasy services had maximized the potential of fantasy
176020	177020	sports.
177020	180740	Sports fans played, sports leagues and media invested, while critics and academics began
180740	185380	asking exactly to what extent this sped-up, further gamified version of fantasy sports
185380	187940	actually differed from sports betting.
187940	193600	Yet, rather than regulators intervening, legislators, league leaders, team owners, and daily fantasy
193600	198200	consumers alike began to rethink just how bad sports betting really was.
198200	203000	Banned by Congress in every state except Nevada, and opposed by all major leagues, sports betting
203000	206720	had long been perceived as the antithesis of fair sport.
206720	211080	This wasn't only the position held by league commissioners, either, as 56% of Americans
211080	215080	polled in 1993 disapproved of its legalization.
215080	219700	Through the 2000s, after point-shaving scandals rocked college basketball, then insider betting
219700	224460	and the NBA came to light, betting remained a dark, shady sports underworld in the view
224460	228720	of most and, to league leaders, a direct threat.
228720	233820	Even through 2012, NFL's Roger Goodell, MLB's Bud Selig, NHL's Gary Bettman, and
233820	239260	NCAA's Mark Emmert each came out against the idea of overturning the federal ban.
239260	242420	Or at least that's what they said outwardly.
242420	246340	As teams and leagues entered partnerships with gambling-adjacent fantasy platforms,
246340	250980	internal conversations slowly shifted from sports betting as a scourge to sports betting
250980	253200	as a potential opportunity.
253200	257580	Daily fantasy drove more fan engagement, and so too would sports betting.
257580	261880	At the same time, sports fans were voting with their wallets, as the American Gaming
261880	267380	Association estimated that Americans were spending about $150 billion on wagers annually,
267380	271140	with only a small fraction actually going through legal means in Nevada.
271140	274540	Then finally, the head of the NBA came out and said it.
274580	278940	If Americans were spending billions on sports bets, American newspapers and media were publishing
278940	283700	betting lines, and other countries were finding success in regulating nationwide gambling,
283700	286460	then why not just legalize it?
286460	292180	By and large, the public followed the logic, as 2017 polling showed that 55% of Americans
292180	297820	had now come to favor the idea of legalized regulated gambling, while only 33% opposed
297820	298820	it.
298820	301860	Polling, though, doesn't overturn federal bans.
301860	303740	But the timing was perfect.
303940	308940	While daily fantasy shot skyward, and American opinion came around, the legality of the federal
308940	310860	ban was coming under question.
310860	314900	New Jersey's effort to legalize sports betting to prop up a faltering Atlantic city had climbed
314900	320820	all the way to the Supreme Court, and in 2018, a surprise ruling opened the floodgates as
320820	324700	Justice Alito delivered the 7 to 2 opinion acknowledging that while sports gambling is
324700	328940	fraught with controversy, it ultimately wasn't the federal government's constitutional right
328940	333900	to ban it—rather, that it was the choice of each individual state.
333900	335100	The race was on.
335100	337820	Eight states legalized sports betting in 2018.
337820	340300	Ten more joined in 2019.
340300	344540	Sportsbooks opened in state and tribal casinos, sports venues added betting kiosks, while
344540	349340	DraftKings and FanDuel, the darlings of daily fantasy, opened up brick and mortar lounges
349340	353740	across the US and launched mobile online betting in states that allowed it.
353740	357180	But this race to legalize wasn't between states.
357180	361020	This was a time trial to see which gambling industry representatives could secure legalization
361020	364300	as quickly as possible in the friendliest terms possible.
364300	368460	The likes of FanDuel and DraftKings, who had previously spent millions ensuring that state
368460	373180	legislators saw daily fantasy as a game of skill and not of luck, the strategy was already
373180	376120	established and the team already assembled.
376120	380660	From Trenton to Tallahassee to Topeka, lobbyists bought lawmakers gifts and presented the plot
380660	384300	points of a new path over expensive glasses of wine.
384300	388460	The best sports betting they pitched would bring tax revenue by the millions, and besides,
388460	392200	they argued, people were betting illegally anyway—why not bring it above board, bring
392200	394340	in revenue, and create a win-win?
394340	398480	Or what about a win-win-win, they'd ask, where regulations and taxes are slightly less
398480	402920	burdensome so more sportsbooks are incentivized to enter the market, so more users have more
402920	406900	outlets to bet, so more volume brings the state more tax revenue?
406900	411340	The pressure was immense as the deep pockets of the world's most recognizable casinos
411340	416060	spared no expense in helping state legislators see the issue from their point of view.
416060	420940	While the extent varied from state to state, the blitz was largely a success.
420940	427780	By 2022, 30 US states and Washington DC had some form of legal and active sports betting.
427780	432420	And this wasn't the sports betting of old—this was sports betting in the digital age.
432420	436560	Sure, like before, people bet on the individual outcome of the game they were going to to
436560	440220	heighten the experience, they put future bets down on whether or not the teams would match
440220	444340	the win totals that their sportsbook projected, and wagered on odds for end-of-season awards
444340	447880	and champions, but now they bet on far more, too.
447880	451700	Odds not for games but for halves and quarters, propositional bets that didn't have to do
451700	455900	with the outcome of the game like player points or shots on goals, and in-game parlays that
455900	460160	combine propositional bets with score outcomes to boost potential payouts.
460160	464360	Just as mobile devices turned fantasy games from four-month seasons to daily games, mobile
464360	467940	gaming apps unlocked in-game betting that people could wager on in the middle of the
467940	470740	sporting event they were watching on TV.
470740	474920	People had more options and easier access than ever before, and the established gaming
474920	477060	houses of Vegas took note.
477060	481100	Joining FanDuel and DraftKings were online sportsbooks by familiar names like BetMGM,
481100	485500	Caesars, WinBet, and Penn National Gaming's Barstool Sportsbook, while various other casinos
485500	488740	and companies launched smaller, more regional online outfits.
488740	493100	In 2019, US betting revenue doubled that of 2018.
493100	498440	Then 2020, despite sports as an entity disappearing globally for a matter of months, saw revenue
498440	505920	nearly double once again, then in 2021, revenue tripled to over $4.3 billion a year.
505920	508580	Simply put, sports betting just exploded.
508580	512660	Or at least, it looked like it exploded.
512660	517920	It looked like an unmitigated force of nature, perhaps triggered by humans, but hardly managed
517920	518920	by them.
518920	521780	But that's what the industry wanted it to look like.
521780	526140	To support the plot that they had laid out to legislators prior to legalization, they
526140	530100	wanted it to look like this was only natural—that there was always a huge volume of betting
530100	534380	behind closed doors and that sector growth merely represented this phenomenon moving
534380	537420	into the legal space where it could be taxed and regulated.
537420	540060	Well that was undoubtedly part of it.
540060	545100	A huge additional chunk of this growth was precipitated by a carefully choreographed,
545100	550180	long-planned deluge of spending and effort by the burgeoning industry—a well-funded
550180	554460	scramble for market share before a hierarchy could set in.
554460	560140	They knew that if the industry looked anything less than unstoppable, it could be stopped.
560140	565020	Step one was to normalize the practice, and for this, the industry was gifted a massive
565020	568600	opportunity—the COVID-19 pandemic.
568600	573220	With the world of sports reopening into a new, less physical, less social context, the
573220	578100	industry realized it could capitalize on the degraded fan experience to effectively manufacture
578100	579620	a new normal.
580060	586660	COVID was slowly and steadily growing pre-pandemic, but come Q3 2020, as the NHL, NBA, and MLB
586660	591260	restarted their seasons in various forms of biosecure bubbles, the industry spent three
591260	595340	times more than any prior quarter on TV advertising.
595340	598260	And logos went everywhere.
598260	602360	FanDuel adorned the boards around the NHL's pandemic-proof rink in Edmonton, on screens
602360	605740	sitting where the NBA's courtside seats would normally go, on the pitcher's mound
605740	610780	at MLB ballparks, and anywhere else where a competitor hadn't already inked a deal.
610780	614780	With the knowledge that their most promising customer demographic was 18- to 35-year-old
614780	618780	men, based on their above-average propensity to develop long-term, potentially addictive
618780	624200	gambling habits, companies even inked deals with LSU, Michigan State University, CU Boulder,
624200	628780	and other colleges to advertise sports betting to their own students—sometimes, as a New
628780	633840	York Times investigation exposed, to the extent of paying a fixed amount per sign-up.
633840	637880	This sports betting omnipresence wasn't normal, but it was tough for anyone to recognize
637880	640160	that when nothing was.
640160	644300	But making the practice feel as integral to the sports viewing experience as donning a
644300	648440	jersey or assembling some nachos was only half the battle.
648440	652160	Once the gambling companies got people in, they had to keep them—they had to turn a
652160	656800	sign-up into a habit, and for that, there were inducements.
656800	660460	The concept is loosely based on the casino experience.
660460	666500	In Vegas, around 40% of gambling is conducted by the top 5% of gamblers—the high rollers—so
666500	671060	the casinos generally focus their inherently limited resources on keeping these gamblers
671060	672060	gambling.
672060	676740	Typically, that task falls onto the casino hosts—they're supposed to act as the high
676740	680980	rollers' friend, accompanying them to dinners, arranging show tickets, grabbing drinks from
680980	685740	the bar, booking free flights, really doing anything they can to make the guests' experience
685740	686740	better.
686740	691660	What their job really is is to use that social dynamic, and the power to occasionally reimburse
691660	697340	some losses, to subtly nudge the high roller towards playing more and betting bigger.
697340	701300	The opportunity with online sports betting was that this task could be automated and
701300	706540	extended to all, no matter if they bet $1 or $1 million.
706540	710080	For example, if an algorithm predicts that a player is likely to stop betting after a
710080	716220	string of losses, which some can with remarkable accuracy, it'll automatically offer a risk-free
716220	719820	bet—if they lose the next one, they'll get their money back.
719820	724660	But, the terms will indicate, the money returned can't be withdrawn—it has to be spent
724660	726160	on another bet.
726160	729700	After two additional bets, there's every chance the player wins one and decides to
729700	734060	keep going, but even if they don't, they've gotten back into the groove of it so, even
734060	738140	given the high cost of this inducement, the economics work out in aggregate so that free
738140	741160	bets are a winning proposition for the gambling companies.
741160	745740	The systems are just incredibly effective at forming a habit in their players in a cost-effective
746260	747260	manner.
747260	751580	Unsurprisingly, myriad academic research has demonstrated that inducements have a dramatic
751580	755620	effect on the size of bets, and encourages the behavior that turns gambling from a form
755620	758380	of entertainment into a problem.
758380	760460	Governments know this, and yet they allow this.
760460	765680	In fact, not only are inducements legal, but in many states, thanks to aggressive lobbying,
765680	770200	they are tax-exempt, meaning sports betting companies have avoided paying millions upon
770200	775420	millions of dollars in taxes by engaging in the practice that develops addicts.
775420	779820	Underfunded and overstretched, state regulatory agencies have been unable to properly manage
779820	783980	the sports betting companies, and their corresponding legislators have overwhelmingly failed to
783980	789140	resist the influence of some of America's highest-paid and most effective lobbyists.
789140	793260	While everyone in the equation hides it as best as possible, the gambling industry is
793260	798780	in charge—they're calling the shots, and America is slowly and quietly turning into
798780	801740	a nation of gamblers.
801740	804760	This is far from unprecedented.
804760	808520	On the other side of the equator, one of the US's closest cultural equivalents has
808520	815720	already marched far further down this path—Australia is already a nation of gamblers.
815720	820720	It is as deeply intertwined into society as guns are to America's.
820720	825400	No population loses more to gambling than Australia's—each adult resident averages
825400	831800	over $1,000 a year in loss, a clean doubling of America's equivalent figure—and the
831800	835440	explanation is concerningly straightforward.
835440	839040	In the US, casinos are a destination.
839040	843280	From the center of New York City, the closest proper one is a 50-minute trek into Queens.
843280	847360	From Dallas, it's an 80-minute drive north to Chickasaw land in Oklahoma.
847360	851680	From San Francisco, it's a similar 60-minute drive north into Sonoma County.
851680	856160	In Australia, however, casinos are city-center attractions.
856160	860280	Melbourne's Crown Casino development sits just across from the city's central business
860280	864920	district and has turned the riverfront into a lively nightlife destination that just happens
864920	867960	to include a place to play poker, roulette, or craps.
867960	872720	Sydney's newest tallest skyscraper now sits just steps away from the very location where
872720	877360	the first fleet of European settlers started their colony and acts as the home to another
877360	879360	Crown Casino development.
879360	883520	And up in Brisbane, a slice of its city center was torn down and is now being rebuilt into
883520	887720	the largest casino development in the country, which will tower over and look down upon the
887720	890020	historic neighborhood below.
890020	894180	Even Las Vegas separates the bulk of its casinos away from the city center.
894180	897100	In Australia, they're tough to avoid.
897100	899700	Gambling doesn't have to be purposefully planned.
899700	904320	It can simply be spontaneous—a convenient, accessible way to turn one's day around
904320	907100	for the better, or more often, worse.
907100	910860	But the concerning convenience compounds.
910860	918060	Across the country, nestled in a sizable proportion of bars and clubs, sit 188,000 slot machines,
918060	920380	or pokies, as the locals would call them.
920380	924580	That's one for every 137 residents.
924580	929020	They are simply everywhere, but they're especially in the areas that use them the
929020	933260	most, which more often than not are low-income neighborhoods.
933260	937940	In Sydney, for example, adult residents of the upscale Ritzy Coringa area only lost an
937940	941100	average of $180 a year to the pokies.
941100	946860	Meanwhile, to the west, in Fairfield, overwhelmingly home to low-income immigrant families, the
946860	953540	average adult lost nearly ten times as much—$1,558 a year.
953540	956780	And this pattern extends city and country-wide.
956780	961260	The lower the average income, the higher the average annual gambling loss.
961260	967140	From a systematic perspective, gambling in Australia is acting as a wealth transfer mechanism
967140	971860	from lower-income individuals to wealthy gambling conglomerate owners, and this has crafted
971860	975780	a legitimate, nationwide public health crisis.
975780	981720	Roughly one of every 14 Australians have exhibited signs of problematic gambling behavior.
981720	986100	The government says this, the government knows this, and yet the government enables this
986100	989660	because the gambling companies are in control.
989660	993420	The methods used to exert their influence are neither unique nor interesting—it's
993420	997580	the same lobbying, political donations, and revolving door between industry and politics
997580	999780	that you see in America and beyond.
999780	1004680	It's just its extent and effectiveness that sets Australia apart.
1004680	1008520	As many observers have put it, the gambling industry is Australia's equivalent of the
1008520	1010640	American gun lobby.
1010640	1016560	But there is still one final step in the gambling industry's grand plan.
1016560	1020020	People gamble more when it's convenient—we know that people play more when they live
1020020	1024040	closer to pokey machines, we know that people sports bet more when they can do so on their
1024040	1028060	phones, and so the gambling industry knows what their biggest legislative win to date
1028060	1029060	would be—iGaming.
1029060	1035060	That's the technical term for the broad-bucket of chance-based gambling, roulette, slots,
1035060	1039080	bingo, and more, taking place on the internet or apps.
1039080	1041380	This would create a problem.
1041380	1046980	Time and time and time again, a causal relationship has been demonstrated between accessibility
1046980	1051620	of gambling and the likelihood of it developing into a problem, so the legalization of iGaming
1051620	1055700	would undoubtedly increase the number of addicts.
1055700	1060300	Drinking can be safe and fun, just like alcohol can be safe and fun.
1060300	1064200	Consumed in the right amounts, in the right places, by the right people, there is no problem
1064200	1065200	with drinking.
1065200	1068660	Done in the right amounts, in the right places, by the right people, there doesn't have
1068660	1069980	to be a problem with gambling.
1069980	1076340	But in both cases, improper use can wreak havoc on life and livelihood.
1076340	1081780	And increasingly in America, legal gambling is occurring improperly.
1081780	1085900	Gambling has to be a destination, not a convenience.
1085900	1091340	Anyone can have a terrible, hopeless day, log onto an app, wager far more than is responsible,
1091340	1096020	lose it in an instant, and trigger a downward spiral of issues that turns a bad day into
1096020	1097660	a bad year.
1097660	1102460	Far fewer people can have a bad day, drive 80 minutes north to Oklahoma, and still think
1102460	1105500	it's a good idea to wager an excessive amount.
1105500	1110580	Putting such potential pain in people's pockets requires a degree of personal responsibility
1110580	1116340	that few players are able to consistently fulfill across the full spectrum of emotions.
1116340	1121940	Right now, on average, across the US, the power balance swings towards gambling companies
1121940	1124300	rather than the regulators.
1124300	1129200	Underfunded and overworked state regulators are struggling to cope with the massive, well-funded
1129200	1135340	explosion in online gambling, and so regulation of existing rules is inconsistent and weak.
1135340	1139420	Gambling companies feel this, and it means they consistently operate off of forgiveness,
1139420	1141000	rather than permission.
1141000	1145700	Gambling companies need to be terrified of regulators to keep the industry safe.
1145700	1150180	Notably, Nevada's Gaming Commission has a death grip on Las Vegas casinos, holding
1150180	1154520	them to an exceptionally high standard, leading to gambling companies often operating above
1154520	1157300	those standards to allow for margin of error.
1157300	1162340	But in the rest of the US, those very same companies and more consistently skirt, bend,
1162340	1166740	and push the rules because they know they can get away with it—they downplay the risk
1166740	1170740	of loss in advertising, even when that's illegal, they allow gamblers to accumulate
1170740	1174660	credit card debt through deposits, even when that's illegal, they operate sports betting
1174660	1178940	on lower-division semi-professional leagues, even when that's illegal, and more often
1178940	1182960	than not, they're just told to do better in the future.
1182960	1187460	Sports betting doesn't have to be a problem—it can be what it's portrayed as, it can be
1187460	1192180	a fun, social way of upping the emotional stakes of the viewing experience—but far
1192180	1195340	too often, it fails to hit the mark.
1195340	1199660	Faced with few roadblocks and increasingly capable of knocking the remaining ones down,
1199660	1204820	the industry is doing what industry does—finding and following the greatest possible revenue
1204820	1209900	opportunity by turning the US into a nation of addicts.
1209900	1212700	The trend is worrying, and it is a trend.
1212700	1216740	West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Michigan all have
1216740	1222600	legalized some form of iGaming, and more states are expected to follow in 2023.
1222600	1226840	The dominoes are falling, the slow, silent march continues, and the gambling industry
1226840	1233120	takes another step forward in its grand plan to consume America and Americans alike.
1233120	1238480	Okay, so I'm really weirdly excited for this ad read because it's been an incredibly
1238480	1239880	long time coming.
1239880	1243240	Six months ago I made a video called the carbon offset problem, where the conclusion was that
1243240	1248120	while carbon offsets as a concept can theoretically work, the current marketplace for them enables
1248120	1251840	and even incentivizes scams to the point where they're nothing more than a greenwashing
1251840	1252840	tool on average.
1252840	1257000	The video got a ton of attention, and was even included in a John Oliver segment about
1257000	1260760	the same subject, and then a little later the people at a company called Wren reached
1260760	1264520	out and claimed they had created a system to help make offsets actually work.
1264520	1268680	I talked with their CEO Landon, their project evaluator Sophie, and a few others over there
1268680	1272200	for over an hour, and they walked me through the process and responded really well to all
1272200	1276840	my grilling, and I left pretty confident that Wren is as good as it gets in the carbon offsetting
1276840	1277840	market.
1277840	1281460	As you might remember from my video, offsetting is only as good as the accuracy of project
1281460	1286340	evaluation, so their project evaluator Sophie showed me the hundreds of tiny, tiny details
1286340	1290060	that she individually verifies to make sure a project is actually going to do what it
1290060	1294100	says it will, and it's an ongoing process once the project actually starts, too.
1294100	1298400	They only have seven active projects so they put a ton of focus into each, but one thing
1298400	1302500	I think is really smart is they only sell offsets in a combined portfolio of all of
1302500	1306940	these—that way they reduce risk and build in a margin for error if one project falls
1306940	1307940	short.
1307940	1311180	In addition, unlike single project offsets, they can use the fund to help finance more
1311180	1315240	experimental or ancillary projects that still help fight the climate crisis but are tougher
1315240	1316860	to quantify in tons of carbon.
1316860	1320520	For example, they recently added Carbon 180 to the mix, where they're helping this policy
1320520	1324340	group that advocates and works for more funding for offset projects, which hopefully leads
1324340	1325940	to a compounding effect.
1325940	1329180	I could go on and on about all the different tiny ways they assure what they're doing
1329180	1333180	actually works, but the thing to know is that, based on what I know about their subject,
1333180	1336540	Wren is the real deal and if you're still skeptical you should check out their website
1336540	1338780	because they do a good job of explaining how.
1339000	1342900	So, if you want to be genuinely as sure as possible that you actually offset emissions
1342900	1345780	from taking a flight, for example, they're the place to go.
1345780	1349360	I've turned down plenty of carbon offsetting sponsors in the past, and I've opened myself
1349360	1352800	up to plenty of criticism by doing this since I've been such a vocal critic of the carbon
1352800	1355820	offsetting market, so you can know that I genuinely believe in them.
1355820	1359900	They'll be what I use going forward both for my personal and business carbon offsetting,
1359900	1363480	and I think you should too—they make it super simple to calculate your personal carbon
1363480	1366500	footprint and give personalized suggestions on how to reduce it.
1366500	1370220	Then, for anything else, you can set up a monthly offset so you can reduce your personal
1370220	1372380	contribution to the climate crisis.
1372380	1375700	Doing this probably costs a lot less than you think, and it's even less considering
1375700	1379020	that if you click the button on screen or head to our link in the description, they'll
1379020	1382940	pay to offset the first month of emissions for the first 100 people to sign up.
