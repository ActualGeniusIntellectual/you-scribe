1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,460
The beginnings were as inadvertent as they come.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:08,140
Hastily drawn up and jammed into the entirely unrelated Safe Port Act, the Unlawful Internet

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,020
Gambling Enforcement Act passed through Congress in September of 2006, then, with President

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,280
Bush's signature a month later, became law.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,020
The unremarkable bit of legislation banned gambling companies from taking payments over

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,420
the internet made in violation of state or federal law.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,700
The old guard of online gambling—the likes of Full Tilt Poker, Poker Stars, and Absolute

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,280
Poker—the new law would prove an existential threat.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,460
For a set of upstarts, though, it'd function as the legal foundation of an as-yet untapped

10
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:37,460
market.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,260
In trying to close one loophole, the Act opened another with this seemingly innocuous exemption—that

12
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,220
betting and wagering did not include participation in fantasy sports, which were deemed as games

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,860
of scale, not chance.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:54,020
At the time, the distinction made sense—fantasy sports were fundamentally different from any

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,940
sort of online gambling.

16
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,320
People didn't get rich off fantasy sports, nor did they lose thousands, tens of thousands,

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,720
or hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fell swoop.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,100
Fantasy team owners wagered on season-long outcomes with their friends from school or

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,740
work, and poured over stat sheets for bragging rights as much as money.

20
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,620
They might have been obsessed, but they were never quite addicted.

21
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:19,580
Then, in 2009, a fateful backyard brainstorm at South by Southwest completely altered the

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:24,740
trajectory of fantasy sports and, as it would turn out, sports betting.

23
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,020
The company that coalesced under the Austin sun was called FanDuel, and it was everything

24
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,100
that fantasy wasn't.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,780
Countering the traditional season-long league, FanDuel offered daily fantasy.

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,100
Rather than just playing with your buddies, the service provided tournaments and cash

27
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,060
games to compete against countless others.

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,920
Whereas traditional fantasy leagues only saw minimal financial exchanges in league buy-ins

29
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,780
and annual draft guides, FanDuel moved major money.

30
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,940
Just one good day they advertised could net a couple thousand dollars, and, thanks to

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:00,480
the Unlawful Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, it was online and in your pocket.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,860
What had been slow-moving and cumbersome was now fast and convenient—just play from your

33
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,320
phone, win, and cash out that very same day.

34
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,020
Young people followed, and so too did money.

35
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:18,380
FanDuel's first rounds of funding topped $1 million, then $4 million, then, by 2013,

36
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,920
$11 million.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,620
As investment climbed, so too did winnings.

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,660
That same year, the platform crowned its first million-dollar prize winner during its December

39
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,860
Fantasy Football Championship and dished out more than $150 million in prize money overall.

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,380
The following year, FanDuel partnered with the NBA, while its rising competitor, Draftkings,

41
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,420
nabbed the MLB and NHL.

42
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,940
Suddenly, companies that didn't exist just years prior were outspending the entire beer

43
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,780
industry, running ads every 90 seconds on national TV.

44
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,820
With palm-of-your-hand convenience, cheap buy-ins, mouthwatering prize potential, and

45
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,020
unavoidable promotional offers, daily fantasy services had maximized the potential of fantasy

46
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
sports.

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,740
Sports fans played, sports leagues and media invested, while critics and academics began

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,380
asking exactly to what extent this sped-up, further gamified version of fantasy sports

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,940
actually differed from sports betting.

50
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,600
Yet, rather than regulators intervening, legislators, league leaders, team owners, and daily fantasy

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,200
consumers alike began to rethink just how bad sports betting really was.

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,000
Banned by Congress in every state except Nevada, and opposed by all major leagues, sports betting

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,720
had long been perceived as the antithesis of fair sport.

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,080
This wasn't only the position held by league commissioners, either, as 56% of Americans

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,080
polled in 1993 disapproved of its legalization.

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,700
Through the 2000s, after point-shaving scandals rocked college basketball, then insider betting

57
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,460
and the NBA came to light, betting remained a dark, shady sports underworld in the view

58
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,720
of most and, to league leaders, a direct threat.

59
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,820
Even through 2012, NFL's Roger Goodell, MLB's Bud Selig, NHL's Gary Bettman, and

60
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:59,260
NCAA's Mark Emmert each came out against the idea of overturning the federal ban.

61
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,420
Or at least that's what they said outwardly.

62
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,340
As teams and leagues entered partnerships with gambling-adjacent fantasy platforms,

63
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,980
internal conversations slowly shifted from sports betting as a scourge to sports betting

64
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,200
as a potential opportunity.

65
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,580
Daily fantasy drove more fan engagement, and so too would sports betting.

66
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,880
At the same time, sports fans were voting with their wallets, as the American Gaming

67
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,380
Association estimated that Americans were spending about $150 billion on wagers annually,

68
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,140
with only a small fraction actually going through legal means in Nevada.

69
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,540
Then finally, the head of the NBA came out and said it.

70
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,940
If Americans were spending billions on sports bets, American newspapers and media were publishing

71
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,700
betting lines, and other countries were finding success in regulating nationwide gambling,

72
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,460
then why not just legalize it?

73
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,180
By and large, the public followed the logic, as 2017 polling showed that 55% of Americans

74
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,820
had now come to favor the idea of legalized regulated gambling, while only 33% opposed

75
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,820
it.

76
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,860
Polling, though, doesn't overturn federal bans.

77
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,740
But the timing was perfect.

78
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,940
While daily fantasy shot skyward, and American opinion came around, the legality of the federal

79
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,860
ban was coming under question.

80
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,900
New Jersey's effort to legalize sports betting to prop up a faltering Atlantic city had climbed

81
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,820
all the way to the Supreme Court, and in 2018, a surprise ruling opened the floodgates as

82
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,700
Justice Alito delivered the 7 to 2 opinion acknowledging that while sports gambling is

83
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,940
fraught with controversy, it ultimately wasn't the federal government's constitutional right

84
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,900
to ban it—rather, that it was the choice of each individual state.

85
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,100
The race was on.

86
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,820
Eight states legalized sports betting in 2018.

87
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,300
Ten more joined in 2019.

88
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,540
Sportsbooks opened in state and tribal casinos, sports venues added betting kiosks, while

89
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,340
DraftKings and FanDuel, the darlings of daily fantasy, opened up brick and mortar lounges

90
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,740
across the US and launched mobile online betting in states that allowed it.

91
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,180
But this race to legalize wasn't between states.

92
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,020
This was a time trial to see which gambling industry representatives could secure legalization

93
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,300
as quickly as possible in the friendliest terms possible.

94
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,460
The likes of FanDuel and DraftKings, who had previously spent millions ensuring that state

95
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,180
legislators saw daily fantasy as a game of skill and not of luck, the strategy was already

96
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:16,120
established and the team already assembled.

97
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,660
From Trenton to Tallahassee to Topeka, lobbyists bought lawmakers gifts and presented the plot

98
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,300
points of a new path over expensive glasses of wine.

99
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,460
The best sports betting they pitched would bring tax revenue by the millions, and besides,

100
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,200
they argued, people were betting illegally anyway—why not bring it above board, bring

101
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,340
in revenue, and create a win-win?

102
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,480
Or what about a win-win-win, they'd ask, where regulations and taxes are slightly less

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,920
burdensome so more sportsbooks are incentivized to enter the market, so more users have more

104
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,900
outlets to bet, so more volume brings the state more tax revenue?

105
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,340
The pressure was immense as the deep pockets of the world's most recognizable casinos

106
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,060
spared no expense in helping state legislators see the issue from their point of view.

107
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,940
While the extent varied from state to state, the blitz was largely a success.

108
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:07,780
By 2022, 30 US states and Washington DC had some form of legal and active sports betting.

109
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,420
And this wasn't the sports betting of old—this was sports betting in the digital age.

110
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:16,560
Sure, like before, people bet on the individual outcome of the game they were going to to

111
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,220
heighten the experience, they put future bets down on whether or not the teams would match

112
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,340
the win totals that their sportsbook projected, and wagered on odds for end-of-season awards

113
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,880
and champions, but now they bet on far more, too.

114
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,700
Odds not for games but for halves and quarters, propositional bets that didn't have to do

115
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,900
with the outcome of the game like player points or shots on goals, and in-game parlays that

116
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,160
combine propositional bets with score outcomes to boost potential payouts.

117
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,360
Just as mobile devices turned fantasy games from four-month seasons to daily games, mobile

118
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,940
gaming apps unlocked in-game betting that people could wager on in the middle of the

119
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,740
sporting event they were watching on TV.

120
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,920
People had more options and easier access than ever before, and the established gaming

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,060
houses of Vegas took note.

122
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,100
Joining FanDuel and DraftKings were online sportsbooks by familiar names like BetMGM,

123
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:05,500
Caesars, WinBet, and Penn National Gaming's Barstool Sportsbook, while various other casinos

124
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,740
and companies launched smaller, more regional online outfits.

125
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,100
In 2019, US betting revenue doubled that of 2018.

126
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,440
Then 2020, despite sports as an entity disappearing globally for a matter of months, saw revenue

127
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,920
nearly double once again, then in 2021, revenue tripled to over $4.3 billion a year.

128
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,580
Simply put, sports betting just exploded.

129
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,660
Or at least, it looked like it exploded.

130
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,920
It looked like an unmitigated force of nature, perhaps triggered by humans, but hardly managed

131
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
by them.

132
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,780
But that's what the industry wanted it to look like.

133
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,140
To support the plot that they had laid out to legislators prior to legalization, they

134
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,100
wanted it to look like this was only natural—that there was always a huge volume of betting

135
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,380
behind closed doors and that sector growth merely represented this phenomenon moving

136
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,420
into the legal space where it could be taxed and regulated.

137
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,060
Well that was undoubtedly part of it.

138
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,100
A huge additional chunk of this growth was precipitated by a carefully choreographed,

139
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,180
long-planned deluge of spending and effort by the burgeoning industry—a well-funded

140
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:14,460
scramble for market share before a hierarchy could set in.

141
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,140
They knew that if the industry looked anything less than unstoppable, it could be stopped.

142
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:25,020
Step one was to normalize the practice, and for this, the industry was gifted a massive

143
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,600
opportunity—the COVID-19 pandemic.

144
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,220
With the world of sports reopening into a new, less physical, less social context, the

145
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,100
industry realized it could capitalize on the degraded fan experience to effectively manufacture

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,620
a new normal.

147
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,660
COVID was slowly and steadily growing pre-pandemic, but come Q3 2020, as the NHL, NBA, and MLB

148
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,260
restarted their seasons in various forms of biosecure bubbles, the industry spent three

149
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,340
times more than any prior quarter on TV advertising.

150
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,260
And logos went everywhere.

151
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,360
FanDuel adorned the boards around the NHL's pandemic-proof rink in Edmonton, on screens

152
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,740
sitting where the NBA's courtside seats would normally go, on the pitcher's mound

153
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,780
at MLB ballparks, and anywhere else where a competitor hadn't already inked a deal.

154
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,780
With the knowledge that their most promising customer demographic was 18- to 35-year-old

155
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,780
men, based on their above-average propensity to develop long-term, potentially addictive

156
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,200
gambling habits, companies even inked deals with LSU, Michigan State University, CU Boulder,

157
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,780
and other colleges to advertise sports betting to their own students—sometimes, as a New

158
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,840
York Times investigation exposed, to the extent of paying a fixed amount per sign-up.

159
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,880
This sports betting omnipresence wasn't normal, but it was tough for anyone to recognize

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,160
that when nothing was.

161
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,300
But making the practice feel as integral to the sports viewing experience as donning a

162
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,440
jersey or assembling some nachos was only half the battle.

163
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,160
Once the gambling companies got people in, they had to keep them—they had to turn a

164
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,800
sign-up into a habit, and for that, there were inducements.

165
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,460
The concept is loosely based on the casino experience.

166
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,500
In Vegas, around 40% of gambling is conducted by the top 5% of gamblers—the high rollers—so

167
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,060
the casinos generally focus their inherently limited resources on keeping these gamblers

168
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
gambling.

169
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,740
Typically, that task falls onto the casino hosts—they're supposed to act as the high

170
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,980
rollers' friend, accompanying them to dinners, arranging show tickets, grabbing drinks from

171
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,740
the bar, booking free flights, really doing anything they can to make the guests' experience

172
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
better.

173
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,660
What their job really is is to use that social dynamic, and the power to occasionally reimburse

174
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,340
some losses, to subtly nudge the high roller towards playing more and betting bigger.

175
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,300
The opportunity with online sports betting was that this task could be automated and

176
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,540
extended to all, no matter if they bet $1 or $1 million.

177
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:50,080
For example, if an algorithm predicts that a player is likely to stop betting after a

178
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,220
string of losses, which some can with remarkable accuracy, it'll automatically offer a risk-free

179
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,820
bet—if they lose the next one, they'll get their money back.

180
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,660
But, the terms will indicate, the money returned can't be withdrawn—it has to be spent

181
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,160
on another bet.

182
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,700
After two additional bets, there's every chance the player wins one and decides to

183
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,060
keep going, but even if they don't, they've gotten back into the groove of it so, even

184
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:18,140
given the high cost of this inducement, the economics work out in aggregate so that free

185
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,160
bets are a winning proposition for the gambling companies.

186
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,740
The systems are just incredibly effective at forming a habit in their players in a cost-effective

187
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
manner.

188
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:31,580
Unsurprisingly, myriad academic research has demonstrated that inducements have a dramatic

189
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,620
effect on the size of bets, and encourages the behavior that turns gambling from a form

190
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,380
of entertainment into a problem.

191
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,460
Governments know this, and yet they allow this.

192
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,680
In fact, not only are inducements legal, but in many states, thanks to aggressive lobbying,

193
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,200
they are tax-exempt, meaning sports betting companies have avoided paying millions upon

194
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,420
millions of dollars in taxes by engaging in the practice that develops addicts.

195
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,820
Underfunded and overstretched, state regulatory agencies have been unable to properly manage

196
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,980
the sports betting companies, and their corresponding legislators have overwhelmingly failed to

197
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:09,140
resist the influence of some of America's highest-paid and most effective lobbyists.

198
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,260
While everyone in the equation hides it as best as possible, the gambling industry is

199
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:18,780
in charge—they're calling the shots, and America is slowly and quietly turning into

200
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,740
a nation of gamblers.

201
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,760
This is far from unprecedented.

202
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,520
On the other side of the equator, one of the US's closest cultural equivalents has

203
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:35,720
already marched far further down this path—Australia is already a nation of gamblers.

204
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,720
It is as deeply intertwined into society as guns are to America's.

205
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,400
No population loses more to gambling than Australia's—each adult resident averages

206
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:51,800
over $1,000 a year in loss, a clean doubling of America's equivalent figure—and the

207
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,440
explanation is concerningly straightforward.

208
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,040
In the US, casinos are a destination.

209
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,280
From the center of New York City, the closest proper one is a 50-minute trek into Queens.

210
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,360
From Dallas, it's an 80-minute drive north to Chickasaw land in Oklahoma.

211
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,680
From San Francisco, it's a similar 60-minute drive north into Sonoma County.

212
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,160
In Australia, however, casinos are city-center attractions.

213
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,280
Melbourne's Crown Casino development sits just across from the city's central business

214
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,920
district and has turned the riverfront into a lively nightlife destination that just happens

215
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,960
to include a place to play poker, roulette, or craps.

216
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,720
Sydney's newest tallest skyscraper now sits just steps away from the very location where

217
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
the first fleet of European settlers started their colony and acts as the home to another

218
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
Crown Casino development.

219
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,520
And up in Brisbane, a slice of its city center was torn down and is now being rebuilt into

220
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,720
the largest casino development in the country, which will tower over and look down upon the

221
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,020
historic neighborhood below.

222
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,180
Even Las Vegas separates the bulk of its casinos away from the city center.

223
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,100
In Australia, they're tough to avoid.

224
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,700
Gambling doesn't have to be purposefully planned.

225
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,320
It can simply be spontaneous—a convenient, accessible way to turn one's day around

226
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,100
for the better, or more often, worse.

227
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,860
But the concerning convenience compounds.

228
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:18,060
Across the country, nestled in a sizable proportion of bars and clubs, sit 188,000 slot machines,

229
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,380
or pokies, as the locals would call them.

230
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,580
That's one for every 137 residents.

231
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,020
They are simply everywhere, but they're especially in the areas that use them the

232
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,260
most, which more often than not are low-income neighborhoods.

233
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,940
In Sydney, for example, adult residents of the upscale Ritzy Coringa area only lost an

234
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,100
average of $180 a year to the pokies.

235
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,860
Meanwhile, to the west, in Fairfield, overwhelmingly home to low-income immigrant families, the

236
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:53,540
average adult lost nearly ten times as much—$1,558 a year.

237
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,780
And this pattern extends city and country-wide.

238
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:01,260
The lower the average income, the higher the average annual gambling loss.

239
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:07,140
From a systematic perspective, gambling in Australia is acting as a wealth transfer mechanism

240
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:11,860
from lower-income individuals to wealthy gambling conglomerate owners, and this has crafted

241
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,780
a legitimate, nationwide public health crisis.

242
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:21,720
Roughly one of every 14 Australians have exhibited signs of problematic gambling behavior.

243
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,100
The government says this, the government knows this, and yet the government enables this

244
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,660
because the gambling companies are in control.

245
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,420
The methods used to exert their influence are neither unique nor interesting—it's

246
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,580
the same lobbying, political donations, and revolving door between industry and politics

247
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,780
that you see in America and beyond.

248
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,680
It's just its extent and effectiveness that sets Australia apart.

249
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,520
As many observers have put it, the gambling industry is Australia's equivalent of the

250
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,640
American gun lobby.

251
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:56,560
But there is still one final step in the gambling industry's grand plan.

252
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,020
People gamble more when it's convenient—we know that people play more when they live

253
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,040
closer to pokey machines, we know that people sports bet more when they can do so on their

254
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,060
phones, and so the gambling industry knows what their biggest legislative win to date

255
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
would be—iGaming.

256
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:15,060
That's the technical term for the broad-bucket of chance-based gambling, roulette, slots,

257
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,080
bingo, and more, taking place on the internet or apps.

258
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,380
This would create a problem.

259
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,980
Time and time and time again, a causal relationship has been demonstrated between accessibility

260
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,620
of gambling and the likelihood of it developing into a problem, so the legalization of iGaming

261
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,700
would undoubtedly increase the number of addicts.

262
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:40,300
Drinking can be safe and fun, just like alcohol can be safe and fun.

263
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,200
Consumed in the right amounts, in the right places, by the right people, there is no problem

264
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
with drinking.

265
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,660
Done in the right amounts, in the right places, by the right people, there doesn't have

266
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,980
to be a problem with gambling.

267
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:56,340
But in both cases, improper use can wreak havoc on life and livelihood.

268
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,780
And increasingly in America, legal gambling is occurring improperly.

269
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,900
Gambling has to be a destination, not a convenience.

270
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:11,340
Anyone can have a terrible, hopeless day, log onto an app, wager far more than is responsible,

271
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,020
lose it in an instant, and trigger a downward spiral of issues that turns a bad day into

272
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,660
a bad year.

273
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,460
Far fewer people can have a bad day, drive 80 minutes north to Oklahoma, and still think

274
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,500
it's a good idea to wager an excessive amount.

275
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,580
Putting such potential pain in people's pockets requires a degree of personal responsibility

276
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,340
that few players are able to consistently fulfill across the full spectrum of emotions.

277
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,940
Right now, on average, across the US, the power balance swings towards gambling companies

278
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,300
rather than the regulators.

279
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:49,200
Underfunded and overworked state regulators are struggling to cope with the massive, well-funded

280
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,340
explosion in online gambling, and so regulation of existing rules is inconsistent and weak.

281
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,420
Gambling companies feel this, and it means they consistently operate off of forgiveness,

282
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,000
rather than permission.

283
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,700
Gambling companies need to be terrified of regulators to keep the industry safe.

284
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,180
Notably, Nevada's Gaming Commission has a death grip on Las Vegas casinos, holding

285
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,520
them to an exceptionally high standard, leading to gambling companies often operating above

286
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,300
those standards to allow for margin of error.

287
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,340
But in the rest of the US, those very same companies and more consistently skirt, bend,

288
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,740
and push the rules because they know they can get away with it—they downplay the risk

289
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,740
of loss in advertising, even when that's illegal, they allow gamblers to accumulate

290
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,660
credit card debt through deposits, even when that's illegal, they operate sports betting

291
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,940
on lower-division semi-professional leagues, even when that's illegal, and more often

292
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,960
than not, they're just told to do better in the future.

293
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,460
Sports betting doesn't have to be a problem—it can be what it's portrayed as, it can be

294
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,180
a fun, social way of upping the emotional stakes of the viewing experience—but far

295
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,340
too often, it fails to hit the mark.

296
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,660
Faced with few roadblocks and increasingly capable of knocking the remaining ones down,

297
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,820
the industry is doing what industry does—finding and following the greatest possible revenue

298
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:09,900
opportunity by turning the US into a nation of addicts.

299
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,700
The trend is worrying, and it is a trend.

300
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,740
West Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Michigan all have

301
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,600
legalized some form of iGaming, and more states are expected to follow in 2023.

302
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,840
The dominoes are falling, the slow, silent march continues, and the gambling industry

303
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,120
takes another step forward in its grand plan to consume America and Americans alike.

304
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,480
Okay, so I'm really weirdly excited for this ad read because it's been an incredibly

305
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,880
long time coming.

306
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,240
Six months ago I made a video called the carbon offset problem, where the conclusion was that

307
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,120
while carbon offsets as a concept can theoretically work, the current marketplace for them enables

308
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,840
and even incentivizes scams to the point where they're nothing more than a greenwashing

309
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
tool on average.

310
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,000
The video got a ton of attention, and was even included in a John Oliver segment about

311
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,760
the same subject, and then a little later the people at a company called Wren reached

312
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,520
out and claimed they had created a system to help make offsets actually work.

313
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,680
I talked with their CEO Landon, their project evaluator Sophie, and a few others over there

314
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,200
for over an hour, and they walked me through the process and responded really well to all

315
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,840
my grilling, and I left pretty confident that Wren is as good as it gets in the carbon offsetting

316
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
market.

317
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,460
As you might remember from my video, offsetting is only as good as the accuracy of project

318
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,340
evaluation, so their project evaluator Sophie showed me the hundreds of tiny, tiny details

319
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,060
that she individually verifies to make sure a project is actually going to do what it

320
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,100
says it will, and it's an ongoing process once the project actually starts, too.

321
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,400
They only have seven active projects so they put a ton of focus into each, but one thing

322
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,500
I think is really smart is they only sell offsets in a combined portfolio of all of

323
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,940
these—that way they reduce risk and build in a margin for error if one project falls

324
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,940
short.

325
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,180
In addition, unlike single project offsets, they can use the fund to help finance more

326
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,240
experimental or ancillary projects that still help fight the climate crisis but are tougher

327
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,860
to quantify in tons of carbon.

328
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,520
For example, they recently added Carbon 180 to the mix, where they're helping this policy

329
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,340
group that advocates and works for more funding for offset projects, which hopefully leads

330
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,940
to a compounding effect.

331
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,180
I could go on and on about all the different tiny ways they assure what they're doing

332
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,180
actually works, but the thing to know is that, based on what I know about their subject,

333
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,540
Wren is the real deal and if you're still skeptical you should check out their website

334
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,780
because they do a good job of explaining how.

335
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,900
So, if you want to be genuinely as sure as possible that you actually offset emissions

336
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,780
from taking a flight, for example, they're the place to go.

337
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,360
I've turned down plenty of carbon offsetting sponsors in the past, and I've opened myself

338
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,800
up to plenty of criticism by doing this since I've been such a vocal critic of the carbon

339
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,820
offsetting market, so you can know that I genuinely believe in them.

340
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,900
They'll be what I use going forward both for my personal and business carbon offsetting,

341
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,480
and I think you should too—they make it super simple to calculate your personal carbon

342
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,500
footprint and give personalized suggestions on how to reduce it.

343
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,220
Then, for anything else, you can set up a monthly offset so you can reduce your personal

344
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,380
contribution to the climate crisis.

345
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,700
Doing this probably costs a lot less than you think, and it's even less considering

346
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,020
that if you click the button on screen or head to our link in the description, they'll

347
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,940
pay to offset the first month of emissions for the first 100 people to sign up.
