00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
Two weeks ago, I posted a video on why flying is so expensive and people seemed to like

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,120
it.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,680
However, they wanted to know, how are budget airlines so cheap?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,740
Well, it's another complex answer, but an interesting one.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,440
For the purposes of simplicity, and to keep our European friends from feeling left out,

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,440
we'll focus on the European model of budget airlines.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,200
While there are low cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia, and plenty

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,360
of other places, budget airlines were really first successful in Europe and that's where

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,320
they're still most prominent today.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,880
The magnitude to which airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet reduced the cost in Europe is

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,160
also much more significant.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,040
Budget airlines in the US might be 10 or 20% less expensive than their traditional competitors

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,160
while in Europe, a fare on a budget airline might only cost half or a third of what you

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
would pay on a normal airline.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,740
You can regularly find 2-3 hour flights on budget airlines for less than 10 euros.

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,240
So how do they work?

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,020
Well, unsurprisingly, budget airlines essentially take every expensive part of the flight and

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,680
make them less expensive.

19
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,920
The most essential thing an airline needs is airplanes and it is possible to spend less

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,960
on those.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,720
In the months and years following 9-11, the growth of air travel stalled and most airlines

22
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,800
were simply fighting to survive.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:25,360
Meanwhile, Ryanair was thriving and placed a massive order of 151 737s from Boeing at

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,440
unbelievably low prices.

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,560
A circumstance like that luckily isn't frequent, but budget airlines can place large orders

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
at any time which gives them a bulk discount.

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,760
It might seem weird that a budget airline would buy brand new airplanes, but the newest

28
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,080
planes are the most efficient which saves fuel.

29
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:49,520
The fuel efficiency of new aircraft offsets the higher purchase price so EasyJet, JetBlue,

30
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,140
Ryanair, and Spirit Airlines all have younger fleets than any major airline.

31
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,800
Budget airlines will also typically have only one type of plane.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,840
Ryanair only operates 737s and EasyJet only operates the A320 family.

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,600
Having only one type of aircraft means that pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,360
ground staff only need to be trained on one type of aircraft which saves an enormous amount

35
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,040
of time and money.

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,560
Within the planes, budget airlines will often avoid luxuries to keep costs down.

37
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,320
Ryanair seats, for example, don't recline because that increases the initial purchase

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,520
price for seats and also requires more maintenance.

39
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,000
The seat design also saves time for flight attendants since there are no seatback pockets

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to clean between flights.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,840
Flight attendants on budget airlines are often in the beginning of their careers and receive

42
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,240
little training.

43
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,800
Of course they'll get the required safety training but only minimal hospitality training.

44
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
They'll also often serve multiple roles.

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,920
While on the ground, some of the flight attendants might go to the gate and check tickets while

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,840
others clean the airplane.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
Through this, the airline eliminates three or four positions that they would regularly

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
pay for.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,380
On board, flight attendants are of course responsible for food and drinks which are

50
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,280
almost never free.

51
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,960
On board service can be an excellent way for airlines to make money.

52
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:13,040
Many budget airlines also do duty free sales and Ryanair even sells lottery tickets.

53
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,440
Let's talk airports.

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,680
You're never going to see Ryanair fly to London Heathrow or Paris Charles de Gaulle

55
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,880
because those airports are expensive.

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,120
There's only a set amount of flights per day that can operate out of them so supply

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,520
and demand dictates that landing fees are high and slots are regulated.

58
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,480
Instead, Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton in London, or Beauvais in Paris which

59
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,280
by the way, is an 80 minute bus ride away from Paris, isn't technically in the same

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,120
region of Paris, and has a website that looks like this.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,160
In a lot of cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of a few airlines

62
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,380
flying out of an airport which gives them huge negotiating power.

63
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,000
Often they will take a small regional airport a ways away from a city and rebrand it as

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,840
another city airport.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,520
They can ask for lower landing and takeoff prices and if the airport doesn't comply,

66
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,360
they'll just leave and the airport will essentially cease to exist.

67
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:12,920
If there isn't a viable, cheap airport available around a city, budget airlines can also fly

68
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,560
to regular airports at less busy times when landing fees and the chance of delay might

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,880
be lower.

70
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,920
Now let's get into the nitty gritty.

71
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,780
The planes of budget airlines tend to operate all day, non-stop.

72
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:31,240
For example, in one day, this Ryanair plane went from Brussels to Copenhagen, Copenhagen

73
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,120
to Brussels, Brussels to Prague, Prague to Brussels, Brussels to Nimes, Nimes to Brussels,

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,040
Brussels to Trevioso, then finally Trevioso to Brussels.

75
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,920
Budget airlines will schedule only 30-45 minutes between the landing of one flight and the

76
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,760
takeoff of another which often leads to delays and leaves very little time to clean the aircraft.

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,100
This does, however, mean that the airplane is always making money and passengers are

78
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,800
not paying for time it's sitting around.

79
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
Ever wonder why Southwest doesn't have reserved seating?

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,680
Well by having a first come first serve system for seats, people almost always show up to

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,340
the gate early and line up in an orderly line.

82
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,900
This way, less time is spent on the ground boarding and more time in the air flying.

83
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,360
Another principle of budget airlines is the point to point model.

84
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
Most traditional airlines have hubs where most or all of their flights go in and out

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
of.

86
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:29,080
British Airways has London, Air France has Paris, KLM has Amsterdam.

87
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,600
To get to most places on these airlines, you have to connect through their hubs.

88
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,140
Budget airlines, on the other hand, try to have a lot of destinations from everywhere.

89
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,440
That does mean, however, that many destinations are served only a few times per week.

90
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,640
The cheapest budget airlines don't even allow for connections between their flights.

91
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,840
Allowing connections adds cost because then you have to pay for ground crews to transfer

92
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,360
bags, create a more complicated ticketing system, and pay to rebook a passenger if a

93
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,320
delay in their first flight makes them miss their second.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,520
Speaking of ticketing, there's often no way to get a ticket from a real person on

95
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,640
budget airlines.

96
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,800
Ryanair charges 45 pounds if you fail to print your ticket at home and EasyJet and some other

97
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,680
carriers have almost all their check-ins handled by machines.

98
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,320
This, once again, cuts down on personnel costs.

99
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,200
At the airport, these budget airlines won't bother using jetways because they're expensive.

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,680
They'll use steps and just have passengers walk across the tarmac or take a bus to the

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,400
plane.

102
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,040
Budget airlines make a lot of money, if done right.

103
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:38,520
EasyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air all have higher profit margins than Lufthansa, British Airways,

104
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,860
and Air France.

105
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,240
Many of the traditional airlines have unionized workers with salary agreements that cannot

106
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,840
be changed, while budget airlines can hire anyone and train them in a few months.

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,360
It's also hard for these traditional airlines to grow.

108
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,600
Any route they make has to be one with a lot of pre-existing demand since much of their

109
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,400
business comes from business travelers.

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,120
Since budget airlines are targeted more towards tourists, any destination that Ryanair, for

111
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,000
example, opens up in will become a popular destination just because it's possible to

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,860
get there for so cheap.

113
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,060
Some traditional airlines in Europe are opening their own budget airlines to get in on this

114
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,060
profit.

115
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,780
Air France created Transavia and Lufthansa created Eurowings, both of which are losing

116
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,760
massive amounts of money.

117
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,660
What they seem to forget is that the US went through this budget airline within an airline

118
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:33,260
phase a couple decades ago, Delta created Song, which failed, US Airways created Metrojet,

119
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,260
which failed, United created Shuttle, which failed, then they went into bankruptcy and

120
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,960
decided that they should try again and make Ted, which failed.

121
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,220
None of these worked.

122
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,720
The reason Ryanair and EasyJet are able to succeed where others have failed is largely

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,180
because they are so large and flexible.

124
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,220
They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands of employees, and

125
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,180
negotiating power that allows them to overpower competitors.

126
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:04,140
In the end, for us consumers, any competition is good competition.

127
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,940
Even failing budget airlines will bring down the cost of traditional airlines and allow

128
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,540
us to travel the world for less.

129
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
