0	6120	Two weeks ago, I posted a video on why flying is so expensive and people seemed to like
6120	7120	it.
7120	10680	However, they wanted to know, how are budget airlines so cheap?
10680	14740	Well, it's another complex answer, but an interesting one.
14740	19440	For the purposes of simplicity, and to keep our European friends from feeling left out,
19440	22440	we'll focus on the European model of budget airlines.
22440	27200	While there are low cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia, and plenty
27200	31360	of other places, budget airlines were really first successful in Europe and that's where
31360	33320	they're still most prominent today.
33320	37880	The magnitude to which airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet reduced the cost in Europe is
37880	40160	also much more significant.
40160	45040	Budget airlines in the US might be 10 or 20% less expensive than their traditional competitors
45040	50160	while in Europe, a fare on a budget airline might only cost half or a third of what you
50160	51920	would pay on a normal airline.
51920	57740	You can regularly find 2-3 hour flights on budget airlines for less than 10 euros.
57740	59240	So how do they work?
59240	64020	Well, unsurprisingly, budget airlines essentially take every expensive part of the flight and
64020	65680	make them less expensive.
65680	69920	The most essential thing an airline needs is airplanes and it is possible to spend less
69920	70960	on those.
70960	75720	In the months and years following 9-11, the growth of air travel stalled and most airlines
75720	77800	were simply fighting to survive.
77800	85360	Meanwhile, Ryanair was thriving and placed a massive order of 151 737s from Boeing at
85360	87440	unbelievably low prices.
87440	92560	A circumstance like that luckily isn't frequent, but budget airlines can place large orders
92560	95680	at any time which gives them a bulk discount.
95680	99760	It might seem weird that a budget airline would buy brand new airplanes, but the newest
99760	103080	planes are the most efficient which saves fuel.
103080	109520	The fuel efficiency of new aircraft offsets the higher purchase price so EasyJet, JetBlue,
109520	115140	Ryanair, and Spirit Airlines all have younger fleets than any major airline.
115140	118800	Budget airlines will also typically have only one type of plane.
118800	124840	Ryanair only operates 737s and EasyJet only operates the A320 family.
124840	129600	Having only one type of aircraft means that pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and
129600	134360	ground staff only need to be trained on one type of aircraft which saves an enormous amount
134360	136040	of time and money.
136040	140560	Within the planes, budget airlines will often avoid luxuries to keep costs down.
140560	145320	Ryanair seats, for example, don't recline because that increases the initial purchase
145320	148520	price for seats and also requires more maintenance.
148520	153000	The seat design also saves time for flight attendants since there are no seatback pockets
153000	155000	to clean between flights.
155000	158840	Flight attendants on budget airlines are often in the beginning of their careers and receive
158840	160240	little training.
160240	164800	Of course they'll get the required safety training but only minimal hospitality training.
164800	167840	They'll also often serve multiple roles.
167840	171920	While on the ground, some of the flight attendants might go to the gate and check tickets while
171920	173840	others clean the airplane.
173840	177360	Through this, the airline eliminates three or four positions that they would regularly
177360	178360	pay for.
178360	182380	On board, flight attendants are of course responsible for food and drinks which are
182380	184280	almost never free.
184280	187960	On board service can be an excellent way for airlines to make money.
187960	193040	Many budget airlines also do duty free sales and Ryanair even sells lottery tickets.
193040	194440	Let's talk airports.
194440	198680	You're never going to see Ryanair fly to London Heathrow or Paris Charles de Gaulle
198680	200880	because those airports are expensive.
200880	205120	There's only a set amount of flights per day that can operate out of them so supply
205120	209520	and demand dictates that landing fees are high and slots are regulated.
209520	215480	Instead, Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton in London, or Beauvais in Paris which
215480	220280	by the way, is an 80 minute bus ride away from Paris, isn't technically in the same
220280	224120	region of Paris, and has a website that looks like this.
224120	229160	In a lot of cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of a few airlines
229160	233380	flying out of an airport which gives them huge negotiating power.
233380	238000	Often they will take a small regional airport a ways away from a city and rebrand it as
238000	239840	another city airport.
239840	244520	They can ask for lower landing and takeoff prices and if the airport doesn't comply,
244560	248360	they'll just leave and the airport will essentially cease to exist.
248360	252920	If there isn't a viable, cheap airport available around a city, budget airlines can also fly
252920	257560	to regular airports at less busy times when landing fees and the chance of delay might
257560	258880	be lower.
258880	260920	Now let's get into the nitty gritty.
260920	265780	The planes of budget airlines tend to operate all day, non-stop.
265780	271240	For example, in one day, this Ryanair plane went from Brussels to Copenhagen, Copenhagen
271240	277120	to Brussels, Brussels to Prague, Prague to Brussels, Brussels to Nimes, Nimes to Brussels,
277120	281040	Brussels to Trevioso, then finally Trevioso to Brussels.
281040	285920	Budget airlines will schedule only 30-45 minutes between the landing of one flight and the
285920	291760	takeoff of another which often leads to delays and leaves very little time to clean the aircraft.
291760	296100	This does, however, mean that the airplane is always making money and passengers are
296100	298800	not paying for time it's sitting around.
298880	301880	Ever wonder why Southwest doesn't have reserved seating?
301880	306680	Well by having a first come first serve system for seats, people almost always show up to
306680	310340	the gate early and line up in an orderly line.
310340	315900	This way, less time is spent on the ground boarding and more time in the air flying.
315900	319360	Another principle of budget airlines is the point to point model.
319360	323520	Most traditional airlines have hubs where most or all of their flights go in and out
323520	324520	of.
324520	329080	British Airways has London, Air France has Paris, KLM has Amsterdam.
329080	333600	To get to most places on these airlines, you have to connect through their hubs.
333600	338140	Budget airlines, on the other hand, try to have a lot of destinations from everywhere.
338140	343440	That does mean, however, that many destinations are served only a few times per week.
343440	347640	The cheapest budget airlines don't even allow for connections between their flights.
347640	351840	Allowing connections adds cost because then you have to pay for ground crews to transfer
351840	356360	bags, create a more complicated ticketing system, and pay to rebook a passenger if a
356360	359320	delay in their first flight makes them miss their second.
359320	363520	Speaking of ticketing, there's often no way to get a ticket from a real person on
363520	364640	budget airlines.
364640	369800	Ryanair charges 45 pounds if you fail to print your ticket at home and EasyJet and some other
369800	373680	carriers have almost all their check-ins handled by machines.
373680	377320	This, once again, cuts down on personnel costs.
377320	382200	At the airport, these budget airlines won't bother using jetways because they're expensive.
382200	386680	They'll use steps and just have passengers walk across the tarmac or take a bus to the
386680	388400	plane.
388400	392040	Budget airlines make a lot of money, if done right.
392040	398520	EasyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air all have higher profit margins than Lufthansa, British Airways,
398520	399860	and Air France.
399860	404240	Many of the traditional airlines have unionized workers with salary agreements that cannot
404240	408840	be changed, while budget airlines can hire anyone and train them in a few months.
408840	412360	It's also hard for these traditional airlines to grow.
412360	416600	Any route they make has to be one with a lot of pre-existing demand since much of their
416600	419400	business comes from business travelers.
419400	424120	Since budget airlines are targeted more towards tourists, any destination that Ryanair, for
424120	429000	example, opens up in will become a popular destination just because it's possible to
429000	430860	get there for so cheap.
430860	435060	Some traditional airlines in Europe are opening their own budget airlines to get in on this
435060	436060	profit.
436060	440780	Air France created Transavia and Lufthansa created Eurowings, both of which are losing
440780	442760	massive amounts of money.
442760	446660	What they seem to forget is that the US went through this budget airline within an airline
446660	453260	phase a couple decades ago, Delta created Song, which failed, US Airways created Metrojet,
453260	458260	which failed, United created Shuttle, which failed, then they went into bankruptcy and
458260	461960	decided that they should try again and make Ted, which failed.
461960	463220	None of these worked.
463220	467720	The reason Ryanair and EasyJet are able to succeed where others have failed is largely
467720	470180	because they are so large and flexible.
470180	475220	They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands of employees, and
475220	479180	negotiating power that allows them to overpower competitors.
479180	484140	In the end, for us consumers, any competition is good competition.
484140	487940	Even failing budget airlines will bring down the cost of traditional airlines and allow
487940	490540	us to travel the world for less.
