00:00.000 --> 00:06.120
Two weeks ago, I posted a video on why flying is so expensive and people seemed to like

00:06.120 --> 00:07.120
it.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.680
However, they wanted to know, how are budget airlines so cheap?

00:10.680 --> 00:14.740
Well, it's another complex answer, but an interesting one.

00:14.740 --> 00:19.440
For the purposes of simplicity, and to keep our European friends from feeling left out,

00:19.440 --> 00:22.440
we'll focus on the European model of budget airlines.

00:22.440 --> 00:27.200
While there are low cost carriers in North America, South Africa, India, Asia, and plenty

00:27.200 --> 00:31.360
of other places, budget airlines were really first successful in Europe and that's where

00:31.360 --> 00:33.320
they're still most prominent today.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.880
The magnitude to which airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet reduced the cost in Europe is

00:37.880 --> 00:40.160
also much more significant.

00:40.160 --> 00:45.040
Budget airlines in the US might be 10 or 20% less expensive than their traditional competitors

00:45.040 --> 00:50.160
while in Europe, a fare on a budget airline might only cost half or a third of what you

00:50.160 --> 00:51.920
would pay on a normal airline.

00:51.920 --> 00:57.740
You can regularly find 2-3 hour flights on budget airlines for less than 10 euros.

00:57.740 --> 00:59.240
So how do they work?

00:59.240 --> 01:04.020
Well, unsurprisingly, budget airlines essentially take every expensive part of the flight and

01:04.020 --> 01:05.680
make them less expensive.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.920
The most essential thing an airline needs is airplanes and it is possible to spend less

01:09.920 --> 01:10.960
on those.

01:10.960 --> 01:15.720
In the months and years following 9-11, the growth of air travel stalled and most airlines

01:15.720 --> 01:17.800
were simply fighting to survive.

01:17.800 --> 01:25.360
Meanwhile, Ryanair was thriving and placed a massive order of 151 737s from Boeing at

01:25.360 --> 01:27.440
unbelievably low prices.

01:27.440 --> 01:32.560
A circumstance like that luckily isn't frequent, but budget airlines can place large orders

01:32.560 --> 01:35.680
at any time which gives them a bulk discount.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.760
It might seem weird that a budget airline would buy brand new airplanes, but the newest

01:39.760 --> 01:43.080
planes are the most efficient which saves fuel.

01:43.080 --> 01:49.520
The fuel efficiency of new aircraft offsets the higher purchase price so EasyJet, JetBlue,

01:49.520 --> 01:55.140
Ryanair, and Spirit Airlines all have younger fleets than any major airline.

01:55.140 --> 01:58.800
Budget airlines will also typically have only one type of plane.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.840
Ryanair only operates 737s and EasyJet only operates the A320 family.

02:04.840 --> 02:09.600
Having only one type of aircraft means that pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, and

02:09.600 --> 02:14.360
ground staff only need to be trained on one type of aircraft which saves an enormous amount

02:14.360 --> 02:16.040
of time and money.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.560
Within the planes, budget airlines will often avoid luxuries to keep costs down.

02:20.560 --> 02:25.320
Ryanair seats, for example, don't recline because that increases the initial purchase

02:25.320 --> 02:28.520
price for seats and also requires more maintenance.

02:28.520 --> 02:33.000
The seat design also saves time for flight attendants since there are no seatback pockets

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
to clean between flights.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.840
Flight attendants on budget airlines are often in the beginning of their careers and receive

02:38.840 --> 02:40.240
little training.

02:40.240 --> 02:44.800
Of course they'll get the required safety training but only minimal hospitality training.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.840
They'll also often serve multiple roles.

02:47.840 --> 02:51.920
While on the ground, some of the flight attendants might go to the gate and check tickets while

02:51.920 --> 02:53.840
others clean the airplane.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.360
Through this, the airline eliminates three or four positions that they would regularly

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
pay for.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.380
On board, flight attendants are of course responsible for food and drinks which are

03:02.380 --> 03:04.280
almost never free.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.960
On board service can be an excellent way for airlines to make money.

03:07.960 --> 03:13.040
Many budget airlines also do duty free sales and Ryanair even sells lottery tickets.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.440
Let's talk airports.

03:14.440 --> 03:18.680
You're never going to see Ryanair fly to London Heathrow or Paris Charles de Gaulle

03:18.680 --> 03:20.880
because those airports are expensive.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.120
There's only a set amount of flights per day that can operate out of them so supply

03:25.120 --> 03:29.520
and demand dictates that landing fees are high and slots are regulated.

03:29.520 --> 03:35.480
Instead, Ryanair flies to Gatwick, Stansted, or Luton in London, or Beauvais in Paris which

03:35.480 --> 03:40.280
by the way, is an 80 minute bus ride away from Paris, isn't technically in the same

03:40.280 --> 03:44.120
region of Paris, and has a website that looks like this.

03:44.120 --> 03:49.160
In a lot of cases, Ryanair or other budget airlines are the only or one of a few airlines

03:49.160 --> 03:53.380
flying out of an airport which gives them huge negotiating power.

03:53.380 --> 03:58.000
Often they will take a small regional airport a ways away from a city and rebrand it as

03:58.000 --> 03:59.840
another city airport.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.520
They can ask for lower landing and takeoff prices and if the airport doesn't comply,

04:04.560 --> 04:08.360
they'll just leave and the airport will essentially cease to exist.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.920
If there isn't a viable, cheap airport available around a city, budget airlines can also fly

04:12.920 --> 04:17.560
to regular airports at less busy times when landing fees and the chance of delay might

04:17.560 --> 04:18.880
be lower.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.920
Now let's get into the nitty gritty.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.780
The planes of budget airlines tend to operate all day, non-stop.

04:25.780 --> 04:31.240
For example, in one day, this Ryanair plane went from Brussels to Copenhagen, Copenhagen

04:31.240 --> 04:37.120
to Brussels, Brussels to Prague, Prague to Brussels, Brussels to Nimes, Nimes to Brussels,

04:37.120 --> 04:41.040
Brussels to Trevioso, then finally Trevioso to Brussels.

04:41.040 --> 04:45.920
Budget airlines will schedule only 30-45 minutes between the landing of one flight and the

04:45.920 --> 04:51.760
takeoff of another which often leads to delays and leaves very little time to clean the aircraft.

04:51.760 --> 04:56.100
This does, however, mean that the airplane is always making money and passengers are

04:56.100 --> 04:58.800
not paying for time it's sitting around.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.880
Ever wonder why Southwest doesn't have reserved seating?

05:01.880 --> 05:06.680
Well by having a first come first serve system for seats, people almost always show up to

05:06.680 --> 05:10.340
the gate early and line up in an orderly line.

05:10.340 --> 05:15.900
This way, less time is spent on the ground boarding and more time in the air flying.

05:15.900 --> 05:19.360
Another principle of budget airlines is the point to point model.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.520
Most traditional airlines have hubs where most or all of their flights go in and out

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
of.

05:24.520 --> 05:29.080
British Airways has London, Air France has Paris, KLM has Amsterdam.

05:29.080 --> 05:33.600
To get to most places on these airlines, you have to connect through their hubs.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.140
Budget airlines, on the other hand, try to have a lot of destinations from everywhere.

05:38.140 --> 05:43.440
That does mean, however, that many destinations are served only a few times per week.

05:43.440 --> 05:47.640
The cheapest budget airlines don't even allow for connections between their flights.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.840
Allowing connections adds cost because then you have to pay for ground crews to transfer

05:51.840 --> 05:56.360
bags, create a more complicated ticketing system, and pay to rebook a passenger if a

05:56.360 --> 05:59.320
delay in their first flight makes them miss their second.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.520
Speaking of ticketing, there's often no way to get a ticket from a real person on

06:03.520 --> 06:04.640
budget airlines.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.800
Ryanair charges 45 pounds if you fail to print your ticket at home and EasyJet and some other

06:09.800 --> 06:13.680
carriers have almost all their check-ins handled by machines.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.320
This, once again, cuts down on personnel costs.

06:17.320 --> 06:22.200
At the airport, these budget airlines won't bother using jetways because they're expensive.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.680
They'll use steps and just have passengers walk across the tarmac or take a bus to the

06:26.680 --> 06:28.400
plane.

06:28.400 --> 06:32.040
Budget airlines make a lot of money, if done right.

06:32.040 --> 06:38.520
EasyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air all have higher profit margins than Lufthansa, British Airways,

06:38.520 --> 06:39.860
and Air France.

06:39.860 --> 06:44.240
Many of the traditional airlines have unionized workers with salary agreements that cannot

06:44.240 --> 06:48.840
be changed, while budget airlines can hire anyone and train them in a few months.

06:48.840 --> 06:52.360
It's also hard for these traditional airlines to grow.

06:52.360 --> 06:56.600
Any route they make has to be one with a lot of pre-existing demand since much of their

06:56.600 --> 06:59.400
business comes from business travelers.

06:59.400 --> 07:04.120
Since budget airlines are targeted more towards tourists, any destination that Ryanair, for

07:04.120 --> 07:09.000
example, opens up in will become a popular destination just because it's possible to

07:09.000 --> 07:10.860
get there for so cheap.

07:10.860 --> 07:15.060
Some traditional airlines in Europe are opening their own budget airlines to get in on this

07:15.060 --> 07:16.060
profit.

07:16.060 --> 07:20.780
Air France created Transavia and Lufthansa created Eurowings, both of which are losing

07:20.780 --> 07:22.760
massive amounts of money.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.660
What they seem to forget is that the US went through this budget airline within an airline

07:26.660 --> 07:33.260
phase a couple decades ago, Delta created Song, which failed, US Airways created Metrojet,

07:33.260 --> 07:38.260
which failed, United created Shuttle, which failed, then they went into bankruptcy and

07:38.260 --> 07:41.960
decided that they should try again and make Ted, which failed.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.220
None of these worked.

07:43.220 --> 07:47.720
The reason Ryanair and EasyJet are able to succeed where others have failed is largely

07:47.720 --> 07:50.180
because they are so large and flexible.

07:50.180 --> 07:55.220
They have hundreds of planes, hundreds of destinations, thousands of employees, and

07:55.220 --> 07:59.180
negotiating power that allows them to overpower competitors.

07:59.180 --> 08:04.140
In the end, for us consumers, any competition is good competition.

08:04.140 --> 08:07.940
Even failing budget airlines will bring down the cost of traditional airlines and allow

08:07.940 --> 08:10.540
us to travel the world for less.

08:10.540 --> 08:11.540
