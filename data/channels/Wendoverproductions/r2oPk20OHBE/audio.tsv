9600	12880	documentary called, The Final Years of Majuro.
12880	18960	Out of the myriad problems that emerged in the world in spring 2020, there is one that
18960	24520	is quietly being solved—one that has to do with the behind-the-scenes of a globalized
24520	27120	modern-day economy.
27120	28660	Understanding it is easy.
28660	32860	At its core, it's a simple supply and demand mismatch.
32860	39280	You see, back in March 2020, when COVID-19 reached pandemic status, almost every airline
39280	42700	in the world drastically scaled back its flying.
42700	47180	It varied from region to region and airline to airline, but the one common trend everywhere
47180	52420	was that, if any route got cut, it was almost certainly a long-haul one.
52420	58200	In the era of quarantine periods, border closings, and other travel restrictions, there is near-zero
58200	64100	demand for long-haul international travel so intercontinental flights were quickly removed
64100	65900	from airline schedules.
65900	71680	For example, in April 2019, about 500 round-trip flights per day would fly between Europe and
71680	78200	the US, however, in April 2020, that number was reduced to about 80 per day.
78200	82420	That represents between an 80 and 90% reduction.
82420	87180	Ignoring airline revenue, you'd think that that would be a loss-free situation, though—it
87180	91300	reduces carbon emissions, many governments are covering the salaries of furloughed workers,
91300	96060	it reduces airline expenditure, and nobody's riding in the cabins anyways, but that doesn't
96060	98600	consider what rides below the cabin.
98600	103380	On nearly every intercontinental flight, in the bellyhold, among the hundreds of passenger
103380	105640	bags, there is cargo.
105640	111100	In fact, 45% of the world's air cargo is carried in this method.
111100	116140	Now, the math to explain the supply and demand mismatch is simple.
116140	120780	The proportion of cargo carried on passenger aircraft varies from route to route, so 60%
120780	125140	of Western Europe to US air cargo, for example, flies on passenger planes.
125140	130740	80-90% of transatlantic passenger flights are not flying, which means that about 50%
130740	135920	of air cargo capacity in this market has disappeared in a matter of weeks.
135920	141540	The situation is less severe in other markets, but, industry-wide, the overall air cargo
141540	145660	capacity reduction was about 23% in March 2020.
145660	150860	So, that's the supply figure, but what about demand?
150860	155980	As a huge proportion of the world entered various lockdown scenarios, economic forecasts
155980	157140	plummeted.
157140	161420	The extent of the financial toll will not be clear for a while, but it is clear that
161420	163600	it is deeply negative.
163600	166880	This all has an effect on air cargo demand.
166880	171380	On a macro level, consumers are buying less, which means less is shipped, which means companies
171380	175940	are buying less, which means less is shipped, which means suppliers are making less, which
175940	177580	means less is shipped.
177580	181980	On a micro level, different jurisdictions worldwide differ on the exact details of their
181980	186820	coronavirus response, but in many places, factories are shut down, which means supply
186820	188420	chains are cut.
188420	192900	So, from an economic perspective, one would predict that demand would almost certainly
192900	200420	be down, but like all things in the age of coronavirus, there is another dominant perspective—that
200460	202540	of public health.
202540	207660	From almost the moment COVID-19 emerged, it became clear that it was a highly infectious
207660	212620	virus, which means that a crucial component of the safe treatment of an infected individual
212620	217300	is the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE.
217300	222360	In this context, that means masks, shields, gowns, and more, which healthcare facilities
222360	227460	always stock, but never in the quantity needed to cover nearly universal staff usage for
227460	228900	a long period.
228900	233900	That means that, in order to reduce the risk of staff exposure, nearly every hospital in
233900	236860	the world needed more PPE.
236860	242140	Purely by chance, it turns out that the number one medical PPE-producing country in the world
242140	246520	was also the first country to experience COVID-19—China.
246520	251020	Before the pandemic, the country produced 20 million medical masks per day, or about
251020	253160	half of the world's supply.
253160	257900	By the beginning of March, though, this had already been scaled up to more than 100 million
257900	258900	per day.
258900	263700	It was at exactly this time when, simultaneously, China's manufacturing industry started to
263700	268380	inch back to life and the virus truly took hold of the rest of the world.
268380	274100	With how fast COVID-19 ramped up, many hospitals in hotspots like Italy, Spain, and the US
274100	279820	were reusing masks and, even with that technique, were down to only days of supply so they needed
279820	284620	supply from China and other manufacturing hubs as fast as possible.
284620	289860	In the logistics world, as fast as possible means air cargo.
289860	294860	Thanks to this unprecedented and urgent demand for PPE and other medical supplies, demand
294860	299060	for air cargo only dropped by 15% in March, 2020.
299060	305420	Considering air cargo capacity dropped by 23%, that means that there was an 8% gap between
305420	307240	supply and demand.
307240	313300	In the context of this enormous industry, 8% is huge and so the laws of supply and demand
313300	315120	followed their course.
315120	320340	The cost to transport goods by air spiked, especially in the crucial Asia to US and Europe
320340	321540	markets.
321540	326060	In the last two weeks of March, air cargo rates from Hong Kong to North America jumped
326060	331780	27% above normal while rates from Shanghai to Europe increased by 50%.
331780	337380	Of course, after a supply and demand mismatch, economic forces pushed companies to increase
337380	340680	supply, which is exactly what happened.
340680	344240	Through airlines that could massively ramp up their flights.
344240	349120	Calida Air, for example, an American cargo airline, brought some aircraft out of storage
349120	352320	and increased its long-haul flying by nearly 50%.
352320	356720	However, there is only so much that these cargo airlines can do.
356720	361860	They only have so many aircraft, so many pilots, and so many mechanics so they can't massively
361860	364640	ramp up their operations in a short time.
364640	370560	Who did have extra capacity, though, were passenger airlines and that were a small solution
370560	371660	emerged.
371660	376220	A plane with no passengers is not necessarily an empty plane.
376220	381440	An average airline earns 15-20% of its revenue through cargo, but keep in mind what an average
381440	382940	airline looks like.
382940	386680	Most of the average North American airlines is flying is domestic and short-haul, where
386680	390920	little cargo is carried, so the proportion of revenue coming from cargo on a long-haul
390920	393220	flight is far higher.
393220	397800	Consider too that, on a normal long-haul passenger flight, a considerable portion of the cargo
397800	403420	hold is filled with baggage, so that 15-20% is derived from only some of the capacity
403420	406060	on only some flights.
406060	411740	Airlines soon realized that there was a possibility of turning a profit flying a passenger plane
411740	413280	with no passengers.
413280	421060	Now, normally, a passenger A330, for example, has capacity for 38,000 pounds or 17,000 kilograms
421060	423160	of cargo in its belly hold.
423160	428480	That's compared to the freighter version of the A330 which can carry 132,000 pounds
428480	433180	or 60,000 kilograms of freight thanks to its completely empty cabin.
433180	439620	That means that the passenger A330 can only carry 29% as much cargo as its freighter counterpart.
439620	445060	However, considering that freight rates have risen by as much as 50%, that means that flying
445060	449420	these aircraft can earn about 44% as much per flight as their freighter counterparts
449420	450980	normally do.
451120	455920	Making less than half as much as cargo airlines clearly would not make flying passenger aircraft
455920	459920	for cargo purposes worth it, but there is more to consider.
459920	466040	First, jet fuel prices are at an all-time low, largely in response to all-time low demand.
466040	472080	The same gallon that would have cost airlines $2.20 in January 2020 costs about 40 cents
472080	476420	in late April 2020, and those prices are continuing to drop.
476420	481440	In normal conditions, fuel is airlines' number one cost so having that drop by a factor
481440	485500	of five reduces the cost to operate a flight dramatically.
485500	489920	That means that they need to earn far less than what a cargo airline does in normal conditions
489920	490920	to break even.
490920	494960	In addition, most airlines are paying their pilots and staff anyways.
494960	498900	In the US, for example, airlines are required, as a condition of their government relief
498900	504000	funding, to not lay off or furlough any staff, so the marginal staffing cost to operate an
504000	506040	additional flight is minimal.
506040	511520	Thirdly, with no passengers, airlines have quickly innovated new ways to carry cargo.
511520	515380	Many airlines have loaded their passenger cabins with cargo placed directly on top of
515380	517340	and fastened to seats.
517340	522260	This dramatically increases complexity and loading time, but it also dramatically increases
522260	523540	capacity.
523540	527520	All of these conditions and circumstances combine to the point that, for this brief
527520	532880	moment in time, economics dictate that an airline can turn a profit flying a passenger
532880	535400	plane without passengers.
535400	540780	Big airlines like American Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air New Zealand began cargo-only
540780	545780	flights, so many, in fact, that united airlines, for example, had up to dozens of passenger-less
545780	549940	passenger planes airborne at the same time all around the world.
549940	554840	This also created flights that have never happened before, like a 16-hour non-stop cargo-only
554840	557940	trip from Sydney to Toronto by Air Canada.
557940	563140	But it wasn't all just big airlines on long flights—smaller airlines, too, got in on
563140	564140	the game.
564140	568720	After Greenland started a link on a tiny propeller Dash 8 to transport coronavirus tests for
568720	573080	processing in a Danish lab, Titan Airways flew medical supplies to the remote island
573080	578940	of St Helena on a passenger A318, and Wizz Air flew their passenger A321s to Shanghai
578940	582480	via Kazakhstan to transport medical supplies to Hungary.
582480	588000	These circumstances have also led to a dramatic reshuffling of rank and order in the aviation
588000	589000	world.
589000	593080	The list of the world's busiest airports, in terms of annual aircraft movements, is
593080	597900	normally headed by Atlanta, followed by Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Beijing, and a number
597900	600020	of other major hub airports.
600020	604560	Normally, you wouldn't expect an airport from America's third least populous state
604560	610520	anywhere on the first pages of that list, however, for a brief moment in April, 2020,
610520	612060	that was the case.
612060	618220	Anchorage Airport, in Alaska, became the world's busiest airport thanks to its strategic location.
618220	622840	It has long been a busy cargo airport as it acts as a stopover point for cargo flights
622840	624580	from Asia to North America.
624580	628580	They stop here because it is more efficient for aircraft, on long-haul flights, to take
628580	633740	less fuel and more cargo and refuel halfway through than fly non-stop to their destination.
633740	638860	Also, in some cases, freight is sorted and exchanged between aircraft in Anchorage.
638860	644880	In April, 2020, the US ranked number one in the world for new and total coronavirus cases
644880	649900	so it had a tremendous need for medical supplies which are overwhelmingly produced in Asia
649900	654340	so hundreds of cargo aircraft per day passed through Anchorage on their way between Asia
654340	655700	and the US.
655700	661300	So, while every other major airport in the US fell into relative silence, Anchorage was
661300	663340	busier than ever.
663340	668700	There is, however, one final issue that the air cargo world is facing.
668700	674780	Beyond the short-term issue of too much demand, the long-term issue is that this demand will
674780	676900	not last.
676900	681060	Global air cargo demand closely tracks with global economic health.
681060	685660	Every indicator suggests that the economy will not emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic
685660	690780	even close to as strong as when it entered, so there will undoubtedly be some slow months
690780	692860	and years for air cargo.
692860	697140	Once urgent demand for medical supplies eases, and buyers have the time to switch to slower
697140	702740	forms of shipping, the air cargo world will almost certainly follow the fate of its passenger-carrying
702740	705100	colleagues.
705100	710260	On the exact same day as this video goes out, we released a brand new hour-long documentary
710260	712740	called The Final Years of Majuro.
712740	718300	It's about the isolated nation of the Marshall Islands and, specifically, what life is like
718300	723320	when you know your nation is coming to an end—when where you live has an expiration
723320	724340	date.
724340	729780	This project is available exclusively on Nebula—the streaming site home to loads of educational
729780	732180	creators' big, ambitious projects.
732260	737260	Now, the best way to get access to Nebula is through CuriosityStream's bundle deal.

756020	760420	This new documentary was a huge project where we flew a crew to the other side of the world
760460	764940	and worked with a large team for months in post-production, and it was only made possible
764940	768780	thanks to CuriosityStream, Nebula, and your subscriptions to them.
