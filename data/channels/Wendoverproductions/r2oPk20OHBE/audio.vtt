00:09.600 --> 00:12.880
documentary called, The Final Years of Majuro.

00:12.880 --> 00:18.960
Out of the myriad problems that emerged in the world in spring 2020, there is one that

00:18.960 --> 00:24.520
is quietly being solved—one that has to do with the behind-the-scenes of a globalized

00:24.520 --> 00:27.120
modern-day economy.

00:27.120 --> 00:28.660
Understanding it is easy.

00:28.660 --> 00:32.860
At its core, it's a simple supply and demand mismatch.

00:32.860 --> 00:39.280
You see, back in March 2020, when COVID-19 reached pandemic status, almost every airline

00:39.280 --> 00:42.700
in the world drastically scaled back its flying.

00:42.700 --> 00:47.180
It varied from region to region and airline to airline, but the one common trend everywhere

00:47.180 --> 00:52.420
was that, if any route got cut, it was almost certainly a long-haul one.

00:52.420 --> 00:58.200
In the era of quarantine periods, border closings, and other travel restrictions, there is near-zero

00:58.200 --> 01:04.100
demand for long-haul international travel so intercontinental flights were quickly removed

01:04.100 --> 01:05.900
from airline schedules.

01:05.900 --> 01:11.680
For example, in April 2019, about 500 round-trip flights per day would fly between Europe and

01:11.680 --> 01:18.200
the US, however, in April 2020, that number was reduced to about 80 per day.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.420
That represents between an 80 and 90% reduction.

01:22.420 --> 01:27.180
Ignoring airline revenue, you'd think that that would be a loss-free situation, though—it

01:27.180 --> 01:31.300
reduces carbon emissions, many governments are covering the salaries of furloughed workers,

01:31.300 --> 01:36.060
it reduces airline expenditure, and nobody's riding in the cabins anyways, but that doesn't

01:36.060 --> 01:38.600
consider what rides below the cabin.

01:38.600 --> 01:43.380
On nearly every intercontinental flight, in the bellyhold, among the hundreds of passenger

01:43.380 --> 01:45.640
bags, there is cargo.

01:45.640 --> 01:51.100
In fact, 45% of the world's air cargo is carried in this method.

01:51.100 --> 01:56.140
Now, the math to explain the supply and demand mismatch is simple.

01:56.140 --> 02:00.780
The proportion of cargo carried on passenger aircraft varies from route to route, so 60%

02:00.780 --> 02:05.140
of Western Europe to US air cargo, for example, flies on passenger planes.

02:05.140 --> 02:10.740
80-90% of transatlantic passenger flights are not flying, which means that about 50%

02:10.740 --> 02:15.920
of air cargo capacity in this market has disappeared in a matter of weeks.

02:15.920 --> 02:21.540
The situation is less severe in other markets, but, industry-wide, the overall air cargo

02:21.540 --> 02:25.660
capacity reduction was about 23% in March 2020.

02:25.660 --> 02:30.860
So, that's the supply figure, but what about demand?

02:30.860 --> 02:35.980
As a huge proportion of the world entered various lockdown scenarios, economic forecasts

02:35.980 --> 02:37.140
plummeted.

02:37.140 --> 02:41.420
The extent of the financial toll will not be clear for a while, but it is clear that

02:41.420 --> 02:43.600
it is deeply negative.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.880
This all has an effect on air cargo demand.

02:46.880 --> 02:51.380
On a macro level, consumers are buying less, which means less is shipped, which means companies

02:51.380 --> 02:55.940
are buying less, which means less is shipped, which means suppliers are making less, which

02:55.940 --> 02:57.580
means less is shipped.

02:57.580 --> 03:01.980
On a micro level, different jurisdictions worldwide differ on the exact details of their

03:01.980 --> 03:06.820
coronavirus response, but in many places, factories are shut down, which means supply

03:06.820 --> 03:08.420
chains are cut.

03:08.420 --> 03:12.900
So, from an economic perspective, one would predict that demand would almost certainly

03:12.900 --> 03:20.420
be down, but like all things in the age of coronavirus, there is another dominant perspective—that

03:20.460 --> 03:22.540
of public health.

03:22.540 --> 03:27.660
From almost the moment COVID-19 emerged, it became clear that it was a highly infectious

03:27.660 --> 03:32.620
virus, which means that a crucial component of the safe treatment of an infected individual

03:32.620 --> 03:37.300
is the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE.

03:37.300 --> 03:42.360
In this context, that means masks, shields, gowns, and more, which healthcare facilities

03:42.360 --> 03:47.460
always stock, but never in the quantity needed to cover nearly universal staff usage for

03:47.460 --> 03:48.900
a long period.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.900
That means that, in order to reduce the risk of staff exposure, nearly every hospital in

03:53.900 --> 03:56.860
the world needed more PPE.

03:56.860 --> 04:02.140
Purely by chance, it turns out that the number one medical PPE-producing country in the world

04:02.140 --> 04:06.520
was also the first country to experience COVID-19—China.

04:06.520 --> 04:11.020
Before the pandemic, the country produced 20 million medical masks per day, or about

04:11.020 --> 04:13.160
half of the world's supply.

04:13.160 --> 04:17.900
By the beginning of March, though, this had already been scaled up to more than 100 million

04:17.900 --> 04:18.900
per day.

04:18.900 --> 04:23.700
It was at exactly this time when, simultaneously, China's manufacturing industry started to

04:23.700 --> 04:28.380
inch back to life and the virus truly took hold of the rest of the world.

04:28.380 --> 04:34.100
With how fast COVID-19 ramped up, many hospitals in hotspots like Italy, Spain, and the US

04:34.100 --> 04:39.820
were reusing masks and, even with that technique, were down to only days of supply so they needed

04:39.820 --> 04:44.620
supply from China and other manufacturing hubs as fast as possible.

04:44.620 --> 04:49.860
In the logistics world, as fast as possible means air cargo.

04:49.860 --> 04:54.860
Thanks to this unprecedented and urgent demand for PPE and other medical supplies, demand

04:54.860 --> 04:59.060
for air cargo only dropped by 15% in March, 2020.

04:59.060 --> 05:05.420
Considering air cargo capacity dropped by 23%, that means that there was an 8% gap between

05:05.420 --> 05:07.240
supply and demand.

05:07.240 --> 05:13.300
In the context of this enormous industry, 8% is huge and so the laws of supply and demand

05:13.300 --> 05:15.120
followed their course.

05:15.120 --> 05:20.340
The cost to transport goods by air spiked, especially in the crucial Asia to US and Europe

05:20.340 --> 05:21.540
markets.

05:21.540 --> 05:26.060
In the last two weeks of March, air cargo rates from Hong Kong to North America jumped

05:26.060 --> 05:31.780
27% above normal while rates from Shanghai to Europe increased by 50%.

05:31.780 --> 05:37.380
Of course, after a supply and demand mismatch, economic forces pushed companies to increase

05:37.380 --> 05:40.680
supply, which is exactly what happened.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.240
Through airlines that could massively ramp up their flights.

05:44.240 --> 05:49.120
Calida Air, for example, an American cargo airline, brought some aircraft out of storage

05:49.120 --> 05:52.320
and increased its long-haul flying by nearly 50%.

05:52.320 --> 05:56.720
However, there is only so much that these cargo airlines can do.

05:56.720 --> 06:01.860
They only have so many aircraft, so many pilots, and so many mechanics so they can't massively

06:01.860 --> 06:04.640
ramp up their operations in a short time.

06:04.640 --> 06:10.560
Who did have extra capacity, though, were passenger airlines and that were a small solution

06:10.560 --> 06:11.660
emerged.

06:11.660 --> 06:16.220
A plane with no passengers is not necessarily an empty plane.

06:16.220 --> 06:21.440
An average airline earns 15-20% of its revenue through cargo, but keep in mind what an average

06:21.440 --> 06:22.940
airline looks like.

06:22.940 --> 06:26.680
Most of the average North American airlines is flying is domestic and short-haul, where

06:26.680 --> 06:30.920
little cargo is carried, so the proportion of revenue coming from cargo on a long-haul

06:30.920 --> 06:33.220
flight is far higher.

06:33.220 --> 06:37.800
Consider too that, on a normal long-haul passenger flight, a considerable portion of the cargo

06:37.800 --> 06:43.420
hold is filled with baggage, so that 15-20% is derived from only some of the capacity

06:43.420 --> 06:46.060
on only some flights.

06:46.060 --> 06:51.740
Airlines soon realized that there was a possibility of turning a profit flying a passenger plane

06:51.740 --> 06:53.280
with no passengers.

06:53.280 --> 07:01.060
Now, normally, a passenger A330, for example, has capacity for 38,000 pounds or 17,000 kilograms

07:01.060 --> 07:03.160
of cargo in its belly hold.

07:03.160 --> 07:08.480
That's compared to the freighter version of the A330 which can carry 132,000 pounds

07:08.480 --> 07:13.180
or 60,000 kilograms of freight thanks to its completely empty cabin.

07:13.180 --> 07:19.620
That means that the passenger A330 can only carry 29% as much cargo as its freighter counterpart.

07:19.620 --> 07:25.060
However, considering that freight rates have risen by as much as 50%, that means that flying

07:25.060 --> 07:29.420
these aircraft can earn about 44% as much per flight as their freighter counterparts

07:29.420 --> 07:30.980
normally do.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.920
Making less than half as much as cargo airlines clearly would not make flying passenger aircraft

07:35.920 --> 07:39.920
for cargo purposes worth it, but there is more to consider.

07:39.920 --> 07:46.040
First, jet fuel prices are at an all-time low, largely in response to all-time low demand.

07:46.040 --> 07:52.080
The same gallon that would have cost airlines $2.20 in January 2020 costs about 40 cents

07:52.080 --> 07:56.420
in late April 2020, and those prices are continuing to drop.

07:56.420 --> 08:01.440
In normal conditions, fuel is airlines' number one cost so having that drop by a factor

08:01.440 --> 08:05.500
of five reduces the cost to operate a flight dramatically.

08:05.500 --> 08:09.920
That means that they need to earn far less than what a cargo airline does in normal conditions

08:09.920 --> 08:10.920
to break even.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.960
In addition, most airlines are paying their pilots and staff anyways.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.900
In the US, for example, airlines are required, as a condition of their government relief

08:18.900 --> 08:24.000
funding, to not lay off or furlough any staff, so the marginal staffing cost to operate an

08:24.000 --> 08:26.040
additional flight is minimal.

08:26.040 --> 08:31.520
Thirdly, with no passengers, airlines have quickly innovated new ways to carry cargo.

08:31.520 --> 08:35.380
Many airlines have loaded their passenger cabins with cargo placed directly on top of

08:35.380 --> 08:37.340
and fastened to seats.

08:37.340 --> 08:42.260
This dramatically increases complexity and loading time, but it also dramatically increases

08:42.260 --> 08:43.540
capacity.

08:43.540 --> 08:47.520
All of these conditions and circumstances combine to the point that, for this brief

08:47.520 --> 08:52.880
moment in time, economics dictate that an airline can turn a profit flying a passenger

08:52.880 --> 08:55.400
plane without passengers.

08:55.400 --> 09:00.780
Big airlines like American Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air New Zealand began cargo-only

09:00.780 --> 09:05.780
flights, so many, in fact, that united airlines, for example, had up to dozens of passenger-less

09:05.780 --> 09:09.940
passenger planes airborne at the same time all around the world.

09:09.940 --> 09:14.840
This also created flights that have never happened before, like a 16-hour non-stop cargo-only

09:14.840 --> 09:17.940
trip from Sydney to Toronto by Air Canada.

09:17.940 --> 09:23.140
But it wasn't all just big airlines on long flights—smaller airlines, too, got in on

09:23.140 --> 09:24.140
the game.

09:24.140 --> 09:28.720
After Greenland started a link on a tiny propeller Dash 8 to transport coronavirus tests for

09:28.720 --> 09:33.080
processing in a Danish lab, Titan Airways flew medical supplies to the remote island

09:33.080 --> 09:38.940
of St Helena on a passenger A318, and Wizz Air flew their passenger A321s to Shanghai

09:38.940 --> 09:42.480
via Kazakhstan to transport medical supplies to Hungary.

09:42.480 --> 09:48.000
These circumstances have also led to a dramatic reshuffling of rank and order in the aviation

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
world.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.080
The list of the world's busiest airports, in terms of annual aircraft movements, is

09:53.080 --> 09:57.900
normally headed by Atlanta, followed by Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Beijing, and a number

09:57.900 --> 10:00.020
of other major hub airports.

10:00.020 --> 10:04.560
Normally, you wouldn't expect an airport from America's third least populous state

10:04.560 --> 10:10.520
anywhere on the first pages of that list, however, for a brief moment in April, 2020,

10:10.520 --> 10:12.060
that was the case.

10:12.060 --> 10:18.220
Anchorage Airport, in Alaska, became the world's busiest airport thanks to its strategic location.

10:18.220 --> 10:22.840
It has long been a busy cargo airport as it acts as a stopover point for cargo flights

10:22.840 --> 10:24.580
from Asia to North America.

10:24.580 --> 10:28.580
They stop here because it is more efficient for aircraft, on long-haul flights, to take

10:28.580 --> 10:33.740
less fuel and more cargo and refuel halfway through than fly non-stop to their destination.

10:33.740 --> 10:38.860
Also, in some cases, freight is sorted and exchanged between aircraft in Anchorage.

10:38.860 --> 10:44.880
In April, 2020, the US ranked number one in the world for new and total coronavirus cases

10:44.880 --> 10:49.900
so it had a tremendous need for medical supplies which are overwhelmingly produced in Asia

10:49.900 --> 10:54.340
so hundreds of cargo aircraft per day passed through Anchorage on their way between Asia

10:54.340 --> 10:55.700
and the US.

10:55.700 --> 11:01.300
So, while every other major airport in the US fell into relative silence, Anchorage was

11:01.300 --> 11:03.340
busier than ever.

11:03.340 --> 11:08.700
There is, however, one final issue that the air cargo world is facing.

11:08.700 --> 11:14.780
Beyond the short-term issue of too much demand, the long-term issue is that this demand will

11:14.780 --> 11:16.900
not last.

11:16.900 --> 11:21.060
Global air cargo demand closely tracks with global economic health.

11:21.060 --> 11:25.660
Every indicator suggests that the economy will not emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic

11:25.660 --> 11:30.780
even close to as strong as when it entered, so there will undoubtedly be some slow months

11:30.780 --> 11:32.860
and years for air cargo.

11:32.860 --> 11:37.140
Once urgent demand for medical supplies eases, and buyers have the time to switch to slower

11:37.140 --> 11:42.740
forms of shipping, the air cargo world will almost certainly follow the fate of its passenger-carrying

11:42.740 --> 11:45.100
colleagues.

11:45.100 --> 11:50.260
On the exact same day as this video goes out, we released a brand new hour-long documentary

11:50.260 --> 11:52.740
called The Final Years of Majuro.

11:52.740 --> 11:58.300
It's about the isolated nation of the Marshall Islands and, specifically, what life is like

11:58.300 --> 12:03.320
when you know your nation is coming to an end—when where you live has an expiration

12:03.320 --> 12:04.340
date.

12:04.340 --> 12:09.780
This project is available exclusively on Nebula—the streaming site home to loads of educational

12:09.780 --> 12:12.180
creators' big, ambitious projects.

12:12.260 --> 12:17.260
Now, the best way to get access to Nebula is through CuriosityStream's bundle deal.

12:17.260 --> 12:22.540

12:22.540 --> 12:28.060
get free access to Nebula, but the best deal is absolutely their annual subscription as,

12:28.060 --> 12:32.780
for a limited time, it's available for 40% off meaning both CuriosityStream and Nebula

12:32.780 --> 12:36.020
combined are just $12 a year.

12:36.020 --> 12:40.420
This new documentary was a huge project where we flew a crew to the other side of the world

12:40.460 --> 12:44.940
and worked with a large team for months in post-production, and it was only made possible

12:44.940 --> 12:48.780
thanks to CuriosityStream, Nebula, and your subscriptions to them.
