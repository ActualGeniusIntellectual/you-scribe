4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,960
Out of the myriad problems that emerged in the world in spring 2020, there is one that

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,520
is quietly being solved—one that has to do with the behind-the-scenes of a globalized

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,120
modern-day economy.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,660
Understanding it is easy.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,860
At its core, it's a simple supply and demand mismatch.

9
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:39,280
You see, back in March 2020, when COVID-19 reached pandemic status, almost every airline

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,700
in the world drastically scaled back its flying.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,180
It varied from region to region and airline to airline, but the one common trend everywhere

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:52,420
was that, if any route got cut, it was almost certainly a long-haul one.

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,200
In the era of quarantine periods, border closings, and other travel restrictions, there is near-zero

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,100
demand for long-haul international travel so intercontinental flights were quickly removed

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,900
from airline schedules.

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,680
For example, in April 2019, about 500 round-trip flights per day would fly between Europe and

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,200
the US, however, in April 2020, that number was reduced to about 80 per day.

18
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,420
That represents between an 80 and 90% reduction.

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,180
Ignoring airline revenue, you'd think that that would be a loss-free situation, though—it

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,300
reduces carbon emissions, many governments are covering the salaries of furloughed workers,

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,060
it reduces airline expenditure, and nobody's riding in the cabins anyways, but that doesn't

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,600
consider what rides below the cabin.

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,380
On nearly every intercontinental flight, in the bellyhold, among the hundreds of passenger

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,640
bags, there is cargo.

25
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:51,100
In fact, 45% of the world's air cargo is carried in this method.

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,140
Now, the math to explain the supply and demand mismatch is simple.

27
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,780
The proportion of cargo carried on passenger aircraft varies from route to route, so 60%

28
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,140
of Western Europe to US air cargo, for example, flies on passenger planes.

29
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,740
80-90% of transatlantic passenger flights are not flying, which means that about 50%

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,920
of air cargo capacity in this market has disappeared in a matter of weeks.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,540
The situation is less severe in other markets, but, industry-wide, the overall air cargo

32
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,660
capacity reduction was about 23% in March 2020.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,860
So, that's the supply figure, but what about demand?

34
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,980
As a huge proportion of the world entered various lockdown scenarios, economic forecasts

35
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,140
plummeted.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,420
The extent of the financial toll will not be clear for a while, but it is clear that

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,600
it is deeply negative.

38
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,880
This all has an effect on air cargo demand.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,380
On a macro level, consumers are buying less, which means less is shipped, which means companies

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,940
are buying less, which means less is shipped, which means suppliers are making less, which

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,580
means less is shipped.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,980
On a micro level, different jurisdictions worldwide differ on the exact details of their

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,820
coronavirus response, but in many places, factories are shut down, which means supply

44
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,420
chains are cut.

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,900
So, from an economic perspective, one would predict that demand would almost certainly

46
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,420
be down, but like all things in the age of coronavirus, there is another dominant perspective—that

47
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,540
of public health.

48
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,660
From almost the moment COVID-19 emerged, it became clear that it was a highly infectious

49
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,620
virus, which means that a crucial component of the safe treatment of an infected individual

50
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,300
is the use of personal protective equipment, or PPE.

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,360
In this context, that means masks, shields, gowns, and more, which healthcare facilities

52
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,460
always stock, but never in the quantity needed to cover nearly universal staff usage for

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,900
a long period.

54
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,900
That means that, in order to reduce the risk of staff exposure, nearly every hospital in

55
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,860
the world needed more PPE.

56
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,140
Purely by chance, it turns out that the number one medical PPE-producing country in the world

57
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,520
was also the first country to experience COVID-19—China.

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:11,020
Before the pandemic, the country produced 20 million medical masks per day, or about

59
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,160
half of the world's supply.

60
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,900
By the beginning of March, though, this had already been scaled up to more than 100 million

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
per day.

62
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,700
It was at exactly this time when, simultaneously, China's manufacturing industry started to

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:28,380
inch back to life and the virus truly took hold of the rest of the world.

64
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,100
With how fast COVID-19 ramped up, many hospitals in hotspots like Italy, Spain, and the US

65
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,820
were reusing masks and, even with that technique, were down to only days of supply so they needed

66
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,620
supply from China and other manufacturing hubs as fast as possible.

67
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,860
In the logistics world, as fast as possible means air cargo.

68
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Thanks to this unprecedented and urgent demand for PPE and other medical supplies, demand

69
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,060
for air cargo only dropped by 15% in March, 2020.

70
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,420
Considering air cargo capacity dropped by 23%, that means that there was an 8% gap between

71
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,240
supply and demand.

72
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,300
In the context of this enormous industry, 8% is huge and so the laws of supply and demand

73
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,120
followed their course.

74
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,340
The cost to transport goods by air spiked, especially in the crucial Asia to US and Europe

75
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,540
markets.

76
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,060
In the last two weeks of March, air cargo rates from Hong Kong to North America jumped

77
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,780
27% above normal while rates from Shanghai to Europe increased by 50%.

78
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,380
Of course, after a supply and demand mismatch, economic forces pushed companies to increase

79
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,680
supply, which is exactly what happened.

80
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,240
Through airlines that could massively ramp up their flights.

81
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,120
Calida Air, for example, an American cargo airline, brought some aircraft out of storage

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,320
and increased its long-haul flying by nearly 50%.

83
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,720
However, there is only so much that these cargo airlines can do.

84
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,860
They only have so many aircraft, so many pilots, and so many mechanics so they can't massively

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,640
ramp up their operations in a short time.

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,560
Who did have extra capacity, though, were passenger airlines and that were a small solution

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,660
emerged.

88
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:16,220
A plane with no passengers is not necessarily an empty plane.

89
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:21,440
An average airline earns 15-20% of its revenue through cargo, but keep in mind what an average

90
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,940
airline looks like.

91
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,680
Most of the average North American airlines is flying is domestic and short-haul, where

92
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,920
little cargo is carried, so the proportion of revenue coming from cargo on a long-haul

93
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,220
flight is far higher.

94
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,800
Consider too that, on a normal long-haul passenger flight, a considerable portion of the cargo

95
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,420
hold is filled with baggage, so that 15-20% is derived from only some of the capacity

96
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,060
on only some flights.

97
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,740
Airlines soon realized that there was a possibility of turning a profit flying a passenger plane

98
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,280
with no passengers.

99
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:01,060
Now, normally, a passenger A330, for example, has capacity for 38,000 pounds or 17,000 kilograms

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,160
of cargo in its belly hold.

101
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,480
That's compared to the freighter version of the A330 which can carry 132,000 pounds

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,180
or 60,000 kilograms of freight thanks to its completely empty cabin.

103
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,620
That means that the passenger A330 can only carry 29% as much cargo as its freighter counterpart.

104
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:25,060
However, considering that freight rates have risen by as much as 50%, that means that flying

105
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,420
these aircraft can earn about 44% as much per flight as their freighter counterparts

106
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,980
normally do.

107
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,920
Making less than half as much as cargo airlines clearly would not make flying passenger aircraft

108
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,920
for cargo purposes worth it, but there is more to consider.

109
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:46,040
First, jet fuel prices are at an all-time low, largely in response to all-time low demand.

110
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:52,080
The same gallon that would have cost airlines $2.20 in January 2020 costs about 40 cents

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,420
in late April 2020, and those prices are continuing to drop.

112
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,440
In normal conditions, fuel is airlines' number one cost so having that drop by a factor

113
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,500
of five reduces the cost to operate a flight dramatically.

114
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,920
That means that they need to earn far less than what a cargo airline does in normal conditions

115
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
to break even.

116
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,960
In addition, most airlines are paying their pilots and staff anyways.

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,900
In the US, for example, airlines are required, as a condition of their government relief

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,000
funding, to not lay off or furlough any staff, so the marginal staffing cost to operate an

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,040
additional flight is minimal.

120
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,520
Thirdly, with no passengers, airlines have quickly innovated new ways to carry cargo.

121
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,380
Many airlines have loaded their passenger cabins with cargo placed directly on top of

122
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,340
and fastened to seats.

123
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:42,260
This dramatically increases complexity and loading time, but it also dramatically increases

124
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,540
capacity.

125
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:47,520
All of these conditions and circumstances combine to the point that, for this brief

126
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,880
moment in time, economics dictate that an airline can turn a profit flying a passenger

127
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,400
plane without passengers.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,780
Big airlines like American Airlines, Air Canada, Lufthansa, and Air New Zealand began cargo-only

129
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,780
flights, so many, in fact, that united airlines, for example, had up to dozens of passenger-less

130
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,940
passenger planes airborne at the same time all around the world.

131
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,840
This also created flights that have never happened before, like a 16-hour non-stop cargo-only

132
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,940
trip from Sydney to Toronto by Air Canada.

133
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,140
But it wasn't all just big airlines on long flights—smaller airlines, too, got in on

134
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,140
the game.

135
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,720
After Greenland started a link on a tiny propeller Dash 8 to transport coronavirus tests for

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,080
processing in a Danish lab, Titan Airways flew medical supplies to the remote island

137
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:38,940
of St Helena on a passenger A318, and Wizz Air flew their passenger A321s to Shanghai

138
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,480
via Kazakhstan to transport medical supplies to Hungary.

139
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,000
These circumstances have also led to a dramatic reshuffling of rank and order in the aviation

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
world.

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,080
The list of the world's busiest airports, in terms of annual aircraft movements, is

142
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,900
normally headed by Atlanta, followed by Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Beijing, and a number

143
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,020
of other major hub airports.

144
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,560
Normally, you wouldn't expect an airport from America's third least populous state

145
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,520
anywhere on the first pages of that list, however, for a brief moment in April, 2020,

146
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,060
that was the case.

147
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:18,220
Anchorage Airport, in Alaska, became the world's busiest airport thanks to its strategic location.

148
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,840
It has long been a busy cargo airport as it acts as a stopover point for cargo flights

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,580
from Asia to North America.

150
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,580
They stop here because it is more efficient for aircraft, on long-haul flights, to take

151
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,740
less fuel and more cargo and refuel halfway through than fly non-stop to their destination.

152
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:38,860
Also, in some cases, freight is sorted and exchanged between aircraft in Anchorage.

153
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,880
In April, 2020, the US ranked number one in the world for new and total coronavirus cases

154
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,900
so it had a tremendous need for medical supplies which are overwhelmingly produced in Asia

155
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:54,340
so hundreds of cargo aircraft per day passed through Anchorage on their way between Asia

156
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,700
and the US.

157
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,300
So, while every other major airport in the US fell into relative silence, Anchorage was

158
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,340
busier than ever.

159
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,700
There is, however, one final issue that the air cargo world is facing.

160
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,780
Beyond the short-term issue of too much demand, the long-term issue is that this demand will

161
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,900
not last.

162
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,060
Global air cargo demand closely tracks with global economic health.

163
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,660
Every indicator suggests that the economy will not emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic

164
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,780
even close to as strong as when it entered, so there will undoubtedly be some slow months

165
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,860
and years for air cargo.

166
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,140
Once urgent demand for medical supplies eases, and buyers have the time to switch to slower

167
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,740
forms of shipping, the air cargo world will almost certainly follow the fate of its passenger-carrying

168
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,100
colleagues.

169
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,260
On the exact same day as this video goes out, we released a brand new hour-long documentary

170
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:52,740
called The Final Years of Majuro.

171
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,300
It's about the isolated nation of the Marshall Islands and, specifically, what life is like

172
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,320
when you know your nation is coming to an end—when where you live has an expiration

173
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,340
date.

174
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,780
This project is available exclusively on Nebula—the streaming site home to loads of educational

175
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,180
creators' big, ambitious projects.

176
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,260
Now, the best way to get access to Nebula is through CuriosityStream's bundle deal.

178
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,060
get free access to Nebula, but the best deal is absolutely their annual subscription as,

179
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,780
for a limited time, it's available for 40% off meaning both CuriosityStream and Nebula

180
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,020
combined are just $12 a year.

181
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,420
This new documentary was a huge project where we flew a crew to the other side of the world

182
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,940
and worked with a large team for months in post-production, and it was only made possible

183
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,780
thanks to CuriosityStream, Nebula, and your subscriptions to them.
