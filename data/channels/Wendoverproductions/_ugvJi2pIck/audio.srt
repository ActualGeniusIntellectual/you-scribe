00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
articles.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,360
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,500
subjects.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,420
bit more about our amazing world.

9
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,980
With that, let's find this week's article.

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,980
Mhmm.

11
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,980
Mhmm.

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,980
Mhmm.

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,640
U.S. presidents are four times more likely to be left-handed than the general public.

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,800
On average, about 10% of individuals are left-handed, while 46% of American presidents since 1923

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,660
were left-handed.

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,900
Why do we only look at presidents since 1923?

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,420
Well, before recently, left-handedness was treated like a disease.

18
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,820
Believe it or not, the Bible included tons of anti-lefty rhetoric, so parents and teachers

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,620
would often punish kids for using their left hand.

20
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,980
Therefore, most people, including presidents, would often use their right hand to write

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,180
even if they were born a lefty.

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,660
It's entirely possible that many early presidents were left-handed, but it's just not known

23
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,740
since by the time they entered the public eye, they were already using their right hands

24
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,420
for everything.

25
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,580
Herbert Hoover was the first president that we know was left-handed, and since his presidency,

26
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:20,300
Truman, Ford, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Obama have been added to that not-so-exclusive

27
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,840
club.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,820
So what's behind this statistical anomaly?

29
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,840
Well, for one, Americans and other Westerners are more likely to be left-handed than our

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,540
brethren in the eastern hemisphere.

31
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,000
There's a continuing social pressure in many Asian countries to use their right hand

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,900
so many left-handed children are taught to switch.

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,820
There's no longer that pressure in the US, so about 12% of Americans are left-handed.

34
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,100
Men are also slightly more likely to be left-handed, so since approximately 100% of US presidents

35
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,460
have been male, this elevates the chance of a left-handed president by a bit.

36
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,760
But what most contributes to this phenomenon is that presidents are generally considered

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,480
to be smart people.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,140
The average IQ of the general public is about 100 while the average estimated IQ of presidents

39
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,700
is around 130.

40
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,640
It's really hard to determine if left-handedness is linked to increased intelligence, but Mensa

41
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,140
reports that 20% of its members are left-handed.

42
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,260
What is undisputable, however, is that left-handed kids have to learn to adapt to a world made

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,780
for right-handed people.

44
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,240
Scissors, can openers, desks, doors, roads, and even the English writing system were made

45
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,180
for right-handed people.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,980
Michael Peters, a neuropsychologist at the University of Gulf, said that his research

47
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,000
has shown that this necessity for adaptation leads to left-handed individuals being slightly

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,060
more resistant to social pressures and gives them an independent streak.

49
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,340
These are traits that most degree are useful for leaders.

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,620
Chris McManus of University College London wrote in Scientific America that left-handers'

51
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,460
elections are structured differently than right-handers in ways that can allow them

52
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,140
to process language, spatial relations, and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative

53
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,140
ways.

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,100
In the past couple decades, three of the five general elections have been exclusively between

55
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,500
left-handed candidates.

56
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,980
So are the candidates overwhelmingly left-handed in the 2016 election?

57
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Nope.

58
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,820
In fact, no remaining presidential candidate is left-handed.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,220
Is this a sign of what's to come?

60
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,060
Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

61
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,460
