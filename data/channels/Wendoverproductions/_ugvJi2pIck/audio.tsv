0	5800	So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual
5800	6800	articles.
6800	8640	I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.
8640	13360	It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable
13360	14500	subjects.
14500	17900	No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.
17900	21060	For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little
21060	23420	bit more about our amazing world.
23420	25980	With that, let's find this week's article.
25980	26980	Mhmm.
26980	27980	Mhmm.
27980	28980	Mhmm.
28980	33640	U.S. presidents are four times more likely to be left-handed than the general public.
33640	39800	On average, about 10% of individuals are left-handed, while 46% of American presidents since 1923
39800	41660	were left-handed.
41660	43900	Why do we only look at presidents since 1923?
43900	48420	Well, before recently, left-handedness was treated like a disease.
48420	52820	Believe it or not, the Bible included tons of anti-lefty rhetoric, so parents and teachers
52820	55620	would often punish kids for using their left hand.
55660	59980	Therefore, most people, including presidents, would often use their right hand to write
59980	62180	even if they were born a lefty.
62180	66660	It's entirely possible that many early presidents were left-handed, but it's just not known
66660	69740	since by the time they entered the public eye, they were already using their right hands
69740	71420	for everything.
71420	75580	Herbert Hoover was the first president that we know was left-handed, and since his presidency,
75580	80300	Truman, Ford, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Obama have been added to that not-so-exclusive
80300	81840	club.
81840	83820	So what's behind this statistical anomaly?
83820	87840	Well, for one, Americans and other Westerners are more likely to be left-handed than our
87840	89540	brethren in the eastern hemisphere.
89540	94000	There's a continuing social pressure in many Asian countries to use their right hand
94000	96900	so many left-handed children are taught to switch.
96900	102820	There's no longer that pressure in the US, so about 12% of Americans are left-handed.
102820	107100	Men are also slightly more likely to be left-handed, so since approximately 100% of US presidents
107100	111460	have been male, this elevates the chance of a left-handed president by a bit.
111460	114760	But what most contributes to this phenomenon is that presidents are generally considered
114760	116480	to be smart people.
116480	121140	The average IQ of the general public is about 100 while the average estimated IQ of presidents
121140	122700	is around 130.
122700	127640	It's really hard to determine if left-handedness is linked to increased intelligence, but Mensa
127640	131140	reports that 20% of its members are left-handed.
131140	135260	What is undisputable, however, is that left-handed kids have to learn to adapt to a world made
135260	136780	for right-handed people.
137100	142240	Scissors, can openers, desks, doors, roads, and even the English writing system were made
142240	144180	for right-handed people.
144180	147980	Michael Peters, a neuropsychologist at the University of Gulf, said that his research
147980	152000	has shown that this necessity for adaptation leads to left-handed individuals being slightly
152000	157060	more resistant to social pressures and gives them an independent streak.
157060	160340	These are traits that most degree are useful for leaders.
160340	164620	Chris McManus of University College London wrote in Scientific America that left-handers'
164620	167460	elections are structured differently than right-handers in ways that can allow them
167460	172140	to process language, spatial relations, and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative
172140	174140	ways.
174140	178100	In the past couple decades, three of the five general elections have been exclusively between
178100	180500	left-handed candidates.
180500	183980	So are the candidates overwhelmingly left-handed in the 2016 election?
183980	184980	Nope.
184980	188820	In fact, no remaining presidential candidate is left-handed.
188820	190220	Is this a sign of what's to come?
190220	192060	Well, we'll just have to wait and see.
