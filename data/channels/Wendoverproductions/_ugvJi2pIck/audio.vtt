00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
So, there's this fantastic Wikipedia list descriptively titled Wikipedia colon unusual

00:05.800 --> 00:06.800
articles.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.640
I just remember it as that Wikipedia list.

00:08.640 --> 00:13.360
It's a collection of hundreds of articles about unusual, unexpected, and unbelievable

00:13.360 --> 00:14.500
subjects.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.900
No matter what link you click, it's bound to be interesting.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.060
For that reason, every week I'm going to click on a new link and teach you a little

00:21.060 --> 00:23.420
bit more about our amazing world.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.980
With that, let's find this week's article.

00:25.980 --> 00:26.980
Mhmm.

00:26.980 --> 00:27.980
Mhmm.

00:27.980 --> 00:28.980
Mhmm.

00:28.980 --> 00:33.640
U.S. presidents are four times more likely to be left-handed than the general public.

00:33.640 --> 00:39.800
On average, about 10% of individuals are left-handed, while 46% of American presidents since 1923

00:39.800 --> 00:41.660
were left-handed.

00:41.660 --> 00:43.900
Why do we only look at presidents since 1923?

00:43.900 --> 00:48.420
Well, before recently, left-handedness was treated like a disease.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.820
Believe it or not, the Bible included tons of anti-lefty rhetoric, so parents and teachers

00:52.820 --> 00:55.620
would often punish kids for using their left hand.

00:55.660 --> 00:59.980
Therefore, most people, including presidents, would often use their right hand to write

00:59.980 --> 01:02.180
even if they were born a lefty.

01:02.180 --> 01:06.660
It's entirely possible that many early presidents were left-handed, but it's just not known

01:06.660 --> 01:09.740
since by the time they entered the public eye, they were already using their right hands

01:09.740 --> 01:11.420
for everything.

01:11.420 --> 01:15.580
Herbert Hoover was the first president that we know was left-handed, and since his presidency,

01:15.580 --> 01:20.300
Truman, Ford, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton, and Obama have been added to that not-so-exclusive

01:20.300 --> 01:21.840
club.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.820
So what's behind this statistical anomaly?

01:23.820 --> 01:27.840
Well, for one, Americans and other Westerners are more likely to be left-handed than our

01:27.840 --> 01:29.540
brethren in the eastern hemisphere.

01:29.540 --> 01:34.000
There's a continuing social pressure in many Asian countries to use their right hand

01:34.000 --> 01:36.900
so many left-handed children are taught to switch.

01:36.900 --> 01:42.820
There's no longer that pressure in the US, so about 12% of Americans are left-handed.

01:42.820 --> 01:47.100
Men are also slightly more likely to be left-handed, so since approximately 100% of US presidents

01:47.100 --> 01:51.460
have been male, this elevates the chance of a left-handed president by a bit.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.760
But what most contributes to this phenomenon is that presidents are generally considered

01:54.760 --> 01:56.480
to be smart people.

01:56.480 --> 02:01.140
The average IQ of the general public is about 100 while the average estimated IQ of presidents

02:01.140 --> 02:02.700
is around 130.

02:02.700 --> 02:07.640
It's really hard to determine if left-handedness is linked to increased intelligence, but Mensa

02:07.640 --> 02:11.140
reports that 20% of its members are left-handed.

02:11.140 --> 02:15.260
What is undisputable, however, is that left-handed kids have to learn to adapt to a world made

02:15.260 --> 02:16.780
for right-handed people.

02:17.100 --> 02:22.240
Scissors, can openers, desks, doors, roads, and even the English writing system were made

02:22.240 --> 02:24.180
for right-handed people.

02:24.180 --> 02:27.980
Michael Peters, a neuropsychologist at the University of Gulf, said that his research

02:27.980 --> 02:32.000
has shown that this necessity for adaptation leads to left-handed individuals being slightly

02:32.000 --> 02:37.060
more resistant to social pressures and gives them an independent streak.

02:37.060 --> 02:40.340
These are traits that most degree are useful for leaders.

02:40.340 --> 02:44.620
Chris McManus of University College London wrote in Scientific America that left-handers'

02:44.620 --> 02:47.460
elections are structured differently than right-handers in ways that can allow them

02:47.460 --> 02:52.140
to process language, spatial relations, and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative

02:52.140 --> 02:54.140
ways.

02:54.140 --> 02:58.100
In the past couple decades, three of the five general elections have been exclusively between

02:58.100 --> 03:00.500
left-handed candidates.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.980
So are the candidates overwhelmingly left-handed in the 2016 election?

03:03.980 --> 03:04.980
Nope.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.820
In fact, no remaining presidential candidate is left-handed.

03:08.820 --> 03:10.220
Is this a sign of what's to come?

03:10.220 --> 03:12.060
Well, we'll just have to wait and see.

03:15.260 --> 03:18.460
