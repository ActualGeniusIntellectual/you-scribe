0	5060	New Guinea, this massive island, is split vertically in two by the border between Papua
5060	11060	New Guinea and Indonesia, then split horizontally by the towering Central Cordillera Range.
11060	15300	These peaks stretch so high as to produce snow, improbably just a few hundred miles
15300	18980	from the equator, then the snow melts off.
18980	23860	It funnels down into valleys, filling rivers, fueling agriculture, then finally depositing
23860	28400	its nutrient-rich flow into the island's coastal, mangrove forests.
28400	33580	The vitality of these forests translates into their vitality as fish spawning ground.
33580	38540	Marine life—lots of marine life—starts its life here, then swims out and matures
38540	40780	in the Ara Fora Sea.
40780	45460	This sea, nestled between Indonesia and Australia, is one of the most productive fisheries in
45460	49140	the world—or at least, it used to be.
49140	52540	Legally, territorially, it's split in two.
52540	57540	Australia has the southern half, Indonesia has the northern half, but Indonesia, historically,
57560	61800	did little to restrict and enforce restrictions on fishing these waters.
61800	67720	A 2001 survey found that 85% of vessels over 50 gross tons were operating without a license,
67720	70880	and a mere 30% of catch was being properly reported.
70880	74920	But the story's rather different on the other side of the sea.
74920	78040	Australia's north is extremely sparsely populated.
78040	82020	Save for the city of Darwin, the coast is just dotted with extremely small towns every
82020	83720	couple hundred miles.
83720	88440	Respondingly, the region has never had a massive fishing industry, despite its location
88440	90100	on the Ara Fora Sea.
90100	95260	The Northern Territory, with the most Ara Fora coastline, has a mere 147 registered
95260	98040	fishing vessels, and this seems to make sense.
98040	101300	Cost of living is far higher in Australia than Indonesia.
101300	106560	GDP per capita is 14 times higher on the southern side of the sea, yet the distance from either
106560	110500	side to Australia's populated southeast is roughly equivalent.
110500	114660	Therefore, Indonesia's fishing industry is likely able to outcompete on cost in the
114660	119620	Australian market and beyond, and so the vast majority of the Ara Fora Sea fishing has occurred
119620	122880	in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.
122880	127040	While very difficult to definitively prove, there is a corresponding belief among Indonesian
127040	131920	fishers that the Australian side is more plentiful in fish, and they're likely right—they're
131920	137440	especially right when it comes to one specific, highly valuable fish—the shark.
137440	142020	Shark fishing is rare in Australia, and shark finning is entirely illegal.
142020	146080	That's the practice of catching a shark, cutting off its fins, and throwing the rest
146080	148660	of the animal back into the ocean to die.
148660	153260	This is done because shark fins are extremely valuable in Asian markets especially, often
153260	157900	selling for over $500 per pound or $225 per kilogram.
157900	161940	The rest of the body is less valuable, so to save space on their small boats and more
161940	166460	easily get their illicit product to market, poachers will often only keep the fins.
166460	171260	This means a single poacher could kill dozens, even hundreds of sharks in one journey.
171260	175520	But considering finning is illegal and well-enforced in Australia, and considering shark hunting
175520	181560	writ large is so rare and well-enforced, Australia's coastal shark populations are doing well,
181560	184800	at least compared to those on the north side of the sea.
184800	187380	But poachers know this, and so here's what happens.
187380	191620	A small wooden boat leaves from the small island city of Dobo.
191620	196060	It tracks south, and continues tracking south, outside of Indonesia's exclusive economic
196060	201140	zone, where it has rights to fish, and into Australia's, where it does not.
201140	204820	Thanks to the sea's shallow depths and ultimately mellow conditions, it's able to make it
204820	208780	all the way to this collection of islands on Australia's northern coast.
208780	212800	The islands are unpopulated, and far from anywhere that is, so they're able to set
212800	217660	up camp on Australian soil, spending their days searching through the surrounding bays,
217660	220200	finding and finning shark as they go.
220200	224320	This is entirely illegal—they don't have the right to fish, they don't have the right
224320	228040	to fish in this manner, and they don't have the right to step on Australian soil, but
228040	231040	there's little chance they'll face consequences.
231040	235600	The Australian navy does patrol the coast, but it's just so vast and desolate that
235600	238820	the odds are in the Indonesian fisher's favour.
238820	242800	Even if they do get caught, punishment can only happen if the navy can successfully get
242800	245280	personnel on the Indonesian boat.
245280	250020	The boat might stop, but they regularly don't—they put spikes or spears on the sides of their
250020	254020	hulls to make boarding riskier, then head full speed north, towards the border between
254020	256340	Australian and Indonesian waters.
256340	261340	It might take hours, it might take days, but once they cross that line, there's nothing
261340	263500	the Australians can do.
263500	267460	And knowing the risks of attempting to board a small boat with sharp obstacles at high
267460	271900	speed, the navy might decide to abandon the chase long before that line.
271900	276020	While arrests do happen, and are happening in record numbers, it's understood that
276020	280900	these only represent a small fraction of the incursions into Australian waters.
280900	284100	So Australia's well-protected fish stocks are being plundered.
284100	288540	Ultimately, though, they're being plundered by the plundered.
288540	292900	Indonesian fishers are not truly responsible for the downfall of their fishery—rather,
292900	297340	it was foreign vessels that trawled their ocean treasures.
297340	298780	Consider the country's neighbours.
298780	302820	According to the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Index, which scores countries
302820	307460	and regions on their vulnerability to illegal practices, Indonesia itself ranks 20th in
307460	311060	the world, while its neighbors in the Pacific rank even worse.
311060	316680	Japan is 12th, South Korea is third, Russia is second, and then there's China.
316680	323040	Not only is China number one in the IUU fishing index, it reels in by far the most fish tonnage
323040	329100	year in, year out, and is home to by far the biggest fishing fleet in the world—effectively,
329100	332980	providing a recipe for overfishing at a global scale, on its own.
332980	337820	China's appetite for the ocean was born in the 1980s as personal income began an ascent
337820	339940	that is yet to meaningfully slow.
339940	344540	By 2000, after catch tonnage in China's EEZ had quadrupled, the nation's fisheries
344540	349220	were on the verge of collapse so state planners and struggling boat captains alike turned
349220	354540	their attention to foreign and contested waters—sometimes legally, other times not.
354540	358300	With their own fisheries in trouble, Indonesia tried to halt foreign fleets from entering
358300	360340	its waters in 2014.
360340	364660	The poaching vessels it caught, once processed, were publicly blown up or burned down at sea
364660	366460	as a show of force.
366460	370660	Yet, even in the face of potentially losing their vessels for good, Chinese boats were
370660	375020	identified in the hundreds across Indonesian waters in the wake of the policy—there were
375020	379700	simply too many for the cash-strapped country to possibly catch.
379700	384340	Their seas now plundered, Indonesian fishers turned their attention then towards Australia.
384900	390180	But the influence of China's massive, unwieldy, unregulated fishing force is felt far beyond
390180	391380	the Western Pacific.
391380	396460	China's also home to the world's largest distant water fleet—boats big enough and
396460	400380	capable enough to cross oceans, not just stick to coasts.
400380	404180	Exactly how big this fleet is, no one's quite sure, as some reports have estimated
404180	409500	the number in the 3000s, while more recent estimates have put it at 17,000.
409500	416220	Either way, it is massive, as the US distant water fleet, for comparison, is only 300 boats.
416220	422380	This Chinese armada has taken Asian-Pacific problems and exported them around the globe.
422380	424260	Take West Africa, for example.
424260	428940	Here, off the rich coast of Mauritania, south to Sierra Leone, Chinese companies have been
428940	431860	buying fishing licenses and fishing since the mid-1980s.
431860	437620	In the past decade, though, these parties—African governments and Chinese fishing companies—have
437620	439100	reached a reckoning point.
439100	442860	While the countries have offered specific catch quotas to fishing companies to protect
442860	447740	the nation's stock, local fishing communities have noticed an alarming lack of fish.
447740	452700	In Senegal, where a fifth of all people work in fishing, and some 85% of protein intake
452700	457140	is fish, this has destroyed jobs and created real food scarcity.
457140	461700	And it isn't due to over-allocating fishing licenses, but because Chinese ships report
461700	467060	only a paltry 8% of their actual catch along the African coasts.
467060	472620	For their part, Senegal has, at points, discontinued offering fishing licenses to foreign boats.
472620	476980	But this only does so much, as Senegal, nor developing countries like it, have the navy
476980	480820	or satellite tracking capabilities to enforce moratoriums.
480820	485660	And even when boats respect such fishing freezes, they still can simply move operations to the
485660	490580	edge of Senegal's exclusive economic zone, to international waters, continuing to fish
490580	492800	around the clock.
492800	497000	No matter where you look, these distant water fleets are crushing fisheries with little
497000	500440	regard for national or international rules.
500440	504840	Back in the Pacific, tracking services have followed Chinese fleets into North Korean
504840	505840	waters.
505840	509260	This likely explains why fragments of Korean ships have been mysteriously washing up on
509260	510920	Japanese beaches.
510920	515160	Local fishers can't compete in their own waters now dominated by Chinese ships so they've
515160	520200	gone farther out to sea where their small boats are battered and crews are sent overboard.
520200	524860	But beyond bullying local fishers, moving into this EEZ is another blatant disregard
524860	529120	for the rules, as they're ignoring UN sanctions that forbid fishing in North Korean waters
529120	532760	while simultaneously wiping out North Korea's fish population.
532760	536840	The pattern repeats on the high seas too, where international laws are looser to begin
536840	537840	with.
537840	542240	In recent years, Chinese fishing armadas have earned the ominous moniker of dark fleets
542240	547640	as they've suspiciously disabled their AIS tracking systems for days and weeks at a time.
547640	553160	This allows fishing vessels to sneak into EEZs, fish, then quietly slide back into international
553160	555920	waters where they turn their transponders back on.
555920	559560	It also allows fishing companies to launder their catch, as a fishing ship will go dark
559560	563800	and unload their catch onto larger transport ships, which muddies the water on where exactly
563800	568560	the catch originated, and allows the boat to illegally dump low-grade fish or move illegal
568560	569740	catches.
569740	574040	This is called transshipment, which, while legal when authorized by regional authorities,
574040	576920	is often done with transponders turned off.
576920	582520	But, while both sneaking into EEZs and unauthorized transshipments are illegal, both require evidence
582520	583960	to prove the fleets guilty.
583960	587680	While it's obvious that's what they're probably doing, someone needs to catch the
587680	592360	companies in the act, then catch the boats themselves—two tasks that are both extremely
592360	597040	expensive and extremely difficult in the endless expanse of the ocean.
597040	599040	So, it continues.
599040	602320	Small operators catch the fish they're not supposed to in places they're not supposed
602320	603320	to.
603320	606920	Small operators catch fish in too high a number or fish they aren't supposed to catch at
606920	609440	all, then launder their catch via shipping boats.
609440	614160	For all these reasons, one out of every five fish that ends up on a plate was illegally
614160	615160	caught.
615160	619060	But more importantly, it's why what's always been seen as an inexhaustible resource
619060	624240	is being increasingly pushed to the brink by a devastatingly, ruthlessly efficient machine.
624240	628680	And the existential threats posed to our oceans aren't just confined to fish populations
628680	630220	either.
630220	635300	The ocean's potential most valuable treasures may, in fact, serve not to nourish, but to
635300	636700	heal.
636700	640220	Traditional medicine has relied on plants and animals from the ocean for millennia,
640220	644920	but despite long-held diversion, modern medicine is now increasingly recognizing the value
644920	646580	of some of these treatments.
646580	651380	There's the drug called halivan, over $300 million in sales per year, that extends the
651380	655920	life of late-stage breast cancer patients by five or six months, and it's derived
655920	657460	from a Japanese sea sponge.
657460	661820	There's the drug called prialt, which is remarkably effective at treating severe chronic
661820	667540	pain, evades the downsides of opioids, and is based on the venom of sea-based cone snails.
667540	671660	And beyond these and more already in use, there are a dozen or so more marine-based
671660	674700	drugs currently making their way through clinical testing.
674700	679260	This makes sense—after all, there are countless drugs that leverage the compounds found in
679260	683960	land-based plants and animals for their healing properties, but the ocean is a far more biodiverse
683960	688640	place than land—a majority of Earth's biodiversity is in the ocean.
688640	692680	There are more distinct plants or animals that could be used for drugs, they just need
692680	693720	to be found.
693720	698880	The ocean is woefully underexplored—in fact, only about 10% of marine species are thought
698880	704040	to have even been discovered—but the difficulty of marine exploration and sampling is lowering
704040	709020	as more and more submersibles are being developed, and even more so as the costs of testing and
709020	711280	studying samples has cratered.
711280	716180	DNA sequencing, for example, is an important part of this, and whereas in 2001 it cost
716180	722480	over $5,000 to sequence a million bases, today that cost is down to almost half a cent.
722480	726800	Therefore, whereas today the use of these marine genetic resources is largely confined
726800	732880	to useful yet niche drugs, there is an expectation that due to increased exploration and research,
732880	738000	someday soon someone might identify a groundbreaking compound to treat a common illness and set
738000	741600	off a pharmaceutical gold rush in the world's oceans.
741600	745920	But a far more literal gold rush also sits on the ocean's horizon.
745920	752120	That's because down below, on its floor, are these—polymetallic nodules.
752120	754680	These are potato-sized clumps of metals.
754680	759760	It varies, but notably they include some valuable ones like manganese, zinc, cobalt, copper,
759760	761960	and nickel, and they're really just sitting there.
761960	764640	This is rather tantalizing, especially these days.
764640	768560	As the world looks to build more wind turbines, electric car batteries, and other bastions
768560	772320	of a decarbonized grid, these metals are in greater and greater demand.
772320	776680	There's going to have to be more production somewhere, and some argue that deep-sea mining
776680	782720	has the potential to develop into a low-cost, low-impact source compared to land-based mining.
782720	785120	Naturally, others disagree.
785120	789040	Collecting these nodules at scale, at least with current technology, requires significant
789040	793720	disturbance to the seafloor, which would inevitably destroy marine habitats and kick up huge plumes
793760	796440	of sediment that would impact surrounding sea life.
796440	800120	The ocean floor also stores large amounts of carbon, and so there's also a concern
800120	804380	that the disturbance could release the carbon up into the atmosphere, thereby further negating
804380	806720	any environmental benefit.
806720	810620	Right now, nobody's mining the ocean floor at commercial scale.
810620	815120	The International Seabed Authority, the UN body responsible for regulating such activity,
815120	820120	has only granted 31 exploratory licenses for small-scale tests.
820120	825440	But this could change very, very soon, thanks to the second section of the 15th paragraph
825440	831000	of the first annex of the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of Part 11 of the United
831000	833400	Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea.
833400	838280	What this essentially states is that, if an ISA member nation wants to start deep-sea
838280	843940	mining operations, the Authority has two years to set rules on how that can take place.
843940	849680	On July 9th, 2021, the nation of Nauru triggered that two-year countdown.
849680	855080	July 9th, 2023 has now come and gone, and the International Seabed Authority has failed
855080	860720	to set rules on deep-sea mining, meaning Nauru and all nations are now theoretically allowed
860720	865800	to start any sort of operations with absolutely zero environmental restrictions.
865800	870760	Now, given that the International Seabed Authority regulates international waters—the high
870760	875400	seas—Nauru would simply be the facilitator in a theoretical deep-sea mining operation—it
875400	877620	wouldn't happen in their waters.
877620	881940	As an ISA member nation, they're partnered with Canada-based The Metals Company, essentially
881940	886060	serving as a friendly government willing to submit a license application to the International
886060	890940	Seabed Authority on the company's behalf—presumably because larger governments, like Canada's,
890940	894900	are unwilling to be seen as the first to open the door to an environmentally destructive
894900	896020	process.
896020	900180	Once a license application is submitted by Nauru, it would then be reviewed by the ISA's
900180	903540	legal and technical commission on whether it meets the body's regulations—which
903540	907480	don't currently exist—which would issue a recommendation to the organization's thirty-six
907480	909000	member voting council.
909000	910440	But this is where things get tricky.
910440	914600	The council has told the legal and technical commission not to issue recommendations until
914600	918920	regulations are set to avoid having to vote on one, but a subset of members are arguing
918920	921600	that this is a violation of the law of the sea.
921600	925460	They say that the legal and technical commission's role is to examine compliance with whatever
925460	930440	the regulations are, and since there are no regulations, any application must be recommended
930440	931520	for approval.
931520	935420	No application has yet been submitted, but essentially, the authority is setting itself
935420	937440	up for a legal showdown.
937440	941720	There is no consensus on how their system is supposed to work, and therefore it's
941720	944000	at risk of breaking down.
944000	948300	Meanwhile, the body also seems deadlocked on the overall issue.
948300	952840	Some members, like Nauru and China, are fully in support of regulated but abundant deep-sea
952840	957220	mining, others, like Switzerland and Germany, are in support of a moratorium until further
957220	961720	study can be done on the practices' effects, while others still, like France, are already
961720	966200	in support of an outright ban on deep-sea mining, convinced that the gain is not worth
966200	967200	the cost.
967200	971160	But at the end of the day, it's tough to understand whether this matters at all because
971160	975680	some 30 or so nations are not even members of the ISA, and therefore aren't subject
975680	976960	to its rules.
976960	980080	This includes, most notably, the United States.
980080	983920	Its Senate voted not to ratify the treaty that would have led to ISA membership, with
983920	988000	many of those dissenting specifically citing the potential that the body would restrict
988000	991400	deep-sea mining operations that the country might want to permit.
991400	996300	Therefore, the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already granted
996300	1000380	exploratory licenses to American companies, and while these aren't recognized by the
1000380	1005540	ISA, companies might use them as the authority on which to begin their operations in international
1005540	1006540	waters.
1006540	1011020	If the US decides to allow full-scale commercial operations, while the ISA does not, this could
1011020	1016140	kick off a showdown between the UN and US, as companies use American backing as the legal
1016140	1020260	authority on which to base their international operations.
1020260	1024980	At this point, what happens with deep-sea mining is still very much up in the air.
1024980	1028660	As for the management of the rest of the treasures abound in international waters,
1028660	1033660	though, some sort of systematic management might start with this—the Biodiversity Beyond
1033660	1038420	National Jurisdiction Treaty, or the Treaty of the High Seas, as it's become known.
1038420	1042680	While these 54 pages of term definitions, provisions, articles, and objectives didn't
1042680	1046900	make a major news splash, the agreement to the final draft at UN headquarters on March
1046900	1049300	4th, 2023 was a big deal.
1049300	1052980	Nearly 20 years in the making, the Treaty of the High Seas addresses something that
1052980	1057500	had slipped through the cracks in previous agreements involving international waters—nature
1057500	1058500	and natural resources.
1058500	1063040	This treaty sets a framework for sharing access to marine genetic resources between countries
1063040	1067520	in the form of samples, data, and sequencing—a framework for requiring environmental impact
1067520	1071700	assessment should one party consider another's activity potentially environmentally harmful,
1071700	1076220	and a groundwork to begin management of marine protected areas where all harvesting of resources
1076220	1077660	is strictly prohibited.
1077660	1081580	In other words, should something be harvested on the high seas for scientific purposes,
1081580	1085140	the findings will need to be shared, should a country launch a project on the high seas,
1085140	1088780	then others will have the right to first require an impact assessment, and should the UN reach
1088780	1093420	its goal for protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030, it will use the tools provided in the
1093420	1096060	document to make decisions on protected areas.
1096060	1099920	But for those concerned with the prospect of deep sea mining, the treaty has been seen
1099920	1103980	as a bit of a letdown, as it doesn't encompass high seas activities that already have their
1103980	1108080	own regulatory bodies like the ISA—a point that China has been unwilling to move off
1108080	1109960	of throughout negotiations.
1109960	1113820	But for the bigger picture, those concerned with the immediate future of ocean environments
1113820	1118080	in the face of major threats, this has been viewed as an unprecedented win, something
1118080	1122440	that hasn't been done before, and something that has the potential to fundamentally alter
1122440	1123440	the ocean's future.
1123440	1126360	But the treaty still has a long way to go.
1126360	1130200	With the draft agreed to in March, the agreement wasn't actually adopted until as recently
1130200	1135660	as June 20th, 2023 at the UN Intergovernmental Conference, and isn't expected to open for
1135660	1139840	nation signatures until September, at which point it will become law two months after
1139840	1142120	the 60th country has ratified it.
1142120	1146440	With the EU, US, and China all playing roles in negotiating the treaty, it's expected
1146440	1150940	that all the major players in international waters will ratify sooner or later.
1150940	1156980	But even then, once ratified, should nothing go wrong, it's still an international treaty—a
1156980	1161180	style of agreement that's hardly proved the end-all be-all in regards to environmental
1161180	1162180	efforts.
1162180	1166260	With sovereign states looking out for their own interests first and foremost, these agreements
1166260	1169100	are usually backed as long as they're convenient.
1169100	1172840	Look no further than the Paris Agreement being hamstrung by countries choosing their own
1172840	1177120	emissions cuts, and scaling back their own commitments after signing.
1177120	1181360	And also look no further than the Paris Agreement as an example of a treaty becoming so overly
1181360	1186220	politicized that the US withdrew from it entirely at one point.
1186220	1188880	International treaties work when they don't get in the way of state interest, but they
1188880	1193440	become much harder to uphold once it conflicts with the immediate interests of a nation,
1193440	1197920	or worse still, happens to benefit one over the other.
1197920	1201580	Perhaps the most potentially damning, though, is the issue of enforcement.
1201580	1206880	In the most simple terms, the UN doesn't have a navy, the oceans are impossibly vast,
1206880	1210980	and nations have struggled to protect their own exclusive economic zones from poaching
1210980	1214500	the world over, let alone the open seas.
1214500	1219240	There may be buy-in now, but enforcing compliance and regulating the high seas will ultimately
1219240	1222320	inform the success and impact of the treaty.
1222320	1227460	The prospect of unregulated deep-sea mining feels existential—it feels like something
1227460	1232180	that could permanently alter perhaps the most pristine areas on the planet, the final
1232180	1234940	corners untouched by human hands.
1234940	1238980	But this existential threat has already been realized.
1238980	1244620	The transition from small-scale to industrial fishing has wreaked havoc on the oceans.
1244620	1249420	A third of global fish stocks are being overfished, meaning fish are being removed faster than
1249420	1250880	they reproduce.
1250880	1254640	Another 60% is being fished at the reproduction rate.
1254640	1260280	Only no fish stocks are growing globally, and all of these statistics are trending further
1260280	1262860	and further towards oblivion.
1262860	1267680	There is enormous economic incentive for individual actors to continue to fish as much as they
1267680	1268680	can.
1268680	1272840	This is the tragedy of the commons, and while this problem can be solved on a national level,
1272840	1277680	the world has yet to find a true, long-term solution to solving this internationally.
1277680	1283660	When each nation has to opt into regulating itself, the tragedy of the commons stays alive.
1283660	1288500	Individual actors will choose to follow the economic incentives and opt themselves out.
1288500	1292520	To date, fishing is perhaps the most tangible manifestation of this problem.
1292520	1296220	In modern times, there aren't many other resources that can be pulled from an environment
1296220	1299820	so devoid of rules, regulations, or repercussions.
1299820	1304320	But technological development threatens to open up new categories with the same problems,
1304320	1309940	and not only in the oceans—there's also the entire rest of the universe.
1309940	1314720	outer space operates under the same system—its laws are based on maritime law, and therefore
1314720	1317420	face the same shortcomings.
1317420	1321680	Asteroid mining is a near-direct analogy of deep-sea mining in terms of the legal and
1321680	1324020	environmental conundrums it cracks open.
1324020	1328140	There's little understanding of how the world will effectively regulate such a practice,
1328140	1333100	and like with deep-sea mining, marine pharmacology, and more, there's reason to be pessimistic
1333100	1335940	when looking at fishing as precedent.
1335940	1340900	As the world globalizes and technology advances, problems and potential are growing increasingly
1340900	1345740	beyond national scale, so one must find ways to use the age-old practice of diplomacy to
1345740	1349660	build cooperation and consensus for the good of all, over the good of one.
1349660	1354180	And perhaps the best problem to solve first is not the hypothetical, but the one that
1354180	1358180	exists now—right in front of us.
1358180	1363180	Solve the fish, and then maybe we can solve the future.
1363180	1367420	You might be surprised to hear just how much more of a problem this ship is than this one—I
1367420	1371380	certainly was when researching this topic—but big industrial ships like this have become
1371380	1373460	just ruthlessly efficient.
1373460	1378820	In fact, this one ship once hauled in almost a quarter of the UK's entire annual fishing
1378820	1379820	quota.
1379820	1384100	It is just amazing how much this process has been optimized, and while there wasn't time
1384100	1387880	to get much into how industrial fishing works in this video, I still wanted to learn more
1387880	1392120	about it, so we made an entire episode of our Nebula-exclusive series, The Logistics
1392120	1394360	of X, on fishing.
1394360	1397800	Every few Wendover videos, we make one of these diving deeper into the logistics of
1397800	1401700	the video's topic—we've done one on ski resorts, search and rescue, and we already
1401700	1405440	have more in production—and the fishing episode is perhaps the most fascinating one
1405440	1410280	yet—I just never knew how much complexity there was behind the fish that we all ultimately
1410280	1415840	eat, and of course this is just one small part of the huge catalogue of Nebula originals.
1415840	1420580	All sorts of creators, like us, Real Engineering, Polymatter, Neo, Mustard, Real Life Lore,
1420580	1425340	and so many more have made shows, documentaries, films, plays, and more with the bigger budgets
1425340	1427040	Nebula is able to offer.
1427040	1430780	This is thanks to the funding that comes in through Nebula subscribers who, in addition
1430780	1434860	to getting access to these, also get to watch all their creators' regular videos early
1434860	1436400	and ad-free.
1436400	1440100	Subscribing to Nebula is a great way of supporting independent creators and helps to build this
1440100	1443860	new revenue source for them through producing higher-budget content while also giving them
1443860	1447540	the financial stability that allows for scaling up production for YouTube.
1447540	1452140	This is especially true since when you sign up at our link, Nebula.tv-slash-Wendover will
1452140	1456260	get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, and you'll
1456260	1461620	get 40% off an annual subscription, which brings the cost down to just $2.50 a month.
1461620	1465860	Basically, it's a great deal for both of us, so if you want to watch the logistics
1465860	1471020	of X and help support the channel, once again, head to Nebula.tv-slash-Wendover, and thanks,
1471020	1472540	in advance, for your support.
