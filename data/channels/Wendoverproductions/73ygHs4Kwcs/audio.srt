1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
New Guinea, this massive island, is split vertically in two by the border between Papua

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,060
New Guinea and Indonesia, then split horizontally by the towering Central Cordillera Range.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,300
These peaks stretch so high as to produce snow, improbably just a few hundred miles

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,980
from the equator, then the snow melts off.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,860
It funnels down into valleys, filling rivers, fueling agriculture, then finally depositing

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,400
its nutrient-rich flow into the island's coastal, mangrove forests.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,580
The vitality of these forests translates into their vitality as fish spawning ground.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,540
Marine life—lots of marine life—starts its life here, then swims out and matures

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,780
in the Ara Fora Sea.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,460
This sea, nestled between Indonesia and Australia, is one of the most productive fisheries in

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,140
the world—or at least, it used to be.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,540
Legally, territorially, it's split in two.

13
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,540
Australia has the southern half, Indonesia has the northern half, but Indonesia, historically,

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,800
did little to restrict and enforce restrictions on fishing these waters.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,720
A 2001 survey found that 85% of vessels over 50 gross tons were operating without a license,

16
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,880
and a mere 30% of catch was being properly reported.

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,920
But the story's rather different on the other side of the sea.

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,040
Australia's north is extremely sparsely populated.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,020
Save for the city of Darwin, the coast is just dotted with extremely small towns every

20
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,720
couple hundred miles.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,440
Respondingly, the region has never had a massive fishing industry, despite its location

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,100
on the Ara Fora Sea.

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,260
The Northern Territory, with the most Ara Fora coastline, has a mere 147 registered

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,040
fishing vessels, and this seems to make sense.

25
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,300
Cost of living is far higher in Australia than Indonesia.

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,560
GDP per capita is 14 times higher on the southern side of the sea, yet the distance from either

27
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,500
side to Australia's populated southeast is roughly equivalent.

28
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,660
Therefore, Indonesia's fishing industry is likely able to outcompete on cost in the

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:59,620
Australian market and beyond, and so the vast majority of the Ara Fora Sea fishing has occurred

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,880
in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,040
While very difficult to definitively prove, there is a corresponding belief among Indonesian

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
fishers that the Australian side is more plentiful in fish, and they're likely right—they're

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,440
especially right when it comes to one specific, highly valuable fish—the shark.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,020
Shark fishing is rare in Australia, and shark finning is entirely illegal.

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,080
That's the practice of catching a shark, cutting off its fins, and throwing the rest

36
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,660
of the animal back into the ocean to die.

37
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,260
This is done because shark fins are extremely valuable in Asian markets especially, often

38
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,900
selling for over $500 per pound or $225 per kilogram.

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,940
The rest of the body is less valuable, so to save space on their small boats and more

40
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,460
easily get their illicit product to market, poachers will often only keep the fins.

41
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,260
This means a single poacher could kill dozens, even hundreds of sharks in one journey.

42
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,520
But considering finning is illegal and well-enforced in Australia, and considering shark hunting

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:01,560
writ large is so rare and well-enforced, Australia's coastal shark populations are doing well,

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,800
at least compared to those on the north side of the sea.

45
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,380
But poachers know this, and so here's what happens.

46
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,620
A small wooden boat leaves from the small island city of Dobo.

47
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,060
It tracks south, and continues tracking south, outside of Indonesia's exclusive economic

48
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,140
zone, where it has rights to fish, and into Australia's, where it does not.

49
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,820
Thanks to the sea's shallow depths and ultimately mellow conditions, it's able to make it

50
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,780
all the way to this collection of islands on Australia's northern coast.

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,800
The islands are unpopulated, and far from anywhere that is, so they're able to set

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,660
up camp on Australian soil, spending their days searching through the surrounding bays,

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,200
finding and finning shark as they go.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,320
This is entirely illegal—they don't have the right to fish, they don't have the right

55
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,040
to fish in this manner, and they don't have the right to step on Australian soil, but

56
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,040
there's little chance they'll face consequences.

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,600
The Australian navy does patrol the coast, but it's just so vast and desolate that

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,820
the odds are in the Indonesian fisher's favour.

59
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,800
Even if they do get caught, punishment can only happen if the navy can successfully get

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,280
personnel on the Indonesian boat.

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,020
The boat might stop, but they regularly don't—they put spikes or spears on the sides of their

62
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,020
hulls to make boarding riskier, then head full speed north, towards the border between

63
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,340
Australian and Indonesian waters.

64
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,340
It might take hours, it might take days, but once they cross that line, there's nothing

65
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:23,500
the Australians can do.

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,460
And knowing the risks of attempting to board a small boat with sharp obstacles at high

67
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,900
speed, the navy might decide to abandon the chase long before that line.

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,020
While arrests do happen, and are happening in record numbers, it's understood that

69
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,900
these only represent a small fraction of the incursions into Australian waters.

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,100
So Australia's well-protected fish stocks are being plundered.

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,540
Ultimately, though, they're being plundered by the plundered.

72
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,900
Indonesian fishers are not truly responsible for the downfall of their fishery—rather,

73
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,340
it was foreign vessels that trawled their ocean treasures.

74
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,780
Consider the country's neighbours.

75
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,820
According to the Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Index, which scores countries

76
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,460
and regions on their vulnerability to illegal practices, Indonesia itself ranks 20th in

77
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,060
the world, while its neighbors in the Pacific rank even worse.

78
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,680
Japan is 12th, South Korea is third, Russia is second, and then there's China.

79
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,040
Not only is China number one in the IUU fishing index, it reels in by far the most fish tonnage

80
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,100
year in, year out, and is home to by far the biggest fishing fleet in the world—effectively,

81
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,980
providing a recipe for overfishing at a global scale, on its own.

82
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,820
China's appetite for the ocean was born in the 1980s as personal income began an ascent

83
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,940
that is yet to meaningfully slow.

84
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,540
By 2000, after catch tonnage in China's EEZ had quadrupled, the nation's fisheries

85
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,220
were on the verge of collapse so state planners and struggling boat captains alike turned

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,540
their attention to foreign and contested waters—sometimes legally, other times not.

87
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,300
With their own fisheries in trouble, Indonesia tried to halt foreign fleets from entering

88
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,340
its waters in 2014.

89
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,660
The poaching vessels it caught, once processed, were publicly blown up or burned down at sea

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,460
as a show of force.

91
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,660
Yet, even in the face of potentially losing their vessels for good, Chinese boats were

92
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,020
identified in the hundreds across Indonesian waters in the wake of the policy—there were

93
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,700
simply too many for the cash-strapped country to possibly catch.

94
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,340
Their seas now plundered, Indonesian fishers turned their attention then towards Australia.

95
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,180
But the influence of China's massive, unwieldy, unregulated fishing force is felt far beyond

96
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,380
the Western Pacific.

97
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,460
China's also home to the world's largest distant water fleet—boats big enough and

98
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,380
capable enough to cross oceans, not just stick to coasts.

99
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,180
Exactly how big this fleet is, no one's quite sure, as some reports have estimated

100
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,500
the number in the 3000s, while more recent estimates have put it at 17,000.

101
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:56,220
Either way, it is massive, as the US distant water fleet, for comparison, is only 300 boats.

102
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,380
This Chinese armada has taken Asian-Pacific problems and exported them around the globe.

103
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,260
Take West Africa, for example.

104
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,940
Here, off the rich coast of Mauritania, south to Sierra Leone, Chinese companies have been

105
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,860
buying fishing licenses and fishing since the mid-1980s.

106
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,620
In the past decade, though, these parties—African governments and Chinese fishing companies—have

107
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,100
reached a reckoning point.

108
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,860
While the countries have offered specific catch quotas to fishing companies to protect

109
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,740
the nation's stock, local fishing communities have noticed an alarming lack of fish.

110
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,700
In Senegal, where a fifth of all people work in fishing, and some 85% of protein intake

111
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,140
is fish, this has destroyed jobs and created real food scarcity.

112
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,700
And it isn't due to over-allocating fishing licenses, but because Chinese ships report

113
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,060
only a paltry 8% of their actual catch along the African coasts.

114
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,620
For their part, Senegal has, at points, discontinued offering fishing licenses to foreign boats.

115
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,980
But this only does so much, as Senegal, nor developing countries like it, have the navy

116
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,820
or satellite tracking capabilities to enforce moratoriums.

117
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:05,660
And even when boats respect such fishing freezes, they still can simply move operations to the

118
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,580
edge of Senegal's exclusive economic zone, to international waters, continuing to fish

119
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,800
around the clock.

120
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,000
No matter where you look, these distant water fleets are crushing fisheries with little

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,440
regard for national or international rules.

122
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,840
Back in the Pacific, tracking services have followed Chinese fleets into North Korean

123
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
waters.

124
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,260
This likely explains why fragments of Korean ships have been mysteriously washing up on

125
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,920
Japanese beaches.

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:35,160
Local fishers can't compete in their own waters now dominated by Chinese ships so they've

127
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,200
gone farther out to sea where their small boats are battered and crews are sent overboard.

128
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,860
But beyond bullying local fishers, moving into this EEZ is another blatant disregard

129
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:49,120
for the rules, as they're ignoring UN sanctions that forbid fishing in North Korean waters

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
while simultaneously wiping out North Korea's fish population.

131
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,840
The pattern repeats on the high seas too, where international laws are looser to begin

132
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
with.

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,240
In recent years, Chinese fishing armadas have earned the ominous moniker of dark fleets

134
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,640
as they've suspiciously disabled their AIS tracking systems for days and weeks at a time.

135
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,160
This allows fishing vessels to sneak into EEZs, fish, then quietly slide back into international

136
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,920
waters where they turn their transponders back on.

137
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,560
It also allows fishing companies to launder their catch, as a fishing ship will go dark

138
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,800
and unload their catch onto larger transport ships, which muddies the water on where exactly

139
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,560
the catch originated, and allows the boat to illegally dump low-grade fish or move illegal

140
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,740
catches.

141
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,040
This is called transshipment, which, while legal when authorized by regional authorities,

142
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,920
is often done with transponders turned off.

143
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,520
But, while both sneaking into EEZs and unauthorized transshipments are illegal, both require evidence

144
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,960
to prove the fleets guilty.

145
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,680
While it's obvious that's what they're probably doing, someone needs to catch the

146
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,360
companies in the act, then catch the boats themselves—two tasks that are both extremely

147
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,040
expensive and extremely difficult in the endless expanse of the ocean.

148
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
So, it continues.

149
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
Small operators catch the fish they're not supposed to in places they're not supposed

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
to.

151
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,920
Small operators catch fish in too high a number or fish they aren't supposed to catch at

152
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,440
all, then launder their catch via shipping boats.

153
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
For all these reasons, one out of every five fish that ends up on a plate was illegally

154
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
caught.

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,060
But more importantly, it's why what's always been seen as an inexhaustible resource

156
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,240
is being increasingly pushed to the brink by a devastatingly, ruthlessly efficient machine.

157
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,680
And the existential threats posed to our oceans aren't just confined to fish populations

158
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,220
either.

159
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,300
The ocean's potential most valuable treasures may, in fact, serve not to nourish, but to

160
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,700
heal.

161
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,220
Traditional medicine has relied on plants and animals from the ocean for millennia,

162
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,920
but despite long-held diversion, modern medicine is now increasingly recognizing the value

163
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,580
of some of these treatments.

164
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,380
There's the drug called halivan, over $300 million in sales per year, that extends the

165
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,920
life of late-stage breast cancer patients by five or six months, and it's derived

166
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,460
from a Japanese sea sponge.

167
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,820
There's the drug called prialt, which is remarkably effective at treating severe chronic

168
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:07,540
pain, evades the downsides of opioids, and is based on the venom of sea-based cone snails.

169
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,660
And beyond these and more already in use, there are a dozen or so more marine-based

170
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,700
drugs currently making their way through clinical testing.

171
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,260
This makes sense—after all, there are countless drugs that leverage the compounds found in

172
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,960
land-based plants and animals for their healing properties, but the ocean is a far more biodiverse

173
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,640
place than land—a majority of Earth's biodiversity is in the ocean.

174
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,680
There are more distinct plants or animals that could be used for drugs, they just need

175
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,720
to be found.

176
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,880
The ocean is woefully underexplored—in fact, only about 10% of marine species are thought

177
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,040
to have even been discovered—but the difficulty of marine exploration and sampling is lowering

178
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:49,020
as more and more submersibles are being developed, and even more so as the costs of testing and

179
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,280
studying samples has cratered.

180
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,180
DNA sequencing, for example, is an important part of this, and whereas in 2001 it cost

181
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:02,480
over $5,000 to sequence a million bases, today that cost is down to almost half a cent.

182
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,800
Therefore, whereas today the use of these marine genetic resources is largely confined

183
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,880
to useful yet niche drugs, there is an expectation that due to increased exploration and research,

184
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,000
someday soon someone might identify a groundbreaking compound to treat a common illness and set

185
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,600
off a pharmaceutical gold rush in the world's oceans.

186
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,920
But a far more literal gold rush also sits on the ocean's horizon.

187
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,120
That's because down below, on its floor, are these—polymetallic nodules.

188
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,680
These are potato-sized clumps of metals.

189
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,760
It varies, but notably they include some valuable ones like manganese, zinc, cobalt, copper,

190
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,960
and nickel, and they're really just sitting there.

191
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,640
This is rather tantalizing, especially these days.

192
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,560
As the world looks to build more wind turbines, electric car batteries, and other bastions

193
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,320
of a decarbonized grid, these metals are in greater and greater demand.

194
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,680
There's going to have to be more production somewhere, and some argue that deep-sea mining

195
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,720
has the potential to develop into a low-cost, low-impact source compared to land-based mining.

196
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
Naturally, others disagree.

197
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,040
Collecting these nodules at scale, at least with current technology, requires significant

198
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,720
disturbance to the seafloor, which would inevitably destroy marine habitats and kick up huge plumes

199
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,440
of sediment that would impact surrounding sea life.

200
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,120
The ocean floor also stores large amounts of carbon, and so there's also a concern

201
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,380
that the disturbance could release the carbon up into the atmosphere, thereby further negating

202
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,720
any environmental benefit.

203
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,620
Right now, nobody's mining the ocean floor at commercial scale.

204
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,120
The International Seabed Authority, the UN body responsible for regulating such activity,

205
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,120
has only granted 31 exploratory licenses for small-scale tests.

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,440
But this could change very, very soon, thanks to the second section of the 15th paragraph

207
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,000
of the first annex of the 1994 agreement relating to the implementation of Part 11 of the United

208
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea.

209
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:58,280
What this essentially states is that, if an ISA member nation wants to start deep-sea

210
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,940
mining operations, the Authority has two years to set rules on how that can take place.

211
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,680
On July 9th, 2021, the nation of Nauru triggered that two-year countdown.

212
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,080
July 9th, 2023 has now come and gone, and the International Seabed Authority has failed

213
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,720
to set rules on deep-sea mining, meaning Nauru and all nations are now theoretically allowed

214
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,800
to start any sort of operations with absolutely zero environmental restrictions.

215
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:30,760
Now, given that the International Seabed Authority regulates international waters—the high

216
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,400
seas—Nauru would simply be the facilitator in a theoretical deep-sea mining operation—it

217
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,620
wouldn't happen in their waters.

218
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,940
As an ISA member nation, they're partnered with Canada-based The Metals Company, essentially

219
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,060
serving as a friendly government willing to submit a license application to the International

220
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,940
Seabed Authority on the company's behalf—presumably because larger governments, like Canada's,

221
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,900
are unwilling to be seen as the first to open the door to an environmentally destructive

222
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,020
process.

223
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,180
Once a license application is submitted by Nauru, it would then be reviewed by the ISA's

224
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,540
legal and technical commission on whether it meets the body's regulations—which

225
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,480
don't currently exist—which would issue a recommendation to the organization's thirty-six

226
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,000
member voting council.

227
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,440
But this is where things get tricky.

228
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,600
The council has told the legal and technical commission not to issue recommendations until

229
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,920
regulations are set to avoid having to vote on one, but a subset of members are arguing

230
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,600
that this is a violation of the law of the sea.

231
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,460
They say that the legal and technical commission's role is to examine compliance with whatever

232
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,440
the regulations are, and since there are no regulations, any application must be recommended

233
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,520
for approval.

234
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,420
No application has yet been submitted, but essentially, the authority is setting itself

235
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,440
up for a legal showdown.

236
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,720
There is no consensus on how their system is supposed to work, and therefore it's

237
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,000
at risk of breaking down.

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,300
Meanwhile, the body also seems deadlocked on the overall issue.

239
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,840
Some members, like Nauru and China, are fully in support of regulated but abundant deep-sea

240
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,220
mining, others, like Switzerland and Germany, are in support of a moratorium until further

241
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,720
study can be done on the practices' effects, while others still, like France, are already

242
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,200
in support of an outright ban on deep-sea mining, convinced that the gain is not worth

243
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
the cost.

244
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,160
But at the end of the day, it's tough to understand whether this matters at all because

245
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,680
some 30 or so nations are not even members of the ISA, and therefore aren't subject

246
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,960
to its rules.

247
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,080
This includes, most notably, the United States.

248
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,920
Its Senate voted not to ratify the treaty that would have led to ISA membership, with

249
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,000
many of those dissenting specifically citing the potential that the body would restrict

250
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,400
deep-sea mining operations that the country might want to permit.

251
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Therefore, the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has already granted

252
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,380
exploratory licenses to American companies, and while these aren't recognized by the

253
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,540
ISA, companies might use them as the authority on which to begin their operations in international

254
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
waters.

255
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:51,020
If the US decides to allow full-scale commercial operations, while the ISA does not, this could

256
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:56,140
kick off a showdown between the UN and US, as companies use American backing as the legal

257
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,260
authority on which to base their international operations.

258
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,980
At this point, what happens with deep-sea mining is still very much up in the air.

259
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,660
As for the management of the rest of the treasures abound in international waters,

260
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,660
though, some sort of systematic management might start with this—the Biodiversity Beyond

261
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:18,420
National Jurisdiction Treaty, or the Treaty of the High Seas, as it's become known.

262
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,680
While these 54 pages of term definitions, provisions, articles, and objectives didn't

263
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,900
make a major news splash, the agreement to the final draft at UN headquarters on March

264
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,300
4th, 2023 was a big deal.

265
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,980
Nearly 20 years in the making, the Treaty of the High Seas addresses something that

266
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,500
had slipped through the cracks in previous agreements involving international waters—nature

267
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
and natural resources.

268
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,040
This treaty sets a framework for sharing access to marine genetic resources between countries

269
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,520
in the form of samples, data, and sequencing—a framework for requiring environmental impact

270
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,700
assessment should one party consider another's activity potentially environmentally harmful,

271
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,220
and a groundwork to begin management of marine protected areas where all harvesting of resources

272
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,660
is strictly prohibited.

273
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,580
In other words, should something be harvested on the high seas for scientific purposes,

274
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,140
the findings will need to be shared, should a country launch a project on the high seas,

275
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,780
then others will have the right to first require an impact assessment, and should the UN reach

276
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:13,420
its goal for protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030, it will use the tools provided in the

277
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,060
document to make decisions on protected areas.

278
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,920
But for those concerned with the prospect of deep sea mining, the treaty has been seen

279
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,980
as a bit of a letdown, as it doesn't encompass high seas activities that already have their

280
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,080
own regulatory bodies like the ISA—a point that China has been unwilling to move off

281
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,960
of throughout negotiations.

282
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,820
But for the bigger picture, those concerned with the immediate future of ocean environments

283
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,080
in the face of major threats, this has been viewed as an unprecedented win, something

284
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,440
that hasn't been done before, and something that has the potential to fundamentally alter

285
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
the ocean's future.

286
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,360
But the treaty still has a long way to go.

287
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,200
With the draft agreed to in March, the agreement wasn't actually adopted until as recently

288
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,660
as June 20th, 2023 at the UN Intergovernmental Conference, and isn't expected to open for

289
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,840
nation signatures until September, at which point it will become law two months after

290
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,120
the 60th country has ratified it.

291
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,440
With the EU, US, and China all playing roles in negotiating the treaty, it's expected

292
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,940
that all the major players in international waters will ratify sooner or later.

293
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,980
But even then, once ratified, should nothing go wrong, it's still an international treaty—a

294
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,180
style of agreement that's hardly proved the end-all be-all in regards to environmental

295
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,180
efforts.

296
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,260
With sovereign states looking out for their own interests first and foremost, these agreements

297
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,100
are usually backed as long as they're convenient.

298
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,840
Look no further than the Paris Agreement being hamstrung by countries choosing their own

299
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,120
emissions cuts, and scaling back their own commitments after signing.

300
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,360
And also look no further than the Paris Agreement as an example of a treaty becoming so overly

301
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,220
politicized that the US withdrew from it entirely at one point.

302
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,880
International treaties work when they don't get in the way of state interest, but they

303
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,440
become much harder to uphold once it conflicts with the immediate interests of a nation,

304
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,920
or worse still, happens to benefit one over the other.

305
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,580
Perhaps the most potentially damning, though, is the issue of enforcement.

306
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,880
In the most simple terms, the UN doesn't have a navy, the oceans are impossibly vast,

307
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,980
and nations have struggled to protect their own exclusive economic zones from poaching

308
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,500
the world over, let alone the open seas.

309
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,240
There may be buy-in now, but enforcing compliance and regulating the high seas will ultimately

310
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,320
inform the success and impact of the treaty.

311
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,460
The prospect of unregulated deep-sea mining feels existential—it feels like something

312
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,180
that could permanently alter perhaps the most pristine areas on the planet, the final

313
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,940
corners untouched by human hands.

314
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,980
But this existential threat has already been realized.

315
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,620
The transition from small-scale to industrial fishing has wreaked havoc on the oceans.

316
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,420
A third of global fish stocks are being overfished, meaning fish are being removed faster than

317
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,880
they reproduce.

318
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
Another 60% is being fished at the reproduction rate.

319
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,280
Only no fish stocks are growing globally, and all of these statistics are trending further

320
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,860
and further towards oblivion.

321
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,680
There is enormous economic incentive for individual actors to continue to fish as much as they

322
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
can.

323
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,840
This is the tragedy of the commons, and while this problem can be solved on a national level,

324
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,680
the world has yet to find a true, long-term solution to solving this internationally.

325
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,660
When each nation has to opt into regulating itself, the tragedy of the commons stays alive.

326
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,500
Individual actors will choose to follow the economic incentives and opt themselves out.

327
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,520
To date, fishing is perhaps the most tangible manifestation of this problem.

328
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,220
In modern times, there aren't many other resources that can be pulled from an environment

329
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,820
so devoid of rules, regulations, or repercussions.

330
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,320
But technological development threatens to open up new categories with the same problems,

331
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,940
and not only in the oceans—there's also the entire rest of the universe.

332
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:54,720
outer space operates under the same system—its laws are based on maritime law, and therefore

333
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,420
face the same shortcomings.

334
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,680
Asteroid mining is a near-direct analogy of deep-sea mining in terms of the legal and

335
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,020
environmental conundrums it cracks open.

336
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,140
There's little understanding of how the world will effectively regulate such a practice,

337
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,100
and like with deep-sea mining, marine pharmacology, and more, there's reason to be pessimistic

338
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,940
when looking at fishing as precedent.

339
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,900
As the world globalizes and technology advances, problems and potential are growing increasingly

340
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,740
beyond national scale, so one must find ways to use the age-old practice of diplomacy to

341
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,660
build cooperation and consensus for the good of all, over the good of one.

342
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,180
And perhaps the best problem to solve first is not the hypothetical, but the one that

343
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,180
exists now—right in front of us.

344
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,180
Solve the fish, and then maybe we can solve the future.

345
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,420
You might be surprised to hear just how much more of a problem this ship is than this one—I

346
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,380
certainly was when researching this topic—but big industrial ships like this have become

347
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,460
just ruthlessly efficient.

348
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,820
In fact, this one ship once hauled in almost a quarter of the UK's entire annual fishing

349
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,820
quota.

350
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:04,100
It is just amazing how much this process has been optimized, and while there wasn't time

351
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,880
to get much into how industrial fishing works in this video, I still wanted to learn more

352
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,120
about it, so we made an entire episode of our Nebula-exclusive series, The Logistics

353
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,360
of X, on fishing.

354
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,800
Every few Wendover videos, we make one of these diving deeper into the logistics of

355
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,700
the video's topic—we've done one on ski resorts, search and rescue, and we already

356
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,440
have more in production—and the fishing episode is perhaps the most fascinating one

357
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,280
yet—I just never knew how much complexity there was behind the fish that we all ultimately

358
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,840
eat, and of course this is just one small part of the huge catalogue of Nebula originals.

359
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,580
All sorts of creators, like us, Real Engineering, Polymatter, Neo, Mustard, Real Life Lore,

360
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,340
and so many more have made shows, documentaries, films, plays, and more with the bigger budgets

361
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,040
Nebula is able to offer.

362
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,780
This is thanks to the funding that comes in through Nebula subscribers who, in addition

363
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,860
to getting access to these, also get to watch all their creators' regular videos early

364
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,400
and ad-free.

365
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,100
Subscribing to Nebula is a great way of supporting independent creators and helps to build this

366
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,860
new revenue source for them through producing higher-budget content while also giving them

367
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,540
the financial stability that allows for scaling up production for YouTube.

368
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:12,140
This is especially true since when you sign up at our link, Nebula.tv-slash-Wendover will

369
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,260
get a portion of your subscription fee for as long as you stay subscribed, and you'll

370
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,620
get 40% off an annual subscription, which brings the cost down to just $2.50 a month.

371
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,860
Basically, it's a great deal for both of us, so if you want to watch the logistics

372
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,020
of X and help support the channel, once again, head to Nebula.tv-slash-Wendover, and thanks,

373
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,540
in advance, for your support.
