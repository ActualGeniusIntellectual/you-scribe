1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,580
To some people, representation in media or entertainment is important, and I understand

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,580
why.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,080
If you're a black kid growing up in the 50s, watching a bunch of TV shows with only

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,900
white people in them, it's reasonable to feel a bit alienated from your own culture.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:21,180
In that era, television presented stereotypically normal families, and those families were all

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,660
entirely white, straight, and functional.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,060
Unlike a progressive might say, I'm not saying this is a bad thing.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,140
It's good when a society models what a functional family unit looks like in its storytelling.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,540
But black families weren't modeled in that way in that era.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,640
As a general rule, black people in this era's stories were servants or comedic relief characters,

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,120
not really treated poorly by the white cast, but also not on equal footing.

12
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,420
They were the happy servant.

13
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,200
Again, unlike a progressive, I'm not going to focus too heavily on the moral component

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,580
of changing the state of affairs.

15
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,000
There certainly was one, but the capitalist component was arguably a more central force.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,480
The black desire to see themselves represented in a positive light within the media they

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,680
consume was a gap in the market.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,520
There was money to be made there, and I would argue that that money drove a lot of the change.

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,440
The first TV show to truly show a black person in an equal, well-respected role was Star

20
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Trek in 1967 with Lt. Uhura, and it's a well-known story by now that when the recently departed

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,220
Nichelle Nichols wanted to leave Star Trek, Martin Luther King Jr. talked her out of it,

22
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,680
saying to her that, for the first time on television, we will be seen as we should be

23
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,440
seen every day, as intelligent, quality, beautiful people who can sing, dance, and

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,800
go to space, who are professors, lawyers.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,760
Uhura, in her position as communications officer of the USS Enterprise, was treated as a competent,

26
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,960
respected equal by the other members of the ship.

27
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,560
This had never been done before with a black character in 1967.

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,860
One of the downstream effects of Uhura's positive black representation was that the

29
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,320
70s and 80s saw the creation of the black sitcom, where black families could also be

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,080
modeled as functional and loving like white families had been.

31
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,680
Stanford and Son, The Jeffersons, and The Cosby Show are all ones that I remember watching

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,080
reruns of as a kid in the 90s, though I will say that mentioning that last one is a little

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,340
bit weird nowadays.

34
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,760
One of the most successful sitcoms of all time was a black sitcom, The Fresh Prince

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
of Bel-Air.

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,960
The point I'm getting at is, the left is correct when they say that representation

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,240
matters, at least up to a point.

38
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,880
Sometimes as a kid, you need somebody else to model what it's like to be a successful

39
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,600
version of yourself, especially if the adults in your life aren't doing it.

40
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,500
However, keep in mind that I'm talking about a period of time ranging from 40 to 70 years

41
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,720
ago at this point.

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,120
This is not a problem that we have anymore, at least for black people, and yet, the representation

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
machine marches on.

44
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,000
Consider the shit show surrounding Moses Ingram in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,620
It's important to us that when we turn on the TV, we see the world that we live in reflected

46
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
back to us.

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,380
Obi-Wan Kenobi is the most diverse Star Wars project.

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,560
If you've got talking droids and aliens, but no people of color, it doesn't make

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,560
any sense.

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,000
She's talking like it's still the 60s, but a lot of these issues have been solved.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,200
I don't care that Reva was written to be a black woman, she's a new character, that's

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
fine.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Write what you want to write.

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,240
She knows that the character isn't very good, but people call you a racist for saying

55
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,240
that.

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,580
However, when you start to change the story for the sake of representation, especially

57
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,120
for a problem solved before I was even born, it starts to appear ideological.

58
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,920
Like for example, casting a black man in Netflix's Resident Evil series to play Wesker, who was

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,120
specifically made white and blonde by the Japanese game developers to give him a bit

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,460
of an Aryan feel.

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,060
Or how in the new Magic the Gathering set featuring Lord of the Rings characters, they

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,580
made Aragorn black, even though black people come from a specific foreign kingdom in Lord

63
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,160
of the Rings and would not be the kings of Gondor.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,740
Or how in the House of the Dragon, Corus Velaryon is played by a black man, simply because in

65
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,860
the lore, the sea snake is described as being tan-skinned in comparison to the pale skin

66
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,260
of your average Westerosi, with some pictures singling him out as slightly darker than his

67
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
peers.

68
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,140
And they really wanted to stretch that description out to hit the diversity quota.

69
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,860
In fact, Lord Corlys' daughter, Daella, is described as screaming in fright upon seeing

70
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,340
a black man for the first time, a prince from the Summer Isles, mistaking him for a

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,980
demon because of his skin color.

72
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,720
Now why in the hell would this girl scream upon seeing a black man?

73
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,060
The issue most people have with representation isn't that they just hate minorities, but

74
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,740
rather that one, creators nowadays seem to be willing to harm the integrity of their

75
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,460
own world-building in the service of representation.

76
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:05,880
And two, there's at least some correlation between creators willing to shoehorn in representation

77
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,580
and creators making low-quality work.

78
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,200
Here's an example of what I mean.

79
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Last of Us 2 sucks.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,500
No, I don't care what you have to say, Econoboi, it sucks.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,640
In the game, you can find a trans flag hanging in an apartment, pride flags on lamp posts,

82
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,840
and a pride crosswalk.

83
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,340
This is a post-apocalyptic game, so yeah, it makes sense that these things would just

84
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,400
be left over.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Except it doesn't.

86
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,960
In the timeline of the series, the zombie apocalypse began in late September, early

87
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,040
October of 2013.

88
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,380
That's why, for example, you can often find Halloween stuff around the game.

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,920
There wouldn't be Pride Month stuff in October when Pride Month is June.

90
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,040
Moreover, back in 2013, Pride was still largely relegated to parades.

91
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,540
It wasn't yet common to see pride crosswalks or pride flags lining streets by the dozens

92
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,640
for a full month.

93
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,620
And the trans flag wasn't common either, even at Pride events.

94
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,200
When I was playing Last of Us 2, this stuff took me out of the experience.

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,760
Not because I'm a homophobe or a transphobe, but because I recognized pretty quickly that

96
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,380
this stuff wouldn't really be there.

97
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,300
It was placed there by the game dev as a way to virtue signal.

98
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,140
Last of Us 2 sucked for a lot of reasons unrelated to the flags.

99
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,460
The flags didn't make the game suck, but the flags informed us that it probably would.

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,540
At some point, this sort of representation just becomes a joke.

101
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,380
Like they're mocking us for having to put up with this shit, and mocking the very people

102
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,940
they represent for using them as pawns to make themselves look better and sell more

103
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,940
product.

104
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,300
Disney's string of first openly gay characters has gone on for so long it's a fucking joke

105
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,300
nowadays.

106
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,260
It's not progressive if all you're doing is progressing to the spot that liberals reached

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,280
20 years ago, and you're doing it so tepidly that it can be easily edited out for the Middle

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,940
East and Chinese releases.

109
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:37,220
The counterpart to media representation is IRL representation, and at this point this

110
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,740
stuff becomes a lot more insidious.

111
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,740
Pick any field at all, and you'll find some prog somewhere crying about how it needs to

112
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,420
be diversified, how there's too many straight white men involved, how their voices are heard

113
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,940
too often, and how minorities need to be placed at the forefront of these domains.

114
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,260
It doesn't matter that people in these positions got there meritocratically if the hiring process

115
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,900
or whatever was colorblind, because not seeing race and hard work and punctuality are all

116
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,260
tools of whiteness.

117
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,140
And demanding minorities adhere to those standards is a colonizer mindset.

118
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,340
This attitude is best described by Audre Lorde, a black radical intersectional socialist activist.

119
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,940
For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.

120
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,400
They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable

121
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,260
us to bring about genuine change.

122
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:20,860
Racism and homophobia are real conditions of all of our lives in this place and time.

123
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,100
I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself

124
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220
and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there.

125
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,060
See whose face it wears.

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,260
Again, the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all of our choices.

127
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,340
Everything I've been talking about on this channel in the past few months, it's all here

128
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,340
in this quote.

129
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,060
That totalitarian, everything is political view where there is no conception of a private

130
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
life.

131
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:46,180
Subversion of institutions with the purpose of dismantling them and building a revolution.

132
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,740
Pinning any sort of doubt or deviation from the struggle as internalized racism, homophobia

133
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,800
or misogyny.

134
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,820
This is the reason why progressives are so happy to be racist, sexist, homophobic or

135
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,260
transphobic to minority individuals who don't follow their politics.

136
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,580
Being black or gay or trans requires an ideological commitment, not simply being the thing.

137
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,200
In other words, you're not really gay if you don't engage in the most degenerate fucking

138
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
garbage imaginable.

139
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,380
You're not really trans if you're not also a socialist sex worker who spends every waking

140
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,900
moment subverting the gender binary.

141
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,080
You're not really black if you act white by graduating school, getting married before

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,820
having kids, or building a stable home and family life.

143
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,260
It's all bullshit of course.

144
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,080
It's worshipping dysfunction because the dominant culture is largely a functional one

145
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,120
and they want to remain the counterculture even if it destroys the very people they claim

146
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,380
to advocate for.

147
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,400
At this point, we've completely flipped around 180 on what the purpose of representation

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
was.

149
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,420
When it was Star Trek and the Jeffersons and Fresh Prince, it was meant to show that even

150
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,480
though you're different, you can make it too.

151
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,100
You're not doomed to a life of dysfunction and depression simply because of your difference.

152
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,880
But nowadays, representation seems to worship that dysfunction and depression, making it

153
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,400
more integral to the minority experience than actually being a minority to the point that

154
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,460
successful minorities are Uncle Toms, counter-revolutionaries, collaborators, traitors, and of course for

155
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,040
pointing this out, I'm already a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, fascist,

156
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,880
reactionary, blah blah blah blah blah.

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,240
So is anybody else who notices the elephant in the room.

158
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,400
I don't really care though.

159
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,680
If an idiot thinks that I'm a racist, why should I take his opinion seriously?

160
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
He's an idiot.

161
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm not a reactionary for thinking that 90s cartoons handled racism way better than

162
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,200
the liquid shit being sprayed onto TV today.

163
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,640
I mean, just compare these two clips real quick.

164
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey Dad, this is my friend Virgil.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,640
Remember, I told you about him.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,480
Not nearly enough.

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:32,000
And now I see why Richie acts like a hoot, Maggie.

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,880
That kid's a bad influence.

169
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
All his kind are.

170
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,440
Keep your voice down.

171
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,520
It's bad enough I gotta deal with them all day long.

172
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,200
Now one of them's in my house.

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,280
You're still early.

174
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,240
I can go home without calling my pops for a ride.

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
Virgil, don't leave.

176
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,240
Please.

177
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,840
I talked to my mom.

178
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
What good is that going to do, Rich?

179
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
She can't change what he said.

180
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
You were right all along.

181
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Hanging here was a bad idea.

182
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Sorry.

183
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
Black people can't marry white people.

184
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,840
Hey now.

185
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,840
It's Garnet from Steven Universe.

186
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,840
Kids, don't be racist.

187
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:14,440
But when it comes to real life representation and not just media representation, there's

188
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,720
the added issue of replacism to consider.

189
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
I don't strictly mean that great replacement stuff, though it certainly falls under this

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,160
umbrella.

191
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,280
We're talking about voting populations in a country getting replaced with immigrants

192
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,240
because the native population refuses to rubber stamp government initiatives, something that

193
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
the left openly likes to celebrate.

194
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,280
It's just proof that to the ruling class, the electorate is fungible and should be switched

195
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,200
out until they get with the program.

196
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:41,600
White British population has decreased by 600,000, while the minority population has

197
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,120
increased by 1.2 million.

198
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,600
So yes lads, we're winning.

199
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,640
Remember the whole Bridget thing recently, where solely for political points people online

200
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,400
really wanted Guilty Gear's Bridget to be trans and it erupted into a big fight with

201
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,800
a few people going mask off and saying that they don't actually care about the integrity

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,620
of the lore or the story or the characters of Guilty Gear, they just want the good righteous

203
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,520
trans community to get wins over the evil transphobic femme boys?

204
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,640
These people are desperate to invalidate cis men's expressions of femininity.

205
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,480
They want every feminine guy character to be trans, especially if they're famous,

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,560
because that means representation and validation in political power.

207
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,440
And when this attitude crosses over from something silly like representation and Guilty Gear into

208
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,320
the real world, you start to have some very toxic behaviors, like where trans activists

209
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,480
bully feminine gay men into coming out as trans women because their existence as feminine

210
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,480
gay men is offensive towards the trans experience.

211
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:39,240
Putting aside the obviously abusive and destructive component of this behavior, this is also replacism.

212
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,960
If feminine gay men, femme boys, traps, whatever you want to call them, if their existence

213
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,880
is offensive towards trans people, and if you can force all of them to be trans, then

214
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,060
the source of the offense has been replaced with something that is positive to their movement.

215
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:55,000
All those articles from earlier talking about jobs wanting only minorities and how industries

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,120
need to have more diverse representation?

217
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,760
Well there's only so many jobs or university spots or whatever, at least in the short term,

218
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,360
it takes time to increase the capacity of those things.

219
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,520
For example, that one article talking about how farming in Britain needs to be diversified?

220
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,080
Well there's only so much land in the UK, how do you propose to make farming more diverse?

221
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,760
The only possible answer is to replace the current farmers with more diverse ones.

222
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,640
In this way, diversity is replacism.

223
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,760
As long as the total number of spots within any domain is fixed, you will always have

224
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,300
to remove the old to make space for the new.

225
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,080
And if you can expand the system, if you can add new slots, you will always be disqualifying

226
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,160
appropriate candidates based on their mutable characteristics in the name of diversity.

227
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,320
In order to represent group A in position 1, you necessarily cannot represent group

228
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,740
B in position 1, there's no two ways about it.

229
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:46,480
That being said, with today's if I identify as it, I am it attitude, it's not hard to

230
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,420
fudge the rules to your own advantage.

231
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,120
For example, in Canada's far left political party, the NDP, there's a standing rule

232
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,280
that any departing NDP candidate needs to be replaced with a minority, for the good

233
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,600
of diversity and inclusion, representation and equality and all of it.

234
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
Jerry Taft, a white man, beat out Spring Hawes for a nomination, and Hawes, a disabled woman,

235
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,400
put the party on blast for choosing a white man over her.

236
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,220
Taft simply said publicly, I'm bisexual and everybody shut up.

237
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,860
So if you happen to be a white guy in a committed relationship with a woman, and you've got

238
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,780
some diversity related problems, just claim that you got drunk and sucked a dick back

239
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,760
in college, and you'll be right as rain.

240
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,180
This whole thing is fully retarded by the way.

241
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:25,320
Representation and diversity and all the rest of it.

242
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,060
Representation went from modeling for an underclass of people what it looks like when they actually

243
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,860
made something of themselves, in a time where they desperately needed role models and had

244
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,860
nowhere to turn.

245
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,460
To a farce where everybody scrambles for the most oppression points in order to get a job

246
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:42,140
or a spot in a program that they're woefully unqualified for because hiring based on merit

247
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,060
is now considered a bigoted act.

248
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,540
First of all, this change has actually harmed the very classes of people it was meant to

249
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
help.

250
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,320
For example, the data on diversity quotas in schools is in.

251
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,020
When a university implements a rule where black people who are otherwise unqualified

252
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,300
are let in anyway, it's true that black enrollment goes up.

253
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,740
But black dropouts also go up because the people they let in can't learn or compete

254
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,180
effectively at that level.

255
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,500
Instead of going into a school or a program that they could actually succeed in, they

256
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,020
become dropouts saddled with debt, reinforcing negative stereotypes about black youth.

257
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,380
This is a concept called academic mismatch.

258
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:19,740
And although the data has been rock solid on it for a decade now, people are still forging

259
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:23,960
ahead with policies intended to help minorities that only make the problem worse.

260
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,160
And they do it because they are ideologically blinded.

261
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,140
There was once a very good reason to push for representation.

262
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,300
There was a real issue there.

263
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,980
And in some select domains, for some specific types of people, it still may be an issue.

264
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,520
But this isn't the 1950s.

265
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,620
Nobody's out there anymore saying that women can't earn their own money, or disabled

266
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,820
people can't contribute to society, or gay people have to be weird, pedo, age-spreading

267
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,260
degenerates, or black people are too dumb for school.

268
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,660
Nowadays people can do whatever they want.

269
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
Hey, wait a minute.

270
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,220
There are people saying all that shit.

271
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,220
It's the left.

272
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,740
They think disabled people can't contribute.

273
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,900
It's why they want them to be paid for, for life, rather than letting disabled people

274
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,200
contribute in their own way and have some dignity by standing on their own two feet.

275
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,140
They think LGBT people are weird degenerates and that being a weird degenerate is a core

276
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,600
component of being queer.

277
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,540
And if you're gay or trans, but you're not a weird degenerate, then you're a traitor

278
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
to the cause.

279
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,160
They think that black people are too dumb for school.

280
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,020
That's why they've implemented diversity quotas.

281
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,440
This is what representation is in the modern era.

282
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,740
It's just bigotry.

283
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,140
It's kind of like Sargon said all those years ago.

284
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,220
I'm in favor of making things more equal.

285
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,220
Okay, but I'm not.

286
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,060
I'm making things more free.

287
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,220
And freedom naturally will cause inequality.

288
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,200
Freedom entails discrimination.

289
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,020
Freedom allows white men to control everything.

290
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,920
Oh my God, you're a white supremacist.

291
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,000
You are actually a white supremacist with a guilty conscience on us.

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Jesus Christ.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,880
Honestly, this is, this is like...
