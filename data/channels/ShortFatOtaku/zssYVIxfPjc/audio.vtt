00:00.000 --> 00:09.580
To some people, representation in media or entertainment is important, and I understand

00:09.580 --> 00:10.580
why.

00:10.580 --> 00:13.080
If you're a black kid growing up in the 50s, watching a bunch of TV shows with only

00:13.080 --> 00:16.900
white people in them, it's reasonable to feel a bit alienated from your own culture.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.180
In that era, television presented stereotypically normal families, and those families were all

00:21.180 --> 00:23.660
entirely white, straight, and functional.

00:23.660 --> 00:27.060
Unlike a progressive might say, I'm not saying this is a bad thing.

00:27.060 --> 00:31.140
It's good when a society models what a functional family unit looks like in its storytelling.

00:31.140 --> 00:34.540
But black families weren't modeled in that way in that era.

00:34.540 --> 00:39.640
As a general rule, black people in this era's stories were servants or comedic relief characters,

00:39.640 --> 00:43.120
not really treated poorly by the white cast, but also not on equal footing.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.420
They were the happy servant.

00:44.420 --> 00:48.200
Again, unlike a progressive, I'm not going to focus too heavily on the moral component

00:48.200 --> 00:49.580
of changing the state of affairs.

00:49.580 --> 00:54.000
There certainly was one, but the capitalist component was arguably a more central force.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.480
The black desire to see themselves represented in a positive light within the media they

00:57.480 --> 00:59.680
consume was a gap in the market.

00:59.680 --> 01:03.520
There was money to be made there, and I would argue that that money drove a lot of the change.

01:03.520 --> 01:07.440
The first TV show to truly show a black person in an equal, well-respected role was Star

01:07.440 --> 01:12.280
Trek in 1967 with Lt. Uhura, and it's a well-known story by now that when the recently departed

01:12.280 --> 01:16.220
Nichelle Nichols wanted to leave Star Trek, Martin Luther King Jr. talked her out of it,

01:16.220 --> 01:19.680
saying to her that, for the first time on television, we will be seen as we should be

01:19.680 --> 01:24.440
seen every day, as intelligent, quality, beautiful people who can sing, dance, and

01:24.440 --> 01:26.800
go to space, who are professors, lawyers.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.760
Uhura, in her position as communications officer of the USS Enterprise, was treated as a competent,

01:31.760 --> 01:33.960
respected equal by the other members of the ship.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.560
This had never been done before with a black character in 1967.

01:37.560 --> 01:40.860
One of the downstream effects of Uhura's positive black representation was that the

01:40.860 --> 01:44.320
70s and 80s saw the creation of the black sitcom, where black families could also be

01:44.320 --> 01:47.080
modeled as functional and loving like white families had been.

01:47.080 --> 01:50.680
Stanford and Son, The Jeffersons, and The Cosby Show are all ones that I remember watching

01:50.680 --> 01:54.080
reruns of as a kid in the 90s, though I will say that mentioning that last one is a little

01:54.080 --> 01:55.340
bit weird nowadays.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.760
One of the most successful sitcoms of all time was a black sitcom, The Fresh Prince

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
of Bel-Air.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.960
The point I'm getting at is, the left is correct when they say that representation

02:02.960 --> 02:05.240
matters, at least up to a point.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.880
Sometimes as a kid, you need somebody else to model what it's like to be a successful

02:07.880 --> 02:11.600
version of yourself, especially if the adults in your life aren't doing it.

02:11.600 --> 02:15.500
However, keep in mind that I'm talking about a period of time ranging from 40 to 70 years

02:15.500 --> 02:16.720
ago at this point.

02:16.760 --> 02:21.120
This is not a problem that we have anymore, at least for black people, and yet, the representation

02:21.120 --> 02:22.680
machine marches on.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.000
Consider the shit show surrounding Moses Ingram in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.620
It's important to us that when we turn on the TV, we see the world that we live in reflected

02:29.620 --> 02:30.620
back to us.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.380
Obi-Wan Kenobi is the most diverse Star Wars project.

02:33.380 --> 02:36.560
If you've got talking droids and aliens, but no people of color, it doesn't make

02:36.560 --> 02:37.560
any sense.

02:37.560 --> 02:41.000
She's talking like it's still the 60s, but a lot of these issues have been solved.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.200
I don't care that Reva was written to be a black woman, she's a new character, that's

02:44.200 --> 02:45.200
fine.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.200
Write what you want to write.

02:46.200 --> 02:49.240
She knows that the character isn't very good, but people call you a racist for saying

02:49.240 --> 02:50.240
that.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.580
However, when you start to change the story for the sake of representation, especially

02:53.580 --> 02:58.120
for a problem solved before I was even born, it starts to appear ideological.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.920
Like for example, casting a black man in Netflix's Resident Evil series to play Wesker, who was

03:02.920 --> 03:07.120
specifically made white and blonde by the Japanese game developers to give him a bit

03:07.120 --> 03:08.460
of an Aryan feel.

03:08.460 --> 03:12.060
Or how in the new Magic the Gathering set featuring Lord of the Rings characters, they

03:12.060 --> 03:16.580
made Aragorn black, even though black people come from a specific foreign kingdom in Lord

03:16.580 --> 03:19.160
of the Rings and would not be the kings of Gondor.

03:19.160 --> 03:23.740
Or how in the House of the Dragon, Corus Velaryon is played by a black man, simply because in

03:23.740 --> 03:28.860
the lore, the sea snake is described as being tan-skinned in comparison to the pale skin

03:28.860 --> 03:33.260
of your average Westerosi, with some pictures singling him out as slightly darker than his

03:33.260 --> 03:34.260
peers.

03:34.260 --> 03:37.140
And they really wanted to stretch that description out to hit the diversity quota.

03:37.140 --> 03:41.860
In fact, Lord Corlys' daughter, Daella, is described as screaming in fright upon seeing

03:41.860 --> 03:45.340
a black man for the first time, a prince from the Summer Isles, mistaking him for a

03:45.340 --> 03:46.980
demon because of his skin color.

03:46.980 --> 03:50.720
Now why in the hell would this girl scream upon seeing a black man?

03:50.720 --> 03:55.060
The issue most people have with representation isn't that they just hate minorities, but

03:55.060 --> 03:58.740
rather that one, creators nowadays seem to be willing to harm the integrity of their

03:58.740 --> 04:01.460
own world-building in the service of representation.

04:01.460 --> 04:05.880
And two, there's at least some correlation between creators willing to shoehorn in representation

04:05.880 --> 04:07.580
and creators making low-quality work.

04:07.580 --> 04:09.200
Here's an example of what I mean.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.200
Last of Us 2 sucks.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.500
No, I don't care what you have to say, Econoboi, it sucks.

04:12.500 --> 04:16.640
In the game, you can find a trans flag hanging in an apartment, pride flags on lamp posts,

04:16.640 --> 04:17.840
and a pride crosswalk.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.340
This is a post-apocalyptic game, so yeah, it makes sense that these things would just

04:21.340 --> 04:22.400
be left over.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.400
Except it doesn't.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.960
In the timeline of the series, the zombie apocalypse began in late September, early

04:26.960 --> 04:29.040
October of 2013.

04:29.040 --> 04:32.380
That's why, for example, you can often find Halloween stuff around the game.

04:32.380 --> 04:35.920
There wouldn't be Pride Month stuff in October when Pride Month is June.

04:35.920 --> 04:40.040
Moreover, back in 2013, Pride was still largely relegated to parades.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.540
It wasn't yet common to see pride crosswalks or pride flags lining streets by the dozens

04:44.540 --> 04:45.640
for a full month.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.620
And the trans flag wasn't common either, even at Pride events.

04:48.620 --> 04:52.200
When I was playing Last of Us 2, this stuff took me out of the experience.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.760
Not because I'm a homophobe or a transphobe, but because I recognized pretty quickly that

04:55.760 --> 04:57.380
this stuff wouldn't really be there.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.300
It was placed there by the game dev as a way to virtue signal.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.140
Last of Us 2 sucked for a lot of reasons unrelated to the flags.

05:03.140 --> 05:07.460
The flags didn't make the game suck, but the flags informed us that it probably would.

05:07.460 --> 05:10.540
At some point, this sort of representation just becomes a joke.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.380
Like they're mocking us for having to put up with this shit, and mocking the very people

05:13.380 --> 05:16.940
they represent for using them as pawns to make themselves look better and sell more

05:16.940 --> 05:17.940
product.

05:17.940 --> 05:22.300
Disney's string of first openly gay characters has gone on for so long it's a fucking joke

05:22.300 --> 05:23.300
nowadays.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.260
It's not progressive if all you're doing is progressing to the spot that liberals reached

05:27.260 --> 05:31.280
20 years ago, and you're doing it so tepidly that it can be easily edited out for the Middle

05:31.280 --> 05:32.940
East and Chinese releases.

05:32.940 --> 05:37.220
The counterpart to media representation is IRL representation, and at this point this

05:37.220 --> 05:39.740
stuff becomes a lot more insidious.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.740
Pick any field at all, and you'll find some prog somewhere crying about how it needs to

05:43.740 --> 05:47.420
be diversified, how there's too many straight white men involved, how their voices are heard

05:47.420 --> 05:50.940
too often, and how minorities need to be placed at the forefront of these domains.

05:50.940 --> 05:54.260
It doesn't matter that people in these positions got there meritocratically if the hiring process

05:54.260 --> 05:58.900
or whatever was colorblind, because not seeing race and hard work and punctuality are all

05:58.900 --> 06:00.260
tools of whiteness.

06:00.260 --> 06:04.140
And demanding minorities adhere to those standards is a colonizer mindset.

06:04.140 --> 06:09.340
This attitude is best described by Audre Lorde, a black radical intersectional socialist activist.

06:09.340 --> 06:11.940
For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.

06:11.940 --> 06:15.400
They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable

06:15.400 --> 06:17.260
us to bring about genuine change.

06:17.260 --> 06:20.860
Racism and homophobia are real conditions of all of our lives in this place and time.

06:20.860 --> 06:25.100
I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself

06:25.100 --> 06:28.220
and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there.

06:28.220 --> 06:30.060
See whose face it wears.

06:30.060 --> 06:34.260
Again, the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all of our choices.

06:34.260 --> 06:37.340
Everything I've been talking about on this channel in the past few months, it's all here

06:37.340 --> 06:38.340
in this quote.

06:38.340 --> 06:42.060
That totalitarian, everything is political view where there is no conception of a private

06:42.060 --> 06:43.060
life.

06:43.060 --> 06:46.180
Subversion of institutions with the purpose of dismantling them and building a revolution.

06:46.180 --> 06:50.740
Pinning any sort of doubt or deviation from the struggle as internalized racism, homophobia

06:50.740 --> 06:51.800
or misogyny.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.820
This is the reason why progressives are so happy to be racist, sexist, homophobic or

06:55.820 --> 06:59.260
transphobic to minority individuals who don't follow their politics.

06:59.260 --> 07:04.580
Being black or gay or trans requires an ideological commitment, not simply being the thing.

07:04.580 --> 07:08.200
In other words, you're not really gay if you don't engage in the most degenerate fucking

07:08.200 --> 07:09.200
garbage imaginable.

07:09.200 --> 07:13.380
You're not really trans if you're not also a socialist sex worker who spends every waking

07:13.380 --> 07:14.900
moment subverting the gender binary.

07:14.900 --> 07:19.080
You're not really black if you act white by graduating school, getting married before

07:19.080 --> 07:21.820
having kids, or building a stable home and family life.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.260
It's all bullshit of course.

07:23.260 --> 07:27.080
It's worshipping dysfunction because the dominant culture is largely a functional one

07:27.080 --> 07:31.120
and they want to remain the counterculture even if it destroys the very people they claim

07:31.120 --> 07:32.380
to advocate for.

07:32.380 --> 07:36.400
At this point, we've completely flipped around 180 on what the purpose of representation

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
was.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.420
When it was Star Trek and the Jeffersons and Fresh Prince, it was meant to show that even

07:40.420 --> 07:42.480
though you're different, you can make it too.

07:42.480 --> 07:46.100
You're not doomed to a life of dysfunction and depression simply because of your difference.

07:46.100 --> 07:49.880
But nowadays, representation seems to worship that dysfunction and depression, making it

07:49.880 --> 07:54.400
more integral to the minority experience than actually being a minority to the point that

07:54.400 --> 07:59.460
successful minorities are Uncle Toms, counter-revolutionaries, collaborators, traitors, and of course for

07:59.460 --> 08:04.040
pointing this out, I'm already a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, fascist,

08:04.040 --> 08:05.880
reactionary, blah blah blah blah blah.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.240
So is anybody else who notices the elephant in the room.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.400
I don't really care though.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.680
If an idiot thinks that I'm a racist, why should I take his opinion seriously?

08:12.680 --> 08:13.680
He's an idiot.

08:13.680 --> 08:16.920
I'm not a reactionary for thinking that 90s cartoons handled racism way better than

08:16.920 --> 08:19.200
the liquid shit being sprayed onto TV today.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.640
I mean, just compare these two clips real quick.

08:21.640 --> 08:24.000
Hey Dad, this is my friend Virgil.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.640
Remember, I told you about him.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.480
Not nearly enough.

08:29.480 --> 08:32.000
And now I see why Richie acts like a hoot, Maggie.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.880
That kid's a bad influence.

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
All his kind are.

08:34.880 --> 08:36.440
Keep your voice down.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.520
It's bad enough I gotta deal with them all day long.

08:38.520 --> 08:41.200
Now one of them's in my house.

08:41.200 --> 08:47.280
You're still early.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.240
I can go home without calling my pops for a ride.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.240
Virgil, don't leave.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.240
Please.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.840
I talked to my mom.

08:52.840 --> 08:53.840
What good is that going to do, Rich?

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
She can't change what he said.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.840
You were right all along.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
Hanging here was a bad idea.

08:56.840 --> 08:57.840
Sorry.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.840
Black people can't marry white people.

08:58.840 --> 08:59.840
Hey now.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.840
It's Garnet from Steven Universe.

09:00.840 --> 09:01.840
Kids, don't be racist.

09:01.840 --> 09:14.440
But when it comes to real life representation and not just media representation, there's

09:14.440 --> 09:16.720
the added issue of replacism to consider.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.160
I don't strictly mean that great replacement stuff, though it certainly falls under this

09:20.160 --> 09:21.160
umbrella.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.280
We're talking about voting populations in a country getting replaced with immigrants

09:24.280 --> 09:28.240
because the native population refuses to rubber stamp government initiatives, something that

09:28.240 --> 09:30.240
the left openly likes to celebrate.

09:30.240 --> 09:34.280
It's just proof that to the ruling class, the electorate is fungible and should be switched

09:34.280 --> 09:36.200
out until they get with the program.

09:36.200 --> 09:41.600
White British population has decreased by 600,000, while the minority population has

09:41.600 --> 09:44.120
increased by 1.2 million.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.600
So yes lads, we're winning.

09:45.600 --> 09:49.640
Remember the whole Bridget thing recently, where solely for political points people online

09:49.640 --> 09:53.400
really wanted Guilty Gear's Bridget to be trans and it erupted into a big fight with

09:53.400 --> 09:56.800
a few people going mask off and saying that they don't actually care about the integrity

09:56.800 --> 10:00.620
of the lore or the story or the characters of Guilty Gear, they just want the good righteous

10:00.620 --> 10:04.520
trans community to get wins over the evil transphobic femme boys?

10:04.520 --> 10:08.640
These people are desperate to invalidate cis men's expressions of femininity.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.480
They want every feminine guy character to be trans, especially if they're famous,

10:12.480 --> 10:15.560
because that means representation and validation in political power.

10:15.560 --> 10:19.440
And when this attitude crosses over from something silly like representation and Guilty Gear into

10:19.440 --> 10:24.320
the real world, you start to have some very toxic behaviors, like where trans activists

10:24.320 --> 10:29.480
bully feminine gay men into coming out as trans women because their existence as feminine

10:29.480 --> 10:32.480
gay men is offensive towards the trans experience.

10:32.480 --> 10:39.240
Putting aside the obviously abusive and destructive component of this behavior, this is also replacism.

10:39.240 --> 10:42.960
If feminine gay men, femme boys, traps, whatever you want to call them, if their existence

10:42.960 --> 10:46.880
is offensive towards trans people, and if you can force all of them to be trans, then

10:46.880 --> 10:51.060
the source of the offense has been replaced with something that is positive to their movement.

10:51.060 --> 10:55.000
All those articles from earlier talking about jobs wanting only minorities and how industries

10:55.000 --> 10:57.120
need to have more diverse representation?

10:57.120 --> 11:00.760
Well there's only so many jobs or university spots or whatever, at least in the short term,

11:00.760 --> 11:03.360
it takes time to increase the capacity of those things.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.520
For example, that one article talking about how farming in Britain needs to be diversified?

11:07.520 --> 11:12.080
Well there's only so much land in the UK, how do you propose to make farming more diverse?

11:12.080 --> 11:16.760
The only possible answer is to replace the current farmers with more diverse ones.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.640
In this way, diversity is replacism.

11:19.640 --> 11:23.760
As long as the total number of spots within any domain is fixed, you will always have

11:23.760 --> 11:26.300
to remove the old to make space for the new.

11:26.300 --> 11:31.080
And if you can expand the system, if you can add new slots, you will always be disqualifying

11:31.080 --> 11:35.160
appropriate candidates based on their mutable characteristics in the name of diversity.

11:35.160 --> 11:39.320
In order to represent group A in position 1, you necessarily cannot represent group

11:39.320 --> 11:41.740
B in position 1, there's no two ways about it.

11:41.740 --> 11:46.480
That being said, with today's if I identify as it, I am it attitude, it's not hard to

11:46.480 --> 11:48.420
fudge the rules to your own advantage.

11:48.420 --> 11:52.120
For example, in Canada's far left political party, the NDP, there's a standing rule

11:52.120 --> 11:56.280
that any departing NDP candidate needs to be replaced with a minority, for the good

11:56.280 --> 11:59.600
of diversity and inclusion, representation and equality and all of it.

11:59.600 --> 12:04.240
Jerry Taft, a white man, beat out Spring Hawes for a nomination, and Hawes, a disabled woman,

12:04.240 --> 12:07.400
put the party on blast for choosing a white man over her.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.220
Taft simply said publicly, I'm bisexual and everybody shut up.

12:11.220 --> 12:14.860
So if you happen to be a white guy in a committed relationship with a woman, and you've got

12:14.860 --> 12:18.780
some diversity related problems, just claim that you got drunk and sucked a dick back

12:18.780 --> 12:20.760
in college, and you'll be right as rain.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.180
This whole thing is fully retarded by the way.

12:23.180 --> 12:25.320
Representation and diversity and all the rest of it.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.060
Representation went from modeling for an underclass of people what it looks like when they actually

12:29.060 --> 12:32.860
made something of themselves, in a time where they desperately needed role models and had

12:32.860 --> 12:33.860
nowhere to turn.

12:33.860 --> 12:37.460
To a farce where everybody scrambles for the most oppression points in order to get a job

12:37.460 --> 12:42.140
or a spot in a program that they're woefully unqualified for because hiring based on merit

12:42.140 --> 12:44.060
is now considered a bigoted act.

12:44.160 --> 12:48.540
First of all, this change has actually harmed the very classes of people it was meant to

12:48.540 --> 12:49.540
help.

12:49.540 --> 12:52.320
For example, the data on diversity quotas in schools is in.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.020
When a university implements a rule where black people who are otherwise unqualified

12:56.020 --> 12:59.300
are let in anyway, it's true that black enrollment goes up.

12:59.300 --> 13:03.740
But black dropouts also go up because the people they let in can't learn or compete

13:03.740 --> 13:05.180
effectively at that level.

13:05.180 --> 13:08.500
Instead of going into a school or a program that they could actually succeed in, they

13:08.500 --> 13:13.020
become dropouts saddled with debt, reinforcing negative stereotypes about black youth.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.380
This is a concept called academic mismatch.

13:15.380 --> 13:19.740
And although the data has been rock solid on it for a decade now, people are still forging

13:19.740 --> 13:23.960
ahead with policies intended to help minorities that only make the problem worse.

13:23.960 --> 13:27.160
And they do it because they are ideologically blinded.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.140
There was once a very good reason to push for representation.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.300
There was a real issue there.

13:31.300 --> 13:35.980
And in some select domains, for some specific types of people, it still may be an issue.

13:35.980 --> 13:37.520
But this isn't the 1950s.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.620
Nobody's out there anymore saying that women can't earn their own money, or disabled

13:40.620 --> 13:44.820
people can't contribute to society, or gay people have to be weird, pedo, age-spreading

13:44.820 --> 13:47.260
degenerates, or black people are too dumb for school.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.660
Nowadays people can do whatever they want.

13:48.660 --> 13:49.660
Hey, wait a minute.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.220
There are people saying all that shit.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.220
It's the left.

13:52.220 --> 13:53.740
They think disabled people can't contribute.

13:53.740 --> 13:56.900
It's why they want them to be paid for, for life, rather than letting disabled people

13:56.900 --> 14:00.200
contribute in their own way and have some dignity by standing on their own two feet.

14:00.200 --> 14:05.140
They think LGBT people are weird degenerates and that being a weird degenerate is a core

14:05.140 --> 14:06.600
component of being queer.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.540
And if you're gay or trans, but you're not a weird degenerate, then you're a traitor

14:09.540 --> 14:10.540
to the cause.

14:10.580 --> 14:13.160
They think that black people are too dumb for school.

14:13.160 --> 14:15.020
That's why they've implemented diversity quotas.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.440
This is what representation is in the modern era.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.740
It's just bigotry.

14:18.740 --> 14:21.140
It's kind of like Sargon said all those years ago.

14:21.140 --> 14:24.220
I'm in favor of making things more equal.

14:24.220 --> 14:25.220
Okay, but I'm not.

14:25.220 --> 14:27.060
I'm making things more free.

14:27.060 --> 14:29.220
And freedom naturally will cause inequality.

14:29.220 --> 14:31.200
Freedom entails discrimination.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.020
Freedom allows white men to control everything.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.920
Oh my God, you're a white supremacist.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.000
You are actually a white supremacist with a guilty conscience on us.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Jesus Christ.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.880
Honestly, this is, this is like...
