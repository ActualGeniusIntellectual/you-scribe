0	9580	To some people, representation in media or entertainment is important, and I understand
9580	10580	why.
10580	13080	If you're a black kid growing up in the 50s, watching a bunch of TV shows with only
13080	16900	white people in them, it's reasonable to feel a bit alienated from your own culture.
16900	21180	In that era, television presented stereotypically normal families, and those families were all
21180	23660	entirely white, straight, and functional.
23660	27060	Unlike a progressive might say, I'm not saying this is a bad thing.
27060	31140	It's good when a society models what a functional family unit looks like in its storytelling.
31140	34540	But black families weren't modeled in that way in that era.
34540	39640	As a general rule, black people in this era's stories were servants or comedic relief characters,
39640	43120	not really treated poorly by the white cast, but also not on equal footing.
43120	44420	They were the happy servant.
44420	48200	Again, unlike a progressive, I'm not going to focus too heavily on the moral component
48200	49580	of changing the state of affairs.
49580	54000	There certainly was one, but the capitalist component was arguably a more central force.
54000	57480	The black desire to see themselves represented in a positive light within the media they
57480	59680	consume was a gap in the market.
59680	63520	There was money to be made there, and I would argue that that money drove a lot of the change.
63520	67440	The first TV show to truly show a black person in an equal, well-respected role was Star
67440	72280	Trek in 1967 with Lt. Uhura, and it's a well-known story by now that when the recently departed
72280	76220	Nichelle Nichols wanted to leave Star Trek, Martin Luther King Jr. talked her out of it,
76220	79680	saying to her that, for the first time on television, we will be seen as we should be
79680	84440	seen every day, as intelligent, quality, beautiful people who can sing, dance, and
84440	86800	go to space, who are professors, lawyers.
86800	91760	Uhura, in her position as communications officer of the USS Enterprise, was treated as a competent,
91760	93960	respected equal by the other members of the ship.
93960	97560	This had never been done before with a black character in 1967.
97560	100860	One of the downstream effects of Uhura's positive black representation was that the
100860	104320	70s and 80s saw the creation of the black sitcom, where black families could also be
104320	107080	modeled as functional and loving like white families had been.
107080	110680	Stanford and Son, The Jeffersons, and The Cosby Show are all ones that I remember watching
110680	114080	reruns of as a kid in the 90s, though I will say that mentioning that last one is a little
114080	115340	bit weird nowadays.
115340	118760	One of the most successful sitcoms of all time was a black sitcom, The Fresh Prince
118760	119760	of Bel-Air.
119760	122960	The point I'm getting at is, the left is correct when they say that representation
122960	125240	matters, at least up to a point.
125240	127880	Sometimes as a kid, you need somebody else to model what it's like to be a successful
127880	131600	version of yourself, especially if the adults in your life aren't doing it.
131600	135500	However, keep in mind that I'm talking about a period of time ranging from 40 to 70 years
135500	136720	ago at this point.
136760	141120	This is not a problem that we have anymore, at least for black people, and yet, the representation
141120	142680	machine marches on.
142680	146000	Consider the shit show surrounding Moses Ingram in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show.
146000	149620	It's important to us that when we turn on the TV, we see the world that we live in reflected
149620	150620	back to us.
150620	153380	Obi-Wan Kenobi is the most diverse Star Wars project.
153380	156560	If you've got talking droids and aliens, but no people of color, it doesn't make
156560	157560	any sense.
157560	161000	She's talking like it's still the 60s, but a lot of these issues have been solved.
161000	164200	I don't care that Reva was written to be a black woman, she's a new character, that's
164200	165200	fine.
165200	166200	Write what you want to write.
166200	169240	She knows that the character isn't very good, but people call you a racist for saying
169240	170240	that.
170240	173580	However, when you start to change the story for the sake of representation, especially
173580	178120	for a problem solved before I was even born, it starts to appear ideological.
178120	182920	Like for example, casting a black man in Netflix's Resident Evil series to play Wesker, who was
182920	187120	specifically made white and blonde by the Japanese game developers to give him a bit
187120	188460	of an Aryan feel.
188460	192060	Or how in the new Magic the Gathering set featuring Lord of the Rings characters, they
192060	196580	made Aragorn black, even though black people come from a specific foreign kingdom in Lord
196580	199160	of the Rings and would not be the kings of Gondor.
199160	203740	Or how in the House of the Dragon, Corus Velaryon is played by a black man, simply because in
203740	208860	the lore, the sea snake is described as being tan-skinned in comparison to the pale skin
208860	213260	of your average Westerosi, with some pictures singling him out as slightly darker than his
213260	214260	peers.
214260	217140	And they really wanted to stretch that description out to hit the diversity quota.
217140	221860	In fact, Lord Corlys' daughter, Daella, is described as screaming in fright upon seeing
221860	225340	a black man for the first time, a prince from the Summer Isles, mistaking him for a
225340	226980	demon because of his skin color.
226980	230720	Now why in the hell would this girl scream upon seeing a black man?
230720	235060	The issue most people have with representation isn't that they just hate minorities, but
235060	238740	rather that one, creators nowadays seem to be willing to harm the integrity of their
238740	241460	own world-building in the service of representation.
241460	245880	And two, there's at least some correlation between creators willing to shoehorn in representation
245880	247580	and creators making low-quality work.
247580	249200	Here's an example of what I mean.
249200	250200	Last of Us 2 sucks.
250240	252500	No, I don't care what you have to say, Econoboi, it sucks.
252500	256640	In the game, you can find a trans flag hanging in an apartment, pride flags on lamp posts,
256640	257840	and a pride crosswalk.
257840	261340	This is a post-apocalyptic game, so yeah, it makes sense that these things would just
261340	262400	be left over.
262400	263400	Except it doesn't.
263400	266960	In the timeline of the series, the zombie apocalypse began in late September, early
266960	269040	October of 2013.
269040	272380	That's why, for example, you can often find Halloween stuff around the game.
272380	275920	There wouldn't be Pride Month stuff in October when Pride Month is June.
275920	280040	Moreover, back in 2013, Pride was still largely relegated to parades.
280040	284540	It wasn't yet common to see pride crosswalks or pride flags lining streets by the dozens
284540	285640	for a full month.
285640	288620	And the trans flag wasn't common either, even at Pride events.
288620	292200	When I was playing Last of Us 2, this stuff took me out of the experience.
292200	295760	Not because I'm a homophobe or a transphobe, but because I recognized pretty quickly that
295760	297380	this stuff wouldn't really be there.
297380	300300	It was placed there by the game dev as a way to virtue signal.
300300	303140	Last of Us 2 sucked for a lot of reasons unrelated to the flags.
303140	307460	The flags didn't make the game suck, but the flags informed us that it probably would.
307460	310540	At some point, this sort of representation just becomes a joke.
310540	313380	Like they're mocking us for having to put up with this shit, and mocking the very people
313380	316940	they represent for using them as pawns to make themselves look better and sell more
316940	317940	product.
317940	322300	Disney's string of first openly gay characters has gone on for so long it's a fucking joke
322300	323300	nowadays.
323300	327260	It's not progressive if all you're doing is progressing to the spot that liberals reached
327260	331280	20 years ago, and you're doing it so tepidly that it can be easily edited out for the Middle
331280	332940	East and Chinese releases.
332940	337220	The counterpart to media representation is IRL representation, and at this point this
337220	339740	stuff becomes a lot more insidious.
339740	343740	Pick any field at all, and you'll find some prog somewhere crying about how it needs to
343740	347420	be diversified, how there's too many straight white men involved, how their voices are heard
347420	350940	too often, and how minorities need to be placed at the forefront of these domains.
350940	354260	It doesn't matter that people in these positions got there meritocratically if the hiring process
354260	358900	or whatever was colorblind, because not seeing race and hard work and punctuality are all
358900	360260	tools of whiteness.
360260	364140	And demanding minorities adhere to those standards is a colonizer mindset.
364140	369340	This attitude is best described by Audre Lorde, a black radical intersectional socialist activist.
369340	371940	For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.
371940	375400	They may allow us to temporarily beat him at his own game, but they will never enable
375400	377260	us to bring about genuine change.
377260	380860	Racism and homophobia are real conditions of all of our lives in this place and time.
380860	385100	I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself
385100	388220	and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there.
388220	390060	See whose face it wears.
390060	394260	Again, the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all of our choices.
394260	397340	Everything I've been talking about on this channel in the past few months, it's all here
397340	398340	in this quote.
398340	402060	That totalitarian, everything is political view where there is no conception of a private
402060	403060	life.
403060	406180	Subversion of institutions with the purpose of dismantling them and building a revolution.
406180	410740	Pinning any sort of doubt or deviation from the struggle as internalized racism, homophobia
410740	411800	or misogyny.
411800	415820	This is the reason why progressives are so happy to be racist, sexist, homophobic or
415820	419260	transphobic to minority individuals who don't follow their politics.
419260	424580	Being black or gay or trans requires an ideological commitment, not simply being the thing.
424580	428200	In other words, you're not really gay if you don't engage in the most degenerate fucking
428200	429200	garbage imaginable.
429200	433380	You're not really trans if you're not also a socialist sex worker who spends every waking
433380	434900	moment subverting the gender binary.
434900	439080	You're not really black if you act white by graduating school, getting married before
439080	441820	having kids, or building a stable home and family life.
441820	443260	It's all bullshit of course.
443260	447080	It's worshipping dysfunction because the dominant culture is largely a functional one
447080	451120	and they want to remain the counterculture even if it destroys the very people they claim
451120	452380	to advocate for.
452380	456400	At this point, we've completely flipped around 180 on what the purpose of representation
456400	457400	was.
457400	460420	When it was Star Trek and the Jeffersons and Fresh Prince, it was meant to show that even
460420	462480	though you're different, you can make it too.
462480	466100	You're not doomed to a life of dysfunction and depression simply because of your difference.
466100	469880	But nowadays, representation seems to worship that dysfunction and depression, making it
469880	474400	more integral to the minority experience than actually being a minority to the point that
474400	479460	successful minorities are Uncle Toms, counter-revolutionaries, collaborators, traitors, and of course for
479460	484040	pointing this out, I'm already a racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, fascist,
484040	485880	reactionary, blah blah blah blah blah.
485880	488240	So is anybody else who notices the elephant in the room.
488240	489400	I don't really care though.
489400	492680	If an idiot thinks that I'm a racist, why should I take his opinion seriously?
492680	493680	He's an idiot.
493680	496920	I'm not a reactionary for thinking that 90s cartoons handled racism way better than
496920	499200	the liquid shit being sprayed onto TV today.
499200	501640	I mean, just compare these two clips real quick.
501640	504000	Hey Dad, this is my friend Virgil.
504000	506640	Remember, I told you about him.
506640	509480	Not nearly enough.
509480	512000	And now I see why Richie acts like a hoot, Maggie.
512000	513880	That kid's a bad influence.
513880	514880	All his kind are.
514880	516440	Keep your voice down.
516440	518520	It's bad enough I gotta deal with them all day long.
518520	521200	Now one of them's in my house.
521200	527280	You're still early.
527280	529240	I can go home without calling my pops for a ride.
529240	530240	Virgil, don't leave.
530240	531240	Please.
531840	532840	I talked to my mom.
532840	533840	What good is that going to do, Rich?
533840	534840	She can't change what he said.
534840	535840	You were right all along.
535840	536840	Hanging here was a bad idea.
536840	537840	Sorry.
537840	538840	Black people can't marry white people.
538840	539840	Hey now.
539840	540840	It's Garnet from Steven Universe.
540840	541840	Kids, don't be racist.
541840	554440	But when it comes to real life representation and not just media representation, there's
554440	556720	the added issue of replacism to consider.
556720	560160	I don't strictly mean that great replacement stuff, though it certainly falls under this
560160	561160	umbrella.
562080	564280	We're talking about voting populations in a country getting replaced with immigrants
564280	568240	because the native population refuses to rubber stamp government initiatives, something that
568240	570240	the left openly likes to celebrate.
570240	574280	It's just proof that to the ruling class, the electorate is fungible and should be switched
574280	576200	out until they get with the program.
576200	581600	White British population has decreased by 600,000, while the minority population has
581600	584120	increased by 1.2 million.
584120	585600	So yes lads, we're winning.
585600	589640	Remember the whole Bridget thing recently, where solely for political points people online
589640	593400	really wanted Guilty Gear's Bridget to be trans and it erupted into a big fight with
593400	596800	a few people going mask off and saying that they don't actually care about the integrity
596800	600620	of the lore or the story or the characters of Guilty Gear, they just want the good righteous
600620	604520	trans community to get wins over the evil transphobic femme boys?
604520	608640	These people are desperate to invalidate cis men's expressions of femininity.
608640	612480	They want every feminine guy character to be trans, especially if they're famous,
612480	615560	because that means representation and validation in political power.
615560	619440	And when this attitude crosses over from something silly like representation and Guilty Gear into
619440	624320	the real world, you start to have some very toxic behaviors, like where trans activists
624320	629480	bully feminine gay men into coming out as trans women because their existence as feminine
629480	632480	gay men is offensive towards the trans experience.
632480	639240	Putting aside the obviously abusive and destructive component of this behavior, this is also replacism.
639240	642960	If feminine gay men, femme boys, traps, whatever you want to call them, if their existence
642960	646880	is offensive towards trans people, and if you can force all of them to be trans, then
646880	651060	the source of the offense has been replaced with something that is positive to their movement.
651060	655000	All those articles from earlier talking about jobs wanting only minorities and how industries
655000	657120	need to have more diverse representation?
657120	660760	Well there's only so many jobs or university spots or whatever, at least in the short term,
660760	663360	it takes time to increase the capacity of those things.
663360	667520	For example, that one article talking about how farming in Britain needs to be diversified?
667520	672080	Well there's only so much land in the UK, how do you propose to make farming more diverse?
672080	676760	The only possible answer is to replace the current farmers with more diverse ones.
676760	679640	In this way, diversity is replacism.
679640	683760	As long as the total number of spots within any domain is fixed, you will always have
683760	686300	to remove the old to make space for the new.
686300	691080	And if you can expand the system, if you can add new slots, you will always be disqualifying
691080	695160	appropriate candidates based on their mutable characteristics in the name of diversity.
695160	699320	In order to represent group A in position 1, you necessarily cannot represent group
699320	701740	B in position 1, there's no two ways about it.
701740	706480	That being said, with today's if I identify as it, I am it attitude, it's not hard to
706480	708420	fudge the rules to your own advantage.
708420	712120	For example, in Canada's far left political party, the NDP, there's a standing rule
712120	716280	that any departing NDP candidate needs to be replaced with a minority, for the good
716280	719600	of diversity and inclusion, representation and equality and all of it.
719600	724240	Jerry Taft, a white man, beat out Spring Hawes for a nomination, and Hawes, a disabled woman,
724240	727400	put the party on blast for choosing a white man over her.
727400	731220	Taft simply said publicly, I'm bisexual and everybody shut up.
731220	734860	So if you happen to be a white guy in a committed relationship with a woman, and you've got
734860	738780	some diversity related problems, just claim that you got drunk and sucked a dick back
738780	740760	in college, and you'll be right as rain.
740760	743180	This whole thing is fully retarded by the way.
743180	745320	Representation and diversity and all the rest of it.
745320	749060	Representation went from modeling for an underclass of people what it looks like when they actually
749060	752860	made something of themselves, in a time where they desperately needed role models and had
752860	753860	nowhere to turn.
753860	757460	To a farce where everybody scrambles for the most oppression points in order to get a job
757460	762140	or a spot in a program that they're woefully unqualified for because hiring based on merit
762140	764060	is now considered a bigoted act.
764160	768540	First of all, this change has actually harmed the very classes of people it was meant to
768540	769540	help.
769540	772320	For example, the data on diversity quotas in schools is in.
772320	776020	When a university implements a rule where black people who are otherwise unqualified
776020	779300	are let in anyway, it's true that black enrollment goes up.
779300	783740	But black dropouts also go up because the people they let in can't learn or compete
783740	785180	effectively at that level.
785180	788500	Instead of going into a school or a program that they could actually succeed in, they
788500	793020	become dropouts saddled with debt, reinforcing negative stereotypes about black youth.
793020	795380	This is a concept called academic mismatch.
795380	799740	And although the data has been rock solid on it for a decade now, people are still forging
799740	803960	ahead with policies intended to help minorities that only make the problem worse.
803960	807160	And they do it because they are ideologically blinded.
807160	810140	There was once a very good reason to push for representation.
810140	811300	There was a real issue there.
811300	815980	And in some select domains, for some specific types of people, it still may be an issue.
815980	817520	But this isn't the 1950s.
817520	820620	Nobody's out there anymore saying that women can't earn their own money, or disabled
820620	824820	people can't contribute to society, or gay people have to be weird, pedo, age-spreading
824820	827260	degenerates, or black people are too dumb for school.
827260	828660	Nowadays people can do whatever they want.
828660	829660	Hey, wait a minute.
829660	831220	There are people saying all that shit.
831220	832220	It's the left.
832220	833740	They think disabled people can't contribute.
833740	836900	It's why they want them to be paid for, for life, rather than letting disabled people
836900	840200	contribute in their own way and have some dignity by standing on their own two feet.
840200	845140	They think LGBT people are weird degenerates and that being a weird degenerate is a core
845140	846600	component of being queer.
846600	849540	And if you're gay or trans, but you're not a weird degenerate, then you're a traitor
849540	850540	to the cause.
850580	853160	They think that black people are too dumb for school.
853160	855020	That's why they've implemented diversity quotas.
855020	857440	This is what representation is in the modern era.
857440	858740	It's just bigotry.
858740	861140	It's kind of like Sargon said all those years ago.
861140	864220	I'm in favor of making things more equal.
864220	865220	Okay, but I'm not.
865220	867060	I'm making things more free.
867060	869220	And freedom naturally will cause inequality.
869220	871200	Freedom entails discrimination.
871200	874020	Freedom allows white men to control everything.
874020	877920	Oh my God, you're a white supremacist.
877920	882000	You are actually a white supremacist with a guilty conscience on us.
882000	884000	Jesus Christ.
884000	885880	Honestly, this is, this is like...
