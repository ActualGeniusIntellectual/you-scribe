00:00.000 --> 00:08.140
Sometimes, Twitter will drop a beautiful thing into your lap.

00:08.140 --> 00:12.680
A person who is so out of left field, so wrong, he doesn't know how wrong he is.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.480
Okay, that's pretty much everybody on Twitter.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.480
All the time.

00:15.480 --> 00:20.200
But today I'm talking about this thread by Sokden Left, everybody's favorite Dunning-Kruger

00:20.200 --> 00:21.660
socialist femboy.

00:21.660 --> 00:25.320
This isn't exactly how I wanted to start my morning, but I've got my coffee ready,

00:25.320 --> 00:35.060
and now is about as good a time as any.

00:35.060 --> 00:39.940
That capturing the culture quote from Gramsci is fake, or why the conservative intellectual

00:39.940 --> 00:41.280
ecosystem is broken.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.760
If you're a lefty, you've seen this Gramsci quote.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.040
In the new order, socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration

00:48.040 --> 00:52.400
of schools, universities, churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of

00:52.400 --> 00:53.400
society.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
It's fake.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.000
You'll find this quote in Gramsci's writings.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.160
It's a bad summary of Gramsci from Wardner 1996, Unholy Alliance, an insane screed about

01:02.160 --> 01:04.120
how Freemasons control the world.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.120
Why does this matter?

01:05.120 --> 01:07.880
First, the conservative intellectual ecosystem is broken.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.400
I counted over 50 uses of this fake quote in major conservative publications by prominent

01:13.400 --> 01:14.400
conservatives.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.060
Not one fact-checked it.

01:16.060 --> 01:19.600
Billionaire backers means that rightists don't need to care about truth.

01:19.600 --> 01:23.660
Rightists claim that leftists seize control of the institutions, and use that to justify

01:23.660 --> 01:25.100
seizing control back.

01:25.100 --> 01:30.480
In short, rightist pundits use a fake Gramsci quote created by an anti-Freemason conspiracist

01:30.480 --> 01:35.060
to justify the existence of a secret communist conspiracy, which they use to justify destroying

01:35.060 --> 01:37.420
claimed leftist institutions.

01:37.420 --> 01:40.860
In shorter, the conservative intellectual ecosystem is broken.

01:40.860 --> 01:43.420
Rightist grifters don't have to care about the truth.

01:43.420 --> 01:48.540
Now, just so I'm not accused of being bad faith, Sock Dunn Left did go into detail on

01:48.540 --> 01:51.440
a substack, which you can check out for yourself if you like.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.040
But having read the whole article myself, I can confirm that the Twitter thread is a

01:55.040 --> 01:56.400
pretty accurate summary of it.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.760
I can additionally confirm that the information in the article is also mostly accurate, but

02:00.760 --> 02:05.080
also that Sock Dunn Left misses the point, and it's actually very easy to see where

02:05.080 --> 02:06.560
he goes off the rails.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.120
But let's first start by giving credit where credit is due.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.800
He's entirely correct when he says this quotation that conservatives tend to attribute to Gramsci

02:13.800 --> 02:15.120
is mostly false.

02:15.120 --> 02:19.640
Of these words, socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.960
In the New Order, socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration

02:23.960 --> 02:27.760
of schools, universities, churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of

02:27.760 --> 02:28.760
society.

02:28.760 --> 02:33.400
Only that first line, socialism is the religion that must overwhelm Christianity, were actually

02:33.400 --> 02:34.740
Gramsci's own words.

02:34.740 --> 02:39.400
That passage comes from an article Gramsci wrote in the Italian socialist newspaper Avanti

02:39.400 --> 02:44.120
in 1916, titled Odissia e Fede, or Audacity and Faith.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.320
Listen, just because my dad's side of the family comes from Italy doesn't mean that

02:47.320 --> 02:49.040
I know how to pronounce any of this shit.

02:49.040 --> 02:53.420
The context is, Gramsci is publicly responding to the claims of a Christian socialist from

02:53.420 --> 02:57.380
a different socialist publication, who thinks that socialism should become Christian.

02:57.380 --> 03:01.500
Christian socialists believe that capitalism is rooted in the sin of greed, and that Jesus,

03:01.500 --> 03:05.600
who lowered himself to the level of the destitute and fed the poor, was a socialist himself.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.360
They also believe that the shared insular economies of monasteries were an ideal socialist

03:10.360 --> 03:12.780
model for the collectivization of private property.

03:12.780 --> 03:17.300
The idea that all humans, despite their earthly differences, are equal under God is an idea

03:17.300 --> 03:19.260
well adapted to socialism.

03:19.260 --> 03:22.060
Gramsci's response to the Christian socialist was this.

03:22.060 --> 03:25.140
Socialism is precisely the religion that must kill Christianity.

03:25.140 --> 03:29.340
Religion in the sense that it is also a faith, which has its mystics and practices.

03:29.340 --> 03:33.180
Religion because it has replaced in the consciences to the transcendental God of Catholics.

03:33.180 --> 03:36.700
Trust in man and in his best energies as the only spiritual reality.

03:36.700 --> 03:41.140
Our gospel is modern philosophy, the one that does without the hypothesis of God in the

03:41.140 --> 03:42.260
vision of the universe.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.700
What only in history lays its foundations.

03:44.700 --> 03:53.060
In other words, socialism must kill Christianity because socialism fulfills a similar function.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.860
As a secular religion, it doesn't deal with the divine, but it does provide an ethical

03:56.860 --> 04:00.060
system and a blueprint of the universe, which are at odds with the Christian one.

04:00.060 --> 04:04.960
For Gramsci, Marx's historical materialist analytical method is how we determine what

04:04.960 --> 04:07.440
we should do next, rather than God's law.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.940
The rest of that incorrect quotation, in the new order socialism will triumph by first

04:11.940 --> 04:16.140
capturing the culture via infiltration of schools, universities, churches, and the media

04:16.140 --> 04:20.860
by transforming the consciousness of society, was never spoken or written by Gramsci.

04:20.860 --> 04:25.500
Sock Dun Left claims that this quote first comes from a 1996 book, Unholy Alliances,

04:25.500 --> 04:29.500
The Secret Plan and the Secret People Working to Destroy America, by James Wardner.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.020
This book, which I admit I haven't read, seems to contain a lot of stuff about the

04:33.020 --> 04:36.780
Freemasons secretly controlling the world from the shadows, and how all elections are

04:36.780 --> 04:40.380
rigged, and how the Catholic Church has been infiltrated, and all that sort of stuff.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.200
Wardner doesn't seem to think that the Jews are behind the new world order, though,

04:43.200 --> 04:44.200
which is a bit surprising.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.340
That's the one conspiracy theory he hasn't bought into.

04:46.340 --> 04:51.580
The rest of the quote comes from Wardner paraphrasing Gramsci, and not actually Gramsci's own words.

04:51.580 --> 04:54.280
This happens quite a lot in the internet quoting business, to be honest.

04:54.280 --> 04:58.580
The famous socialist quote, The last capitalist shall sell us the rope we hang him with, is

04:58.580 --> 05:03.200
attributed online to the writing of both Marx and Stalin, but actually comes from a private

05:03.200 --> 05:08.280
note written by Lenin on a scrap of paper, later repeated by Yuri Anenkov, a Russian artist,

05:08.280 --> 05:09.460
who claimed to have seen it.

05:09.540 --> 05:14.260
Wardner wrote two books on this topic, Unholy Alliances and a second one, The Planned Destruction

05:14.260 --> 05:17.940
of America, which seems to be more of the same, Communists and Freemasons.

05:17.940 --> 05:21.420
There's videos of him talking about this stuff from back in the 90s.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.980
Wardner died in 2016, and would you believe it, he was a Florida man.

05:24.980 --> 05:29.220
In other words, Wardner is rather inconsequential to the story, all things considered.

05:29.220 --> 05:33.540
But this quote, commonly attributed to Gramsci, for the most part, did come from this obscure

05:33.540 --> 05:38.700
Freemason book where the author, whose ideas are more than a little dubious, gave his interpretation

05:38.700 --> 05:40.120
of Gramsci's views.

05:40.120 --> 05:45.140
The question then is, despite Wardner's eccentricities, is this summary of Gramsci's

05:45.140 --> 05:46.140
view accurate?

05:46.140 --> 05:48.220
What did Gramsci himself actually believe?

05:53.500 --> 05:57.060
Antonio Gramsci was born on the island of Sardinia in the Kingdom of Italy.

05:57.060 --> 06:00.860
He suffered from health problems all his life, due to what modern medicine now believes was

06:00.860 --> 06:04.780
pot disease, which is a form of tuberculosis that can deform the spine.

06:04.860 --> 06:09.100
Gramsci was an uber manlet due to the disease, less than five feet tall as an adult.

06:09.100 --> 06:13.120
But he was intellectually gifted, and he won a scholarship to the University of Turin in

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
Northern Italy.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.460
In his early years, Gramsci was a proponent of Sardinian nationalism, believing Sardinia's

06:18.460 --> 06:21.980
poverty and mistreatment to be the fault of the central Italian government, which was

06:21.980 --> 06:25.280
focusing its attention on the rapidly industrializing north.

06:25.280 --> 06:29.240
But after attending university, he began to believe that socialism and not nationalism

06:29.240 --> 06:32.620
would ultimately solve the problems of the Sardinian working class.

06:32.620 --> 06:36.880
While at the University of Turin, Gramsci was influenced by a wide spectrum of ideas.

06:36.880 --> 06:40.620
From Benedetto Crose, who at the time was one of Italy's most well-respected liberal

06:40.620 --> 06:44.940
thinkers, to Giovanni Gentile, who is most notable for becoming the most prolific philosopher

06:44.940 --> 06:46.140
of fascism.

06:46.140 --> 06:51.460
From 1917, socialist rioting in Turin had led to the arrest of many notable socialists.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.940
This left holes in Turin's socialist scene, which Antonio Gramsci's fierce intellect

06:55.940 --> 06:57.060
allowed him to fill.

06:57.060 --> 07:00.020
He was elected to the Socialist Party's provisional committee, and eventually set

07:00.020 --> 07:01.980
up the newspaper that attracted Lenin's attention.

07:02.340 --> 07:08.980
In English, Lenin viewed Gramsci's group as being the closest faction in the Italian

07:08.980 --> 07:12.820
socialist community that was equivalent to the Bolsheviks of Russia, and granted him

07:12.820 --> 07:14.940
his support at the Third International.

07:14.940 --> 07:18.420
This was due to Gramsci's support of the Italian workers' councils, which had appeared

07:18.420 --> 07:22.340
spontaneously during the general strike of 1919.

07:22.340 --> 07:26.380
Organizations that Gramsci had conceptualized as being like the Soviets in Russia.

07:26.380 --> 07:30.020
These councils are actually quite important in the development of Gramsci's ideas, so

07:30.020 --> 07:31.360
let's talk about them for a bit.

07:31.740 --> 07:35.800
This era of Italian history is known as the Bienno Rosso, or in English, the Two Red Years,

07:35.800 --> 07:41.220
a period of significant economic and social instability lasting from 1919 to 1920.

07:41.220 --> 07:45.760
As I mentioned in my video, The Three Forms of Fascism, Italy incurred great economic

07:45.760 --> 07:47.760
costs to mobilize for World War I.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.700
And at the end of the war, when all those soldiers returned home, they discovered that

07:50.700 --> 07:55.080
with their addition to the workforce, there were too many workers and not enough work.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.160
High unemployment and high inflation led to a significant increase in the price of basic

07:59.160 --> 08:00.160
goods.

08:00.160 --> 08:04.120
Large swathes of Italian society ended up joining various revolutionary groups during

08:04.120 --> 08:07.960
this period, from the Italian Socialist Party, which Gramsci was a member of, to the Italian

08:07.960 --> 08:12.000
Syndicalist Union, which advocated for Italy's entry into the war in the first place, to

08:12.000 --> 08:15.600
the Italian Fighting League, which was the precursor to Mussolini's black shirts.

08:15.600 --> 08:20.680
This period saw widespread striking among both city laborers and rural peasants, street

08:20.680 --> 08:25.420
violence, and eventually workers seizing factories with force after their owners tried to lock

08:25.420 --> 08:26.420
them out.

08:26.420 --> 08:30.900
These workers created the Italian worker councils that Gramsci viewed as being the equivalent

08:30.900 --> 08:32.360
of Italian Soviets.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.180
But the rest of the Italian Socialist Party didn't agree.

08:35.180 --> 08:39.100
According to William Peltz's book on the period, Against Capitalism, the workers' councils

08:39.100 --> 08:43.220
didn't just want to negotiate with the owners of the factories, they wanted to control the

08:43.220 --> 08:47.900
factories directly with the council structure taking the place of the owners, a demand that

08:47.900 --> 08:52.620
despite Gramsci's support, the Italian Socialist Party did not endorse.

08:52.620 --> 08:57.480
By 1921, the economy had become so disrupted and unproductive that the Italian working

08:57.480 --> 09:00.360
class was hit with mass layoffs and wage cuts.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.240
The workers' councils fell apart, and a lot of the people who supported them, feeling

09:03.240 --> 09:07.200
betrayed by the lack of direct action on the part of the Italian Socialist Party, would

09:07.200 --> 09:11.520
end up joining the Italian Fighting League and following Mussolini instead, as during

09:11.520 --> 09:16.320
this same period, they had proven themselves more than capable of engaging in direct violence

09:16.320 --> 09:17.680
against the liberal state.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.600
In fact, while Mussolini's initial backers were Italian veterans of the First World War,

09:21.600 --> 09:26.780
his first huge upswell of popular grassroots support were primarily farmers, factory workers,

09:26.780 --> 09:31.180
and middle-class laborers who were fed up with the Italian Socialist Party's all-talk,

09:31.180 --> 09:34.300
no-action reputation when it came to revolutionary action.

09:34.300 --> 09:39.340
It was the influence of these workers' councils that partially led Mussolini to adopt George

09:39.340 --> 09:43.900
Sorel's National Syndicalism philosophy when he began to conceptualize a more coherent

09:43.900 --> 09:45.340
fascist ideology.

09:45.340 --> 09:49.260
For Antonio Gramsci, all of this meant that he believed he was ultimately correct about

09:49.260 --> 09:52.460
the revolutionary potential of the factory workers' councils, and that the Italian

09:52.460 --> 09:56.400
Socialist Party had missed a vital chance to secure a revolution, something that Mussolini

09:56.400 --> 09:57.660
had taken advantage of.

09:57.660 --> 10:01.560
This was not the only split between Gramsci and the rest of the Italian Socialist Party.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.320
The militant group are diti del popo, or the people's daring ones.

10:05.320 --> 10:09.220
Socialist thugs, who were tasked with confronting Mussolini's equally thuggish blackshirts

10:09.220 --> 10:13.080
in the streets, was denounced by the Italian Socialist Party, but supported by Gramsci

10:13.080 --> 10:16.440
and Lenin as proletarian violence against fascism.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.940
By 1922, Gramsci was called to Moscow to receive official Russian support.

10:20.940 --> 10:23.980
It was here that he would meet his wife, with whom he had two sons.

10:23.980 --> 10:25.420
Gramsci would never see his youngest.

10:25.420 --> 10:29.560
Lenin instructed Gramsci to return to Italy, take leadership of the Italian Socialist Party,

10:29.560 --> 10:33.280
unite Italy's leftists, and provide a bulwark against fascism.

10:33.280 --> 10:36.820
While Gramsci was out of the country, Mussolini purged many of the leaders of the Italian

10:36.820 --> 10:41.180
Socialist Party, making Gramsci's task of taking control a lot easier when he returned.

10:41.180 --> 10:45.780
However, Gramsci made little progress in uniting Italy's left, because Mussolini's fascism

10:45.780 --> 10:48.860
proved to be significantly more popular among the working class.

10:48.860 --> 10:52.720
The revolutionary fervor of the proletariat against the liberal state was fulfilled through

10:52.720 --> 10:56.840
Mussolini's embracing of street violence, while the property and profit of the bourgeois

10:56.840 --> 11:01.200
was tentatively respected as long as they followed the direction of the fascists through

11:01.200 --> 11:04.120
the national syndicalist model Mussolini had imposed on them.

11:04.120 --> 11:08.600
It's no surprise to me that Mussolini was able to attract so many socialists, anarchists,

11:08.600 --> 11:12.300
and working class members to the fledgling fascism, despite their obvious differences.

11:12.320 --> 11:16.760
George Sorel famously stated that Mussolini's blending of the national and the social had

11:16.760 --> 11:21.360
made fascism a completely new philosophy outside of the understanding of the socialist dialectic,

11:21.360 --> 11:26.100
and that Mussolini was solving the contradictions of capitalism by destroying both the proletariat

11:26.100 --> 11:31.640
and the bourgeois as distinct classes, leaving only the state and its organs in their place.

11:31.640 --> 11:36.260
The popular view of fascism in its day was that it was the next political step of progress

11:36.260 --> 11:40.800
beyond socialism, a notion among Italy's working class that Antonio Gramsci failed

11:40.800 --> 11:42.780
to shake with his own activism.

11:42.780 --> 11:48.280
By September 11, 1926, Gino Lucetti, an anarchist with the People's Daring Ones, attempted

11:48.280 --> 11:52.580
to assassinate Mussolini by throwing a bomb at his limo during a public appearance.

11:52.580 --> 11:56.540
This attempt on his life, along with others in the same year, led to the abolishment of

11:56.540 --> 12:00.740
the Italian Socialist Party and the creation of OVRA, the Organization for Vigilance and

12:00.740 --> 12:04.060
Repression of Anti-Fascism, the fascist secret police in Italy.

12:04.060 --> 12:08.120
All Italian Socialist Party members, including Gramsci, were rounded up and imprisoned.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.960
There is some evidence that the fascists staged at least a few of the attacks on Mussolini's

12:11.960 --> 12:16.060
life as a pretense for gaining power, but the Lucetti bomb-throwing event is firmly

12:16.060 --> 12:19.980
established as not a false flag, but a real assassination attempt.

12:19.980 --> 12:24.480
In any case, it gave Mussolini the justification to finally wash away the last remnants of

12:24.480 --> 12:29.000
the old parliamentary democracy, and Gramsci, as the last remaining nexus of fascist resistance,

12:29.000 --> 12:30.300
was washed away along with it.

12:38.120 --> 12:52.720
The fascist recognized that Gramsci posed a significant threat to their movement due

12:52.720 --> 12:53.840
to his intellect.

12:53.840 --> 13:00.000
His prosecutor at trial famously stated, for 20 years, we must stop this brain from functioning.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.780
Gramsci survived 11 years behind bars, before finally dying at the age of 46.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.280
What killed him is debated.

13:06.280 --> 13:10.240
While there is no doubt that the fascists treated him exceptionally poorly behind bars,

13:10.240 --> 13:13.640
his situation was also exacerbated by his lifelong poor health.

13:13.640 --> 13:18.000
One of the forewords of the Prison Notebooks states that Mussolini moved Gramsci from prison

13:18.000 --> 13:21.960
to the hospital near the end of his life to make it look like he died of natural causes,

13:21.960 --> 13:24.040
a gambit that ultimately didn't work.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.180
And I guess that's as good a time as any to start talking about the Prison Notebooks.

13:27.180 --> 13:31.600
The Prison Notebooks are the most influential pieces of socialist theory that Antonio Gramsci

13:31.600 --> 13:33.000
contributed to the movement.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.520
They are a disorganized and often unfinished collection of essays, spread out across 33

13:37.520 --> 13:40.640
notebooks, written entirely while under fascist guard.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.360
Gramsci spent his 11 years behind bars, alternating between a jail cell, a doctor's office, and

13:45.360 --> 13:49.080
eventually due to his declining health and international outcry, in exile where he was

13:49.080 --> 13:52.280
permitted to go on short walks and was given magazines to read.

13:52.280 --> 13:55.540
This wasn't really freedom, though, as his walks were monitored by the fascists, all

13:55.540 --> 13:59.180
of his reading materials were pre-screened, and his letters to his family were read before

13:59.180 --> 14:01.160
they were delivered by Gramsci's sister-in-law.

14:01.160 --> 14:05.280
As a result, Gramsci had to be careful about what he wrote, as the fascist guards could

14:05.280 --> 14:08.860
at any time decide to read what he was up to, and they occasionally did.

14:08.860 --> 14:12.520
So Gramsci had to couch his language using more generalized terms.

14:12.520 --> 14:17.280
For example, Gramsci tends to use the phrase dominant group when talking about the bourgeois.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.560
The socialists have a language of their own in a sense, with terms like bourgeois, proletariat,

14:21.560 --> 14:25.040
means of production, and Gramsci avoided using them as much as possible.

14:25.040 --> 14:29.520
The Prison Notebooks were published with each essay being introduced by either Quentin Hoare

14:29.520 --> 14:33.520
or Geoffrey Noel Smith, the translators, each offering their own interpretation of

14:33.520 --> 14:34.520
the writing.

14:34.520 --> 14:38.440
Therefore, in order to avoid censorship by his fascist jailers, a lot of Gramsci's

14:38.440 --> 14:40.640
writing in the Prison Notebooks is indirect.

14:40.640 --> 14:44.640
In fact, the most famous example of this is that meme that began Sock Dunn-Leff's Twitter

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
thread.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.880
The quote being referenced here in this image of Bart and Homer is another of Gramsci's

14:48.880 --> 14:49.880
most famous lines.

14:49.880 --> 14:53.000
The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.440
Now is the time of monsters.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.860
I can see why it became a quote, it's quite poetic and evocative, and sometimes people

14:57.860 --> 15:01.580
use it to try to draw links between Gramsci and Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister.

15:01.580 --> 15:05.820
By pointing out that Goebbels said in 1939, we know today the old world is dying and we

15:05.820 --> 15:07.620
are seeing the struggle for a new world.

15:07.620 --> 15:08.880
But there's no link here.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.180
Before the Prison Notebooks were published, nobody outside of Gramsci, his friends who

15:12.180 --> 15:16.500
smuggled them out, and the low-level fascist guards who read them even knew of their existence.

15:16.500 --> 15:21.040
It's much more likely that because fascism and socialism are both modernist ideologies

15:21.040 --> 15:24.800
interested in revolution and rebirth, the wiping clean of old orders, and the construction

15:24.800 --> 15:29.120
of a new society, a new man, Gramsci and Goebbels appealed to the same sentiments out

15:29.120 --> 15:30.220
of coincidence.

15:30.220 --> 15:34.760
The original form of Gramsci's monsters quote is, the crisis consists precisely in

15:34.760 --> 15:37.800
the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.

15:37.800 --> 15:41.580
In this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.

15:41.580 --> 15:43.360
What are these morbid symptoms?

15:43.360 --> 15:44.360
Gramsci doesn't really say.

15:44.360 --> 15:48.200
The next sentence reads, this paragraph should be completed by some observations which I

15:48.200 --> 15:50.860
made on the so-called problem of the younger generation.

15:50.860 --> 15:53.300
Like I said, a lot of these essays went unfinished.

15:53.300 --> 15:56.600
So what did he mean by morbid symptoms?

15:56.600 --> 16:00.720
Some people think that Gramsci meant the emergence of fascism in the face of revolutionary worker

16:00.720 --> 16:05.100
fervor and the failure of the Italian Socialist Party in, uh, capitalizing on the opportunity.

16:05.100 --> 16:09.020
However, other people think that he meant the Italian Socialist Party's ultra-left-wing

16:09.020 --> 16:13.040
turn at the Third International, abandoning their liberal and social democratic allies

16:13.040 --> 16:16.540
at Lenin's encouragement, under the misguided belief that fascism was going to collapse

16:16.540 --> 16:18.040
all on its own within months.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.260
There's no clear answer here.

16:19.260 --> 16:23.120
The point I'm getting at is, in actually examining the content of the Prison Notebooks,

16:23.120 --> 16:26.620
you have to read between the lines a bit more than you might otherwise.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.420
Gramsci's not going to come out and say what he's advocating, the way that Karl Marx

16:29.420 --> 16:30.420
did in the Communist Manifesto.

16:30.420 --> 16:34.500
And I know that Sock Dunleff's whole argument hinges on, but Gramsci didn't specifically

16:34.500 --> 16:35.500
say that.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
But come on, you're a socialist.

16:36.500 --> 16:40.480
You're used to hearing dog whistles everywhere, from edgy jokes about the Holocaust, to stone

16:40.480 --> 16:42.100
toss comics, to gamer words.

16:42.100 --> 16:46.660
Hell, you even made an entire other article about dog whistling, what it is, how to spot

16:46.660 --> 16:47.660
it, why it's bad.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.700
Oh, except you don't think it's bad, as long as your side is the one doing it, of

16:50.700 --> 16:51.700
course.

16:51.700 --> 16:55.000
If you're just straining yourself to read between the lines so hard that you think people

16:55.000 --> 17:00.000
like Sargon, or hell, even somebody as milquetoast as Tim Pool are fascists, then you can read

17:00.000 --> 17:03.180
between the lines a little bit for Antonio Gramsci as well.

17:03.180 --> 17:07.160
When Sock Dunleff said, correctly, that the quote conservatives throw around was a false

17:07.160 --> 17:08.720
one, I replied on Twitter with,

17:08.720 --> 17:13.440
It's true this quote is fake, but the idea behind it is absolutely Gramsciant, despite

17:13.440 --> 17:14.880
what SDL claims.

17:14.880 --> 17:19.400
The section, The Formation of the Intellectuals, from the Prison Notebooks, outlines Gramsci's

17:19.400 --> 17:22.960
call for socialists to subvert morality-creating cultural institutions.

17:22.960 --> 17:23.960
He replied to me with,

17:23.960 --> 17:24.960
Provide a quotation!

17:24.960 --> 17:28.080
In that essay, which is mostly descriptive with few prescriptions, Gramsci says nothing

17:28.080 --> 17:29.080
like that.

17:29.080 --> 17:32.900
He then cites the summary of the essay provided by the translator, which basically says that

17:32.900 --> 17:37.420
the working class can organically create its own intellectual to counter the bourgeois

17:37.420 --> 17:42.820
intellectual, provide their own ideas outside of bourgeois control, and begin to build counter-hegemony.

17:42.820 --> 17:47.380
He then cites Gramsci describing his own newspaper's goal of creating that new type of working

17:47.380 --> 17:50.180
class intellectual, even highlighting this passage.

17:50.180 --> 17:54.020
One of the most important characteristics of any group that is developing towards dominance

17:54.020 --> 17:57.660
is its struggle to assimilate and to conquer ideologically the traditional intellectuals.

17:57.660 --> 18:01.440
But this assimilation and conquest is made quicker and more efficacious the more the

18:01.440 --> 18:06.140
group in question succeeds in simultaneously elaborating its own organic intellectuals.

18:06.140 --> 18:09.360
Now, I don't know why Sock Dunleff thought this was an own.

18:09.360 --> 18:13.380
Gramsci is describing a portion of Lenin's dual power theory here, where socialists should

18:13.380 --> 18:17.340
build up working class alternatives to the various components of bourgeois society.

18:17.340 --> 18:20.660
Gramsci is only talking about intellectuals, but Lenin applied dual power theory to all

18:20.660 --> 18:24.260
of society's institutions, so that these alternatives are ready to go when bourgeois

18:24.260 --> 18:26.020
society falls to the revolution.

18:26.020 --> 18:30.740
In this quote, Gramsci is describing how a dominant group maintains ideological control

18:30.740 --> 18:35.260
over society using their intellectuals, and so a subversive group has to create their

18:35.260 --> 18:39.060
own intellectuals with their own ideas as part of countering the effect.

18:39.060 --> 18:43.460
Sock Dunleff is technically correct when he says that even though Gramsci describes what's

18:43.460 --> 18:46.980
going on here, he doesn't take the final step and explicitly come out and say that's

18:46.980 --> 18:48.620
what socialists should do.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.500
For example, at the beginning of the essay, he writes,

18:50.500 --> 18:54.740
The capitalist entrepreneur creates alongside himself the industrial technician, the specialist

18:54.740 --> 18:58.500
in political economy, the organizers of a new culture, of a new legal system, etc.

18:58.500 --> 19:01.980
He doesn't end the statement with, And we should build up our own counters to do this,

19:01.980 --> 19:04.620
because, um, remember the fascist guards looking over his shoulder?

19:04.620 --> 19:09.300
The Prison Notebooks mainly consists of detailed insights into how, in Gramsci's view, the

19:09.300 --> 19:13.740
bourgeois delicately controlled the various knobs and levers of society to keep themselves

19:13.740 --> 19:14.740
in power.

19:14.740 --> 19:18.980
It is only due to circumstance that he was required to leave the final step of the revolutionary

19:18.980 --> 19:28.620
process, the call to act on this understanding, in the hands of the reader.

19:28.620 --> 19:33.020
The main contribution that Antonio Gramsci made to socialist theory in The Prison Notebooks

19:33.020 --> 19:35.200
is the concept of cultural hegemony.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.700
Is it hegemony or hegemony?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.140
I'll use hegemony.

19:38.140 --> 19:41.560
Marxian socialism had a predictive element to it, that the socialist revolution would

19:41.560 --> 19:45.540
inevitably happen, just as feudalism had collapsed into capitalism before it, as a

19:45.540 --> 19:47.700
natural part of the march of progress.

19:47.700 --> 19:52.840
By the early 20th century, it was widely adopted by socialists that Marx was wrong about this.

19:52.840 --> 19:55.840
Socialism split into a number of post-Marxist schools of thought.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.320
One that we've spoken about extensively on this channel was Sorelianism, where George

19:59.320 --> 20:03.820
Sorel planted the seeds for fascism through his belief that a revolution against international

20:03.820 --> 20:06.160
capital had to be a nationalist one.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.180
Leninism, meanwhile, consists of Lenin's belief that a group of socialist intellectuals,

20:10.180 --> 20:14.320
known as the vanguard, had to control the state and reeducate the people with the proper

20:14.320 --> 20:17.900
political consciousness before any true socialism could appear.

20:17.900 --> 20:20.000
Gramsci in thought, however, is different.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.740
Gramsci believed that the reason the workers did not revolt against the bourgeois, as Marx

20:23.740 --> 20:27.380
had predicted, is because they were subsumed in bourgeois culture.

20:27.380 --> 20:31.460
The bourgeois propagated its own values into the minds of the proletariat in the form of

20:31.460 --> 20:35.900
what we call common sense, making them act out cultural values that were against their

20:35.900 --> 20:37.500
own material interests.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.500
A simplistic example is, you might be told as a child that stealing from a shop is immoral

20:41.500 --> 20:43.780
for a number of reasons, religious, economic.

20:43.780 --> 20:47.200
But Gramscians would argue that it's only immoral because the bourgeois wants you to

20:47.200 --> 20:51.160
think it's immoral, because they have something to gain if you don't steal.

20:51.160 --> 20:55.660
In this view, all of the values of a capitalist society serve to prevent a workers' revolution,

20:55.660 --> 21:00.140
while the society in question presents those values as normal or natural or obvious when

21:00.140 --> 21:02.420
they are in fact imposed.

21:02.420 --> 21:06.380
Gramsci identified the two halves that propagate this bourgeois culture, using two different

21:06.380 --> 21:07.380
methods.

21:07.380 --> 21:11.120
The first he called political society, the police, the army, the legal system, the government.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.420
These institutions spread bourgeois culture through force.

21:14.420 --> 21:18.040
These are the components of society that will come for you if you don't accept and live

21:18.040 --> 21:19.620
by bourgeois culture.

21:19.620 --> 21:23.900
The second he called civil society, the family, the schools, the churches, the unions, the

21:23.900 --> 21:24.900
media.

21:24.900 --> 21:29.060
These institutions don't use force, but they secure consent from the people through a combination

21:29.060 --> 21:31.020
of incentives and social pressures.

21:31.020 --> 21:35.180
In this way, the people spread the same bourgeois culture to each other that prevents them from

21:35.180 --> 21:36.980
revolting against capitalism.

21:36.980 --> 21:40.540
Gramsci believed that working class intellectuals, separate from the traditional intellectuals

21:40.540 --> 21:44.960
of bourgeois society, needed to develop an entirely separate value system and ideology

21:44.960 --> 21:49.020
in order to be able to combat the cultural hegemony the bourgeois held over society.

21:49.020 --> 21:52.180
This development of an alternative morality and culture to challenge bourgeois hegemony

21:52.180 --> 21:56.380
is what Gramsci called the War of Position, contrasted with the War of Maneuver, which

21:56.380 --> 21:57.700
is a direct revolution.

21:57.700 --> 22:02.020
Gramsci theorized that in Russia, a war of position to dismantle bourgeois hegemony was

22:02.020 --> 22:05.940
not necessary before a war of maneuver could take place, because Russia's bourgeois had

22:05.940 --> 22:08.040
never actually achieved any hegemony.

22:08.040 --> 22:12.000
This was not the case in more industrialized, centralized, and urbanized states, making

22:12.000 --> 22:15.840
the development of alternative culture and morality a necessity before any direct revolution

22:15.840 --> 22:17.180
could be successful.

22:17.180 --> 22:21.980
Gramsci specifically described this process with the word subversive, and how even peasants

22:21.980 --> 22:27.140
who had not yet fostered any class consciousness were still reflexively subversive when encountering

22:27.140 --> 22:29.380
civil servants working for the modern state.

22:29.380 --> 22:32.700
These peasants didn't have the education to understand the modern state, but they did

22:32.700 --> 22:37.620
intuitively know that the local civil servant who came around was not somebody to be trusted.

22:37.620 --> 22:41.660
This instinctive reflex was, for Gramsci, indicative of the underlying desire for the

22:41.660 --> 22:44.260
working class to be free of bourgeois hegemony.

22:44.260 --> 22:47.700
In one of his newspaper articles, Gramsci also chided Mussolini for claiming that the

22:47.700 --> 22:49.820
latter could ever be considered truly subversive.

22:49.820 --> 22:53.300
From a modern perspective, that's actually quite strange, listening to socialists and

22:53.300 --> 22:57.700
fascists argue over who the true subversive is, wanting to claim the label because it's

22:57.700 --> 22:58.700
considered positive.

22:58.700 --> 23:02.000
Nowadays, both of them try desperately to ditch the title, and claim that the other

23:02.000 --> 23:04.040
is the one who's lying constantly.

23:04.040 --> 23:07.580
Here's where we get to what is, for me personally, the really interesting bit.

23:07.580 --> 23:11.200
In the Twitter thread, Sock Done Left claims that the conservative intellectual ecosystem

23:11.200 --> 23:15.580
is broken, that all of these right-wing creators and talking heads are using this false Gramsci

23:15.580 --> 23:19.520
quote to spread the idea that socialists have the goal of infiltrating institutions to turn

23:19.520 --> 23:23.840
the culture socialist as a prelude to a revolution, the war of position before the war of maneuver,

23:23.840 --> 23:28.080
and that this is the justification the right is leaning on to seize the institutions back.

23:28.080 --> 23:31.520
And where Sock Done Left is correct is not only that the Gramsci quote is false, but

23:31.560 --> 23:35.800
also that Gramsci never explicitly said, seized the institutions and cultural production and

23:35.800 --> 23:39.600
turned them socialist, again due to the fact that he was writing in a fascist prison.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.040
Most of the prison notebooks are descriptions, not prescriptions.

23:42.040 --> 23:46.420
It's Gramsci outlining what he sees the bourgeois doing to establish cultural hegemony,

23:46.420 --> 23:49.240
and what working-class intellectuals could do to create counter-hegemony.

23:49.240 --> 23:53.160
He never actually says, do it, just like a person who doxxes somebody never actually

23:53.160 --> 23:56.080
says go harass them, but we can read between the lines.

23:56.080 --> 24:00.240
But Gramsci did make some overt prescriptions that slipped by the censors.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.320
The most important one was that although the working-class intellectuals were tasked

24:04.320 --> 24:08.180
with the creation of a new type of education, morality, and culture, they were actually

24:08.180 --> 24:12.400
not instructed to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat

24:12.400 --> 24:17.060
as a set of foreign notions, but instead they were to co-opt existing intellectual activities

24:17.060 --> 24:20.880
of the working class and make them inherently critical of the status quo.

24:20.880 --> 24:24.720
It's possible that Gramsci did not advocate for direct Marxist education out of fear of

24:24.720 --> 24:28.960
the censors, hoping that any future comrades would also be able to read between the lines.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.440
But it's also possible that Gramsci did not believe that direct propagandizing would

24:32.440 --> 24:36.880
be effective, that a true awakening of class consciousness would require dismantling bourgeois

24:36.880 --> 24:42.240
hegemony first, and letting the working-class's natural subversiveness blossom all on its

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
own.

24:43.240 --> 24:46.640
But all of this is a far cry from saying that the rightoids of today are lying grifters

24:46.640 --> 24:50.140
who don't care about the truth, that their intellectual ecosystem is broken.

24:50.140 --> 24:55.360
Sock Dunn Left explicitly states in the thread that rightist pundits use a fake Gramsci quote

24:55.360 --> 25:00.280
to justify the existence of a secret communist conspiracy, but then in his article he says

25:00.280 --> 25:05.160
that Gramsci and those socialists descended from him argued for socialists attempting

25:05.160 --> 25:09.720
to construct dual power structures to win the coercion battle along with gradually moving

25:09.720 --> 25:12.560
culture production leftward to win the consent battle.

25:12.560 --> 25:17.640
Sock Dunn Left literally says right here that what the right wing says Gramsci believed

25:17.640 --> 25:21.680
in that fake quote is actually what Gramsci believed.

25:21.680 --> 25:25.040
Conservatives love to trot out these quotes in order to suggest that leftists are engaged

25:25.040 --> 25:27.920
in a grand conspiracy to take over institutions from within.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.440
Yeah, but that's true though.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.440
Gramsci wrote it.

25:30.440 --> 25:34.480
You even say in your article that you actually want there to be a secret cabal of leftists

25:34.480 --> 25:36.240
controlling everything.

25:36.240 --> 25:39.840
Leftists are engaged in a conspiracy to take over institutions from within.

25:39.840 --> 25:43.400
They may not be as effective as you want them to be, or as the right says that they are,

25:43.400 --> 25:46.320
but putting aside the effectiveness, does the effort exist?

25:46.320 --> 25:49.200
The only possible answer to that is yes.

25:56.040 --> 26:01.360
Lots of people who talk about critical race theory online have no idea what it is.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.800
Those few people who have read the writings of critical theorists, however, all report

26:04.800 --> 26:07.960
that they are directly descended from Gramscian socialism.

26:07.960 --> 26:11.400
Sargon did something like 10 videos going over the various components of the critical

26:11.400 --> 26:14.880
race theory bible, and those are worthwhile videos to watch for sure.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.560
But I found personally that when I was watching them I wasn't actually learning very much

26:18.560 --> 26:21.680
— sorry Sargon — I was instead remembering it.

26:21.680 --> 26:25.000
Because for me, this is all stuff that I had already personally encountered and kind

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
of forgotten about.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.280
In the first year university course, Introduction to Critical Theory, that I took back in 2007.

26:31.280 --> 26:35.240
Here's my textbook from that class, Critical Theory Today by Lois Tyson, second edition,

26:35.240 --> 26:38.160
though I understand there's been several newer versions of the book since I've graduated.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.400
Let's trace the genealogy of the post-Gramscian socialist movement.

26:41.400 --> 26:45.640
The Hungarian thinker Georgi Lukas is one of the most influential philosophers of what

26:45.640 --> 26:47.500
would eventually become critical theory.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.080
He had a similar intellectual development as Antonio Gramsci.

26:50.080 --> 26:54.580
He went off to university and discovered the philosophies of Marx, Sorel, Hegel, Kierkegaard,

26:54.580 --> 26:55.580
and Gentile.

26:55.580 --> 26:59.120
The Russian Revolution of 1917 inspired him to become a committed Marxist, and though

26:59.120 --> 27:05.040
he was somewhat critical of Leninism, he nonetheless became a commissar in the short-lived 1919

27:05.040 --> 27:08.760
Hungarian Soviet Republic and committed atrocities you'd expect from that station.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.160
After that state was crushed in the Hungarian Civil War, Lukas fled to Italy.

27:13.160 --> 27:17.560
Gramsci and Lukas were in Vienna at the same time in the 1920s, and though they never met,

27:17.560 --> 27:22.120
Gramsci's ideas were introduced to Lukas through a mutual comrade, the Belgian-Russian

27:22.120 --> 27:26.160
anarchist Victor Serge, who really has nothing to his name other than getting Gramsci's

27:26.160 --> 27:27.160
ideas out there.

27:27.160 --> 27:30.560
Serge moved back to Russia, opposed Lenin, was exiled, and died.

27:30.560 --> 27:34.920
Lukas traveled to the Soviet Union in 1933 to take up a spot in a Moscow university and

27:34.920 --> 27:38.920
was not allowed to leave, first due to the outbreak of the Second World War and, secondly,

27:38.920 --> 27:40.960
due to being exiled in Stalin's Great Purge.

27:40.960 --> 27:45.600
By the time he returned to Hungary in 1945, it was again a Soviet state, and he joined

27:45.600 --> 27:48.740
the Hungarian Communist Party, taking on an administrative role.

27:48.740 --> 27:52.500
Though Lukas was ultimately critical of Stalin and the Soviet regimes of Eastern Europe as

27:52.500 --> 27:57.600
not being true socialism, he kept those beliefs under wraps until after Stalin's death.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.960
He spent his remaining years advocating for socialism, but critical of its current form.

28:01.960 --> 28:06.260
Georgi Lukas contributed a lot to political theory and history, I've only just skimmed

28:06.260 --> 28:11.320
over his biography, but what concerns us today is his involvement in the Frankfurt School.

28:11.320 --> 28:15.560
The Frankfurt School began as a physical school, the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.120
But it eventually became a school of thought.

28:18.120 --> 28:22.000
Lukas was one of the school's founders and published a work that is just as influential

28:22.000 --> 28:25.760
as Gramsci's prison notebooks, History and Class Consciousness.

28:25.760 --> 28:30.240
In this book, Lukas argues that Marxism is not only a theory of political economy that

28:30.240 --> 28:34.400
improves upon its bourgeois predecessors by advancing the dialectic, nor is it only a

28:34.400 --> 28:39.040
scientific sociology like the natural sciences, but it is also a critique, a self-conscious

28:39.040 --> 28:40.780
transformation of society.

28:40.780 --> 28:44.680
The old Marxist purists argued that Marxism made philosophy obsolete.

28:44.680 --> 28:49.480
But these new Marxists, commonly called Western Marxists like Lukas and Gramsci, claimed that

28:49.480 --> 28:55.000
Marxism preserves the truths of philosophy until revolution can transform them into reality.

28:55.000 --> 28:59.900
This process was explored by Marx, but was popularized by Lukas using the term reification.

28:59.900 --> 29:04.380
To reify something means to take something that is abstract and make it a real object.

29:04.380 --> 29:09.060
To use a modern comparison, what objectification is to people, reification is to ideas.

29:09.060 --> 29:13.460
The Frankfurt School was heavily influenced by the rise of fascism in Europe in two ways.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.880
First, the intellectuals of the school applied their interpretations of Marxist political

29:16.880 --> 29:21.580
theory to try and explain why fascism, and not socialism, had been the result of widespread

29:21.580 --> 29:23.060
working-class revolt.

29:23.060 --> 29:26.820
Secondly, when Germany became too unsafe for them to continue their work as the Nazis rose

29:26.820 --> 29:30.460
to power, the school was moved to the United States, along with most of its members, though

29:30.460 --> 29:34.100
Georgi Lukas was a notable exception who remained behind in Europe.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.540
Everyone actually involved in the Frankfurt School is notable enough that they each deserve

29:37.540 --> 29:41.380
a video in their own right, especially Herbert Marcuse, another person Sargon's covered

29:41.380 --> 29:45.260
over at the Lotus Eaters, and there just isn't enough time to talk about them all right now.

29:45.260 --> 29:49.060
But the leader of the Frankfurt School in America, the German sociologist Max Horkheimer,

29:49.060 --> 29:53.740
wrote in his 1937 work, Traditional and Critical Theory, that critical theory as an intellectual

29:53.740 --> 29:59.420
tradition was a social critique meant to affect political change and foster intellectual enlightenment,

29:59.420 --> 30:02.780
an idea that is likely descended from Gramsci through Lukas.

30:02.780 --> 30:07.200
Meanwhile, the Frankfurt School had influenced a community of French intellectuals who, while

30:07.200 --> 30:10.960
not a part of the school, were still Western Marxists and critical theorists.

30:10.960 --> 30:14.760
Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist, his partner Simone de Beauvoir, who pretty

30:14.760 --> 30:19.400
much kickstarted feminism's second wave, with her 1949 book, The Second Sex, Jacques Derrida,

30:19.400 --> 30:23.340
who developed the philosophy of deconstruction, Michael Foucault, probably the most famous

30:23.340 --> 30:24.720
postmodernist of all time.

30:24.720 --> 30:28.320
Again, I've got a lot to say about each of these people, and now is not the time, but

30:28.320 --> 30:32.800
even a cursory glance will recognize the Gramsci-ian influence in their philosophy.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.820
They all, in their own way, advocated for the critiquing of society through its institutions

30:36.820 --> 30:40.600
to subvert hegemonic culture and create space for change.

30:40.600 --> 30:44.480
Probably the most blatant Gramsci-ian activist of this period was Rudi Duchké, which is

30:44.480 --> 30:48.820
ironic because Duchké never actually mentioned Gramsci at all, in any of his writing, but

30:48.820 --> 30:52.900
like everyone else, during his time at university, he was heavily influenced by pretty much everyone

30:52.900 --> 30:53.900
I just listed.

30:53.900 --> 30:56.540
All the thinkers of the Frankfurt School, all the French critical theorists, Georgi

30:56.540 --> 31:01.020
Lukas and Mao Zedong and Lenin, and it's in Duchké's ideas that things really begin

31:01.020 --> 31:02.020
to take shape.

31:02.020 --> 31:05.740
Duchké coined the phrase, the long march through the institutions, to describe the

31:05.740 --> 31:09.860
necessity for socialist revolutionaries to subvert capitalist domination of society

31:09.860 --> 31:14.620
by taking up positions from within these institutions and slowly turning them towards socialism.

31:14.620 --> 31:18.340
By the way, even as Sokhton Left said that conservatives were grifters for thinking that

31:18.340 --> 31:22.620
this was a socialist goal, he cited Duchké in the article saying that this was his goal.

31:22.620 --> 31:26.660
It is unreal how these people will piss on your face and tell you it's raining.

31:26.660 --> 31:30.420
Duchké took the phrase, long march through the institutions, from Mao Zedong's Long

31:30.420 --> 31:34.100
March, which was a strategic retreat that the Chinese Red Army undertook in order to

31:34.100 --> 31:36.460
evade the pursuit of the Chinese nationalists.

31:36.460 --> 31:41.300
It was a grueling event in the Chinese Communist Party's history, covering over 9,000 kilometers

31:41.300 --> 31:45.340
across 370 days through the toughest terrain of Western China.

31:45.340 --> 31:49.120
And by the end of it, Mao Zedong had been cemented in the minds of the Chinese Communists

31:49.120 --> 31:50.820
as their undisputed leader.

31:50.820 --> 31:55.300
Duchké's use of the phrase, long march, was meant to evoke the idea of a protracted,

31:55.300 --> 32:00.060
bitter struggle against capitalist forces seeking them out, and how evasion and subversion

32:00.060 --> 32:03.920
across a large enough time frame would lead to a prestigious victory.

32:03.920 --> 32:08.160
Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School explicitly supported Rudi Duchké's idea of a long

32:08.160 --> 32:12.680
march through the institutions, writing in a counter-revolution and revolt, working against

32:12.680 --> 32:17.080
the established institutions while working within them, but not simply by boring from

32:17.080 --> 32:21.440
within, rather by doing the job, learning how to program and read computers, how to

32:21.440 --> 32:25.720
teach at all levels of education, how to use mass media, how to organize production, how

32:25.720 --> 32:30.800
to design, etc., and at the same time preserving one's own consciousness in working with

32:30.800 --> 32:31.800
others.

32:31.800 --> 32:35.000
This march includes the concentrated effort to build up counter-institutions.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.300
They have long been an aim of the movement, but the lack of funds was greatly responsible

32:39.300 --> 32:41.520
for their weakness and their inferior quality.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.080
They must be made competitive.

32:43.080 --> 32:46.320
This is especially important for the development of radical free media.

32:46.320 --> 32:50.880
The fact that the radical left has no equal access to the great chains of information

32:50.880 --> 32:54.240
and indoctrination is largely responsible for its isolation.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.200
Similarly with the development of independent schools and free universities.

32:58.200 --> 33:02.520
They can be competitive, that is to say apt to counteract establishment education, only

33:02.520 --> 33:07.040
where they fill a vacuum of where their quality is not only different but also superior.

33:07.040 --> 33:11.240
The collection of large funds for the operation of effective counter-institutions requires

33:11.240 --> 33:12.240
compromises.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.780
The time of the wholesale rejection of the liberals has passed, or has not yet come.

33:16.780 --> 33:20.820
Radicalism has much to gain from the legitimate protest against the war, inflation, unemployment,

33:20.820 --> 33:25.240
from the defense of civil rights, even perhaps from a lesser evil in local elections.

33:25.240 --> 33:29.360
The ground for the building of a united front is shifting and sometimes dirty, but it is

33:29.360 --> 33:30.360
there.

33:30.360 --> 33:33.400
I have stressed the key role which the universities play in the present period.

33:33.400 --> 33:37.120
They can still function as institutions for the training of counter-cadres.

33:37.120 --> 33:41.540
The restructuring necessary for the attainment of this goal means more than decisive student

33:41.540 --> 33:44.280
participation and non-authoritarian learning.

33:44.280 --> 33:48.440
Though Dutschke had no knowledge of Gramsci, Marcuse certainly did due to his involvement

33:48.440 --> 33:49.520
in the Frankfurt School.

33:49.520 --> 33:52.920
And though Dutschke would ultimately have little effect on any socialist movement, suffering

33:52.920 --> 33:57.240
from a seizure while in the bath and drowning at the age of 39, Marcuse would adopt the

33:57.240 --> 34:01.540
long march through the institutions into his own work and carry it forward with the rest

34:01.540 --> 34:15.880
of the Frankfurt School.

34:15.880 --> 34:20.040
In the book The Critical Turn in Education, from Marxist critique to post-structuralist

34:20.040 --> 34:24.080
feminism to critical theories of race, it's described that the Frankfurt School entered

34:24.080 --> 34:29.080
into a period of decline correlated with neo-conservatives becoming the dominant American rightist faction,

34:29.080 --> 34:34.280
beating out paleoconservatives and libertarians in the right-wing civil war of the late 1970s.

34:34.280 --> 34:38.240
As a result, critical theory as a discipline began to slowly fracture into separate strains

34:38.240 --> 34:39.720
over the years.

34:39.720 --> 34:43.480
Postcolonial theory, queer theory, feminist theory, and most famously, at least in modern

34:43.480 --> 34:44.880
terms, critical race theory.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.880
I was lucky.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.600
My textbook included a section on all of them.

34:47.600 --> 34:51.640
Yes, critical race theory is one of the right-wing's current boogeymen, though the trans stuff

34:51.640 --> 34:53.920
seems to be currently overtaking it for the top spot.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.520
And before you ask, yes, there is a form of critical trans theory too.

34:57.520 --> 34:58.960
It's included in queer theory.

34:58.960 --> 35:02.340
And honestly, all of these different branches function pretty much exactly the same way.

35:02.340 --> 35:05.920
And they can all have their lineage traced back through the Frankfurt School, to Herbert

35:05.920 --> 35:09.920
Marcuse, to Max Horkheimer, to Georgi Lucas, to Antonio Gramsci.

35:09.920 --> 35:13.280
The core Gramsciian idea still remains in critical theory.

35:13.280 --> 35:17.220
In order to subvert bourgeois hegemony, you must construct counter-hegemony.

35:17.220 --> 35:21.220
This means subversive intellectuals who create alternative morality and produce alternative

35:21.220 --> 35:22.520
cultural output.

35:22.520 --> 35:27.020
These would form into organic-appearing countercultures that would drum up revolutionary fervor in

35:27.020 --> 35:28.940
the mind of the normal working-class person.

35:28.940 --> 35:32.620
And even if it didn't, it would leave them highly critical of their own society and weak

35:32.620 --> 35:33.620
to further propaganda.

35:33.620 --> 35:37.560
It's pretty much the same thing that Yuri Bezmenov described the Soviet Union doing

35:37.560 --> 35:40.740
through infiltration of Western academia, but with one big difference.

35:40.740 --> 35:45.100
The Soviet active measures program was designed to demoralize an enemy population with planted

35:45.100 --> 35:46.100
agents.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.740
The critical theorists, meanwhile, weren't planted by the Soviets.

35:48.740 --> 35:53.420
They engage in subversive action in the hope of fostering a homegrown revolution not beholden

35:53.420 --> 35:55.060
to foreign socialists.

35:55.060 --> 35:58.300
This book is Critical Race Theory, the key writings that form the movement.

35:58.300 --> 36:02.980
It's a long, boring, arcane tome that I am certain most conservatives have never even

36:02.980 --> 36:05.780
read despite constantly citing this movement.

36:05.780 --> 36:06.780
But it is important.

36:06.780 --> 36:10.020
It's a collection of essays compiled by Kimberle Crenshaw, a civil rights advocate

36:10.020 --> 36:12.820
and the creator of what we now know as intersectional theory.

36:12.820 --> 36:17.820
She coined the term intersectionality in 1989 as a way to describe the oppression of African-American

36:17.820 --> 36:18.820
women.

36:18.820 --> 36:22.380
Crenshaw noticed that oppression based on race and oppression based on sex were separate

36:22.380 --> 36:23.380
but intertwined.

36:23.380 --> 36:26.780
And in the wake of the dissolution of the Frankfurt School in America and the fracturing

36:26.780 --> 36:31.040
of critical theory as a discipline into separate groups, she found that she needed new language

36:31.040 --> 36:33.860
to describe the intersection of race and sex.

36:33.860 --> 36:38.240
Though the majority of prominent black activists of the second half of the 20th century were

36:38.240 --> 36:43.520
all students of the original American Frankfurt School members, most notably Herbert Marcuse

36:43.520 --> 36:47.080
mentoring Angela Davis, Kimberle Crenshaw was not one of them.

36:47.080 --> 36:51.600
Crenshaw came to the idea of intersectionality after reading the writing of black activists

36:51.600 --> 36:56.640
not descended from the Frankfurt School, like Sojourner Truth and Anna Julia Hayward Cooper.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.800
Crenshaw observed during her time at university that the intersection of race and gender was

37:00.800 --> 37:05.480
not well understood and that rather than the overlapping oppressions simply stacking up,

37:05.480 --> 37:08.680
gender gave racial oppression a unique dynamic and vice versa.

37:08.680 --> 37:12.600
However, Kimberle Crenshaw would eventually work with descendants of the Frankfurt School

37:12.600 --> 37:15.160
like Angela Davis and they would influence each other.

37:15.160 --> 37:18.720
Crenshaw would give them intersectionality and they would give in return Gramsci's

37:18.720 --> 37:19.720
cultural hegemony.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.640
Also, I know I'm dropping a lot of names in here right now, they really all do deserve

37:22.640 --> 37:24.440
a deep dive and it can't be today.

37:24.440 --> 37:28.760
The TLDR of Angela Davis is that she's a black activist whose legally owned guns were

37:28.760 --> 37:33.000
given to the perpetrators of an armed takeover of a courtroom and the execution of a judge

37:33.000 --> 37:37.480
in California in 1970, as well as a communist who believed that the prisoners of the Soviet

37:37.480 --> 37:42.680
Union and its satellite states deserved to be purged because they were Zionist fascists

37:42.680 --> 37:44.120
and opponents of socialism.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.880
Yes, those were her words.

37:45.880 --> 37:49.600
She has a long history of supporting political violence, repressive governments, and genuinely

37:49.600 --> 37:53.900
awful organizations in the name of feminism, socialism, and black liberation.

37:53.900 --> 37:58.120
In the modern day, she has taken on the public persona of being like any other aged black

37:58.120 --> 38:01.280
activist, her violent past having largely been forgotten.

38:01.320 --> 38:06.320
Meanwhile, Kimberle Crenshaw's area of expertise was in law and she applied Gramsci's cultural

38:06.320 --> 38:09.160
hegemony to that sphere, creating critical legal theory.

38:09.160 --> 38:13.440
She theorized that laws exist to maintain society's status quo and that in so far

38:13.440 --> 38:17.220
as that status quo is bigoted, the law serves to codify that bigotry.

38:17.220 --> 38:21.160
In this way, the liberals' colorblindness will always be racist, in Crenshaw's view

38:21.160 --> 38:25.560
anyway, because that colorblindness must necessarily insist on an equality that doesn't exist.

38:25.560 --> 38:29.320
For Crenshaw, if the law treats everyone equally without prejudice, then it is blind to the

38:29.320 --> 38:33.680
reason as to why, say, more black people are locked up per capita than white people

38:33.680 --> 38:34.680
in America.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.440
And for Crenshaw, the solution to that problem is a Gramsciian one.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.120
Subvert the process and develop counter hegemony.

38:40.120 --> 38:43.780
Critical race theory and critical gender theory and queer theory, all of it, it is all descended

38:43.780 --> 38:44.960
from this origin.

38:44.960 --> 38:48.680
This is why so many leftists will say, why are you so pissed that CRT is being taught

38:48.680 --> 38:49.680
in schools?

38:49.680 --> 38:50.680
It's just a legal thing.

38:50.680 --> 38:51.680
You don't even know what CRT is.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.820
And yeah, a lot of conservatives don't know what CRT is.

38:53.820 --> 38:55.920
But this is why you should be pissed.

38:55.920 --> 38:56.920
It's anti-liberal.

38:56.920 --> 39:01.480
Therefore, critical race theory, being Gramsciian in origin, posits that in America, bourgeois

39:01.480 --> 39:06.540
hegemony is white hegemony, that countercultural action to foster liberation must be through

39:06.540 --> 39:10.880
black culture, and that liberalism's attempt to create a neutral playing field through

39:10.880 --> 39:16.840
colorblind value-neutral policies only serves to reinforce white hegemony by not explicitly

39:16.840 --> 39:18.520
privileging black people.

39:18.520 --> 39:23.260
Kimberle Crenshaw has no problem in her own writing making this explicitly clear.

39:23.260 --> 39:27.140
In her article, Race, Reform, and Retrenchment, she writes,

39:27.140 --> 39:31.460
Oppressed people sometimes advance by creating ideological and political crisis, but the

39:31.460 --> 39:36.700
form of the crisis-producing challenge must reflect the institutional logic of the system.

39:36.700 --> 39:40.860
Gramsci called the struggle a war of position, and he regarded it as the most appropriate

39:40.860 --> 39:43.380
strategy for change in Western societies.

39:43.380 --> 39:47.960
According to Gramsci, direct challenges to the dominant class accomplish little if ideology

39:47.960 --> 39:51.860
plays such a central role in establishing authority that the legitimacy of the dominant

39:51.860 --> 39:53.420
regime is not challenged.

39:53.420 --> 39:57.980
Consequently, the challenges in such societies is to create a counter-hegemony by maneuvering

39:57.980 --> 40:02.080
within and expanding the dominant ideology to embrace the potential for change.

40:02.080 --> 40:06.380
Both critical race theorists and intersectional feminists are descended from Crenshaw's

40:06.380 --> 40:11.220
work, most notably in the online space, Robin DiAngelo and her white fragility nonsense.

40:11.220 --> 40:15.100
But there's tons of people out there who view subversive action against liberal society

40:15.100 --> 40:18.860
as an a priori good and not just in terms of critical race theory.

40:18.860 --> 40:22.560
For example, you can look at critical queer theory and find people talking about how earlier

40:22.560 --> 40:28.180
waves of gay and trans activism were assimilationist in nature because they focused on trying to

40:28.180 --> 40:32.980
make hegemonic culture accept them through things like normalizing gay marriage or appealing

40:32.980 --> 40:36.780
to the stereotypical hyper-femininity of a trans woman, when what they should have been

40:36.780 --> 40:41.660
doing is engaging in the most disruptive, degenerate behaviors imaginable in order to

40:41.660 --> 40:45.020
foster a counterculture that can oppose bourgeois hegemony.

40:45.020 --> 40:48.500
But that is a whole extra can of worms I'm going to have to cover another day.

40:48.500 --> 40:52.620
The point is, critical theory as a movement, as well as the Frankfurt School before it,

40:52.620 --> 40:56.700
view the liberals' attempt to build a neutral space where ideas can be debated and considered

40:56.700 --> 41:01.140
as a weakness that socialists can exploit in order to begin the process of tearing liberalism

41:01.140 --> 41:02.140
down.

41:02.140 --> 41:04.100
And all you have to do is read their writing to see it.

41:04.100 --> 41:05.100
Crenshaw wrote,

41:05.100 --> 41:09.000
Black people can afford it neither to resign themselves to nor to attack frontally the

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
legitimacy and the incoherence of the dominant ideology.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.100
The subordinate position of blacks in this society make it unlikely that African Americans

41:16.100 --> 41:20.300
will realize gains through the kind of direct challenge to the legitimacy of American liberal

41:20.300 --> 41:23.500
ideology that is now being waged by critical scholars.

41:23.500 --> 41:27.780
On the other hand, delegitimating race consciousness would be directly relevant to black needs,

41:27.780 --> 41:32.180
and this strategy will sometimes require the pragmatic use of liberal ideology.

41:32.180 --> 41:35.980
Marcuse said something similar in that long passage earlier from Counter-Revolution and

41:35.980 --> 41:36.980
Revolt that,

41:36.980 --> 41:40.820
The time of the wholesale rejection of the liberals has passed or is not yet to come.

41:40.820 --> 41:44.760
That protests against the war, inflation, and unemployment from a point of view of civil

41:44.760 --> 41:49.720
rights could be tolerated as a tactical deployment of liberal ideals to be used and discarded

41:49.720 --> 41:52.120
later, like how elections are a lesser evil.

41:52.120 --> 41:56.560
Critical theorists use their analytical method to destabilize liberal systems and prime them

41:56.560 --> 41:57.560
for revolution.

41:57.560 --> 42:02.040
They only appeal to liberal values and ethics insofar as it will help them achieve this

42:02.040 --> 42:13.840
goal.

42:13.840 --> 42:17.960
In case it's not yet clear that Sock Dunn Left is talking out of his gaping asshole

42:17.960 --> 42:19.960
for his entire article when he says,

42:19.960 --> 42:23.840
Conservatives are lying and grifting because they claimed Gramsci said something he didn't

42:23.840 --> 42:27.360
say, even though socialists still believe in all of the underlying ethics anyway.

42:27.360 --> 42:31.480
I hope this is the final nail in the coffin regarding any assumptions of good faith in

42:31.480 --> 42:35.120
his part, or at the very least, that he actually reads any of the theory that he cites.

42:35.120 --> 42:38.820
There is a clear lineage from Antonio Gramsci to the present day, and the craziest thing

42:38.820 --> 42:43.520
about it all is, when I took that 2007 class, this stuff wasn't exactly kept secret, but

42:43.560 --> 42:45.240
it wasn't being shouted from the rooftops either.

42:45.240 --> 42:48.840
My professor made it clear that this was very serious, very subversive stuff, and while

42:48.840 --> 42:53.600
it wasn't to be kept under wraps, it was meant to make us critical theorists.

42:53.600 --> 42:57.320
He was clear about viewing his class as a political project, his contribution to the

42:57.320 --> 42:58.320
creation of counter-hegemony.

42:58.320 --> 43:03.200
It's only after my generation, the millennials, left university, entered the workforce, and

43:03.200 --> 43:07.240
began to implement this shit, that wider society began to take notice, and the subversives

43:07.240 --> 43:08.240
began to panic.

43:08.240 --> 43:09.840
Here's one example of what I mean.

43:09.840 --> 43:13.660
If you go to the Wikipedia article on Cultural Marxism, you'll get this passage.

43:13.660 --> 43:18.340
The term Cultural Marxism refers to a far-right anti-Semitic conspiracy theory which claims

43:18.340 --> 43:23.120
that Western Marxism is the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert

43:23.120 --> 43:24.200
Western culture.

43:24.200 --> 43:28.920
The conspiracy theory misrepresents the Frankfurt School as being responsible for modern progressive

43:28.920 --> 43:32.720
movements, identity politics, and political correctness, claiming that there is an ongoing

43:32.720 --> 43:37.420
and intentional subversion of Western society via a planned culture war that undermines

43:37.420 --> 43:41.320
the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism and seeks to replace them with the culturally

43:41.320 --> 43:43.520
liberal values of the 1960s.

43:43.520 --> 43:48.260
Although similarities with the Nazi propaganda term Cultural Bolshevism has been noted, the

43:48.260 --> 43:52.500
contemporary conspiracy theory originated in the United States during the 1990s.

43:52.500 --> 43:56.700
Originally found only on the far-right political fringe, the term began to enter mainstream

43:56.700 --> 43:59.460
discourse in the 2010s and is now found globally.

43:59.460 --> 44:04.060
The conspiracy theory of a Marxist culture war is promoted by right-wing politicians,

44:04.060 --> 44:07.420
fundamentalist religious leaders, political commentators in mainstream print and television

44:07.420 --> 44:12.000
media, and white supremacist terrorists, and has been described as a foundational element

44:12.000 --> 44:13.340
of the alt-right worldview.

44:13.340 --> 44:15.700
Now, to me, this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

44:15.700 --> 44:21.660
In fact, it seems to be an outright lie because my professor, back in 2007, explicitly referred

44:21.660 --> 44:24.220
to what we were talking about as Cultural Marxism.

44:24.220 --> 44:27.520
It was not the name of some false conspiracy theory back then.

44:27.520 --> 44:29.920
It was what underpinned critical theory.

44:29.920 --> 44:33.860
We learned to attack aspects of hegemonic culture, mainly pop culture, let's be honest.

44:33.860 --> 44:38.760
It was an intro-level course, through media criticism meant to deconstruct and demoralize,

44:38.760 --> 44:43.140
with the long-term purpose being the creation of a space where an alternative, and preferably

44:43.140 --> 44:45.100
socialist, counterculture could form.

44:45.100 --> 44:49.260
The Wikipedia article frames this as if it's false and anti-Semitic and only neo-Nazis

44:49.260 --> 44:53.740
believe it or something, but in my experience, this is exactly what it is, and back then

44:53.740 --> 44:56.100
they had no problem just outright saying it.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.740
What's really interesting is, if you look at the Cultural Marxism Wikipedia article

44:59.740 --> 45:02.220
from 2014, it's more or less accurate.

45:02.220 --> 45:06.100
Cultural Marxism is an offshoot of Marxism that conceives of culture as central to the

45:06.100 --> 45:08.880
legitimization of oppression, in addition to economic factors.

45:08.880 --> 45:13.560
An outgrowth of Western Marxism, especially from Antonio Gramsci in the Frankfurt School,

45:13.560 --> 45:17.720
Cultural Marxism argues that what appears as traditional cultural phenomenon intrinsic

45:17.720 --> 45:22.380
to Western society, for instance capitalism, nationalism, the nuclear family, gender roles,

45:22.380 --> 45:26.900
race, and other forms of cultural identity, serve to justify and maintain hierarchy.

45:26.900 --> 45:31.980
Cultural Marxists use Marxist methods to make it possible to criticize what appears natural,

45:31.980 --> 45:32.980
but is in fact ideological.

45:32.980 --> 45:37.180
This is pretty much spot on, all of the writing I've referenced today shows it to be spot

45:37.180 --> 45:38.180
on.

45:38.180 --> 45:39.180
And you know what?

45:39.180 --> 45:43.140
Other lesser known Wikipedia articles still reinforce this too, but the article that everyone's

45:43.140 --> 45:47.020
been searching in the past few years, Cultural Marxism, is the one that's been changed

45:47.020 --> 45:48.580
to try and hide the smoke.

45:48.580 --> 45:53.260
The contents of the old Cultural Marxism page have just been moved to a new heading in Wikipedia

45:53.260 --> 45:55.660
called Marxist Cultural Analysis.

45:55.660 --> 45:59.260
This really is some we're not doing it and it's good that it's happening shit.

45:59.260 --> 46:03.700
On this page, the claim is made that the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory is an influential

46:03.700 --> 46:08.660
discourse in the far right without any clear relationship to Marxist Cultural Analysis.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.740
On the current Cultural Marxism page, a similar claim is made.

46:11.740 --> 46:16.100
Scholarly analysis of the conspiracy theory has concluded that the Cultural Marxism conspiracy

46:16.100 --> 46:18.380
theory has no basis in fact.

46:18.380 --> 46:22.420
Both of these passages cite the article, Who's Afraid of the Frankfurt School?

46:22.420 --> 46:26.580
Cultural Marxism as an Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory, by Joanne Braun from the Journal of

46:26.580 --> 46:27.580
Social Justice.

46:27.780 --> 46:32.300
Okay, now this sounds like some, we've investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong shit

46:32.300 --> 46:33.300
too.

46:33.300 --> 46:35.140
Of course, we should give the devil his due.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.920
I read the article and it's not very good.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.900
The article supports its claim that Cultural Marxism is an antisemitic conspiracy theory

46:41.900 --> 46:46.460
by focusing on three specific proponents of the theory and claiming that because they

46:46.460 --> 46:50.040
are antisemitic, the theory must also be antisemitic.

46:50.040 --> 46:54.180
These three people are Kevin Macdonald, William S. Lind, and Paul Gottfried.

46:54.180 --> 46:56.700
Regarding Kevin Macdonald, Braun is just correct.

46:56.700 --> 46:58.220
He is antisemitic, seemingly to the core.

46:58.220 --> 47:01.700
He's an evolutionary psychology professor, but he's most well known for a trilogy of

47:01.700 --> 47:05.980
books called The Culture of Critique, where he uses his EvoPsych knowledge to claim that

47:05.980 --> 47:10.860
Jews have evolved to undermine the societies in which they live as a form of biologically

47:10.860 --> 47:13.020
fixed extreme in-group preference.

47:13.020 --> 47:15.260
It's safe to say that this guy's a quack.

47:15.260 --> 47:19.180
For William S. Lind, Braun even admits that he doesn't focus his critique of Cultural

47:19.180 --> 47:24.260
Marxism on the Jews, but that his theory does have what she calls antisemitic dimensions.

47:24.260 --> 47:28.140
One of these dimensions she's referring to is his use of the term globalist in his

47:28.140 --> 47:30.020
objections to international capitalism.

47:30.020 --> 47:34.460
Now, I personally don't know what that has to do with the Jews, because when I hear international

47:34.460 --> 47:38.340
capitalists I don't think Jews, and I'm pretty sure that most people who use the word

47:38.340 --> 47:40.900
globalist isn't thinking Jews either.

47:40.900 --> 47:45.460
Nonetheless, Braun did dig up what she calls a Holocaust denial conference from back in

47:45.460 --> 47:50.140
2002, where Lind made the remark that the people in the Frankfurt School were all Jews.

47:50.140 --> 47:53.940
I looked into this event, and it seems to actually have been a paleoconservative conference.

47:53.940 --> 47:57.180
There were definitely some Holocaust snares there, but Lind wasn't one of them, and

47:57.180 --> 47:59.980
he explicitly pointed out that disagreement in his speech.

47:59.980 --> 48:03.780
It may very well be the case that Lind is actually an antisemite, but not once does

48:03.780 --> 48:07.880
Jewishness come up in his discussions of Cultural Marxism, and regardless of his motivations,

48:07.880 --> 48:10.320
his critique is solid and factual.

48:10.320 --> 48:13.340
Regarding Paul Gottfried, Braun's case is the weakest.

48:13.340 --> 48:18.140
She admits that Gottfried is Jewish himself, and studied under Herbert Marcuse in his youth.

48:18.140 --> 48:22.100
The only points she can muster against him are ultimately irrelevant character attacks,

48:22.100 --> 48:26.540
like how he calls himself a paleoconservative, a term that he coined in fact, or how he mentored

48:26.540 --> 48:27.540
Richard Spencer.

48:27.540 --> 48:31.620
And Braun can't even make the emotional weight of that charge stick because she immediately

48:31.620 --> 48:34.880
admits that Spencer is far more extreme than Gottfried.

48:34.880 --> 48:39.340
But most importantly of all, even if all three of these men were vicious antisemites and

48:39.340 --> 48:44.020
open goose-stepping Nazis and all the rest of it, that doesn't make Cultural Marxism

48:44.020 --> 48:48.580
an alt-right antisemitic fascist conspiracy theory, nor does it prove it to be factually

48:48.580 --> 48:49.580
incorrect.

48:49.580 --> 48:54.340
The correct thing is still correct, even if people that you find distasteful believe

48:54.340 --> 48:55.340
it.

48:55.340 --> 48:59.920
Beyond these three men, Braun seems to have no real argument except, bad people believe

48:59.920 --> 49:01.320
this, therefore it's wrong.

49:01.320 --> 49:04.860
She claims that Anders Breivik was influenced by the idea to commit his shooting.

49:04.860 --> 49:08.220
And while that's certainly bad, that doesn't disprove the idea.

49:08.220 --> 49:12.540
She claims that Andrew Breitbart, Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, and Brazilian

49:12.540 --> 49:16.940
President Bolsonaro's son all believe in the theory, and that also doesn't disprove

49:16.940 --> 49:17.940
it.

49:17.940 --> 49:22.020
She also makes a list of very strange claims about Cultural Marxism, including that

49:47.940 --> 49:48.940
you're a Nazi.

49:48.940 --> 49:49.940
3.

49:49.940 --> 49:53.900
It's the source of the view that leftists sometimes engage in pro-pedophile activism,

49:53.900 --> 49:58.600
when according to Braun, this never happens, and it's only ever sex ed in schools and

49:58.600 --> 50:00.000
accepting trans identities.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.500
So if you think it's happening because, you know, you see it, you're a Nazi.

50:03.500 --> 50:06.920
It's really incredible just how much she gaslights the reader here.

50:06.920 --> 50:10.700
The entire foundation of this article is, bad people believe in this idea, therefore

50:10.700 --> 50:12.980
it's false, and if you believe in it, you're bad too.

50:12.980 --> 50:14.600
Which is pretty dogshit reasoning.

50:14.600 --> 50:19.040
If you believe in any of this stuff, and there is proof for it happening at least sometimes,

50:19.040 --> 50:23.260
then you're an alt-right neo-nazi cultural Marxist believer who hates the Jews, because

50:23.260 --> 50:25.960
you believe in, you know, reality.

50:25.960 --> 50:26.960
That's it.

50:26.960 --> 50:28.080
That's the entire crux of her argument.

50:28.080 --> 50:32.580
Joanne Braun is a professor at Gonzaga University in the Department of Leadership Studies.

50:32.580 --> 50:34.980
You can actually get a leadership studies degree.

50:34.980 --> 50:37.880
As far as I can tell, it's all about teaching you how to be a socially conscious middle

50:37.880 --> 50:39.680
manager or HR department head.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.200
Geez, and I thought my degree was worthless.

50:42.200 --> 50:46.100
She is, surprise surprise, another academic descended from the Frankfurt School, and she

50:46.100 --> 50:50.920
focuses specifically on critical hate studies and intersections of religion and socialism.

50:50.920 --> 50:54.280
And normally I would not get into this because it's not relevant, fuck you if you think

50:54.280 --> 50:56.280
I'm dog whistling here, but she's Jewish.

50:56.280 --> 51:00.280
A Jewish intellectual who believes that everybody who disagrees with her politics is a Nazi

51:00.280 --> 51:04.100
isn't somebody you can rely on for having an accurate view of this topic.

51:04.100 --> 51:08.240
Not because she's Jewish, you weirdos, but because she's biased.

51:08.240 --> 51:12.880
Cultural Marxism posits that leftist academics, artists, and activists, guided by Graham Shee's

51:12.880 --> 51:17.340
theory of cultural hegemony, are subverting liberal institutions to create counter-hegemony,

51:17.340 --> 51:20.360
and that their school of thought is the Frankfurt School.

51:20.360 --> 51:24.360
Leftist academics, artists, and activists are not only saying that this is false, despite

51:24.360 --> 51:27.920
the mountains of political writing to the contrary on the topic, but that you're an

51:27.920 --> 51:29.280
anti-Semite if you believe it.

51:29.280 --> 51:33.440
And the primary source justifying this belief that cultural Marxism is not only false, but

51:33.440 --> 51:38.800
inherently anti-Semitic, is a leftist academic, artist, and activist, from the very same Frankfurt

51:38.800 --> 51:43.240
School being critiqued, who serves to benefit, both personally and politically, if everyone

51:43.240 --> 51:46.840
who believes in cultural Marxism is considered a Nazi by the public.

51:46.840 --> 51:51.320
And this is the scholarly source that Wikipedia leans on to make the claim that cultural Marxism

51:51.320 --> 51:52.840
is false and anti-Semitic.

51:52.840 --> 51:57.640
I have never seen a more precise reason as to why people tend to not trust academics

51:57.640 --> 51:59.160
and experts anymore.

51:59.160 --> 52:03.120
Most people, including Braun, claim that cultural Marxism as a conspiracy theory is

52:03.120 --> 52:09.400
a continuation of cultural Bolshevism or Judeo-Bolshevism, which actually was a real anti-Semitic conspiracy

52:09.400 --> 52:14.680
theory in Nazi Germany that accused Jewish intellectuals of using art and music to subvert

52:14.680 --> 52:15.820
German culture.

52:15.820 --> 52:20.040
The Nazis called the works degenerate art and used them to justify censoring speech

52:20.040 --> 52:21.040
and expression.

52:21.040 --> 52:24.880
They believe the revolution in Russia was a Jewish plot, due primarily to the involvement

52:24.880 --> 52:28.780
of Leon Trotsky, a Jewish-Ukrainian socialist revolutionary that we've talked about at

52:28.780 --> 52:30.180
length in this channel before.

52:30.180 --> 52:33.420
The Nazis believed that the Jews were the parasitic element that was destroying the

52:33.420 --> 52:38.140
German working class, and that Soviet Russia was an example of that element's victory.

52:38.140 --> 52:41.500
Judeo-Bolshevism is actually an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.

52:41.500 --> 52:45.640
There is no evidence that Jewish intellectuals specifically used culture to undermine Germany.

52:45.640 --> 52:50.100
There is no evidence that Jewish people were actually parasitizing the German working class.

52:50.100 --> 52:54.420
There is no evidence that Bolsheviks in Russia were the culmination of a Jewish revolutionary

52:54.420 --> 52:55.420
plot.

52:55.420 --> 53:00.220
While Cultural Marxism follows the same basic form, revolutionaries using culture to subvert

53:00.220 --> 53:03.900
hegemony, it has nothing else in common with Judeo-Bolshevism.

53:03.900 --> 53:08.820
Neither Antonio Gramsci nor Giorgi Lukas nor Rudi Duchke were Jewish, and the Jewish origins

53:08.820 --> 53:11.420
of the Frankfurt School have nothing to do with their motivations.

53:11.420 --> 53:15.740
I didn't even mention it until this chapter of the video because it's not relevant.

53:15.740 --> 53:20.780
But most importantly of all, unlike with Judeo-Bolshevism, there is ample amounts of evidence across

53:20.780 --> 53:26.100
many different political theorists, spanning nearly 100 years now, that at least some socialists

53:26.100 --> 53:30.060
view Cultural Marxism, or Gramsciian Socialism, or Critical Theory, or whatever you want to

53:30.060 --> 53:33.300
call it, as a viable path forward for their revolution.

53:33.300 --> 53:37.240
It seems to me that the people who are insisting that all of this stuff is just anti-Semitism,

53:37.240 --> 53:40.960
and that you're a Nazi if you notice it's happening, are simply making a last-ditch

53:40.960 --> 53:47.060
effort to try and preserve their growing counter-hegemony by shaming you into compliance through slander,

53:47.060 --> 53:51.820
justified in their minds by a non-existent connection to a previous anti-Semitic conspiracy

53:51.820 --> 53:55.100
theory that kinda looks similar if you really squint your eyes.

53:55.100 --> 53:59.060
And honestly, if some people are just really triggered by calling it Cultural Marxism due

53:59.060 --> 54:02.900
to this trumped-up connection, fine, call it Western Marxism, call it Marxist Cultural

54:02.900 --> 54:03.900
Critique.

54:03.900 --> 54:07.460
Hell, you can even call it the infinitely more neutral Institutional Capture, since

54:07.460 --> 54:11.740
it's not like socialists are the only people who subvert liberal institutions when they

54:11.740 --> 54:12.740
can.

54:12.740 --> 54:13.740
The label doesn't matter.

54:13.740 --> 54:15.200
What matters is, it's happening.

54:15.200 --> 54:30.040
And as liberals, we need to be aware that it's happening.

54:30.040 --> 54:32.040
And that brings us to the present day.

54:32.040 --> 54:33.100
So let's recap.

54:33.100 --> 54:37.320
Antonio Gramsci's experience with the factory workers' revolt, the Italian Socialist Party's

54:37.320 --> 54:40.800
reluctance to support them, and Mussolini taking advantage of that situation, and winning

54:40.800 --> 54:44.960
the popular support of the Italian working class, led him to develop a theory of bourgeois

54:44.960 --> 54:46.320
cultural hegemony.

54:46.320 --> 54:50.400
The proletariat would never reach class consciousness as long as the bourgeois continued to culturally

54:50.400 --> 54:51.960
educate them against their own interests.

54:51.960 --> 54:55.920
So the job of the socialist revolutionary was to undermine the culture and subversively

54:55.920 --> 54:59.880
create countercultures to make the liberal state weak enough that a direct conflict could

54:59.880 --> 55:00.880
be won.

55:00.880 --> 55:05.200
Though Gramsci's prison notebooks did not actually get published until after his death,

55:05.200 --> 55:10.400
he did share his ideas around Vienna's socialist scene, greatly influencing Georgi Lucas, who

55:10.400 --> 55:12.720
became one of the Frankfurt School's founders.

55:12.720 --> 55:16.080
This ideological strain of Marxism would be called Western Marxism, to differentiate

55:16.080 --> 55:18.200
it from the Soviet-style Eastern Marxism.

55:18.200 --> 55:21.560
Both the members of the Frankfurt School, as well as other French intellectuals not

55:21.560 --> 55:25.220
strictly affiliated with it, were heavily influenced by this idea, and more formally

55:25.220 --> 55:29.680
developed Gramsci's ideas into a theory of subversion by a long march through liberal

55:29.680 --> 55:30.680
institutions.

55:30.680 --> 55:33.280
Academic, cultural, journalistic, legal, all of it.

55:33.280 --> 55:37.220
During the American period of the Frankfurt School, American contributions created critical

55:37.220 --> 55:41.480
legal theory, which originally began as a method of analyzing law, but was rapidly adopted

55:41.480 --> 55:44.040
to cultural analysis, critique, and activism.

55:44.040 --> 55:48.600
The discipline fractured across intersectional lines in the wake of neoconservatism's popularity,

55:48.600 --> 55:52.720
with the most well-known strain today being critical race theory, due to a push to have

55:52.720 --> 55:56.680
it taught in American schools, and a reaction to that attempt by the American right-wing.

55:56.680 --> 56:00.520
But all throughout these transformations and differing theorists, it remains Gramsciian

56:00.520 --> 56:01.800
at its core.

56:01.800 --> 56:06.200
Use critical analysis to expose hegemony's weaknesses, build countercultures to propagandize

56:06.200 --> 56:10.140
the masses, and soften liberal society in preparation for a revolution.

56:10.140 --> 56:13.900
Gramsci probably didn't consider that his theory would be used in the service of American

56:13.900 --> 56:18.560
racial minorities or sexual minorities, but he laid the groundwork that later people would

56:18.560 --> 56:22.180
adopt to establish their own subversive movements.

56:22.180 --> 56:26.000
Understanding all of this will help you properly contextualize a lot of the stuff we see nowadays

56:26.000 --> 56:27.680
on all levels of society.

56:27.680 --> 56:31.780
Look at something large, like diversity hires and quotas, and affirmative action in society's

56:31.780 --> 56:35.840
largest institutions, from schools giving blatant racial privileges to minorities, or

56:35.840 --> 56:38.780
rainbow capitalism in the biggest companies in the world.

56:38.780 --> 56:44.280
Look at something medium-sized, like shitty, forced diversity, inclusion, and equity initiatives

56:44.280 --> 56:48.400
in pop culture and entertainment media, where the quality of the art takes a backseat to

56:48.400 --> 56:52.980
ensuring that minorities always take center stage, and leftist agitators demand that more

56:52.980 --> 56:56.060
cultural properties be ceded to their politics.

56:56.060 --> 57:00.820
Hell, look at something small, like the unending, cancerous fucking discussions about appropriately

57:00.820 --> 57:02.420
platforming problematic people.

57:02.420 --> 57:06.120
On a personal level, I know my friend Stardust recently went through that, where she decided

57:06.120 --> 57:10.160
to talk to Richard Spencer on her stream, and some retard raked her over the coals for

57:10.160 --> 57:14.720
not using her 10,000 sub YouTube channel responsibly by his estimation.

57:14.720 --> 57:19.200
All of these disparate things flow from this source and serve this purpose.

57:19.200 --> 57:24.600
The desire to move the world more leftward, inch by inch, space by space, thought by thought,

57:24.600 --> 57:26.280
that is the primary objective.

57:26.280 --> 57:30.120
The second objective is, for those people in spaces that won't move leftward, or even

57:30.120 --> 57:34.640
just don't care, either demoralizing them until they capitulate, or isolating them until

57:34.640 --> 57:37.960
they radicalize, lose all their support, and become irrelevant.

57:37.960 --> 57:42.120
This is the reason why every single event has to push a leftist agenda or be considered

57:42.120 --> 57:43.120
fascist.

57:43.120 --> 57:46.140
This is the reason why liberals or centrists cannot remain unaligned.

57:46.140 --> 57:51.320
They have to be forced into one of two extremist camps, either to be propagandized as a fellow

57:51.320 --> 57:53.960
subversive, or to be identified as an enemy and destroyed.

57:53.960 --> 57:59.000
Now, none of this means that if, for example, a black person complains about being treated

57:59.000 --> 58:02.880
in a racist way, that that's critical race theory, and it's part of the socialist subversion,

58:02.880 --> 58:07.200
and we need to stamp it out and enforce a strictly racist, pro-white culture or something.

58:07.200 --> 58:11.620
That also doesn't mean that two gay men getting married is inherently advancing the dialectic

58:11.620 --> 58:13.000
towards revolution, either.

58:13.000 --> 58:18.900
The bulwark against this is ultimately liberal, colorblind, value-neutral policies, the very

58:18.900 --> 58:23.880
thing that Kimberle Crenshaw denounced as racist and sexist and right-wing in her writing.

58:23.880 --> 58:28.920
This is why, when they say, you need to give my group special consideration, we need equity,

58:28.920 --> 58:32.060
not equality, you simply need to tell them, no.

58:32.060 --> 58:34.180
This is the roadmap that they want to travel down.

58:34.180 --> 58:38.740
They will appeal to liberal morality and sensibilities to get you to go down that path, but that's

58:38.740 --> 58:39.860
part of the subversion.

58:39.860 --> 58:43.240
And just like that often-misattributed quote from the start of the video, they are looking

58:43.240 --> 58:45.420
to hang you with your own rope.

58:45.420 --> 58:50.460
To be a liberal means to stand by those colorblind, value-neutral policies even as they look to

58:50.460 --> 58:52.440
use your compassion against you.

58:52.440 --> 58:56.520
It means to be tolerant of cultural differences and subcultures, but only to a point.

58:56.520 --> 59:00.700
You are under no moral obligation to foster a revolution against you.

59:00.700 --> 59:04.540
Starting in Gramscian subversive tactics, but from the right-wing, as a lot of dissident

59:04.540 --> 59:08.100
rightists are currently advocating for, we'll certainly swing the pendulum back around,

59:08.100 --> 59:12.340
but we will be faced with the exact same problem, only this time coming from the other direction.

59:12.340 --> 59:15.680
The solution is based in unapologetic liberalism.

59:15.680 --> 59:20.420
Whatever true crises that Gramscians and critical theorists identify with their analysis, liberalism

59:20.420 --> 59:23.420
can fix without their revolutionary prescriptions.

59:23.420 --> 59:25.260
There we go, that's my video on Antonio Gramsci.

59:25.260 --> 59:28.300
I've been talking about doing it for at least a year, but I didn't really start cracking

59:28.300 --> 59:31.100
open the Prison Notebook seriously until summer of 2022.

59:31.100 --> 59:34.940
Also, Sock Dunn Left is either a mid-wit, or more likely, he's a subversive himself

59:34.940 --> 59:37.620
who is saying it's not happening when he desperately wants it to happen.

59:37.620 --> 59:41.140
And speaking of him, I know I'm responding to a Twitter thread that is over a month old,

59:41.140 --> 59:44.360
but you know how the old saying goes, a lie can travel halfway around the world while

59:44.360 --> 59:46.100
the truth is still putting on its shoes.

59:46.100 --> 59:49.980
Yes, I know, that quote is commonly misattributed to Mark Twain, but I think it's fitting

59:49.980 --> 59:54.060
to end this video the way we began it, on a commonly repeated quote that was never actually

59:54.060 --> 59:56.580
said, but its underlying message still remains factual.

59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.540
It doesn't matter though, I don't expect Sock Dunn Left to actually watch this or anything.

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:04.420
He's already moved on to making newer, dumber takes on Twitter that would likely take me

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.720
another month to debunk properly as well.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:10.860
To borrow a phrase, the socialist intellectual ecosystem is broken.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.300
Leftist grifters don't have to care about the truth.
