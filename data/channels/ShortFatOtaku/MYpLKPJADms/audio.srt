1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140
Sometimes, Twitter will drop a beautiful thing into your lap.

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:12,680
A person who is so out of left field, so wrong, he doesn't know how wrong he is.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,480
Okay, that's pretty much everybody on Twitter.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
All the time.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,200
But today I'm talking about this thread by Sokden Left, everybody's favorite Dunning-Kruger

6
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,660
socialist femboy.

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,320
This isn't exactly how I wanted to start my morning, but I've got my coffee ready,

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:35,060
and now is about as good a time as any.

9
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,940
That capturing the culture quote from Gramsci is fake, or why the conservative intellectual

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,280
ecosystem is broken.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,760
If you're a lefty, you've seen this Gramsci quote.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,040
In the new order, socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration

13
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,400
of schools, universities, churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,400
society.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
It's fake.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
You'll find this quote in Gramsci's writings.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,160
It's a bad summary of Gramsci from Wardner 1996, Unholy Alliance, an insane screed about

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,120
how Freemasons control the world.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Why does this matter?

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,880
First, the conservative intellectual ecosystem is broken.

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,400
I counted over 50 uses of this fake quote in major conservative publications by prominent

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
conservatives.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,060
Not one fact-checked it.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,600
Billionaire backers means that rightists don't need to care about truth.

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,660
Rightists claim that leftists seize control of the institutions, and use that to justify

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,100
seizing control back.

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,480
In short, rightist pundits use a fake Gramsci quote created by an anti-Freemason conspiracist

28
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,060
to justify the existence of a secret communist conspiracy, which they use to justify destroying

29
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,420
claimed leftist institutions.

30
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,860
In shorter, the conservative intellectual ecosystem is broken.

31
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,420
Rightist grifters don't have to care about the truth.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,540
Now, just so I'm not accused of being bad faith, Sock Dunn Left did go into detail on

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,440
a substack, which you can check out for yourself if you like.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,040
But having read the whole article myself, I can confirm that the Twitter thread is a

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,400
pretty accurate summary of it.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,760
I can additionally confirm that the information in the article is also mostly accurate, but

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,080
also that Sock Dunn Left misses the point, and it's actually very easy to see where

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,560
he goes off the rails.

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,120
But let's first start by giving credit where credit is due.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,800
He's entirely correct when he says this quotation that conservatives tend to attribute to Gramsci

41
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,120
is mostly false.

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,640
Of these words, socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,960
In the New Order, socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration

44
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,760
of schools, universities, churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
society.

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,400
Only that first line, socialism is the religion that must overwhelm Christianity, were actually

47
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,740
Gramsci's own words.

48
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,400
That passage comes from an article Gramsci wrote in the Italian socialist newspaper Avanti

49
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,120
in 1916, titled Odissia e Fede, or Audacity and Faith.

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,320
Listen, just because my dad's side of the family comes from Italy doesn't mean that

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,040
I know how to pronounce any of this shit.

52
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,420
The context is, Gramsci is publicly responding to the claims of a Christian socialist from

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,380
a different socialist publication, who thinks that socialism should become Christian.

54
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,500
Christian socialists believe that capitalism is rooted in the sin of greed, and that Jesus,

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,600
who lowered himself to the level of the destitute and fed the poor, was a socialist himself.

56
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,360
They also believe that the shared insular economies of monasteries were an ideal socialist

57
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,780
model for the collectivization of private property.

58
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,300
The idea that all humans, despite their earthly differences, are equal under God is an idea

59
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,260
well adapted to socialism.

60
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:22,060
Gramsci's response to the Christian socialist was this.

61
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,140
Socialism is precisely the religion that must kill Christianity.

62
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,340
Religion in the sense that it is also a faith, which has its mystics and practices.

63
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,180
Religion because it has replaced in the consciences to the transcendental God of Catholics.

64
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,700
Trust in man and in his best energies as the only spiritual reality.

65
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,140
Our gospel is modern philosophy, the one that does without the hypothesis of God in the

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,260
vision of the universe.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,700
What only in history lays its foundations.

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:53,060
In other words, socialism must kill Christianity because socialism fulfills a similar function.

69
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,860
As a secular religion, it doesn't deal with the divine, but it does provide an ethical

70
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,060
system and a blueprint of the universe, which are at odds with the Christian one.

71
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,960
For Gramsci, Marx's historical materialist analytical method is how we determine what

72
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,440
we should do next, rather than God's law.

73
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,940
The rest of that incorrect quotation, in the new order socialism will triumph by first

74
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,140
capturing the culture via infiltration of schools, universities, churches, and the media

75
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,860
by transforming the consciousness of society, was never spoken or written by Gramsci.

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:25,500
Sock Dun Left claims that this quote first comes from a 1996 book, Unholy Alliances,

77
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,500
The Secret Plan and the Secret People Working to Destroy America, by James Wardner.

78
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,020
This book, which I admit I haven't read, seems to contain a lot of stuff about the

79
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,780
Freemasons secretly controlling the world from the shadows, and how all elections are

80
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,380
rigged, and how the Catholic Church has been infiltrated, and all that sort of stuff.

81
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,200
Wardner doesn't seem to think that the Jews are behind the new world order, though,

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
which is a bit surprising.

83
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,340
That's the one conspiracy theory he hasn't bought into.

84
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,580
The rest of the quote comes from Wardner paraphrasing Gramsci, and not actually Gramsci's own words.

85
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,280
This happens quite a lot in the internet quoting business, to be honest.

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,580
The famous socialist quote, The last capitalist shall sell us the rope we hang him with, is

87
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,200
attributed online to the writing of both Marx and Stalin, but actually comes from a private

88
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,280
note written by Lenin on a scrap of paper, later repeated by Yuri Anenkov, a Russian artist,

89
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,460
who claimed to have seen it.

90
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,260
Wardner wrote two books on this topic, Unholy Alliances and a second one, The Planned Destruction

91
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,940
of America, which seems to be more of the same, Communists and Freemasons.

92
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,420
There's videos of him talking about this stuff from back in the 90s.

93
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,980
Wardner died in 2016, and would you believe it, he was a Florida man.

94
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,220
In other words, Wardner is rather inconsequential to the story, all things considered.

95
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,540
But this quote, commonly attributed to Gramsci, for the most part, did come from this obscure

96
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,700
Freemason book where the author, whose ideas are more than a little dubious, gave his interpretation

97
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,120
of Gramsci's views.

98
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,140
The question then is, despite Wardner's eccentricities, is this summary of Gramsci's

99
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,140
view accurate?

100
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,220
What did Gramsci himself actually believe?

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,060
Antonio Gramsci was born on the island of Sardinia in the Kingdom of Italy.

102
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,860
He suffered from health problems all his life, due to what modern medicine now believes was

103
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,780
pot disease, which is a form of tuberculosis that can deform the spine.

104
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,100
Gramsci was an uber manlet due to the disease, less than five feet tall as an adult.

105
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,120
But he was intellectually gifted, and he won a scholarship to the University of Turin in

106
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Northern Italy.

107
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,460
In his early years, Gramsci was a proponent of Sardinian nationalism, believing Sardinia's

108
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,980
poverty and mistreatment to be the fault of the central Italian government, which was

109
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,280
focusing its attention on the rapidly industrializing north.

110
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,240
But after attending university, he began to believe that socialism and not nationalism

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,620
would ultimately solve the problems of the Sardinian working class.

112
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,880
While at the University of Turin, Gramsci was influenced by a wide spectrum of ideas.

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,620
From Benedetto Crose, who at the time was one of Italy's most well-respected liberal

114
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,940
thinkers, to Giovanni Gentile, who is most notable for becoming the most prolific philosopher

115
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,140
of fascism.

116
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,460
From 1917, socialist rioting in Turin had led to the arrest of many notable socialists.

117
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,940
This left holes in Turin's socialist scene, which Antonio Gramsci's fierce intellect

118
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,060
allowed him to fill.

119
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,020
He was elected to the Socialist Party's provisional committee, and eventually set

120
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,980
up the newspaper that attracted Lenin's attention.

121
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,980
In English, Lenin viewed Gramsci's group as being the closest faction in the Italian

122
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,820
socialist community that was equivalent to the Bolsheviks of Russia, and granted him

123
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,940
his support at the Third International.

124
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,420
This was due to Gramsci's support of the Italian workers' councils, which had appeared

125
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,340
spontaneously during the general strike of 1919.

126
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,380
Organizations that Gramsci had conceptualized as being like the Soviets in Russia.

127
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,020
These councils are actually quite important in the development of Gramsci's ideas, so

128
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,360
let's talk about them for a bit.

129
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,800
This era of Italian history is known as the Bienno Rosso, or in English, the Two Red Years,

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,220
a period of significant economic and social instability lasting from 1919 to 1920.

131
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,760
As I mentioned in my video, The Three Forms of Fascism, Italy incurred great economic

132
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
costs to mobilize for World War I.

133
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,700
And at the end of the war, when all those soldiers returned home, they discovered that

134
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,080
with their addition to the workforce, there were too many workers and not enough work.

135
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,160
High unemployment and high inflation led to a significant increase in the price of basic

136
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
goods.

137
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,120
Large swathes of Italian society ended up joining various revolutionary groups during

138
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,960
this period, from the Italian Socialist Party, which Gramsci was a member of, to the Italian

139
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,000
Syndicalist Union, which advocated for Italy's entry into the war in the first place, to

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,600
the Italian Fighting League, which was the precursor to Mussolini's black shirts.

141
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,680
This period saw widespread striking among both city laborers and rural peasants, street

142
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,420
violence, and eventually workers seizing factories with force after their owners tried to lock

143
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,420
them out.

144
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,900
These workers created the Italian worker councils that Gramsci viewed as being the equivalent

145
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,360
of Italian Soviets.

146
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,180
But the rest of the Italian Socialist Party didn't agree.

147
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,100
According to William Peltz's book on the period, Against Capitalism, the workers' councils

148
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,220
didn't just want to negotiate with the owners of the factories, they wanted to control the

149
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,900
factories directly with the council structure taking the place of the owners, a demand that

150
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,620
despite Gramsci's support, the Italian Socialist Party did not endorse.

151
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,480
By 1921, the economy had become so disrupted and unproductive that the Italian working

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,360
class was hit with mass layoffs and wage cuts.

153
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,240
The workers' councils fell apart, and a lot of the people who supported them, feeling

154
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,200
betrayed by the lack of direct action on the part of the Italian Socialist Party, would

155
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,520
end up joining the Italian Fighting League and following Mussolini instead, as during

156
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,320
this same period, they had proven themselves more than capable of engaging in direct violence

157
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
against the liberal state.

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,600
In fact, while Mussolini's initial backers were Italian veterans of the First World War,

159
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,780
his first huge upswell of popular grassroots support were primarily farmers, factory workers,

160
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,180
and middle-class laborers who were fed up with the Italian Socialist Party's all-talk,

161
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,300
no-action reputation when it came to revolutionary action.

162
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,340
It was the influence of these workers' councils that partially led Mussolini to adopt George

163
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,900
Sorel's National Syndicalism philosophy when he began to conceptualize a more coherent

164
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,340
fascist ideology.

165
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,260
For Antonio Gramsci, all of this meant that he believed he was ultimately correct about

166
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,460
the revolutionary potential of the factory workers' councils, and that the Italian

167
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:56,400
Socialist Party had missed a vital chance to secure a revolution, something that Mussolini

168
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,660
had taken advantage of.

169
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,560
This was not the only split between Gramsci and the rest of the Italian Socialist Party.

170
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,320
The militant group are diti del popo, or the people's daring ones.

171
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,220
Socialist thugs, who were tasked with confronting Mussolini's equally thuggish blackshirts

172
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,080
in the streets, was denounced by the Italian Socialist Party, but supported by Gramsci

173
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,440
and Lenin as proletarian violence against fascism.

174
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,940
By 1922, Gramsci was called to Moscow to receive official Russian support.

175
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,980
It was here that he would meet his wife, with whom he had two sons.

176
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,420
Gramsci would never see his youngest.

177
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,560
Lenin instructed Gramsci to return to Italy, take leadership of the Italian Socialist Party,

178
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,280
unite Italy's leftists, and provide a bulwark against fascism.

179
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,820
While Gramsci was out of the country, Mussolini purged many of the leaders of the Italian

180
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,180
Socialist Party, making Gramsci's task of taking control a lot easier when he returned.

181
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,780
However, Gramsci made little progress in uniting Italy's left, because Mussolini's fascism

182
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,860
proved to be significantly more popular among the working class.

183
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,720
The revolutionary fervor of the proletariat against the liberal state was fulfilled through

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,840
Mussolini's embracing of street violence, while the property and profit of the bourgeois

185
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,200
was tentatively respected as long as they followed the direction of the fascists through

186
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,120
the national syndicalist model Mussolini had imposed on them.

187
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,600
It's no surprise to me that Mussolini was able to attract so many socialists, anarchists,

188
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,300
and working class members to the fledgling fascism, despite their obvious differences.

189
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,760
George Sorel famously stated that Mussolini's blending of the national and the social had

190
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,360
made fascism a completely new philosophy outside of the understanding of the socialist dialectic,

191
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,100
and that Mussolini was solving the contradictions of capitalism by destroying both the proletariat

192
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:31,640
and the bourgeois as distinct classes, leaving only the state and its organs in their place.

193
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,260
The popular view of fascism in its day was that it was the next political step of progress

194
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,800
beyond socialism, a notion among Italy's working class that Antonio Gramsci failed

195
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,780
to shake with his own activism.

196
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,280
By September 11, 1926, Gino Lucetti, an anarchist with the People's Daring Ones, attempted

197
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,580
to assassinate Mussolini by throwing a bomb at his limo during a public appearance.

198
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,540
This attempt on his life, along with others in the same year, led to the abolishment of

199
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,740
the Italian Socialist Party and the creation of OVRA, the Organization for Vigilance and

200
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,060
Repression of Anti-Fascism, the fascist secret police in Italy.

201
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,120
All Italian Socialist Party members, including Gramsci, were rounded up and imprisoned.

202
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,960
There is some evidence that the fascists staged at least a few of the attacks on Mussolini's

203
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,060
life as a pretense for gaining power, but the Lucetti bomb-throwing event is firmly

204
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,980
established as not a false flag, but a real assassination attempt.

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,480
In any case, it gave Mussolini the justification to finally wash away the last remnants of

206
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,000
the old parliamentary democracy, and Gramsci, as the last remaining nexus of fascist resistance,

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,300
was washed away along with it.

208
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:52,720
The fascist recognized that Gramsci posed a significant threat to their movement due

209
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
to his intellect.

210
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:00,000
His prosecutor at trial famously stated, for 20 years, we must stop this brain from functioning.

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,780
Gramsci survived 11 years behind bars, before finally dying at the age of 46.

212
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,280
What killed him is debated.

213
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:10,240
While there is no doubt that the fascists treated him exceptionally poorly behind bars,

214
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,640
his situation was also exacerbated by his lifelong poor health.

215
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:18,000
One of the forewords of the Prison Notebooks states that Mussolini moved Gramsci from prison

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,960
to the hospital near the end of his life to make it look like he died of natural causes,

217
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,040
a gambit that ultimately didn't work.

218
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,180
And I guess that's as good a time as any to start talking about the Prison Notebooks.

219
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:31,600
The Prison Notebooks are the most influential pieces of socialist theory that Antonio Gramsci

220
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
contributed to the movement.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,520
They are a disorganized and often unfinished collection of essays, spread out across 33

222
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,640
notebooks, written entirely while under fascist guard.

223
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,360
Gramsci spent his 11 years behind bars, alternating between a jail cell, a doctor's office, and

224
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,080
eventually due to his declining health and international outcry, in exile where he was

225
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,280
permitted to go on short walks and was given magazines to read.

226
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,540
This wasn't really freedom, though, as his walks were monitored by the fascists, all

227
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,180
of his reading materials were pre-screened, and his letters to his family were read before

228
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,160
they were delivered by Gramsci's sister-in-law.

229
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,280
As a result, Gramsci had to be careful about what he wrote, as the fascist guards could

230
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,860
at any time decide to read what he was up to, and they occasionally did.

231
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,520
So Gramsci had to couch his language using more generalized terms.

232
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,280
For example, Gramsci tends to use the phrase dominant group when talking about the bourgeois.

233
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,560
The socialists have a language of their own in a sense, with terms like bourgeois, proletariat,

234
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,040
means of production, and Gramsci avoided using them as much as possible.

235
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,520
The Prison Notebooks were published with each essay being introduced by either Quentin Hoare

236
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:33,520
or Geoffrey Noel Smith, the translators, each offering their own interpretation of

237
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
the writing.

238
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,440
Therefore, in order to avoid censorship by his fascist jailers, a lot of Gramsci's

239
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,640
writing in the Prison Notebooks is indirect.

240
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,640
In fact, the most famous example of this is that meme that began Sock Dunn-Leff's Twitter

241
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
thread.

242
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,880
The quote being referenced here in this image of Bart and Homer is another of Gramsci's

243
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
most famous lines.

244
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,000
The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born.

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,440
Now is the time of monsters.

246
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,860
I can see why it became a quote, it's quite poetic and evocative, and sometimes people

247
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,580
use it to try to draw links between Gramsci and Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister.

248
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,820
By pointing out that Goebbels said in 1939, we know today the old world is dying and we

249
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,620
are seeing the struggle for a new world.

250
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,880
But there's no link here.

251
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,180
Before the Prison Notebooks were published, nobody outside of Gramsci, his friends who

252
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,500
smuggled them out, and the low-level fascist guards who read them even knew of their existence.

253
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,040
It's much more likely that because fascism and socialism are both modernist ideologies

254
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,800
interested in revolution and rebirth, the wiping clean of old orders, and the construction

255
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,120
of a new society, a new man, Gramsci and Goebbels appealed to the same sentiments out

256
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,220
of coincidence.

257
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,760
The original form of Gramsci's monsters quote is, the crisis consists precisely in

258
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,800
the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.

259
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,580
In this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.

260
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,360
What are these morbid symptoms?

261
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
Gramsci doesn't really say.

262
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,200
The next sentence reads, this paragraph should be completed by some observations which I

263
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,860
made on the so-called problem of the younger generation.

264
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,300
Like I said, a lot of these essays went unfinished.

265
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,600
So what did he mean by morbid symptoms?

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,720
Some people think that Gramsci meant the emergence of fascism in the face of revolutionary worker

267
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,100
fervor and the failure of the Italian Socialist Party in, uh, capitalizing on the opportunity.

268
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,020
However, other people think that he meant the Italian Socialist Party's ultra-left-wing

269
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,040
turn at the Third International, abandoning their liberal and social democratic allies

270
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,540
at Lenin's encouragement, under the misguided belief that fascism was going to collapse

271
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,040
all on its own within months.

272
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,260
There's no clear answer here.

273
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,120
The point I'm getting at is, in actually examining the content of the Prison Notebooks,

274
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,620
you have to read between the lines a bit more than you might otherwise.

275
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,420
Gramsci's not going to come out and say what he's advocating, the way that Karl Marx

276
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,420
did in the Communist Manifesto.

277
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,500
And I know that Sock Dunleff's whole argument hinges on, but Gramsci didn't specifically

278
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
say that.

279
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
But come on, you're a socialist.

280
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,480
You're used to hearing dog whistles everywhere, from edgy jokes about the Holocaust, to stone

281
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,100
toss comics, to gamer words.

282
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,660
Hell, you even made an entire other article about dog whistling, what it is, how to spot

283
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
it, why it's bad.

284
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,700
Oh, except you don't think it's bad, as long as your side is the one doing it, of

285
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
course.

286
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,000
If you're just straining yourself to read between the lines so hard that you think people

287
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
like Sargon, or hell, even somebody as milquetoast as Tim Pool are fascists, then you can read

288
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,180
between the lines a little bit for Antonio Gramsci as well.

289
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,160
When Sock Dunleff said, correctly, that the quote conservatives throw around was a false

290
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,720
one, I replied on Twitter with,

291
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,440
It's true this quote is fake, but the idea behind it is absolutely Gramsciant, despite

292
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,880
what SDL claims.

293
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,400
The section, The Formation of the Intellectuals, from the Prison Notebooks, outlines Gramsci's

294
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,960
call for socialists to subvert morality-creating cultural institutions.

295
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
He replied to me with,

296
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,960
Provide a quotation!

297
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,080
In that essay, which is mostly descriptive with few prescriptions, Gramsci says nothing

298
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,080
like that.

299
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,900
He then cites the summary of the essay provided by the translator, which basically says that

300
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,420
the working class can organically create its own intellectual to counter the bourgeois

301
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,820
intellectual, provide their own ideas outside of bourgeois control, and begin to build counter-hegemony.

302
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,380
He then cites Gramsci describing his own newspaper's goal of creating that new type of working

303
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,180
class intellectual, even highlighting this passage.

304
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:54,020
One of the most important characteristics of any group that is developing towards dominance

305
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,660
is its struggle to assimilate and to conquer ideologically the traditional intellectuals.

306
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,440
But this assimilation and conquest is made quicker and more efficacious the more the

307
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,140
group in question succeeds in simultaneously elaborating its own organic intellectuals.

308
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,360
Now, I don't know why Sock Dunleff thought this was an own.

309
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,380
Gramsci is describing a portion of Lenin's dual power theory here, where socialists should

310
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,340
build up working class alternatives to the various components of bourgeois society.

311
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,660
Gramsci is only talking about intellectuals, but Lenin applied dual power theory to all

312
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,260
of society's institutions, so that these alternatives are ready to go when bourgeois

313
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,020
society falls to the revolution.

314
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,740
In this quote, Gramsci is describing how a dominant group maintains ideological control

315
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,260
over society using their intellectuals, and so a subversive group has to create their

316
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,060
own intellectuals with their own ideas as part of countering the effect.

317
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,460
Sock Dunleff is technically correct when he says that even though Gramsci describes what's

318
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,980
going on here, he doesn't take the final step and explicitly come out and say that's

319
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,620
what socialists should do.

320
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,500
For example, at the beginning of the essay, he writes,

321
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,740
The capitalist entrepreneur creates alongside himself the industrial technician, the specialist

322
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,500
in political economy, the organizers of a new culture, of a new legal system, etc.

323
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,980
He doesn't end the statement with, And we should build up our own counters to do this,

324
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,620
because, um, remember the fascist guards looking over his shoulder?

325
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,300
The Prison Notebooks mainly consists of detailed insights into how, in Gramsci's view, the

326
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,740
bourgeois delicately controlled the various knobs and levers of society to keep themselves

327
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
in power.

328
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,980
It is only due to circumstance that he was required to leave the final step of the revolutionary

329
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:28,620
process, the call to act on this understanding, in the hands of the reader.

330
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:33,020
The main contribution that Antonio Gramsci made to socialist theory in The Prison Notebooks

331
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,200
is the concept of cultural hegemony.

332
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,700
Is it hegemony or hegemony?

333
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,140
I'll use hegemony.

334
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,560
Marxian socialism had a predictive element to it, that the socialist revolution would

335
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,540
inevitably happen, just as feudalism had collapsed into capitalism before it, as a

336
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,700
natural part of the march of progress.

337
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,840
By the early 20th century, it was widely adopted by socialists that Marx was wrong about this.

338
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Socialism split into a number of post-Marxist schools of thought.

339
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,320
One that we've spoken about extensively on this channel was Sorelianism, where George

340
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,820
Sorel planted the seeds for fascism through his belief that a revolution against international

341
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,160
capital had to be a nationalist one.

342
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,180
Leninism, meanwhile, consists of Lenin's belief that a group of socialist intellectuals,

343
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:14,320
known as the vanguard, had to control the state and reeducate the people with the proper

344
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,900
political consciousness before any true socialism could appear.

345
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,000
Gramsci in thought, however, is different.

346
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,740
Gramsci believed that the reason the workers did not revolt against the bourgeois, as Marx

347
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,380
had predicted, is because they were subsumed in bourgeois culture.

348
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,460
The bourgeois propagated its own values into the minds of the proletariat in the form of

349
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:35,900
what we call common sense, making them act out cultural values that were against their

350
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,500
own material interests.

351
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,500
A simplistic example is, you might be told as a child that stealing from a shop is immoral

352
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,780
for a number of reasons, religious, economic.

353
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,200
But Gramscians would argue that it's only immoral because the bourgeois wants you to

354
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,160
think it's immoral, because they have something to gain if you don't steal.

355
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:55,660
In this view, all of the values of a capitalist society serve to prevent a workers' revolution,

356
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,140
while the society in question presents those values as normal or natural or obvious when

357
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,420
they are in fact imposed.

358
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,380
Gramsci identified the two halves that propagate this bourgeois culture, using two different

359
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,380
methods.

360
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,120
The first he called political society, the police, the army, the legal system, the government.

361
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,420
These institutions spread bourgeois culture through force.

362
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,040
These are the components of society that will come for you if you don't accept and live

363
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,620
by bourgeois culture.

364
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,900
The second he called civil society, the family, the schools, the churches, the unions, the

365
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
media.

366
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,060
These institutions don't use force, but they secure consent from the people through a combination

367
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,020
of incentives and social pressures.

368
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,180
In this way, the people spread the same bourgeois culture to each other that prevents them from

369
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,980
revolting against capitalism.

370
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,540
Gramsci believed that working class intellectuals, separate from the traditional intellectuals

371
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,960
of bourgeois society, needed to develop an entirely separate value system and ideology

372
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,020
in order to be able to combat the cultural hegemony the bourgeois held over society.

373
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:52,180
This development of an alternative morality and culture to challenge bourgeois hegemony

374
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,380
is what Gramsci called the War of Position, contrasted with the War of Maneuver, which

375
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,700
is a direct revolution.

376
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,020
Gramsci theorized that in Russia, a war of position to dismantle bourgeois hegemony was

377
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,940
not necessary before a war of maneuver could take place, because Russia's bourgeois had

378
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,040
never actually achieved any hegemony.

379
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,000
This was not the case in more industrialized, centralized, and urbanized states, making

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,840
the development of alternative culture and morality a necessity before any direct revolution

381
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,180
could be successful.

382
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,980
Gramsci specifically described this process with the word subversive, and how even peasants

383
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:27,140
who had not yet fostered any class consciousness were still reflexively subversive when encountering

384
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,380
civil servants working for the modern state.

385
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,700
These peasants didn't have the education to understand the modern state, but they did

386
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,620
intuitively know that the local civil servant who came around was not somebody to be trusted.

387
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,660
This instinctive reflex was, for Gramsci, indicative of the underlying desire for the

388
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,260
working class to be free of bourgeois hegemony.

389
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,700
In one of his newspaper articles, Gramsci also chided Mussolini for claiming that the

390
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,820
latter could ever be considered truly subversive.

391
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,300
From a modern perspective, that's actually quite strange, listening to socialists and

392
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,700
fascists argue over who the true subversive is, wanting to claim the label because it's

393
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,700
considered positive.

394
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:02,000
Nowadays, both of them try desperately to ditch the title, and claim that the other

395
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,040
is the one who's lying constantly.

396
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,580
Here's where we get to what is, for me personally, the really interesting bit.

397
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,200
In the Twitter thread, Sock Done Left claims that the conservative intellectual ecosystem

398
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,580
is broken, that all of these right-wing creators and talking heads are using this false Gramsci

399
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,520
quote to spread the idea that socialists have the goal of infiltrating institutions to turn

400
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,840
the culture socialist as a prelude to a revolution, the war of position before the war of maneuver,

401
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,080
and that this is the justification the right is leaning on to seize the institutions back.

402
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,520
And where Sock Done Left is correct is not only that the Gramsci quote is false, but

403
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,800
also that Gramsci never explicitly said, seized the institutions and cultural production and

404
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,600
turned them socialist, again due to the fact that he was writing in a fascist prison.

405
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,040
Most of the prison notebooks are descriptions, not prescriptions.

406
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,420
It's Gramsci outlining what he sees the bourgeois doing to establish cultural hegemony,

407
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,240
and what working-class intellectuals could do to create counter-hegemony.

408
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,160
He never actually says, do it, just like a person who doxxes somebody never actually

409
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,080
says go harass them, but we can read between the lines.

410
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,240
But Gramsci did make some overt prescriptions that slipped by the censors.

411
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,320
The most important one was that although the working-class intellectuals were tasked

412
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,180
with the creation of a new type of education, morality, and culture, they were actually

413
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,400
not instructed to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat

414
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,060
as a set of foreign notions, but instead they were to co-opt existing intellectual activities

415
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,880
of the working class and make them inherently critical of the status quo.

416
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,720
It's possible that Gramsci did not advocate for direct Marxist education out of fear of

417
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,960
the censors, hoping that any future comrades would also be able to read between the lines.

418
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,440
But it's also possible that Gramsci did not believe that direct propagandizing would

419
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,880
be effective, that a true awakening of class consciousness would require dismantling bourgeois

420
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,240
hegemony first, and letting the working-class's natural subversiveness blossom all on its

421
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
own.

422
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,640
But all of this is a far cry from saying that the rightoids of today are lying grifters

423
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,140
who don't care about the truth, that their intellectual ecosystem is broken.

424
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,360
Sock Dunn Left explicitly states in the thread that rightist pundits use a fake Gramsci quote

425
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,280
to justify the existence of a secret communist conspiracy, but then in his article he says

426
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,160
that Gramsci and those socialists descended from him argued for socialists attempting

427
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,720
to construct dual power structures to win the coercion battle along with gradually moving

428
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,560
culture production leftward to win the consent battle.

429
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:17,640
Sock Dunn Left literally says right here that what the right wing says Gramsci believed

430
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,680
in that fake quote is actually what Gramsci believed.

431
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,040
Conservatives love to trot out these quotes in order to suggest that leftists are engaged

432
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,920
in a grand conspiracy to take over institutions from within.

433
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,440
Yeah, but that's true though.

434
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Gramsci wrote it.

435
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,480
You even say in your article that you actually want there to be a secret cabal of leftists

436
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
controlling everything.

437
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,840
Leftists are engaged in a conspiracy to take over institutions from within.

438
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,400
They may not be as effective as you want them to be, or as the right says that they are,

439
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,320
but putting aside the effectiveness, does the effort exist?

440
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,200
The only possible answer to that is yes.

441
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,360
Lots of people who talk about critical race theory online have no idea what it is.

442
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,800
Those few people who have read the writings of critical theorists, however, all report

443
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,960
that they are directly descended from Gramscian socialism.

444
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,400
Sargon did something like 10 videos going over the various components of the critical

445
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,880
race theory bible, and those are worthwhile videos to watch for sure.

446
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,560
But I found personally that when I was watching them I wasn't actually learning very much

447
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,680
— sorry Sargon — I was instead remembering it.

448
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,000
Because for me, this is all stuff that I had already personally encountered and kind

449
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
of forgotten about.

450
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,280
In the first year university course, Introduction to Critical Theory, that I took back in 2007.

451
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,240
Here's my textbook from that class, Critical Theory Today by Lois Tyson, second edition,

452
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,160
though I understand there's been several newer versions of the book since I've graduated.

453
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,400
Let's trace the genealogy of the post-Gramscian socialist movement.

454
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,640
The Hungarian thinker Georgi Lukas is one of the most influential philosophers of what

455
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,500
would eventually become critical theory.

456
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,080
He had a similar intellectual development as Antonio Gramsci.

457
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,580
He went off to university and discovered the philosophies of Marx, Sorel, Hegel, Kierkegaard,

458
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
and Gentile.

459
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:59,120
The Russian Revolution of 1917 inspired him to become a committed Marxist, and though

460
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,040
he was somewhat critical of Leninism, he nonetheless became a commissar in the short-lived 1919

461
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,760
Hungarian Soviet Republic and committed atrocities you'd expect from that station.

462
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,160
After that state was crushed in the Hungarian Civil War, Lukas fled to Italy.

463
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,560
Gramsci and Lukas were in Vienna at the same time in the 1920s, and though they never met,

464
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,120
Gramsci's ideas were introduced to Lukas through a mutual comrade, the Belgian-Russian

465
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,160
anarchist Victor Serge, who really has nothing to his name other than getting Gramsci's

466
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
ideas out there.

467
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:30,560
Serge moved back to Russia, opposed Lenin, was exiled, and died.

468
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,920
Lukas traveled to the Soviet Union in 1933 to take up a spot in a Moscow university and

469
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:38,920
was not allowed to leave, first due to the outbreak of the Second World War and, secondly,

470
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,960
due to being exiled in Stalin's Great Purge.

471
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,600
By the time he returned to Hungary in 1945, it was again a Soviet state, and he joined

472
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,740
the Hungarian Communist Party, taking on an administrative role.

473
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,500
Though Lukas was ultimately critical of Stalin and the Soviet regimes of Eastern Europe as

474
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,600
not being true socialism, he kept those beliefs under wraps until after Stalin's death.

475
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,960
He spent his remaining years advocating for socialism, but critical of its current form.

476
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,260
Georgi Lukas contributed a lot to political theory and history, I've only just skimmed

477
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,320
over his biography, but what concerns us today is his involvement in the Frankfurt School.

478
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,560
The Frankfurt School began as a physical school, the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt.

479
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,120
But it eventually became a school of thought.

480
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,000
Lukas was one of the school's founders and published a work that is just as influential

481
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,760
as Gramsci's prison notebooks, History and Class Consciousness.

482
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,240
In this book, Lukas argues that Marxism is not only a theory of political economy that

483
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,400
improves upon its bourgeois predecessors by advancing the dialectic, nor is it only a

484
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,040
scientific sociology like the natural sciences, but it is also a critique, a self-conscious

485
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,780
transformation of society.

486
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:44,680
The old Marxist purists argued that Marxism made philosophy obsolete.

487
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:49,480
But these new Marxists, commonly called Western Marxists like Lukas and Gramsci, claimed that

488
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,000
Marxism preserves the truths of philosophy until revolution can transform them into reality.

489
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,900
This process was explored by Marx, but was popularized by Lukas using the term reification.

490
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,380
To reify something means to take something that is abstract and make it a real object.

491
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:09,060
To use a modern comparison, what objectification is to people, reification is to ideas.

492
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,460
The Frankfurt School was heavily influenced by the rise of fascism in Europe in two ways.

493
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,880
First, the intellectuals of the school applied their interpretations of Marxist political

494
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,580
theory to try and explain why fascism, and not socialism, had been the result of widespread

495
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,060
working-class revolt.

496
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,820
Secondly, when Germany became too unsafe for them to continue their work as the Nazis rose

497
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,460
to power, the school was moved to the United States, along with most of its members, though

498
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,100
Georgi Lukas was a notable exception who remained behind in Europe.

499
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,540
Everyone actually involved in the Frankfurt School is notable enough that they each deserve

500
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,380
a video in their own right, especially Herbert Marcuse, another person Sargon's covered

501
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:45,260
over at the Lotus Eaters, and there just isn't enough time to talk about them all right now.

502
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,060
But the leader of the Frankfurt School in America, the German sociologist Max Horkheimer,

503
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,740
wrote in his 1937 work, Traditional and Critical Theory, that critical theory as an intellectual

504
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:59,420
tradition was a social critique meant to affect political change and foster intellectual enlightenment,

505
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,780
an idea that is likely descended from Gramsci through Lukas.

506
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,200
Meanwhile, the Frankfurt School had influenced a community of French intellectuals who, while

507
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,960
not a part of the school, were still Western Marxists and critical theorists.

508
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,760
Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist, his partner Simone de Beauvoir, who pretty

509
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:19,400
much kickstarted feminism's second wave, with her 1949 book, The Second Sex, Jacques Derrida,

510
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,340
who developed the philosophy of deconstruction, Michael Foucault, probably the most famous

511
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,720
postmodernist of all time.

512
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,320
Again, I've got a lot to say about each of these people, and now is not the time, but

513
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,800
even a cursory glance will recognize the Gramsci-ian influence in their philosophy.

514
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,820
They all, in their own way, advocated for the critiquing of society through its institutions

515
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,600
to subvert hegemonic culture and create space for change.

516
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,480
Probably the most blatant Gramsci-ian activist of this period was Rudi Duchké, which is

517
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,820
ironic because Duchké never actually mentioned Gramsci at all, in any of his writing, but

518
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,900
like everyone else, during his time at university, he was heavily influenced by pretty much everyone

519
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,900
I just listed.

520
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,540
All the thinkers of the Frankfurt School, all the French critical theorists, Georgi

521
00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:01,020
Lukas and Mao Zedong and Lenin, and it's in Duchké's ideas that things really begin

522
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,020
to take shape.

523
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,740
Duchké coined the phrase, the long march through the institutions, to describe the

524
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,860
necessity for socialist revolutionaries to subvert capitalist domination of society

525
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,620
by taking up positions from within these institutions and slowly turning them towards socialism.

526
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,340
By the way, even as Sokhton Left said that conservatives were grifters for thinking that

527
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:22,620
this was a socialist goal, he cited Duchké in the article saying that this was his goal.

528
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:26,660
It is unreal how these people will piss on your face and tell you it's raining.

529
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,420
Duchké took the phrase, long march through the institutions, from Mao Zedong's Long

530
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,100
March, which was a strategic retreat that the Chinese Red Army undertook in order to

531
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,460
evade the pursuit of the Chinese nationalists.

532
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,300
It was a grueling event in the Chinese Communist Party's history, covering over 9,000 kilometers

533
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:45,340
across 370 days through the toughest terrain of Western China.

534
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,120
And by the end of it, Mao Zedong had been cemented in the minds of the Chinese Communists

535
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,820
as their undisputed leader.

536
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,300
Duchké's use of the phrase, long march, was meant to evoke the idea of a protracted,

537
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,060
bitter struggle against capitalist forces seeking them out, and how evasion and subversion

538
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,920
across a large enough time frame would lead to a prestigious victory.

539
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,160
Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School explicitly supported Rudi Duchké's idea of a long

540
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,680
march through the institutions, writing in a counter-revolution and revolt, working against

541
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,080
the established institutions while working within them, but not simply by boring from

542
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,440
within, rather by doing the job, learning how to program and read computers, how to

543
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,720
teach at all levels of education, how to use mass media, how to organize production, how

544
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,800
to design, etc., and at the same time preserving one's own consciousness in working with

545
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,800
others.

546
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,000
This march includes the concentrated effort to build up counter-institutions.

547
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,300
They have long been an aim of the movement, but the lack of funds was greatly responsible

548
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,520
for their weakness and their inferior quality.

549
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,080
They must be made competitive.

550
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,320
This is especially important for the development of radical free media.

551
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,880
The fact that the radical left has no equal access to the great chains of information

552
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,240
and indoctrination is largely responsible for its isolation.

553
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,200
Similarly with the development of independent schools and free universities.

554
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,520
They can be competitive, that is to say apt to counteract establishment education, only

555
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:07,040
where they fill a vacuum of where their quality is not only different but also superior.

556
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,240
The collection of large funds for the operation of effective counter-institutions requires

557
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
compromises.

558
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,780
The time of the wholesale rejection of the liberals has passed, or has not yet come.

559
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,820
Radicalism has much to gain from the legitimate protest against the war, inflation, unemployment,

560
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,240
from the defense of civil rights, even perhaps from a lesser evil in local elections.

561
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,360
The ground for the building of a united front is shifting and sometimes dirty, but it is

562
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
there.

563
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,400
I have stressed the key role which the universities play in the present period.

564
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,120
They can still function as institutions for the training of counter-cadres.

565
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,540
The restructuring necessary for the attainment of this goal means more than decisive student

566
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,280
participation and non-authoritarian learning.

567
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,440
Though Dutschke had no knowledge of Gramsci, Marcuse certainly did due to his involvement

568
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,520
in the Frankfurt School.

569
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,920
And though Dutschke would ultimately have little effect on any socialist movement, suffering

570
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:57,240
from a seizure while in the bath and drowning at the age of 39, Marcuse would adopt the

571
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,540
long march through the institutions into his own work and carry it forward with the rest

572
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:15,880
of the Frankfurt School.

573
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:20,040
In the book The Critical Turn in Education, from Marxist critique to post-structuralist

574
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,080
feminism to critical theories of race, it's described that the Frankfurt School entered

575
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,080
into a period of decline correlated with neo-conservatives becoming the dominant American rightist faction,

576
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:34,280
beating out paleoconservatives and libertarians in the right-wing civil war of the late 1970s.

577
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,240
As a result, critical theory as a discipline began to slowly fracture into separate strains

578
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,720
over the years.

579
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:43,480
Postcolonial theory, queer theory, feminist theory, and most famously, at least in modern

580
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,880
terms, critical race theory.

581
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,880
I was lucky.

582
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,600
My textbook included a section on all of them.

583
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,640
Yes, critical race theory is one of the right-wing's current boogeymen, though the trans stuff

584
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,920
seems to be currently overtaking it for the top spot.

585
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,520
And before you ask, yes, there is a form of critical trans theory too.

586
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
It's included in queer theory.

587
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,340
And honestly, all of these different branches function pretty much exactly the same way.

588
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,920
And they can all have their lineage traced back through the Frankfurt School, to Herbert

589
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Marcuse, to Max Horkheimer, to Georgi Lucas, to Antonio Gramsci.

590
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,280
The core Gramsciian idea still remains in critical theory.

591
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,220
In order to subvert bourgeois hegemony, you must construct counter-hegemony.

592
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,220
This means subversive intellectuals who create alternative morality and produce alternative

593
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,520
cultural output.

594
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,020
These would form into organic-appearing countercultures that would drum up revolutionary fervor in

595
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,940
the mind of the normal working-class person.

596
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:32,620
And even if it didn't, it would leave them highly critical of their own society and weak

597
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,620
to further propaganda.

598
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,560
It's pretty much the same thing that Yuri Bezmenov described the Soviet Union doing

599
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,740
through infiltration of Western academia, but with one big difference.

600
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:45,100
The Soviet active measures program was designed to demoralize an enemy population with planted

601
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
agents.

602
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,740
The critical theorists, meanwhile, weren't planted by the Soviets.

603
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,420
They engage in subversive action in the hope of fostering a homegrown revolution not beholden

604
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,060
to foreign socialists.

605
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,300
This book is Critical Race Theory, the key writings that form the movement.

606
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,980
It's a long, boring, arcane tome that I am certain most conservatives have never even

607
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,780
read despite constantly citing this movement.

608
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,780
But it is important.

609
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,020
It's a collection of essays compiled by Kimberle Crenshaw, a civil rights advocate

610
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,820
and the creator of what we now know as intersectional theory.

611
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,820
She coined the term intersectionality in 1989 as a way to describe the oppression of African-American

612
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
women.

613
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,380
Crenshaw noticed that oppression based on race and oppression based on sex were separate

614
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
but intertwined.

615
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,780
And in the wake of the dissolution of the Frankfurt School in America and the fracturing

616
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,040
of critical theory as a discipline into separate groups, she found that she needed new language

617
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:33,860
to describe the intersection of race and sex.

618
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,240
Though the majority of prominent black activists of the second half of the 20th century were

619
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,520
all students of the original American Frankfurt School members, most notably Herbert Marcuse

620
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,080
mentoring Angela Davis, Kimberle Crenshaw was not one of them.

621
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,600
Crenshaw came to the idea of intersectionality after reading the writing of black activists

622
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,640
not descended from the Frankfurt School, like Sojourner Truth and Anna Julia Hayward Cooper.

623
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,800
Crenshaw observed during her time at university that the intersection of race and gender was

624
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:05,480
not well understood and that rather than the overlapping oppressions simply stacking up,

625
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,680
gender gave racial oppression a unique dynamic and vice versa.

626
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,600
However, Kimberle Crenshaw would eventually work with descendants of the Frankfurt School

627
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,160
like Angela Davis and they would influence each other.

628
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,720
Crenshaw would give them intersectionality and they would give in return Gramsci's

629
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
cultural hegemony.

630
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,640
Also, I know I'm dropping a lot of names in here right now, they really all do deserve

631
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,440
a deep dive and it can't be today.

632
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,760
The TLDR of Angela Davis is that she's a black activist whose legally owned guns were

633
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:33,000
given to the perpetrators of an armed takeover of a courtroom and the execution of a judge

634
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,480
in California in 1970, as well as a communist who believed that the prisoners of the Soviet

635
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,680
Union and its satellite states deserved to be purged because they were Zionist fascists

636
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,120
and opponents of socialism.

637
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,880
Yes, those were her words.

638
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,600
She has a long history of supporting political violence, repressive governments, and genuinely

639
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,900
awful organizations in the name of feminism, socialism, and black liberation.

640
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,120
In the modern day, she has taken on the public persona of being like any other aged black

641
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,280
activist, her violent past having largely been forgotten.

642
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,320
Meanwhile, Kimberle Crenshaw's area of expertise was in law and she applied Gramsci's cultural

643
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,160
hegemony to that sphere, creating critical legal theory.

644
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:13,440
She theorized that laws exist to maintain society's status quo and that in so far

645
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,220
as that status quo is bigoted, the law serves to codify that bigotry.

646
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,160
In this way, the liberals' colorblindness will always be racist, in Crenshaw's view

647
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:25,560
anyway, because that colorblindness must necessarily insist on an equality that doesn't exist.

648
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,320
For Crenshaw, if the law treats everyone equally without prejudice, then it is blind to the

649
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:33,680
reason as to why, say, more black people are locked up per capita than white people

650
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
in America.

651
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,440
And for Crenshaw, the solution to that problem is a Gramsciian one.

652
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,120
Subvert the process and develop counter hegemony.

653
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,780
Critical race theory and critical gender theory and queer theory, all of it, it is all descended

654
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,960
from this origin.

655
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,680
This is why so many leftists will say, why are you so pissed that CRT is being taught

656
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,680
in schools?

657
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
It's just a legal thing.

658
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,680
You don't even know what CRT is.

659
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,820
And yeah, a lot of conservatives don't know what CRT is.

660
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,920
But this is why you should be pissed.

661
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
It's anti-liberal.

662
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,480
Therefore, critical race theory, being Gramsciian in origin, posits that in America, bourgeois

663
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,540
hegemony is white hegemony, that countercultural action to foster liberation must be through

664
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:10,880
black culture, and that liberalism's attempt to create a neutral playing field through

665
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,840
colorblind value-neutral policies only serves to reinforce white hegemony by not explicitly

666
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,520
privileging black people.

667
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,260
Kimberle Crenshaw has no problem in her own writing making this explicitly clear.

668
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,140
In her article, Race, Reform, and Retrenchment, she writes,

669
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:31,460
Oppressed people sometimes advance by creating ideological and political crisis, but the

670
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,700
form of the crisis-producing challenge must reflect the institutional logic of the system.

671
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:40,860
Gramsci called the struggle a war of position, and he regarded it as the most appropriate

672
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,380
strategy for change in Western societies.

673
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,960
According to Gramsci, direct challenges to the dominant class accomplish little if ideology

674
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:51,860
plays such a central role in establishing authority that the legitimacy of the dominant

675
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,420
regime is not challenged.

676
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,980
Consequently, the challenges in such societies is to create a counter-hegemony by maneuvering

677
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:02,080
within and expanding the dominant ideology to embrace the potential for change.

678
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,380
Both critical race theorists and intersectional feminists are descended from Crenshaw's

679
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,220
work, most notably in the online space, Robin DiAngelo and her white fragility nonsense.

680
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,100
But there's tons of people out there who view subversive action against liberal society

681
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,860
as an a priori good and not just in terms of critical race theory.

682
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,560
For example, you can look at critical queer theory and find people talking about how earlier

683
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,180
waves of gay and trans activism were assimilationist in nature because they focused on trying to

684
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,980
make hegemonic culture accept them through things like normalizing gay marriage or appealing

685
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,780
to the stereotypical hyper-femininity of a trans woman, when what they should have been

686
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,660
doing is engaging in the most disruptive, degenerate behaviors imaginable in order to

687
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,020
foster a counterculture that can oppose bourgeois hegemony.

688
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,500
But that is a whole extra can of worms I'm going to have to cover another day.

689
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,620
The point is, critical theory as a movement, as well as the Frankfurt School before it,

690
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:56,700
view the liberals' attempt to build a neutral space where ideas can be debated and considered

691
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,140
as a weakness that socialists can exploit in order to begin the process of tearing liberalism

692
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
down.

693
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,100
And all you have to do is read their writing to see it.

694
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,100
Crenshaw wrote,

695
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,000
Black people can afford it neither to resign themselves to nor to attack frontally the

696
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
legitimacy and the incoherence of the dominant ideology.

697
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,100
The subordinate position of blacks in this society make it unlikely that African Americans

698
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,300
will realize gains through the kind of direct challenge to the legitimacy of American liberal

699
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,500
ideology that is now being waged by critical scholars.

700
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:27,780
On the other hand, delegitimating race consciousness would be directly relevant to black needs,

701
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,180
and this strategy will sometimes require the pragmatic use of liberal ideology.

702
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,980
Marcuse said something similar in that long passage earlier from Counter-Revolution and

703
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:36,980
Revolt that,

704
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,820
The time of the wholesale rejection of the liberals has passed or is not yet to come.

705
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,760
That protests against the war, inflation, and unemployment from a point of view of civil

706
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,720
rights could be tolerated as a tactical deployment of liberal ideals to be used and discarded

707
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,120
later, like how elections are a lesser evil.

708
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,560
Critical theorists use their analytical method to destabilize liberal systems and prime them

709
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,560
for revolution.

710
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,040
They only appeal to liberal values and ethics insofar as it will help them achieve this

711
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:13,840
goal.

712
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:17,960
In case it's not yet clear that Sock Dunn Left is talking out of his gaping asshole

713
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
for his entire article when he says,

714
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,840
Conservatives are lying and grifting because they claimed Gramsci said something he didn't

715
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,360
say, even though socialists still believe in all of the underlying ethics anyway.

716
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,480
I hope this is the final nail in the coffin regarding any assumptions of good faith in

717
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,120
his part, or at the very least, that he actually reads any of the theory that he cites.

718
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,820
There is a clear lineage from Antonio Gramsci to the present day, and the craziest thing

719
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:43,520
about it all is, when I took that 2007 class, this stuff wasn't exactly kept secret, but

720
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,240
it wasn't being shouted from the rooftops either.

721
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,840
My professor made it clear that this was very serious, very subversive stuff, and while

722
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:53,600
it wasn't to be kept under wraps, it was meant to make us critical theorists.

723
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,320
He was clear about viewing his class as a political project, his contribution to the

724
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
creation of counter-hegemony.

725
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,200
It's only after my generation, the millennials, left university, entered the workforce, and

726
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,240
began to implement this shit, that wider society began to take notice, and the subversives

727
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
began to panic.

728
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,840
Here's one example of what I mean.

729
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,660
If you go to the Wikipedia article on Cultural Marxism, you'll get this passage.

730
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:18,340
The term Cultural Marxism refers to a far-right anti-Semitic conspiracy theory which claims

731
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,120
that Western Marxism is the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert

732
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,200
Western culture.

733
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,920
The conspiracy theory misrepresents the Frankfurt School as being responsible for modern progressive

734
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,720
movements, identity politics, and political correctness, claiming that there is an ongoing

735
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,420
and intentional subversion of Western society via a planned culture war that undermines

736
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,320
the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism and seeks to replace them with the culturally

737
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,520
liberal values of the 1960s.

738
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,260
Although similarities with the Nazi propaganda term Cultural Bolshevism has been noted, the

739
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,500
contemporary conspiracy theory originated in the United States during the 1990s.

740
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,700
Originally found only on the far-right political fringe, the term began to enter mainstream

741
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,460
discourse in the 2010s and is now found globally.

742
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:04,060
The conspiracy theory of a Marxist culture war is promoted by right-wing politicians,

743
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:07,420
fundamentalist religious leaders, political commentators in mainstream print and television

744
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:12,000
media, and white supremacist terrorists, and has been described as a foundational element

745
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,340
of the alt-right worldview.

746
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,700
Now, to me, this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

747
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:21,660
In fact, it seems to be an outright lie because my professor, back in 2007, explicitly referred

748
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,220
to what we were talking about as Cultural Marxism.

749
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,520
It was not the name of some false conspiracy theory back then.

750
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,920
It was what underpinned critical theory.

751
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,860
We learned to attack aspects of hegemonic culture, mainly pop culture, let's be honest.

752
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,760
It was an intro-level course, through media criticism meant to deconstruct and demoralize,

753
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:43,140
with the long-term purpose being the creation of a space where an alternative, and preferably

754
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,100
socialist, counterculture could form.

755
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:49,260
The Wikipedia article frames this as if it's false and anti-Semitic and only neo-Nazis

756
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,740
believe it or something, but in my experience, this is exactly what it is, and back then

757
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,100
they had no problem just outright saying it.

758
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,740
What's really interesting is, if you look at the Cultural Marxism Wikipedia article

759
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,220
from 2014, it's more or less accurate.

760
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:06,100
Cultural Marxism is an offshoot of Marxism that conceives of culture as central to the

761
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,880
legitimization of oppression, in addition to economic factors.

762
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,560
An outgrowth of Western Marxism, especially from Antonio Gramsci in the Frankfurt School,

763
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,720
Cultural Marxism argues that what appears as traditional cultural phenomenon intrinsic

764
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,380
to Western society, for instance capitalism, nationalism, the nuclear family, gender roles,

765
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,900
race, and other forms of cultural identity, serve to justify and maintain hierarchy.

766
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,980
Cultural Marxists use Marxist methods to make it possible to criticize what appears natural,

767
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:32,980
but is in fact ideological.

768
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,180
This is pretty much spot on, all of the writing I've referenced today shows it to be spot

769
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,180
on.

770
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
And you know what?

771
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,140
Other lesser known Wikipedia articles still reinforce this too, but the article that everyone's

772
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,020
been searching in the past few years, Cultural Marxism, is the one that's been changed

773
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,580
to try and hide the smoke.

774
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:53,260
The contents of the old Cultural Marxism page have just been moved to a new heading in Wikipedia

775
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,660
called Marxist Cultural Analysis.

776
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:59,260
This really is some we're not doing it and it's good that it's happening shit.

777
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:03,700
On this page, the claim is made that the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory is an influential

778
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,660
discourse in the far right without any clear relationship to Marxist Cultural Analysis.

779
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,740
On the current Cultural Marxism page, a similar claim is made.

780
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:16,100
Scholarly analysis of the conspiracy theory has concluded that the Cultural Marxism conspiracy

781
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,380
theory has no basis in fact.

782
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:22,420
Both of these passages cite the article, Who's Afraid of the Frankfurt School?

783
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,580
Cultural Marxism as an Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory, by Joanne Braun from the Journal of

784
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,580
Social Justice.

785
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,300
Okay, now this sounds like some, we've investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong shit

786
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,300
too.

787
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,140
Of course, we should give the devil his due.

788
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,920
I read the article and it's not very good.

789
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,900
The article supports its claim that Cultural Marxism is an antisemitic conspiracy theory

790
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,460
by focusing on three specific proponents of the theory and claiming that because they

791
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,040
are antisemitic, the theory must also be antisemitic.

792
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,180
These three people are Kevin Macdonald, William S. Lind, and Paul Gottfried.

793
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,700
Regarding Kevin Macdonald, Braun is just correct.

794
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,220
He is antisemitic, seemingly to the core.

795
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,700
He's an evolutionary psychology professor, but he's most well known for a trilogy of

796
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,980
books called The Culture of Critique, where he uses his EvoPsych knowledge to claim that

797
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,860
Jews have evolved to undermine the societies in which they live as a form of biologically

798
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,020
fixed extreme in-group preference.

799
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:15,260
It's safe to say that this guy's a quack.

800
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,180
For William S. Lind, Braun even admits that he doesn't focus his critique of Cultural

801
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:24,260
Marxism on the Jews, but that his theory does have what she calls antisemitic dimensions.

802
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,140
One of these dimensions she's referring to is his use of the term globalist in his

803
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:30,020
objections to international capitalism.

804
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,460
Now, I personally don't know what that has to do with the Jews, because when I hear international

805
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:38,340
capitalists I don't think Jews, and I'm pretty sure that most people who use the word

806
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,900
globalist isn't thinking Jews either.

807
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,460
Nonetheless, Braun did dig up what she calls a Holocaust denial conference from back in

808
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:50,140
2002, where Lind made the remark that the people in the Frankfurt School were all Jews.

809
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,940
I looked into this event, and it seems to actually have been a paleoconservative conference.

810
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:57,180
There were definitely some Holocaust snares there, but Lind wasn't one of them, and

811
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,980
he explicitly pointed out that disagreement in his speech.

812
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,780
It may very well be the case that Lind is actually an antisemite, but not once does

813
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:07,880
Jewishness come up in his discussions of Cultural Marxism, and regardless of his motivations,

814
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,320
his critique is solid and factual.

815
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:13,340
Regarding Paul Gottfried, Braun's case is the weakest.

816
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:18,140
She admits that Gottfried is Jewish himself, and studied under Herbert Marcuse in his youth.

817
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:22,100
The only points she can muster against him are ultimately irrelevant character attacks,

818
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:26,540
like how he calls himself a paleoconservative, a term that he coined in fact, or how he mentored

819
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:27,540
Richard Spencer.

820
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,620
And Braun can't even make the emotional weight of that charge stick because she immediately

821
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:34,880
admits that Spencer is far more extreme than Gottfried.

822
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,340
But most importantly of all, even if all three of these men were vicious antisemites and

823
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,020
open goose-stepping Nazis and all the rest of it, that doesn't make Cultural Marxism

824
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,580
an alt-right antisemitic fascist conspiracy theory, nor does it prove it to be factually

825
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,580
incorrect.

826
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,340
The correct thing is still correct, even if people that you find distasteful believe

827
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,340
it.

828
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,920
Beyond these three men, Braun seems to have no real argument except, bad people believe

829
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,320
this, therefore it's wrong.

830
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,860
She claims that Anders Breivik was influenced by the idea to commit his shooting.

831
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,220
And while that's certainly bad, that doesn't disprove the idea.

832
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:12,540
She claims that Andrew Breitbart, Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, and Brazilian

833
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,940
President Bolsonaro's son all believe in the theory, and that also doesn't disprove

834
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,940
it.

835
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:22,020
She also makes a list of very strange claims about Cultural Marxism, including that

836
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:48,940
you're a Nazi.

837
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:49,940
3.

838
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:53,900
It's the source of the view that leftists sometimes engage in pro-pedophile activism,

839
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,600
when according to Braun, this never happens, and it's only ever sex ed in schools and

840
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,000
accepting trans identities.

841
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,500
So if you think it's happening because, you know, you see it, you're a Nazi.

842
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,920
It's really incredible just how much she gaslights the reader here.

843
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,700
The entire foundation of this article is, bad people believe in this idea, therefore

844
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,980
it's false, and if you believe in it, you're bad too.

845
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,600
Which is pretty dogshit reasoning.

846
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,040
If you believe in any of this stuff, and there is proof for it happening at least sometimes,

847
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,260
then you're an alt-right neo-nazi cultural Marxist believer who hates the Jews, because

848
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,960
you believe in, you know, reality.

849
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,960
That's it.

850
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,080
That's the entire crux of her argument.

851
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:32,580
Joanne Braun is a professor at Gonzaga University in the Department of Leadership Studies.

852
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,980
You can actually get a leadership studies degree.

853
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,880
As far as I can tell, it's all about teaching you how to be a socially conscious middle

854
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,680
manager or HR department head.

855
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,200
Geez, and I thought my degree was worthless.

856
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,100
She is, surprise surprise, another academic descended from the Frankfurt School, and she

857
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,920
focuses specifically on critical hate studies and intersections of religion and socialism.

858
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,280
And normally I would not get into this because it's not relevant, fuck you if you think

859
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:56,280
I'm dog whistling here, but she's Jewish.

860
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,280
A Jewish intellectual who believes that everybody who disagrees with her politics is a Nazi

861
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,100
isn't somebody you can rely on for having an accurate view of this topic.

862
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,240
Not because she's Jewish, you weirdos, but because she's biased.

863
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,880
Cultural Marxism posits that leftist academics, artists, and activists, guided by Graham Shee's

864
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,340
theory of cultural hegemony, are subverting liberal institutions to create counter-hegemony,

865
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,360
and that their school of thought is the Frankfurt School.

866
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,360
Leftist academics, artists, and activists are not only saying that this is false, despite

867
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,920
the mountains of political writing to the contrary on the topic, but that you're an

868
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,280
anti-Semite if you believe it.

869
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,440
And the primary source justifying this belief that cultural Marxism is not only false, but

870
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,800
inherently anti-Semitic, is a leftist academic, artist, and activist, from the very same Frankfurt

871
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,240
School being critiqued, who serves to benefit, both personally and politically, if everyone

872
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,840
who believes in cultural Marxism is considered a Nazi by the public.

873
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:51,320
And this is the scholarly source that Wikipedia leans on to make the claim that cultural Marxism

874
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,840
is false and anti-Semitic.

875
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:57,640
I have never seen a more precise reason as to why people tend to not trust academics

876
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,160
and experts anymore.

877
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,120
Most people, including Braun, claim that cultural Marxism as a conspiracy theory is

878
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:09,400
a continuation of cultural Bolshevism or Judeo-Bolshevism, which actually was a real anti-Semitic conspiracy

879
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:14,680
theory in Nazi Germany that accused Jewish intellectuals of using art and music to subvert

880
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,820
German culture.

881
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:20,040
The Nazis called the works degenerate art and used them to justify censoring speech

882
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
and expression.

883
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,880
They believe the revolution in Russia was a Jewish plot, due primarily to the involvement

884
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,780
of Leon Trotsky, a Jewish-Ukrainian socialist revolutionary that we've talked about at

885
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,180
length in this channel before.

886
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,420
The Nazis believed that the Jews were the parasitic element that was destroying the

887
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,140
German working class, and that Soviet Russia was an example of that element's victory.

888
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:41,500
Judeo-Bolshevism is actually an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.

889
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:45,640
There is no evidence that Jewish intellectuals specifically used culture to undermine Germany.

890
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:50,100
There is no evidence that Jewish people were actually parasitizing the German working class.

891
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:54,420
There is no evidence that Bolsheviks in Russia were the culmination of a Jewish revolutionary

892
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:55,420
plot.

893
00:52:55,420 --> 00:53:00,220
While Cultural Marxism follows the same basic form, revolutionaries using culture to subvert

894
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,900
hegemony, it has nothing else in common with Judeo-Bolshevism.

895
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:08,820
Neither Antonio Gramsci nor Giorgi Lukas nor Rudi Duchke were Jewish, and the Jewish origins

896
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,420
of the Frankfurt School have nothing to do with their motivations.

897
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,740
I didn't even mention it until this chapter of the video because it's not relevant.

898
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:20,780
But most importantly of all, unlike with Judeo-Bolshevism, there is ample amounts of evidence across

899
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,100
many different political theorists, spanning nearly 100 years now, that at least some socialists

900
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,060
view Cultural Marxism, or Gramsciian Socialism, or Critical Theory, or whatever you want to

901
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,300
call it, as a viable path forward for their revolution.

902
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,240
It seems to me that the people who are insisting that all of this stuff is just anti-Semitism,

903
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,960
and that you're a Nazi if you notice it's happening, are simply making a last-ditch

904
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,060
effort to try and preserve their growing counter-hegemony by shaming you into compliance through slander,

905
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:51,820
justified in their minds by a non-existent connection to a previous anti-Semitic conspiracy

906
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,100
theory that kinda looks similar if you really squint your eyes.

907
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,060
And honestly, if some people are just really triggered by calling it Cultural Marxism due

908
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:02,900
to this trumped-up connection, fine, call it Western Marxism, call it Marxist Cultural

909
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:03,900
Critique.

910
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:07,460
Hell, you can even call it the infinitely more neutral Institutional Capture, since

911
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,740
it's not like socialists are the only people who subvert liberal institutions when they

912
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,740
can.

913
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:13,740
The label doesn't matter.

914
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:15,200
What matters is, it's happening.

915
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:30,040
And as liberals, we need to be aware that it's happening.

916
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:32,040
And that brings us to the present day.

917
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,100
So let's recap.

918
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,320
Antonio Gramsci's experience with the factory workers' revolt, the Italian Socialist Party's

919
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,800
reluctance to support them, and Mussolini taking advantage of that situation, and winning

920
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,960
the popular support of the Italian working class, led him to develop a theory of bourgeois

921
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,320
cultural hegemony.

922
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:50,400
The proletariat would never reach class consciousness as long as the bourgeois continued to culturally

923
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,960
educate them against their own interests.

924
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:55,920
So the job of the socialist revolutionary was to undermine the culture and subversively

925
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,880
create countercultures to make the liberal state weak enough that a direct conflict could

926
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:00,880
be won.

927
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,200
Though Gramsci's prison notebooks did not actually get published until after his death,

928
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,400
he did share his ideas around Vienna's socialist scene, greatly influencing Georgi Lucas, who

929
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,720
became one of the Frankfurt School's founders.

930
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,080
This ideological strain of Marxism would be called Western Marxism, to differentiate

931
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,200
it from the Soviet-style Eastern Marxism.

932
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:21,560
Both the members of the Frankfurt School, as well as other French intellectuals not

933
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,220
strictly affiliated with it, were heavily influenced by this idea, and more formally

934
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:29,680
developed Gramsci's ideas into a theory of subversion by a long march through liberal

935
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:30,680
institutions.

936
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,280
Academic, cultural, journalistic, legal, all of it.

937
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,220
During the American period of the Frankfurt School, American contributions created critical

938
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,480
legal theory, which originally began as a method of analyzing law, but was rapidly adopted

939
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,040
to cultural analysis, critique, and activism.

940
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:48,600
The discipline fractured across intersectional lines in the wake of neoconservatism's popularity,

941
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:52,720
with the most well-known strain today being critical race theory, due to a push to have

942
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,680
it taught in American schools, and a reaction to that attempt by the American right-wing.

943
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,520
But all throughout these transformations and differing theorists, it remains Gramsciian

944
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,800
at its core.

945
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,200
Use critical analysis to expose hegemony's weaknesses, build countercultures to propagandize

946
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,140
the masses, and soften liberal society in preparation for a revolution.

947
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,900
Gramsci probably didn't consider that his theory would be used in the service of American

948
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,560
racial minorities or sexual minorities, but he laid the groundwork that later people would

949
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,180
adopt to establish their own subversive movements.

950
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,000
Understanding all of this will help you properly contextualize a lot of the stuff we see nowadays

951
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,680
on all levels of society.

952
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,780
Look at something large, like diversity hires and quotas, and affirmative action in society's

953
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:35,840
largest institutions, from schools giving blatant racial privileges to minorities, or

954
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,780
rainbow capitalism in the biggest companies in the world.

955
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:44,280
Look at something medium-sized, like shitty, forced diversity, inclusion, and equity initiatives

956
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,400
in pop culture and entertainment media, where the quality of the art takes a backseat to

957
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,980
ensuring that minorities always take center stage, and leftist agitators demand that more

958
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,060
cultural properties be ceded to their politics.

959
00:56:56,060 --> 00:57:00,820
Hell, look at something small, like the unending, cancerous fucking discussions about appropriately

960
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:02,420
platforming problematic people.

961
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:06,120
On a personal level, I know my friend Stardust recently went through that, where she decided

962
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,160
to talk to Richard Spencer on her stream, and some retard raked her over the coals for

963
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,720
not using her 10,000 sub YouTube channel responsibly by his estimation.

964
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,200
All of these disparate things flow from this source and serve this purpose.

965
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:24,600
The desire to move the world more leftward, inch by inch, space by space, thought by thought,

966
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,280
that is the primary objective.

967
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,120
The second objective is, for those people in spaces that won't move leftward, or even

968
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:34,640
just don't care, either demoralizing them until they capitulate, or isolating them until

969
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,960
they radicalize, lose all their support, and become irrelevant.

970
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,120
This is the reason why every single event has to push a leftist agenda or be considered

971
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
fascist.

972
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,140
This is the reason why liberals or centrists cannot remain unaligned.

973
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,320
They have to be forced into one of two extremist camps, either to be propagandized as a fellow

974
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,960
subversive, or to be identified as an enemy and destroyed.

975
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,000
Now, none of this means that if, for example, a black person complains about being treated

976
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,880
in a racist way, that that's critical race theory, and it's part of the socialist subversion,

977
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,200
and we need to stamp it out and enforce a strictly racist, pro-white culture or something.

978
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,620
That also doesn't mean that two gay men getting married is inherently advancing the dialectic

979
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,000
towards revolution, either.

980
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,900
The bulwark against this is ultimately liberal, colorblind, value-neutral policies, the very

981
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,880
thing that Kimberle Crenshaw denounced as racist and sexist and right-wing in her writing.

982
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,920
This is why, when they say, you need to give my group special consideration, we need equity,

983
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,060
not equality, you simply need to tell them, no.

984
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,180
This is the roadmap that they want to travel down.

985
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:38,740
They will appeal to liberal morality and sensibilities to get you to go down that path, but that's

986
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:39,860
part of the subversion.

987
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,240
And just like that often-misattributed quote from the start of the video, they are looking

988
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,420
to hang you with your own rope.

989
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,460
To be a liberal means to stand by those colorblind, value-neutral policies even as they look to

990
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,440
use your compassion against you.

991
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,520
It means to be tolerant of cultural differences and subcultures, but only to a point.

992
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,700
You are under no moral obligation to foster a revolution against you.

993
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,540
Starting in Gramscian subversive tactics, but from the right-wing, as a lot of dissident

994
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,100
rightists are currently advocating for, we'll certainly swing the pendulum back around,

995
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:12,340
but we will be faced with the exact same problem, only this time coming from the other direction.

996
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,680
The solution is based in unapologetic liberalism.

997
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:20,420
Whatever true crises that Gramscians and critical theorists identify with their analysis, liberalism

998
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,420
can fix without their revolutionary prescriptions.

999
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:25,260
There we go, that's my video on Antonio Gramsci.

1000
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:28,300
I've been talking about doing it for at least a year, but I didn't really start cracking

1001
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,100
open the Prison Notebook seriously until summer of 2022.

1002
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:34,940
Also, Sock Dunn Left is either a mid-wit, or more likely, he's a subversive himself

1003
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,620
who is saying it's not happening when he desperately wants it to happen.

1004
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:41,140
And speaking of him, I know I'm responding to a Twitter thread that is over a month old,

1005
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:44,360
but you know how the old saying goes, a lie can travel halfway around the world while

1006
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,100
the truth is still putting on its shoes.

1007
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,980
Yes, I know, that quote is commonly misattributed to Mark Twain, but I think it's fitting

1008
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:54,060
to end this video the way we began it, on a commonly repeated quote that was never actually

1009
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:56,580
said, but its underlying message still remains factual.

1010
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:00,540
It doesn't matter though, I don't expect Sock Dunn Left to actually watch this or anything.

1011
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:04,420
He's already moved on to making newer, dumber takes on Twitter that would likely take me

1012
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,720
another month to debunk properly as well.

1013
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,860
To borrow a phrase, the socialist intellectual ecosystem is broken.

1014
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,300
Leftist grifters don't have to care about the truth.
