0	8140	Sometimes, Twitter will drop a beautiful thing into your lap.
8140	12680	A person who is so out of left field, so wrong, he doesn't know how wrong he is.
12680	14480	Okay, that's pretty much everybody on Twitter.
14480	15480	All the time.
15480	20200	But today I'm talking about this thread by Sokden Left, everybody's favorite Dunning-Kruger
20200	21660	socialist femboy.
21660	25320	This isn't exactly how I wanted to start my morning, but I've got my coffee ready,
25320	35060	and now is about as good a time as any.
35060	39940	That capturing the culture quote from Gramsci is fake, or why the conservative intellectual
39940	41280	ecosystem is broken.
41280	43760	If you're a lefty, you've seen this Gramsci quote.
43760	48040	In the new order, socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration
48040	52400	of schools, universities, churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of
52400	53400	society.
53400	54400	It's fake.
54400	56000	You'll find this quote in Gramsci's writings.
56000	62160	It's a bad summary of Gramsci from Wardner 1996, Unholy Alliance, an insane screed about
62160	64120	how Freemasons control the world.
64120	65120	Why does this matter?
65120	67880	First, the conservative intellectual ecosystem is broken.
67880	73400	I counted over 50 uses of this fake quote in major conservative publications by prominent
73400	74400	conservatives.
74400	76060	Not one fact-checked it.
76060	79600	Billionaire backers means that rightists don't need to care about truth.
79600	83660	Rightists claim that leftists seize control of the institutions, and use that to justify
83660	85100	seizing control back.
85100	90480	In short, rightist pundits use a fake Gramsci quote created by an anti-Freemason conspiracist
90480	95060	to justify the existence of a secret communist conspiracy, which they use to justify destroying
95060	97420	claimed leftist institutions.
97420	100860	In shorter, the conservative intellectual ecosystem is broken.
100860	103420	Rightist grifters don't have to care about the truth.
103420	108540	Now, just so I'm not accused of being bad faith, Sock Dunn Left did go into detail on
108540	111440	a substack, which you can check out for yourself if you like.
111440	115040	But having read the whole article myself, I can confirm that the Twitter thread is a
115040	116400	pretty accurate summary of it.
116400	120760	I can additionally confirm that the information in the article is also mostly accurate, but
120760	125080	also that Sock Dunn Left misses the point, and it's actually very easy to see where
125080	126560	he goes off the rails.
126560	129120	But let's first start by giving credit where credit is due.
129120	133800	He's entirely correct when he says this quotation that conservatives tend to attribute to Gramsci
133800	135120	is mostly false.
135120	139640	Of these words, socialism is precisely the religion that must overwhelm Christianity.
139640	143960	In the New Order, socialism will triumph by first capturing the culture via infiltration
143960	147760	of schools, universities, churches, and the media by transforming the consciousness of
147760	148760	society.
148760	153400	Only that first line, socialism is the religion that must overwhelm Christianity, were actually
153400	154740	Gramsci's own words.
154740	159400	That passage comes from an article Gramsci wrote in the Italian socialist newspaper Avanti
159400	164120	in 1916, titled Odissia e Fede, or Audacity and Faith.
164120	167320	Listen, just because my dad's side of the family comes from Italy doesn't mean that
167320	169040	I know how to pronounce any of this shit.
169040	173420	The context is, Gramsci is publicly responding to the claims of a Christian socialist from
173420	177380	a different socialist publication, who thinks that socialism should become Christian.
177380	181500	Christian socialists believe that capitalism is rooted in the sin of greed, and that Jesus,
181500	185600	who lowered himself to the level of the destitute and fed the poor, was a socialist himself.
185600	190360	They also believe that the shared insular economies of monasteries were an ideal socialist
190360	192780	model for the collectivization of private property.
192780	197300	The idea that all humans, despite their earthly differences, are equal under God is an idea
197300	199260	well adapted to socialism.
199260	202060	Gramsci's response to the Christian socialist was this.
202060	205140	Socialism is precisely the religion that must kill Christianity.
205140	209340	Religion in the sense that it is also a faith, which has its mystics and practices.
209340	213180	Religion because it has replaced in the consciences to the transcendental God of Catholics.
213180	216700	Trust in man and in his best energies as the only spiritual reality.
216700	221140	Our gospel is modern philosophy, the one that does without the hypothesis of God in the
221140	222260	vision of the universe.
222260	224700	What only in history lays its foundations.
224700	233060	In other words, socialism must kill Christianity because socialism fulfills a similar function.
233060	236860	As a secular religion, it doesn't deal with the divine, but it does provide an ethical
236860	240060	system and a blueprint of the universe, which are at odds with the Christian one.
240060	244960	For Gramsci, Marx's historical materialist analytical method is how we determine what
244960	247440	we should do next, rather than God's law.
247440	251940	The rest of that incorrect quotation, in the new order socialism will triumph by first
251940	256140	capturing the culture via infiltration of schools, universities, churches, and the media
256140	260860	by transforming the consciousness of society, was never spoken or written by Gramsci.
260860	265500	Sock Dun Left claims that this quote first comes from a 1996 book, Unholy Alliances,
265500	269500	The Secret Plan and the Secret People Working to Destroy America, by James Wardner.
269500	273020	This book, which I admit I haven't read, seems to contain a lot of stuff about the
273020	276780	Freemasons secretly controlling the world from the shadows, and how all elections are
276780	280380	rigged, and how the Catholic Church has been infiltrated, and all that sort of stuff.
280380	283200	Wardner doesn't seem to think that the Jews are behind the new world order, though,
283200	284200	which is a bit surprising.
284200	286340	That's the one conspiracy theory he hasn't bought into.
286340	291580	The rest of the quote comes from Wardner paraphrasing Gramsci, and not actually Gramsci's own words.
291580	294280	This happens quite a lot in the internet quoting business, to be honest.
294280	298580	The famous socialist quote, The last capitalist shall sell us the rope we hang him with, is
298580	303200	attributed online to the writing of both Marx and Stalin, but actually comes from a private
303200	308280	note written by Lenin on a scrap of paper, later repeated by Yuri Anenkov, a Russian artist,
308280	309460	who claimed to have seen it.
309540	314260	Wardner wrote two books on this topic, Unholy Alliances and a second one, The Planned Destruction
314260	317940	of America, which seems to be more of the same, Communists and Freemasons.
317940	321420	There's videos of him talking about this stuff from back in the 90s.
321420	324980	Wardner died in 2016, and would you believe it, he was a Florida man.
324980	329220	In other words, Wardner is rather inconsequential to the story, all things considered.
329220	333540	But this quote, commonly attributed to Gramsci, for the most part, did come from this obscure
333540	338700	Freemason book where the author, whose ideas are more than a little dubious, gave his interpretation
338700	340120	of Gramsci's views.
340120	345140	The question then is, despite Wardner's eccentricities, is this summary of Gramsci's
345140	346140	view accurate?
346140	348220	What did Gramsci himself actually believe?
353500	357060	Antonio Gramsci was born on the island of Sardinia in the Kingdom of Italy.
357060	360860	He suffered from health problems all his life, due to what modern medicine now believes was
360860	364780	pot disease, which is a form of tuberculosis that can deform the spine.
364860	369100	Gramsci was an uber manlet due to the disease, less than five feet tall as an adult.
369100	373120	But he was intellectually gifted, and he won a scholarship to the University of Turin in
373120	374120	Northern Italy.
374120	378460	In his early years, Gramsci was a proponent of Sardinian nationalism, believing Sardinia's
378460	381980	poverty and mistreatment to be the fault of the central Italian government, which was
381980	385280	focusing its attention on the rapidly industrializing north.
385280	389240	But after attending university, he began to believe that socialism and not nationalism
389240	392620	would ultimately solve the problems of the Sardinian working class.
392620	396880	While at the University of Turin, Gramsci was influenced by a wide spectrum of ideas.
396880	400620	From Benedetto Crose, who at the time was one of Italy's most well-respected liberal
400620	404940	thinkers, to Giovanni Gentile, who is most notable for becoming the most prolific philosopher
404940	406140	of fascism.
406140	411460	From 1917, socialist rioting in Turin had led to the arrest of many notable socialists.
411460	415940	This left holes in Turin's socialist scene, which Antonio Gramsci's fierce intellect
415940	417060	allowed him to fill.
417060	420020	He was elected to the Socialist Party's provisional committee, and eventually set
420020	421980	up the newspaper that attracted Lenin's attention.
422340	428980	In English, Lenin viewed Gramsci's group as being the closest faction in the Italian
428980	432820	socialist community that was equivalent to the Bolsheviks of Russia, and granted him
432820	434940	his support at the Third International.
434940	438420	This was due to Gramsci's support of the Italian workers' councils, which had appeared
438420	442340	spontaneously during the general strike of 1919.
442340	446380	Organizations that Gramsci had conceptualized as being like the Soviets in Russia.
446380	450020	These councils are actually quite important in the development of Gramsci's ideas, so
450020	451360	let's talk about them for a bit.
451740	455800	This era of Italian history is known as the Bienno Rosso, or in English, the Two Red Years,
455800	461220	a period of significant economic and social instability lasting from 1919 to 1920.
461220	465760	As I mentioned in my video, The Three Forms of Fascism, Italy incurred great economic
465760	467760	costs to mobilize for World War I.
467760	470700	And at the end of the war, when all those soldiers returned home, they discovered that
470700	475080	with their addition to the workforce, there were too many workers and not enough work.
475080	479160	High unemployment and high inflation led to a significant increase in the price of basic
479160	480160	goods.
480160	484120	Large swathes of Italian society ended up joining various revolutionary groups during
484120	487960	this period, from the Italian Socialist Party, which Gramsci was a member of, to the Italian
487960	492000	Syndicalist Union, which advocated for Italy's entry into the war in the first place, to
492000	495600	the Italian Fighting League, which was the precursor to Mussolini's black shirts.
495600	500680	This period saw widespread striking among both city laborers and rural peasants, street
500680	505420	violence, and eventually workers seizing factories with force after their owners tried to lock
505420	506420	them out.
506420	510900	These workers created the Italian worker councils that Gramsci viewed as being the equivalent
510900	512360	of Italian Soviets.
512360	515180	But the rest of the Italian Socialist Party didn't agree.
515180	519100	According to William Peltz's book on the period, Against Capitalism, the workers' councils
519100	523220	didn't just want to negotiate with the owners of the factories, they wanted to control the
523220	527900	factories directly with the council structure taking the place of the owners, a demand that
527900	532620	despite Gramsci's support, the Italian Socialist Party did not endorse.
532620	537480	By 1921, the economy had become so disrupted and unproductive that the Italian working
537480	540360	class was hit with mass layoffs and wage cuts.
540360	543240	The workers' councils fell apart, and a lot of the people who supported them, feeling
543240	547200	betrayed by the lack of direct action on the part of the Italian Socialist Party, would
547200	551520	end up joining the Italian Fighting League and following Mussolini instead, as during
551520	556320	this same period, they had proven themselves more than capable of engaging in direct violence
556320	557680	against the liberal state.
557680	561600	In fact, while Mussolini's initial backers were Italian veterans of the First World War,
561600	566780	his first huge upswell of popular grassroots support were primarily farmers, factory workers,
566780	571180	and middle-class laborers who were fed up with the Italian Socialist Party's all-talk,
571180	574300	no-action reputation when it came to revolutionary action.
574300	579340	It was the influence of these workers' councils that partially led Mussolini to adopt George
579340	583900	Sorel's National Syndicalism philosophy when he began to conceptualize a more coherent
583900	585340	fascist ideology.
585340	589260	For Antonio Gramsci, all of this meant that he believed he was ultimately correct about
589260	592460	the revolutionary potential of the factory workers' councils, and that the Italian
592460	596400	Socialist Party had missed a vital chance to secure a revolution, something that Mussolini
596400	597660	had taken advantage of.
597660	601560	This was not the only split between Gramsci and the rest of the Italian Socialist Party.
601560	605320	The militant group are diti del popo, or the people's daring ones.
605320	609220	Socialist thugs, who were tasked with confronting Mussolini's equally thuggish blackshirts
609220	613080	in the streets, was denounced by the Italian Socialist Party, but supported by Gramsci
613080	616440	and Lenin as proletarian violence against fascism.
616440	620940	By 1922, Gramsci was called to Moscow to receive official Russian support.
620940	623980	It was here that he would meet his wife, with whom he had two sons.
623980	625420	Gramsci would never see his youngest.
625420	629560	Lenin instructed Gramsci to return to Italy, take leadership of the Italian Socialist Party,
629560	633280	unite Italy's leftists, and provide a bulwark against fascism.
633280	636820	While Gramsci was out of the country, Mussolini purged many of the leaders of the Italian
636820	641180	Socialist Party, making Gramsci's task of taking control a lot easier when he returned.
641180	645780	However, Gramsci made little progress in uniting Italy's left, because Mussolini's fascism
645780	648860	proved to be significantly more popular among the working class.
648860	652720	The revolutionary fervor of the proletariat against the liberal state was fulfilled through
652720	656840	Mussolini's embracing of street violence, while the property and profit of the bourgeois
656840	661200	was tentatively respected as long as they followed the direction of the fascists through
661200	664120	the national syndicalist model Mussolini had imposed on them.
664120	668600	It's no surprise to me that Mussolini was able to attract so many socialists, anarchists,
668600	672300	and working class members to the fledgling fascism, despite their obvious differences.
672320	676760	George Sorel famously stated that Mussolini's blending of the national and the social had
676760	681360	made fascism a completely new philosophy outside of the understanding of the socialist dialectic,
681360	686100	and that Mussolini was solving the contradictions of capitalism by destroying both the proletariat
686100	691640	and the bourgeois as distinct classes, leaving only the state and its organs in their place.
691640	696260	The popular view of fascism in its day was that it was the next political step of progress
696260	700800	beyond socialism, a notion among Italy's working class that Antonio Gramsci failed
700800	702780	to shake with his own activism.
702780	708280	By September 11, 1926, Gino Lucetti, an anarchist with the People's Daring Ones, attempted
708280	712580	to assassinate Mussolini by throwing a bomb at his limo during a public appearance.
712580	716540	This attempt on his life, along with others in the same year, led to the abolishment of
716540	720740	the Italian Socialist Party and the creation of OVRA, the Organization for Vigilance and
720740	724060	Repression of Anti-Fascism, the fascist secret police in Italy.
724060	728120	All Italian Socialist Party members, including Gramsci, were rounded up and imprisoned.
728120	731960	There is some evidence that the fascists staged at least a few of the attacks on Mussolini's
731960	736060	life as a pretense for gaining power, but the Lucetti bomb-throwing event is firmly
736060	739980	established as not a false flag, but a real assassination attempt.
739980	744480	In any case, it gave Mussolini the justification to finally wash away the last remnants of
744480	749000	the old parliamentary democracy, and Gramsci, as the last remaining nexus of fascist resistance,
749000	750300	was washed away along with it.
758120	772720	The fascist recognized that Gramsci posed a significant threat to their movement due
772720	773840	to his intellect.
773840	780000	His prosecutor at trial famously stated, for 20 years, we must stop this brain from functioning.
780000	784780	Gramsci survived 11 years behind bars, before finally dying at the age of 46.
784780	786280	What killed him is debated.
786280	790240	While there is no doubt that the fascists treated him exceptionally poorly behind bars,
790240	793640	his situation was also exacerbated by his lifelong poor health.
793640	798000	One of the forewords of the Prison Notebooks states that Mussolini moved Gramsci from prison
798000	801960	to the hospital near the end of his life to make it look like he died of natural causes,
801960	804040	a gambit that ultimately didn't work.
804040	807180	And I guess that's as good a time as any to start talking about the Prison Notebooks.
807180	811600	The Prison Notebooks are the most influential pieces of socialist theory that Antonio Gramsci
811600	813000	contributed to the movement.
813000	817520	They are a disorganized and often unfinished collection of essays, spread out across 33
817520	820640	notebooks, written entirely while under fascist guard.
820640	825360	Gramsci spent his 11 years behind bars, alternating between a jail cell, a doctor's office, and
825360	829080	eventually due to his declining health and international outcry, in exile where he was
829080	832280	permitted to go on short walks and was given magazines to read.
832280	835540	This wasn't really freedom, though, as his walks were monitored by the fascists, all
835540	839180	of his reading materials were pre-screened, and his letters to his family were read before
839180	841160	they were delivered by Gramsci's sister-in-law.
841160	845280	As a result, Gramsci had to be careful about what he wrote, as the fascist guards could
845280	848860	at any time decide to read what he was up to, and they occasionally did.
848860	852520	So Gramsci had to couch his language using more generalized terms.
852520	857280	For example, Gramsci tends to use the phrase dominant group when talking about the bourgeois.
857280	861560	The socialists have a language of their own in a sense, with terms like bourgeois, proletariat,
861560	865040	means of production, and Gramsci avoided using them as much as possible.
865040	869520	The Prison Notebooks were published with each essay being introduced by either Quentin Hoare
869520	873520	or Geoffrey Noel Smith, the translators, each offering their own interpretation of
873520	874520	the writing.
874520	878440	Therefore, in order to avoid censorship by his fascist jailers, a lot of Gramsci's
878440	880640	writing in the Prison Notebooks is indirect.
880640	884640	In fact, the most famous example of this is that meme that began Sock Dunn-Leff's Twitter
884640	885640	thread.
885640	888880	The quote being referenced here in this image of Bart and Homer is another of Gramsci's
888880	889880	most famous lines.
889880	893000	The old world is dying and the new world struggles to be born.
893000	894440	Now is the time of monsters.
894440	897860	I can see why it became a quote, it's quite poetic and evocative, and sometimes people
897860	901580	use it to try to draw links between Gramsci and Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister.
901580	905820	By pointing out that Goebbels said in 1939, we know today the old world is dying and we
905820	907620	are seeing the struggle for a new world.
907620	908880	But there's no link here.
908880	912180	Before the Prison Notebooks were published, nobody outside of Gramsci, his friends who
912180	916500	smuggled them out, and the low-level fascist guards who read them even knew of their existence.
916500	921040	It's much more likely that because fascism and socialism are both modernist ideologies
921040	924800	interested in revolution and rebirth, the wiping clean of old orders, and the construction
924800	929120	of a new society, a new man, Gramsci and Goebbels appealed to the same sentiments out
929120	930220	of coincidence.
930220	934760	The original form of Gramsci's monsters quote is, the crisis consists precisely in
934760	937800	the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born.
937800	941580	In this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.
941580	943360	What are these morbid symptoms?
943360	944360	Gramsci doesn't really say.
944360	948200	The next sentence reads, this paragraph should be completed by some observations which I
948200	950860	made on the so-called problem of the younger generation.
950860	953300	Like I said, a lot of these essays went unfinished.
953300	956600	So what did he mean by morbid symptoms?
956600	960720	Some people think that Gramsci meant the emergence of fascism in the face of revolutionary worker
960720	965100	fervor and the failure of the Italian Socialist Party in, uh, capitalizing on the opportunity.
965100	969020	However, other people think that he meant the Italian Socialist Party's ultra-left-wing
969020	973040	turn at the Third International, abandoning their liberal and social democratic allies
973040	976540	at Lenin's encouragement, under the misguided belief that fascism was going to collapse
976540	978040	all on its own within months.
978040	979260	There's no clear answer here.
979260	983120	The point I'm getting at is, in actually examining the content of the Prison Notebooks,
983120	986620	you have to read between the lines a bit more than you might otherwise.
986620	989420	Gramsci's not going to come out and say what he's advocating, the way that Karl Marx
989420	990420	did in the Communist Manifesto.
990420	994500	And I know that Sock Dunleff's whole argument hinges on, but Gramsci didn't specifically
994500	995500	say that.
995500	996500	But come on, you're a socialist.
996500	1000480	You're used to hearing dog whistles everywhere, from edgy jokes about the Holocaust, to stone
1000480	1002100	toss comics, to gamer words.
1002100	1006660	Hell, you even made an entire other article about dog whistling, what it is, how to spot
1006660	1007660	it, why it's bad.
1007660	1010700	Oh, except you don't think it's bad, as long as your side is the one doing it, of
1010700	1011700	course.
1011700	1015000	If you're just straining yourself to read between the lines so hard that you think people
1015000	1020000	like Sargon, or hell, even somebody as milquetoast as Tim Pool are fascists, then you can read
1020000	1023180	between the lines a little bit for Antonio Gramsci as well.
1023180	1027160	When Sock Dunleff said, correctly, that the quote conservatives throw around was a false
1027160	1028720	one, I replied on Twitter with,
1028720	1033440	It's true this quote is fake, but the idea behind it is absolutely Gramsciant, despite
1033440	1034880	what SDL claims.
1034880	1039400	The section, The Formation of the Intellectuals, from the Prison Notebooks, outlines Gramsci's
1039400	1042960	call for socialists to subvert morality-creating cultural institutions.
1042960	1043960	He replied to me with,
1043960	1044960	Provide a quotation!
1044960	1048080	In that essay, which is mostly descriptive with few prescriptions, Gramsci says nothing
1048080	1049080	like that.
1049080	1052900	He then cites the summary of the essay provided by the translator, which basically says that
1052900	1057420	the working class can organically create its own intellectual to counter the bourgeois
1057420	1062820	intellectual, provide their own ideas outside of bourgeois control, and begin to build counter-hegemony.
1062820	1067380	He then cites Gramsci describing his own newspaper's goal of creating that new type of working
1067380	1070180	class intellectual, even highlighting this passage.
1070180	1074020	One of the most important characteristics of any group that is developing towards dominance
1074020	1077660	is its struggle to assimilate and to conquer ideologically the traditional intellectuals.
1077660	1081440	But this assimilation and conquest is made quicker and more efficacious the more the
1081440	1086140	group in question succeeds in simultaneously elaborating its own organic intellectuals.
1086140	1089360	Now, I don't know why Sock Dunleff thought this was an own.
1089360	1093380	Gramsci is describing a portion of Lenin's dual power theory here, where socialists should
1093380	1097340	build up working class alternatives to the various components of bourgeois society.
1097340	1100660	Gramsci is only talking about intellectuals, but Lenin applied dual power theory to all
1100660	1104260	of society's institutions, so that these alternatives are ready to go when bourgeois
1104260	1106020	society falls to the revolution.
1106020	1110740	In this quote, Gramsci is describing how a dominant group maintains ideological control
1110740	1115260	over society using their intellectuals, and so a subversive group has to create their
1115260	1119060	own intellectuals with their own ideas as part of countering the effect.
1119060	1123460	Sock Dunleff is technically correct when he says that even though Gramsci describes what's
1123460	1126980	going on here, he doesn't take the final step and explicitly come out and say that's
1126980	1128620	what socialists should do.
1128620	1130500	For example, at the beginning of the essay, he writes,
1130500	1134740	The capitalist entrepreneur creates alongside himself the industrial technician, the specialist
1134740	1138500	in political economy, the organizers of a new culture, of a new legal system, etc.
1138500	1141980	He doesn't end the statement with, And we should build up our own counters to do this,
1141980	1144620	because, um, remember the fascist guards looking over his shoulder?
1144620	1149300	The Prison Notebooks mainly consists of detailed insights into how, in Gramsci's view, the
1149300	1153740	bourgeois delicately controlled the various knobs and levers of society to keep themselves
1153740	1154740	in power.
1154740	1158980	It is only due to circumstance that he was required to leave the final step of the revolutionary
1158980	1168620	process, the call to act on this understanding, in the hands of the reader.
1168620	1173020	The main contribution that Antonio Gramsci made to socialist theory in The Prison Notebooks
1173020	1175200	is the concept of cultural hegemony.
1175200	1176700	Is it hegemony or hegemony?
1176700	1178140	I'll use hegemony.
1178140	1181560	Marxian socialism had a predictive element to it, that the socialist revolution would
1181560	1185540	inevitably happen, just as feudalism had collapsed into capitalism before it, as a
1185540	1187700	natural part of the march of progress.
1187700	1192840	By the early 20th century, it was widely adopted by socialists that Marx was wrong about this.
1192840	1195840	Socialism split into a number of post-Marxist schools of thought.
1195840	1199320	One that we've spoken about extensively on this channel was Sorelianism, where George
1199320	1203820	Sorel planted the seeds for fascism through his belief that a revolution against international
1203820	1206160	capital had to be a nationalist one.
1206160	1210180	Leninism, meanwhile, consists of Lenin's belief that a group of socialist intellectuals,
1210180	1214320	known as the vanguard, had to control the state and reeducate the people with the proper
1214320	1217900	political consciousness before any true socialism could appear.
1217900	1220000	Gramsci in thought, however, is different.
1220000	1223740	Gramsci believed that the reason the workers did not revolt against the bourgeois, as Marx
1223740	1227380	had predicted, is because they were subsumed in bourgeois culture.
1227380	1231460	The bourgeois propagated its own values into the minds of the proletariat in the form of
1231460	1235900	what we call common sense, making them act out cultural values that were against their
1235900	1237500	own material interests.
1237500	1241500	A simplistic example is, you might be told as a child that stealing from a shop is immoral
1241500	1243780	for a number of reasons, religious, economic.
1243780	1247200	But Gramscians would argue that it's only immoral because the bourgeois wants you to
1247200	1251160	think it's immoral, because they have something to gain if you don't steal.
1251160	1255660	In this view, all of the values of a capitalist society serve to prevent a workers' revolution,
1255660	1260140	while the society in question presents those values as normal or natural or obvious when
1260140	1262420	they are in fact imposed.
1262420	1266380	Gramsci identified the two halves that propagate this bourgeois culture, using two different
1266380	1267380	methods.
1267380	1271120	The first he called political society, the police, the army, the legal system, the government.
1271120	1274420	These institutions spread bourgeois culture through force.
1274420	1278040	These are the components of society that will come for you if you don't accept and live
1278040	1279620	by bourgeois culture.
1279620	1283900	The second he called civil society, the family, the schools, the churches, the unions, the
1283900	1284900	media.
1284900	1289060	These institutions don't use force, but they secure consent from the people through a combination
1289060	1291020	of incentives and social pressures.
1291020	1295180	In this way, the people spread the same bourgeois culture to each other that prevents them from
1295180	1296980	revolting against capitalism.
1296980	1300540	Gramsci believed that working class intellectuals, separate from the traditional intellectuals
1300540	1304960	of bourgeois society, needed to develop an entirely separate value system and ideology
1304960	1309020	in order to be able to combat the cultural hegemony the bourgeois held over society.
1309020	1312180	This development of an alternative morality and culture to challenge bourgeois hegemony
1312180	1316380	is what Gramsci called the War of Position, contrasted with the War of Maneuver, which
1316380	1317700	is a direct revolution.
1317700	1322020	Gramsci theorized that in Russia, a war of position to dismantle bourgeois hegemony was
1322020	1325940	not necessary before a war of maneuver could take place, because Russia's bourgeois had
1325940	1328040	never actually achieved any hegemony.
1328040	1332000	This was not the case in more industrialized, centralized, and urbanized states, making
1332000	1335840	the development of alternative culture and morality a necessity before any direct revolution
1335840	1337180	could be successful.
1337180	1341980	Gramsci specifically described this process with the word subversive, and how even peasants
1341980	1347140	who had not yet fostered any class consciousness were still reflexively subversive when encountering
1347140	1349380	civil servants working for the modern state.
1349380	1352700	These peasants didn't have the education to understand the modern state, but they did
1352700	1357620	intuitively know that the local civil servant who came around was not somebody to be trusted.
1357620	1361660	This instinctive reflex was, for Gramsci, indicative of the underlying desire for the
1361660	1364260	working class to be free of bourgeois hegemony.
1364260	1367700	In one of his newspaper articles, Gramsci also chided Mussolini for claiming that the
1367700	1369820	latter could ever be considered truly subversive.
1369820	1373300	From a modern perspective, that's actually quite strange, listening to socialists and
1373300	1377700	fascists argue over who the true subversive is, wanting to claim the label because it's
1377700	1378700	considered positive.
1378700	1382000	Nowadays, both of them try desperately to ditch the title, and claim that the other
1382000	1384040	is the one who's lying constantly.
1384040	1387580	Here's where we get to what is, for me personally, the really interesting bit.
1387580	1391200	In the Twitter thread, Sock Done Left claims that the conservative intellectual ecosystem
1391200	1395580	is broken, that all of these right-wing creators and talking heads are using this false Gramsci
1395580	1399520	quote to spread the idea that socialists have the goal of infiltrating institutions to turn
1399520	1403840	the culture socialist as a prelude to a revolution, the war of position before the war of maneuver,
1403840	1408080	and that this is the justification the right is leaning on to seize the institutions back.
1408080	1411520	And where Sock Done Left is correct is not only that the Gramsci quote is false, but
1411560	1415800	also that Gramsci never explicitly said, seized the institutions and cultural production and
1415800	1419600	turned them socialist, again due to the fact that he was writing in a fascist prison.
1419600	1422040	Most of the prison notebooks are descriptions, not prescriptions.
1422040	1426420	It's Gramsci outlining what he sees the bourgeois doing to establish cultural hegemony,
1426420	1429240	and what working-class intellectuals could do to create counter-hegemony.
1429240	1433160	He never actually says, do it, just like a person who doxxes somebody never actually
1433160	1436080	says go harass them, but we can read between the lines.
1436080	1440240	But Gramsci did make some overt prescriptions that slipped by the censors.
1440240	1444320	The most important one was that although the working-class intellectuals were tasked
1444320	1448180	with the creation of a new type of education, morality, and culture, they were actually
1448180	1452400	not instructed to introduce Marxist ideology into the consciousness of the proletariat
1452400	1457060	as a set of foreign notions, but instead they were to co-opt existing intellectual activities
1457060	1460880	of the working class and make them inherently critical of the status quo.
1460880	1464720	It's possible that Gramsci did not advocate for direct Marxist education out of fear of
1464720	1468960	the censors, hoping that any future comrades would also be able to read between the lines.
1468960	1472440	But it's also possible that Gramsci did not believe that direct propagandizing would
1472440	1476880	be effective, that a true awakening of class consciousness would require dismantling bourgeois
1476880	1482240	hegemony first, and letting the working-class's natural subversiveness blossom all on its
1482240	1483240	own.
1483240	1486640	But all of this is a far cry from saying that the rightoids of today are lying grifters
1486640	1490140	who don't care about the truth, that their intellectual ecosystem is broken.
1490140	1495360	Sock Dunn Left explicitly states in the thread that rightist pundits use a fake Gramsci quote
1495360	1500280	to justify the existence of a secret communist conspiracy, but then in his article he says
1500280	1505160	that Gramsci and those socialists descended from him argued for socialists attempting
1505160	1509720	to construct dual power structures to win the coercion battle along with gradually moving
1509720	1512560	culture production leftward to win the consent battle.
1512560	1517640	Sock Dunn Left literally says right here that what the right wing says Gramsci believed
1517640	1521680	in that fake quote is actually what Gramsci believed.
1521680	1525040	Conservatives love to trot out these quotes in order to suggest that leftists are engaged
1525040	1527920	in a grand conspiracy to take over institutions from within.
1527920	1529440	Yeah, but that's true though.
1529440	1530440	Gramsci wrote it.
1530440	1534480	You even say in your article that you actually want there to be a secret cabal of leftists
1534480	1536240	controlling everything.
1536240	1539840	Leftists are engaged in a conspiracy to take over institutions from within.
1539840	1543400	They may not be as effective as you want them to be, or as the right says that they are,
1543400	1546320	but putting aside the effectiveness, does the effort exist?
1546320	1549200	The only possible answer to that is yes.
1556040	1561360	Lots of people who talk about critical race theory online have no idea what it is.
1561360	1564800	Those few people who have read the writings of critical theorists, however, all report
1564800	1567960	that they are directly descended from Gramscian socialism.
1567960	1571400	Sargon did something like 10 videos going over the various components of the critical
1571400	1574880	race theory bible, and those are worthwhile videos to watch for sure.
1574880	1578560	But I found personally that when I was watching them I wasn't actually learning very much
1578560	1581680	— sorry Sargon — I was instead remembering it.
1581680	1585000	Because for me, this is all stuff that I had already personally encountered and kind
1585000	1586000	of forgotten about.
1586000	1591280	In the first year university course, Introduction to Critical Theory, that I took back in 2007.
1591280	1595240	Here's my textbook from that class, Critical Theory Today by Lois Tyson, second edition,
1595240	1598160	though I understand there's been several newer versions of the book since I've graduated.
1598160	1601400	Let's trace the genealogy of the post-Gramscian socialist movement.
1601400	1605640	The Hungarian thinker Georgi Lukas is one of the most influential philosophers of what
1605640	1607500	would eventually become critical theory.
1607500	1610080	He had a similar intellectual development as Antonio Gramsci.
1610080	1614580	He went off to university and discovered the philosophies of Marx, Sorel, Hegel, Kierkegaard,
1614580	1615580	and Gentile.
1615580	1619120	The Russian Revolution of 1917 inspired him to become a committed Marxist, and though
1619120	1625040	he was somewhat critical of Leninism, he nonetheless became a commissar in the short-lived 1919
1625040	1628760	Hungarian Soviet Republic and committed atrocities you'd expect from that station.
1628760	1633160	After that state was crushed in the Hungarian Civil War, Lukas fled to Italy.
1633160	1637560	Gramsci and Lukas were in Vienna at the same time in the 1920s, and though they never met,
1637560	1642120	Gramsci's ideas were introduced to Lukas through a mutual comrade, the Belgian-Russian
1642120	1646160	anarchist Victor Serge, who really has nothing to his name other than getting Gramsci's
1646160	1647160	ideas out there.
1647160	1650560	Serge moved back to Russia, opposed Lenin, was exiled, and died.
1650560	1654920	Lukas traveled to the Soviet Union in 1933 to take up a spot in a Moscow university and
1654920	1658920	was not allowed to leave, first due to the outbreak of the Second World War and, secondly,
1658920	1660960	due to being exiled in Stalin's Great Purge.
1660960	1665600	By the time he returned to Hungary in 1945, it was again a Soviet state, and he joined
1665600	1668740	the Hungarian Communist Party, taking on an administrative role.
1668740	1672500	Though Lukas was ultimately critical of Stalin and the Soviet regimes of Eastern Europe as
1672500	1677600	not being true socialism, he kept those beliefs under wraps until after Stalin's death.
1677600	1681960	He spent his remaining years advocating for socialism, but critical of its current form.
1681960	1686260	Georgi Lukas contributed a lot to political theory and history, I've only just skimmed
1686260	1691320	over his biography, but what concerns us today is his involvement in the Frankfurt School.
1691320	1695560	The Frankfurt School began as a physical school, the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt.
1695560	1698120	But it eventually became a school of thought.
1698120	1702000	Lukas was one of the school's founders and published a work that is just as influential
1702000	1705760	as Gramsci's prison notebooks, History and Class Consciousness.
1705760	1710240	In this book, Lukas argues that Marxism is not only a theory of political economy that
1710240	1714400	improves upon its bourgeois predecessors by advancing the dialectic, nor is it only a
1714400	1719040	scientific sociology like the natural sciences, but it is also a critique, a self-conscious
1719040	1720780	transformation of society.
1720780	1724680	The old Marxist purists argued that Marxism made philosophy obsolete.
1724680	1729480	But these new Marxists, commonly called Western Marxists like Lukas and Gramsci, claimed that
1729480	1735000	Marxism preserves the truths of philosophy until revolution can transform them into reality.
1735000	1739900	This process was explored by Marx, but was popularized by Lukas using the term reification.
1739900	1744380	To reify something means to take something that is abstract and make it a real object.
1744380	1749060	To use a modern comparison, what objectification is to people, reification is to ideas.
1749060	1753460	The Frankfurt School was heavily influenced by the rise of fascism in Europe in two ways.
1753460	1756880	First, the intellectuals of the school applied their interpretations of Marxist political
1756880	1761580	theory to try and explain why fascism, and not socialism, had been the result of widespread
1761580	1763060	working-class revolt.
1763060	1766820	Secondly, when Germany became too unsafe for them to continue their work as the Nazis rose
1766820	1770460	to power, the school was moved to the United States, along with most of its members, though
1770460	1774100	Georgi Lukas was a notable exception who remained behind in Europe.
1774100	1777540	Everyone actually involved in the Frankfurt School is notable enough that they each deserve
1777540	1781380	a video in their own right, especially Herbert Marcuse, another person Sargon's covered
1781380	1785260	over at the Lotus Eaters, and there just isn't enough time to talk about them all right now.
1785260	1789060	But the leader of the Frankfurt School in America, the German sociologist Max Horkheimer,
1789060	1793740	wrote in his 1937 work, Traditional and Critical Theory, that critical theory as an intellectual
1793740	1799420	tradition was a social critique meant to affect political change and foster intellectual enlightenment,
1799420	1802780	an idea that is likely descended from Gramsci through Lukas.
1802780	1807200	Meanwhile, the Frankfurt School had influenced a community of French intellectuals who, while
1807200	1810960	not a part of the school, were still Western Marxists and critical theorists.
1810960	1814760	Jean-Paul Sartre, a prominent existentialist, his partner Simone de Beauvoir, who pretty
1814760	1819400	much kickstarted feminism's second wave, with her 1949 book, The Second Sex, Jacques Derrida,
1819400	1823340	who developed the philosophy of deconstruction, Michael Foucault, probably the most famous
1823340	1824720	postmodernist of all time.
1824720	1828320	Again, I've got a lot to say about each of these people, and now is not the time, but
1828320	1832800	even a cursory glance will recognize the Gramsci-ian influence in their philosophy.
1832800	1836820	They all, in their own way, advocated for the critiquing of society through its institutions
1836820	1840600	to subvert hegemonic culture and create space for change.
1840600	1844480	Probably the most blatant Gramsci-ian activist of this period was Rudi Duchké, which is
1844480	1848820	ironic because Duchké never actually mentioned Gramsci at all, in any of his writing, but
1848820	1852900	like everyone else, during his time at university, he was heavily influenced by pretty much everyone
1852900	1853900	I just listed.
1853900	1856540	All the thinkers of the Frankfurt School, all the French critical theorists, Georgi
1856540	1861020	Lukas and Mao Zedong and Lenin, and it's in Duchké's ideas that things really begin
1861020	1862020	to take shape.
1862020	1865740	Duchké coined the phrase, the long march through the institutions, to describe the
1865740	1869860	necessity for socialist revolutionaries to subvert capitalist domination of society
1869860	1874620	by taking up positions from within these institutions and slowly turning them towards socialism.
1874620	1878340	By the way, even as Sokhton Left said that conservatives were grifters for thinking that
1878340	1882620	this was a socialist goal, he cited Duchké in the article saying that this was his goal.
1882620	1886660	It is unreal how these people will piss on your face and tell you it's raining.
1886660	1890420	Duchké took the phrase, long march through the institutions, from Mao Zedong's Long
1890420	1894100	March, which was a strategic retreat that the Chinese Red Army undertook in order to
1894100	1896460	evade the pursuit of the Chinese nationalists.
1896460	1901300	It was a grueling event in the Chinese Communist Party's history, covering over 9,000 kilometers
1901300	1905340	across 370 days through the toughest terrain of Western China.
1905340	1909120	And by the end of it, Mao Zedong had been cemented in the minds of the Chinese Communists
1909120	1910820	as their undisputed leader.
1910820	1915300	Duchké's use of the phrase, long march, was meant to evoke the idea of a protracted,
1915300	1920060	bitter struggle against capitalist forces seeking them out, and how evasion and subversion
1920060	1923920	across a large enough time frame would lead to a prestigious victory.
1923920	1928160	Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School explicitly supported Rudi Duchké's idea of a long
1928160	1932680	march through the institutions, writing in a counter-revolution and revolt, working against
1932680	1937080	the established institutions while working within them, but not simply by boring from
1937080	1941440	within, rather by doing the job, learning how to program and read computers, how to
1941440	1945720	teach at all levels of education, how to use mass media, how to organize production, how
1945720	1950800	to design, etc., and at the same time preserving one's own consciousness in working with
1950800	1951800	others.
1951800	1955000	This march includes the concentrated effort to build up counter-institutions.
1955000	1959300	They have long been an aim of the movement, but the lack of funds was greatly responsible
1959300	1961520	for their weakness and their inferior quality.
1961520	1963080	They must be made competitive.
1963080	1966320	This is especially important for the development of radical free media.
1966320	1970880	The fact that the radical left has no equal access to the great chains of information
1970880	1974240	and indoctrination is largely responsible for its isolation.
1974240	1978200	Similarly with the development of independent schools and free universities.
1978200	1982520	They can be competitive, that is to say apt to counteract establishment education, only
1982520	1987040	where they fill a vacuum of where their quality is not only different but also superior.
1987040	1991240	The collection of large funds for the operation of effective counter-institutions requires
1991240	1992240	compromises.
1992240	1996780	The time of the wholesale rejection of the liberals has passed, or has not yet come.
1996780	2000820	Radicalism has much to gain from the legitimate protest against the war, inflation, unemployment,
2000820	2005240	from the defense of civil rights, even perhaps from a lesser evil in local elections.
2005240	2009360	The ground for the building of a united front is shifting and sometimes dirty, but it is
2009360	2010360	there.
2010360	2013400	I have stressed the key role which the universities play in the present period.
2013400	2017120	They can still function as institutions for the training of counter-cadres.
2017120	2021540	The restructuring necessary for the attainment of this goal means more than decisive student
2021540	2024280	participation and non-authoritarian learning.
2024280	2028440	Though Dutschke had no knowledge of Gramsci, Marcuse certainly did due to his involvement
2028440	2029520	in the Frankfurt School.
2029520	2032920	And though Dutschke would ultimately have little effect on any socialist movement, suffering
2032920	2037240	from a seizure while in the bath and drowning at the age of 39, Marcuse would adopt the
2037240	2041540	long march through the institutions into his own work and carry it forward with the rest
2041540	2055880	of the Frankfurt School.
2055880	2060040	In the book The Critical Turn in Education, from Marxist critique to post-structuralist
2060040	2064080	feminism to critical theories of race, it's described that the Frankfurt School entered
2064080	2069080	into a period of decline correlated with neo-conservatives becoming the dominant American rightist faction,
2069080	2074280	beating out paleoconservatives and libertarians in the right-wing civil war of the late 1970s.
2074280	2078240	As a result, critical theory as a discipline began to slowly fracture into separate strains
2078240	2079720	over the years.
2079720	2083480	Postcolonial theory, queer theory, feminist theory, and most famously, at least in modern
2083480	2084880	terms, critical race theory.
2084880	2085880	I was lucky.
2085880	2087600	My textbook included a section on all of them.
2087600	2091640	Yes, critical race theory is one of the right-wing's current boogeymen, though the trans stuff
2091640	2093920	seems to be currently overtaking it for the top spot.
2093920	2097520	And before you ask, yes, there is a form of critical trans theory too.
2097520	2098960	It's included in queer theory.
2098960	2102340	And honestly, all of these different branches function pretty much exactly the same way.
2102340	2105920	And they can all have their lineage traced back through the Frankfurt School, to Herbert
2105920	2109920	Marcuse, to Max Horkheimer, to Georgi Lucas, to Antonio Gramsci.
2109920	2113280	The core Gramsciian idea still remains in critical theory.
2113280	2117220	In order to subvert bourgeois hegemony, you must construct counter-hegemony.
2117220	2121220	This means subversive intellectuals who create alternative morality and produce alternative
2121220	2122520	cultural output.
2122520	2127020	These would form into organic-appearing countercultures that would drum up revolutionary fervor in
2127020	2128940	the mind of the normal working-class person.
2128940	2132620	And even if it didn't, it would leave them highly critical of their own society and weak
2132620	2133620	to further propaganda.
2133620	2137560	It's pretty much the same thing that Yuri Bezmenov described the Soviet Union doing
2137560	2140740	through infiltration of Western academia, but with one big difference.
2140740	2145100	The Soviet active measures program was designed to demoralize an enemy population with planted
2145100	2146100	agents.
2146100	2148740	The critical theorists, meanwhile, weren't planted by the Soviets.
2148740	2153420	They engage in subversive action in the hope of fostering a homegrown revolution not beholden
2153420	2155060	to foreign socialists.
2155060	2158300	This book is Critical Race Theory, the key writings that form the movement.
2158300	2162980	It's a long, boring, arcane tome that I am certain most conservatives have never even
2162980	2165780	read despite constantly citing this movement.
2165780	2166780	But it is important.
2166780	2170020	It's a collection of essays compiled by Kimberle Crenshaw, a civil rights advocate
2170020	2172820	and the creator of what we now know as intersectional theory.
2172820	2177820	She coined the term intersectionality in 1989 as a way to describe the oppression of African-American
2177820	2178820	women.
2178820	2182380	Crenshaw noticed that oppression based on race and oppression based on sex were separate
2182380	2183380	but intertwined.
2183380	2186780	And in the wake of the dissolution of the Frankfurt School in America and the fracturing
2186780	2191040	of critical theory as a discipline into separate groups, she found that she needed new language
2191040	2193860	to describe the intersection of race and sex.
2193860	2198240	Though the majority of prominent black activists of the second half of the 20th century were
2198240	2203520	all students of the original American Frankfurt School members, most notably Herbert Marcuse
2203520	2207080	mentoring Angela Davis, Kimberle Crenshaw was not one of them.
2207080	2211600	Crenshaw came to the idea of intersectionality after reading the writing of black activists
2211600	2216640	not descended from the Frankfurt School, like Sojourner Truth and Anna Julia Hayward Cooper.
2216640	2220800	Crenshaw observed during her time at university that the intersection of race and gender was
2220800	2225480	not well understood and that rather than the overlapping oppressions simply stacking up,
2225480	2228680	gender gave racial oppression a unique dynamic and vice versa.
2228680	2232600	However, Kimberle Crenshaw would eventually work with descendants of the Frankfurt School
2232600	2235160	like Angela Davis and they would influence each other.
2235160	2238720	Crenshaw would give them intersectionality and they would give in return Gramsci's
2238720	2239720	cultural hegemony.
2239720	2242640	Also, I know I'm dropping a lot of names in here right now, they really all do deserve
2242640	2244440	a deep dive and it can't be today.
2244440	2248760	The TLDR of Angela Davis is that she's a black activist whose legally owned guns were
2248760	2253000	given to the perpetrators of an armed takeover of a courtroom and the execution of a judge
2253000	2257480	in California in 1970, as well as a communist who believed that the prisoners of the Soviet
2257480	2262680	Union and its satellite states deserved to be purged because they were Zionist fascists
2262680	2264120	and opponents of socialism.
2264120	2265880	Yes, those were her words.
2265880	2269600	She has a long history of supporting political violence, repressive governments, and genuinely
2269600	2273900	awful organizations in the name of feminism, socialism, and black liberation.
2273900	2278120	In the modern day, she has taken on the public persona of being like any other aged black
2278120	2281280	activist, her violent past having largely been forgotten.
2281320	2286320	Meanwhile, Kimberle Crenshaw's area of expertise was in law and she applied Gramsci's cultural
2286320	2289160	hegemony to that sphere, creating critical legal theory.
2289160	2293440	She theorized that laws exist to maintain society's status quo and that in so far
2293440	2297220	as that status quo is bigoted, the law serves to codify that bigotry.
2297220	2301160	In this way, the liberals' colorblindness will always be racist, in Crenshaw's view
2301160	2305560	anyway, because that colorblindness must necessarily insist on an equality that doesn't exist.
2305560	2309320	For Crenshaw, if the law treats everyone equally without prejudice, then it is blind to the
2309320	2313680	reason as to why, say, more black people are locked up per capita than white people
2313680	2314680	in America.
2314680	2317440	And for Crenshaw, the solution to that problem is a Gramsciian one.
2317440	2320120	Subvert the process and develop counter hegemony.
2320120	2323780	Critical race theory and critical gender theory and queer theory, all of it, it is all descended
2323780	2324960	from this origin.
2324960	2328680	This is why so many leftists will say, why are you so pissed that CRT is being taught
2328680	2329680	in schools?
2329680	2330680	It's just a legal thing.
2330680	2331680	You don't even know what CRT is.
2331680	2333820	And yeah, a lot of conservatives don't know what CRT is.
2333820	2335920	But this is why you should be pissed.
2335920	2336920	It's anti-liberal.
2336920	2341480	Therefore, critical race theory, being Gramsciian in origin, posits that in America, bourgeois
2341480	2346540	hegemony is white hegemony, that countercultural action to foster liberation must be through
2346540	2350880	black culture, and that liberalism's attempt to create a neutral playing field through
2350880	2356840	colorblind value-neutral policies only serves to reinforce white hegemony by not explicitly
2356840	2358520	privileging black people.
2358520	2363260	Kimberle Crenshaw has no problem in her own writing making this explicitly clear.
2363260	2367140	In her article, Race, Reform, and Retrenchment, she writes,
2367140	2371460	Oppressed people sometimes advance by creating ideological and political crisis, but the
2371460	2376700	form of the crisis-producing challenge must reflect the institutional logic of the system.
2376700	2380860	Gramsci called the struggle a war of position, and he regarded it as the most appropriate
2380860	2383380	strategy for change in Western societies.
2383380	2387960	According to Gramsci, direct challenges to the dominant class accomplish little if ideology
2387960	2391860	plays such a central role in establishing authority that the legitimacy of the dominant
2391860	2393420	regime is not challenged.
2393420	2397980	Consequently, the challenges in such societies is to create a counter-hegemony by maneuvering
2397980	2402080	within and expanding the dominant ideology to embrace the potential for change.
2402080	2406380	Both critical race theorists and intersectional feminists are descended from Crenshaw's
2406380	2411220	work, most notably in the online space, Robin DiAngelo and her white fragility nonsense.
2411220	2415100	But there's tons of people out there who view subversive action against liberal society
2415100	2418860	as an a priori good and not just in terms of critical race theory.
2418860	2422560	For example, you can look at critical queer theory and find people talking about how earlier
2422560	2428180	waves of gay and trans activism were assimilationist in nature because they focused on trying to
2428180	2432980	make hegemonic culture accept them through things like normalizing gay marriage or appealing
2432980	2436780	to the stereotypical hyper-femininity of a trans woman, when what they should have been
2436780	2441660	doing is engaging in the most disruptive, degenerate behaviors imaginable in order to
2441660	2445020	foster a counterculture that can oppose bourgeois hegemony.
2445020	2448500	But that is a whole extra can of worms I'm going to have to cover another day.
2448500	2452620	The point is, critical theory as a movement, as well as the Frankfurt School before it,
2452620	2456700	view the liberals' attempt to build a neutral space where ideas can be debated and considered
2456700	2461140	as a weakness that socialists can exploit in order to begin the process of tearing liberalism
2461140	2462140	down.
2462140	2464100	And all you have to do is read their writing to see it.
2464100	2465100	Crenshaw wrote,
2465100	2469000	Black people can afford it neither to resign themselves to nor to attack frontally the
2469000	2472000	legitimacy and the incoherence of the dominant ideology.
2472000	2476100	The subordinate position of blacks in this society make it unlikely that African Americans
2476100	2480300	will realize gains through the kind of direct challenge to the legitimacy of American liberal
2480300	2483500	ideology that is now being waged by critical scholars.
2483500	2487780	On the other hand, delegitimating race consciousness would be directly relevant to black needs,
2487780	2492180	and this strategy will sometimes require the pragmatic use of liberal ideology.
2492180	2495980	Marcuse said something similar in that long passage earlier from Counter-Revolution and
2495980	2496980	Revolt that,
2496980	2500820	The time of the wholesale rejection of the liberals has passed or is not yet to come.
2500820	2504760	That protests against the war, inflation, and unemployment from a point of view of civil
2504760	2509720	rights could be tolerated as a tactical deployment of liberal ideals to be used and discarded
2509720	2512120	later, like how elections are a lesser evil.
2512120	2516560	Critical theorists use their analytical method to destabilize liberal systems and prime them
2516560	2517560	for revolution.
2517560	2522040	They only appeal to liberal values and ethics insofar as it will help them achieve this
2522040	2533840	goal.
2533840	2537960	In case it's not yet clear that Sock Dunn Left is talking out of his gaping asshole
2537960	2539960	for his entire article when he says,
2539960	2543840	Conservatives are lying and grifting because they claimed Gramsci said something he didn't
2543840	2547360	say, even though socialists still believe in all of the underlying ethics anyway.
2547360	2551480	I hope this is the final nail in the coffin regarding any assumptions of good faith in
2551480	2555120	his part, or at the very least, that he actually reads any of the theory that he cites.
2555120	2558820	There is a clear lineage from Antonio Gramsci to the present day, and the craziest thing
2558820	2563520	about it all is, when I took that 2007 class, this stuff wasn't exactly kept secret, but
2563560	2565240	it wasn't being shouted from the rooftops either.
2565240	2568840	My professor made it clear that this was very serious, very subversive stuff, and while
2568840	2573600	it wasn't to be kept under wraps, it was meant to make us critical theorists.
2573600	2577320	He was clear about viewing his class as a political project, his contribution to the
2577320	2578320	creation of counter-hegemony.
2578320	2583200	It's only after my generation, the millennials, left university, entered the workforce, and
2583200	2587240	began to implement this shit, that wider society began to take notice, and the subversives
2587240	2588240	began to panic.
2588240	2589840	Here's one example of what I mean.
2589840	2593660	If you go to the Wikipedia article on Cultural Marxism, you'll get this passage.
2593660	2598340	The term Cultural Marxism refers to a far-right anti-Semitic conspiracy theory which claims
2598340	2603120	that Western Marxism is the basis of continuing academic and intellectual efforts to subvert
2603120	2604200	Western culture.
2604200	2608920	The conspiracy theory misrepresents the Frankfurt School as being responsible for modern progressive
2608920	2612720	movements, identity politics, and political correctness, claiming that there is an ongoing
2612720	2617420	and intentional subversion of Western society via a planned culture war that undermines
2617420	2621320	the Christian values of traditionalist conservatism and seeks to replace them with the culturally
2621320	2623520	liberal values of the 1960s.
2623520	2628260	Although similarities with the Nazi propaganda term Cultural Bolshevism has been noted, the
2628260	2632500	contemporary conspiracy theory originated in the United States during the 1990s.
2632500	2636700	Originally found only on the far-right political fringe, the term began to enter mainstream
2636700	2639460	discourse in the 2010s and is now found globally.
2639460	2644060	The conspiracy theory of a Marxist culture war is promoted by right-wing politicians,
2644060	2647420	fundamentalist religious leaders, political commentators in mainstream print and television
2647420	2652000	media, and white supremacist terrorists, and has been described as a foundational element
2652000	2653340	of the alt-right worldview.
2653340	2655700	Now, to me, this doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
2655700	2661660	In fact, it seems to be an outright lie because my professor, back in 2007, explicitly referred
2661660	2664220	to what we were talking about as Cultural Marxism.
2664220	2667520	It was not the name of some false conspiracy theory back then.
2667520	2669920	It was what underpinned critical theory.
2669920	2673860	We learned to attack aspects of hegemonic culture, mainly pop culture, let's be honest.
2673860	2678760	It was an intro-level course, through media criticism meant to deconstruct and demoralize,
2678760	2683140	with the long-term purpose being the creation of a space where an alternative, and preferably
2683140	2685100	socialist, counterculture could form.
2685100	2689260	The Wikipedia article frames this as if it's false and anti-Semitic and only neo-Nazis
2689260	2693740	believe it or something, but in my experience, this is exactly what it is, and back then
2693740	2696100	they had no problem just outright saying it.
2696100	2699740	What's really interesting is, if you look at the Cultural Marxism Wikipedia article
2699740	2702220	from 2014, it's more or less accurate.
2702220	2706100	Cultural Marxism is an offshoot of Marxism that conceives of culture as central to the
2706100	2708880	legitimization of oppression, in addition to economic factors.
2708880	2713560	An outgrowth of Western Marxism, especially from Antonio Gramsci in the Frankfurt School,
2713560	2717720	Cultural Marxism argues that what appears as traditional cultural phenomenon intrinsic
2717720	2722380	to Western society, for instance capitalism, nationalism, the nuclear family, gender roles,
2722380	2726900	race, and other forms of cultural identity, serve to justify and maintain hierarchy.
2726900	2731980	Cultural Marxists use Marxist methods to make it possible to criticize what appears natural,
2731980	2732980	but is in fact ideological.
2732980	2737180	This is pretty much spot on, all of the writing I've referenced today shows it to be spot
2737180	2738180	on.
2738180	2739180	And you know what?
2739180	2743140	Other lesser known Wikipedia articles still reinforce this too, but the article that everyone's
2743140	2747020	been searching in the past few years, Cultural Marxism, is the one that's been changed
2747020	2748580	to try and hide the smoke.
2748580	2753260	The contents of the old Cultural Marxism page have just been moved to a new heading in Wikipedia
2753260	2755660	called Marxist Cultural Analysis.
2755660	2759260	This really is some we're not doing it and it's good that it's happening shit.
2759260	2763700	On this page, the claim is made that the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory is an influential
2763700	2768660	discourse in the far right without any clear relationship to Marxist Cultural Analysis.
2768660	2771740	On the current Cultural Marxism page, a similar claim is made.
2771740	2776100	Scholarly analysis of the conspiracy theory has concluded that the Cultural Marxism conspiracy
2776100	2778380	theory has no basis in fact.
2778380	2782420	Both of these passages cite the article, Who's Afraid of the Frankfurt School?
2782420	2786580	Cultural Marxism as an Antisemitic Conspiracy Theory, by Joanne Braun from the Journal of
2786580	2787580	Social Justice.
2787780	2792300	Okay, now this sounds like some, we've investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong shit
2792300	2793300	too.
2793300	2795140	Of course, we should give the devil his due.
2795140	2797920	I read the article and it's not very good.
2797920	2801900	The article supports its claim that Cultural Marxism is an antisemitic conspiracy theory
2801900	2806460	by focusing on three specific proponents of the theory and claiming that because they
2806460	2810040	are antisemitic, the theory must also be antisemitic.
2810040	2814180	These three people are Kevin Macdonald, William S. Lind, and Paul Gottfried.
2814180	2816700	Regarding Kevin Macdonald, Braun is just correct.
2816700	2818220	He is antisemitic, seemingly to the core.
2818220	2821700	He's an evolutionary psychology professor, but he's most well known for a trilogy of
2821700	2825980	books called The Culture of Critique, where he uses his EvoPsych knowledge to claim that
2825980	2830860	Jews have evolved to undermine the societies in which they live as a form of biologically
2830860	2833020	fixed extreme in-group preference.
2833020	2835260	It's safe to say that this guy's a quack.
2835260	2839180	For William S. Lind, Braun even admits that he doesn't focus his critique of Cultural
2839180	2844260	Marxism on the Jews, but that his theory does have what she calls antisemitic dimensions.
2844260	2848140	One of these dimensions she's referring to is his use of the term globalist in his
2848140	2850020	objections to international capitalism.
2850020	2854460	Now, I personally don't know what that has to do with the Jews, because when I hear international
2854460	2858340	capitalists I don't think Jews, and I'm pretty sure that most people who use the word
2858340	2860900	globalist isn't thinking Jews either.
2860900	2865460	Nonetheless, Braun did dig up what she calls a Holocaust denial conference from back in
2865460	2870140	2002, where Lind made the remark that the people in the Frankfurt School were all Jews.
2870140	2873940	I looked into this event, and it seems to actually have been a paleoconservative conference.
2873940	2877180	There were definitely some Holocaust snares there, but Lind wasn't one of them, and
2877180	2879980	he explicitly pointed out that disagreement in his speech.
2879980	2883780	It may very well be the case that Lind is actually an antisemite, but not once does
2883780	2887880	Jewishness come up in his discussions of Cultural Marxism, and regardless of his motivations,
2887880	2890320	his critique is solid and factual.
2890320	2893340	Regarding Paul Gottfried, Braun's case is the weakest.
2893340	2898140	She admits that Gottfried is Jewish himself, and studied under Herbert Marcuse in his youth.
2898140	2902100	The only points she can muster against him are ultimately irrelevant character attacks,
2902100	2906540	like how he calls himself a paleoconservative, a term that he coined in fact, or how he mentored
2906540	2907540	Richard Spencer.
2907540	2911620	And Braun can't even make the emotional weight of that charge stick because she immediately
2911620	2914880	admits that Spencer is far more extreme than Gottfried.
2914880	2919340	But most importantly of all, even if all three of these men were vicious antisemites and
2919340	2924020	open goose-stepping Nazis and all the rest of it, that doesn't make Cultural Marxism
2924020	2928580	an alt-right antisemitic fascist conspiracy theory, nor does it prove it to be factually
2928580	2929580	incorrect.
2929580	2934340	The correct thing is still correct, even if people that you find distasteful believe
2934340	2935340	it.
2935340	2939920	Beyond these three men, Braun seems to have no real argument except, bad people believe
2939920	2941320	this, therefore it's wrong.
2941320	2944860	She claims that Anders Breivik was influenced by the idea to commit his shooting.
2944860	2948220	And while that's certainly bad, that doesn't disprove the idea.
2948220	2952540	She claims that Andrew Breitbart, Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, Alex Jones, and Brazilian
2952540	2956940	President Bolsonaro's son all believe in the theory, and that also doesn't disprove
2956940	2957940	it.
2957940	2962020	She also makes a list of very strange claims about Cultural Marxism, including that
2987940	2988940	you're a Nazi.
2988940	2989940	3.
2989940	2993900	It's the source of the view that leftists sometimes engage in pro-pedophile activism,
2993900	2998600	when according to Braun, this never happens, and it's only ever sex ed in schools and
2998600	3000000	accepting trans identities.
3000000	3003500	So if you think it's happening because, you know, you see it, you're a Nazi.
3003500	3006920	It's really incredible just how much she gaslights the reader here.
3006920	3010700	The entire foundation of this article is, bad people believe in this idea, therefore
3010700	3012980	it's false, and if you believe in it, you're bad too.
3012980	3014600	Which is pretty dogshit reasoning.
3014600	3019040	If you believe in any of this stuff, and there is proof for it happening at least sometimes,
3019040	3023260	then you're an alt-right neo-nazi cultural Marxist believer who hates the Jews, because
3023260	3025960	you believe in, you know, reality.
3025960	3026960	That's it.
3026960	3028080	That's the entire crux of her argument.
3028080	3032580	Joanne Braun is a professor at Gonzaga University in the Department of Leadership Studies.
3032580	3034980	You can actually get a leadership studies degree.
3034980	3037880	As far as I can tell, it's all about teaching you how to be a socially conscious middle
3037880	3039680	manager or HR department head.
3039680	3042200	Geez, and I thought my degree was worthless.
3042200	3046100	She is, surprise surprise, another academic descended from the Frankfurt School, and she
3046100	3050920	focuses specifically on critical hate studies and intersections of religion and socialism.
3050920	3054280	And normally I would not get into this because it's not relevant, fuck you if you think
3054280	3056280	I'm dog whistling here, but she's Jewish.
3056280	3060280	A Jewish intellectual who believes that everybody who disagrees with her politics is a Nazi
3060280	3064100	isn't somebody you can rely on for having an accurate view of this topic.
3064100	3068240	Not because she's Jewish, you weirdos, but because she's biased.
3068240	3072880	Cultural Marxism posits that leftist academics, artists, and activists, guided by Graham Shee's
3072880	3077340	theory of cultural hegemony, are subverting liberal institutions to create counter-hegemony,
3077340	3080360	and that their school of thought is the Frankfurt School.
3080360	3084360	Leftist academics, artists, and activists are not only saying that this is false, despite
3084360	3087920	the mountains of political writing to the contrary on the topic, but that you're an
3087920	3089280	anti-Semite if you believe it.
3089280	3093440	And the primary source justifying this belief that cultural Marxism is not only false, but
3093440	3098800	inherently anti-Semitic, is a leftist academic, artist, and activist, from the very same Frankfurt
3098800	3103240	School being critiqued, who serves to benefit, both personally and politically, if everyone
3103240	3106840	who believes in cultural Marxism is considered a Nazi by the public.
3106840	3111320	And this is the scholarly source that Wikipedia leans on to make the claim that cultural Marxism
3111320	3112840	is false and anti-Semitic.
3112840	3117640	I have never seen a more precise reason as to why people tend to not trust academics
3117640	3119160	and experts anymore.
3119160	3123120	Most people, including Braun, claim that cultural Marxism as a conspiracy theory is
3123120	3129400	a continuation of cultural Bolshevism or Judeo-Bolshevism, which actually was a real anti-Semitic conspiracy
3129400	3134680	theory in Nazi Germany that accused Jewish intellectuals of using art and music to subvert
3134680	3135820	German culture.
3135820	3140040	The Nazis called the works degenerate art and used them to justify censoring speech
3140040	3141040	and expression.
3141040	3144880	They believe the revolution in Russia was a Jewish plot, due primarily to the involvement
3144880	3148780	of Leon Trotsky, a Jewish-Ukrainian socialist revolutionary that we've talked about at
3148780	3150180	length in this channel before.
3150180	3153420	The Nazis believed that the Jews were the parasitic element that was destroying the
3153420	3158140	German working class, and that Soviet Russia was an example of that element's victory.
3158140	3161500	Judeo-Bolshevism is actually an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.
3161500	3165640	There is no evidence that Jewish intellectuals specifically used culture to undermine Germany.
3165640	3170100	There is no evidence that Jewish people were actually parasitizing the German working class.
3170100	3174420	There is no evidence that Bolsheviks in Russia were the culmination of a Jewish revolutionary
3174420	3175420	plot.
3175420	3180220	While Cultural Marxism follows the same basic form, revolutionaries using culture to subvert
3180220	3183900	hegemony, it has nothing else in common with Judeo-Bolshevism.
3183900	3188820	Neither Antonio Gramsci nor Giorgi Lukas nor Rudi Duchke were Jewish, and the Jewish origins
3188820	3191420	of the Frankfurt School have nothing to do with their motivations.
3191420	3195740	I didn't even mention it until this chapter of the video because it's not relevant.
3195740	3200780	But most importantly of all, unlike with Judeo-Bolshevism, there is ample amounts of evidence across
3200780	3206100	many different political theorists, spanning nearly 100 years now, that at least some socialists
3206100	3210060	view Cultural Marxism, or Gramsciian Socialism, or Critical Theory, or whatever you want to
3210060	3213300	call it, as a viable path forward for their revolution.
3213300	3217240	It seems to me that the people who are insisting that all of this stuff is just anti-Semitism,
3217240	3220960	and that you're a Nazi if you notice it's happening, are simply making a last-ditch
3220960	3227060	effort to try and preserve their growing counter-hegemony by shaming you into compliance through slander,
3227060	3231820	justified in their minds by a non-existent connection to a previous anti-Semitic conspiracy
3231820	3235100	theory that kinda looks similar if you really squint your eyes.
3235100	3239060	And honestly, if some people are just really triggered by calling it Cultural Marxism due
3239060	3242900	to this trumped-up connection, fine, call it Western Marxism, call it Marxist Cultural
3242900	3243900	Critique.
3243900	3247460	Hell, you can even call it the infinitely more neutral Institutional Capture, since
3247460	3251740	it's not like socialists are the only people who subvert liberal institutions when they
3251740	3252740	can.
3252740	3253740	The label doesn't matter.
3253740	3255200	What matters is, it's happening.
3255200	3270040	And as liberals, we need to be aware that it's happening.
3270040	3272040	And that brings us to the present day.
3272040	3273100	So let's recap.
3273100	3277320	Antonio Gramsci's experience with the factory workers' revolt, the Italian Socialist Party's
3277320	3280800	reluctance to support them, and Mussolini taking advantage of that situation, and winning
3280800	3284960	the popular support of the Italian working class, led him to develop a theory of bourgeois
3284960	3286320	cultural hegemony.
3286320	3290400	The proletariat would never reach class consciousness as long as the bourgeois continued to culturally
3290400	3291960	educate them against their own interests.
3291960	3295920	So the job of the socialist revolutionary was to undermine the culture and subversively
3295920	3299880	create countercultures to make the liberal state weak enough that a direct conflict could
3299880	3300880	be won.
3300880	3305200	Though Gramsci's prison notebooks did not actually get published until after his death,
3305200	3310400	he did share his ideas around Vienna's socialist scene, greatly influencing Georgi Lucas, who
3310400	3312720	became one of the Frankfurt School's founders.
3312720	3316080	This ideological strain of Marxism would be called Western Marxism, to differentiate
3316080	3318200	it from the Soviet-style Eastern Marxism.
3318200	3321560	Both the members of the Frankfurt School, as well as other French intellectuals not
3321560	3325220	strictly affiliated with it, were heavily influenced by this idea, and more formally
3325220	3329680	developed Gramsci's ideas into a theory of subversion by a long march through liberal
3329680	3330680	institutions.
3330680	3333280	Academic, cultural, journalistic, legal, all of it.
3333280	3337220	During the American period of the Frankfurt School, American contributions created critical
3337220	3341480	legal theory, which originally began as a method of analyzing law, but was rapidly adopted
3341480	3344040	to cultural analysis, critique, and activism.
3344040	3348600	The discipline fractured across intersectional lines in the wake of neoconservatism's popularity,
3348600	3352720	with the most well-known strain today being critical race theory, due to a push to have
3352720	3356680	it taught in American schools, and a reaction to that attempt by the American right-wing.
3356680	3360520	But all throughout these transformations and differing theorists, it remains Gramsciian
3360520	3361800	at its core.
3361800	3366200	Use critical analysis to expose hegemony's weaknesses, build countercultures to propagandize
3366200	3370140	the masses, and soften liberal society in preparation for a revolution.
3370140	3373900	Gramsci probably didn't consider that his theory would be used in the service of American
3373900	3378560	racial minorities or sexual minorities, but he laid the groundwork that later people would
3378560	3382180	adopt to establish their own subversive movements.
3382180	3386000	Understanding all of this will help you properly contextualize a lot of the stuff we see nowadays
3386000	3387680	on all levels of society.
3387680	3391780	Look at something large, like diversity hires and quotas, and affirmative action in society's
3391780	3395840	largest institutions, from schools giving blatant racial privileges to minorities, or
3395840	3398780	rainbow capitalism in the biggest companies in the world.
3398780	3404280	Look at something medium-sized, like shitty, forced diversity, inclusion, and equity initiatives
3404280	3408400	in pop culture and entertainment media, where the quality of the art takes a backseat to
3408400	3412980	ensuring that minorities always take center stage, and leftist agitators demand that more
3412980	3416060	cultural properties be ceded to their politics.
3416060	3420820	Hell, look at something small, like the unending, cancerous fucking discussions about appropriately
3420820	3422420	platforming problematic people.
3422420	3426120	On a personal level, I know my friend Stardust recently went through that, where she decided
3426120	3430160	to talk to Richard Spencer on her stream, and some retard raked her over the coals for
3430160	3434720	not using her 10,000 sub YouTube channel responsibly by his estimation.
3434720	3439200	All of these disparate things flow from this source and serve this purpose.
3439200	3444600	The desire to move the world more leftward, inch by inch, space by space, thought by thought,
3444600	3446280	that is the primary objective.
3446280	3450120	The second objective is, for those people in spaces that won't move leftward, or even
3450120	3454640	just don't care, either demoralizing them until they capitulate, or isolating them until
3454640	3457960	they radicalize, lose all their support, and become irrelevant.
3457960	3462120	This is the reason why every single event has to push a leftist agenda or be considered
3462120	3463120	fascist.
3463120	3466140	This is the reason why liberals or centrists cannot remain unaligned.
3466140	3471320	They have to be forced into one of two extremist camps, either to be propagandized as a fellow
3471320	3473960	subversive, or to be identified as an enemy and destroyed.
3473960	3479000	Now, none of this means that if, for example, a black person complains about being treated
3479000	3482880	in a racist way, that that's critical race theory, and it's part of the socialist subversion,
3482880	3487200	and we need to stamp it out and enforce a strictly racist, pro-white culture or something.
3487200	3491620	That also doesn't mean that two gay men getting married is inherently advancing the dialectic
3491620	3493000	towards revolution, either.
3493000	3498900	The bulwark against this is ultimately liberal, colorblind, value-neutral policies, the very
3498900	3503880	thing that Kimberle Crenshaw denounced as racist and sexist and right-wing in her writing.
3503880	3508920	This is why, when they say, you need to give my group special consideration, we need equity,
3508920	3512060	not equality, you simply need to tell them, no.
3512060	3514180	This is the roadmap that they want to travel down.
3514180	3518740	They will appeal to liberal morality and sensibilities to get you to go down that path, but that's
3518740	3519860	part of the subversion.
3519860	3523240	And just like that often-misattributed quote from the start of the video, they are looking
3523240	3525420	to hang you with your own rope.
3525420	3530460	To be a liberal means to stand by those colorblind, value-neutral policies even as they look to
3530460	3532440	use your compassion against you.
3532440	3536520	It means to be tolerant of cultural differences and subcultures, but only to a point.
3536520	3540700	You are under no moral obligation to foster a revolution against you.
3540700	3544540	Starting in Gramscian subversive tactics, but from the right-wing, as a lot of dissident
3544540	3548100	rightists are currently advocating for, we'll certainly swing the pendulum back around,
3548100	3552340	but we will be faced with the exact same problem, only this time coming from the other direction.
3552340	3555680	The solution is based in unapologetic liberalism.
3555680	3560420	Whatever true crises that Gramscians and critical theorists identify with their analysis, liberalism
3560420	3563420	can fix without their revolutionary prescriptions.
3563420	3565260	There we go, that's my video on Antonio Gramsci.
3565260	3568300	I've been talking about doing it for at least a year, but I didn't really start cracking
3568300	3571100	open the Prison Notebook seriously until summer of 2022.
3571100	3574940	Also, Sock Dunn Left is either a mid-wit, or more likely, he's a subversive himself
3574940	3577620	who is saying it's not happening when he desperately wants it to happen.
3577620	3581140	And speaking of him, I know I'm responding to a Twitter thread that is over a month old,
3581140	3584360	but you know how the old saying goes, a lie can travel halfway around the world while
3584360	3586100	the truth is still putting on its shoes.
3586100	3589980	Yes, I know, that quote is commonly misattributed to Mark Twain, but I think it's fitting
3589980	3594060	to end this video the way we began it, on a commonly repeated quote that was never actually
3594060	3596580	said, but its underlying message still remains factual.
3596740	3600540	It doesn't matter though, I don't expect Sock Dunn Left to actually watch this or anything.
3600540	3604420	He's already moved on to making newer, dumber takes on Twitter that would likely take me
3604420	3606720	another month to debunk properly as well.
3606720	3610860	To borrow a phrase, the socialist intellectual ecosystem is broken.
3610860	3613300	Leftist grifters don't have to care about the truth.
