0	3840	Hello my friends, this is another one of those thinking videos where
3840	8080	I just kind of mull over an idea with minimal sources because this is mostly
8080	11360	my own thoughts in the subject, my own musings
11360	14640	and what we're talking about. And today we're talking about the birth control
14640	17040	pill and my theory that birth control probably
17040	20960	caused third wave feminism and social justice and all of the
20960	24240	modern radical left BS we seem to be seeing today.
24240	28240	Now this is an idea that I might have spoken about on one of Sargon's streams
28240	31600	like a year ago and as soon as I brought it up he
31600	34240	laughed and thought it was kind of a funny idea but then he asked me to
34240	37920	unpack it to explain myself so I just didn't sound like some kind of
37920	42240	some kind of lunatic and I did and I think I did an okay job of doing it.
42240	44480	I don't remember the stream it's probably going to be hard to find
44480	47680	honestly at this point but I have been thinking about the theory on and off and
47680	52240	I think I have it a bit more refined. We figured out that from a biological
52240	54720	perspective the type of man that a woman finds
54720	58880	attractive does change somewhat depending on her fertility cycle.
58880	62960	So when a woman is more fertile she finds more masculine men attractive and
62960	66400	when a woman is less fertile she finds less masculine men
66400	68640	attractive. There was even a study done I hope I can
68640	72160	find it and splice it into the video where women judged their attractiveness
72160	75520	to various men based only on the width of the jaw so it
75520	79120	was like a picture where only you only saw how wide the man's jaw was
79120	83360	and the jaw width they preferred actually changed depending on what time
83360	85520	of the month it was. Now there's going to be a lot of red
85520	87680	pill types out there who talk about how this is
87680	91600	an obvious example of why all women are cheaters and it is in their biological
91600	94720	nature to be inherently unfaithful and how they're
94720	98240	always going to look for the alpha male to have sex with while
98240	101040	she's fertile and then try to find a beta male to
101040	104320	actually raise the kids. And maybe there's some biological truth
104320	106720	to that but I'm more inclined to believe that
106720	109760	shitty women who cheat will use that as a justification
109760	113360	and shitty men who cheat will use a very similar justification
113360	116400	you know the whole sowing your wild oats stuff.
116400	119840	Regardless of the biology we're still intelligent rational creatures
119840	122480	we're still in control of what we choose to do and we still have a
122480	124560	responsibility to those choices that we make
124560	128000	but from what I understand the birth control pill basically
128000	131760	freezes a woman's fertility cycle in that period where she's
131760	135360	not fertile so therefore she always finds the beta male attractive
135360	138400	and in fact there's been multiple cases where a woman who was consistently on
138480	141920	birth control for many years starts dating a guy and after she
141920	145600	decides to go off birth control so they can have children or whatever
145600	148960	she no longer finds him attractive she says he's not manly enough he's not
148960	152880	virile enough is it pronounced virile I don't know but this sort of thing
152880	155600	happens often I'm not saying it happens to all women I'm not even saying that it
155600	158240	happens reliably but it happens reliably enough that
158240	161680	statisticians and and sociologists and stuff have have taken notice.
161680	165440	So on the one hand you could take a purely biological deterministic approach
165440	168960	to this and believe that more beta males are
168960	172400	reproducing therefore the children that they're creating are also more beta than
172400	174240	they would have been maybe that's the case
174240	177920	but there's also the fact that the pill has given women control of when
177920	181600	and how many kids they have rather than having eight or ten throughout their
181600	185200	20s they're having one or two when they're
185200	188880	30 or 35 or 38 and yeah there's obvious problems with
188880	192720	that you know the the rates of deformity and various diseases and disorders you
192720	195120	know they all go up when you have a pregnancy in your 30s
195120	197440	instead of your 20s I think we all know that at this point
197440	201200	but even if the children are healthy you've also kind of put all your eggs in
201200	204480	one basket you know if you have eight kids throughout your 20s
204480	207760	you're not really raising them anymore they're they're raising each other
207760	211600	you don't have enough energy to to raise all them all the time
211600	214960	you do what you can then you rely on the older kids to help out the younger kids
214960	218080	I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to those older kids in fact it's probably
218080	220880	quite unfair but that is what necessity requires
220880	224240	but genetically you haven't put all your eggs in one basket
224240	227680	and the cold hard truth of it is some of those kids could die and the family
227680	230480	unit would still be intact I'm not saying it wouldn't it wouldn't
230480	234560	ruin you it obviously would no one wants to see their kids dead but
234560	238400	it's not the same as having one child and having that child die at
238400	242480	that point the family's gone the the future lineage no longer exists
242480	247280	but if you have eight kids and one of them dies that's a terrible tragedy
247280	251200	but the other seven will you know more or less grow up and
251200	255120	have their own kids and in a few generations things will be roughly back
255120	258240	to normal it sounds harsh and maybe it is harsh
258240	260800	the world's a harsh place I'm not saying that I don't have
260800	263600	feelings for these mothers who have lost children
263600	267200	but when you when you only have a few kids at the end of your
267200	271360	reliably fertile period you have really put all your eggs in one basket
271360	274240	there are some advantages to that you know you can devote more resources to
274240	276800	them maybe maybe with your eight kids some
276800	278800	kids are going hungry more than they should
278800	281760	something like that maybe you can afford to send them to a better school maybe
281760	284880	the family christmas is a bit more of a cheerier time because there's more gifts
284880	288880	to be to be passed around but at the same time you have every
288880	292480	incentive to helicopter parent if you only have one or two kids you
292480	297680	have every incentive to to really I don't know overbear on them and
297680	300400	really try to ensure that everything goes perfectly for them
300400	303440	and that's why you see the rise of things like parents who get really
303440	307280	gung-ho about their kids baseball or football careers you know
307280	310560	whatever career it is when they're nine years old playing with other kids or
310560	313440	like playing in a local league or something you know they get they get
313440	316960	really into it well because they can kind of afford to do that they
316960	319040	have the resources to do that and they have the
319040	322960	the mindset to do that it's why you see parents complaining to the teacher
322960	326080	rather than their kids when their kids start failing at school
326080	329360	because of this helicoptering overprotective
329360	333040	this is my one chance so I better make this kid count kind of mentality
333040	336880	and you know over the course of 20 years or 25 years or 30 years
336880	341360	this this movement has been like a wave through demographics it's gone through
341360	345120	preschool it's gone through primary school it's gone through high school
345120	349280	and now it's in the universities and the universities um to their discredit they
349280	352240	should have put their foot down they should have said no no your kids are 18
352240	354000	when they're coming here they're adults now
354000	357040	you no longer get to helicopter parent them you no longer get to baby them
357040	360640	you no longer get to email professors and harass them because your kid failed
360640	363120	their class you no longer get to have safe spaces
363120	367280	when you come on campus because hey this is a place of learning this is a
367280	370480	place of discussing at difficult topics but when enough people complain and
370480	373680	those people are paying money well that's the way things go so you end
373680	377520	up with a generation basically of simps there's no other way to put it they're
377520	380640	they're like a softened generation they're snowflakes that have have
380640	384000	tantrums and meltdowns and they're constantly triggered whenever something
384000	386320	that they don't personally like happens to
386320	389520	them or is said around them and now the workplace is having to adapt
389520	392400	to this stuff I bet HR departments are making a killing right now
392400	396880	but it really seems like this all kind of spawned from birth control in a sense
396880	400720	since it created a culture of parents who really only had
400720	404400	one shot to be a parent and they invested everything they had in making
404400	406240	that right and so now you have a generation of
406240	408800	people who have been who have been coddled
408800	413120	and catered to and who can't really grasp why things don't go their way
413120	416800	they view their own failings as society's personal attack on them
416800	421040	and oftentimes they'll turn to various totalitarian ideologies as adults
421040	424160	to try and fill in the gaps rather than simply taking responsibility for their
424160	426400	own failures and the generation I'm talking about
426400	430000	is my generation and I have to be honest um there was once a point where I was
430000	432640	like this too I had to really grow out of it in my
432640	434640	20s because it was holding me back in life
434640	438560	it would seem to me that women having control of their reproduction
438560	442160	was as big of a change at least demographically as the invention of the
442160	445200	computer was for technology or communication or as
445200	447840	the invention of the atom bomb was for war
447840	452160	birth control was that for human biology we have to ask some serious questions
452160	454720	that I'm sure feminists don't really want me to ask
454720	458640	what are women now to men from a strictly biological sense
458640	462000	I don't mean socially I mean we're still going to treat each other as if we are
462000	466880	the genders that we are but I mean biologically before men
466880	470160	had at least a basic understanding of what women were and that
470160	474400	basic understanding as terrible as it might sound to our modern sensibilities
474480	478320	was the person that you have sex with and create children with
478320	481920	but if they are not that anymore biologically
481920	486720	what what are they do we even know it's almost like humanity has become a
486720	490560	different species in a sense so many species are identified by their
490560	494240	reproductive patterns and we have radically changed ours using
494240	497520	our own technology we've changed what women are attracted to using our own
497520	499680	technology and in the human species women have
499680	503520	always been the sexual selector so what does that mean for us the helicopter
503520	507040	parenting culture was the impetus that caused every major
507040	510160	structure from school to the universities to the workplace to
510160	513760	value safety over personal freedom and if safety is the name of the game
513760	517680	well then you have all of these various oppressed minorities and groups all
517680	522080	jockeying for their own safe space all talking about how the heteronormative
522080	525760	capitalist patriarchy is oppressing them and needs to be done away with and
525760	529040	demanding other people's freedoms be curtailed in order to get the job done
529040	532960	in the name of safety and and you have to ask where has that left us
532960	536000	if the radical left's view of all hierarchies being corrupt
536000	539040	is just taken as a given fact at this point
539040	542000	what is the natural end result of that well that would mean that hierarchies
542000	544080	that are just don't exist and it's all just
544080	547120	power politics and that would mean that those people who have
547120	551760	traditional aspirations are also corrupt women like the tried wives we've talked
551760	555040	about before are simply gender traitors and men are
555040	558560	simply abusive patriarchs looking to take their place within that corrupt
558560	560640	hierarchy if you spend an entire generation
560640	563840	telling boys and girls this message and then you start to tailor both the
563840	567120	workplace and the school in this direction as well
567120	570160	you end up with a generation of dissatisfied women who can't seem to
570160	573600	find men that meet their standards and depressed men who don't know what
573600	577040	to do with their lives and judging by the former's complaints
577040	580800	and the latter's suicide rate it would seem like this is the case
580800	583760	but at the same time the whole idea doesn't really make any sense does it
583760	587040	because no feminist will ever complain when a woman takes on one of those
587040	591040	corrupt patriarchal roles you know you see a woman's ceo or you
591040	594160	see a woman superhero like captain marvel or something acting the way that
594160	596640	superman would it seems to be completely fine for a
596640	600480	woman to take on this corrupt role and become a patriarch herself
600480	603760	it's good for her to do it but but men can't do it it's an inherently
603760	606480	contradictory philosophy and i would say that it's because the
606480	609680	philosophy itself is not really meant to be understood
609680	613840	it's only meant to destroy things at the same time the left is correct on
613840	616720	some level about hierarchies in in ways that the
616720	620000	right wing generally can't accept conservatives like hierarchies and they
620000	624080	don't really seem to understand just how corrupt hierarchies can get if
624080	627360	you're not keeping a proper eye out sometimes the corruption the sjws
627360	631120	complain about actually does exist but their solution of destroying the
631120	635360	hierarchy itself doesn't help anyone it in fact makes the situation worse
635360	638720	people are on some level built to take their place
638720	642080	in a non-corrupt hierarchy because it ultimately isn't about being
642080	646480	in a hierarchy of stacked up people like a corporate hierarchy or something
646480	650640	it's more about the hierarchy of the individual what you value for your life
650640	654080	what you aim at what you aspire to be and if you take away that hierarchy you
654080	656720	can no longer rank order what you prefer and what you
656720	659440	don't prefer when you destroy the hierarchy you destroy
659440	663520	aspiration itself and without that there's no possibility of self-improvement
663520	667120	if there's no way to judge what possible future you is the better one
667120	670640	how could you possibly move into the future these same people radical
670640	674160	feminists social justice warriors they often overlap with the marxists who
674160	678800	talk about the dreaded one percent let's be honest here the one percent is
678800	681840	somebody who makes more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year i think
681840	684960	that's the number because most people in the world live in abject poverty and if
684960	687600	you make more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year
687600	691600	um you are making more money than 99 of people in the world
691600	695600	that seems to be the proper cutoff line for the dreaded one percent
695600	698320	so why is it that all of these people these people who can afford to go to
698320	701840	these universities these these sociology professors these these
701840	703760	gender studies professors and whatever else
703760	706960	all people who are making way more money than that usually unless you're going to
706960	709760	school on a loan and if you're going to school on a loan
709760	712000	for gender studies maybe you should rethink your life
712000	715280	but all of these people are already in the one percent all of these bougie
715280	718560	socialists and communists they actually just hate people who are
718560	721840	rich they don't care about poor people at all they just want to take out their
721840	724720	jealousy on those who have been more successful than they are
724720	727760	there's a joke that actually floats around academic circles at least it did
727760	730640	back when i was in school maybe maybe the HR department has snuffed it out
730640	734400	if you quadruple the pay of a university teacher all of this multicultural
734400	736960	indoctrination will disappear because what you have
736960	739280	right now are a bunch of people in academia
739280	743520	who are just hyper intelligent but really have nothing going for them
743520	747680	with the exception of their intelligence and so they are just pissed that people
747680	751040	who are working out in like the more capitalist spaces of society
751040	754320	make more money than them you might say that i've gone off topic from the whole
754320	757520	birth control thing maybe i have a little bit but i definitely think they're
757520	759520	connected i think what's happened is that we
759520	762960	haven't properly adapted to the invention of the birth control we
762960	767360	haven't changed our our viewpoints and even in some
767360	770560	senses our culture to properly deal with what birth control
770560	774800	means basically we've been using old rules for a fundamentally new game
774800	777840	and the end result of that has filtered down through everything
777840	781120	into academia into the media into the workplace
781120	785120	and this drive towards equality and safety
785120	788400	and away from personal freedom and liberty has come about
788400	792240	basically because we have become so successful
792240	795680	that we can afford to be soft in that manner at least in the short term
795680	799040	i think if this stuff doesn't stop it will destroy our society eventually
799040	802320	but in the short term we can afford to be
802320	805200	a little bit of a softened generation because we're no longer dealing with the
805200	807440	same problems that we were dealing with 100 years ago
807440	810720	coronavirus seems to be a pretty big deal but i highly doubt it's going to
810720	813840	turn into like the next black death it's very unlikely we're going to
813840	817120	actually see a world war 3 despite whatever has been going on with the
817120	820160	climate the possibility of a serious famine
820160	823360	seems to be rather low right now it almost seems
823360	826560	like our own ingenuity has solved so many problems
826560	829920	that now the stuff that we're collectively complaining about is
829920	833360	not being comfortable enough or being too offended on the internet
833360	837120	or somebody coming to university and saying something that you don't like
837120	842240	human beings are in a sense pack animals we need a load to lift if we're going to
842240	846240	feel any kind of meaning in our lives and since a lot of the larger problems
846240	849520	have been solved maybe maybe all we have left to do is
849520	853120	complain about small problems problems that frankly shouldn't even be
853120	856240	complained about due to the whole freedom and liberty thing
856240	858880	and i really do think that that part of that
858880	863600	cultural shift came about because of the impact of the birth control pill
863600	867280	what it did to reproduction and then what our reproduction did to the society
867280	869760	in which we live
