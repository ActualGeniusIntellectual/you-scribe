00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Hello my friends, this is another one of those thinking videos where

00:03.840 --> 00:08.080
I just kind of mull over an idea with minimal sources because this is mostly

00:08.080 --> 00:11.360
my own thoughts in the subject, my own musings

00:11.360 --> 00:14.640
and what we're talking about. And today we're talking about the birth control

00:14.640 --> 00:17.040
pill and my theory that birth control probably

00:17.040 --> 00:20.960
caused third wave feminism and social justice and all of the

00:20.960 --> 00:24.240
modern radical left BS we seem to be seeing today.

00:24.240 --> 00:28.240
Now this is an idea that I might have spoken about on one of Sargon's streams

00:28.240 --> 00:31.600
like a year ago and as soon as I brought it up he

00:31.600 --> 00:34.240
laughed and thought it was kind of a funny idea but then he asked me to

00:34.240 --> 00:37.920
unpack it to explain myself so I just didn't sound like some kind of

00:37.920 --> 00:42.240
some kind of lunatic and I did and I think I did an okay job of doing it.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.480
I don't remember the stream it's probably going to be hard to find

00:44.480 --> 00:47.680
honestly at this point but I have been thinking about the theory on and off and

00:47.680 --> 00:52.240
I think I have it a bit more refined. We figured out that from a biological

00:52.240 --> 00:54.720
perspective the type of man that a woman finds

00:54.720 --> 00:58.880
attractive does change somewhat depending on her fertility cycle.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.960
So when a woman is more fertile she finds more masculine men attractive and

01:02.960 --> 01:06.400
when a woman is less fertile she finds less masculine men

01:06.400 --> 01:08.640
attractive. There was even a study done I hope I can

01:08.640 --> 01:12.160
find it and splice it into the video where women judged their attractiveness

01:12.160 --> 01:15.520
to various men based only on the width of the jaw so it

01:15.520 --> 01:19.120
was like a picture where only you only saw how wide the man's jaw was

01:19.120 --> 01:23.360
and the jaw width they preferred actually changed depending on what time

01:23.360 --> 01:25.520
of the month it was. Now there's going to be a lot of red

01:25.520 --> 01:27.680
pill types out there who talk about how this is

01:27.680 --> 01:31.600
an obvious example of why all women are cheaters and it is in their biological

01:31.600 --> 01:34.720
nature to be inherently unfaithful and how they're

01:34.720 --> 01:38.240
always going to look for the alpha male to have sex with while

01:38.240 --> 01:41.040
she's fertile and then try to find a beta male to

01:41.040 --> 01:44.320
actually raise the kids. And maybe there's some biological truth

01:44.320 --> 01:46.720
to that but I'm more inclined to believe that

01:46.720 --> 01:49.760
shitty women who cheat will use that as a justification

01:49.760 --> 01:53.360
and shitty men who cheat will use a very similar justification

01:53.360 --> 01:56.400
you know the whole sowing your wild oats stuff.

01:56.400 --> 01:59.840
Regardless of the biology we're still intelligent rational creatures

01:59.840 --> 02:02.480
we're still in control of what we choose to do and we still have a

02:02.480 --> 02:04.560
responsibility to those choices that we make

02:04.560 --> 02:08.000
but from what I understand the birth control pill basically

02:08.000 --> 02:11.760
freezes a woman's fertility cycle in that period where she's

02:11.760 --> 02:15.360
not fertile so therefore she always finds the beta male attractive

02:15.360 --> 02:18.400
and in fact there's been multiple cases where a woman who was consistently on

02:18.480 --> 02:21.920
birth control for many years starts dating a guy and after she

02:21.920 --> 02:25.600
decides to go off birth control so they can have children or whatever

02:25.600 --> 02:28.960
she no longer finds him attractive she says he's not manly enough he's not

02:28.960 --> 02:32.880
virile enough is it pronounced virile I don't know but this sort of thing

02:32.880 --> 02:35.600
happens often I'm not saying it happens to all women I'm not even saying that it

02:35.600 --> 02:38.240
happens reliably but it happens reliably enough that

02:38.240 --> 02:41.680
statisticians and and sociologists and stuff have have taken notice.

02:41.680 --> 02:45.440
So on the one hand you could take a purely biological deterministic approach

02:45.440 --> 02:48.960
to this and believe that more beta males are

02:48.960 --> 02:52.400
reproducing therefore the children that they're creating are also more beta than

02:52.400 --> 02:54.240
they would have been maybe that's the case

02:54.240 --> 02:57.920
but there's also the fact that the pill has given women control of when

02:57.920 --> 03:01.600
and how many kids they have rather than having eight or ten throughout their

03:01.600 --> 03:05.200
20s they're having one or two when they're

03:05.200 --> 03:08.880
30 or 35 or 38 and yeah there's obvious problems with

03:08.880 --> 03:12.720
that you know the the rates of deformity and various diseases and disorders you

03:12.720 --> 03:15.120
know they all go up when you have a pregnancy in your 30s

03:15.120 --> 03:17.440
instead of your 20s I think we all know that at this point

03:17.440 --> 03:21.200
but even if the children are healthy you've also kind of put all your eggs in

03:21.200 --> 03:24.480
one basket you know if you have eight kids throughout your 20s

03:24.480 --> 03:27.760
you're not really raising them anymore they're they're raising each other

03:27.760 --> 03:31.600
you don't have enough energy to to raise all them all the time

03:31.600 --> 03:34.960
you do what you can then you rely on the older kids to help out the younger kids

03:34.960 --> 03:38.080
I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to those older kids in fact it's probably

03:38.080 --> 03:40.880
quite unfair but that is what necessity requires

03:40.880 --> 03:44.240
but genetically you haven't put all your eggs in one basket

03:44.240 --> 03:47.680
and the cold hard truth of it is some of those kids could die and the family

03:47.680 --> 03:50.480
unit would still be intact I'm not saying it wouldn't it wouldn't

03:50.480 --> 03:54.560
ruin you it obviously would no one wants to see their kids dead but

03:54.560 --> 03:58.400
it's not the same as having one child and having that child die at

03:58.400 --> 04:02.480
that point the family's gone the the future lineage no longer exists

04:02.480 --> 04:07.280
but if you have eight kids and one of them dies that's a terrible tragedy

04:07.280 --> 04:11.200
but the other seven will you know more or less grow up and

04:11.200 --> 04:15.120
have their own kids and in a few generations things will be roughly back

04:15.120 --> 04:18.240
to normal it sounds harsh and maybe it is harsh

04:18.240 --> 04:20.800
the world's a harsh place I'm not saying that I don't have

04:20.800 --> 04:23.600
feelings for these mothers who have lost children

04:23.600 --> 04:27.200
but when you when you only have a few kids at the end of your

04:27.200 --> 04:31.360
reliably fertile period you have really put all your eggs in one basket

04:31.360 --> 04:34.240
there are some advantages to that you know you can devote more resources to

04:34.240 --> 04:36.800
them maybe maybe with your eight kids some

04:36.800 --> 04:38.800
kids are going hungry more than they should

04:38.800 --> 04:41.760
something like that maybe you can afford to send them to a better school maybe

04:41.760 --> 04:44.880
the family christmas is a bit more of a cheerier time because there's more gifts

04:44.880 --> 04:48.880
to be to be passed around but at the same time you have every

04:48.880 --> 04:52.480
incentive to helicopter parent if you only have one or two kids you

04:52.480 --> 04:57.680
have every incentive to to really I don't know overbear on them and

04:57.680 --> 05:00.400
really try to ensure that everything goes perfectly for them

05:00.400 --> 05:03.440
and that's why you see the rise of things like parents who get really

05:03.440 --> 05:07.280
gung-ho about their kids baseball or football careers you know

05:07.280 --> 05:10.560
whatever career it is when they're nine years old playing with other kids or

05:10.560 --> 05:13.440
like playing in a local league or something you know they get they get

05:13.440 --> 05:16.960
really into it well because they can kind of afford to do that they

05:16.960 --> 05:19.040
have the resources to do that and they have the

05:19.040 --> 05:22.960
the mindset to do that it's why you see parents complaining to the teacher

05:22.960 --> 05:26.080
rather than their kids when their kids start failing at school

05:26.080 --> 05:29.360
because of this helicoptering overprotective

05:29.360 --> 05:33.040
this is my one chance so I better make this kid count kind of mentality

05:33.040 --> 05:36.880
and you know over the course of 20 years or 25 years or 30 years

05:36.880 --> 05:41.360
this this movement has been like a wave through demographics it's gone through

05:41.360 --> 05:45.120
preschool it's gone through primary school it's gone through high school

05:45.120 --> 05:49.280
and now it's in the universities and the universities um to their discredit they

05:49.280 --> 05:52.240
should have put their foot down they should have said no no your kids are 18

05:52.240 --> 05:54.000
when they're coming here they're adults now

05:54.000 --> 05:57.040
you no longer get to helicopter parent them you no longer get to baby them

05:57.040 --> 06:00.640
you no longer get to email professors and harass them because your kid failed

06:00.640 --> 06:03.120
their class you no longer get to have safe spaces

06:03.120 --> 06:07.280
when you come on campus because hey this is a place of learning this is a

06:07.280 --> 06:10.480
place of discussing at difficult topics but when enough people complain and

06:10.480 --> 06:13.680
those people are paying money well that's the way things go so you end

06:13.680 --> 06:17.520
up with a generation basically of simps there's no other way to put it they're

06:17.520 --> 06:20.640
they're like a softened generation they're snowflakes that have have

06:20.640 --> 06:24.000
tantrums and meltdowns and they're constantly triggered whenever something

06:24.000 --> 06:26.320
that they don't personally like happens to

06:26.320 --> 06:29.520
them or is said around them and now the workplace is having to adapt

06:29.520 --> 06:32.400
to this stuff I bet HR departments are making a killing right now

06:32.400 --> 06:36.880
but it really seems like this all kind of spawned from birth control in a sense

06:36.880 --> 06:40.720
since it created a culture of parents who really only had

06:40.720 --> 06:44.400
one shot to be a parent and they invested everything they had in making

06:44.400 --> 06:46.240
that right and so now you have a generation of

06:46.240 --> 06:48.800
people who have been who have been coddled

06:48.800 --> 06:53.120
and catered to and who can't really grasp why things don't go their way

06:53.120 --> 06:56.800
they view their own failings as society's personal attack on them

06:56.800 --> 07:01.040
and oftentimes they'll turn to various totalitarian ideologies as adults

07:01.040 --> 07:04.160
to try and fill in the gaps rather than simply taking responsibility for their

07:04.160 --> 07:06.400
own failures and the generation I'm talking about

07:06.400 --> 07:10.000
is my generation and I have to be honest um there was once a point where I was

07:10.000 --> 07:12.640
like this too I had to really grow out of it in my

07:12.640 --> 07:14.640
20s because it was holding me back in life

07:14.640 --> 07:18.560
it would seem to me that women having control of their reproduction

07:18.560 --> 07:22.160
was as big of a change at least demographically as the invention of the

07:22.160 --> 07:25.200
computer was for technology or communication or as

07:25.200 --> 07:27.840
the invention of the atom bomb was for war

07:27.840 --> 07:32.160
birth control was that for human biology we have to ask some serious questions

07:32.160 --> 07:34.720
that I'm sure feminists don't really want me to ask

07:34.720 --> 07:38.640
what are women now to men from a strictly biological sense

07:38.640 --> 07:42.000
I don't mean socially I mean we're still going to treat each other as if we are

07:42.000 --> 07:46.880
the genders that we are but I mean biologically before men

07:46.880 --> 07:50.160
had at least a basic understanding of what women were and that

07:50.160 --> 07:54.400
basic understanding as terrible as it might sound to our modern sensibilities

07:54.480 --> 07:58.320
was the person that you have sex with and create children with

07:58.320 --> 08:01.920
but if they are not that anymore biologically

08:01.920 --> 08:06.720
what what are they do we even know it's almost like humanity has become a

08:06.720 --> 08:10.560
different species in a sense so many species are identified by their

08:10.560 --> 08:14.240
reproductive patterns and we have radically changed ours using

08:14.240 --> 08:17.520
our own technology we've changed what women are attracted to using our own

08:17.520 --> 08:19.680
technology and in the human species women have

08:19.680 --> 08:23.520
always been the sexual selector so what does that mean for us the helicopter

08:23.520 --> 08:27.040
parenting culture was the impetus that caused every major

08:27.040 --> 08:30.160
structure from school to the universities to the workplace to

08:30.160 --> 08:33.760
value safety over personal freedom and if safety is the name of the game

08:33.760 --> 08:37.680
well then you have all of these various oppressed minorities and groups all

08:37.680 --> 08:42.080
jockeying for their own safe space all talking about how the heteronormative

08:42.080 --> 08:45.760
capitalist patriarchy is oppressing them and needs to be done away with and

08:45.760 --> 08:49.040
demanding other people's freedoms be curtailed in order to get the job done

08:49.040 --> 08:52.960
in the name of safety and and you have to ask where has that left us

08:52.960 --> 08:56.000
if the radical left's view of all hierarchies being corrupt

08:56.000 --> 08:59.040
is just taken as a given fact at this point

08:59.040 --> 09:02.000
what is the natural end result of that well that would mean that hierarchies

09:02.000 --> 09:04.080
that are just don't exist and it's all just

09:04.080 --> 09:07.120
power politics and that would mean that those people who have

09:07.120 --> 09:11.760
traditional aspirations are also corrupt women like the tried wives we've talked

09:11.760 --> 09:15.040
about before are simply gender traitors and men are

09:15.040 --> 09:18.560
simply abusive patriarchs looking to take their place within that corrupt

09:18.560 --> 09:20.640
hierarchy if you spend an entire generation

09:20.640 --> 09:23.840
telling boys and girls this message and then you start to tailor both the

09:23.840 --> 09:27.120
workplace and the school in this direction as well

09:27.120 --> 09:30.160
you end up with a generation of dissatisfied women who can't seem to

09:30.160 --> 09:33.600
find men that meet their standards and depressed men who don't know what

09:33.600 --> 09:37.040
to do with their lives and judging by the former's complaints

09:37.040 --> 09:40.800
and the latter's suicide rate it would seem like this is the case

09:40.800 --> 09:43.760
but at the same time the whole idea doesn't really make any sense does it

09:43.760 --> 09:47.040
because no feminist will ever complain when a woman takes on one of those

09:47.040 --> 09:51.040
corrupt patriarchal roles you know you see a woman's ceo or you

09:51.040 --> 09:54.160
see a woman superhero like captain marvel or something acting the way that

09:54.160 --> 09:56.640
superman would it seems to be completely fine for a

09:56.640 --> 10:00.480
woman to take on this corrupt role and become a patriarch herself

10:00.480 --> 10:03.760
it's good for her to do it but but men can't do it it's an inherently

10:03.760 --> 10:06.480
contradictory philosophy and i would say that it's because the

10:06.480 --> 10:09.680
philosophy itself is not really meant to be understood

10:09.680 --> 10:13.840
it's only meant to destroy things at the same time the left is correct on

10:13.840 --> 10:16.720
some level about hierarchies in in ways that the

10:16.720 --> 10:20.000
right wing generally can't accept conservatives like hierarchies and they

10:20.000 --> 10:24.080
don't really seem to understand just how corrupt hierarchies can get if

10:24.080 --> 10:27.360
you're not keeping a proper eye out sometimes the corruption the sjws

10:27.360 --> 10:31.120
complain about actually does exist but their solution of destroying the

10:31.120 --> 10:35.360
hierarchy itself doesn't help anyone it in fact makes the situation worse

10:35.360 --> 10:38.720
people are on some level built to take their place

10:38.720 --> 10:42.080
in a non-corrupt hierarchy because it ultimately isn't about being

10:42.080 --> 10:46.480
in a hierarchy of stacked up people like a corporate hierarchy or something

10:46.480 --> 10:50.640
it's more about the hierarchy of the individual what you value for your life

10:50.640 --> 10:54.080
what you aim at what you aspire to be and if you take away that hierarchy you

10:54.080 --> 10:56.720
can no longer rank order what you prefer and what you

10:56.720 --> 10:59.440
don't prefer when you destroy the hierarchy you destroy

10:59.440 --> 11:03.520
aspiration itself and without that there's no possibility of self-improvement

11:03.520 --> 11:07.120
if there's no way to judge what possible future you is the better one

11:07.120 --> 11:10.640
how could you possibly move into the future these same people radical

11:10.640 --> 11:14.160
feminists social justice warriors they often overlap with the marxists who

11:14.160 --> 11:18.800
talk about the dreaded one percent let's be honest here the one percent is

11:18.800 --> 11:21.840
somebody who makes more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year i think

11:21.840 --> 11:24.960
that's the number because most people in the world live in abject poverty and if

11:24.960 --> 11:27.600
you make more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year

11:27.600 --> 11:31.600
um you are making more money than 99 of people in the world

11:31.600 --> 11:35.600
that seems to be the proper cutoff line for the dreaded one percent

11:35.600 --> 11:38.320
so why is it that all of these people these people who can afford to go to

11:38.320 --> 11:41.840
these universities these these sociology professors these these

11:41.840 --> 11:43.760
gender studies professors and whatever else

11:43.760 --> 11:46.960
all people who are making way more money than that usually unless you're going to

11:46.960 --> 11:49.760
school on a loan and if you're going to school on a loan

11:49.760 --> 11:52.000
for gender studies maybe you should rethink your life

11:52.000 --> 11:55.280
but all of these people are already in the one percent all of these bougie

11:55.280 --> 11:58.560
socialists and communists they actually just hate people who are

11:58.560 --> 12:01.840
rich they don't care about poor people at all they just want to take out their

12:01.840 --> 12:04.720
jealousy on those who have been more successful than they are

12:04.720 --> 12:07.760
there's a joke that actually floats around academic circles at least it did

12:07.760 --> 12:10.640
back when i was in school maybe maybe the HR department has snuffed it out

12:10.640 --> 12:14.400
if you quadruple the pay of a university teacher all of this multicultural

12:14.400 --> 12:16.960
indoctrination will disappear because what you have

12:16.960 --> 12:19.280
right now are a bunch of people in academia

12:19.280 --> 12:23.520
who are just hyper intelligent but really have nothing going for them

12:23.520 --> 12:27.680
with the exception of their intelligence and so they are just pissed that people

12:27.680 --> 12:31.040
who are working out in like the more capitalist spaces of society

12:31.040 --> 12:34.320
make more money than them you might say that i've gone off topic from the whole

12:34.320 --> 12:37.520
birth control thing maybe i have a little bit but i definitely think they're

12:37.520 --> 12:39.520
connected i think what's happened is that we

12:39.520 --> 12:42.960
haven't properly adapted to the invention of the birth control we

12:42.960 --> 12:47.360
haven't changed our our viewpoints and even in some

12:47.360 --> 12:50.560
senses our culture to properly deal with what birth control

12:50.560 --> 12:54.800
means basically we've been using old rules for a fundamentally new game

12:54.800 --> 12:57.840
and the end result of that has filtered down through everything

12:57.840 --> 13:01.120
into academia into the media into the workplace

13:01.120 --> 13:05.120
and this drive towards equality and safety

13:05.120 --> 13:08.400
and away from personal freedom and liberty has come about

13:08.400 --> 13:12.240
basically because we have become so successful

13:12.240 --> 13:15.680
that we can afford to be soft in that manner at least in the short term

13:15.680 --> 13:19.040
i think if this stuff doesn't stop it will destroy our society eventually

13:19.040 --> 13:22.320
but in the short term we can afford to be

13:22.320 --> 13:25.200
a little bit of a softened generation because we're no longer dealing with the

13:25.200 --> 13:27.440
same problems that we were dealing with 100 years ago

13:27.440 --> 13:30.720
coronavirus seems to be a pretty big deal but i highly doubt it's going to

13:30.720 --> 13:33.840
turn into like the next black death it's very unlikely we're going to

13:33.840 --> 13:37.120
actually see a world war 3 despite whatever has been going on with the

13:37.120 --> 13:40.160
climate the possibility of a serious famine

13:40.160 --> 13:43.360
seems to be rather low right now it almost seems

13:43.360 --> 13:46.560
like our own ingenuity has solved so many problems

13:46.560 --> 13:49.920
that now the stuff that we're collectively complaining about is

13:49.920 --> 13:53.360
not being comfortable enough or being too offended on the internet

13:53.360 --> 13:57.120
or somebody coming to university and saying something that you don't like

13:57.120 --> 14:02.240
human beings are in a sense pack animals we need a load to lift if we're going to

14:02.240 --> 14:06.240
feel any kind of meaning in our lives and since a lot of the larger problems

14:06.240 --> 14:09.520
have been solved maybe maybe all we have left to do is

14:09.520 --> 14:13.120
complain about small problems problems that frankly shouldn't even be

14:13.120 --> 14:16.240
complained about due to the whole freedom and liberty thing

14:16.240 --> 14:18.880
and i really do think that that part of that

14:18.880 --> 14:23.600
cultural shift came about because of the impact of the birth control pill

14:23.600 --> 14:27.280
what it did to reproduction and then what our reproduction did to the society

14:27.280 --> 14:29.760
in which we live
