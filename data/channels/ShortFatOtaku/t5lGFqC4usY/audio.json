{"text": " Hello my friends, this is another one of those thinking videos where I just kind of mull over an idea with minimal sources because this is mostly my own thoughts in the subject, my own musings and what we're talking about. And today we're talking about the birth control pill and my theory that birth control probably caused third wave feminism and social justice and all of the modern radical left BS we seem to be seeing today. Now this is an idea that I might have spoken about on one of Sargon's streams like a year ago and as soon as I brought it up he laughed and thought it was kind of a funny idea but then he asked me to unpack it to explain myself so I just didn't sound like some kind of some kind of lunatic and I did and I think I did an okay job of doing it. I don't remember the stream it's probably going to be hard to find honestly at this point but I have been thinking about the theory on and off and I think I have it a bit more refined. We figured out that from a biological perspective the type of man that a woman finds attractive does change somewhat depending on her fertility cycle. So when a woman is more fertile she finds more masculine men attractive and when a woman is less fertile she finds less masculine men attractive. There was even a study done I hope I can find it and splice it into the video where women judged their attractiveness to various men based only on the width of the jaw so it was like a picture where only you only saw how wide the man's jaw was and the jaw width they preferred actually changed depending on what time of the month it was. Now there's going to be a lot of red pill types out there who talk about how this is an obvious example of why all women are cheaters and it is in their biological nature to be inherently unfaithful and how they're always going to look for the alpha male to have sex with while she's fertile and then try to find a beta male to actually raise the kids. And maybe there's some biological truth to that but I'm more inclined to believe that shitty women who cheat will use that as a justification and shitty men who cheat will use a very similar justification you know the whole sowing your wild oats stuff. Regardless of the biology we're still intelligent rational creatures we're still in control of what we choose to do and we still have a responsibility to those choices that we make but from what I understand the birth control pill basically freezes a woman's fertility cycle in that period where she's not fertile so therefore she always finds the beta male attractive and in fact there's been multiple cases where a woman who was consistently on birth control for many years starts dating a guy and after she decides to go off birth control so they can have children or whatever she no longer finds him attractive she says he's not manly enough he's not virile enough is it pronounced virile I don't know but this sort of thing happens often I'm not saying it happens to all women I'm not even saying that it happens reliably but it happens reliably enough that statisticians and and sociologists and stuff have have taken notice. So on the one hand you could take a purely biological deterministic approach to this and believe that more beta males are reproducing therefore the children that they're creating are also more beta than they would have been maybe that's the case but there's also the fact that the pill has given women control of when and how many kids they have rather than having eight or ten throughout their 20s they're having one or two when they're 30 or 35 or 38 and yeah there's obvious problems with that you know the the rates of deformity and various diseases and disorders you know they all go up when you have a pregnancy in your 30s instead of your 20s I think we all know that at this point but even if the children are healthy you've also kind of put all your eggs in one basket you know if you have eight kids throughout your 20s you're not really raising them anymore they're they're raising each other you don't have enough energy to to raise all them all the time you do what you can then you rely on the older kids to help out the younger kids I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to those older kids in fact it's probably quite unfair but that is what necessity requires but genetically you haven't put all your eggs in one basket and the cold hard truth of it is some of those kids could die and the family unit would still be intact I'm not saying it wouldn't it wouldn't ruin you it obviously would no one wants to see their kids dead but it's not the same as having one child and having that child die at that point the family's gone the the future lineage no longer exists but if you have eight kids and one of them dies that's a terrible tragedy but the other seven will you know more or less grow up and have their own kids and in a few generations things will be roughly back to normal it sounds harsh and maybe it is harsh the world's a harsh place I'm not saying that I don't have feelings for these mothers who have lost children but when you when you only have a few kids at the end of your reliably fertile period you have really put all your eggs in one basket there are some advantages to that you know you can devote more resources to them maybe maybe with your eight kids some kids are going hungry more than they should something like that maybe you can afford to send them to a better school maybe the family christmas is a bit more of a cheerier time because there's more gifts to be to be passed around but at the same time you have every incentive to helicopter parent if you only have one or two kids you have every incentive to to really I don't know overbear on them and really try to ensure that everything goes perfectly for them and that's why you see the rise of things like parents who get really gung-ho about their kids baseball or football careers you know whatever career it is when they're nine years old playing with other kids or like playing in a local league or something you know they get they get really into it well because they can kind of afford to do that they have the resources to do that and they have the the mindset to do that it's why you see parents complaining to the teacher rather than their kids when their kids start failing at school because of this helicoptering overprotective this is my one chance so I better make this kid count kind of mentality and you know over the course of 20 years or 25 years or 30 years this this movement has been like a wave through demographics it's gone through preschool it's gone through primary school it's gone through high school and now it's in the universities and the universities um to their discredit they should have put their foot down they should have said no no your kids are 18 when they're coming here they're adults now you no longer get to helicopter parent them you no longer get to baby them you no longer get to email professors and harass them because your kid failed their class you no longer get to have safe spaces when you come on campus because hey this is a place of learning this is a place of discussing at difficult topics but when enough people complain and those people are paying money well that's the way things go so you end up with a generation basically of simps there's no other way to put it they're they're like a softened generation they're snowflakes that have have tantrums and meltdowns and they're constantly triggered whenever something that they don't personally like happens to them or is said around them and now the workplace is having to adapt to this stuff I bet HR departments are making a killing right now but it really seems like this all kind of spawned from birth control in a sense since it created a culture of parents who really only had one shot to be a parent and they invested everything they had in making that right and so now you have a generation of people who have been who have been coddled and catered to and who can't really grasp why things don't go their way they view their own failings as society's personal attack on them and oftentimes they'll turn to various totalitarian ideologies as adults to try and fill in the gaps rather than simply taking responsibility for their own failures and the generation I'm talking about is my generation and I have to be honest um there was once a point where I was like this too I had to really grow out of it in my 20s because it was holding me back in life it would seem to me that women having control of their reproduction was as big of a change at least demographically as the invention of the computer was for technology or communication or as the invention of the atom bomb was for war birth control was that for human biology we have to ask some serious questions that I'm sure feminists don't really want me to ask what are women now to men from a strictly biological sense I don't mean socially I mean we're still going to treat each other as if we are the genders that we are but I mean biologically before men had at least a basic understanding of what women were and that basic understanding as terrible as it might sound to our modern sensibilities was the person that you have sex with and create children with but if they are not that anymore biologically what what are they do we even know it's almost like humanity has become a different species in a sense so many species are identified by their reproductive patterns and we have radically changed ours using our own technology we've changed what women are attracted to using our own technology and in the human species women have always been the sexual selector so what does that mean for us the helicopter parenting culture was the impetus that caused every major structure from school to the universities to the workplace to value safety over personal freedom and if safety is the name of the game well then you have all of these various oppressed minorities and groups all jockeying for their own safe space all talking about how the heteronormative capitalist patriarchy is oppressing them and needs to be done away with and demanding other people's freedoms be curtailed in order to get the job done in the name of safety and and you have to ask where has that left us if the radical left's view of all hierarchies being corrupt is just taken as a given fact at this point what is the natural end result of that well that would mean that hierarchies that are just don't exist and it's all just power politics and that would mean that those people who have traditional aspirations are also corrupt women like the tried wives we've talked about before are simply gender traitors and men are simply abusive patriarchs looking to take their place within that corrupt hierarchy if you spend an entire generation telling boys and girls this message and then you start to tailor both the workplace and the school in this direction as well you end up with a generation of dissatisfied women who can't seem to find men that meet their standards and depressed men who don't know what to do with their lives and judging by the former's complaints and the latter's suicide rate it would seem like this is the case but at the same time the whole idea doesn't really make any sense does it because no feminist will ever complain when a woman takes on one of those corrupt patriarchal roles you know you see a woman's ceo or you see a woman superhero like captain marvel or something acting the way that superman would it seems to be completely fine for a woman to take on this corrupt role and become a patriarch herself it's good for her to do it but but men can't do it it's an inherently contradictory philosophy and i would say that it's because the philosophy itself is not really meant to be understood it's only meant to destroy things at the same time the left is correct on some level about hierarchies in in ways that the right wing generally can't accept conservatives like hierarchies and they don't really seem to understand just how corrupt hierarchies can get if you're not keeping a proper eye out sometimes the corruption the sjws complain about actually does exist but their solution of destroying the hierarchy itself doesn't help anyone it in fact makes the situation worse people are on some level built to take their place in a non-corrupt hierarchy because it ultimately isn't about being in a hierarchy of stacked up people like a corporate hierarchy or something it's more about the hierarchy of the individual what you value for your life what you aim at what you aspire to be and if you take away that hierarchy you can no longer rank order what you prefer and what you don't prefer when you destroy the hierarchy you destroy aspiration itself and without that there's no possibility of self-improvement if there's no way to judge what possible future you is the better one how could you possibly move into the future these same people radical feminists social justice warriors they often overlap with the marxists who talk about the dreaded one percent let's be honest here the one percent is somebody who makes more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year i think that's the number because most people in the world live in abject poverty and if you make more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year um you are making more money than 99 of people in the world that seems to be the proper cutoff line for the dreaded one percent so why is it that all of these people these people who can afford to go to these universities these these sociology professors these these gender studies professors and whatever else all people who are making way more money than that usually unless you're going to school on a loan and if you're going to school on a loan for gender studies maybe you should rethink your life but all of these people are already in the one percent all of these bougie socialists and communists they actually just hate people who are rich they don't care about poor people at all they just want to take out their jealousy on those who have been more successful than they are there's a joke that actually floats around academic circles at least it did back when i was in school maybe maybe the HR department has snuffed it out if you quadruple the pay of a university teacher all of this multicultural indoctrination will disappear because what you have right now are a bunch of people in academia who are just hyper intelligent but really have nothing going for them with the exception of their intelligence and so they are just pissed that people who are working out in like the more capitalist spaces of society make more money than them you might say that i've gone off topic from the whole birth control thing maybe i have a little bit but i definitely think they're connected i think what's happened is that we haven't properly adapted to the invention of the birth control we haven't changed our our viewpoints and even in some senses our culture to properly deal with what birth control means basically we've been using old rules for a fundamentally new game and the end result of that has filtered down through everything into academia into the media into the workplace and this drive towards equality and safety and away from personal freedom and liberty has come about basically because we have become so successful that we can afford to be soft in that manner at least in the short term i think if this stuff doesn't stop it will destroy our society eventually but in the short term we can afford to be a little bit of a softened generation because we're no longer dealing with the same problems that we were dealing with 100 years ago coronavirus seems to be a pretty big deal but i highly doubt it's going to turn into like the next black death it's very unlikely we're going to actually see a world war 3 despite whatever has been going on with the climate the possibility of a serious famine seems to be rather low right now it almost seems like our own ingenuity has solved so many problems that now the stuff that we're collectively complaining about is not being comfortable enough or being too offended on the internet or somebody coming to university and saying something that you don't like human beings are in a sense pack animals we need a load to lift if we're going to feel any kind of meaning in our lives and since a lot of the larger problems have been solved maybe maybe all we have left to do is complain about small problems problems that frankly shouldn't even be complained about due to the whole freedom and liberty thing and i really do think that that part of that cultural shift came about because of the impact of the birth control pill what it did to reproduction and then what our reproduction did to the society in
