00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Hello my friends, this is another one of those thinking videos where

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,080
I just kind of mull over an idea with minimal sources because this is mostly

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,360
my own thoughts in the subject, my own musings

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,640
and what we're talking about. And today we're talking about the birth control

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,040
pill and my theory that birth control probably

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,960
caused third wave feminism and social justice and all of the

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
modern radical left BS we seem to be seeing today.

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,240
Now this is an idea that I might have spoken about on one of Sargon's streams

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,600
like a year ago and as soon as I brought it up he

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,240
laughed and thought it was kind of a funny idea but then he asked me to

11
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,920
unpack it to explain myself so I just didn't sound like some kind of

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,240
some kind of lunatic and I did and I think I did an okay job of doing it.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,480
I don't remember the stream it's probably going to be hard to find

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
honestly at this point but I have been thinking about the theory on and off and

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,240
I think I have it a bit more refined. We figured out that from a biological

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,720
perspective the type of man that a woman finds

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,880
attractive does change somewhat depending on her fertility cycle.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,960
So when a woman is more fertile she finds more masculine men attractive and

19
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
when a woman is less fertile she finds less masculine men

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,640
attractive. There was even a study done I hope I can

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,160
find it and splice it into the video where women judged their attractiveness

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,520
to various men based only on the width of the jaw so it

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,120
was like a picture where only you only saw how wide the man's jaw was

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,360
and the jaw width they preferred actually changed depending on what time

25
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,520
of the month it was. Now there's going to be a lot of red

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
pill types out there who talk about how this is

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,600
an obvious example of why all women are cheaters and it is in their biological

28
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,720
nature to be inherently unfaithful and how they're

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,240
always going to look for the alpha male to have sex with while

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
she's fertile and then try to find a beta male to

31
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
actually raise the kids. And maybe there's some biological truth

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,720
to that but I'm more inclined to believe that

33
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,760
shitty women who cheat will use that as a justification

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,360
and shitty men who cheat will use a very similar justification

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,400
you know the whole sowing your wild oats stuff.

36
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,840
Regardless of the biology we're still intelligent rational creatures

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,480
we're still in control of what we choose to do and we still have a

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,560
responsibility to those choices that we make

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,000
but from what I understand the birth control pill basically

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
freezes a woman's fertility cycle in that period where she's

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,360
not fertile so therefore she always finds the beta male attractive

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,400
and in fact there's been multiple cases where a woman who was consistently on

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,920
birth control for many years starts dating a guy and after she

44
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,600
decides to go off birth control so they can have children or whatever

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,960
she no longer finds him attractive she says he's not manly enough he's not

46
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,880
virile enough is it pronounced virile I don't know but this sort of thing

47
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,600
happens often I'm not saying it happens to all women I'm not even saying that it

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,240
happens reliably but it happens reliably enough that

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,680
statisticians and and sociologists and stuff have have taken notice.

50
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,440
So on the one hand you could take a purely biological deterministic approach

51
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,960
to this and believe that more beta males are

52
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,400
reproducing therefore the children that they're creating are also more beta than

53
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,240
they would have been maybe that's the case

54
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,920
but there's also the fact that the pill has given women control of when

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,600
and how many kids they have rather than having eight or ten throughout their

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,200
20s they're having one or two when they're

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,880
30 or 35 or 38 and yeah there's obvious problems with

58
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,720
that you know the the rates of deformity and various diseases and disorders you

59
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,120
know they all go up when you have a pregnancy in your 30s

60
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,440
instead of your 20s I think we all know that at this point

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,200
but even if the children are healthy you've also kind of put all your eggs in

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
one basket you know if you have eight kids throughout your 20s

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,760
you're not really raising them anymore they're they're raising each other

64
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,600
you don't have enough energy to to raise all them all the time

65
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,960
you do what you can then you rely on the older kids to help out the younger kids

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,080
I'm not saying it's necessarily fair to those older kids in fact it's probably

67
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,880
quite unfair but that is what necessity requires

68
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,240
but genetically you haven't put all your eggs in one basket

69
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,680
and the cold hard truth of it is some of those kids could die and the family

70
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,480
unit would still be intact I'm not saying it wouldn't it wouldn't

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,560
ruin you it obviously would no one wants to see their kids dead but

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,400
it's not the same as having one child and having that child die at

73
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,480
that point the family's gone the the future lineage no longer exists

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,280
but if you have eight kids and one of them dies that's a terrible tragedy

75
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,200
but the other seven will you know more or less grow up and

76
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120
have their own kids and in a few generations things will be roughly back

77
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,240
to normal it sounds harsh and maybe it is harsh

78
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,800
the world's a harsh place I'm not saying that I don't have

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,600
feelings for these mothers who have lost children

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,200
but when you when you only have a few kids at the end of your

81
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,360
reliably fertile period you have really put all your eggs in one basket

82
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,240
there are some advantages to that you know you can devote more resources to

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,800
them maybe maybe with your eight kids some

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
kids are going hungry more than they should

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,760
something like that maybe you can afford to send them to a better school maybe

86
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,880
the family christmas is a bit more of a cheerier time because there's more gifts

87
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,880
to be to be passed around but at the same time you have every

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,480
incentive to helicopter parent if you only have one or two kids you

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,680
have every incentive to to really I don't know overbear on them and

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
really try to ensure that everything goes perfectly for them

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
and that's why you see the rise of things like parents who get really

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,280
gung-ho about their kids baseball or football careers you know

93
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,560
whatever career it is when they're nine years old playing with other kids or

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
like playing in a local league or something you know they get they get

95
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,960
really into it well because they can kind of afford to do that they

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,040
have the resources to do that and they have the

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,960
the mindset to do that it's why you see parents complaining to the teacher

98
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
rather than their kids when their kids start failing at school

99
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,360
because of this helicoptering overprotective

100
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,040
this is my one chance so I better make this kid count kind of mentality

101
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,880
and you know over the course of 20 years or 25 years or 30 years

102
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,360
this this movement has been like a wave through demographics it's gone through

103
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
preschool it's gone through primary school it's gone through high school

104
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,280
and now it's in the universities and the universities um to their discredit they

105
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,240
should have put their foot down they should have said no no your kids are 18

106
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,000
when they're coming here they're adults now

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,040
you no longer get to helicopter parent them you no longer get to baby them

108
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,640
you no longer get to email professors and harass them because your kid failed

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,120
their class you no longer get to have safe spaces

110
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,280
when you come on campus because hey this is a place of learning this is a

111
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,480
place of discussing at difficult topics but when enough people complain and

112
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,680
those people are paying money well that's the way things go so you end

113
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,520
up with a generation basically of simps there's no other way to put it they're

114
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,640
they're like a softened generation they're snowflakes that have have

115
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,000
tantrums and meltdowns and they're constantly triggered whenever something

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,320
that they don't personally like happens to

117
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,520
them or is said around them and now the workplace is having to adapt

118
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,400
to this stuff I bet HR departments are making a killing right now

119
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
but it really seems like this all kind of spawned from birth control in a sense

120
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,720
since it created a culture of parents who really only had

121
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,400
one shot to be a parent and they invested everything they had in making

122
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,240
that right and so now you have a generation of

123
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
people who have been who have been coddled

124
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,120
and catered to and who can't really grasp why things don't go their way

125
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
they view their own failings as society's personal attack on them

126
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,040
and oftentimes they'll turn to various totalitarian ideologies as adults

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,160
to try and fill in the gaps rather than simply taking responsibility for their

128
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
own failures and the generation I'm talking about

129
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,000
is my generation and I have to be honest um there was once a point where I was

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,640
like this too I had to really grow out of it in my

131
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
20s because it was holding me back in life

132
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,560
it would seem to me that women having control of their reproduction

133
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
was as big of a change at least demographically as the invention of the

134
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,200
computer was for technology or communication or as

135
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,840
the invention of the atom bomb was for war

136
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,160
birth control was that for human biology we have to ask some serious questions

137
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,720
that I'm sure feminists don't really want me to ask

138
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,640
what are women now to men from a strictly biological sense

139
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't mean socially I mean we're still going to treat each other as if we are

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,880
the genders that we are but I mean biologically before men

141
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,160
had at least a basic understanding of what women were and that

142
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,400
basic understanding as terrible as it might sound to our modern sensibilities

143
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,320
was the person that you have sex with and create children with

144
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,920
but if they are not that anymore biologically

145
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,720
what what are they do we even know it's almost like humanity has become a

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
different species in a sense so many species are identified by their

147
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,240
reproductive patterns and we have radically changed ours using

148
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,520
our own technology we've changed what women are attracted to using our own

149
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,680
technology and in the human species women have

150
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
always been the sexual selector so what does that mean for us the helicopter

151
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,040
parenting culture was the impetus that caused every major

152
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,160
structure from school to the universities to the workplace to

153
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,760
value safety over personal freedom and if safety is the name of the game

154
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,680
well then you have all of these various oppressed minorities and groups all

155
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
jockeying for their own safe space all talking about how the heteronormative

156
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,760
capitalist patriarchy is oppressing them and needs to be done away with and

157
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,040
demanding other people's freedoms be curtailed in order to get the job done

158
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,960
in the name of safety and and you have to ask where has that left us

159
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,000
if the radical left's view of all hierarchies being corrupt

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,040
is just taken as a given fact at this point

161
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,000
what is the natural end result of that well that would mean that hierarchies

162
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
that are just don't exist and it's all just

163
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,120
power politics and that would mean that those people who have

164
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,760
traditional aspirations are also corrupt women like the tried wives we've talked

165
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
about before are simply gender traitors and men are

166
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,560
simply abusive patriarchs looking to take their place within that corrupt

167
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
hierarchy if you spend an entire generation

168
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,840
telling boys and girls this message and then you start to tailor both the

169
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,120
workplace and the school in this direction as well

170
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,160
you end up with a generation of dissatisfied women who can't seem to

171
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,600
find men that meet their standards and depressed men who don't know what

172
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,040
to do with their lives and judging by the former's complaints

173
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
and the latter's suicide rate it would seem like this is the case

174
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,760
but at the same time the whole idea doesn't really make any sense does it

175
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,040
because no feminist will ever complain when a woman takes on one of those

176
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,040
corrupt patriarchal roles you know you see a woman's ceo or you

177
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,160
see a woman superhero like captain marvel or something acting the way that

178
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,640
superman would it seems to be completely fine for a

179
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,480
woman to take on this corrupt role and become a patriarch herself

180
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,760
it's good for her to do it but but men can't do it it's an inherently

181
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,480
contradictory philosophy and i would say that it's because the

182
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,680
philosophy itself is not really meant to be understood

183
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,840
it's only meant to destroy things at the same time the left is correct on

184
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,720
some level about hierarchies in in ways that the

185
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,000
right wing generally can't accept conservatives like hierarchies and they

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,080
don't really seem to understand just how corrupt hierarchies can get if

187
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,360
you're not keeping a proper eye out sometimes the corruption the sjws

188
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,120
complain about actually does exist but their solution of destroying the

189
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,360
hierarchy itself doesn't help anyone it in fact makes the situation worse

190
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,720
people are on some level built to take their place

191
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,080
in a non-corrupt hierarchy because it ultimately isn't about being

192
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:46,480
in a hierarchy of stacked up people like a corporate hierarchy or something

193
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
it's more about the hierarchy of the individual what you value for your life

194
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,080
what you aim at what you aspire to be and if you take away that hierarchy you

195
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,720
can no longer rank order what you prefer and what you

196
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,440
don't prefer when you destroy the hierarchy you destroy

197
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,520
aspiration itself and without that there's no possibility of self-improvement

198
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,120
if there's no way to judge what possible future you is the better one

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,640
how could you possibly move into the future these same people radical

200
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
feminists social justice warriors they often overlap with the marxists who

201
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,800
talk about the dreaded one percent let's be honest here the one percent is

202
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,840
somebody who makes more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year i think

203
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,960
that's the number because most people in the world live in abject poverty and if

204
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,600
you make more than thirty two thousand u.s dollars a year

205
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,600
um you are making more money than 99 of people in the world

206
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
that seems to be the proper cutoff line for the dreaded one percent

207
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
so why is it that all of these people these people who can afford to go to

208
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,840
these universities these these sociology professors these these

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,760
gender studies professors and whatever else

210
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,960
all people who are making way more money than that usually unless you're going to

211
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,760
school on a loan and if you're going to school on a loan

212
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
for gender studies maybe you should rethink your life

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,280
but all of these people are already in the one percent all of these bougie

214
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,560
socialists and communists they actually just hate people who are

215
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,840
rich they don't care about poor people at all they just want to take out their

216
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,720
jealousy on those who have been more successful than they are

217
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,760
there's a joke that actually floats around academic circles at least it did

218
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,640
back when i was in school maybe maybe the HR department has snuffed it out

219
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,400
if you quadruple the pay of a university teacher all of this multicultural

220
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,960
indoctrination will disappear because what you have

221
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,280
right now are a bunch of people in academia

222
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,520
who are just hyper intelligent but really have nothing going for them

223
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,680
with the exception of their intelligence and so they are just pissed that people

224
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,040
who are working out in like the more capitalist spaces of society

225
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,320
make more money than them you might say that i've gone off topic from the whole

226
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,520
birth control thing maybe i have a little bit but i definitely think they're

227
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
connected i think what's happened is that we

228
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,960
haven't properly adapted to the invention of the birth control we

229
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,360
haven't changed our our viewpoints and even in some

230
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
senses our culture to properly deal with what birth control

231
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
means basically we've been using old rules for a fundamentally new game

232
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,840
and the end result of that has filtered down through everything

233
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,120
into academia into the media into the workplace

234
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
and this drive towards equality and safety

235
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,400
and away from personal freedom and liberty has come about

236
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,240
basically because we have become so successful

237
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,680
that we can afford to be soft in that manner at least in the short term

238
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,040
i think if this stuff doesn't stop it will destroy our society eventually

239
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
but in the short term we can afford to be

240
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,200
a little bit of a softened generation because we're no longer dealing with the

241
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,440
same problems that we were dealing with 100 years ago

242
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,720
coronavirus seems to be a pretty big deal but i highly doubt it's going to

243
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,840
turn into like the next black death it's very unlikely we're going to

244
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,120
actually see a world war 3 despite whatever has been going on with the

245
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,160
climate the possibility of a serious famine

246
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,360
seems to be rather low right now it almost seems

247
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,560
like our own ingenuity has solved so many problems

248
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,920
that now the stuff that we're collectively complaining about is

249
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,360
not being comfortable enough or being too offended on the internet

250
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
or somebody coming to university and saying something that you don't like

251
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,240
human beings are in a sense pack animals we need a load to lift if we're going to

252
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
feel any kind of meaning in our lives and since a lot of the larger problems

253
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,520
have been solved maybe maybe all we have left to do is

254
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,120
complain about small problems problems that frankly shouldn't even be

255
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
complained about due to the whole freedom and liberty thing

256
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,880
and i really do think that that part of that

257
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,600
cultural shift came about because of the impact of the birth control pill

258
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,280
what it did to reproduction and then what our reproduction did to the society

259
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,760
in which we live
