00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
A clever few of you noticed that, in my last video, I mentioned a thing called the Pronouns

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
Wiki.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
And yeah, that's real.

00:13.280 --> 00:17.920
I was confused about the difference between Neopronouns and Xenopronouns.

00:17.920 --> 00:21.640
Neopronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that were directly created or adapted

00:21.640 --> 00:25.380
within the language instead of evolving with it, and are frequently not officially recognized

00:25.380 --> 00:26.720
in the language they're used in.

00:26.720 --> 00:31.780
In English, there are four sets of recognized exipronouns, she-her is considered feminine,

00:31.780 --> 00:36.080
he-him is considered masculine, and they-them is considered neutral, and less controversial

00:36.080 --> 00:37.920
than the fourth set, it-its.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.240
In my original recording of that passage before doing another take, I expressed shock at the

00:42.240 --> 00:45.680
existence of the word exipronouns, but I let that hook dangle.

00:45.680 --> 00:46.680
Not today, though!

00:46.680 --> 00:49.720
Let's fully dive down the rabbit hole of the Pronouns Wiki.

00:49.720 --> 00:55.120
Exipronouns, also called Palaeopronouns, archpronouns, or tradpronouns, is a term to refer to the

00:55.120 --> 00:58.800
standard traditional existing pronoun sets of a language.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.760
Someone who uses exipronouns would be called exipronominal, oh jesus christ.

01:03.760 --> 01:10.760
The term exipronoun was coined by Tumblr user anacrossic on June 30th, 2020.

01:10.760 --> 01:15.400
Also on that post, tradpronouns was coined by Tumblr user transkian.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.400
Why is this a wiki?

01:16.400 --> 01:18.200
Like, why does this thing exist?

01:18.200 --> 01:20.720
Is it just to document Tumblr stupidity?

01:20.720 --> 01:23.280
Here's what Xenopronouns actually means.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.940
Xenopronouns are a type of hypothetical neopronouns that cannot be understood by humans and or

01:28.940 --> 01:31.560
expressed through human language.

01:31.560 --> 01:35.960
Theoretical examples of xenopronouns include pronouns that involve concepts that humans

01:35.960 --> 01:41.320
don't have words for, pronouns whose meanings cannot be translated into any human language,

01:41.320 --> 01:45.480
pronouns that include sounds that would be impossible for humans to make if spoken, pronouns

01:45.480 --> 01:50.800
that include movements that would be impossible for humans to do if signed, pronouns expressed

01:50.800 --> 01:53.920
through a form of communication that humans can't use.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.920
If I were trans, I would be fucking embarrassed at this, I'm not gonna lie.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.640
Like let's say you're the average trans woman, okay?

02:00.640 --> 02:04.000
You're born male, and as you get a bit older you're attracted to more feminine things,

02:04.000 --> 02:07.400
you view yourself as a bit more feminine, you get pushback from those around you for

02:07.400 --> 02:11.520
this and it makes you feel bad, you get older still, and you realize you want to present

02:11.520 --> 02:14.000
and behave as the other gender, and eventually you do.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.600
You're not interested in any of this crazy shit, you don't want to deconstruct gender,

02:17.600 --> 02:21.320
you don't want to be viewed as an eldritch abomination from beyond the stars, unknowable

02:21.320 --> 02:25.480
by normal human minds, you just want the other gender identity than the one that aligns with

02:25.480 --> 02:26.480
their biological sex.

02:26.480 --> 02:31.800
I think this is why the most successful, popular and emotionally stable trans women present

02:31.800 --> 02:33.600
and behave like cis women.

02:33.600 --> 02:38.080
No specific examples of xenopronouns can be provided because, by their nature, it would

02:38.080 --> 02:40.720
be impossible to express through human language.

02:40.720 --> 02:46.160
For those that do use xenopronouns, for communication in human language they may use auxiliary or

02:46.160 --> 02:51.320
alternate pronouns, or wish to be treated as null-pronomenal, oh what fresh hell is

02:51.320 --> 02:52.320
this?

02:52.320 --> 02:57.240
Null-pronomenal, also known as non-pronomenal, un-pronomenal, a-pronomenal, pronounless,

02:57.240 --> 03:03.480
void-pronoun, or impronoun, is the act of not using third person pronouns of any kind.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.440
Oh my god, they've got flags for all of this shit too.

03:06.440 --> 03:11.160
You know, for being so anti-nationalist, leftoids love to divide themselves up into camps and

03:11.160 --> 03:13.900
wave banners signifying their allegiance.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.620
The Phrae-pronomenal flag by fandom user femboyquinn.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.260
What the fuck is Phrae-pronomenal?

03:20.260 --> 03:25.960
It is a form of pronoun non-conformity and may be considered a de-human pronoun depending

03:25.960 --> 03:26.960
on the user.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.780
What the fuck is a de-human pronoun?

03:28.780 --> 03:32.620
Being non-pronomenal may overlap with name-self pronouns.

03:32.620 --> 03:34.500
What the fuck is name-self pronouns?

03:34.500 --> 03:39.140
I wanted to go back to the auxiliary pronouns page from the last passage, but every link

03:39.140 --> 03:42.580
I click on, there's three more terms I don't understand.

03:42.580 --> 03:45.340
This is worse than link-surfing on TV-tropes.

03:45.340 --> 03:49.660
Denny-pronomial is a term for someone who is normally null-pronomial but occasionally

03:49.660 --> 03:50.980
uses pronouns.

03:50.980 --> 03:55.860
This may overlap with one being pronoun fluid, however it doesn't have to.

03:55.860 --> 03:59.540
I'm going to guess that pronoun fluid is that you change your pronouns sometimes, right?

03:59.540 --> 04:04.980
Pronoun fluid is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time.

04:04.980 --> 04:09.100
One's pronouns may change over the course of hours, days, weeks, or months, and the

04:09.100 --> 04:12.860
gender of the person does not matter and does not have to change with the pronouns.

04:12.860 --> 04:18.740
Oh, okay, so you can be a girl, fully biologically female, gender is woman, not even a trans

04:18.740 --> 04:23.020
man, you're a cis woman, and you can use he-him pronouns because you're pronoun non-conforming.

04:23.020 --> 04:26.760
Wait a second, pronoun non-conforming is something different, it's just using pronouns in a

04:26.760 --> 04:27.760
non-standard way.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.140
Okay, okay, what I'm talking about is what this wiki calls cross-pronominal.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.140
Fuck me, dude.

04:33.140 --> 04:37.140
The cross-pronominal flag looks like a candy you might have found in a cheap paper bag

04:37.140 --> 04:38.700
at the corner store back in the day.

04:38.700 --> 04:42.100
It was made by Beyond Mogai Pride Flags.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.180
Is this your greatest contribution, dude?

04:44.180 --> 04:47.780
Making these fucking flags that will never actually fly anywhere IRL?

04:47.780 --> 04:49.060
Is this how you spend your time?

04:49.060 --> 04:51.820
Alright, let's jump a few stages back.

04:51.820 --> 04:54.460
Cross-pronominal to pronoun non-conforming to pronoun fluid.

04:54.460 --> 05:01.260
Core fluid, no, core fluid is a term for someone who is both gender fluid and pronoun fluid,

05:01.260 --> 05:04.540
and whose pronouns change to correlate with their gender.

05:04.540 --> 05:10.660
Pronoun fluid, also known as neofluid, is when one is pronoun fluid only between neopronouns.

05:10.660 --> 05:16.980
A neofluid individual may also have exipronouns so long as they are only fluid in neopronouns.

05:16.980 --> 05:25.740
Muto-pronoun, or mutopronominal, is a term used to describe when one's pronouns change

05:25.740 --> 05:27.420
in certain situations or contexts.

05:27.420 --> 05:28.740
Okay, this one I kind of understand.

05:28.740 --> 05:33.300
It's like how drag queens out of drag use he and him, but use she-her in drag.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.300
I've got it.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.780
The reason, though, is because Naomi likes to watch Drag Race.

05:36.780 --> 05:42.420
Emotopronounfluid, also known as emotopronominal, is a subset of pronoun fluid where one's

05:42.420 --> 05:45.780
pronouns change depending on one's mood, emotions, or state of mind.

05:45.780 --> 05:50.260
Oh, is this the source of the was-were joke, when your state of mind is dead?

05:50.260 --> 05:54.380
Pronoun fae, or pronoun doe, is the act of switching or transitioning between two or

05:54.380 --> 05:58.100
more pronoun sets over time, but only feminine pronouns.

05:58.100 --> 06:03.920
Pronoun fawn, or pronoun fawn, is the act of switching or transitioning between two

06:03.920 --> 06:08.000
or more pronoun sets over time, but only masculine pronouns.

06:08.000 --> 06:14.160
Um, excuse me, but the very act of even considering pronoun sets masculine or feminine is inherently

06:14.160 --> 06:15.160
oppressive.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.160
Thank you very much.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.600
Pronoun floor is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time,

06:20.600 --> 06:21.920
but only neutral pronouns.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.200
Oh, I guess they already have that one covered.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.520
Pronoun soros is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time,

06:29.520 --> 06:31.400
but only androgynous pronouns.

06:31.400 --> 06:34.240
It actually sounds more like dinosaur pronouns, frankly.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.240
Pronoun soros people can have any gender.

06:36.240 --> 06:42.380
For example, a pronoun floor person may go by she shim one day and shy hire the next,

06:42.380 --> 06:44.480
and then a week later switch back to she shim.

06:44.480 --> 06:47.520
Oh my god, what is the fucking point?

06:47.520 --> 06:50.760
Why does she shim have an entry but shy hire doesn't?

06:50.760 --> 06:54.840
I can actually kind of intuit what she shim means as an androgynous thing, but I actually

06:54.840 --> 06:58.000
want an explanation of where the fuck shy hire came from.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.520
Also, look at the bottom of this page, coined on December 13th, 2021, coined on November

07:02.520 --> 07:06.080
1st, 2020, January 7th, 2022, October 2021.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.680
These are just people who have been locked down for too long during coronavirus and have

07:09.680 --> 07:11.120
had nothing to do.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.860
Fray-pronomenal is a term for people who lose their connection to a set of pronouns the

07:14.860 --> 07:18.720
more the set is used to refer to them, and become more likely to change their pronouns

07:18.720 --> 07:20.400
as a result of this lost connection.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.940
In other words, after a set of pronouns gets old, you change them.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.680
This is literally just being a special snowflake.

07:24.680 --> 07:30.920
Jesus Christ, there's libra-pronomenal, hemi-pronomenal, grey-pronomenal, proxy-pronomenal, CAD-pronomenal,

07:30.920 --> 07:35.320
someone who was allo-pronomenal but no longer relates to pronouns due to past trauma.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.640
Is this even possible?

07:36.640 --> 07:38.240
Like, how would this happen?

07:38.240 --> 07:41.840
Would a rapist have to write the person's pronouns on their dick before he does it?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.400
Meyer-pronomenal, mere-pronomenal, someone who has multiple null-pronomenal labels.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.000
Yeah, we covered null-pronomenal earlier, didn't we?

07:51.000 --> 07:55.120
Null-pronomenal is the act of not using third-person pronouns of any kind, right, right.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.600
If you're not using any pronouns, how are you fucking using multiples of them?

07:59.600 --> 08:00.600
Multiples of nothing?

08:00.600 --> 08:04.280
You know, after all of this, that auxiliary pronouns page I wanted to check out earlier

08:04.280 --> 08:06.240
seems quaint by comparison.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.760
Auxiliary pronouns, also known as alternate pronouns, are a pronoun set or sets that one

08:10.760 --> 08:15.080
likes less than their primary pronoun set, but still allows others to use to refer to

08:15.080 --> 08:16.080
oneself.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.080
Yeah, this is just the whole she-they thing that you see on Twitter sometimes.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.160
Where...

08:20.160 --> 08:22.200
Emoji self-pronouns?

08:22.200 --> 08:23.560
Emoji self-pronouns.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.160
Emoji self-pronouns are a form of gender-neutral neo-pronouns.

08:26.160 --> 08:30.800
They are similar to noun self-pronouns, but instead of using letters, they use emojis

08:30.800 --> 08:31.800
or other pictograms.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.180
They may be used for a number of reasons, such as liking the way the emoji looks, liking

08:36.180 --> 08:40.480
the way they may sound in their head, or because one feels the emoji describes them or reflects

08:40.480 --> 08:41.960
something about their gender well.

08:41.960 --> 08:46.000
Emoji self-pronouns are meant to be used in text-based communication only.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.920
They cannot be pronounced and are not intended to be pronounced, but some may have spoken

08:49.920 --> 08:50.920
alternatives.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.560
I'm trying my best not to laugh here, guys.

08:52.560 --> 08:56.960
Most emoji pronoun users have pronouns to be used in spoken conversation.

08:56.960 --> 09:01.800
Some emoji pronoun users will use a noun self-pronoun set based on the emoji.

09:01.800 --> 09:06.800
Other emoji self-pronoun users may use pronouns like he, she, they, or other pronouns that

09:06.800 --> 09:09.400
are unrelated to the emoji in spoken conversation.

09:09.400 --> 09:13.480
Others may go by no pronouns in speech.

09:13.480 --> 09:19.720
An example of emoji self-pronouns is, this is if the pronoun is a strawberry emoji.

09:19.720 --> 09:20.720
Strawberry went to the store.

09:20.720 --> 09:21.720
You're not supposed to say it.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.360
You're supposed to have the picture of the strawberry emoji in your head, I guess.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.360
Strawberry went to the store.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.440
I met strawberry today.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.560
Berry walked berry's dog today.

09:29.560 --> 09:34.720
Spoken alternatives to the above set of emoji self-pronouns could be be b berry self straw

09:34.720 --> 09:37.560
strawberry self fruit fruit self.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.880
Yeah, I would not be surprised if you were a fucking fruit, dude.

09:40.920 --> 09:45.440
The noun self-pronouns page that we skipped over, though, brings us full circle.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.840
Noun self-pronouns are a type of neo pronouns that are clearly derived from a pre-existing

09:49.840 --> 09:52.880
word to be used as a gender neutral pronoun set.

09:52.880 --> 09:57.120
Any word can be turned into a pronoun set, so this allows there to be theoretically infinite

09:57.120 --> 09:58.720
sets of noun self-pronouns.

09:58.720 --> 10:01.480
The word in question does not have to be a noun.

10:01.480 --> 10:02.600
Oh, all right.

10:02.600 --> 10:07.620
Some of the earliest sets of noun self-pronouns are the fairy themed set fe fair and the bunny

10:07.620 --> 10:09.680
themed set bun buns.

10:09.680 --> 10:13.160
And of course we now have dog self, cat self, and many others.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.640
Remember the deer gender people that hit the spotlight a year or so ago?

10:15.640 --> 10:16.640
Nice and soft.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.240
Round to the back of the head.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.240
Yeah, them.

10:22.240 --> 10:26.120
I think they use doe doe self-pronouns, and I'm guessing they're part of this shit.

10:26.120 --> 10:30.280
The issue with fad pronouns like these isn't that they're artificially constructed and

10:30.280 --> 10:32.200
socially imposed for a political benefit.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.240
Well, no, that is the issue, but there's a bigger issue.

10:34.240 --> 10:37.640
It's that it adds a new unnecessary dimension of complexity.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.320
I can already hear the progressive reply to this herder.

10:40.320 --> 10:43.460
You can remember hundreds of Pokemon, but you can't remember a couple dozen pronouns.

10:43.460 --> 10:44.460
That doesn't matter.

10:44.460 --> 10:48.220
Trust grows when you don't have to think about something and you can just simplify it.

10:48.220 --> 10:51.560
We do this to objects and we do it to each other, and it's not bad that we do this.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.040
It's in our nature as tribals.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.320
We didn't need to know the intricate details of the biology of the tiger that is about

10:56.320 --> 10:57.320
to eat us.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.640
We simplify it to big roar teeth scary when I trade with you, I don't need to know your

11:01.640 --> 11:03.480
life story and you don't need to know mine.

11:03.480 --> 11:07.340
If I hire you to build my house, I don't need to know every detail of how you grew up and

11:07.340 --> 11:10.080
became interested in building houses and who taught you how to do it.

11:10.080 --> 11:13.340
I just need to know that you can do the job that I pay for and you just need to know that

11:13.340 --> 11:14.420
I can pay you for it.

11:14.420 --> 11:18.580
For some things, you may need a bit more detail, but you never need to know all of the detail.

11:18.580 --> 11:21.780
I may need to see the credentials of somebody who's building a very complex house.

11:21.780 --> 11:25.380
I may need to see examples of his prior work, but I will never need to hook myself up to

11:25.380 --> 11:29.940
his brain and experience second by second the entire process of how he learned to do

11:29.940 --> 11:30.940
it.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.940
Trust may come from knowing somebody intimately, for example, in a romantic context, but trust

11:34.940 --> 11:39.300
between business partners, between citizens, between friends comes from not needing to

11:39.300 --> 11:42.780
know, from simplifying the other person in your eyes so that you only need to engage

11:42.780 --> 11:45.500
with the public part of themselves that they put forward.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.520
Everything else can remain private and unknown, and that's okay.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.740
We evolved to handle complex environments by simplifying what we can trust.

11:52.740 --> 11:56.580
That's why we say, I trust him, he'd never betray me, even if he actually has the capacity

11:56.580 --> 11:57.580
for betrayal.

11:57.580 --> 12:00.820
Because what you're doing is you're taking a leap of faith and assuming that all of those

12:00.820 --> 12:03.340
possible futures where he betrays you won't happen.

12:03.340 --> 12:07.880
Even if they could happen, resources spent on fallback plans can be better spent elsewhere.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.220
So if your trust isn't misplaced, that's less time spent on the possibility of being betrayed

12:12.220 --> 12:14.360
and more time spent on your actual goal.

12:14.360 --> 12:18.840
This is why high trust societies end up more prosperous than low trust ones, regardless

12:18.840 --> 12:23.400
of access to resources, because you're spending way less time on periphery plans that are

12:23.400 --> 12:25.560
only relevant if you get backstabbed.

12:25.560 --> 12:30.020
All of these crazy gender identities and pronouns, and moreover the strict insistence on their

12:30.020 --> 12:34.860
constant use, adds unnecessary complexity, which adds chaos, which reduces trust.

12:34.860 --> 12:39.040
I don't need to know the gender, or the biological sex for that matter, of the person who's serving

12:39.040 --> 12:40.900
me food or scanning my groceries.

12:40.900 --> 12:45.660
And including this stuff as a necessary component of the interaction, bogs down that interaction.

12:45.660 --> 12:50.580
Some people take glee at the idea of breaking other people's automated cognitive processes.

12:50.580 --> 12:53.840
Fair enough, subversion can be fun, being the outsider can make you feel special.

12:53.840 --> 12:58.220
But those same people also complain about not being accepted, or how people treat them

12:58.220 --> 12:59.700
weirdly and how it's everyone else's problem.

13:00.380 --> 13:04.100
And it's like, yes, what do you think is the natural end result of breaking people's

13:04.100 --> 13:05.500
automated cognitive scripts?

13:05.500 --> 13:08.740
You're not being abused, you're breaking the mold, and then complaining that you no

13:08.740 --> 13:10.460
longer have a mold that contains you.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.180
Shut up and do your fucking dishes.

13:12.180 --> 13:14.060
Here's my final take on it.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.360
Men and women, fine.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.900
Trans men, trans women, also okay.

13:16.900 --> 13:21.260
I can completely understand adhering to regular gender norms and just wanting the other one.

13:21.260 --> 13:25.100
Feeling both masculine and feminine at the same time, I can see that, sure.

13:25.100 --> 13:28.900
Feeling agender, like you don't align with either man or woman, fine, okay.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.620
Men, woman, both, neither.

13:30.620 --> 13:35.420
I can conceive of these options existing, even if the options for biological sex are

13:35.420 --> 13:39.060
literally only male, female, and various deformities.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.900
But all this other nonsense is just meaningless garbage.

13:41.900 --> 13:46.600
The legitimate options already map on perfectly to he, she, and they, as is.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.940
Deer gender, cat gender, whatever, none of that shit is fucking real.

13:49.940 --> 13:53.240
These people have debilitating, crippling mental illnesses that are preventing them

13:53.240 --> 13:55.420
from being happy and joining normal society.
