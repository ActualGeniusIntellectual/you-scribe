1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,280
A clever few of you noticed that, in my last video, I mentioned a thing called the Pronouns

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Wiki.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
And yeah, that's real.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,920
I was confused about the difference between Neopronouns and Xenopronouns.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,640
Neopronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that were directly created or adapted

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,380
within the language instead of evolving with it, and are frequently not officially recognized

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,720
in the language they're used in.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,780
In English, there are four sets of recognized exipronouns, she-her is considered feminine,

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,080
he-him is considered masculine, and they-them is considered neutral, and less controversial

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,920
than the fourth set, it-its.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,240
In my original recording of that passage before doing another take, I expressed shock at the

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,680
existence of the word exipronouns, but I let that hook dangle.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,680
Not today, though!

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,720
Let's fully dive down the rabbit hole of the Pronouns Wiki.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:55,120
Exipronouns, also called Palaeopronouns, archpronouns, or tradpronouns, is a term to refer to the

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,800
standard traditional existing pronoun sets of a language.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,760
Someone who uses exipronouns would be called exipronominal, oh jesus christ.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,760
The term exipronoun was coined by Tumblr user anacrossic on June 30th, 2020.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,400
Also on that post, tradpronouns was coined by Tumblr user transkian.

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,400
Why is this a wiki?

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,200
Like, why does this thing exist?

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,720
Is it just to document Tumblr stupidity?

23
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,280
Here's what Xenopronouns actually means.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,940
Xenopronouns are a type of hypothetical neopronouns that cannot be understood by humans and or

25
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,560
expressed through human language.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,960
Theoretical examples of xenopronouns include pronouns that involve concepts that humans

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,320
don't have words for, pronouns whose meanings cannot be translated into any human language,

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,480
pronouns that include sounds that would be impossible for humans to make if spoken, pronouns

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,800
that include movements that would be impossible for humans to do if signed, pronouns expressed

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,920
through a form of communication that humans can't use.

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,920
If I were trans, I would be fucking embarrassed at this, I'm not gonna lie.

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Like let's say you're the average trans woman, okay?

33
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
You're born male, and as you get a bit older you're attracted to more feminine things,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,400
you view yourself as a bit more feminine, you get pushback from those around you for

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,520
this and it makes you feel bad, you get older still, and you realize you want to present

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
and behave as the other gender, and eventually you do.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,600
You're not interested in any of this crazy shit, you don't want to deconstruct gender,

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,320
you don't want to be viewed as an eldritch abomination from beyond the stars, unknowable

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,480
by normal human minds, you just want the other gender identity than the one that aligns with

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,480
their biological sex.

41
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,800
I think this is why the most successful, popular and emotionally stable trans women present

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,600
and behave like cis women.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,080
No specific examples of xenopronouns can be provided because, by their nature, it would

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,720
be impossible to express through human language.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,160
For those that do use xenopronouns, for communication in human language they may use auxiliary or

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,320
alternate pronouns, or wish to be treated as null-pronomenal, oh what fresh hell is

47
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
this?

48
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,240
Null-pronomenal, also known as non-pronomenal, un-pronomenal, a-pronomenal, pronounless,

49
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:03,480
void-pronoun, or impronoun, is the act of not using third person pronouns of any kind.

50
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,440
Oh my god, they've got flags for all of this shit too.

51
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,160
You know, for being so anti-nationalist, leftoids love to divide themselves up into camps and

52
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,900
wave banners signifying their allegiance.

53
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,620
The Phrae-pronomenal flag by fandom user femboyquinn.

54
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,260
What the fuck is Phrae-pronomenal?

55
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,960
It is a form of pronoun non-conformity and may be considered a de-human pronoun depending

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,960
on the user.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,780
What the fuck is a de-human pronoun?

58
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,620
Being non-pronomenal may overlap with name-self pronouns.

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,500
What the fuck is name-self pronouns?

60
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,140
I wanted to go back to the auxiliary pronouns page from the last passage, but every link

61
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,580
I click on, there's three more terms I don't understand.

62
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,340
This is worse than link-surfing on TV-tropes.

63
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,660
Denny-pronomial is a term for someone who is normally null-pronomial but occasionally

64
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,980
uses pronouns.

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,860
This may overlap with one being pronoun fluid, however it doesn't have to.

66
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,540
I'm going to guess that pronoun fluid is that you change your pronouns sometimes, right?

67
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,980
Pronoun fluid is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time.

68
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,100
One's pronouns may change over the course of hours, days, weeks, or months, and the

69
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,860
gender of the person does not matter and does not have to change with the pronouns.

70
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,740
Oh, okay, so you can be a girl, fully biologically female, gender is woman, not even a trans

71
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,020
man, you're a cis woman, and you can use he-him pronouns because you're pronoun non-conforming.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,760
Wait a second, pronoun non-conforming is something different, it's just using pronouns in a

73
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
non-standard way.

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,140
Okay, okay, what I'm talking about is what this wiki calls cross-pronominal.

75
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,140
Fuck me, dude.

76
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,140
The cross-pronominal flag looks like a candy you might have found in a cheap paper bag

77
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,700
at the corner store back in the day.

78
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,100
It was made by Beyond Mogai Pride Flags.

79
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,180
Is this your greatest contribution, dude?

80
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,780
Making these fucking flags that will never actually fly anywhere IRL?

81
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,060
Is this how you spend your time?

82
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,820
Alright, let's jump a few stages back.

83
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,460
Cross-pronominal to pronoun non-conforming to pronoun fluid.

84
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:01,260
Core fluid, no, core fluid is a term for someone who is both gender fluid and pronoun fluid,

85
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,540
and whose pronouns change to correlate with their gender.

86
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:10,660
Pronoun fluid, also known as neofluid, is when one is pronoun fluid only between neopronouns.

87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:16,980
A neofluid individual may also have exipronouns so long as they are only fluid in neopronouns.

88
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:25,740
Muto-pronoun, or mutopronominal, is a term used to describe when one's pronouns change

89
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,420
in certain situations or contexts.

90
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,740
Okay, this one I kind of understand.

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,300
It's like how drag queens out of drag use he and him, but use she-her in drag.

92
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,300
I've got it.

93
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,780
The reason, though, is because Naomi likes to watch Drag Race.

94
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,420
Emotopronounfluid, also known as emotopronominal, is a subset of pronoun fluid where one's

95
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:45,780
pronouns change depending on one's mood, emotions, or state of mind.

96
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,260
Oh, is this the source of the was-were joke, when your state of mind is dead?

97
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,380
Pronoun fae, or pronoun doe, is the act of switching or transitioning between two or

98
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,100
more pronoun sets over time, but only feminine pronouns.

99
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,920
Pronoun fawn, or pronoun fawn, is the act of switching or transitioning between two

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,000
or more pronoun sets over time, but only masculine pronouns.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,160
Um, excuse me, but the very act of even considering pronoun sets masculine or feminine is inherently

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
oppressive.

103
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Thank you very much.

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,600
Pronoun floor is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time,

105
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,920
but only neutral pronouns.

106
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,200
Oh, I guess they already have that one covered.

107
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,520
Pronoun soros is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time,

108
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,400
but only androgynous pronouns.

109
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,240
It actually sounds more like dinosaur pronouns, frankly.

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
Pronoun soros people can have any gender.

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,380
For example, a pronoun floor person may go by she shim one day and shy hire the next,

112
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,480
and then a week later switch back to she shim.

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,520
Oh my god, what is the fucking point?

114
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,760
Why does she shim have an entry but shy hire doesn't?

115
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,840
I can actually kind of intuit what she shim means as an androgynous thing, but I actually

116
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,000
want an explanation of where the fuck shy hire came from.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,520
Also, look at the bottom of this page, coined on December 13th, 2021, coined on November

118
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,080
1st, 2020, January 7th, 2022, October 2021.

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,680
These are just people who have been locked down for too long during coronavirus and have

120
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,120
had nothing to do.

121
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,860
Fray-pronomenal is a term for people who lose their connection to a set of pronouns the

122
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,720
more the set is used to refer to them, and become more likely to change their pronouns

123
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,400
as a result of this lost connection.

124
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,940
In other words, after a set of pronouns gets old, you change them.

125
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,680
This is literally just being a special snowflake.

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,920
Jesus Christ, there's libra-pronomenal, hemi-pronomenal, grey-pronomenal, proxy-pronomenal, CAD-pronomenal,

127
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,320
someone who was allo-pronomenal but no longer relates to pronouns due to past trauma.

128
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,640
Is this even possible?

129
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,240
Like, how would this happen?

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
Would a rapist have to write the person's pronouns on their dick before he does it?

131
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

132
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,400
Meyer-pronomenal, mere-pronomenal, someone who has multiple null-pronomenal labels.

133
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, we covered null-pronomenal earlier, didn't we?

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,120
Null-pronomenal is the act of not using third-person pronouns of any kind, right, right.

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,600
If you're not using any pronouns, how are you fucking using multiples of them?

136
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Multiples of nothing?

137
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,280
You know, after all of this, that auxiliary pronouns page I wanted to check out earlier

138
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,240
seems quaint by comparison.

139
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,760
Auxiliary pronouns, also known as alternate pronouns, are a pronoun set or sets that one

140
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,080
likes less than their primary pronoun set, but still allows others to use to refer to

141
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
oneself.

142
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Yeah, this is just the whole she-they thing that you see on Twitter sometimes.

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Where...

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,200
Emoji self-pronouns?

145
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,560
Emoji self-pronouns.

146
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,160
Emoji self-pronouns are a form of gender-neutral neo-pronouns.

147
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,800
They are similar to noun self-pronouns, but instead of using letters, they use emojis

148
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
or other pictograms.

149
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,180
They may be used for a number of reasons, such as liking the way the emoji looks, liking

150
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,480
the way they may sound in their head, or because one feels the emoji describes them or reflects

151
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,960
something about their gender well.

152
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,000
Emoji self-pronouns are meant to be used in text-based communication only.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,920
They cannot be pronounced and are not intended to be pronounced, but some may have spoken

154
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
alternatives.

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm trying my best not to laugh here, guys.

156
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,960
Most emoji pronoun users have pronouns to be used in spoken conversation.

157
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Some emoji pronoun users will use a noun self-pronoun set based on the emoji.

158
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Other emoji self-pronoun users may use pronouns like he, she, they, or other pronouns that

159
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,400
are unrelated to the emoji in spoken conversation.

160
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,480
Others may go by no pronouns in speech.

161
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,720
An example of emoji self-pronouns is, this is if the pronoun is a strawberry emoji.

162
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Strawberry went to the store.

163
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
You're not supposed to say it.

164
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,360
You're supposed to have the picture of the strawberry emoji in your head, I guess.

165
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
Strawberry went to the store.

166
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
I met strawberry today.

167
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,560
Berry walked berry's dog today.

168
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,720
Spoken alternatives to the above set of emoji self-pronouns could be be b berry self straw

169
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,560
strawberry self fruit fruit self.

170
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,880
Yeah, I would not be surprised if you were a fucking fruit, dude.

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,440
The noun self-pronouns page that we skipped over, though, brings us full circle.

172
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,840
Noun self-pronouns are a type of neo pronouns that are clearly derived from a pre-existing

173
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,880
word to be used as a gender neutral pronoun set.

174
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,120
Any word can be turned into a pronoun set, so this allows there to be theoretically infinite

175
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
sets of noun self-pronouns.

176
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,480
The word in question does not have to be a noun.

177
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
Oh, all right.

178
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,620
Some of the earliest sets of noun self-pronouns are the fairy themed set fe fair and the bunny

179
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,680
themed set bun buns.

180
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,160
And of course we now have dog self, cat self, and many others.

181
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,640
Remember the deer gender people that hit the spotlight a year or so ago?

182
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,640
Nice and soft.

183
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,240
Round to the back of the head.

184
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,240
Yeah, them.

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,120
I think they use doe doe self-pronouns, and I'm guessing they're part of this shit.

186
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,280
The issue with fad pronouns like these isn't that they're artificially constructed and

187
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,200
socially imposed for a political benefit.

188
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,240
Well, no, that is the issue, but there's a bigger issue.

189
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,640
It's that it adds a new unnecessary dimension of complexity.

190
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,320
I can already hear the progressive reply to this herder.

191
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,460
You can remember hundreds of Pokemon, but you can't remember a couple dozen pronouns.

192
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,460
That doesn't matter.

193
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,220
Trust grows when you don't have to think about something and you can just simplify it.

194
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,560
We do this to objects and we do it to each other, and it's not bad that we do this.

195
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,040
It's in our nature as tribals.

196
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,320
We didn't need to know the intricate details of the biology of the tiger that is about

197
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
to eat us.

198
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,640
We simplify it to big roar teeth scary when I trade with you, I don't need to know your

199
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,480
life story and you don't need to know mine.

200
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,340
If I hire you to build my house, I don't need to know every detail of how you grew up and

201
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,080
became interested in building houses and who taught you how to do it.

202
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,340
I just need to know that you can do the job that I pay for and you just need to know that

203
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,420
I can pay you for it.

204
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,580
For some things, you may need a bit more detail, but you never need to know all of the detail.

205
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,780
I may need to see the credentials of somebody who's building a very complex house.

206
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,380
I may need to see examples of his prior work, but I will never need to hook myself up to

207
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,940
his brain and experience second by second the entire process of how he learned to do

208
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,940
it.

209
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Trust may come from knowing somebody intimately, for example, in a romantic context, but trust

210
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,300
between business partners, between citizens, between friends comes from not needing to

211
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,780
know, from simplifying the other person in your eyes so that you only need to engage

212
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,500
with the public part of themselves that they put forward.

213
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,520
Everything else can remain private and unknown, and that's okay.

214
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,740
We evolved to handle complex environments by simplifying what we can trust.

215
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,580
That's why we say, I trust him, he'd never betray me, even if he actually has the capacity

216
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,580
for betrayal.

217
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,820
Because what you're doing is you're taking a leap of faith and assuming that all of those

218
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,340
possible futures where he betrays you won't happen.

219
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,880
Even if they could happen, resources spent on fallback plans can be better spent elsewhere.

220
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,220
So if your trust isn't misplaced, that's less time spent on the possibility of being betrayed

221
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,360
and more time spent on your actual goal.

222
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,840
This is why high trust societies end up more prosperous than low trust ones, regardless

223
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,400
of access to resources, because you're spending way less time on periphery plans that are

224
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,560
only relevant if you get backstabbed.

225
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,020
All of these crazy gender identities and pronouns, and moreover the strict insistence on their

226
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,860
constant use, adds unnecessary complexity, which adds chaos, which reduces trust.

227
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:39,040
I don't need to know the gender, or the biological sex for that matter, of the person who's serving

228
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,900
me food or scanning my groceries.

229
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,660
And including this stuff as a necessary component of the interaction, bogs down that interaction.

230
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,580
Some people take glee at the idea of breaking other people's automated cognitive processes.

231
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,840
Fair enough, subversion can be fun, being the outsider can make you feel special.

232
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,220
But those same people also complain about not being accepted, or how people treat them

233
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,700
weirdly and how it's everyone else's problem.

234
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,100
And it's like, yes, what do you think is the natural end result of breaking people's

235
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,500
automated cognitive scripts?

236
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,740
You're not being abused, you're breaking the mold, and then complaining that you no

237
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,460
longer have a mold that contains you.

238
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,180
Shut up and do your fucking dishes.

239
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,060
Here's my final take on it.

240
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,360
Men and women, fine.

241
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,900
Trans men, trans women, also okay.

242
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,260
I can completely understand adhering to regular gender norms and just wanting the other one.

243
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,100
Feeling both masculine and feminine at the same time, I can see that, sure.

244
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,900
Feeling agender, like you don't align with either man or woman, fine, okay.

245
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,620
Men, woman, both, neither.

246
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,420
I can conceive of these options existing, even if the options for biological sex are

247
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,060
literally only male, female, and various deformities.

248
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,900
But all this other nonsense is just meaningless garbage.

249
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,600
The legitimate options already map on perfectly to he, she, and they, as is.

250
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,940
Deer gender, cat gender, whatever, none of that shit is fucking real.

251
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,240
These people have debilitating, crippling mental illnesses that are preventing them

252
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,420
from being happy and joining normal society.
