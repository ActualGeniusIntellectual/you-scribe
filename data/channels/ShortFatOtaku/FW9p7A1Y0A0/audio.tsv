0	11280	A clever few of you noticed that, in my last video, I mentioned a thing called the Pronouns
11280	12280	Wiki.
12280	13280	And yeah, that's real.
13280	17920	I was confused about the difference between Neopronouns and Xenopronouns.
17920	21640	Neopronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that were directly created or adapted
21640	25380	within the language instead of evolving with it, and are frequently not officially recognized
25380	26720	in the language they're used in.
26720	31780	In English, there are four sets of recognized exipronouns, she-her is considered feminine,
31780	36080	he-him is considered masculine, and they-them is considered neutral, and less controversial
36080	37920	than the fourth set, it-its.
37920	42240	In my original recording of that passage before doing another take, I expressed shock at the
42240	45680	existence of the word exipronouns, but I let that hook dangle.
45680	46680	Not today, though!
46680	49720	Let's fully dive down the rabbit hole of the Pronouns Wiki.
49720	55120	Exipronouns, also called Palaeopronouns, archpronouns, or tradpronouns, is a term to refer to the
55120	58800	standard traditional existing pronoun sets of a language.
58800	63760	Someone who uses exipronouns would be called exipronominal, oh jesus christ.
63760	70760	The term exipronoun was coined by Tumblr user anacrossic on June 30th, 2020.
70760	75400	Also on that post, tradpronouns was coined by Tumblr user transkian.
75400	76400	Why is this a wiki?
76400	78200	Like, why does this thing exist?
78200	80720	Is it just to document Tumblr stupidity?
80720	83280	Here's what Xenopronouns actually means.
83280	88940	Xenopronouns are a type of hypothetical neopronouns that cannot be understood by humans and or
88940	91560	expressed through human language.
91560	95960	Theoretical examples of xenopronouns include pronouns that involve concepts that humans
95960	101320	don't have words for, pronouns whose meanings cannot be translated into any human language,
101320	105480	pronouns that include sounds that would be impossible for humans to make if spoken, pronouns
105480	110800	that include movements that would be impossible for humans to do if signed, pronouns expressed
110800	113920	through a form of communication that humans can't use.
113920	117920	If I were trans, I would be fucking embarrassed at this, I'm not gonna lie.
117920	120640	Like let's say you're the average trans woman, okay?
120640	124000	You're born male, and as you get a bit older you're attracted to more feminine things,
124000	127400	you view yourself as a bit more feminine, you get pushback from those around you for
127400	131520	this and it makes you feel bad, you get older still, and you realize you want to present
131520	134000	and behave as the other gender, and eventually you do.
134000	137600	You're not interested in any of this crazy shit, you don't want to deconstruct gender,
137600	141320	you don't want to be viewed as an eldritch abomination from beyond the stars, unknowable
141320	145480	by normal human minds, you just want the other gender identity than the one that aligns with
145480	146480	their biological sex.
146480	151800	I think this is why the most successful, popular and emotionally stable trans women present
151800	153600	and behave like cis women.
153600	158080	No specific examples of xenopronouns can be provided because, by their nature, it would
158080	160720	be impossible to express through human language.
160720	166160	For those that do use xenopronouns, for communication in human language they may use auxiliary or
166160	171320	alternate pronouns, or wish to be treated as null-pronomenal, oh what fresh hell is
171320	172320	this?
172320	177240	Null-pronomenal, also known as non-pronomenal, un-pronomenal, a-pronomenal, pronounless,
177240	183480	void-pronoun, or impronoun, is the act of not using third person pronouns of any kind.
183480	186440	Oh my god, they've got flags for all of this shit too.
186440	191160	You know, for being so anti-nationalist, leftoids love to divide themselves up into camps and
191160	193900	wave banners signifying their allegiance.
193900	197620	The Phrae-pronomenal flag by fandom user femboyquinn.
197620	200260	What the fuck is Phrae-pronomenal?
200260	205960	It is a form of pronoun non-conformity and may be considered a de-human pronoun depending
205960	206960	on the user.
206960	208780	What the fuck is a de-human pronoun?
208780	212620	Being non-pronomenal may overlap with name-self pronouns.
212620	214500	What the fuck is name-self pronouns?
214500	219140	I wanted to go back to the auxiliary pronouns page from the last passage, but every link
219140	222580	I click on, there's three more terms I don't understand.
222580	225340	This is worse than link-surfing on TV-tropes.
225340	229660	Denny-pronomial is a term for someone who is normally null-pronomial but occasionally
229660	230980	uses pronouns.
230980	235860	This may overlap with one being pronoun fluid, however it doesn't have to.
235860	239540	I'm going to guess that pronoun fluid is that you change your pronouns sometimes, right?
239540	244980	Pronoun fluid is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time.
244980	249100	One's pronouns may change over the course of hours, days, weeks, or months, and the
249100	252860	gender of the person does not matter and does not have to change with the pronouns.
252860	258740	Oh, okay, so you can be a girl, fully biologically female, gender is woman, not even a trans
258740	263020	man, you're a cis woman, and you can use he-him pronouns because you're pronoun non-conforming.
263020	266760	Wait a second, pronoun non-conforming is something different, it's just using pronouns in a
266760	267760	non-standard way.
267760	272140	Okay, okay, what I'm talking about is what this wiki calls cross-pronominal.
272140	273140	Fuck me, dude.
273140	277140	The cross-pronominal flag looks like a candy you might have found in a cheap paper bag
277140	278700	at the corner store back in the day.
278700	282100	It was made by Beyond Mogai Pride Flags.
282100	284180	Is this your greatest contribution, dude?
284180	287780	Making these fucking flags that will never actually fly anywhere IRL?
287780	289060	Is this how you spend your time?
289060	291820	Alright, let's jump a few stages back.
291820	294460	Cross-pronominal to pronoun non-conforming to pronoun fluid.
294460	301260	Core fluid, no, core fluid is a term for someone who is both gender fluid and pronoun fluid,
301260	304540	and whose pronouns change to correlate with their gender.
304540	310660	Pronoun fluid, also known as neofluid, is when one is pronoun fluid only between neopronouns.
310660	316980	A neofluid individual may also have exipronouns so long as they are only fluid in neopronouns.
316980	325740	Muto-pronoun, or mutopronominal, is a term used to describe when one's pronouns change
325740	327420	in certain situations or contexts.
327420	328740	Okay, this one I kind of understand.
328740	333300	It's like how drag queens out of drag use he and him, but use she-her in drag.
333300	334300	I've got it.
334300	336780	The reason, though, is because Naomi likes to watch Drag Race.
336780	342420	Emotopronounfluid, also known as emotopronominal, is a subset of pronoun fluid where one's
342420	345780	pronouns change depending on one's mood, emotions, or state of mind.
345780	350260	Oh, is this the source of the was-were joke, when your state of mind is dead?
350260	354380	Pronoun fae, or pronoun doe, is the act of switching or transitioning between two or
354380	358100	more pronoun sets over time, but only feminine pronouns.
358100	363920	Pronoun fawn, or pronoun fawn, is the act of switching or transitioning between two
363920	368000	or more pronoun sets over time, but only masculine pronouns.
368000	374160	Um, excuse me, but the very act of even considering pronoun sets masculine or feminine is inherently
374160	375160	oppressive.
375160	376160	Thank you very much.
376160	380600	Pronoun floor is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time,
380600	381920	but only neutral pronouns.
381920	384200	Oh, I guess they already have that one covered.
384200	389520	Pronoun soros is the act of switching or transitioning between two or more pronoun sets over time,
389520	391400	but only androgynous pronouns.
391400	394240	It actually sounds more like dinosaur pronouns, frankly.
394240	396240	Pronoun soros people can have any gender.
396240	402380	For example, a pronoun floor person may go by she shim one day and shy hire the next,
402380	404480	and then a week later switch back to she shim.
404480	407520	Oh my god, what is the fucking point?
407520	410760	Why does she shim have an entry but shy hire doesn't?
410760	414840	I can actually kind of intuit what she shim means as an androgynous thing, but I actually
414840	418000	want an explanation of where the fuck shy hire came from.
418000	422520	Also, look at the bottom of this page, coined on December 13th, 2021, coined on November
422520	426080	1st, 2020, January 7th, 2022, October 2021.
426080	429680	These are just people who have been locked down for too long during coronavirus and have
429680	431120	had nothing to do.
431120	434860	Fray-pronomenal is a term for people who lose their connection to a set of pronouns the
434860	438720	more the set is used to refer to them, and become more likely to change their pronouns
438720	440400	as a result of this lost connection.
440400	442940	In other words, after a set of pronouns gets old, you change them.
442940	444680	This is literally just being a special snowflake.
444680	450920	Jesus Christ, there's libra-pronomenal, hemi-pronomenal, grey-pronomenal, proxy-pronomenal, CAD-pronomenal,
450920	455320	someone who was allo-pronomenal but no longer relates to pronouns due to past trauma.
455320	456640	Is this even possible?
456640	458240	Like, how would this happen?
458240	461840	Would a rapist have to write the person's pronouns on their dick before he does it?
461840	463120	Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
463120	468400	Meyer-pronomenal, mere-pronomenal, someone who has multiple null-pronomenal labels.
468400	471000	Yeah, we covered null-pronomenal earlier, didn't we?
471000	475120	Null-pronomenal is the act of not using third-person pronouns of any kind, right, right.
475120	479600	If you're not using any pronouns, how are you fucking using multiples of them?
479600	480600	Multiples of nothing?
480600	484280	You know, after all of this, that auxiliary pronouns page I wanted to check out earlier
484280	486240	seems quaint by comparison.
486240	490760	Auxiliary pronouns, also known as alternate pronouns, are a pronoun set or sets that one
490760	495080	likes less than their primary pronoun set, but still allows others to use to refer to
495080	496080	oneself.
496080	499080	Yeah, this is just the whole she-they thing that you see on Twitter sometimes.
499160	500160	Where...
500160	502200	Emoji self-pronouns?
502200	503560	Emoji self-pronouns.
503560	506160	Emoji self-pronouns are a form of gender-neutral neo-pronouns.
506160	510800	They are similar to noun self-pronouns, but instead of using letters, they use emojis
510800	511800	or other pictograms.
511800	516180	They may be used for a number of reasons, such as liking the way the emoji looks, liking
516180	520480	the way they may sound in their head, or because one feels the emoji describes them or reflects
520480	521960	something about their gender well.
521960	526000	Emoji self-pronouns are meant to be used in text-based communication only.
526000	529920	They cannot be pronounced and are not intended to be pronounced, but some may have spoken
529920	530920	alternatives.
530920	532560	I'm trying my best not to laugh here, guys.
532560	536960	Most emoji pronoun users have pronouns to be used in spoken conversation.
536960	541800	Some emoji pronoun users will use a noun self-pronoun set based on the emoji.
541800	546800	Other emoji self-pronoun users may use pronouns like he, she, they, or other pronouns that
546800	549400	are unrelated to the emoji in spoken conversation.
549400	553480	Others may go by no pronouns in speech.
553480	559720	An example of emoji self-pronouns is, this is if the pronoun is a strawberry emoji.
559720	560720	Strawberry went to the store.
560720	561720	You're not supposed to say it.
561720	565360	You're supposed to have the picture of the strawberry emoji in your head, I guess.
565360	566360	Strawberry went to the store.
566360	567440	I met strawberry today.
567440	569560	Berry walked berry's dog today.
569560	574720	Spoken alternatives to the above set of emoji self-pronouns could be be b berry self straw
574720	577560	strawberry self fruit fruit self.
577560	580880	Yeah, I would not be surprised if you were a fucking fruit, dude.
580920	585440	The noun self-pronouns page that we skipped over, though, brings us full circle.
585440	589840	Noun self-pronouns are a type of neo pronouns that are clearly derived from a pre-existing
589840	592880	word to be used as a gender neutral pronoun set.
592880	597120	Any word can be turned into a pronoun set, so this allows there to be theoretically infinite
597120	598720	sets of noun self-pronouns.
598720	601480	The word in question does not have to be a noun.
601480	602600	Oh, all right.
602600	607620	Some of the earliest sets of noun self-pronouns are the fairy themed set fe fair and the bunny
607620	609680	themed set bun buns.
609680	613160	And of course we now have dog self, cat self, and many others.
613160	615640	Remember the deer gender people that hit the spotlight a year or so ago?
615640	616640	Nice and soft.
616640	621240	Round to the back of the head.
621240	622240	Yeah, them.
622240	626120	I think they use doe doe self-pronouns, and I'm guessing they're part of this shit.
626120	630280	The issue with fad pronouns like these isn't that they're artificially constructed and
630280	632200	socially imposed for a political benefit.
632200	634240	Well, no, that is the issue, but there's a bigger issue.
634240	637640	It's that it adds a new unnecessary dimension of complexity.
637640	640320	I can already hear the progressive reply to this herder.
640320	643460	You can remember hundreds of Pokemon, but you can't remember a couple dozen pronouns.
643460	644460	That doesn't matter.
644460	648220	Trust grows when you don't have to think about something and you can just simplify it.
648220	651560	We do this to objects and we do it to each other, and it's not bad that we do this.
651560	653040	It's in our nature as tribals.
653040	656320	We didn't need to know the intricate details of the biology of the tiger that is about
656320	657320	to eat us.
657320	661640	We simplify it to big roar teeth scary when I trade with you, I don't need to know your
661640	663480	life story and you don't need to know mine.
663480	667340	If I hire you to build my house, I don't need to know every detail of how you grew up and
667340	670080	became interested in building houses and who taught you how to do it.
670080	673340	I just need to know that you can do the job that I pay for and you just need to know that
673340	674420	I can pay you for it.
674420	678580	For some things, you may need a bit more detail, but you never need to know all of the detail.
678580	681780	I may need to see the credentials of somebody who's building a very complex house.
681780	685380	I may need to see examples of his prior work, but I will never need to hook myself up to
685380	689940	his brain and experience second by second the entire process of how he learned to do
689940	690940	it.
690940	694940	Trust may come from knowing somebody intimately, for example, in a romantic context, but trust
694940	699300	between business partners, between citizens, between friends comes from not needing to
699300	702780	know, from simplifying the other person in your eyes so that you only need to engage
702780	705500	with the public part of themselves that they put forward.
705500	708520	Everything else can remain private and unknown, and that's okay.
708520	712740	We evolved to handle complex environments by simplifying what we can trust.
712740	716580	That's why we say, I trust him, he'd never betray me, even if he actually has the capacity
716580	717580	for betrayal.
717580	720820	Because what you're doing is you're taking a leap of faith and assuming that all of those
720820	723340	possible futures where he betrays you won't happen.
723340	727880	Even if they could happen, resources spent on fallback plans can be better spent elsewhere.
727880	732220	So if your trust isn't misplaced, that's less time spent on the possibility of being betrayed
732220	734360	and more time spent on your actual goal.
734360	738840	This is why high trust societies end up more prosperous than low trust ones, regardless
738840	743400	of access to resources, because you're spending way less time on periphery plans that are
743400	745560	only relevant if you get backstabbed.
745560	750020	All of these crazy gender identities and pronouns, and moreover the strict insistence on their
750020	754860	constant use, adds unnecessary complexity, which adds chaos, which reduces trust.
754860	759040	I don't need to know the gender, or the biological sex for that matter, of the person who's serving
759040	760900	me food or scanning my groceries.
760900	765660	And including this stuff as a necessary component of the interaction, bogs down that interaction.
765660	770580	Some people take glee at the idea of breaking other people's automated cognitive processes.
770580	773840	Fair enough, subversion can be fun, being the outsider can make you feel special.
773840	778220	But those same people also complain about not being accepted, or how people treat them
778220	779700	weirdly and how it's everyone else's problem.
780380	784100	And it's like, yes, what do you think is the natural end result of breaking people's
784100	785500	automated cognitive scripts?
785500	788740	You're not being abused, you're breaking the mold, and then complaining that you no
788740	790460	longer have a mold that contains you.
790460	792180	Shut up and do your fucking dishes.
792180	794060	Here's my final take on it.
794060	795360	Men and women, fine.
795360	796900	Trans men, trans women, also okay.
796900	801260	I can completely understand adhering to regular gender norms and just wanting the other one.
801260	805100	Feeling both masculine and feminine at the same time, I can see that, sure.
805100	808900	Feeling agender, like you don't align with either man or woman, fine, okay.
808900	810620	Men, woman, both, neither.
810620	815420	I can conceive of these options existing, even if the options for biological sex are
815420	819060	literally only male, female, and various deformities.
819060	821900	But all this other nonsense is just meaningless garbage.
821900	826600	The legitimate options already map on perfectly to he, she, and they, as is.
826600	829940	Deer gender, cat gender, whatever, none of that shit is fucking real.
829940	833240	These people have debilitating, crippling mental illnesses that are preventing them
833240	835420	from being happy and joining normal society.
