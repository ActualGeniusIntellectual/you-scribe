1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
10.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,320
A lot has been said in the past few years about California's decline.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,600
For a long time, LA was considered that city you had to move to if you wanted to get serious

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,080
about your career, especially if that career was in tech or entertainment.

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,460
This means that the city is filled with some of the most successful tech startups and movie

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,920
studios in the world, as well as being home to literally the largest graveyard of dreams

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
on the planet.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
Most people who move to LA don't actually make it.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,080
They join the service economy, doing menial jobs for those who have made it, watching

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,800
their savings, their youth, and their hope dwindle away until they're forced to either

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,880
return to their hometown in shame, or even worse, get stuck in the city because they

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,560
no longer have the money to afford the cost of moving away.

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,120
If you've kept your finger on the pulse of online discourse, especially on the right

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,080
side of politics, you've probably noticed a wider narrative forming with the collapse

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,480
of California into the ocean.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,840
And because rightist politics lend well to grand narratives, stuff like the Californian

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,680
attitude on gender is narratively tied into the current crime spree running rampant right

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
now.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
I'll show you what I mean.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,360
Here's a compilation of headlines made by a right-wing creator with the implication

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,920
that everything is deeply tied together as some form of anti-God degeneracy or something.

22
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,620
Knowingly exposing others to HIV is no longer a felony in California.

23
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,440
California becomes a first state to legally recognize a third gender.

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,640
California prosecutes man for posting anti-Muslim messages on Facebook.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,280
Another university seeks to deconstruct masculinity.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,000
27% of California teens are gender nonconforming.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,080
Illegal immigration costs California most at $23 billion.

28
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,880
All states combined cost $89 billion.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,720
California teacher put on leave for asking if schools would allow walkouts to protest

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
abortion.

31
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,980
Thousands of pounds of human waste removed from Orange County homeless camp.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,460
California school bans national anthem for being racially insensitive.

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,200
California appoints illegal alien to state office.

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,120
Using wrong pronoun for transgender senior?

35
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
California may punish you.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,080
San Francisco or Mumbai, UN envoy encounters homeless life in California.

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,760
California is a national leader in outbound moves.

38
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Where did they go?

39
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,600
To a religious person, this looks like a series of data points that can be connected together

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,960
to show that California is the next Sodom and Gomorrah, that the rampant sexual deviancy

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,400
and hedonism is causing the total collapse and destruction of the state.

42
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,240
And hey, fair enough.

43
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,600
But not being religious myself, I think something a bit different is connecting these stories

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,600
together.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,040
These headlines can be placed into three broad categories.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Let's look at the first group, distractions.

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,880
Most of the gender stuff can be placed here.

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,100
California is probably the most gender inclusive location in the world.

49
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,960
And there's actually a positive side to that.

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,840
It's clearly not the government's business or anybody else's for that matter.

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,720
If you're gay or trans, and if you're privately living your gay or trans life, there's no

52
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,360
reason you should tolerate a mob of religious zealots harassing you for it.

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,640
But and this will become a recurring theme throughout this video, California doesn't

54
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,560
understand the idea of the golden mean.

55
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,040
In other words, you can actually have too much of a good thing.

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,540
For example, California banned state sponsored travel to 17 other states in the union for

57
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:03,440
those states anti LGBTQ laws.

58
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,080
What this means in a practical sense is that if the state was funding interstate travel

59
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,300
to these locations in any way, that funding is now illegal.

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,360
So if California is receiving a shipment of goods from Texas, the companies doing that

61
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,080
are no longer subsidized, the cost of shipping increases and goods on Californian shelves

62
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,480
see their prices go up.

63
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,040
Another running theme in this video will be that California does not understand economics.

64
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,000
Also, man, is it only me or do those LGBTQ registration cards seem really fucking weird?

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,060
Does the state really need to know how much you like cock?

66
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:35,840
They're learning from social media, I guess package surveillance up as convenience and

67
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,360
acceptance and people will willingly do it to themselves.

68
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,680
I could go forever on this topic, but there's literally a new article every day describing

69
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,140
California's gender based bread and circuses.

70
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,980
So let's move on to the second category mismanagement.

71
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,200
This is what the bread and circus stuff is meant to distract you from the entire state

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,060
of California is draped in a pride flag so that you don't see what's beneath it.

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,940
For example, like how Californian towns routinely go without water in heat waves due to poor

74
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,360
management of the state's public works facilities.

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,180
Of course, Californian farms are allowed by the state to bypass water restrictions because

76
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,540
food production is important.

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,700
But this has incentivized farms that create more luxury food products that take up huge

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,080
amounts of water, like almond farms, for example, to completely destroy California's

79
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
water table.

80
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,760
Meanwhile, state politicians are amazingly corrupt, with the Democrats having a total

81
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,100
strangle on the Californian political system for decades now.

82
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,300
They fuck you every which way and the population still reelects them because red team bad.

83
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,260
It doesn't matter how corrupt they are, it doesn't matter how much money they embezzle.

84
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,540
Hell, it doesn't even matter if they're a pedo, they might even lionize you then.

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:40,080
A lot of these tyrant tendencies became fully known due to COVID-19 and California's restrictions

86
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,760
are, predictably, some of the worst in the US.

87
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,140
One of the more recent battles has been over the mandatory vaccination of all state workers,

88
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,160
with police and firefighter unions vowing to fight the state orders, and the state vowing

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,200
to penalize those who don't comply.

90
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,860
What's really funny though is comparing California's coronavirus response to that HIV headline

91
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,820
from earlier, New California Law Reduces Penalty for Knowingly Exposing Someone to HIV.

92
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,360
In that article, published back in 2017, California State Senator Scott Wiener, Scott Wiener,

93
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,000
said HIV is a public health issue, not a criminal issue.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,840
That was his justification for downgrading from a felony to a misdemeanor, knowingly

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,080
infecting your partner with HIV.

96
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,760
Why aren't they taking this stance with COVID vaccines?

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,160
Are they also not a criminal but a public health issue?

98
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,380
In fact, this is an even crazier situation, because if you know you have HIV and you go

99
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:31,420
out to have sex with people, you know you're passing it on, but an unvaccinated person

100
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,360
can be walking around, not knowing if they're currently spreading COVID because of how often

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,800
the virus is asymptomatic.

102
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,240
Well, the larger picture here is just that California is fucking insane when it comes

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,320
to health management.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,820
Measles and mumps, stuff that we get vaccinated for as kids, have routine outbreaks among

105
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,360
California's homeless population.

106
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,600
Hell, even fucking leprosy and the bubonic plague are making a comeback in LA.

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,040
I don't want to hear shit about any sort of healthcare direction or advice coming out

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
of California.

109
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,120
They're literally living in the middle fucking ages when it comes to medicine.

110
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,160
The third group, reaction, is what you get when you suffer mismanagement for long enough

111
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,840
that these distractions stop working.

112
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,720
It is no secret to anybody that California is currently worse than Gotham fucking city

113
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,240
when it comes to crime.

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,660
Videos of street muggings and smash and grabs go viral constantly.

115
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,260
People are so blatant about it that they waltz into stores with trash bags, load up on whatever

116
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,020
the fuck they want, and walk out.

117
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,600
One of the reasons this is happening so often is because of Proposition 47, which raised

118
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,120
the felony threshold for theft from $400 to $950.

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,520
In other words, thefts below $950 are considered misdemeanors, which means that in practical

120
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,400
reality, good luck getting the police to investigate them, let alone even show up.

121
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,740
It's also personal thefts that have ramped up, not just commercial thefts.

122
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,920
People are seeing their houses and cars broken into regularly, with Seth Rogen even coming

123
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,460
down from his perch to comment on how it's just part and parcel of living in LA.

124
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,900
In order to avoid window damage, drivers in LA are now moving towards just leaving their

125
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,360
cars open with nothing inside of them so that robbers will hopefully leave them alone.

126
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,440
The police are predictably no help, telling citizens to just lay back and present their

127
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,360
asshole if a robber decides to break into their house, rather than, you know, defending

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,400
their home and family.

129
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,340
As the situation in LA continues to deteriorate, we've actually seen the return of fucking

130
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,760
train robberies.

131
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,040
Straight up, we're gonna need to bring back trains guarded by coachmen or something.

132
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,600
A journalist local to LA went down to investigate and had this to say,

133
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,740
I keep hearing of train burglaries in LA on the scanner, so went to Lincoln Heights to

134
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
see it all.

135
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,520
There's looted packages as far as the eye can see, Amazon packages, UPS boxes, unused

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,960
COVID tests, fishing lures, EpiPens, cargo containers left busted open on trains.

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,440
I'm told by law enforcement these UPS bags are especially sought after by thieves opening

138
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,440
cargo containers.

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,600
They are often full of boxes with merchandise bound for residential addresses.

140
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,640
More valuable than, say, a cargo container full of low-value bulky items like toilet

141
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
paper.

142
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,480
This opened package is destined for Bainbridge Island, Washington state.

143
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,320
Typing in the UPS tracking number and it obviously lists it as delayed.

144
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,200
We found lots of opened packages bound for the Northwest along this section of tracks.

145
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,840
As you can see, trains frequently slow or stop in this area as they get worked into

146
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,040
the Union Pacific Intermodal Facility near downtown LA.

147
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,680
The thieves use this opportunity to break open containers and take what's inside.

148
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,880
I'd say every fourth or fifth rail car had open containers.

149
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Missing a package?

150
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Shipment delayed?

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,480
Maybe your package is among the thousands we found discarded along the tracks.

152
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,920
This is but one area thieves have targeted trains.

153
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,480
You were told this area was just cleaned up 30 days ago, so what you see is all within

154
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,520
the last month.

155
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,540
Beyond this one reporter's pretty extensive coverage, there's also viral videos of the

156
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,740
train heists in action, where mobs of people drive up to parked trains and begin picking

157
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,000
through their contents.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,160
These don't look like starving, desperate people.

159
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,800
In fact, most of the things they're stealing appear to be TVs.

160
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Also, I'm not sure if running alongside a fucking moving train is the brightest idea.

161
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,420
One misstep and you're dead.

162
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:51,280
The amount of debris left on the ground after all of these robberies has gotten to the point

163
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,260
that trains are actually having trouble chugging down the tracks, making the situation even

164
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,340
more unsafe.

165
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:01,960
This series of events finally culminated with a train derailment recently inside the LA

166
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,220
trainyard facility.

167
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,000
But it's not just the theft.

168
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,960
California is also failing to enforce other laws.

169
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,180
Good luck, San Francisco.

170
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,720
Your new DA has explicitly stated crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,320
sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.

172
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
Now I get it.

173
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,000
The situation is shitty, but you should be allowed to do it behind closed doors.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you know what?

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,520
Everyone's had that time where you had to take a leak and there's no bathroom around.

176
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,220
But there's a reason that San Francisco based phone app Snapcrap went viral.

177
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,960
Because there's so much poop sitting around the city that you can't even fucking walk

178
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,840
anywhere without seeing it or smelling it.

179
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
I mean, look at this shit.

180
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
No joke.

181
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,220
Look at the amount of shit.

182
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,140
Drug addiction is also on the rise.

183
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,060
Videos are coming out of California looking like a fucking zombie movie with burnout stumbling

184
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,620
around the streets, operating only on instinct, with no higher signs of life or intelligence.

185
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,020
Progressive ideas about harm reduction are, in fact, enabling the state of affairs.

186
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,900
The Prague's talk at length about how the state needs to provide clean needles and how

187
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,980
there need to be safe, clean sources of heroin and meth.

188
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,460
As if there could be such a thing.

189
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,220
It's fucking heroin and meth.

190
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,300
Yeah, lacing it with fentanyl is awful, but taking fentanyl out of heroin still means

191
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,100
it's fucking heroin and giving druggies needles is enabling their addiction.

192
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:15,620
The ultimate problem with the Prague harm reduction position is look at how much fucking

193
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,620
heroin enables.

194
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,020
At some point, you have to stop worrying about reducing the bad and start worrying about

195
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
building the good.

196
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,760
If you spend all of your time putting out fires and none of your time actually being

197
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,020
constructive and building some sort of positive virtue, you've already royally fucked up.

198
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,860
Californian views on violent crime beyond the mugging are also astronomically stupid.

199
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:40,100
San Francisco is now paying people $300 a month not to shoot each other because violent

200
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,380
crime is just that fucking high in the city and the law is just that unenforced.

201
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,160
Stories and videos of homeless drug addicts randomly attacking people indiscriminately

202
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,220
routinely go viral, ranging from stabbings and shootings to, most novely, using an improvised

203
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,460
flame thrower on a city train.

204
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,860
Meanwhile, California's response to this state of affairs is to suddenly release 76,000

205
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,540
prisoners, 63,000 of which have been convicted for violent crimes, 20,000 of which are serving

206
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,060
life sentences, in an attempt to create a safer, more just, and more equitable prison

207
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
system.

208
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,220
All of this nonsense is the source of the California Exodus.

209
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,500
The idea that people are abandoning California because it is an absolutely terrible place

210
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
to live.

211
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,700
The Wikipedia page on the phenomenon still maintains that the Exodus narrative is not

212
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,860
yet proven, but I think everybody can see the writing on the wall.

213
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,140
Big tech is slowly moving out of Silicon Valley.

214
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,600
Elon Musk recently famously relocated Tesla to Texas.

215
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,740
For the first time in a very long time, more average people are leaving California than

216
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,680
moving to it, a lot of them also moving to Texas cities like Houston and Dallas.

217
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,800
They're even willing to pay California's move-out-of-state tax just to get the fuck

218
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
away.

219
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:50,460
And yes, California is behaving like a weird clingy ex here, requiring you to pay them

220
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,000
in order to have the privilege of moving away.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,320
Despite decades of a total democratic stranglehold over the Californian political system, these

222
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,400
new arrivals to these places are voting the same way and agitating for the same corruption,

223
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,840
dysfunction and distraction that they're fleeing from.

224
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,280
Progs are too stupid to realize that their ideas are the cause of all of this shit.

225
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,940
This is a point that I made in my hawks and doves video.

226
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,040
It bears repeating.

227
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
The leftoid position on home invasions and riots and looting is that lives are always

228
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,040
more important than things.

229
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,880
And sure, I can see that point of view.

230
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,740
It intuitively feels right, it tugs at the heartstrings.

231
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,040
If you have to smash a window to pull a person to safety, you don't worry about the value

232
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,160
of the window, the person's life is more important.

233
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,920
The leftoid, and to be frank even some libertarians would say, you shouldn't ever use violence

234
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,780
except to stop violence, you shouldn't risk a life except to save more lives.

235
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,640
And that sounds good on the surface, so that's where the leftoid stops thinking because they're

236
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
feeling righteous and reaffirmed.

237
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,720
But the problem is, if a police officer sees a burglar robbing a house, the officer should

238
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,540
try to stop the burglar, even if the burglar might fight back and somebody might get killed.

239
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,120
Even if the burglar's only stealing things and not taking lives.

240
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,080
Because if nobody even so much as inconveniences burglars, that creates a permissibility towards

241
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
burglary.

242
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,520
It creates an incentive to be a burglar.

243
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,280
If bad people are willing to risk violence to get what they want, and good people always

244
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,040
back down because violence is too terrible to risk, then society falls apart because

245
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,620
nobody is willing to defend anything.

246
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,240
The issue, fundamentally, is that progressives believe they occupy the space of God.

247
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,720
You don't even have to believe in God to see how this is the case.

248
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,440
From the objective, all knowing, all seeing position of God, you can look down at the

249
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,320
earth and see all the people and all the things and say very clearly, yes, of course,

250
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,520
people are more important than things.

251
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,200
You can get more things, you can make more things, you can't replace people, they're

252
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
special.

253
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,680
But none of us inhabit God's position.

254
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,080
We know our friends and family, we know our homes and businesses, we know what is particular

255
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,080
to us and we don't know what isn't.

256
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,440
We cannot make moral judgments as if we are God because we don't exist in His position

257
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,900
and we don't enjoy the relative power and safety of that position.

258
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,860
We are not above the people, we are a member of the people.

259
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,780
And from our position here, not everybody can be given the same consideration.

260
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,380
This is why the common response to the soy boy who says, lives are more important than

261
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,600
things, is to hear back, his right to life is guaranteed by me if he doesn't try to take

262
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
my things.

263
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,500
He clearly values my things more than his life to try to take them, so why shouldn't

264
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,520
I value them in the same way?

265
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,140
This is the normal position.

266
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,700
Even nowadays, with how increasingly leftward the culture is pushing, this is still how

267
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,840
most people think.

268
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,100
The stuff I work to own, let alone the lives of my family, are way more important than

269
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,460
the life of the home invader.

270
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,460
From the position of God, there's no real responsibility.

271
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,560
You can see everybody's life, everybody's web of connections and motivations.

272
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,600
You can see that the home invader lacked a father figure and his mother beat them and

273
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,220
he was homeless at 16 and he's never really had a real opportunity to have a real life.

274
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,220
Fair enough.

275
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,620
This is why the justice system often, and in many cases should, take those factors into

276
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,240
account during sentencing.

277
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,120
But you're not the justice system.

278
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
You're not God.

279
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,180
You're the person with your partner and your kids asleep in the other room.

280
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:49,700
You're the person who worked years to build that business that is about to be hit by a

281
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,980
molotov cocktail.

282
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,240
And your position, as subjective as it is, contains additional information provided to

283
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,140
you by that subjectivity, by that context, that the position above everything does not

284
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,540
have access to.

285
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,980
Which is why we recognize ideas like personal responsibility and those who would put themselves

286
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,940
in the position of God don't.

287
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,180
Taking that sky high position and saying, well it's all relative, everybody's got circumstances,

288
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,420
it's all material condition, says the communist, is a fast track to disarming yourself in the

289
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,420
face of a threat.

290
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,020
The rioter and the robber are playing their role.

291
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,740
If you want to oppose them, you must play yours.
