00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
10.

00:05.640 --> 00:09.320
A lot has been said in the past few years about California's decline.

00:09.320 --> 00:13.600
For a long time, LA was considered that city you had to move to if you wanted to get serious

00:13.600 --> 00:17.080
about your career, especially if that career was in tech or entertainment.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.460
This means that the city is filled with some of the most successful tech startups and movie

00:20.460 --> 00:24.920
studios in the world, as well as being home to literally the largest graveyard of dreams

00:24.920 --> 00:25.920
on the planet.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.240
Most people who move to LA don't actually make it.

00:28.240 --> 00:32.080
They join the service economy, doing menial jobs for those who have made it, watching

00:32.080 --> 00:35.800
their savings, their youth, and their hope dwindle away until they're forced to either

00:35.800 --> 00:39.880
return to their hometown in shame, or even worse, get stuck in the city because they

00:39.880 --> 00:42.560
no longer have the money to afford the cost of moving away.

00:42.560 --> 00:46.120
If you've kept your finger on the pulse of online discourse, especially on the right

00:46.120 --> 00:50.080
side of politics, you've probably noticed a wider narrative forming with the collapse

00:50.080 --> 00:51.480
of California into the ocean.

00:51.480 --> 00:55.840
And because rightist politics lend well to grand narratives, stuff like the Californian

00:55.840 --> 01:00.680
attitude on gender is narratively tied into the current crime spree running rampant right

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
now.

01:01.680 --> 01:02.680
I'll show you what I mean.

01:02.680 --> 01:06.360
Here's a compilation of headlines made by a right-wing creator with the implication

01:06.360 --> 01:11.920
that everything is deeply tied together as some form of anti-God degeneracy or something.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.620
Knowingly exposing others to HIV is no longer a felony in California.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.440
California becomes a first state to legally recognize a third gender.

01:20.440 --> 01:24.640
California prosecutes man for posting anti-Muslim messages on Facebook.

01:24.640 --> 01:27.280
Another university seeks to deconstruct masculinity.

01:27.280 --> 01:31.000
27% of California teens are gender nonconforming.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.080
Illegal immigration costs California most at $23 billion.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.880
All states combined cost $89 billion.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.720
California teacher put on leave for asking if schools would allow walkouts to protest

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
abortion.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.980
Thousands of pounds of human waste removed from Orange County homeless camp.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.460
California school bans national anthem for being racially insensitive.

01:51.460 --> 01:54.200
California appoints illegal alien to state office.

01:54.200 --> 01:57.120
Using wrong pronoun for transgender senior?

01:57.120 --> 01:58.120
California may punish you.

01:58.120 --> 02:03.080
San Francisco or Mumbai, UN envoy encounters homeless life in California.

02:03.080 --> 02:05.760
California is a national leader in outbound moves.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
Where did they go?

02:06.760 --> 02:10.600
To a religious person, this looks like a series of data points that can be connected together

02:10.600 --> 02:14.960
to show that California is the next Sodom and Gomorrah, that the rampant sexual deviancy

02:14.960 --> 02:18.400
and hedonism is causing the total collapse and destruction of the state.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.240
And hey, fair enough.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.600
But not being religious myself, I think something a bit different is connecting these stories

02:24.600 --> 02:25.600
together.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.040
These headlines can be placed into three broad categories.

02:28.040 --> 02:31.040
Let's look at the first group, distractions.

02:31.040 --> 02:32.880
Most of the gender stuff can be placed here.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.100
California is probably the most gender inclusive location in the world.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.960
And there's actually a positive side to that.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.840
It's clearly not the government's business or anybody else's for that matter.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.720
If you're gay or trans, and if you're privately living your gay or trans life, there's no

02:44.720 --> 02:48.360
reason you should tolerate a mob of religious zealots harassing you for it.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.640
But and this will become a recurring theme throughout this video, California doesn't

02:51.640 --> 02:53.560
understand the idea of the golden mean.

02:53.560 --> 02:56.040
In other words, you can actually have too much of a good thing.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.540
For example, California banned state sponsored travel to 17 other states in the union for

03:00.540 --> 03:03.440
those states anti LGBTQ laws.

03:03.440 --> 03:07.080
What this means in a practical sense is that if the state was funding interstate travel

03:07.080 --> 03:10.300
to these locations in any way, that funding is now illegal.

03:10.300 --> 03:14.360
So if California is receiving a shipment of goods from Texas, the companies doing that

03:14.360 --> 03:19.080
are no longer subsidized, the cost of shipping increases and goods on Californian shelves

03:19.080 --> 03:20.480
see their prices go up.

03:20.480 --> 03:24.040
Another running theme in this video will be that California does not understand economics.

03:24.040 --> 03:30.000
Also, man, is it only me or do those LGBTQ registration cards seem really fucking weird?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.060
Does the state really need to know how much you like cock?

03:32.060 --> 03:35.840
They're learning from social media, I guess package surveillance up as convenience and

03:35.840 --> 03:38.360
acceptance and people will willingly do it to themselves.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.680
I could go forever on this topic, but there's literally a new article every day describing

03:41.680 --> 03:44.140
California's gender based bread and circuses.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.980
So let's move on to the second category mismanagement.

03:46.980 --> 03:51.200
This is what the bread and circus stuff is meant to distract you from the entire state

03:51.200 --> 03:55.060
of California is draped in a pride flag so that you don't see what's beneath it.

03:55.060 --> 03:59.940
For example, like how Californian towns routinely go without water in heat waves due to poor

03:59.940 --> 04:02.360
management of the state's public works facilities.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.180
Of course, Californian farms are allowed by the state to bypass water restrictions because

04:06.180 --> 04:07.540
food production is important.

04:07.540 --> 04:11.700
But this has incentivized farms that create more luxury food products that take up huge

04:11.700 --> 04:16.080
amounts of water, like almond farms, for example, to completely destroy California's

04:16.080 --> 04:17.080
water table.

04:17.080 --> 04:20.760
Meanwhile, state politicians are amazingly corrupt, with the Democrats having a total

04:20.760 --> 04:24.100
strangle on the Californian political system for decades now.

04:24.100 --> 04:28.300
They fuck you every which way and the population still reelects them because red team bad.

04:28.300 --> 04:31.260
It doesn't matter how corrupt they are, it doesn't matter how much money they embezzle.

04:31.260 --> 04:34.540
Hell, it doesn't even matter if they're a pedo, they might even lionize you then.

04:34.540 --> 04:40.080
A lot of these tyrant tendencies became fully known due to COVID-19 and California's restrictions

04:40.080 --> 04:42.760
are, predictably, some of the worst in the US.

04:42.760 --> 04:47.140
One of the more recent battles has been over the mandatory vaccination of all state workers,

04:47.140 --> 04:51.160
with police and firefighter unions vowing to fight the state orders, and the state vowing

04:51.160 --> 04:53.200
to penalize those who don't comply.

04:53.200 --> 04:57.860
What's really funny though is comparing California's coronavirus response to that HIV headline

04:57.860 --> 05:02.820
from earlier, New California Law Reduces Penalty for Knowingly Exposing Someone to HIV.

05:02.820 --> 05:08.360
In that article, published back in 2017, California State Senator Scott Wiener, Scott Wiener,

05:08.360 --> 05:12.000
said HIV is a public health issue, not a criminal issue.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.840
That was his justification for downgrading from a felony to a misdemeanor, knowingly

05:15.840 --> 05:18.080
infecting your partner with HIV.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.760
Why aren't they taking this stance with COVID vaccines?

05:20.760 --> 05:23.160
Are they also not a criminal but a public health issue?

05:23.160 --> 05:27.380
In fact, this is an even crazier situation, because if you know you have HIV and you go

05:27.380 --> 05:31.420
out to have sex with people, you know you're passing it on, but an unvaccinated person

05:31.420 --> 05:35.360
can be walking around, not knowing if they're currently spreading COVID because of how often

05:35.360 --> 05:36.800
the virus is asymptomatic.

05:36.840 --> 05:41.240
Well, the larger picture here is just that California is fucking insane when it comes

05:41.240 --> 05:42.320
to health management.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.820
Measles and mumps, stuff that we get vaccinated for as kids, have routine outbreaks among

05:46.820 --> 05:48.360
California's homeless population.

05:48.360 --> 05:52.600
Hell, even fucking leprosy and the bubonic plague are making a comeback in LA.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.040
I don't want to hear shit about any sort of healthcare direction or advice coming out

05:56.040 --> 05:57.040
of California.

05:57.040 --> 06:00.120
They're literally living in the middle fucking ages when it comes to medicine.

06:00.120 --> 06:04.160
The third group, reaction, is what you get when you suffer mismanagement for long enough

06:04.160 --> 06:05.840
that these distractions stop working.

06:05.880 --> 06:10.720
It is no secret to anybody that California is currently worse than Gotham fucking city

06:10.720 --> 06:12.240
when it comes to crime.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.660
Videos of street muggings and smash and grabs go viral constantly.

06:15.660 --> 06:19.260
People are so blatant about it that they waltz into stores with trash bags, load up on whatever

06:19.260 --> 06:21.020
the fuck they want, and walk out.

06:21.020 --> 06:24.600
One of the reasons this is happening so often is because of Proposition 47, which raised

06:24.600 --> 06:28.120
the felony threshold for theft from $400 to $950.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.520
In other words, thefts below $950 are considered misdemeanors, which means that in practical

06:32.520 --> 06:36.400
reality, good luck getting the police to investigate them, let alone even show up.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.740
It's also personal thefts that have ramped up, not just commercial thefts.

06:39.740 --> 06:43.920
People are seeing their houses and cars broken into regularly, with Seth Rogen even coming

06:43.920 --> 06:47.460
down from his perch to comment on how it's just part and parcel of living in LA.

06:47.460 --> 06:51.900
In order to avoid window damage, drivers in LA are now moving towards just leaving their

06:51.900 --> 06:56.360
cars open with nothing inside of them so that robbers will hopefully leave them alone.

06:56.360 --> 07:00.440
The police are predictably no help, telling citizens to just lay back and present their

07:00.440 --> 07:04.360
asshole if a robber decides to break into their house, rather than, you know, defending

07:04.360 --> 07:05.400
their home and family.

07:05.400 --> 07:09.340
As the situation in LA continues to deteriorate, we've actually seen the return of fucking

07:09.340 --> 07:10.760
train robberies.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.040
Straight up, we're gonna need to bring back trains guarded by coachmen or something.

07:14.040 --> 07:17.600
A journalist local to LA went down to investigate and had this to say,

07:17.600 --> 07:21.740
I keep hearing of train burglaries in LA on the scanner, so went to Lincoln Heights to

07:21.740 --> 07:22.740
see it all.

07:22.740 --> 07:27.520
There's looted packages as far as the eye can see, Amazon packages, UPS boxes, unused

07:27.520 --> 07:31.960
COVID tests, fishing lures, EpiPens, cargo containers left busted open on trains.

07:31.960 --> 07:36.440
I'm told by law enforcement these UPS bags are especially sought after by thieves opening

07:36.440 --> 07:37.440
cargo containers.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.600
They are often full of boxes with merchandise bound for residential addresses.

07:41.600 --> 07:45.640
More valuable than, say, a cargo container full of low-value bulky items like toilet

07:45.640 --> 07:46.640
paper.

07:46.640 --> 07:50.480
This opened package is destined for Bainbridge Island, Washington state.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.320
Typing in the UPS tracking number and it obviously lists it as delayed.

07:54.320 --> 07:59.200
We found lots of opened packages bound for the Northwest along this section of tracks.

07:59.200 --> 08:03.840
As you can see, trains frequently slow or stop in this area as they get worked into

08:03.840 --> 08:07.040
the Union Pacific Intermodal Facility near downtown LA.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.680
The thieves use this opportunity to break open containers and take what's inside.

08:10.680 --> 08:14.880
I'd say every fourth or fifth rail car had open containers.

08:14.880 --> 08:15.880
Missing a package?

08:15.880 --> 08:16.880
Shipment delayed?

08:16.880 --> 08:19.480
Maybe your package is among the thousands we found discarded along the tracks.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.920
This is but one area thieves have targeted trains.

08:21.920 --> 08:25.480
You were told this area was just cleaned up 30 days ago, so what you see is all within

08:25.480 --> 08:26.520
the last month.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.540
Beyond this one reporter's pretty extensive coverage, there's also viral videos of the

08:30.540 --> 08:34.740
train heists in action, where mobs of people drive up to parked trains and begin picking

08:34.740 --> 08:36.000
through their contents.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.160
These don't look like starving, desperate people.

08:38.160 --> 08:40.800
In fact, most of the things they're stealing appear to be TVs.

08:40.800 --> 08:45.800
Also, I'm not sure if running alongside a fucking moving train is the brightest idea.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.420
One misstep and you're dead.

08:47.420 --> 08:51.280
The amount of debris left on the ground after all of these robberies has gotten to the point

08:51.280 --> 08:55.260
that trains are actually having trouble chugging down the tracks, making the situation even

08:55.260 --> 08:56.340
more unsafe.

08:56.340 --> 09:01.960
This series of events finally culminated with a train derailment recently inside the LA

09:01.960 --> 09:03.220
trainyard facility.

09:03.220 --> 09:05.000
But it's not just the theft.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.960
California is also failing to enforce other laws.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.180
Good luck, San Francisco.

09:09.180 --> 09:13.720
Your new DA has explicitly stated crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting

09:13.720 --> 09:18.320
sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.320
Now I get it.

09:19.320 --> 09:22.000
The situation is shitty, but you should be allowed to do it behind closed doors.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
And you know what?

09:23.000 --> 09:25.520
Everyone's had that time where you had to take a leak and there's no bathroom around.

09:25.520 --> 09:30.220
But there's a reason that San Francisco based phone app Snapcrap went viral.

09:30.220 --> 09:33.960
Because there's so much poop sitting around the city that you can't even fucking walk

09:33.960 --> 09:35.840
anywhere without seeing it or smelling it.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.040
I mean, look at this shit.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.040
No joke.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.220
Look at the amount of shit.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.140
Drug addiction is also on the rise.

09:41.140 --> 09:45.060
Videos are coming out of California looking like a fucking zombie movie with burnout stumbling

09:45.060 --> 09:49.620
around the streets, operating only on instinct, with no higher signs of life or intelligence.

09:49.620 --> 09:54.020
Progressive ideas about harm reduction are, in fact, enabling the state of affairs.

09:54.020 --> 09:57.900
The Prague's talk at length about how the state needs to provide clean needles and how

09:57.900 --> 10:00.980
there need to be safe, clean sources of heroin and meth.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.460
As if there could be such a thing.

10:02.460 --> 10:04.220
It's fucking heroin and meth.

10:04.220 --> 10:08.300
Yeah, lacing it with fentanyl is awful, but taking fentanyl out of heroin still means

10:08.300 --> 10:12.100
it's fucking heroin and giving druggies needles is enabling their addiction.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.620
The ultimate problem with the Prague harm reduction position is look at how much fucking

10:15.620 --> 10:16.620
heroin enables.

10:16.620 --> 10:20.020
At some point, you have to stop worrying about reducing the bad and start worrying about

10:20.020 --> 10:21.060
building the good.

10:21.060 --> 10:24.760
If you spend all of your time putting out fires and none of your time actually being

10:24.760 --> 10:30.020
constructive and building some sort of positive virtue, you've already royally fucked up.

10:30.020 --> 10:34.860
Californian views on violent crime beyond the mugging are also astronomically stupid.

10:34.860 --> 10:40.100
San Francisco is now paying people $300 a month not to shoot each other because violent

10:40.100 --> 10:44.380
crime is just that fucking high in the city and the law is just that unenforced.

10:44.380 --> 10:48.160
Stories and videos of homeless drug addicts randomly attacking people indiscriminately

10:48.160 --> 10:53.220
routinely go viral, ranging from stabbings and shootings to, most novely, using an improvised

10:53.220 --> 10:55.460
flame thrower on a city train.

10:55.460 --> 10:59.860
Meanwhile, California's response to this state of affairs is to suddenly release 76,000

10:59.860 --> 11:05.540
prisoners, 63,000 of which have been convicted for violent crimes, 20,000 of which are serving

11:05.540 --> 11:10.060
life sentences, in an attempt to create a safer, more just, and more equitable prison

11:10.060 --> 11:11.060
system.

11:11.060 --> 11:14.220
All of this nonsense is the source of the California Exodus.

11:14.220 --> 11:18.500
The idea that people are abandoning California because it is an absolutely terrible place

11:18.500 --> 11:19.500
to live.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.700
The Wikipedia page on the phenomenon still maintains that the Exodus narrative is not

11:22.700 --> 11:25.860
yet proven, but I think everybody can see the writing on the wall.

11:25.860 --> 11:28.140
Big tech is slowly moving out of Silicon Valley.

11:28.140 --> 11:31.600
Elon Musk recently famously relocated Tesla to Texas.

11:31.600 --> 11:35.740
For the first time in a very long time, more average people are leaving California than

11:35.740 --> 11:39.680
moving to it, a lot of them also moving to Texas cities like Houston and Dallas.

11:39.680 --> 11:44.800
They're even willing to pay California's move-out-of-state tax just to get the fuck

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
away.

11:45.800 --> 11:50.460
And yes, California is behaving like a weird clingy ex here, requiring you to pay them

11:50.460 --> 11:53.000
in order to have the privilege of moving away.

11:53.000 --> 11:57.320
Despite decades of a total democratic stranglehold over the Californian political system, these

11:57.320 --> 12:02.400
new arrivals to these places are voting the same way and agitating for the same corruption,

12:02.400 --> 12:04.840
dysfunction and distraction that they're fleeing from.

12:04.840 --> 12:09.280
Progs are too stupid to realize that their ideas are the cause of all of this shit.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.940
This is a point that I made in my hawks and doves video.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.040
It bears repeating.

12:13.040 --> 12:17.360
The leftoid position on home invasions and riots and looting is that lives are always

12:17.360 --> 12:19.040
more important than things.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.880
And sure, I can see that point of view.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.740
It intuitively feels right, it tugs at the heartstrings.

12:23.740 --> 12:27.040
If you have to smash a window to pull a person to safety, you don't worry about the value

12:27.080 --> 12:29.160
of the window, the person's life is more important.

12:29.160 --> 12:33.920
The leftoid, and to be frank even some libertarians would say, you shouldn't ever use violence

12:33.920 --> 12:37.780
except to stop violence, you shouldn't risk a life except to save more lives.

12:37.780 --> 12:41.640
And that sounds good on the surface, so that's where the leftoid stops thinking because they're

12:41.640 --> 12:42.840
feeling righteous and reaffirmed.

12:42.840 --> 12:47.720
But the problem is, if a police officer sees a burglar robbing a house, the officer should

12:47.720 --> 12:52.540
try to stop the burglar, even if the burglar might fight back and somebody might get killed.

12:52.540 --> 12:56.120
Even if the burglar's only stealing things and not taking lives.

12:56.120 --> 13:01.080
Because if nobody even so much as inconveniences burglars, that creates a permissibility towards

13:01.080 --> 13:02.080
burglary.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.520
It creates an incentive to be a burglar.

13:03.520 --> 13:07.280
If bad people are willing to risk violence to get what they want, and good people always

13:07.280 --> 13:11.040
back down because violence is too terrible to risk, then society falls apart because

13:11.040 --> 13:12.620
nobody is willing to defend anything.

13:12.620 --> 13:16.240
The issue, fundamentally, is that progressives believe they occupy the space of God.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.720
You don't even have to believe in God to see how this is the case.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.440
From the objective, all knowing, all seeing position of God, you can look down at the

13:22.440 --> 13:26.320
earth and see all the people and all the things and say very clearly, yes, of course,

13:26.320 --> 13:27.520
people are more important than things.

13:27.520 --> 13:31.200
You can get more things, you can make more things, you can't replace people, they're

13:31.200 --> 13:32.200
special.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.680
But none of us inhabit God's position.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.080
We know our friends and family, we know our homes and businesses, we know what is particular

13:38.080 --> 13:40.080
to us and we don't know what isn't.

13:40.080 --> 13:44.440
We cannot make moral judgments as if we are God because we don't exist in His position

13:44.440 --> 13:47.900
and we don't enjoy the relative power and safety of that position.

13:47.900 --> 13:50.860
We are not above the people, we are a member of the people.

13:50.860 --> 13:54.780
And from our position here, not everybody can be given the same consideration.

13:54.780 --> 13:58.380
This is why the common response to the soy boy who says, lives are more important than

13:58.380 --> 14:02.600
things, is to hear back, his right to life is guaranteed by me if he doesn't try to take

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
my things.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.500
He clearly values my things more than his life to try to take them, so why shouldn't

14:07.500 --> 14:09.520
I value them in the same way?

14:09.520 --> 14:11.140
This is the normal position.

14:11.140 --> 14:14.700
Even nowadays, with how increasingly leftward the culture is pushing, this is still how

14:14.700 --> 14:15.840
most people think.

14:15.840 --> 14:20.100
The stuff I work to own, let alone the lives of my family, are way more important than

14:20.100 --> 14:21.460
the life of the home invader.

14:21.460 --> 14:24.460
From the position of God, there's no real responsibility.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.560
You can see everybody's life, everybody's web of connections and motivations.

14:27.560 --> 14:30.600
You can see that the home invader lacked a father figure and his mother beat them and

14:30.600 --> 14:34.220
he was homeless at 16 and he's never really had a real opportunity to have a real life.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.220
Fair enough.

14:35.220 --> 14:38.620
This is why the justice system often, and in many cases should, take those factors into

14:38.620 --> 14:40.240
account during sentencing.

14:40.240 --> 14:42.120
But you're not the justice system.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
You're not God.

14:43.120 --> 14:46.180
You're the person with your partner and your kids asleep in the other room.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.700
You're the person who worked years to build that business that is about to be hit by a

14:49.700 --> 14:50.980
molotov cocktail.

14:50.980 --> 14:56.240
And your position, as subjective as it is, contains additional information provided to

14:56.240 --> 15:01.140
you by that subjectivity, by that context, that the position above everything does not

15:01.140 --> 15:02.540
have access to.

15:02.540 --> 15:06.980
Which is why we recognize ideas like personal responsibility and those who would put themselves

15:06.980 --> 15:08.940
in the position of God don't.

15:08.940 --> 15:13.180
Taking that sky high position and saying, well it's all relative, everybody's got circumstances,

15:13.180 --> 15:17.420
it's all material condition, says the communist, is a fast track to disarming yourself in the

15:17.420 --> 15:18.420
face of a threat.

15:18.420 --> 15:21.020
The rioter and the robber are playing their role.

15:21.020 --> 15:23.740
If you want to oppose them, you must play yours.
