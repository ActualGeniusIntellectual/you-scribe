0	5640	10.
5640	9320	A lot has been said in the past few years about California's decline.
9320	13600	For a long time, LA was considered that city you had to move to if you wanted to get serious
13600	17080	about your career, especially if that career was in tech or entertainment.
17080	20460	This means that the city is filled with some of the most successful tech startups and movie
20460	24920	studios in the world, as well as being home to literally the largest graveyard of dreams
24920	25920	on the planet.
25920	28240	Most people who move to LA don't actually make it.
28240	32080	They join the service economy, doing menial jobs for those who have made it, watching
32080	35800	their savings, their youth, and their hope dwindle away until they're forced to either
35800	39880	return to their hometown in shame, or even worse, get stuck in the city because they
39880	42560	no longer have the money to afford the cost of moving away.
42560	46120	If you've kept your finger on the pulse of online discourse, especially on the right
46120	50080	side of politics, you've probably noticed a wider narrative forming with the collapse
50080	51480	of California into the ocean.
51480	55840	And because rightist politics lend well to grand narratives, stuff like the Californian
55840	60680	attitude on gender is narratively tied into the current crime spree running rampant right
60680	61680	now.
61680	62680	I'll show you what I mean.
62680	66360	Here's a compilation of headlines made by a right-wing creator with the implication
66360	71920	that everything is deeply tied together as some form of anti-God degeneracy or something.
71920	76620	Knowingly exposing others to HIV is no longer a felony in California.
76620	80440	California becomes a first state to legally recognize a third gender.
80440	84640	California prosecutes man for posting anti-Muslim messages on Facebook.
84640	87280	Another university seeks to deconstruct masculinity.
87280	91000	27% of California teens are gender nonconforming.
91000	95080	Illegal immigration costs California most at $23 billion.
95080	97880	All states combined cost $89 billion.
97880	101720	California teacher put on leave for asking if schools would allow walkouts to protest
101720	102720	abortion.
102720	106980	Thousands of pounds of human waste removed from Orange County homeless camp.
106980	111460	California school bans national anthem for being racially insensitive.
111460	114200	California appoints illegal alien to state office.
114200	117120	Using wrong pronoun for transgender senior?
117120	118120	California may punish you.
118120	123080	San Francisco or Mumbai, UN envoy encounters homeless life in California.
123080	125760	California is a national leader in outbound moves.
125760	126760	Where did they go?
126760	130600	To a religious person, this looks like a series of data points that can be connected together
130600	134960	to show that California is the next Sodom and Gomorrah, that the rampant sexual deviancy
134960	138400	and hedonism is causing the total collapse and destruction of the state.
138400	140240	And hey, fair enough.
140240	144600	But not being religious myself, I think something a bit different is connecting these stories
144600	145600	together.
145600	148040	These headlines can be placed into three broad categories.
148040	151040	Let's look at the first group, distractions.
151040	152880	Most of the gender stuff can be placed here.
152880	156100	California is probably the most gender inclusive location in the world.
156100	157960	And there's actually a positive side to that.
157960	160840	It's clearly not the government's business or anybody else's for that matter.
160840	164720	If you're gay or trans, and if you're privately living your gay or trans life, there's no
164720	168360	reason you should tolerate a mob of religious zealots harassing you for it.
168360	171640	But and this will become a recurring theme throughout this video, California doesn't
171640	173560	understand the idea of the golden mean.
173560	176040	In other words, you can actually have too much of a good thing.
176040	180540	For example, California banned state sponsored travel to 17 other states in the union for
180540	183440	those states anti LGBTQ laws.
183440	187080	What this means in a practical sense is that if the state was funding interstate travel
187080	190300	to these locations in any way, that funding is now illegal.
190300	194360	So if California is receiving a shipment of goods from Texas, the companies doing that
194360	199080	are no longer subsidized, the cost of shipping increases and goods on Californian shelves
199080	200480	see their prices go up.
200480	204040	Another running theme in this video will be that California does not understand economics.
204040	210000	Also, man, is it only me or do those LGBTQ registration cards seem really fucking weird?
210000	212060	Does the state really need to know how much you like cock?
212060	215840	They're learning from social media, I guess package surveillance up as convenience and
215840	218360	acceptance and people will willingly do it to themselves.
218360	221680	I could go forever on this topic, but there's literally a new article every day describing
221680	224140	California's gender based bread and circuses.
224140	226980	So let's move on to the second category mismanagement.
226980	231200	This is what the bread and circus stuff is meant to distract you from the entire state
231200	235060	of California is draped in a pride flag so that you don't see what's beneath it.
235060	239940	For example, like how Californian towns routinely go without water in heat waves due to poor
239940	242360	management of the state's public works facilities.
242360	246180	Of course, Californian farms are allowed by the state to bypass water restrictions because
246180	247540	food production is important.
247540	251700	But this has incentivized farms that create more luxury food products that take up huge
251700	256080	amounts of water, like almond farms, for example, to completely destroy California's
256080	257080	water table.
257080	260760	Meanwhile, state politicians are amazingly corrupt, with the Democrats having a total
260760	264100	strangle on the Californian political system for decades now.
264100	268300	They fuck you every which way and the population still reelects them because red team bad.
268300	271260	It doesn't matter how corrupt they are, it doesn't matter how much money they embezzle.
271260	274540	Hell, it doesn't even matter if they're a pedo, they might even lionize you then.
274540	280080	A lot of these tyrant tendencies became fully known due to COVID-19 and California's restrictions
280080	282760	are, predictably, some of the worst in the US.
282760	287140	One of the more recent battles has been over the mandatory vaccination of all state workers,
287140	291160	with police and firefighter unions vowing to fight the state orders, and the state vowing
291160	293200	to penalize those who don't comply.
293200	297860	What's really funny though is comparing California's coronavirus response to that HIV headline
297860	302820	from earlier, New California Law Reduces Penalty for Knowingly Exposing Someone to HIV.
302820	308360	In that article, published back in 2017, California State Senator Scott Wiener, Scott Wiener,
308360	312000	said HIV is a public health issue, not a criminal issue.
312000	315840	That was his justification for downgrading from a felony to a misdemeanor, knowingly
315840	318080	infecting your partner with HIV.
318080	320760	Why aren't they taking this stance with COVID vaccines?
320760	323160	Are they also not a criminal but a public health issue?
323160	327380	In fact, this is an even crazier situation, because if you know you have HIV and you go
327380	331420	out to have sex with people, you know you're passing it on, but an unvaccinated person
331420	335360	can be walking around, not knowing if they're currently spreading COVID because of how often
335360	336800	the virus is asymptomatic.
336840	341240	Well, the larger picture here is just that California is fucking insane when it comes
341240	342320	to health management.
342320	346820	Measles and mumps, stuff that we get vaccinated for as kids, have routine outbreaks among
346820	348360	California's homeless population.
348360	352600	Hell, even fucking leprosy and the bubonic plague are making a comeback in LA.
352600	356040	I don't want to hear shit about any sort of healthcare direction or advice coming out
356040	357040	of California.
357040	360120	They're literally living in the middle fucking ages when it comes to medicine.
360120	364160	The third group, reaction, is what you get when you suffer mismanagement for long enough
364160	365840	that these distractions stop working.
365880	370720	It is no secret to anybody that California is currently worse than Gotham fucking city
370720	372240	when it comes to crime.
372240	375660	Videos of street muggings and smash and grabs go viral constantly.
375660	379260	People are so blatant about it that they waltz into stores with trash bags, load up on whatever
379260	381020	the fuck they want, and walk out.
381020	384600	One of the reasons this is happening so often is because of Proposition 47, which raised
384600	388120	the felony threshold for theft from $400 to $950.
388120	392520	In other words, thefts below $950 are considered misdemeanors, which means that in practical
392520	396400	reality, good luck getting the police to investigate them, let alone even show up.
396400	399740	It's also personal thefts that have ramped up, not just commercial thefts.
399740	403920	People are seeing their houses and cars broken into regularly, with Seth Rogen even coming
403920	407460	down from his perch to comment on how it's just part and parcel of living in LA.
407460	411900	In order to avoid window damage, drivers in LA are now moving towards just leaving their
411900	416360	cars open with nothing inside of them so that robbers will hopefully leave them alone.
416360	420440	The police are predictably no help, telling citizens to just lay back and present their
420440	424360	asshole if a robber decides to break into their house, rather than, you know, defending
424360	425400	their home and family.
425400	429340	As the situation in LA continues to deteriorate, we've actually seen the return of fucking
429340	430760	train robberies.
430760	434040	Straight up, we're gonna need to bring back trains guarded by coachmen or something.
434040	437600	A journalist local to LA went down to investigate and had this to say,
437600	441740	I keep hearing of train burglaries in LA on the scanner, so went to Lincoln Heights to
441740	442740	see it all.
442740	447520	There's looted packages as far as the eye can see, Amazon packages, UPS boxes, unused
447520	451960	COVID tests, fishing lures, EpiPens, cargo containers left busted open on trains.
451960	456440	I'm told by law enforcement these UPS bags are especially sought after by thieves opening
456440	457440	cargo containers.
457440	461600	They are often full of boxes with merchandise bound for residential addresses.
461600	465640	More valuable than, say, a cargo container full of low-value bulky items like toilet
465640	466640	paper.
466640	470480	This opened package is destined for Bainbridge Island, Washington state.
470480	474320	Typing in the UPS tracking number and it obviously lists it as delayed.
474320	479200	We found lots of opened packages bound for the Northwest along this section of tracks.
479200	483840	As you can see, trains frequently slow or stop in this area as they get worked into
483840	487040	the Union Pacific Intermodal Facility near downtown LA.
487040	490680	The thieves use this opportunity to break open containers and take what's inside.
490680	494880	I'd say every fourth or fifth rail car had open containers.
494880	495880	Missing a package?
495880	496880	Shipment delayed?
496880	499480	Maybe your package is among the thousands we found discarded along the tracks.
499480	501920	This is but one area thieves have targeted trains.
501920	505480	You were told this area was just cleaned up 30 days ago, so what you see is all within
505480	506520	the last month.
506520	510540	Beyond this one reporter's pretty extensive coverage, there's also viral videos of the
510540	514740	train heists in action, where mobs of people drive up to parked trains and begin picking
514740	516000	through their contents.
516000	518160	These don't look like starving, desperate people.
518160	520800	In fact, most of the things they're stealing appear to be TVs.
520800	525800	Also, I'm not sure if running alongside a fucking moving train is the brightest idea.
525800	527420	One misstep and you're dead.
527420	531280	The amount of debris left on the ground after all of these robberies has gotten to the point
531280	535260	that trains are actually having trouble chugging down the tracks, making the situation even
535260	536340	more unsafe.
536340	541960	This series of events finally culminated with a train derailment recently inside the LA
541960	543220	trainyard facility.
543220	545000	But it's not just the theft.
545000	547960	California is also failing to enforce other laws.
547960	549180	Good luck, San Francisco.
549180	553720	Your new DA has explicitly stated crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting
553720	558320	sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc. should not and will not be prosecuted.
558320	559320	Now I get it.
559320	562000	The situation is shitty, but you should be allowed to do it behind closed doors.
562000	563000	And you know what?
563000	565520	Everyone's had that time where you had to take a leak and there's no bathroom around.
565520	570220	But there's a reason that San Francisco based phone app Snapcrap went viral.
570220	573960	Because there's so much poop sitting around the city that you can't even fucking walk
573960	575840	anywhere without seeing it or smelling it.
575840	577040	I mean, look at this shit.
577040	578040	No joke.
578040	579220	Look at the amount of shit.
579220	581140	Drug addiction is also on the rise.
581140	585060	Videos are coming out of California looking like a fucking zombie movie with burnout stumbling
585060	589620	around the streets, operating only on instinct, with no higher signs of life or intelligence.
589620	594020	Progressive ideas about harm reduction are, in fact, enabling the state of affairs.
594020	597900	The Prague's talk at length about how the state needs to provide clean needles and how
597900	600980	there need to be safe, clean sources of heroin and meth.
600980	602460	As if there could be such a thing.
602460	604220	It's fucking heroin and meth.
604220	608300	Yeah, lacing it with fentanyl is awful, but taking fentanyl out of heroin still means
608300	612100	it's fucking heroin and giving druggies needles is enabling their addiction.
612140	615620	The ultimate problem with the Prague harm reduction position is look at how much fucking
615620	616620	heroin enables.
616620	620020	At some point, you have to stop worrying about reducing the bad and start worrying about
620020	621060	building the good.
621060	624760	If you spend all of your time putting out fires and none of your time actually being
624760	630020	constructive and building some sort of positive virtue, you've already royally fucked up.
630020	634860	Californian views on violent crime beyond the mugging are also astronomically stupid.
634860	640100	San Francisco is now paying people $300 a month not to shoot each other because violent
640100	644380	crime is just that fucking high in the city and the law is just that unenforced.
644380	648160	Stories and videos of homeless drug addicts randomly attacking people indiscriminately
648160	653220	routinely go viral, ranging from stabbings and shootings to, most novely, using an improvised
653220	655460	flame thrower on a city train.
655460	659860	Meanwhile, California's response to this state of affairs is to suddenly release 76,000
659860	665540	prisoners, 63,000 of which have been convicted for violent crimes, 20,000 of which are serving
665540	670060	life sentences, in an attempt to create a safer, more just, and more equitable prison
670060	671060	system.
671060	674220	All of this nonsense is the source of the California Exodus.
674220	678500	The idea that people are abandoning California because it is an absolutely terrible place
678500	679500	to live.
679500	682700	The Wikipedia page on the phenomenon still maintains that the Exodus narrative is not
682700	685860	yet proven, but I think everybody can see the writing on the wall.
685860	688140	Big tech is slowly moving out of Silicon Valley.
688140	691600	Elon Musk recently famously relocated Tesla to Texas.
691600	695740	For the first time in a very long time, more average people are leaving California than
695740	699680	moving to it, a lot of them also moving to Texas cities like Houston and Dallas.
699680	704800	They're even willing to pay California's move-out-of-state tax just to get the fuck
704800	705800	away.
705800	710460	And yes, California is behaving like a weird clingy ex here, requiring you to pay them
710460	713000	in order to have the privilege of moving away.
713000	717320	Despite decades of a total democratic stranglehold over the Californian political system, these
717320	722400	new arrivals to these places are voting the same way and agitating for the same corruption,
722400	724840	dysfunction and distraction that they're fleeing from.
724840	729280	Progs are too stupid to realize that their ideas are the cause of all of this shit.
729280	731940	This is a point that I made in my hawks and doves video.
731940	733040	It bears repeating.
733040	737360	The leftoid position on home invasions and riots and looting is that lives are always
737360	739040	more important than things.
739040	740880	And sure, I can see that point of view.
740880	743740	It intuitively feels right, it tugs at the heartstrings.
743740	747040	If you have to smash a window to pull a person to safety, you don't worry about the value
747080	749160	of the window, the person's life is more important.
749160	753920	The leftoid, and to be frank even some libertarians would say, you shouldn't ever use violence
753920	757780	except to stop violence, you shouldn't risk a life except to save more lives.
757780	761640	And that sounds good on the surface, so that's where the leftoid stops thinking because they're
761640	762840	feeling righteous and reaffirmed.
762840	767720	But the problem is, if a police officer sees a burglar robbing a house, the officer should
767720	772540	try to stop the burglar, even if the burglar might fight back and somebody might get killed.
772540	776120	Even if the burglar's only stealing things and not taking lives.
776120	781080	Because if nobody even so much as inconveniences burglars, that creates a permissibility towards
781080	782080	burglary.
782080	783520	It creates an incentive to be a burglar.
783520	787280	If bad people are willing to risk violence to get what they want, and good people always
787280	791040	back down because violence is too terrible to risk, then society falls apart because
791040	792620	nobody is willing to defend anything.
792620	796240	The issue, fundamentally, is that progressives believe they occupy the space of God.
796240	798720	You don't even have to believe in God to see how this is the case.
798720	802440	From the objective, all knowing, all seeing position of God, you can look down at the
802440	806320	earth and see all the people and all the things and say very clearly, yes, of course,
806320	807520	people are more important than things.
807520	811200	You can get more things, you can make more things, you can't replace people, they're
811200	812200	special.
812200	813680	But none of us inhabit God's position.
813680	818080	We know our friends and family, we know our homes and businesses, we know what is particular
818080	820080	to us and we don't know what isn't.
820080	824440	We cannot make moral judgments as if we are God because we don't exist in His position
824440	827900	and we don't enjoy the relative power and safety of that position.
827900	830860	We are not above the people, we are a member of the people.
830860	834780	And from our position here, not everybody can be given the same consideration.
834780	838380	This is why the common response to the soy boy who says, lives are more important than
838380	842600	things, is to hear back, his right to life is guaranteed by me if he doesn't try to take
842600	843600	my things.
843600	847500	He clearly values my things more than his life to try to take them, so why shouldn't
847500	849520	I value them in the same way?
849520	851140	This is the normal position.
851140	854700	Even nowadays, with how increasingly leftward the culture is pushing, this is still how
854700	855840	most people think.
855840	860100	The stuff I work to own, let alone the lives of my family, are way more important than
860100	861460	the life of the home invader.
861460	864460	From the position of God, there's no real responsibility.
864460	867560	You can see everybody's life, everybody's web of connections and motivations.
867560	870600	You can see that the home invader lacked a father figure and his mother beat them and
870600	874220	he was homeless at 16 and he's never really had a real opportunity to have a real life.
874220	875220	Fair enough.
875220	878620	This is why the justice system often, and in many cases should, take those factors into
878620	880240	account during sentencing.
880240	882120	But you're not the justice system.
882120	883120	You're not God.
883120	886180	You're the person with your partner and your kids asleep in the other room.
886180	889700	You're the person who worked years to build that business that is about to be hit by a
889700	890980	molotov cocktail.
890980	896240	And your position, as subjective as it is, contains additional information provided to
896240	901140	you by that subjectivity, by that context, that the position above everything does not
901140	902540	have access to.
902540	906980	Which is why we recognize ideas like personal responsibility and those who would put themselves
906980	908940	in the position of God don't.
908940	913180	Taking that sky high position and saying, well it's all relative, everybody's got circumstances,
913180	917420	it's all material condition, says the communist, is a fast track to disarming yourself in the
917420	918420	face of a threat.
918420	921020	The rioter and the robber are playing their role.
921020	923740	If you want to oppose them, you must play yours.
