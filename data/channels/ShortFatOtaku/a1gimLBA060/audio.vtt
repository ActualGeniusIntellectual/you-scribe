00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Cibs is taking off as a full-time streamer and is now developing a video game.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
Taking off?

00:10.480 --> 00:12.480
That's what you're talking about.

00:12.480 --> 00:13.480
Flying away.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.480
He's like, no, come back!

00:14.480 --> 00:15.480
No, come back!

00:15.480 --> 00:17.760
Alright, Cibs, I have to sabotage you.

00:17.760 --> 00:22.760
See, I didn't think if I could do the full stream full-time and make it full streaming,

00:22.760 --> 00:26.800
but it turns out I can, and apparently grow.

00:26.800 --> 00:30.520
I don't know why I didn't do the zoom.

00:30.520 --> 00:37.160
The only thing holding me back at this point is my inability to work steadily.

00:37.160 --> 00:39.680
Is your inability to develop a worth-gethic?

00:39.680 --> 00:40.880
That's correct, though.

00:40.880 --> 00:46.560
Because, uh, well, like, if I put out videos every day for a few weeks, my channel, like,

00:46.560 --> 00:50.360
the algorithm revs up and my channel just goes wild, I can put out anything I want.

00:50.360 --> 00:54.960
Right now, I'm suffering from fucking allergies.

00:54.960 --> 00:55.960
You know what?

00:56.120 --> 00:58.960
When I was growing up, I never had allergies.

00:58.960 --> 00:59.960
Ever.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.960
Right?

01:00.960 --> 01:03.480
Spring, fall, didn't matter.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.360
But now that I'm in my 30s, holy shit, I feel like I'm shutting down for weeks at a time.

01:08.360 --> 01:14.960
My head is just swollen up, and I can't breathe, and I can't think, and I'm just like, ughhh.

01:14.960 --> 01:20.080
Over the last 30 days, Dev has published 16 videos.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.600
That's your issue.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.880
You only publish videos half the day.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.880
You need to do more work, Dev.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.360
Yes, I know.

01:27.360 --> 01:31.240
But when my head is like this, I can't write anything, I can barely think.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.440
Who cares about writing things, Dev?

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
Spring!

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
No!

01:35.440 --> 01:39.560
No, I have to- Listen, if I just put out shit, no one's gonna like it.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.760
I gotta actually think about the videos that I do.

01:41.760 --> 01:49.360
The past three days has just been me, like, holding my head, trying to get a thought together

01:49.360 --> 01:56.320
in it, completely fucking failing, you know, popping Benadryl, trying to, like, fucking

01:56.320 --> 01:57.320
get awake.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.440
Jesus, I hate fucking allergies.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.440
I hate them.

02:00.440 --> 02:04.440
If Tofflebest could have behaved like you, he would have died of cancer.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.440
Wait.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.240
He did, which means sorry, Dev.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.960
I guess I'm on my way out.

02:10.960 --> 02:14.020
Don't make the joke about it either, you'll get it.

02:14.020 --> 02:17.680
That's how it happens, when you joke about it.

02:17.680 --> 02:18.680
It's very tragic.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.640
I would never think about joking about it.

02:23.640 --> 02:29.200
I'm just hoping that I'll be fit for thinking and writing again.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.520
Come tomorrow, because I feel like I'm coming to the end of it.

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
Christ.

02:32.520 --> 02:33.800
You're still sick?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.840
Not sick, I have allergies right now.

02:35.840 --> 02:36.840
Okay.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.560
The fall is happening.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.560
All the leaves are coming down.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.560
Wrong culture.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.200
Being sick and then going on a trip and then having allergies, I've missed out on, like,

02:45.200 --> 02:47.120
two weeks worth of news cycles.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
Fuck.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.160
Better.

02:49.160 --> 02:50.160
Loser.

02:50.160 --> 02:51.160
Goddamnit.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.160
Fuck you.

02:52.160 --> 02:55.160
Sounds like a skill issue.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.160
A skill issue?

02:56.160 --> 03:01.280
Speaking of low fucking standards, Dev, I'm shitting on Google Stadia.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.280
Fucking hell, Dev.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.280
Jesus Christ, Dev.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.280
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

03:04.280 --> 03:05.440
You're talking about low hanging fucking fruit.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.440
Jesus Christ.

03:06.440 --> 03:07.960
Hey, listen, that was a decent video that I made.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.120
Jesus Christ, Dev.

03:09.120 --> 03:18.040
I saved up links since 2019 to compile a little mini history of the stadia from, like, announcement

03:18.040 --> 03:24.360
to launch to ending, and I put it all into a nice little 12-minute package, you know?

03:24.360 --> 03:25.760
That was a decent little video.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.760
I stand by it.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.800
It could have been a two-minute video, Dev.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.880
Um, Google Stadia sucks.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.080
It was always gonna suck.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.680
Well, yeah, of course.

03:34.680 --> 03:35.680
Goodbye.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.920
But I wanted to have details.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.000
I wanted to have deep lore.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.040
This is why you failed, Dev.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.140
Why?

03:44.140 --> 03:47.360
This is why your last video was three days ago, not one day ago.

03:47.680 --> 03:51.240
No, my last video three days ago, because I've been lying in head with it.

03:51.240 --> 03:54.200
I've been lying in my bed with an inflated head.

03:54.200 --> 04:00.400
I want to point out that this series that I do here with you guys, my friends, this

04:00.400 --> 04:04.320
is easily the least watched thing on my channel.

04:04.320 --> 04:12.560
It's probably tanking my channel in the algorithm, but I don't care, because I have fun doing it.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.600
We're still gonna watch some garbage show after this one's done.

04:15.600 --> 04:19.440
This kind of series, what this does is this is for your core audience, because your core

04:19.440 --> 04:22.080
audience that are there for you will watch this.

04:22.080 --> 04:23.080
Yeah.

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
Yeah.

04:24.080 --> 04:27.160
It strengthens your core audience, so it's worth doing and investing.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.760
And I promise you, I need a strengthened core, that's for sure.

04:30.760 --> 04:31.760
Enough nonsense.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.220
We're gonna get to it.

04:33.220 --> 04:34.220
Let's go.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.220
Press the button.

04:35.220 --> 04:36.220
Before...

04:36.220 --> 04:38.560
No, not yet, Kibs.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.560
Impatient Kibs.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.960
As always, there's a few things to discuss real quick.

04:43.960 --> 04:47.520
So we probably should have talked about this last week, but it kind of flew over my head.

04:47.520 --> 04:52.440
Did you all see this where the Amazon analyst said that he fell asleep watching Rings of

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440
Power?

04:53.440 --> 04:54.440
No.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.440
No.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.440
I have not.

04:56.440 --> 04:57.440
Didn't pay him enough.

04:57.440 --> 04:58.440
Yeah.

04:58.440 --> 05:04.160
So he basically, there's a guy who is hired to like watch the show and he fell asleep

05:04.160 --> 05:05.160
during it.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.160
It's like, oh, well.

05:06.160 --> 05:10.200
And yeah, Amazon is actually quite worried about the show, about how much of a bust that

05:10.200 --> 05:11.200
it is.

05:11.200 --> 05:15.960
To the point that they're finally slicing those disgusting Twitch streamers' salaries.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
Fuck those people.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.960
Hey, I'm one of those people.

05:19.960 --> 05:20.960
Yeah, me too.

05:20.960 --> 05:21.960
How dare you?

05:21.960 --> 05:22.960
How dare you?

05:22.960 --> 05:23.960
Like I'm saying.

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
How fucking dare you?

05:24.960 --> 05:25.960
Where's my paycheck?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.960
Yeah, Kibs, you stream on Twitch too!

05:28.960 --> 05:32.960
Oh, yeah, I do get a paycheck from him.

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
Yay.

05:33.960 --> 05:34.960
Not anymore, you don't.

05:34.960 --> 05:39.600
Speaking of streamers though, Arch, do you guys remember the Rings of Power superfans?

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
Yes.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.560
Think back, think back, we're talking like six months ago, Amazon hired three influencers,

05:47.560 --> 05:48.560
specifically influencers.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.600
The fellowship of influencers.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.820
To come in and talk about how good the Rings of Power looked like it was going to be after

05:54.820 --> 05:57.000
that first trailer dropped.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.480
With absolutely no gun pointed behind your heads.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.040
Wasn't a gun, it was a giant fat paycheck.

06:03.040 --> 06:06.640
Every time I was like, okay, take a breath, something new would happen and it was, huh,

06:06.640 --> 06:07.640
huh, huh.

06:07.640 --> 06:08.640
It's middle earth, it's never peace, right?

06:08.880 --> 06:09.880
Like Sauron is hot.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.560
I feel like people will be like, I can fix him.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.040
Middle earth had like a club.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.680
Yo, this tune is banking.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.080
Awestruck, mystified and scatstruck.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.080
Wow.

06:19.080 --> 06:24.080
So I decided to look them up because they're, you know, they, they are influencers on YouTube

06:24.080 --> 06:27.400
and like, I think one of them has a couple hundred thousand subs or something like, I

06:27.400 --> 06:30.240
think maybe one of them was like primarily a TikToker, I don't know.

06:30.240 --> 06:34.420
These three influencers who were paid so much to come on and promote the Lord of the Rings,

06:34.420 --> 06:35.840
the Rings of Power.

06:35.840 --> 06:40.280
Since that promotion all those months ago and throughout the entire run of the show,

06:40.280 --> 06:42.920
they have not said a single fucking thing about it.

06:42.920 --> 06:43.920
Isn't that funny?

06:43.920 --> 06:45.920
Because they were never interested.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.720
You know what makes me mad about this is, there are actually dedicated Lord of the Rings

06:49.720 --> 06:53.640
YouTubers out there that talk about the lore, that talk about the games.

06:53.640 --> 06:58.040
They're actually a Lord of the Rings YouTubing community or content creator community.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.520
Why did they reach out to them?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.120
Why didn't they reach out?

07:02.120 --> 07:03.120
Okay, Kyle.

07:03.400 --> 07:06.000
I know you're very, very retarded.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
You idiot.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Let me lay this out for you.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
Quit being literal.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
You know what I mean?

07:10.000 --> 07:13.720
I already know what I mean, but I'm pointing it out.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.360
It's because they wanted out of it.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.400
Like, that's the same reason why they haven't talked about it.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.480
This was a fucking ad.

07:19.480 --> 07:23.180
It came out yesterday that Rings of Power has been slipping massively in the ratings.

07:23.180 --> 07:25.880
So has House of the Dragon, but not nearly as much.

07:25.880 --> 07:31.840
And that, funnily enough, Cobra Kai has overtaken both of them.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.480
Like Cobra Kai was actually not bad.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.440
Like, granted, it's cliched as fuck.

07:37.440 --> 07:40.920
It is a stupid, stupid goddamn show.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.920
And I hate so much about it.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
Yeah, exactly.

07:43.920 --> 07:44.920
That's the thing.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.920
It's supposed to be.

07:45.920 --> 07:50.000
Like, it fully embraces the fact that it's supposed to be a very retarded show.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.180
It's just funny to see that this is basically how Rings of Power has been tumbling over

07:57.180 --> 07:59.560
the course of these past eight weeks.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.960
The thing is, that is the great failure of the Rings of Power.

08:02.960 --> 08:07.520
This is how you know that it is an absolute failure.

08:07.520 --> 08:12.000
The Rings of Power has managed to achieve what George R. R. Martin always wanted.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.620
To be better than Tolkien.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.440
And he's finally done it.

08:16.440 --> 08:19.960
He has a show that's better than a Lord of the Rings show.

08:19.960 --> 08:25.240
Not only the normies, but even the people who are themselves ideologically captured.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.520
They're turning on this.

08:26.520 --> 08:30.360
So on Polygon, the Rings of Power is holding Galadriel back.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.600
Amazon's show hasn't earned the elf warrior's emotional journey.

08:34.600 --> 08:39.680
So like, even, even, you know, Polygon's a shit website run by shit people.

08:39.680 --> 08:42.720
But even they are seeing that, yeah, this is actually really bad.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.720
This is actually a really bad show.

08:44.720 --> 08:46.480
And you see another one like this.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.480
It's time to admit that Rings of Power is just fan fiction.

08:49.480 --> 08:56.480
Everyone, even people who are, let's say, politically aligned to see this show succeed.

08:56.520 --> 08:59.360
Even they are saying, no, it's a failure.

08:59.360 --> 09:00.680
Well, two reasons.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.600
One, their position is by now thoroughly indefensible.

09:03.600 --> 09:07.600
Like episode seven is one of the worst pieces of television ever fucking created from virtually

09:07.600 --> 09:09.640
every single standpoint.

09:09.640 --> 09:13.080
And so it is simply far more profitable to attack it.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.120
Besides, it's almost over and Amazon payscheque isn't coming.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.580
There's no reason not to.

09:17.580 --> 09:24.120
And two, to the Rings of Power's credit, limited but maybe, it has not been particularly woke.

09:24.120 --> 09:28.120
It hasn't been banging the drum in the actual story.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.880
It did so in casting, sure as hell.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.740
But in the end, in the actual story, it's, well, it hasn't been political.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.120
It's just been shit.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.120
Yep.

09:38.120 --> 09:42.560
Oh, I guess one last thing before we start, since I don't know if, I don't know if you

09:42.560 --> 09:46.040
mentioned it during the recording or before I turned it on or whatever.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.600
My head's not exactly in there, right?

09:48.600 --> 09:52.000
It's I'm currently floating away on on medication.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.520
But Taft isn't here with us.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.960
She she's she's not feeling well.

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
R.I.P.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.960
Hopefully, she'll be back for the next show.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.200
But this is the finale.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.200
She's dead.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.200
She's dead.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.200
OK.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.200
Not joking.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.200
This is it, Kibbs.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.040
The final time you get to press play, unless you want to watch season two of this thing.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.040
You insist.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.040
It's two years away.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.040
Look, it's Amazon.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.040
Oh, my God.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.040
Wow.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.040
It's a little smiley face.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.680
I hit the recap button.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.520
Look, it's poppies.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.960
We're in Afghanistan.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.960
It's raining, actually.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.400
It rains in Afghanistan.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.400
No, it doesn't.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.400
Never.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.400
It does.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.400
So what do you do, Kibbs?

10:36.400 --> 10:37.400
It doesn't.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.300
That was a neat establishing job.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.120
That's probably the best part of this whole episode, I bet.

10:43.120 --> 10:44.840
Came humping a rock for two seconds.

10:44.840 --> 10:45.840
Yeah, basically.

10:45.840 --> 10:46.840
Listen, the bar's low.

10:46.840 --> 10:51.120
You know, I always feel bad for actors like this.

10:51.120 --> 10:55.080
You know, they're given a soaked piece of cloth and just be like, go huddle in the rain

10:55.080 --> 10:56.080
for five minutes.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.560
Like, oh, I don't feel that bad considering how much they're paid.

10:59.560 --> 11:05.720
And five minutes is like five hours because, you know, they have to get all the shots.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.720
Like 50 takes.

11:06.720 --> 11:07.720
Yeah.

11:07.720 --> 11:08.720
No, wait.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.720
It's just an apple.

11:11.720 --> 11:18.680
That's a remarkably neat look.

11:18.680 --> 11:19.680
You cut out there, Kibbs.

11:19.680 --> 11:20.680
What'd you say?

11:20.680 --> 11:22.640
I said, how the fuck did the apple get over there?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.280
It's like 30 feet away.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.280
It rolled, man.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.280
It rolled down the hill.

11:26.280 --> 11:30.120
You ever like, you're at your desk and you drop something and then you look down and

11:30.120 --> 11:34.080
it's like across the room and out into the hallway and you're like, fuck.

11:34.080 --> 11:35.080
Yeah, what happens?

11:35.080 --> 11:37.520
Oh, look, it's an apparition.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.520
See?

11:38.520 --> 11:39.520
I called it.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.160
It was an apparition.

11:41.160 --> 11:42.160
It's evil.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.160
Kill it.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.080
It's actually that short haired, white haired girl.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
Yep.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
Yeah.

11:48.080 --> 11:57.480
A real slim shady ha-doom-doom-doom.

11:57.480 --> 12:02.840
Would you like an apple?

12:02.840 --> 12:07.160
Nobody bad has ever offered an apple.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.080
I really hate the armor of that chick in particular.

12:10.080 --> 12:20.480
So, somebody owes me a blowjob, Dev.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.480
Down.

12:21.480 --> 12:22.480
No.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.480
Hold on.

12:23.480 --> 12:24.480
Down, Dev.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.480
Come now.

12:25.480 --> 12:31.360
Wait, wait, wait.

12:31.360 --> 12:32.520
I was the one who-

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
Down, Dev.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
No, no.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.560
I was the one who bet Mauler that this would be-

12:36.560 --> 12:39.520
Yeah, but you were doubting.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.160
I was never doubting.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.400
I was always strong in my faith.

12:43.400 --> 12:44.400
I don't know.

12:44.400 --> 12:50.280
You were on the Gandalf train a little bit, weren't you?

12:50.280 --> 12:51.280
God no.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.320
I didn't think it was Gandalf, but I thought I could have sworn this motherfucker would-

12:55.320 --> 12:57.320
like that would be too obvious.

12:57.320 --> 13:01.480
Well, Kyle, you two are going to have to get down on your fucking knees.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.480
No, no.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.040
Well, the most interesting plot has been revealed.

13:05.040 --> 13:06.040
I don't want to watch anymore.

13:06.040 --> 13:07.040
Oh, no.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.040
Yes, quit.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.160
No, no, no.

13:11.160 --> 13:16.600
Like I said at the beginning, this is why the hobbits are remarkably resistant to the

13:16.600 --> 13:17.680
rings of power.

13:17.680 --> 13:23.240
That's so stupid, though, because Sauron is like, I feel bad for that one fucking little

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
like hobbit thing I did-

13:24.240 --> 13:25.240
Wait a second.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.240
Wait, Arch-

13:26.240 --> 13:27.240
But the Harfoot's not even hobbits.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.600
Arch, didn't I say that back then?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.600
No.

13:30.600 --> 13:32.600
Are you taking all my good takes for yourself?

13:32.600 --> 13:33.600
Son of a slut.

13:33.600 --> 13:34.600
You're stealing my takes.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.600
Yep, Dev agreed.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
Horse shit, Dev Rudy.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
Hold on.

13:38.160 --> 13:41.160
Lilith, Lilith, you got to break the tie here.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.160
Come on, Lilith.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.160
We already broke the tie.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.160
Dev's right.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.160
I'm pretty sure you said something along the lines, Dev.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.160
Yeah, he said something after I said it.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.360
He parroted me, like the little pig that he is.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.360
I think Arch is a parroter.

13:55.360 --> 13:59.800
Wait, can't the elves just mine it themselves?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.240
You guys know how to mine, right?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.240
The land belongs to the dorists.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.240
No.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.880
How could we possibly match the powers that rule?

14:06.880 --> 14:07.880
Oh, simple.

14:07.880 --> 14:08.880
We just make rings.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.880
Oh, then my guy's going to make the rings of power with this?

14:10.880 --> 14:11.880
Are you serious?

14:11.880 --> 14:12.880
Yes.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.880
Wait, were the rings of power made out of mithril?

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
No.

14:15.880 --> 14:16.880
No.

14:16.880 --> 14:17.880
Oh.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.880
They were cracked with magic.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.680
Don't explain to us how the rings are made.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.680
Don't explain to us how the rings are made.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
I can't explain.

14:23.680 --> 14:25.680
It's in the fucking title you much much.

14:25.680 --> 14:26.680
Ah.

14:26.680 --> 14:27.680
Okay, so-

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
Ah.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.800
Okay, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.000
How Bran seems fucked.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.920
How far did she just ride?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.160
A few hundred miles at least.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.080
They just galloped all the way to elf capital.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.080
Was it Lindon?

14:44.080 --> 14:45.080
Six days.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.120
They have to get there by ship?

14:47.120 --> 14:51.560
He survived a week on a horseback.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.760
There's no way they traveled that far in six days.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.160
Oh, fuck me gently.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.760
Listen, he's just a gigachad, all right?

14:57.760 --> 15:01.840
I'm pretty sure that's over 600 miles, or 300 at the very least.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.400
They just fell that way just for bed in a hospital bed.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
Yep.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.280
Let me open up a map of Middle-earth on the second page.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.840
Couldn't they have just moved the healers over there?

15:11.840 --> 15:12.840
They just fast-traveled.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
They just fast-traveled.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.000
There are no enemies nearby.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.560
Oh, God, she's right.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.560
Of course she is.

15:19.560 --> 15:20.560
She was always right, Dev.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.560
No.

15:21.560 --> 15:22.560
Whatever the fuck that is.

15:22.560 --> 15:23.560
Dev.

15:23.560 --> 15:24.560
Dev.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.560
Okay, Lindon, 200.

15:25.560 --> 15:26.560
400.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.560
600.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.560
Dude, that's like-

15:29.280 --> 15:32.440
That's like almost 1,000 miles, if I'm doing that correctly.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.840
That's a fast horse.

15:34.840 --> 15:38.400
There's no way.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.400
No way.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.400
Yeah, I know.

15:42.400 --> 15:47.560
We watched you swim for, like, a whole fucking episode, and it was retarded.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.560
It was really bad.

15:49.560 --> 15:51.280
You know what upsets me?

15:51.280 --> 15:54.520
That style of makeup that makes their pores look enormous.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.560
It just kind of makes me feel like I'm developing tryctophobia.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.560
Sweet.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.560
Their faces look very holey now.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.560
Yeah, don't they?

16:04.560 --> 16:08.560
Like it's that lighting, that makeup style, and they just look like they're bumpy.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.560
Well, they are ascended beings, Kibbs.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.560
Make it cold so their pores close.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.560
But you don't get it, do you?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.560
I don't care about getting it.

16:17.560 --> 16:18.560
I don't want their pores to close.

16:18.560 --> 16:23.560
I remember when in movies where Galadriel just looked completely flawless and, like, shiny

16:23.560 --> 16:25.560
because that's what elves are supposed to be.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.560
That's just photoshopped.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.560
I mean, that's the point, though.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.560
Unrealistic beauty standards.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.560
All of Galadriel's OnlyFans pics are photoshopped.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.560
What is this place?

16:36.560 --> 16:38.560
This is my forge.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.560
What's the workshop of Celebrimbor?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
The Thor arches are curved.

16:42.560 --> 16:43.560
Come on, now.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.560
Now, okay.

16:44.560 --> 16:46.560
Hammer home how right I was.

16:46.560 --> 16:51.560
Let's add in a time differential as well.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.560
Let's make Halbrand Sauron, too.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.560
Oh, God.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.560
Because now he's in the forge.

16:58.560 --> 17:05.560
Now he's like, oh, but maybe I could make a ring that could, like, yes, maybe.

17:05.560 --> 17:10.560
The master I apprenticed to used to speak of the wonders of your craft.

17:10.560 --> 17:11.560
See?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.560
He's a smith, too.

17:13.560 --> 17:14.560
Oh.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
Oh, my God.

17:15.560 --> 17:17.560
So they're going to have two Saurons.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
Wait, you know what it'll be?

17:18.560 --> 17:19.560
It'll be like...

17:19.560 --> 17:20.560
Oh, no.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.560
No, I feel like the Hobo could be a red herring.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
Maybe.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.560
It still is a red herring.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.560
Or they could be, like, both Saurons, and you've got to combine them into, like, one

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
guy, like a fusion dance.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.560
Oh, God, he's splintered his soul or something?

17:34.560 --> 17:35.560
Yeah.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.560
I'm super smart, by the way.

17:41.560 --> 17:46.560
Somebody needs to be, once again, begging Arch for forgiveness and calling him smart.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.560
He's fucking Sauron, too.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.560
Arch is wrong again.

17:50.560 --> 17:51.560
Listen to me.

17:51.560 --> 17:52.560
I'm Halbrand.

17:52.560 --> 17:53.560
I come from Mordor.

17:53.560 --> 17:57.560
I know everything about magic, metal, and shit, which you, the ten thousand year old

17:57.560 --> 17:59.560
smith, would never know.

17:59.560 --> 18:00.560
Retard.

18:00.560 --> 18:01.560
A gift.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.560
Sticky Sauron, too.

18:03.560 --> 18:04.560
A gift.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.560
They're all Sauron.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.560
Everyone's Sauron.

18:06.560 --> 18:07.560
I'm a Sauron.

18:07.560 --> 18:08.560
It's like Battlestar Galactica.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.560
We're all Sirens.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.560
We're all Sirens.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.560
I hear online that this Phaseron guy is also Sauron.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.560
This, like, marks here.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.560
No, Phaseron is not Sauron.

18:21.560 --> 18:25.560
He was manipulated by Sauron.

18:25.560 --> 18:29.560
Okay, so who's gonna start talking to him and manipulating him?

18:29.560 --> 18:33.560
Well, I'm sure Halbrand will probably pop him again soon or something.

18:33.560 --> 18:38.560
Or, I think they've just dropped the entire Numenor plotline.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.560
Maybe she's Sauron, too.

18:43.560 --> 18:46.560
Their understanding of art is really advanced.

18:47.560 --> 18:52.560
And, now they've got paper instead of that fucking papyrus shit they were having earlier.

18:52.560 --> 18:57.560
I want to see mommy milkers one more time before I go.

18:57.560 --> 19:02.560
Let me, let me feel with my hand.

19:02.560 --> 19:09.560
By the way, for all of the flaws of House of the Dragon, they did a much better Dying

19:09.560 --> 19:12.560
King set of scenes than this show did.

19:12.560 --> 19:13.560
You're mistaken.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.560
Wait, what?

19:14.560 --> 19:15.560
What do you mean next up?

19:15.560 --> 19:16.560
Next up, fuck off.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.560
Sorry, that's too pop up.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.560
Sink, but yes.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.560
I mean, this king is about dying.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.560
I don't make this mistake, too, in paratrauma.

19:27.560 --> 19:28.560
Like, our ship is falling.

19:28.560 --> 19:29.560
No, Kyle, it's sinking.

19:29.560 --> 19:30.560
The king!

19:30.560 --> 19:31.560
Help!

19:31.560 --> 19:33.560
Well, it falls to the ocean bottom.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
Oh my god, the rings of power.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.560
Is he gonna die in time?

19:37.560 --> 19:39.560
Wait, he vanished.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.560
Uh oh.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.560
Maybe he's Sauron.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.560
He got spry all of a sudden.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.560
This is a rather random plot point.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.560
This is.

19:51.560 --> 19:55.560
I feel like this only exists so we have some reason to care about whomever this is.

19:55.560 --> 20:00.560
Yeah, because to be honest, besides her boobs, there's not much else to her.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.560
And her tits could be bigger.

20:02.560 --> 20:03.560
Yeah, they could use a-

20:03.560 --> 20:05.560
They could CGI those up a little bit.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.560
Well, you don't want it too big.

20:06.560 --> 20:07.560
Otherwise they'd get droopy and say-

20:07.560 --> 20:08.560
I don't know.

20:08.560 --> 20:10.560
They could be larger.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.560
What manner of object?

20:12.560 --> 20:13.560
A ring!

20:22.560 --> 20:23.560
He's a cringe.

20:34.560 --> 20:35.560
This is so stupid.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.560
God help her.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.560
Yeah, how rings work.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.560
All that power upon the brow of one being.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.560
You've just ruined the mystery.

20:46.560 --> 20:49.560
Suggestions were but the key that unlocked the dam.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.560
We are on the cusp of-

20:52.560 --> 20:54.560
Jesus, they really want to-

20:54.560 --> 20:55.560
Okay.

20:55.560 --> 20:57.560
Strength but of spirit.

20:57.560 --> 21:00.560
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.560
Galadriel's gaydar is tingling.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.560
Wait, hold on.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.560
Are you a traitorous faggot?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.560
Are you Sauron?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.560
Again, the fucking story telling.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.560
Do we need a rebellious moment here?

21:16.560 --> 21:18.560
Do we need the scene where he goes like,

21:18.560 --> 21:20.560
No, I'll do it anyways.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.560
Do we need that?

21:21.560 --> 21:23.560
Why the fuck do we need that?

21:23.560 --> 21:26.560
We need more drama to keep the viewers engaged.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.560
Drama no matter what.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.560
That's probably what the school taught them.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.560
Wherever writing school they came from.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.560
If they went to school.

21:45.560 --> 21:48.560
Oh my god, the fucking mithril's making him do it.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
Does it matter?

21:49.560 --> 21:51.560
Of course.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
Oh wait, so wait.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
What does it matter?

21:53.560 --> 21:56.560
All mithril has the same corrupting powers?

21:56.560 --> 21:57.560
That'd be ridiculous.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.560
At least Frodo was wearing a shirt of that shit.

21:59.560 --> 22:01.560
I mowed that much.

22:01.560 --> 22:06.560
No, no, I think they're suggesting that Halbrand somehow talked him into it.

22:06.560 --> 22:11.560
The problem is, all of this bullshit drama is replacing the drama we should have.

22:11.560 --> 22:18.560
Which is Halbrand very, very, very slowly talking the elves into this idea.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.560
Like suggesting, hinting.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.560
Instead he just walks in there and goes like,

22:23.560 --> 22:25.560
Why have you made it into a ring?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.560
Like, oh, brilliant.

22:28.560 --> 22:32.560
I love how Halbrand's just a part of the smithing crew now.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.560
Like, you told me something incredibly obvious.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.560
Be my apprentice.

22:36.560 --> 22:39.560
Yeah, we needed like three scenes.

22:39.560 --> 22:44.560
Three or four scenes of him talking to that guy and like getting him warmed up to it.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.560
Not just, oh, he's here now.

22:46.560 --> 22:54.560
What gets to me is just like, until now we've never even heard of Halbrand being like a ring maker or metal worker much.

22:54.560 --> 23:01.560
We saw him like one scene doing it in, um, fuck, what was it called?

23:01.560 --> 23:02.560
The island.

23:02.560 --> 23:05.560
He's fucked around with the foraging like twice.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.560
Yeah, I can see how the...

23:06.560 --> 23:08.560
Okay, maybe I just didn't remember.

23:08.560 --> 23:14.560
But like, I don't think it was like ever stated that he was like a super expert at it, so.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.560
Just that he wanted to do it.

23:15.560 --> 23:19.560
Well, so far he's been a traveler, a sailor, a smith, a king.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.560
Someone like me.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.560
Yeah.

23:26.560 --> 23:27.560
Yeah.

23:27.560 --> 23:28.560
Someone like me, Sauron.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.560
Right next to you, Galadriel.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.560
You've been looking for me for so long.

23:42.560 --> 23:43.560
She saved Sauron's life.

23:45.560 --> 23:46.560
No.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.560
Yes.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.560
He believed in me.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.560
Oh my god, that's true, she did.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.560
He pushed me to heights that no one else could have.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.560
See, oh my god.

24:01.560 --> 24:07.560
This, in a better show, this would have been an excellent fucking scene.

24:10.560 --> 24:17.560
See, if this was in a show where you never suspected who this guy was, this would have been a fucking good scene.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.560
But it isn't, it's in the rings of power.

24:19.560 --> 24:25.560
It would be one of those scenes where like on your second watch through you could see all the little things.

24:25.560 --> 24:30.560
Yep, and he's like, you believed in me, you pushed me, you made me stronger.

24:30.560 --> 24:35.560
Like that would have been a fucking chill scene if it wasn't in the rings of power.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.560
See, they're trying to fucking do the two thing.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.560
Me stars!

25:11.560 --> 25:13.560
I don't think that's how that works.

25:14.560 --> 25:18.560
You fell from the stars, yet you are greater than they.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.560
Why is everyone echoing?

25:21.560 --> 25:22.560
Because it's dramatic.

25:23.560 --> 25:29.560
In time he will learn to control his powers, for now bind him.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.560
They're messing up my hair.

25:31.560 --> 25:35.560
Oh look, it's a little concept on YouTube.

25:36.560 --> 25:37.560
It's a horror flute.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.560
Oh god, I hate the horror flute so much.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.560
Totally bad.

25:42.560 --> 25:43.560
Now's our chance.

25:45.560 --> 25:47.560
To get what, fucking killed?

25:48.560 --> 25:50.560
Yeah, well I expected to against him.

25:52.560 --> 25:53.560
They're just gonna set you on fire.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.560
They're harfoots, they've got guerilla memes, okay.

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
I'm afraid they're like little Vietnamese people.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.560
See like the Ewoks, like they'll swing logs down.

26:04.560 --> 26:10.560
When the trees start speaking harfoot, oh they just, they just left, they just left him okay, nevermind.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.560
Well they didn't, then we're gonna get out.

26:13.560 --> 26:15.560
The third person is gonna show up at the last second.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.560
Gotcha kids.

26:18.560 --> 26:20.560
She's gonna show off, off screen.

26:21.560 --> 26:22.560
Watch this.

26:23.560 --> 26:26.560
Oh no, the third person is the bad bitch.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.560
Thank you, that was kind of a clever double.

26:30.560 --> 26:35.560
It doesn't make sense because the harfoots were looking straight at them when they did this, but details, details.

26:40.560 --> 26:41.560
Run.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.560
Oh no, a tiny harfoot is uh.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.560
Oh no.

26:46.560 --> 26:47.560
Nice.

26:47.560 --> 26:48.560
Yes.

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
Goodbye.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.560
Thank you.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
Now twist the knife, make sure.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.560
No, he fell off screen, he's still alive, no.

26:54.560 --> 26:56.560
That's unfortunate, he is still alive.

26:57.560 --> 26:58.560
Fuck.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.560
Well that was a good choice.

27:00.560 --> 27:01.560
Black man dies, archers.

27:04.560 --> 27:05.560
Actually you know what?

27:06.560 --> 27:13.560
So on Andor this week, of the six main characters there was two black guys and they killed them both.

27:14.560 --> 27:16.560
All the black people are dying on TV right now.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.560
But tragically both lesbians survived.

27:20.560 --> 27:22.560
Hey listen, they're both kind of cute.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.560
I don't know about that.

27:25.560 --> 27:26.560
I do.

27:27.560 --> 27:28.560
Deadeye force push.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.560
I'm sorry.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.560
How is that troll sticking to your head there woman?

27:40.560 --> 27:41.560
It's a bit weird.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.560
Wait, how is Sauron losing the mage fight?

27:45.560 --> 27:47.560
I just noticed her staff is the eye.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.560
Look at her staff, it's the eye.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.560
Well yes Dev.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.560
Are you some kind of dev?

27:57.560 --> 27:58.560
Oh cool, Batarangs.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.560
Okay, that was pretty funny.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.560
That was good.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.560
The little lottery.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.560
Batarangs.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.560
That's why there's just a fuck you master.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.560
Yeah, exactly.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.560
If I were Sauron, I'd say that's a good choice.

28:30.560 --> 28:36.560
If I were Sauron, I'd just be like, you're fired.

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
Look at the stoners.

28:47.560 --> 28:48.560
Defeated by nuts and berries.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.560
Oh, she can't detect them anymore.

28:54.560 --> 28:56.560
I'm really mad, I'm going to burn all of you.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.560
They're hidden behind leaves, everybody.

29:02.560 --> 29:03.560
Uh oh.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.560
Couldn't she just light everything on fire like she did before?

29:08.560 --> 29:09.560
Yep, that's what she needed to do.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.560
Oh shit.

29:14.560 --> 29:17.560
Come on, please kill at least one of the harplets, I pray.

29:18.560 --> 29:19.560
One of them at least.

29:20.560 --> 29:21.560
Nah, they got too much plot armor.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.560
Oh no, my harpits, they're burning.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.560
This is just a normal California summer, after a gender reveal party.

29:36.560 --> 29:44.560
See, now, if anything, I'm slowly growing more skeptical, because they're laying on the herring a little bit too thick right now.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.560
It's very thick.

29:47.560 --> 29:48.560
This is the problem though.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.560
It reveals that this is how Gandalf was formed.

29:51.560 --> 29:58.560
The issue is, they're double layering the story so thick that neither outcome makes sense anymore.

29:59.560 --> 30:00.560
Yeah.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.560
My $20 is in limbo.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.560
Wait, is he just surviving?

30:06.560 --> 30:07.560
After getting stabbed in the gut?

30:08.560 --> 30:11.560
I mean, you fuckers still have knives, you could just stab them.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.560
Check with the Batarangs, could throw them.

30:22.560 --> 30:26.560
Suck it! Get on your knees!

30:27.560 --> 30:28.560
I'm good.

30:35.560 --> 30:36.560
Oh, they're ringwraiths.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.560
Wait, how?

30:39.560 --> 30:40.560
They can't be ringwraiths.

30:41.560 --> 30:42.560
Oh, personally can be ringwraiths.

30:47.560 --> 30:48.560
They're moths.

30:49.560 --> 30:50.560
Yeah.

30:51.560 --> 30:52.560
Barge.

30:55.560 --> 30:56.560
Ooh, that ringwraith style.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
He's Nistar.

30:59.560 --> 31:00.560
Okay, so which wizard is he then?

31:01.560 --> 31:02.560
Nothing.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.560
I hope it's the white wizard.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.560
Saruman?

31:07.560 --> 31:08.560
Yep, Saruman.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.560
Before he became a, you know, black-filled wizard.

31:17.560 --> 31:18.560
Oh, thank god he's gonna die.

31:19.560 --> 31:20.560
Oh, he's gonna be saved by magic.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.560
Please, TV show, at least give me this.

31:26.560 --> 31:27.560
They're gonna.

31:28.560 --> 31:30.560
You don't think the maid is gonna heal him?

31:31.560 --> 31:32.560
Nope, because he just nodded.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.560
He's like, yep, I'm not healing you.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.560
He pissed off the priest one too many times in the dungeon.

31:40.560 --> 31:42.560
Oh god, that's quick. He's going fast.

31:47.560 --> 31:48.560
He's going sitting up?

31:51.560 --> 31:52.560
Yeah.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.560
And he still, some still say his skeletons are there to this day.

32:00.560 --> 32:01.560
You know, I'm having fun with this episode.

32:02.560 --> 32:06.560
The thing is, I'm still not even sold that he's a wizard.

32:07.560 --> 32:11.560
Because the problem is, he can't be a wizard from the timeline.

32:12.560 --> 32:18.560
And they have doubled back on what he is so many times.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.560
He can be, because they're just making shit up at this point.

32:22.560 --> 32:27.560
Oh they are, but the thing is, they've doubled back on this like twelve times now.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.560
From good to evil to evil to good to good to evil.

32:31.560 --> 32:32.560
Keep your guessing, right?

32:34.560 --> 32:43.560
What they're doing is, you know, they made the Balrog show up, and the wizard show up, and Mount Doom first erupt.

32:43.560 --> 32:50.560
In the same week. And these things did not happen anywhere close to each other in the timeline.

32:53.560 --> 32:56.560
This is very convenient that they all happen all at once, Dev.

32:59.560 --> 33:04.560
The issue is too though, the wizards are out in the third age.

33:05.560 --> 33:10.560
Which means that Amazon literally does not have the rights to the wizards.

33:10.560 --> 33:17.560
Hey wait a second. She's down in the hold of the ship practicing.

33:18.560 --> 33:25.560
I mean the implication is that she's practicing being blind in public so that no one knows she's blind.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.560
That's what it seems like is happening right now.

33:28.560 --> 33:33.560
But in the last episode there was that scene of her on the deck of the ship with her blindfold on.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.560
Yes.

33:36.560 --> 33:37.560
Yes, Dev.

33:37.560 --> 33:40.560
Yes, Dev. Yes, it doesn't make sense, Dev. Come here, Dev.

33:41.560 --> 33:42.560
Dev, Dev, Dev.

33:47.560 --> 33:50.560
This is the rings of power in a nutshell right here.

33:51.560 --> 34:01.560
This is why even that theoretically great scene with Halbrand is actually shit, because this is what the show does normally.

34:02.560 --> 34:08.560
Maybe Taftash had the right idea, getting sick and bowing out.

34:09.560 --> 34:12.560
This entire blind plotline is...

34:13.560 --> 34:20.560
It feels like one of the two showrunners wrote half of it and the other guy wrote the other half and they never spoke about it.

34:21.560 --> 34:24.560
So one's like, oh she'll be a really strong queen because she'll pretend not to be blind.

34:25.560 --> 34:28.560
And the other guy's like, well she's blind now, I guess she's got a blindfold.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.560
You gotta make her a demon hunter from Warcraft.

34:34.560 --> 34:40.560
Kibbs gets it, because he's actually playing Warcraft right now, you fucking Blizzard shill traitor.

34:41.560 --> 34:46.560
This episode's actually been the most entertaining. Not for any good reasons, but because it's very funny.

34:48.560 --> 34:51.560
I'm just very glad that at least one of the Harfords is finally dead.

34:52.560 --> 34:55.560
This is the first time I've enjoyed the show. Like, wow.

34:56.560 --> 35:01.560
I'm just very glad the show's almost fucking over. Are we really doing season two?

35:02.560 --> 35:06.560
Yeah, but it's in two years time, so I wouldn't worry about it.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.560
And by then we'll be dead. One of us will have died of old age.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.560
My bet is on Dev.

35:13.560 --> 35:14.560
I can't fucking wait.

35:15.560 --> 35:18.560
Time to pretend to not be blind in front of all the people who have seen me with a blindfold.

35:19.560 --> 35:20.560
No, she has a blindfold.

35:21.560 --> 35:22.560
Alright.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.560
Oh, hi. Oh, Jesus. Alright, well, never mind.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.560
So, what specifically was she practicing down there?

35:37.560 --> 35:39.560
She was practicing pissing me off.

35:42.560 --> 35:45.560
Black flags, ma'am. You're fucking dead's dead.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.560
Ta-da!

35:47.560 --> 35:49.560
You're right. Black flags.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.560
I feel bad for the guy who didn't go up to that fucking mountain to do that one.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.560
Just hanging there.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.560
He's like, Jim, I'm gonna need you to go up there. Like, please, no.

36:06.560 --> 36:07.560
It's a living.

36:08.560 --> 36:11.560
Man, I would have felt really bad if I knew who the fuck this guy was.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.560
It's Santa.

36:14.560 --> 36:15.560
If only he had any screen time.

36:16.560 --> 36:17.560
Staring at him with loving eyes.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.560
Oh, they died.

36:22.560 --> 36:23.560
What the fuck happened?

36:23.560 --> 36:25.560
No, no, this is the elves again.

36:26.560 --> 36:28.560
They're making the rings and they're fucking up a bit.

36:29.560 --> 36:30.560
Oh, you idiots.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.560
Oh my god, I thought it was a terrorist attack. Like, they're 9-11 in the Numenor.

36:35.560 --> 36:36.560
Also, hold the fuck on.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.560
Who puts their smith at the top of a tower?

36:42.560 --> 36:43.560
Thank you.

36:44.560 --> 36:45.560
Galadriel.

36:45.560 --> 36:47.560
Pushing ourselves too high.

36:52.560 --> 36:53.560
That's it.

36:54.560 --> 36:55.560
Oh god, it is.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.560
Of course it is.

36:57.560 --> 36:58.560
Fucking hell.

37:00.560 --> 37:01.560
That's it.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
I've got it now.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.560
Why did I think of that?

37:05.560 --> 37:06.560
Drawn or coaxed.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.560
God damn, Galadriel just has to do everything in this show.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
Everything inside out.

37:13.560 --> 37:15.560
Yes, because this is how metal works.

37:16.560 --> 37:20.560
Sometimes you gotta pet the metal and then it'll just, you know, bind with other metals.

37:21.560 --> 37:22.560
That's how this works.

37:23.560 --> 37:24.560
That's how it's doing a good job.

37:27.560 --> 37:28.560
Here's this thing.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.560
Stroke it gently and then it'll become iron and that's how steel is made.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.560
You whisper gently into the ears of iron and copper and steel.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.560
Armor.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.560
God, I just read something really shocking.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
Stupid.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.560
And it rolled away from me because it's on a scroll.

37:54.560 --> 37:55.560
Gasparuni.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
Uh oh.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.560
The last man to bear your crest died over a thousand years ago.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.560
He had no heir.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.560
I read there, he had no heir.

38:21.560 --> 38:23.560
No, on the raft you saved me.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.560
On the raft, you saved me.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.560
You convinced Myrios to save the men of Middle-earth.

38:28.560 --> 38:29.560
Oh.

38:29.560 --> 38:30.560
Isaron.

38:31.560 --> 38:34.560
The evil music is revealing it to us.

38:35.560 --> 38:36.560
And mine.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.560
Tell me your name.

38:45.560 --> 38:48.560
I have been awake since before the breaking of the first silence.

38:50.560 --> 38:51.560
And outside.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.560
I have had many names.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.560
Why would you reveal it here, though?

39:00.560 --> 39:05.560
Again, you know, this should be a good scene, but the acting is fucking up a bit here.

39:05.560 --> 39:06.560
Like, Letter's actually doing okay.

39:07.560 --> 39:08.560
But.

39:09.560 --> 39:10.560
He, like.

39:11.560 --> 39:13.560
There should have been a bit more of a smile on his face.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.560
He should have been a little bit more sinister.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.560
They should have shaded him a bit more.

39:17.560 --> 39:18.560
Also.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.560
He hasn't made the rings yet.

39:21.560 --> 39:22.560
This isn't when you...

39:22.560 --> 39:23.560
Oh God, alright.

39:24.560 --> 39:26.560
Well, he's made her into a common as it's fine.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.560
Hello, I'm the brother from episode one.

39:31.560 --> 39:35.560
I've had a grand total of five seconds of screen time, but you should remember me.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.560
He was seeking a power.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.560
Not to destroy Middle Earth.

39:42.560 --> 39:43.560
But to heal it.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.560
He's the good guy.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
If it was your fellow elves.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.560
Why would you say such a thing?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.560
Damn them CGI tears.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.560
You can't even get the actors to actually cry anymore.

39:58.560 --> 39:59.560
Geez.

40:00.560 --> 40:01.560
Look at me!

40:04.560 --> 40:05.560
Oh, now we're on the ship.

40:06.560 --> 40:07.560
Well, the ship.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.560
You know who I am.

40:13.560 --> 40:14.560
I am your friend.

40:15.560 --> 40:16.560
I want her to start pulling on the thing again.

40:17.560 --> 40:18.560
He's just gaslighting.

40:21.560 --> 40:24.560
This is like, oh, I'm going to take you to the fantasy world to gaslight you non-stop.

40:25.560 --> 40:27.560
I told you that I had done evil and you did not care.

40:28.560 --> 40:31.560
Because you knew that our past meant nothing.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.560
Weighed against our future.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.560
Wait.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.560
Wait.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.560
So women make him evil?

40:41.560 --> 40:42.560
Someone's actually good.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.560
He got dumped by Galadriel and that's why he turns evil.

40:47.560 --> 40:48.560
He's an incel.

40:51.560 --> 40:52.560
I get it now.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.560
That was a forced scene. I didn't like that.

40:58.560 --> 40:59.560
Yeah.

41:02.560 --> 41:06.560
There is, there is fucking meat to this.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.560
That's what annoys me, but there's no setup.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.560
And I really,

41:14.560 --> 41:17.560
I fucking hate his actor when it comes to this.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.560
Like he doesn't have that charisma that he really should have here.

41:23.560 --> 41:24.560
That gravitas.

41:25.560 --> 41:26.560
Oh my God.

41:27.560 --> 41:29.560
Taking that line from the fucking movie.

41:39.560 --> 41:47.560
I mean, I think this guy could do it, but they just needed an actual show behind it and not just this nonsense.

41:48.560 --> 41:51.560
The romance thing is really cringe though, I will say that much.

41:52.560 --> 41:53.560
I see.

42:01.560 --> 42:11.560
I don't mind that because he's the one trying to seduce her and there's no indication that he actually necessarily gives a shit, but he wants her power and she's got him by the walls.

42:21.560 --> 42:23.560
Yeah, that too was just a fuck.

42:25.560 --> 42:29.560
He doesn't look like Sauron because you give him slit eyes. Like this isn't how this works.

42:30.560 --> 42:31.560
Not gonna lie.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.560
This is really dumb.

42:34.560 --> 42:38.560
No, no, no, no, no. This is the cleverest the show has ever been, which is sad.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.560
Clever for a show, terrible for Lord of the Rings.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.560
But the thing is, this works.

42:45.560 --> 42:51.560
If only it had been constructed better. If only it had been acted better, shot better.

42:52.560 --> 42:53.560
If only it wasn't this.

42:54.560 --> 43:02.560
Like, this is a genuinely fine story point, but very poorly delivered.

43:12.560 --> 43:19.560
Oh, Arch, the comments corrected us from last week. Elrond apparently always was a half-elf.

43:20.560 --> 43:30.560
Also, wait a second. How does that prove that Elrond's real if that's something that Galadriel knows and Sauron can just take it from her mind?

43:31.560 --> 43:34.560
Can he take it from her mind? Does he have that Jedi power?

43:35.560 --> 43:36.560
Yeah, that's what we've been doing this whole time.

43:36.560 --> 43:47.560
Like, you'd have to ask a question that you didn't know the answer to, but would sound real to you when they gave it to you.

43:55.560 --> 43:56.560
Just tell him.

43:56.560 --> 43:58.560
You are making that promise very difficult to keep.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.560
Very easy. It would not require trust.

44:02.560 --> 44:05.560
Really, bitch? You're gonna just sweep this one under the rug?

44:06.560 --> 44:10.560
Why wouldn't you tell everyone? This was Sauron.

44:11.560 --> 44:16.560
She has to be mysterious. She has to be cryptic for no reason.

44:17.560 --> 44:18.560
Three?

44:20.560 --> 44:21.560
I want one. That's why.

44:23.560 --> 44:24.560
Two will divide.

44:24.560 --> 44:27.560
But with three, there is balance.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.560
And we each get one.

44:34.560 --> 44:35.560
There is no sense.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.560
Must be for the elves alone.

44:39.560 --> 44:41.560
Untouched by other hands.

44:42.560 --> 44:47.560
Oh, shit. We've literally rewritten the entire fucking origin of the Rings of Power.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.560
You have potential, Arch.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.560
I need gold and silver.

44:54.560 --> 44:56.560
The most exquisite quality.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.560
I need gold and silver from Valinor.

45:04.560 --> 45:09.560
True creation requires a dagger sacrifice.

45:10.560 --> 45:15.560
Oh, God. Now she can melt that down to cut herself from her brother. Oh, God, that's okay.

45:17.560 --> 45:19.560
Do you remember anything more yet?

45:20.560 --> 45:21.560
Fragments.

45:22.560 --> 45:29.560
Oh, look, the Harfoots are settling down to farm like nomadic communities usually do.

45:30.560 --> 45:33.560
This is the origin story as to why the hobbits started to settle.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.560
It's awful, but you know.

45:37.560 --> 45:39.560
In your tongue, that means wise one.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.560
Oh.

45:43.560 --> 45:45.560
Wizard.

45:46.560 --> 45:47.560
Yeah.

45:48.560 --> 45:49.560
Arch, you were wrong.

45:49.560 --> 45:51.560
No, I'm still not admitting it.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.560
You can't. You've been defeated.

45:54.560 --> 45:58.560
I can. I absolutely can, because they've made him good and then evil and then evil and then good again and again.

45:59.560 --> 46:00.560
This is just another part of it.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.560
So which...

46:04.560 --> 46:06.560
Because he can't be a wizard. Literally.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.560
There is no way he can be.

46:09.560 --> 46:10.560
Why?

46:11.560 --> 46:14.560
Because the wizard was specifically sent as a response to Sauron.

46:15.560 --> 46:16.560
Yeah.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.560
And they were sent in the third age.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.560
Sorry, Arch, but that's old lore. It's been changed.

46:23.560 --> 46:25.560
Yeah, give it the time, boomer.

46:30.560 --> 46:32.560
At least we're almost done, I think.

46:33.560 --> 46:34.560
Okay, let's hover over it.

46:35.560 --> 46:36.560
It's like 20 minutes left.

46:37.560 --> 46:38.560
Arch, jump out a window.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.560
I would rather do something else.

46:44.560 --> 46:47.560
The funny parts are over. I'm no longer enjoying this.

46:50.560 --> 46:51.560
I don't.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.560
I'm quite happy we killed at least one half-foot.

46:55.560 --> 46:57.560
One casualty is a good start.

46:58.560 --> 47:00.560
It's a beginning. We've got a long way to go.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.560
Is he the only named character that's dead?

47:04.560 --> 47:05.560
In the entire season?

47:08.560 --> 47:09.560
I think so.

47:10.560 --> 47:11.560
Well, the king was named.

47:12.560 --> 47:14.560
Well, but he wasn't a character character.

47:15.560 --> 47:16.560
That's true.

47:16.560 --> 47:19.560
So technically, the black guy dicked a hearse.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.560
Oh, good. So she's only going to follow her story with this star.

47:24.560 --> 47:27.560
We're not going to fucking watch the rest of them in season two.

47:28.560 --> 47:32.560
Well, I'm going on an adventure.

47:33.560 --> 47:36.560
Maybe all of the others will be wiped out off-screen.

47:37.560 --> 47:38.560
Hopefully.

47:38.560 --> 47:44.560
The best part is, what they've done here is they basically said that it was actually women were the first adventuring hobbits.

47:47.560 --> 47:49.560
Little girl. What the fuck? Where'd she come from?

47:52.560 --> 47:54.560
They just breed real fast.

47:55.560 --> 47:56.560
Jesus Christ.

47:57.560 --> 48:00.560
You know, after sex, an acorn pops out of the woman's vagina.

48:01.560 --> 48:05.560
In two or three weeks after planting, it'll just sprout right up.

48:06.560 --> 48:08.560
Ain't no stuff. Not a vagina. That'd be weird.

48:09.560 --> 48:11.560
Like a gross barge. I know it's hard for you.

48:11.560 --> 48:14.560
We're birds has preferences.

48:17.560 --> 48:20.560
I feel bad for these poor actors. They were like, oh, that's going to be great for my career.

48:21.560 --> 48:22.560
It's going to look great.

48:23.560 --> 48:24.560
Rest in peace, bro.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.560
Like a sign language thing.

48:27.560 --> 48:32.560
I will actually say one good thing about the Harfoot's their music, their aesthetic, their accents.

48:33.560 --> 48:37.560
It reminds me a lot of that GameCube game, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

48:38.560 --> 48:39.560
It's the exact same like theming.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.560
Irish. And dirty.

48:43.560 --> 48:44.560
Yeah.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.560
Sick of the Harfoot's now. Kill them all. Move on.

48:48.560 --> 48:52.560
They're dirty hair. They're dirty hands. They're dirty faces.

48:53.560 --> 48:57.560
It feels like they've done this, this goodbye scene, like three big hugs now.

48:58.560 --> 49:02.560
They kind of have, because there's also different stories where they're doing like goodbye things.

49:03.560 --> 49:06.560
I had to get one for every story. We have yet to get one for the black elf.

49:06.560 --> 49:08.560
Or maybe hit the way he's over.

49:09.560 --> 49:13.560
By the way, there's some race mixing going on here and yet all of the children are white. Explain.

49:14.560 --> 49:16.560
One gene is stronger than the other, apparently.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.560
Oh, no. Fat Sam.

49:20.560 --> 49:22.560
Well, Sam was always kind of fat.

49:23.560 --> 49:27.560
Ploppé. Actually, Ploppé would be a better name. Ploppé.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.560
Don't come with. Don't come with.

49:31.560 --> 49:34.560
Why does everyone I love the most always have to go away?

49:34.560 --> 49:37.560
I don't know. It's never happened before, so, you know.

49:38.560 --> 49:39.560
Is she going to come along?

49:40.560 --> 49:41.560
No, please.

49:42.560 --> 49:43.560
Oh, Ploppé.

49:46.560 --> 49:48.560
It sounds like she's, she's not. Okay.

49:49.560 --> 49:59.560
See, the whole reason that you had to have Frodo and Sam is, is thematically, is because by the end of the journey when, when Frodo couldn't do it, Sam could do the rest of it.

50:00.560 --> 50:03.560
And he was supposed to be the anchor back to the ordinary world.

50:04.560 --> 50:06.560
That was the point of their friendship.

50:07.560 --> 50:11.560
Well, it's, Jesus Christ Arch. It's, it's more that like, there's that final...

50:12.560 --> 50:13.560
No, no. He literally was a manservant.

50:14.560 --> 50:19.560
He was, he was. But there was that final scene where Frodo says, there's no veil between me and the Ring of Fire.

50:20.560 --> 50:27.560
And he's basically saying that the Ring's influence has made him forget everything good in life and he is absorbed by nihilism.

50:28.560 --> 50:31.560
And Sam had to be that anchor back to what was meaningful in life.

50:31.560 --> 50:35.560
Constantly reminding him about the strawberries and everything else and good in the world.

50:36.560 --> 50:41.560
Yeah. Yeah. But you don't need a Sam character for this kind of journey.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.560
Always follow your nose.

50:48.560 --> 50:49.560
Always follow your nose.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.560
God damn it, Arch. How do you know?

50:52.560 --> 50:54.560
It's a saying. How do you not know, Dev?

50:56.560 --> 50:59.560
It's Gandalf. Fuck me. I hate it.

51:01.560 --> 51:05.560
I love it because Barch is me and he is.

51:06.560 --> 51:07.560
Thing is, I'm still not sold on it either.

51:08.560 --> 51:10.560
You will be. Because Sauron was a Maiar as well.

51:11.560 --> 51:13.560
Yeah, but he's a different Maiar. He's almost...

51:14.560 --> 51:15.560
No. No, they're not.

51:16.560 --> 51:17.560
The Maiar or the Maiar?

51:18.560 --> 51:21.560
On the double fake, it's over, Barch. You lost. You got to have one.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.560
Maiar or the Maiar?

51:24.560 --> 51:26.560
I'm going to put Kibbs in my $20.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.560
Listen, Dev. It was that or defeating Barch?

51:31.560 --> 51:32.560
A worthy sacrifice.

51:33.560 --> 51:37.560
You know, he really should have removed the blade from that first.

51:38.560 --> 51:40.560
That's going to fuck up the composition of something awful.

51:41.560 --> 51:45.560
Yeah, but the implication is that the handle is the gold and the blade is the silver.

51:46.560 --> 51:50.560
Yep. Dev, do I need to teach you about how soft silver is?

51:51.560 --> 51:54.560
Oh no, I know. But the show doesn't know. The show doesn't know.

51:55.560 --> 51:59.560
And even then, you wouldn't mix the silver and the fucking gold. That's dumb too.

51:59.560 --> 52:05.560
Well, the idea is they're mixing silver, gold, and mithril to make the magic of the rings.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.560
Yeah, but they do not mix really, though.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.560
Hold on, though. Hold on a second.

52:13.560 --> 52:19.560
So, the original story was that they made all the rings. There was nine, five, and three at the same time.

52:20.560 --> 52:23.560
But also that Sauron made a hidden ring at the same time.

52:24.560 --> 52:25.560
Yes.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.560
But they're already making three right now?

52:27.560 --> 52:28.560
Yes.

52:29.560 --> 52:30.560
They're making them at different times now.

52:31.560 --> 52:35.560
That's why we've got to have like five fucking seasons so they can make the rings little by little.

52:39.560 --> 52:40.560
Just drop that shit in.

52:41.560 --> 52:46.560
This is how you make an alloy right here. You just fucking plump that bitch down there and voila.

52:47.560 --> 52:48.560
It's like a magical...

52:49.560 --> 52:50.560
Look, it's an eye!

52:51.560 --> 52:52.560
Oh my god, it's evil.

52:53.560 --> 52:54.560
Making cabbage soup.

52:54.560 --> 52:57.560
There you go. It didn't need pressure, it just needed light stirring.

53:01.560 --> 53:02.560
Like most metallic alloys.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.560
They got to bend them.

53:07.560 --> 53:11.560
Oh, that's brilliant. That's actually brilliant.

53:16.560 --> 53:21.560
I prefer the scene in the movies where there are like five elves wailing on it with hammers.

53:22.560 --> 53:25.560
Elrond is getting suspicious.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.560
He's doing his CSI thing.

53:29.560 --> 53:33.560
That paper would not be legible after this.

53:34.560 --> 53:35.560
Yeah.

53:36.560 --> 53:37.560
It's magic ink. Don't think about it.

53:38.560 --> 53:39.560
Magic paper.

53:40.560 --> 53:42.560
Oh, don't help. This isn't who he said he was.

53:45.560 --> 53:49.560
Ah yes, completely uncut gems. Brilliant.

53:50.560 --> 53:51.560
It's just pop rocks.

53:55.560 --> 53:59.560
Whoops, I'm too late. Bitch already corrupted. Well, fuck.

54:01.560 --> 54:02.560
Wait, how is it corrupted?

54:03.560 --> 54:05.560
Wait, what if that's...

54:07.560 --> 54:08.560
Sauron was just like...

54:08.560 --> 54:09.560
Those are Sauron's rings.

54:10.560 --> 54:15.560
Sauron was just like, listen, if you use gold and silver, it'll actually make them my rings.

54:16.560 --> 54:17.560
Why?

54:20.560 --> 54:26.560
Yes, you've already shown us this shot. You missed your opportunity to end credit screen.

54:27.560 --> 54:30.560
Although, that being said, end credit screen in...

54:31.560 --> 54:32.560
What, ten seconds?

54:33.560 --> 54:34.560
We need to see what Halbran's doing.

54:35.560 --> 54:36.560
He's going to Mordor, of course.

54:38.560 --> 54:41.560
Yes, I'd like a tower right over there.

54:42.560 --> 54:44.560
No, a little bit more to the right.

54:44.560 --> 54:51.560
Now end credit in five, four, three, two, one.

54:52.560 --> 54:53.560
Blackness.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.560
Nice hovering your mouse ahead, Barch.

55:01.560 --> 55:02.560
You little shit.

55:03.560 --> 55:08.560
I like how they're now singing, how they were actually made, and they've shown that, no, they didn't do that.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.560
I feel like I just had an hour-long aneurysm.

55:12.560 --> 55:13.560
This is more funny.

55:14.560 --> 55:23.560
No, no, the issue is, once more, they've completely violated absolutely everything.

55:24.560 --> 55:28.560
There's no reason for the story to progress at this point.

55:29.560 --> 55:35.560
The elves have made their rings completely separate from anything else.

55:35.560 --> 55:40.560
Halbran had no influence on these three rings whatsoever beyond going,

55:41.560 --> 55:43.560
maybe you should put them in a centrifuge instead.

55:44.560 --> 55:47.560
There is no reason or rationale for him to have any power over them.

55:48.560 --> 55:57.560
It was very specifically made clear in the original that the rings were made by Sauron's direction.

55:58.560 --> 56:03.560
He'd pre-planned this. He had written it into those rings that they would be bound by the Wand Ring.

56:03.560 --> 56:07.560
It's literally coded into them, but there's no reason for these rings to be.

56:08.560 --> 56:11.560
Now, what is the rationale for making more?

56:12.560 --> 56:14.560
They'll make up a rationale.

56:15.560 --> 56:18.560
That's exactly the problem. They will just make it the fuck up.

56:19.560 --> 56:22.560
Well, that's been the whole problem with the entire show since episode one.

56:23.560 --> 56:28.560
It's all made up. None of this matters. None of this has mattered since the beginning.

56:29.560 --> 56:30.560
None of this mattered now.

56:30.560 --> 56:36.560
Let's assume that you wanted to do the exact same plot line, but good.

56:37.560 --> 56:42.560
The plot already sucks, but let's assume all the major plot beats are going to be in place.

56:43.560 --> 56:48.560
We're talking that the elves still need the mithril to stay alive.

56:49.560 --> 56:58.560
Halbran is still going to be Sauron in the end and still finds Galadriel.

56:58.560 --> 57:01.560
How would you do this show but better?

57:02.560 --> 57:09.560
Well, you'd actually have to take more time and develop an actual blossoming relationship between Galadriel and Halbran.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.560
There would have to be a real seduction there.

57:13.560 --> 57:17.560
He would actually have to worm his way into places a little bit more.

57:18.560 --> 57:22.560
He did that a bit on Numenor. He didn't do it anywhere else.

57:22.560 --> 57:29.560
And honestly, it feels like they had to do that big battle scene in the Southlands to turn it into Mordor,

57:30.560 --> 57:39.560
and they had to get Halbran from Mordor to Lindon to have the let's corrupt the elves bit to make the rings,

57:40.560 --> 57:43.560
and then have him reveal himself. They just rushed it all. They had it all in one episode.

57:44.560 --> 57:47.560
That should have been a full season on its own, Halbran with the elves.

57:48.560 --> 57:51.560
This I'm about to agree with you, and so this is a question about time.

57:52.560 --> 57:59.560
Halbran's character needed far more development, but it's a question of using the time.

58:00.560 --> 58:06.560
The show has so much time, but it's wasted on stupid shit.

58:07.560 --> 58:12.560
The problem is too, Halbran was sus from the beginning because he's a king of the Southlands.

58:13.560 --> 58:19.560
We know that's not true. He's been set adrift by corsairs. We know that's not true.

58:19.560 --> 58:24.560
This is an era of unrivalled peace, and he's in the middle of nowhere.

58:25.560 --> 58:35.560
The setup is far too suspect for anyone to ever look at Halbran with a neutral view, because he's set up that way.

58:36.560 --> 58:42.560
The show falls into its own trap, where it's like, okay, we need everyone to think that everybody's Sauron,

58:43.560 --> 58:49.560
but that just means that your Sauron reveal will fall flat regardless of which character you make Sauron.

58:50.560 --> 58:56.560
It's the same problem with the wizard. They've gone back and forth on him being good and evil like six or seven times,

58:57.560 --> 59:05.560
and even now, the only claim to him being good is that he says that he's an Istar, and then there's a Maiar more correctly,

59:06.560 --> 59:07.560
which, again, Sauron's a Maiar too.

59:07.560 --> 59:13.560
There's also the obvious copyright problems here, and this is one of the things where Amazon is just going to do this

59:14.560 --> 59:22.560
because they know the Tolkien estate can't challenge them, but the wizards are specifically a Third Age property.

59:23.560 --> 59:31.560
Amazon does not have the copyright to them in the same way that they do not have the copyright to the hobbits, which is why they're harfoots.

59:32.560 --> 59:38.560
Well, Arch, these are just going to be some new wizards that we haven't seen before, and they're all going to die before the Third Age.

59:40.560 --> 59:42.560
That would be the way they'd have to do it.

59:43.560 --> 59:49.560
This is something that I've seen with a lot of shows. Any show that has been made in the past five years,

59:50.560 --> 59:55.560
that you see a lot of YouTube channels watching and complaining about, and it's like, oh my god, it's so bad.

59:55.560 --> 01:00:06.560
I see this. I can see, deep within all the shit, the foundation of a possibly good show if they just did everything differently.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:15.560
Ironically, the scenes between Halbaran and Galadriel in this show should have been the culmination of a story.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:21.560
Instead, he recites a handful of times where Galadriel did a handful of things,

01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:26.560
and that entire story could probably be compacted into a single hour or less.

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.560
It's not enough time, and there's not enough subtlety in the plot.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:35.560
It needed more time to develop, and it needed more subtlety.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:41.560
It should have been, what they should have done, that entire scene where Halbaran was like, okay, you made me strong, etc.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:49.560
That should have been the big reveal. It shouldn't then have had a second reveal scene afterwards.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.560
That should have been the big reveal, because they undermined the second reveal massively as well.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:05.560
What you do is, you put them two up, you have like, oh, you know, you drove me, and then you hear the hammer blow of the rings being crafted like dum.

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:12.560
And then you have a flashback to Galadriel chasing him and driving him off so that he ended up on that raft.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.560
You were the one who made me strong and had the dum of the rings being crafted.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.560
And showing her, like, forcing him to run around and become strong and blah blah blah.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.560
Make up something like that, yeah?

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.560
That would have been good, because at that point it would have been too fucking late.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:35.560
Galadriel would have realised her error as it was already too late.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:41.560
The rings were already crafted, Sauron's plot was already complete, and there's nothing she can do about it.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:48.560
Instead now, we have to have some roundabout plot where a bunch of more rings need to be crafted.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:58.560
It will require Galadriel to stay silent about this plot she knows is in the offing, for god only knows how many more seasons.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:06.560
And it will require Halibrand to also make another master ring without any involvement in the other rings.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.560
If the secret ingredients is Mithril, we should make another ring.

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:18.560
Just make a ring that says, like, 14 rings, and in the light bind them. Haha!

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:29.560
Just the new version. I also realised we didn't see the black elf, and we didn't see the dwarves this time around.

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:32.560
I guess they're just out. They're done.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.560
I do think that the black elf storyline is complete though, because that sword arc is over.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.560
His arc is gone. He has no reason to be on the show anymore.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.560
They'll have to come up with one.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:53.560
They won't. I think the story's moving on past that. I think he was just an introductory, like, to the whole fucking back lore as to why Mordor's foundation is.

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.560
Because there's an obsession with, we have to demystify everything and show you everything.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:07.560
Well no, the problem now is, Halbrand's in Mordor, so now there's going to be a conflict with him and Adar, because Adar said specifically that he didn't want to serve Sauron.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.560
And then there'll have to be a redemption arc for him, which will include black elf.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:17.560
Well, we've got four more seasons to go to see.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:28.560
You know what's exciting though? The next season's going to be great, and here's why. Because you know their budget's going to be lower, so there's going to be a serious quality drop in everything.

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:33.560
As the show goes on, it'll probably be comical, I had to hope, right?

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:40.560
Probably. Because already, the only thing that's really impressive about this show is the occasional visuals.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:47.560
God, the problem too is the shooting. The shooting is so fucking bad.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:56.560
Halbrand, when he is revealing that he is Sauron, you should be shooting him, you should have a slight shadow on his face.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.560
Or he should look beatific, like he should look angelic almost, with a hint of darkness.

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.560
You should be shooting him from below and up, making him look sinister, and the actor too.

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:18.560
The actor does not deliver here, in the slightest. He looks weak, soft, fleshy, human, shitty.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:24.560
I don't know if that's necessarily the actor's fault, or more so on the...

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.560
Because they waste the special effects. They should do more with it, with the elves. They should do more with it, with the Sauron reveal.

01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:43.560
Because imagine if they used all that art and CG effort to really show dark tendrils wrapping around him, and then slowly wrapping around Gladiel, showing that his influence was, he was trying to corrupt her.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:50.560
Again, you do this scene, you have the hammering of the ring in the background, you have the dark speak beginning to whisper, etc.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:05:03.560
You could make this a fucking impactful scene, and already, already with the shit ingredients we have, already this is a fairly impactful scene.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:06.560
Imagine if they'd done it well.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.560
Imagine all the people.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:16.560
But even if they did it well, it still undermines the entire story.

01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:25.560
I just realized, the priestess character looks more otherworldly than anyone else in the show.

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:31.560
She does. It's because of the makeup they have her wear, and the fact that they shorten her hair and give her her contact lenses.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.560
Yeah. The way she moves around and stuff, she actually looks like she's a creature from another world.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:43.560
You know, I think the actress that played the main witch lady, she did a pretty good job, she was kind of creepy.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:51.560
But the problem is, I feel bad for all these actors and actresses, even the good ones, is that, you know, what a waste.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:56.560
What a waste of talent with a waste of skill.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.560
Same for the CG artists and everyone else on board this project.

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:05.560
Like damn, all that fucking stuff wasted, because some fucking moron writers had to change a few things.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:12.560
The Rings of Power audience is actually coping right now, because they are using that, like, at least it's not as bad as Tolkien's work.

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:19.560
And these are like, this is the Rings of Power audience, which goes to show that it's mostly made up of zoomers, because they're like, oh okay.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.560
Lord of the Rings to them is Rings of Power. Like that's the Lord of the Rings.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.560
I don't even think that's the case.

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:31.560
It's tragic, but it's true. A lot of people know, a lot of the newer generations, and I know them.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:40.560
And my brothers, like, they're a decade younger than me. Do you ask them what Lord of the Rings is? Peter Jackson films? They'll be like, the what? The who?

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:42.560
Well hold on, hold on.

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560
Wow, those are classics.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:46.560
They still hold up to this day.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560
They do.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:54.560
My girlfriend's a zoomer, and she's like, oh yeah, I watched the original LOPRs again.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.560
Yeah, because you told them.

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:58.560
Oh no, she knew it before me.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:00.560
Hmm, well you lucked out. You got a good dice roll.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:06.560
Most people probably do know, but this is exactly what Amazon wants. Like, I keep making this point.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.560
This will be the future. Amazon is trying to claim the Rings of Power, but Lord of the Rings. That's what they're trying to do.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.560
They're trying to make this the Lord of the Rings.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:21.560
And they would have succeeded if they'd put even the barest amount of effort into it.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:29.560
Because people don't remember. Hell, if people don't remember the Peter Jackson movies, they don't remember the goddamn books. Like, Jesus Christ. None of these people have read the books.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:39.560
Oh yeah, the books even more so. Like, you're lucky if they've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the Hobbit trilogy. You're even more lucky if they've read the books.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:46.560
Amazon had an opportunity here to take over the Lord of the Rings, because they're already doing it. They're already redefining the Lord of the Rings.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:50.560
They're already rewriting the story. They're already making shit out of whole cloth.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.560
They have an opportunity here to just take it, and own it forever.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:06.560
But they hired two fucking randoms off the goddamn street. I mean, they must give amazing blowjobs is the only explanation I can possibly posit.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:12.560
You know what's interesting? They're doing exactly what Disney did to, like, the old Grimm's tales and stuff like that.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:27.560
Where they're basically taking these ideas, because in the intellectual property sphere, if you take something that's in the, what do you call it, the free space, public domain, and you redefine it, and you make it your own, you can monetise it.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:37.560
I mean, they do that with Conan all the time. The Conan video games that are coming out lately are a direct result of that, because Conan's in the public domain, if I'm 100% correct there, which I'm pretty sure it is.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.560
Right now Winnie the Pooh is in the public domain now too.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:46.560
Yep, so it means you can go and you can turn it into your own stuff, and then you can actually monetise it.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:09:00.560
So technically, yes. What they're going to do is what Disney did. They're going to take those public domain ideas, and what they're going to try to do is warp it and twist it enough for the newer generations, by changing the lore and making it their own, that it will splinter as its own identity.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:19.560
Yes. Now granted, there's a little bit of a difference here, because what Disney did was not take public domain. Disney took the things during a time when copyright basically didn't exist, and they changed it just enough to not make it the same thing, and they trademarked it specifically.

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:29.560
Like, Disney has no trademark over the original fairy tale, but they do have a trademark over their version of the fairy tale.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:40.560
It was a clever distinction, which everybody even at the time saw was predatory, but there was no legal framework to stop them, and so, voila.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:48.560
Whereas now, if you try to make a Snow White story, oh, you best believe there will be some mouse-haired lawyers under your door.

01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:54.560
The problem with that is that the IP is actually enforced now, because it's been established under Disney.

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:57.560
Yes, it's enforced by a company.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:03.560
Wait, so you can't make a story about Snow White, even though it's like...

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.560
You can technically do it in the fairy-use sense, but you can't monetize it or stuff like that.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:20.560
What if you just don't use Disney design? The story of Snow White predates Disney.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:23.560
There have been people that do that.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.560
Like, the Alice games by American McGee, they didn't run afoul of Disney at all.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.560
I'm not familiar with those.

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:40.560
You need to make it so substantially different that it is obviously different.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:46.560
And even then, you are running a certain amount of risk. You are running a certain amount of gambit.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.560
I just think American McGee might have run into some problem if he made Alice Blonde.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:11:01.560
And the thing is, American McGee's Alice revamps the character, the setting, the story, everything.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.560
It has virtually nothing to do with Alice anymore beyond the generalized aesthetics of Wonderland.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.560
Yeah, that's true. They made it into Tim Burton's Wonderland, almost.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:22.560
You need to be able to hold out the two products, and then you need to clearly be like, this is not the same as this.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:30.560
Listen, though, listen. There's some quality hentai out there of American McGee's Alice getting with Disney's Alice.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:33.560
My God, the merger's happening.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:40.560
There was a point where this show seemed like it might have been good, but then they just dropped the ball so hard.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.560
That just makes no sense to even somebody who isn't particularly familiar with the lore.

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.560
This show tries way too hard to explain everything of these big events that happened.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:59.560
There's no real reason for us to really need to see it, but then the show just goes out of its way to be like,

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:04.560
Oh, look, look at the thing. Remember in the movies or the books?

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:12.560
Well, this is how the sausage is made, and you're left with the same sort of disgust.

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:20.560
I do like that it kept people guessing with the wizard thing. Maybe they did that thing a bit way too hard, though.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560
You liked that?

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:36.560
No, I liked a little bit how the wizard was behaving and stuff. I thought it was pretty funny, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:47.560
I also feel like they definitely introduced a bit too much and not spent enough time in places where they should have spent just to develop the more important aspects of the show.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:58.560
Yeah, you know what I've realized about this? So I think we're all kind of in agreement that there's like a skeleton of a story that could have been good had they actually done it competently here.

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:10.560
I think what they're banking on is that like in 25 years after the show is done, and the zoomers are like middle aged, looking back with nostalgia goggles,

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.560
haven't seen the show since it first came out, they're going to think, oh, man, that was a good show.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:22.560
You know, the seduction of Galadriel by Halbrand. Man, that was that that was really cool back in the day.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:30.560
You know, oh, you had that neat scene where like the the wizard, he was he was bumbling around because he's like a newborn in an adult's body.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:38.560
And like he he has to hang out with the very innocent Harfoot's like, oh, that was like there was some cool character interaction there.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.560
And they're going to like be remembering a completely different show than the actual show that we just watched.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.560
You're thinking it'll get the the Star Wars prequels kind of treatment.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:14:07.560
But yeah, I don't think so. Because the thing is, if you rewatch the Star Wars prequels, they actually do have all of the setup required to deliver Palpatine is actually a pretty fucking conniving and shrewd political coup maker, you know.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:17.560
All of the steps required to tell that story is there. They should have focused a lot more on it and they should have made a lot more out of it.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:30.560
But here, the ingredients for Halbrand's seduction of Galadriel basically doesn't exist because he wasn't trying to seduce her up until the point where he was.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:38.560
Like there was really no point previously where he was actively flirting with her or trying. Like suddenly it's like, be my queen.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:46.560
What? This wasn't for if they had if they had had an actual romantic relationships previously.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:54.560
OK, but they haven't. Like at what point previously have Halbrand and Galadriel interacted in that way?

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:59.560
Like the closest we get is them being sassy at one another occasionally.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.560
There was that one scene, I think after the fight, and they were both sitting down on the logs.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:16.560
And they kind of like had a weird look where she said, I felt it too. That was I think a couple episodes ago. That was it. It was one scene.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:19.560
I don't even remember that fucking scene.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:29.560
There were a couple scenes throughout the show that they tried to allude to the fact that they were kind of liking each other in a way, but they never really went far with it.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:39.560
And they also never really did much with it other than they kept doing it. They planted the seeds for it, but they weren't like doing a really good job building it up.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:49.560
Now, I do agree that that's what the showrunners think that they have done, because they've literally said so in interviews like 20 years. People totally love this. I don't think so.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:16:00.560
I think in 20 years nobody will even remember that this was a thing. Or if they do, they'll just be like, remember when Amazon did something really stupid and it destroyed their studio? Yeah.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:02.560
I remember.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:11.560
There's a lot of epics that have come out, you know, in terms of TV shows and movies. Lord of the Rings, pretty epic.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:17.560
Harry Potter, I think, qualifies as something that people will still rewatch 10, 20, 50 years down the road.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:28.560
You know, there's a lot of these shows and a lot of these stories, you know, the original Game of Thrones in the last season, but you know, there's this stuff that will stand the test of time.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Stuff that you could dig up years and years and years later. People will still watch and be like, that was good. Maybe a little bit dated, you know.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.560
I recently rewatched the original Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's slightly dated, but you know what? It's still really, really good.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:55.560
This show, I think, will be forgotten about. No one watches it in 20 years. No one gives a fuck. No one's going back to their old DVD box sets or whatever. This show will just be gone.

01:16:56.560 --> 01:17:01.560
If it will be remembered at all, it will be remembered as Amazon's epic failure.

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:15.560
Yes. It will be remembered for that $5 billion price tag, where they just burnt a giant pile of money like the Joker. What a waste of time this was. God damn it.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.560
I don't know what you were expecting.
