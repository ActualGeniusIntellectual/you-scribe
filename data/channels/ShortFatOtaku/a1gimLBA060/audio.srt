1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Cibs is taking off as a full-time streamer and is now developing a video game.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Taking off?

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
That's what you're talking about.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,480
Flying away.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,480
He's like, no, come back!

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,480
No, come back!

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,760
Alright, Cibs, I have to sabotage you.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,760
See, I didn't think if I could do the full stream full-time and make it full streaming,

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,800
but it turns out I can, and apparently grow.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,520
I don't know why I didn't do the zoom.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:37,160
The only thing holding me back at this point is my inability to work steadily.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,680
Is your inability to develop a worth-gethic?

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
That's correct, though.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,560
Because, uh, well, like, if I put out videos every day for a few weeks, my channel, like,

15
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,360
the algorithm revs up and my channel just goes wild, I can put out anything I want.

16
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Right now, I'm suffering from fucking allergies.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
You know what?

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,960
When I was growing up, I never had allergies.

19
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
Ever.

20
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,960
Right?

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,480
Spring, fall, didn't matter.

22
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,360
But now that I'm in my 30s, holy shit, I feel like I'm shutting down for weeks at a time.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,960
My head is just swollen up, and I can't breathe, and I can't think, and I'm just like, ughhh.

24
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,080
Over the last 30 days, Dev has published 16 videos.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
That's your issue.

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,880
You only publish videos half the day.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,880
You need to do more work, Dev.

28
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,360
Yes, I know.

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,240
But when my head is like this, I can't write anything, I can barely think.

30
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,440
Who cares about writing things, Dev?

31
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
Spring!

32
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
No!

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,560
No, I have to- Listen, if I just put out shit, no one's gonna like it.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,760
I gotta actually think about the videos that I do.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:49,360
The past three days has just been me, like, holding my head, trying to get a thought together

36
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,320
in it, completely fucking failing, you know, popping Benadryl, trying to, like, fucking

37
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
get awake.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,440
Jesus, I hate fucking allergies.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
I hate them.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,440
If Tofflebest could have behaved like you, he would have died of cancer.

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,440
Wait.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,240
He did, which means sorry, Dev.

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,960
I guess I'm on my way out.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,020
Don't make the joke about it either, you'll get it.

45
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:17,680
That's how it happens, when you joke about it.

46
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
It's very tragic.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,640
I would never think about joking about it.

48
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,200
I'm just hoping that I'll be fit for thinking and writing again.

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,520
Come tomorrow, because I feel like I'm coming to the end of it.

50
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Christ.

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,800
You're still sick?

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,840
Not sick, I have allergies right now.

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Okay.

54
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,560
The fall is happening.

55
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,560
All the leaves are coming down.

56
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
Wrong culture.

57
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,200
Being sick and then going on a trip and then having allergies, I've missed out on, like,

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,120
two weeks worth of news cycles.

59
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Fuck.

60
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Better.

61
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Loser.

62
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Goddamnit.

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
Fuck you.

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Sounds like a skill issue.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
A skill issue?

66
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,280
Speaking of low fucking standards, Dev, I'm shitting on Google Stadia.

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Fucking hell, Dev.

68
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,280
Jesus Christ, Dev.

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,440
You're talking about low hanging fucking fruit.

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
Jesus Christ.

72
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,960
Hey, listen, that was a decent video that I made.

73
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
Jesus Christ, Dev.

74
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:18,040
I saved up links since 2019 to compile a little mini history of the stadia from, like, announcement

75
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,360
to launch to ending, and I put it all into a nice little 12-minute package, you know?

76
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,760
That was a decent little video.

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
I stand by it.

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,800
It could have been a two-minute video, Dev.

79
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,880
Um, Google Stadia sucks.

80
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,080
It was always gonna suck.

81
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
Well, yeah, of course.

82
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,680
Goodbye.

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
But I wanted to have details.

84
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,000
I wanted to have deep lore.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
This is why you failed, Dev.

86
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,140
Why?

87
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,360
This is why your last video was three days ago, not one day ago.

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,240
No, my last video three days ago, because I've been lying in head with it.

89
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,200
I've been lying in my bed with an inflated head.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,400
I want to point out that this series that I do here with you guys, my friends, this

91
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,320
is easily the least watched thing on my channel.

92
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:12,560
It's probably tanking my channel in the algorithm, but I don't care, because I have fun doing it.

93
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,600
We're still gonna watch some garbage show after this one's done.

94
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,440
This kind of series, what this does is this is for your core audience, because your core

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,080
audience that are there for you will watch this.

96
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
Yeah.

97
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Yeah.

98
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,160
It strengthens your core audience, so it's worth doing and investing.

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,760
And I promise you, I need a strengthened core, that's for sure.

100
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,760
Enough nonsense.

101
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,220
We're gonna get to it.

102
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,220
Let's go.

103
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,220
Press the button.

104
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Before...

105
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,560
No, not yet, Kibs.

106
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Impatient Kibs.

107
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,960
As always, there's a few things to discuss real quick.

108
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,520
So we probably should have talked about this last week, but it kind of flew over my head.

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Did you all see this where the Amazon analyst said that he fell asleep watching Rings of

110
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Power?

111
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,440
No.

112
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
No.

113
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,440
I have not.

114
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Didn't pay him enough.

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Yeah.

116
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,160
So he basically, there's a guy who is hired to like watch the show and he fell asleep

117
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
during it.

118
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
It's like, oh, well.

119
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,200
And yeah, Amazon is actually quite worried about the show, about how much of a bust that

120
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
it is.

121
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,960
To the point that they're finally slicing those disgusting Twitch streamers' salaries.

122
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Fuck those people.

123
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Hey, I'm one of those people.

124
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,960
Yeah, me too.

125
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,960
How dare you?

126
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,960
How dare you?

127
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Like I'm saying.

128
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
How fucking dare you?

129
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Where's my paycheck?

130
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah, Kibs, you stream on Twitch too!

131
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Oh, yeah, I do get a paycheck from him.

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Yay.

133
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Not anymore, you don't.

134
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaking of streamers though, Arch, do you guys remember the Rings of Power superfans?

135
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Yes.

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Think back, think back, we're talking like six months ago, Amazon hired three influencers,

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,560
specifically influencers.

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,600
The fellowship of influencers.

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,820
To come in and talk about how good the Rings of Power looked like it was going to be after

140
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,000
that first trailer dropped.

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,480
With absolutely no gun pointed behind your heads.

142
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,040
Wasn't a gun, it was a giant fat paycheck.

143
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,640
Every time I was like, okay, take a breath, something new would happen and it was, huh,

144
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
huh, huh.

145
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
It's middle earth, it's never peace, right?

146
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
Like Sauron is hot.

147
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,560
I feel like people will be like, I can fix him.

148
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,040
Middle earth had like a club.

149
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,680
Yo, this tune is banking.

150
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,080
Awestruck, mystified and scatstruck.

151
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Wow.

152
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,080
So I decided to look them up because they're, you know, they, they are influencers on YouTube

153
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,400
and like, I think one of them has a couple hundred thousand subs or something like, I

154
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,240
think maybe one of them was like primarily a TikToker, I don't know.

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,420
These three influencers who were paid so much to come on and promote the Lord of the Rings,

156
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,840
the Rings of Power.

157
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,280
Since that promotion all those months ago and throughout the entire run of the show,

158
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,920
they have not said a single fucking thing about it.

159
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Isn't that funny?

160
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Because they were never interested.

161
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,720
You know what makes me mad about this is, there are actually dedicated Lord of the Rings

162
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,640
YouTubers out there that talk about the lore, that talk about the games.

163
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,040
They're actually a Lord of the Rings YouTubing community or content creator community.

164
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,520
Why did they reach out to them?

165
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,120
Why didn't they reach out?

166
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Okay, Kyle.

167
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,000
I know you're very, very retarded.

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You idiot.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let me lay this out for you.

170
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Quit being literal.

171
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know what I mean?

172
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,720
I already know what I mean, but I'm pointing it out.

173
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,360
It's because they wanted out of it.

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,400
Like, that's the same reason why they haven't talked about it.

175
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,480
This was a fucking ad.

176
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,180
It came out yesterday that Rings of Power has been slipping massively in the ratings.

177
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,880
So has House of the Dragon, but not nearly as much.

178
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,840
And that, funnily enough, Cobra Kai has overtaken both of them.

179
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,480
Like Cobra Kai was actually not bad.

180
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,440
Like, granted, it's cliched as fuck.

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,920
It is a stupid, stupid goddamn show.

182
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
And I hate so much about it.

183
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Yeah, exactly.

184
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
That's the thing.

185
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
It's supposed to be.

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,000
Like, it fully embraces the fact that it's supposed to be a very retarded show.

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,180
It's just funny to see that this is basically how Rings of Power has been tumbling over

188
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,560
the course of these past eight weeks.

189
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,960
The thing is, that is the great failure of the Rings of Power.

190
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,520
This is how you know that it is an absolute failure.

191
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,000
The Rings of Power has managed to achieve what George R. R. Martin always wanted.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,620
To be better than Tolkien.

193
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,440
And he's finally done it.

194
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,960
He has a show that's better than a Lord of the Rings show.

195
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,240
Not only the normies, but even the people who are themselves ideologically captured.

196
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,520
They're turning on this.

197
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,360
So on Polygon, the Rings of Power is holding Galadriel back.

198
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,600
Amazon's show hasn't earned the elf warrior's emotional journey.

199
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,680
So like, even, even, you know, Polygon's a shit website run by shit people.

200
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,720
But even they are seeing that, yeah, this is actually really bad.

201
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,720
This is actually a really bad show.

202
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,480
And you see another one like this.

203
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,480
It's time to admit that Rings of Power is just fan fiction.

204
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Everyone, even people who are, let's say, politically aligned to see this show succeed.

205
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Even they are saying, no, it's a failure.

206
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,680
Well, two reasons.

207
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,600
One, their position is by now thoroughly indefensible.

208
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Like episode seven is one of the worst pieces of television ever fucking created from virtually

209
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,640
every single standpoint.

210
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,080
And so it is simply far more profitable to attack it.

211
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,120
Besides, it's almost over and Amazon payscheque isn't coming.

212
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,580
There's no reason not to.

213
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:24,120
And two, to the Rings of Power's credit, limited but maybe, it has not been particularly woke.

214
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,120
It hasn't been banging the drum in the actual story.

215
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,880
It did so in casting, sure as hell.

216
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,740
But in the end, in the actual story, it's, well, it hasn't been political.

217
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,120
It's just been shit.

218
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Yep.

219
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Oh, I guess one last thing before we start, since I don't know if, I don't know if you

220
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,040
mentioned it during the recording or before I turned it on or whatever.

221
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,600
My head's not exactly in there, right?

222
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,000
It's I'm currently floating away on on medication.

223
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,520
But Taft isn't here with us.

224
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
She she's she's not feeling well.

225
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
R.I.P.

226
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Hopefully, she'll be back for the next show.

227
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,200
But this is the finale.

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
She's dead.

229
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
She's dead.

230
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
OK.

231
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Not joking.

232
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
This is it, Kibbs.

233
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,040
The final time you get to press play, unless you want to watch season two of this thing.

234
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
You insist.

235
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,040
It's two years away.

236
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Look, it's Amazon.

237
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Oh, my God.

238
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
Wow.

239
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
It's a little smiley face.

240
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,680
I hit the recap button.

241
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,520
Look, it's poppies.

242
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,960
We're in Afghanistan.

243
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
It's raining, actually.

244
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,400
It rains in Afghanistan.

245
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
No, it doesn't.

246
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
Never.

247
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
It does.

248
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
So what do you do, Kibbs?

249
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
It doesn't.

250
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,300
That was a neat establishing job.

251
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,120
That's probably the best part of this whole episode, I bet.

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
Came humping a rock for two seconds.

253
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,840
Yeah, basically.

254
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Listen, the bar's low.

255
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,120
You know, I always feel bad for actors like this.

256
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,080
You know, they're given a soaked piece of cloth and just be like, go huddle in the rain

257
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
for five minutes.

258
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Like, oh, I don't feel that bad considering how much they're paid.

259
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,720
And five minutes is like five hours because, you know, they have to get all the shots.

260
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Like 50 takes.

261
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
Yeah.

262
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,720
No, wait.

263
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,720
It's just an apple.

264
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,680
That's a remarkably neat look.

265
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
You cut out there, Kibbs.

266
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
What'd you say?

267
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
I said, how the fuck did the apple get over there?

268
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,280
It's like 30 feet away.

269
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
It rolled, man.

270
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
It rolled down the hill.

271
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,120
You ever like, you're at your desk and you drop something and then you look down and

272
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,080
it's like across the room and out into the hallway and you're like, fuck.

273
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Yeah, what happens?

274
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,520
Oh, look, it's an apparition.

275
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
See?

276
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I called it.

277
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,160
It was an apparition.

278
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
It's evil.

279
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Kill it.

280
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,080
It's actually that short haired, white haired girl.

281
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Yep.

282
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
Yeah.

283
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:57,480
A real slim shady ha-doom-doom-doom.

284
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,840
Would you like an apple?

285
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,160
Nobody bad has ever offered an apple.

286
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,080
I really hate the armor of that chick in particular.

287
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:20,480
So, somebody owes me a blowjob, Dev.

288
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Down.

289
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
No.

290
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Hold on.

291
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Down, Dev.

292
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Come now.

293
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,360
Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,520
I was the one who-

295
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
Down, Dev.

296
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
No, no.

297
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,560
I was the one who bet Mauler that this would be-

298
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,520
Yeah, but you were doubting.

299
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,160
I was never doubting.

300
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,400
I was always strong in my faith.

301
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I don't know.

302
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,280
You were on the Gandalf train a little bit, weren't you?

303
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
God no.

304
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,320
I didn't think it was Gandalf, but I thought I could have sworn this motherfucker would-

305
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
like that would be too obvious.

306
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,480
Well, Kyle, you two are going to have to get down on your fucking knees.

307
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
No, no.

308
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
Well, the most interesting plot has been revealed.

309
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
I don't want to watch anymore.

310
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Oh, no.

311
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Yes, quit.

312
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,160
No, no, no.

313
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,600
Like I said at the beginning, this is why the hobbits are remarkably resistant to the

314
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
rings of power.

315
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,240
That's so stupid, though, because Sauron is like, I feel bad for that one fucking little

316
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
like hobbit thing I did-

317
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
Wait a second.

318
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
Wait, Arch-

319
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
But the Harfoot's not even hobbits.

320
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,600
Arch, didn't I say that back then?

321
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
No.

322
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
Are you taking all my good takes for yourself?

323
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Son of a slut.

324
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,600
You're stealing my takes.

325
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
Yep, Dev agreed.

326
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
Horse shit, Dev Rudy.

327
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Hold on.

328
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Lilith, Lilith, you got to break the tie here.

329
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Come on, Lilith.

330
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
We already broke the tie.

331
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,160
Dev's right.

332
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,160
I'm pretty sure you said something along the lines, Dev.

333
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
Yeah, he said something after I said it.

334
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,360
He parroted me, like the little pig that he is.

335
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I think Arch is a parroter.

336
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,800
Wait, can't the elves just mine it themselves?

337
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,240
You guys know how to mine, right?

338
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
The land belongs to the dorists.

339
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
No.

340
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
How could we possibly match the powers that rule?

341
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Oh, simple.

342
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
We just make rings.

343
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Oh, then my guy's going to make the rings of power with this?

344
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Are you serious?

345
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes.

346
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Wait, were the rings of power made out of mithril?

347
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
No.

348
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
No.

349
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Oh.

350
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
They were cracked with magic.

351
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,680
Don't explain to us how the rings are made.

352
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Don't explain to us how the rings are made.

353
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
I can't explain.

354
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,680
It's in the fucking title you much much.

355
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,680
Ah.

356
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,680
Okay, so-

357
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Ah.

358
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,800
Okay, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold, hold.

359
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,000
How Bran seems fucked.

360
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,920
How far did she just ride?

361
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,160
A few hundred miles at least.

362
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,080
They just galloped all the way to elf capital.

363
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Was it Lindon?

364
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Six days.

365
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,120
They have to get there by ship?

366
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,560
He survived a week on a horseback.

367
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,760
There's no way they traveled that far in six days.

368
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,160
Oh, fuck me gently.

369
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,760
Listen, he's just a gigachad, all right?

370
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,840
I'm pretty sure that's over 600 miles, or 300 at the very least.

371
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,400
They just fell that way just for bed in a hospital bed.

372
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Yep.

373
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,280
Let me open up a map of Middle-earth on the second page.

374
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,840
Couldn't they have just moved the healers over there?

375
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,840
They just fast-traveled.

376
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,840
They just fast-traveled.

377
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,000
There are no enemies nearby.

378
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
Oh, God, she's right.

379
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Of course she is.

380
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,560
She was always right, Dev.

381
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
No.

382
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
Whatever the fuck that is.

383
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Dev.

384
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Dev.

385
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Okay, Lindon, 200.

386
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,560
400.

387
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
600.

388
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Dude, that's like-

389
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,440
That's like almost 1,000 miles, if I'm doing that correctly.

390
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,840
That's a fast horse.

391
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,400
There's no way.

392
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
No way.

393
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Yeah, I know.

394
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,560
We watched you swim for, like, a whole fucking episode, and it was retarded.

395
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
It was really bad.

396
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,280
You know what upsets me?

397
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,520
That style of makeup that makes their pores look enormous.

398
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,560
It just kind of makes me feel like I'm developing tryctophobia.

399
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
Sweet.

400
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Their faces look very holey now.

401
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
Yeah, don't they?

402
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Like it's that lighting, that makeup style, and they just look like they're bumpy.

403
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Well, they are ascended beings, Kibbs.

404
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,560
Make it cold so their pores close.

405
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
But you don't get it, do you?

406
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
I don't care about getting it.

407
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
I don't want their pores to close.

408
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I remember when in movies where Galadriel just looked completely flawless and, like, shiny

409
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,560
because that's what elves are supposed to be.

410
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
That's just photoshopped.

411
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,560
I mean, that's the point, though.

412
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Unrealistic beauty standards.

413
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
All of Galadriel's OnlyFans pics are photoshopped.

414
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
What is this place?

415
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
This is my forge.

416
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
What's the workshop of Celebrimbor?

417
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
The Thor arches are curved.

418
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
Come on, now.

419
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Now, okay.

420
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Hammer home how right I was.

421
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,560
Let's add in a time differential as well.

422
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Let's make Halbrand Sauron, too.

423
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Oh, God.

424
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Because now he's in the forge.

425
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Now he's like, oh, but maybe I could make a ring that could, like, yes, maybe.

426
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,560
The master I apprenticed to used to speak of the wonders of your craft.

427
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,560
See?

428
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
He's a smith, too.

429
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
Oh.

430
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Oh, my God.

431
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,560
So they're going to have two Saurons.

432
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Wait, you know what it'll be?

433
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
It'll be like...

434
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Oh, no.

435
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,560
No, I feel like the Hobo could be a red herring.

436
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
Maybe.

437
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
It still is a red herring.

438
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,560
Or they could be, like, both Saurons, and you've got to combine them into, like, one

439
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
guy, like a fusion dance.

440
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Oh, God, he's splintered his soul or something?

441
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
Yeah.

442
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,560
I'm super smart, by the way.

443
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Somebody needs to be, once again, begging Arch for forgiveness and calling him smart.

444
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
He's fucking Sauron, too.

445
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
Arch is wrong again.

446
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Listen to me.

447
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm Halbrand.

448
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I come from Mordor.

449
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,560
I know everything about magic, metal, and shit, which you, the ten thousand year old

450
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,560
smith, would never know.

451
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Retard.

452
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
A gift.

453
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Sticky Sauron, too.

454
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
A gift.

455
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
They're all Sauron.

456
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Everyone's Sauron.

457
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,560
I'm a Sauron.

458
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,560
It's like Battlestar Galactica.

459
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
We're all Sirens.

460
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
We're all Sirens.

461
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,560
I hear online that this Phaseron guy is also Sauron.

462
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
This, like, marks here.

463
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,560
No, Phaseron is not Sauron.

464
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,560
He was manipulated by Sauron.

465
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Okay, so who's gonna start talking to him and manipulating him?

466
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Well, I'm sure Halbrand will probably pop him again soon or something.

467
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,560
Or, I think they've just dropped the entire Numenor plotline.

468
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Maybe she's Sauron, too.

469
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Their understanding of art is really advanced.

470
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,560
And, now they've got paper instead of that fucking papyrus shit they were having earlier.

471
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,560
I want to see mommy milkers one more time before I go.

472
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,560
Let me, let me feel with my hand.

473
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:09,560
By the way, for all of the flaws of House of the Dragon, they did a much better Dying

474
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,560
King set of scenes than this show did.

475
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
You're mistaken.

476
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Wait, what?

477
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
What do you mean next up?

478
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Next up, fuck off.

479
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Sorry, that's too pop up.

480
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
Sink, but yes.

481
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I mean, this king is about dying.

482
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,560
I don't make this mistake, too, in paratrauma.

483
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Like, our ship is falling.

484
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
No, Kyle, it's sinking.

485
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,560
The king!

486
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,560
Help!

487
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
Well, it falls to the ocean bottom.

488
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Oh my god, the rings of power.

489
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Is he gonna die in time?

490
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,560
Wait, he vanished.

491
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,560
Uh oh.

492
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,560
Maybe he's Sauron.

493
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,560
He got spry all of a sudden.

494
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,560
This is a rather random plot point.

495
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
This is.

496
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,560
I feel like this only exists so we have some reason to care about whomever this is.

497
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Yeah, because to be honest, besides her boobs, there's not much else to her.

498
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
And her tits could be bigger.

499
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Yeah, they could use a-

500
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,560
They could CGI those up a little bit.

501
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Well, you don't want it too big.

502
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Otherwise they'd get droopy and say-

503
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I don't know.

504
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
They could be larger.

505
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
What manner of object?

506
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
A ring!

507
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
He's a cringe.

508
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
This is so stupid.

509
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
God help her.

510
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
Yeah, how rings work.

511
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,560
All that power upon the brow of one being.

512
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
You've just ruined the mystery.

513
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Suggestions were but the key that unlocked the dam.

514
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
We are on the cusp of-

515
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Jesus, they really want to-

516
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Okay.

517
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Strength but of spirit.

518
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,560
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

519
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Galadriel's gaydar is tingling.

520
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Wait, hold on.

521
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,560
Are you a traitorous faggot?

522
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,560
Are you Sauron?

523
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
Again, the fucking story telling.

524
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Do we need a rebellious moment here?

525
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Do we need the scene where he goes like,

526
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
No, I'll do it anyways.

527
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Do we need that?

528
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Why the fuck do we need that?

529
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,560
We need more drama to keep the viewers engaged.

530
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Drama no matter what.

531
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,560
That's probably what the school taught them.

532
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
Wherever writing school they came from.

533
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
If they went to school.

534
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Oh my god, the fucking mithril's making him do it.

535
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
Does it matter?

536
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
Of course.

537
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Oh wait, so wait.

538
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
What does it matter?

539
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,560
All mithril has the same corrupting powers?

540
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
That'd be ridiculous.

541
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
At least Frodo was wearing a shirt of that shit.

542
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I mowed that much.

543
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:06,560
No, no, I think they're suggesting that Halbrand somehow talked him into it.

544
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,560
The problem is, all of this bullshit drama is replacing the drama we should have.

545
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Which is Halbrand very, very, very slowly talking the elves into this idea.

546
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Like suggesting, hinting.

547
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
Instead he just walks in there and goes like,

548
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Why have you made it into a ring?

549
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,560
Like, oh, brilliant.

550
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,560
I love how Halbrand's just a part of the smithing crew now.

551
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
Like, you told me something incredibly obvious.

552
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Be my apprentice.

553
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Yeah, we needed like three scenes.

554
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,560
Three or four scenes of him talking to that guy and like getting him warmed up to it.

555
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Not just, oh, he's here now.

556
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:54,560
What gets to me is just like, until now we've never even heard of Halbrand being like a ring maker or metal worker much.

557
00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:01,560
We saw him like one scene doing it in, um, fuck, what was it called?

558
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,560
The island.

559
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,560
He's fucked around with the foraging like twice.

560
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Yeah, I can see how the...

561
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Okay, maybe I just didn't remember.

562
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,560
But like, I don't think it was like ever stated that he was like a super expert at it, so.

563
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
Just that he wanted to do it.

564
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,560
Well, so far he's been a traveler, a sailor, a smith, a king.

565
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Someone like me.

566
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Yeah.

567
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Yeah.

568
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Someone like me, Sauron.

569
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Right next to you, Galadriel.

570
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
You've been looking for me for so long.

571
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
She saved Sauron's life.

572
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,560
No.

573
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Yes.

574
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
He believed in me.

575
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Oh my god, that's true, she did.

576
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
He pushed me to heights that no one else could have.

577
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
See, oh my god.

578
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,560
This, in a better show, this would have been an excellent fucking scene.

579
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:17,560
See, if this was in a show where you never suspected who this guy was, this would have been a fucking good scene.

580
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
But it isn't, it's in the rings of power.

581
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:25,560
It would be one of those scenes where like on your second watch through you could see all the little things.

582
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Yep, and he's like, you believed in me, you pushed me, you made me stronger.

583
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,560
Like that would have been a fucking chill scene if it wasn't in the rings of power.

584
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,560
See, they're trying to fucking do the two thing.

585
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Me stars!

586
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
I don't think that's how that works.

587
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,560
You fell from the stars, yet you are greater than they.

588
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Why is everyone echoing?

589
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Because it's dramatic.

590
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,560
In time he will learn to control his powers, for now bind him.

591
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,560
They're messing up my hair.

592
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Oh look, it's a little concept on YouTube.

593
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
It's a horror flute.

594
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Oh god, I hate the horror flute so much.

595
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Totally bad.

596
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Now's our chance.

597
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
To get what, fucking killed?

598
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,560
Yeah, well I expected to against him.

599
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
They're just gonna set you on fire.

600
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,560
They're harfoots, they've got guerilla memes, okay.

601
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,560
I'm afraid they're like little Vietnamese people.

602
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,560
See like the Ewoks, like they'll swing logs down.

603
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:10,560
When the trees start speaking harfoot, oh they just, they just left, they just left him okay, nevermind.

604
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Well they didn't, then we're gonna get out.

605
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
The third person is gonna show up at the last second.

606
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Gotcha kids.

607
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,560
She's gonna show off, off screen.

608
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Watch this.

609
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,560
Oh no, the third person is the bad bitch.

610
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Thank you, that was kind of a clever double.

611
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,560
It doesn't make sense because the harfoots were looking straight at them when they did this, but details, details.

612
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Run.

613
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
Oh no, a tiny harfoot is uh.

614
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,560
Oh no.

615
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Nice.

616
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,560
Yes.

617
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Goodbye.

618
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
Thank you.

619
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Now twist the knife, make sure.

620
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
No, he fell off screen, he's still alive, no.

621
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
That's unfortunate, he is still alive.

622
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Fuck.

623
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Well that was a good choice.

624
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,560
Black man dies, archers.

625
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Actually you know what?

626
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,560
So on Andor this week, of the six main characters there was two black guys and they killed them both.

627
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
All the black people are dying on TV right now.

628
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,560
But tragically both lesbians survived.

629
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
Hey listen, they're both kind of cute.

630
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
I don't know about that.

631
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,560
I do.

632
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,560
Deadeye force push.

633
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
I'm sorry.

634
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
How is that troll sticking to your head there woman?

635
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
It's a bit weird.

636
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Wait, how is Sauron losing the mage fight?

637
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
I just noticed her staff is the eye.

638
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Look at her staff, it's the eye.

639
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Well yes Dev.

640
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,560
Are you some kind of dev?

641
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,560
Oh cool, Batarangs.

642
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
Okay, that was pretty funny.

643
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,560
That was good.

644
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,560
The little lottery.

645
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Batarangs.

646
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
That's why there's just a fuck you master.

647
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Yeah, exactly.

648
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
If I were Sauron, I'd say that's a good choice.

649
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:36,560
If I were Sauron, I'd just be like, you're fired.

650
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Look at the stoners.

651
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Defeated by nuts and berries.

652
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Oh, she can't detect them anymore.

653
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,560
I'm really mad, I'm going to burn all of you.

654
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
They're hidden behind leaves, everybody.

655
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Uh oh.

656
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Couldn't she just light everything on fire like she did before?

657
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
Yep, that's what she needed to do.

658
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Oh shit.

659
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Come on, please kill at least one of the harplets, I pray.

660
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
One of them at least.

661
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
Nah, they got too much plot armor.

662
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Oh no, my harpits, they're burning.

663
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,560
This is just a normal California summer, after a gender reveal party.

664
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:44,560
See, now, if anything, I'm slowly growing more skeptical, because they're laying on the herring a little bit too thick right now.

665
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
It's very thick.

666
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
This is the problem though.

667
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
It reveals that this is how Gandalf was formed.

668
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:58,560
The issue is, they're double layering the story so thick that neither outcome makes sense anymore.

669
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah.

670
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,560
My $20 is in limbo.

671
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Wait, is he just surviving?

672
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
After getting stabbed in the gut?

673
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,560
I mean, you fuckers still have knives, you could just stab them.

674
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
Check with the Batarangs, could throw them.

675
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,560
Suck it! Get on your knees!

676
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
I'm good.

677
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Oh, they're ringwraiths.

678
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Wait, how?

679
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
They can't be ringwraiths.

680
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Oh, personally can be ringwraiths.

681
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
They're moths.

682
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Yeah.

683
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
Barge.

684
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Ooh, that ringwraith style.

685
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
He's Nistar.

686
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Okay, so which wizard is he then?

687
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
Nothing.

688
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
I hope it's the white wizard.

689
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Saruman?

690
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Yep, Saruman.

691
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,560
Before he became a, you know, black-filled wizard.

692
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Oh, thank god he's gonna die.

693
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Oh, he's gonna be saved by magic.

694
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Please, TV show, at least give me this.

695
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
They're gonna.

696
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
You don't think the maid is gonna heal him?

697
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,560
Nope, because he just nodded.

698
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,560
He's like, yep, I'm not healing you.

699
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
He pissed off the priest one too many times in the dungeon.

700
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Oh god, that's quick. He's going fast.

701
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
He's going sitting up?

702
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Yeah.

703
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
And he still, some still say his skeletons are there to this day.

704
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
You know, I'm having fun with this episode.

705
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,560
The thing is, I'm still not even sold that he's a wizard.

706
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Because the problem is, he can't be a wizard from the timeline.

707
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:18,560
And they have doubled back on what he is so many times.

708
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:21,560
He can be, because they're just making shit up at this point.

709
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Oh they are, but the thing is, they've doubled back on this like twelve times now.

710
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,560
From good to evil to evil to good to good to evil.

711
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Keep your guessing, right?

712
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:43,560
What they're doing is, you know, they made the Balrog show up, and the wizard show up, and Mount Doom first erupt.

713
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:50,560
In the same week. And these things did not happen anywhere close to each other in the timeline.

714
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,560
This is very convenient that they all happen all at once, Dev.

715
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,560
The issue is too though, the wizards are out in the third age.

716
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Which means that Amazon literally does not have the rights to the wizards.

717
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Hey wait a second. She's down in the hold of the ship practicing.

718
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:25,560
I mean the implication is that she's practicing being blind in public so that no one knows she's blind.

719
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
That's what it seems like is happening right now.

720
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:33,560
But in the last episode there was that scene of her on the deck of the ship with her blindfold on.

721
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,560
Yes.

722
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Yes, Dev.

723
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,560
Yes, Dev. Yes, it doesn't make sense, Dev. Come here, Dev.

724
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Dev, Dev, Dev.

725
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,560
This is the rings of power in a nutshell right here.

726
00:33:51,560 --> 00:34:01,560
This is why even that theoretically great scene with Halbrand is actually shit, because this is what the show does normally.

727
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Maybe Taftash had the right idea, getting sick and bowing out.

728
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,560
This entire blind plotline is...

729
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:20,560
It feels like one of the two showrunners wrote half of it and the other guy wrote the other half and they never spoke about it.

730
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,560
So one's like, oh she'll be a really strong queen because she'll pretend not to be blind.

731
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
And the other guy's like, well she's blind now, I guess she's got a blindfold.

732
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,560
You gotta make her a demon hunter from Warcraft.

733
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,560
Kibbs gets it, because he's actually playing Warcraft right now, you fucking Blizzard shill traitor.

734
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,560
This episode's actually been the most entertaining. Not for any good reasons, but because it's very funny.

735
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm just very glad that at least one of the Harfords is finally dead.

736
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,560
This is the first time I've enjoyed the show. Like, wow.

737
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,560
I'm just very glad the show's almost fucking over. Are we really doing season two?

738
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:06,560
Yeah, but it's in two years time, so I wouldn't worry about it.

739
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,560
And by then we'll be dead. One of us will have died of old age.

740
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
My bet is on Dev.

741
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
I can't fucking wait.

742
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Time to pretend to not be blind in front of all the people who have seen me with a blindfold.

743
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
No, she has a blindfold.

744
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Alright.

745
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Oh, hi. Oh, Jesus. Alright, well, never mind.

746
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
So, what specifically was she practicing down there?

747
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,560
She was practicing pissing me off.

748
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,560
Black flags, ma'am. You're fucking dead's dead.

749
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Ta-da!

750
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
You're right. Black flags.

751
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,560
I feel bad for the guy who didn't go up to that fucking mountain to do that one.

752
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Just hanging there.

753
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
He's like, Jim, I'm gonna need you to go up there. Like, please, no.

754
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
It's a living.

755
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Man, I would have felt really bad if I knew who the fuck this guy was.

756
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,560
It's Santa.

757
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
If only he had any screen time.

758
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
Staring at him with loving eyes.

759
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Oh, they died.

760
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,560
What the fuck happened?

761
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,560
No, no, this is the elves again.

762
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
They're making the rings and they're fucking up a bit.

763
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
Oh, you idiots.

764
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Oh my god, I thought it was a terrorist attack. Like, they're 9-11 in the Numenor.

765
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
Also, hold the fuck on.

766
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Who puts their smith at the top of a tower?

767
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,560
Thank you.

768
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Galadriel.

769
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,560
Pushing ourselves too high.

770
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
That's it.

771
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Oh god, it is.

772
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Of course it is.

773
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Fucking hell.

774
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
That's it.

775
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
I've got it now.

776
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,560
Why did I think of that?

777
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Drawn or coaxed.

778
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,560
God damn, Galadriel just has to do everything in this show.

779
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Everything inside out.

780
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Yes, because this is how metal works.

781
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Sometimes you gotta pet the metal and then it'll just, you know, bind with other metals.

782
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
That's how this works.

783
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
That's how it's doing a good job.

784
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Here's this thing.

785
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Stroke it gently and then it'll become iron and that's how steel is made.

786
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,560
You whisper gently into the ears of iron and copper and steel.

787
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Armor.

788
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,560
God, I just read something really shocking.

789
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Stupid.

790
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,560
And it rolled away from me because it's on a scroll.

791
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,560
Gasparuni.

792
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Uh oh.

793
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,560
The last man to bear your crest died over a thousand years ago.

794
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
He had no heir.

795
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,560
I read there, he had no heir.

796
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,560
No, on the raft you saved me.

797
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
On the raft, you saved me.

798
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,560
You convinced Myrios to save the men of Middle-earth.

799
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,560
Oh.

800
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Isaron.

801
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,560
The evil music is revealing it to us.

802
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,560
And mine.

803
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Tell me your name.

804
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,560
I have been awake since before the breaking of the first silence.

805
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
And outside.

806
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
I have had many names.

807
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Why would you reveal it here, though?

808
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,560
Again, you know, this should be a good scene, but the acting is fucking up a bit here.

809
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
Like, Letter's actually doing okay.

810
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
But.

811
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
He, like.

812
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
There should have been a bit more of a smile on his face.

813
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,560
He should have been a little bit more sinister.

814
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
They should have shaded him a bit more.

815
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Also.

816
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
He hasn't made the rings yet.

817
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
This isn't when you...

818
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
Oh God, alright.

819
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,560
Well, he's made her into a common as it's fine.

820
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Hello, I'm the brother from episode one.

821
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,560
I've had a grand total of five seconds of screen time, but you should remember me.

822
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,560
He was seeking a power.

823
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Not to destroy Middle Earth.

824
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
But to heal it.

825
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
He's the good guy.

826
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
If it was your fellow elves.

827
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
Why would you say such a thing?

828
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
Damn them CGI tears.

829
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,560
You can't even get the actors to actually cry anymore.

830
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,560
Geez.

831
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,560
Look at me!

832
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,560
Oh, now we're on the ship.

833
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Well, the ship.

834
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,560
You know who I am.

835
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
I am your friend.

836
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,560
I want her to start pulling on the thing again.

837
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,560
He's just gaslighting.

838
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,560
This is like, oh, I'm going to take you to the fantasy world to gaslight you non-stop.

839
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,560
I told you that I had done evil and you did not care.

840
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,560
Because you knew that our past meant nothing.

841
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,560
Weighed against our future.

842
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,560
Wait.

843
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Wait.

844
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,560
So women make him evil?

845
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,560
Someone's actually good.

846
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,560
He got dumped by Galadriel and that's why he turns evil.

847
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
He's an incel.

848
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
I get it now.

849
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,560
That was a forced scene. I didn't like that.

850
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,560
Yeah.

851
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,560
There is, there is fucking meat to this.

852
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
That's what annoys me, but there's no setup.

853
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
And I really,

854
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,560
I fucking hate his actor when it comes to this.

855
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Like he doesn't have that charisma that he really should have here.

856
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,560
That gravitas.

857
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Oh my God.

858
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
Taking that line from the fucking movie.

859
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:47,560
I mean, I think this guy could do it, but they just needed an actual show behind it and not just this nonsense.

860
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
The romance thing is really cringe though, I will say that much.

861
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
I see.

862
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:11,560
I don't mind that because he's the one trying to seduce her and there's no indication that he actually necessarily gives a shit, but he wants her power and she's got him by the walls.

863
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Yeah, that too was just a fuck.

864
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,560
He doesn't look like Sauron because you give him slit eyes. Like this isn't how this works.

865
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Not gonna lie.

866
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,560
This is really dumb.

867
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,560
No, no, no, no, no. This is the cleverest the show has ever been, which is sad.

868
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
Clever for a show, terrible for Lord of the Rings.

869
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
But the thing is, this works.

870
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:51,560
If only it had been constructed better. If only it had been acted better, shot better.

871
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,560
If only it wasn't this.

872
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Like, this is a genuinely fine story point, but very poorly delivered.

873
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:19,560
Oh, Arch, the comments corrected us from last week. Elrond apparently always was a half-elf.

874
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:30,560
Also, wait a second. How does that prove that Elrond's real if that's something that Galadriel knows and Sauron can just take it from her mind?

875
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,560
Can he take it from her mind? Does he have that Jedi power?

876
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,560
Yeah, that's what we've been doing this whole time.

877
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Like, you'd have to ask a question that you didn't know the answer to, but would sound real to you when they gave it to you.

878
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Just tell him.

879
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,560
You are making that promise very difficult to keep.

880
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Very easy. It would not require trust.

881
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Really, bitch? You're gonna just sweep this one under the rug?

882
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Why wouldn't you tell everyone? This was Sauron.

883
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:16,560
She has to be mysterious. She has to be cryptic for no reason.

884
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,560
Three?

885
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,560
I want one. That's why.

886
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Two will divide.

887
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,560
But with three, there is balance.

888
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,560
And we each get one.

889
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,560
There is no sense.

890
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,560
Must be for the elves alone.

891
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,560
Untouched by other hands.

892
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,560
Oh, shit. We've literally rewritten the entire fucking origin of the Rings of Power.

893
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,560
You have potential, Arch.

894
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,560
I need gold and silver.

895
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,560
The most exquisite quality.

896
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,560
I need gold and silver from Valinor.

897
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,560
True creation requires a dagger sacrifice.

898
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,560
Oh, God. Now she can melt that down to cut herself from her brother. Oh, God, that's okay.

899
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,560
Do you remember anything more yet?

900
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:21,560
Fragments.

901
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,560
Oh, look, the Harfoots are settling down to farm like nomadic communities usually do.

902
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,560
This is the origin story as to why the hobbits started to settle.

903
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
It's awful, but you know.

904
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
In your tongue, that means wise one.

905
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Oh.

906
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,560
Wizard.

907
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Yeah.

908
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,560
Arch, you were wrong.

909
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
No, I'm still not admitting it.

910
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,560
You can't. You've been defeated.

911
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,560
I can. I absolutely can, because they've made him good and then evil and then evil and then good again and again.

912
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,560
This is just another part of it.

913
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
So which...

914
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
Because he can't be a wizard. Literally.

915
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,560
There is no way he can be.

916
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Why?

917
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,560
Because the wizard was specifically sent as a response to Sauron.

918
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,560
Yeah.

919
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
And they were sent in the third age.

920
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Sorry, Arch, but that's old lore. It's been changed.

921
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,560
Yeah, give it the time, boomer.

922
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,560
At least we're almost done, I think.

923
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Okay, let's hover over it.

924
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,560
It's like 20 minutes left.

925
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,560
Arch, jump out a window.

926
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,560
I would rather do something else.

927
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,560
The funny parts are over. I'm no longer enjoying this.

928
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,560
I don't.

929
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
I'm quite happy we killed at least one half-foot.

930
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,560
One casualty is a good start.

931
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,560
It's a beginning. We've got a long way to go.

932
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,560
Is he the only named character that's dead?

933
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
In the entire season?

934
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,560
I think so.

935
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,560
Well, the king was named.

936
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,560
Well, but he wasn't a character character.

937
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,560
That's true.

938
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,560
So technically, the black guy dicked a hearse.

939
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,560
Oh, good. So she's only going to follow her story with this star.

940
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:27,560
We're not going to fucking watch the rest of them in season two.

941
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,560
Well, I'm going on an adventure.

942
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,560
Maybe all of the others will be wiped out off-screen.

943
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Hopefully.

944
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:44,560
The best part is, what they've done here is they basically said that it was actually women were the first adventuring hobbits.

945
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,560
Little girl. What the fuck? Where'd she come from?

946
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,560
They just breed real fast.

947
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,560
Jesus Christ.

948
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:00,560
You know, after sex, an acorn pops out of the woman's vagina.

949
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,560
In two or three weeks after planting, it'll just sprout right up.

950
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,560
Ain't no stuff. Not a vagina. That'd be weird.

951
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Like a gross barge. I know it's hard for you.

952
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,560
We're birds has preferences.

953
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:20,560
I feel bad for these poor actors. They were like, oh, that's going to be great for my career.

954
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:22,560
It's going to look great.

955
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
Rest in peace, bro.

956
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:26,560
Like a sign language thing.

957
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,560
I will actually say one good thing about the Harfoot's their music, their aesthetic, their accents.

958
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:37,560
It reminds me a lot of that GameCube game, Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

959
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:39,560
It's the exact same like theming.

960
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,560
Irish. And dirty.

961
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah.

962
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,560
Sick of the Harfoot's now. Kill them all. Move on.

963
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:52,560
They're dirty hair. They're dirty hands. They're dirty faces.

964
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,560
It feels like they've done this, this goodbye scene, like three big hugs now.

965
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:02,560
They kind of have, because there's also different stories where they're doing like goodbye things.

966
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:06,560
I had to get one for every story. We have yet to get one for the black elf.

967
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Or maybe hit the way he's over.

968
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,560
By the way, there's some race mixing going on here and yet all of the children are white. Explain.

969
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
One gene is stronger than the other, apparently.

970
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,560
Oh, no. Fat Sam.

971
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,560
Well, Sam was always kind of fat.

972
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:27,560
Ploppé. Actually, Ploppé would be a better name. Ploppé.

973
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,560
Don't come with. Don't come with.

974
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,560
Why does everyone I love the most always have to go away?

975
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,560
I don't know. It's never happened before, so, you know.

976
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Is she going to come along?

977
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,560
No, please.

978
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
Oh, Ploppé.

979
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:48,560
It sounds like she's, she's not. Okay.

980
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:59,560
See, the whole reason that you had to have Frodo and Sam is, is thematically, is because by the end of the journey when, when Frodo couldn't do it, Sam could do the rest of it.

981
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,560
And he was supposed to be the anchor back to the ordinary world.

982
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
That was the point of their friendship.

983
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,560
Well, it's, Jesus Christ Arch. It's, it's more that like, there's that final...

984
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,560
No, no. He literally was a manservant.

985
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,560
He was, he was. But there was that final scene where Frodo says, there's no veil between me and the Ring of Fire.

986
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:27,560
And he's basically saying that the Ring's influence has made him forget everything good in life and he is absorbed by nihilism.

987
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,560
And Sam had to be that anchor back to what was meaningful in life.

988
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Constantly reminding him about the strawberries and everything else and good in the world.

989
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,560
Yeah. Yeah. But you don't need a Sam character for this kind of journey.

990
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,560
Always follow your nose.

991
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:49,560
Always follow your nose.

992
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,560
God damn it, Arch. How do you know?

993
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:54,560
It's a saying. How do you not know, Dev?

994
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:59,560
It's Gandalf. Fuck me. I hate it.

995
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,560
I love it because Barch is me and he is.

996
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:07,560
Thing is, I'm still not sold on it either.

997
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,560
You will be. Because Sauron was a Maiar as well.

998
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,560
Yeah, but he's a different Maiar. He's almost...

999
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:15,560
No. No, they're not.

1000
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,560
The Maiar or the Maiar?

1001
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,560
On the double fake, it's over, Barch. You lost. You got to have one.

1002
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,560
Maiar or the Maiar?

1003
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,560
I'm going to put Kibbs in my $20.

1004
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,560
Listen, Dev. It was that or defeating Barch?

1005
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:32,560
A worthy sacrifice.

1006
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,560
You know, he really should have removed the blade from that first.

1007
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
That's going to fuck up the composition of something awful.

1008
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:45,560
Yeah, but the implication is that the handle is the gold and the blade is the silver.

1009
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,560
Yep. Dev, do I need to teach you about how soft silver is?

1010
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,560
Oh no, I know. But the show doesn't know. The show doesn't know.

1011
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:59,560
And even then, you wouldn't mix the silver and the fucking gold. That's dumb too.

1012
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:05,560
Well, the idea is they're mixing silver, gold, and mithril to make the magic of the rings.

1013
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,560
Yeah, but they do not mix really, though.

1014
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,560
Hold on, though. Hold on a second.

1015
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:19,560
So, the original story was that they made all the rings. There was nine, five, and three at the same time.

1016
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,560
But also that Sauron made a hidden ring at the same time.

1017
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,560
Yes.

1018
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
But they're already making three right now?

1019
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Yes.

1020
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,560
They're making them at different times now.

1021
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:35,560
That's why we've got to have like five fucking seasons so they can make the rings little by little.

1022
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,560
Just drop that shit in.

1023
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:46,560
This is how you make an alloy right here. You just fucking plump that bitch down there and voila.

1024
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:48,560
It's like a magical...

1025
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,560
Look, it's an eye!

1026
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
Oh my god, it's evil.

1027
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,560
Making cabbage soup.

1028
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,560
There you go. It didn't need pressure, it just needed light stirring.

1029
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,560
Like most metallic alloys.

1030
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:06,560
They got to bend them.

1031
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,560
Oh, that's brilliant. That's actually brilliant.

1032
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,560
I prefer the scene in the movies where there are like five elves wailing on it with hammers.

1033
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,560
Elrond is getting suspicious.

1034
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,560
He's doing his CSI thing.

1035
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,560
That paper would not be legible after this.

1036
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,560
Yeah.

1037
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
It's magic ink. Don't think about it.

1038
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,560
Magic paper.

1039
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,560
Oh, don't help. This isn't who he said he was.

1040
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,560
Ah yes, completely uncut gems. Brilliant.

1041
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,560
It's just pop rocks.

1042
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,560
Whoops, I'm too late. Bitch already corrupted. Well, fuck.

1043
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:02,560
Wait, how is it corrupted?

1044
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,560
Wait, what if that's...

1045
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,560
Sauron was just like...

1046
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:09,560
Those are Sauron's rings.

1047
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,560
Sauron was just like, listen, if you use gold and silver, it'll actually make them my rings.

1048
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,560
Why?

1049
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,560
Yes, you've already shown us this shot. You missed your opportunity to end credit screen.

1050
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,560
Although, that being said, end credit screen in...

1051
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,560
What, ten seconds?

1052
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,560
We need to see what Halbran's doing.

1053
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,560
He's going to Mordor, of course.

1054
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Yes, I'd like a tower right over there.

1055
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:44,560
No, a little bit more to the right.

1056
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:51,560
Now end credit in five, four, three, two, one.

1057
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,560
Blackness.

1058
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,560
Nice hovering your mouse ahead, Barch.

1059
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:02,560
You little shit.

1060
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:08,560
I like how they're now singing, how they were actually made, and they've shown that, no, they didn't do that.

1061
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,560
I feel like I just had an hour-long aneurysm.

1062
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,560
This is more funny.

1063
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:23,560
No, no, the issue is, once more, they've completely violated absolutely everything.

1064
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,560
There's no reason for the story to progress at this point.

1065
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,560
The elves have made their rings completely separate from anything else.

1066
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:40,560
Halbran had no influence on these three rings whatsoever beyond going,

1067
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,560
maybe you should put them in a centrifuge instead.

1068
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,560
There is no reason or rationale for him to have any power over them.

1069
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:57,560
It was very specifically made clear in the original that the rings were made by Sauron's direction.

1070
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:03,560
He'd pre-planned this. He had written it into those rings that they would be bound by the Wand Ring.

1071
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,560
It's literally coded into them, but there's no reason for these rings to be.

1072
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,560
Now, what is the rationale for making more?

1073
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,560
They'll make up a rationale.

1074
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,560
That's exactly the problem. They will just make it the fuck up.

1075
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,560
Well, that's been the whole problem with the entire show since episode one.

1076
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:28,560
It's all made up. None of this matters. None of this has mattered since the beginning.

1077
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,560
None of this mattered now.

1078
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:36,560
Let's assume that you wanted to do the exact same plot line, but good.

1079
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,560
The plot already sucks, but let's assume all the major plot beats are going to be in place.

1080
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:48,560
We're talking that the elves still need the mithril to stay alive.

1081
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:58,560
Halbran is still going to be Sauron in the end and still finds Galadriel.

1082
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,560
How would you do this show but better?

1083
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Well, you'd actually have to take more time and develop an actual blossoming relationship between Galadriel and Halbran.

1084
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,560
There would have to be a real seduction there.

1085
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:17,560
He would actually have to worm his way into places a little bit more.

1086
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,560
He did that a bit on Numenor. He didn't do it anywhere else.

1087
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:29,560
And honestly, it feels like they had to do that big battle scene in the Southlands to turn it into Mordor,

1088
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:39,560
and they had to get Halbran from Mordor to Lindon to have the let's corrupt the elves bit to make the rings,

1089
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,560
and then have him reveal himself. They just rushed it all. They had it all in one episode.

1090
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,560
That should have been a full season on its own, Halbran with the elves.

1091
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,560
This I'm about to agree with you, and so this is a question about time.

1092
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:59,560
Halbran's character needed far more development, but it's a question of using the time.

1093
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:06,560
The show has so much time, but it's wasted on stupid shit.

1094
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:12,560
The problem is too, Halbran was sus from the beginning because he's a king of the Southlands.

1095
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:19,560
We know that's not true. He's been set adrift by corsairs. We know that's not true.

1096
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:24,560
This is an era of unrivalled peace, and he's in the middle of nowhere.

1097
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:35,560
The setup is far too suspect for anyone to ever look at Halbran with a neutral view, because he's set up that way.

1098
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:42,560
The show falls into its own trap, where it's like, okay, we need everyone to think that everybody's Sauron,

1099
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:49,560
but that just means that your Sauron reveal will fall flat regardless of which character you make Sauron.

1100
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:56,560
It's the same problem with the wizard. They've gone back and forth on him being good and evil like six or seven times,

1101
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:05,560
and even now, the only claim to him being good is that he says that he's an Istar, and then there's a Maiar more correctly,

1102
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,560
which, again, Sauron's a Maiar too.

1103
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:13,560
There's also the obvious copyright problems here, and this is one of the things where Amazon is just going to do this

1104
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:22,560
because they know the Tolkien estate can't challenge them, but the wizards are specifically a Third Age property.

1105
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:31,560
Amazon does not have the copyright to them in the same way that they do not have the copyright to the hobbits, which is why they're harfoots.

1106
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:38,560
Well, Arch, these are just going to be some new wizards that we haven't seen before, and they're all going to die before the Third Age.

1107
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,560
That would be the way they'd have to do it.

1108
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:49,560
This is something that I've seen with a lot of shows. Any show that has been made in the past five years,

1109
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:55,560
that you see a lot of YouTube channels watching and complaining about, and it's like, oh my god, it's so bad.

1110
00:59:55,560 --> 01:00:06,560
I see this. I can see, deep within all the shit, the foundation of a possibly good show if they just did everything differently.

1111
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:15,560
Ironically, the scenes between Halbaran and Galadriel in this show should have been the culmination of a story.

1112
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:21,560
Instead, he recites a handful of times where Galadriel did a handful of things,

1113
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,560
and that entire story could probably be compacted into a single hour or less.

1114
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,560
It's not enough time, and there's not enough subtlety in the plot.

1115
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:35,560
It needed more time to develop, and it needed more subtlety.

1116
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:41,560
It should have been, what they should have done, that entire scene where Halbaran was like, okay, you made me strong, etc.

1117
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:49,560
That should have been the big reveal. It shouldn't then have had a second reveal scene afterwards.

1118
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:54,560
That should have been the big reveal, because they undermined the second reveal massively as well.

1119
01:00:55,560 --> 01:01:05,560
What you do is, you put them two up, you have like, oh, you know, you drove me, and then you hear the hammer blow of the rings being crafted like dum.

1120
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:12,560
And then you have a flashback to Galadriel chasing him and driving him off so that he ended up on that raft.

1121
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:17,560
You were the one who made me strong and had the dum of the rings being crafted.

1122
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:23,560
And showing her, like, forcing him to run around and become strong and blah blah blah.

1123
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:25,560
Make up something like that, yeah?

1124
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,560
That would have been good, because at that point it would have been too fucking late.

1125
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,560
Galadriel would have realised her error as it was already too late.

1126
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,560
The rings were already crafted, Sauron's plot was already complete, and there's nothing she can do about it.

1127
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:48,560
Instead now, we have to have some roundabout plot where a bunch of more rings need to be crafted.

1128
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:58,560
It will require Galadriel to stay silent about this plot she knows is in the offing, for god only knows how many more seasons.

1129
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:06,560
And it will require Halibrand to also make another master ring without any involvement in the other rings.

1130
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,560
If the secret ingredients is Mithril, we should make another ring.

1131
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:18,560
Just make a ring that says, like, 14 rings, and in the light bind them. Haha!

1132
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:29,560
Just the new version. I also realised we didn't see the black elf, and we didn't see the dwarves this time around.

1133
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,560
I guess they're just out. They're done.

1134
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:36,560
I do think that the black elf storyline is complete though, because that sword arc is over.

1135
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,560
His arc is gone. He has no reason to be on the show anymore.

1136
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,560
They'll have to come up with one.

1137
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:53,560
They won't. I think the story's moving on past that. I think he was just an introductory, like, to the whole fucking back lore as to why Mordor's foundation is.

1138
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:57,560
Because there's an obsession with, we have to demystify everything and show you everything.

1139
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:07,560
Well no, the problem now is, Halbrand's in Mordor, so now there's going to be a conflict with him and Adar, because Adar said specifically that he didn't want to serve Sauron.

1140
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:11,560
And then there'll have to be a redemption arc for him, which will include black elf.

1141
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:17,560
Well, we've got four more seasons to go to see.

1142
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:28,560
You know what's exciting though? The next season's going to be great, and here's why. Because you know their budget's going to be lower, so there's going to be a serious quality drop in everything.

1143
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,560
As the show goes on, it'll probably be comical, I had to hope, right?

1144
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:40,560
Probably. Because already, the only thing that's really impressive about this show is the occasional visuals.

1145
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:47,560
God, the problem too is the shooting. The shooting is so fucking bad.

1146
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:56,560
Halbrand, when he is revealing that he is Sauron, you should be shooting him, you should have a slight shadow on his face.

1147
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:02,560
Or he should look beatific, like he should look angelic almost, with a hint of darkness.

1148
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,560
You should be shooting him from below and up, making him look sinister, and the actor too.

1149
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:18,560
The actor does not deliver here, in the slightest. He looks weak, soft, fleshy, human, shitty.

1150
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:24,560
I don't know if that's necessarily the actor's fault, or more so on the...

1151
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:31,560
Because they waste the special effects. They should do more with it, with the elves. They should do more with it, with the Sauron reveal.

1152
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:43,560
Because imagine if they used all that art and CG effort to really show dark tendrils wrapping around him, and then slowly wrapping around Gladiel, showing that his influence was, he was trying to corrupt her.

1153
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:50,560
Again, you do this scene, you have the hammering of the ring in the background, you have the dark speak beginning to whisper, etc.

1154
01:04:51,560 --> 01:05:03,560
You could make this a fucking impactful scene, and already, already with the shit ingredients we have, already this is a fairly impactful scene.

1155
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,560
Imagine if they'd done it well.

1156
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:11,560
Imagine all the people.

1157
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:16,560
But even if they did it well, it still undermines the entire story.

1158
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:25,560
I just realized, the priestess character looks more otherworldly than anyone else in the show.

1159
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:31,560
She does. It's because of the makeup they have her wear, and the fact that they shorten her hair and give her her contact lenses.

1160
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:37,560
Yeah. The way she moves around and stuff, she actually looks like she's a creature from another world.

1161
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:43,560
You know, I think the actress that played the main witch lady, she did a pretty good job, she was kind of creepy.

1162
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:51,560
But the problem is, I feel bad for all these actors and actresses, even the good ones, is that, you know, what a waste.

1163
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,560
What a waste of talent with a waste of skill.

1164
01:05:57,560 --> 01:05:59,560
Same for the CG artists and everyone else on board this project.

1165
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:05,560
Like damn, all that fucking stuff wasted, because some fucking moron writers had to change a few things.

1166
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:12,560
The Rings of Power audience is actually coping right now, because they are using that, like, at least it's not as bad as Tolkien's work.

1167
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:19,560
And these are like, this is the Rings of Power audience, which goes to show that it's mostly made up of zoomers, because they're like, oh okay.

1168
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,560
Lord of the Rings to them is Rings of Power. Like that's the Lord of the Rings.

1169
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:26,560
I don't even think that's the case.

1170
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:31,560
It's tragic, but it's true. A lot of people know, a lot of the newer generations, and I know them.

1171
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:40,560
And my brothers, like, they're a decade younger than me. Do you ask them what Lord of the Rings is? Peter Jackson films? They'll be like, the what? The who?

1172
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,560
Well hold on, hold on.

1173
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,560
Wow, those are classics.

1174
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,560
They still hold up to this day.

1175
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,560
They do.

1176
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,560
My girlfriend's a zoomer, and she's like, oh yeah, I watched the original LOPRs again.

1177
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,560
Yeah, because you told them.

1178
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:58,560
Oh no, she knew it before me.

1179
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,560
Hmm, well you lucked out. You got a good dice roll.

1180
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:06,560
Most people probably do know, but this is exactly what Amazon wants. Like, I keep making this point.

1181
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:12,560
This will be the future. Amazon is trying to claim the Rings of Power, but Lord of the Rings. That's what they're trying to do.

1182
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,560
They're trying to make this the Lord of the Rings.

1183
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:21,560
And they would have succeeded if they'd put even the barest amount of effort into it.

1184
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:29,560
Because people don't remember. Hell, if people don't remember the Peter Jackson movies, they don't remember the goddamn books. Like, Jesus Christ. None of these people have read the books.

1185
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:39,560
Oh yeah, the books even more so. Like, you're lucky if they've seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy, or the Hobbit trilogy. You're even more lucky if they've read the books.

1186
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:46,560
Amazon had an opportunity here to take over the Lord of the Rings, because they're already doing it. They're already redefining the Lord of the Rings.

1187
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:50,560
They're already rewriting the story. They're already making shit out of whole cloth.

1188
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:56,560
They have an opportunity here to just take it, and own it forever.

1189
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:06,560
But they hired two fucking randoms off the goddamn street. I mean, they must give amazing blowjobs is the only explanation I can possibly posit.

1190
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:12,560
You know what's interesting? They're doing exactly what Disney did to, like, the old Grimm's tales and stuff like that.

1191
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:27,560
Where they're basically taking these ideas, because in the intellectual property sphere, if you take something that's in the, what do you call it, the free space, public domain, and you redefine it, and you make it your own, you can monetise it.

1192
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:37,560
I mean, they do that with Conan all the time. The Conan video games that are coming out lately are a direct result of that, because Conan's in the public domain, if I'm 100% correct there, which I'm pretty sure it is.

1193
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,560
Right now Winnie the Pooh is in the public domain now too.

1194
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:46,560
Yep, so it means you can go and you can turn it into your own stuff, and then you can actually monetise it.

1195
01:08:46,560 --> 01:09:00,560
So technically, yes. What they're going to do is what Disney did. They're going to take those public domain ideas, and what they're going to try to do is warp it and twist it enough for the newer generations, by changing the lore and making it their own, that it will splinter as its own identity.

1196
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:19,560
Yes. Now granted, there's a little bit of a difference here, because what Disney did was not take public domain. Disney took the things during a time when copyright basically didn't exist, and they changed it just enough to not make it the same thing, and they trademarked it specifically.

1197
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:29,560
Like, Disney has no trademark over the original fairy tale, but they do have a trademark over their version of the fairy tale.

1198
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:40,560
It was a clever distinction, which everybody even at the time saw was predatory, but there was no legal framework to stop them, and so, voila.

1199
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:48,560
Whereas now, if you try to make a Snow White story, oh, you best believe there will be some mouse-haired lawyers under your door.

1200
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:54,560
The problem with that is that the IP is actually enforced now, because it's been established under Disney.

1201
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:57,560
Yes, it's enforced by a company.

1202
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,560
Wait, so you can't make a story about Snow White, even though it's like...

1203
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,560
You can technically do it in the fairy-use sense, but you can't monetize it or stuff like that.

1204
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:20,560
What if you just don't use Disney design? The story of Snow White predates Disney.

1205
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,560
There have been people that do that.

1206
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,560
Like, the Alice games by American McGee, they didn't run afoul of Disney at all.

1207
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,560
I'm not familiar with those.

1208
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:40,560
You need to make it so substantially different that it is obviously different.

1209
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:46,560
And even then, you are running a certain amount of risk. You are running a certain amount of gambit.

1210
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:52,560
I just think American McGee might have run into some problem if he made Alice Blonde.

1211
01:10:53,560 --> 01:11:01,560
And the thing is, American McGee's Alice revamps the character, the setting, the story, everything.

1212
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:08,560
It has virtually nothing to do with Alice anymore beyond the generalized aesthetics of Wonderland.

1213
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:13,560
Yeah, that's true. They made it into Tim Burton's Wonderland, almost.

1214
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:22,560
You need to be able to hold out the two products, and then you need to clearly be like, this is not the same as this.

1215
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:30,560
Listen, though, listen. There's some quality hentai out there of American McGee's Alice getting with Disney's Alice.

1216
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,560
My God, the merger's happening.

1217
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,560
There was a point where this show seemed like it might have been good, but then they just dropped the ball so hard.

1218
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:46,560
That just makes no sense to even somebody who isn't particularly familiar with the lore.

1219
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:52,560
This show tries way too hard to explain everything of these big events that happened.

1220
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:59,560
There's no real reason for us to really need to see it, but then the show just goes out of its way to be like,

1221
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,560
Oh, look, look at the thing. Remember in the movies or the books?

1222
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:12,560
Well, this is how the sausage is made, and you're left with the same sort of disgust.

1223
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:20,560
I do like that it kept people guessing with the wizard thing. Maybe they did that thing a bit way too hard, though.

1224
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,560
You liked that?

1225
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:36,560
No, I liked a little bit how the wizard was behaving and stuff. I thought it was pretty funny, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

1226
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:47,560
I also feel like they definitely introduced a bit too much and not spent enough time in places where they should have spent just to develop the more important aspects of the show.

1227
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:58,560
Yeah, you know what I've realized about this? So I think we're all kind of in agreement that there's like a skeleton of a story that could have been good had they actually done it competently here.

1228
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:10,560
I think what they're banking on is that like in 25 years after the show is done, and the zoomers are like middle aged, looking back with nostalgia goggles,

1229
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,560
haven't seen the show since it first came out, they're going to think, oh, man, that was a good show.

1230
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:22,560
You know, the seduction of Galadriel by Halbrand. Man, that was that that was really cool back in the day.

1231
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:30,560
You know, oh, you had that neat scene where like the the wizard, he was he was bumbling around because he's like a newborn in an adult's body.

1232
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:38,560
And like he he has to hang out with the very innocent Harfoot's like, oh, that was like there was some cool character interaction there.

1233
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:44,560
And they're going to like be remembering a completely different show than the actual show that we just watched.

1234
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:49,560
You're thinking it'll get the the Star Wars prequels kind of treatment.

1235
01:13:50,560 --> 01:14:07,560
But yeah, I don't think so. Because the thing is, if you rewatch the Star Wars prequels, they actually do have all of the setup required to deliver Palpatine is actually a pretty fucking conniving and shrewd political coup maker, you know.

1236
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:17,560
All of the steps required to tell that story is there. They should have focused a lot more on it and they should have made a lot more out of it.

1237
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:30,560
But here, the ingredients for Halbrand's seduction of Galadriel basically doesn't exist because he wasn't trying to seduce her up until the point where he was.

1238
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:38,560
Like there was really no point previously where he was actively flirting with her or trying. Like suddenly it's like, be my queen.

1239
01:14:39,560 --> 01:14:46,560
What? This wasn't for if they had if they had had an actual romantic relationships previously.

1240
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:54,560
OK, but they haven't. Like at what point previously have Halbrand and Galadriel interacted in that way?

1241
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:59,560
Like the closest we get is them being sassy at one another occasionally.

1242
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:05,560
There was that one scene, I think after the fight, and they were both sitting down on the logs.

1243
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:16,560
And they kind of like had a weird look where she said, I felt it too. That was I think a couple episodes ago. That was it. It was one scene.

1244
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,560
I don't even remember that fucking scene.

1245
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:29,560
There were a couple scenes throughout the show that they tried to allude to the fact that they were kind of liking each other in a way, but they never really went far with it.

1246
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:39,560
And they also never really did much with it other than they kept doing it. They planted the seeds for it, but they weren't like doing a really good job building it up.

1247
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:49,560
Now, I do agree that that's what the showrunners think that they have done, because they've literally said so in interviews like 20 years. People totally love this. I don't think so.

1248
01:15:50,560 --> 01:16:00,560
I think in 20 years nobody will even remember that this was a thing. Or if they do, they'll just be like, remember when Amazon did something really stupid and it destroyed their studio? Yeah.

1249
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,560
I remember.

1250
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:11,560
There's a lot of epics that have come out, you know, in terms of TV shows and movies. Lord of the Rings, pretty epic.

1251
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:17,560
Harry Potter, I think, qualifies as something that people will still rewatch 10, 20, 50 years down the road.

1252
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:28,560
You know, there's a lot of these shows and a lot of these stories, you know, the original Game of Thrones in the last season, but you know, there's this stuff that will stand the test of time.

1253
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:35,560
Stuff that you could dig up years and years and years later. People will still watch and be like, that was good. Maybe a little bit dated, you know.

1254
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:42,560
I recently rewatched the original Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's slightly dated, but you know what? It's still really, really good.

1255
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:55,560
This show, I think, will be forgotten about. No one watches it in 20 years. No one gives a fuck. No one's going back to their old DVD box sets or whatever. This show will just be gone.

1256
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:01,560
If it will be remembered at all, it will be remembered as Amazon's epic failure.

1257
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:15,560
Yes. It will be remembered for that $5 billion price tag, where they just burnt a giant pile of money like the Joker. What a waste of time this was. God damn it.

1258
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,560
I don't know what you were expecting.
